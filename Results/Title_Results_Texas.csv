11112,0,11-Jun-20,"I bought an ATV from Honda of Brazosport which was owned by Honda of Lake Jackson. When I decided to sell the ATV, I realized I never received the title. I went to Honda of Lake Jackson and gave them proof that I purchased the ATV. The lady in bookkeeping (Lara) showed me the title and told me she would transfer it into my name. That conversation was almost a year ago and I still don't have the title. I will be going to Houston to today to start the process for a bonded title. A lady that I spoke to with the Texas DMV told me Honda of Lake Jackson could have easily taken care of this issue. For me, it will take a trip to Houston, $100 for a bonded title plus paying TT&L a second time to do what they could have done easily nearly a year ago. I am also curious where the $231.88 I paid originally for the TT&L went to. I'm glad I'm not having the same issue over a $70,000 automobile.",1,670,Texas_without_threshold\Honda18 Reviews of Honda of Lake Jackson.csv

16656,1,24-Apr-20,"I bought a car on 2/3/20 from Mazda of Mesquite, I have never received the title or plates. I have gone into the dealership and called numerous times. I was told by Maria in early March the paperwork was at the title office. Then I was told Maria was not working there anymore. After several more phone calls, Steve, Staci, Jeff, Anthony, no one returned my phone calls. The receptionist tells me no title work is being processed, tax office closed, dealership sold…… I finally get a return phone call from Emmitt on 4/24/20, he has no idea where our paperwork is and he is tired of dealing with the tax office. I now have a car with no plates and no title.
Later the morning of the 4/24/20, Emmitt called me aging, said he found my paperwork, it was brought to the tax office yesterday. I informed him, that was all the information I needed. He stated “THIS IS ALL xxxxxxxx”.
I told him it was not necessary to swear, and proceeded to hang up.

Each time I ask about the status I’m given the run around and told they are getting more plates next week. I’m now getting hounded by my credit union because they don’t have the title or even proof that a title application was submitted. My second set of temporary tags expired this week. I asked to get a third set, yet no one will respond to my texts, emails, or phone calls.

21844,2,23-Aug-19,"I purchased a 2016 Subaru for my grad school bound daughter.  We did a trade-in and made full payment on the balance of the Subaru. All I can say is the salesman and finance manager were all about getting the trade-in handled and our payment and not at all about providing what we needed as their customers (which involved timing of getting the title and license plate and which we advised them at the time of the sale).  The information provided by both at the time of the sale was not accurate and communication to get accurate information very difficult and it cost us time and money down the road.  If we had not reached out to someone else at Gillman, we would still be sitting and waiting for the title and license plate which had not been applied for until we inquired further.  Also, the car we purchased immediately starting showing signs of issues, starting with the ignition.  I will never use Gillman again for any vehicle purchase.",1.4,1233,Texas_without_threshold\Subaru15 Reviews of Gillman Subaru Southwest.csv
3978,9,08-Apr-19,"DO NOT BUY HERE AT ALL!!!! 
They have god awful financing! They also royally messed up my title & registration!  First I told them my van needed to be titled & registered in Oregon... apparently they used my address but put Texas as the state! I've been waiting for my registration & plates for 4 months!!!! I've called every month & they keep saying they are working on it... so I finally broke down & called the Oregon DMV & asked what they needed to approve my title & registration. They said they never got anything for my vehicles VIN number.  So then I called USAA who I insured under.  They also didn't have the title or any paperwork for the sale... so I called the Texas DMV... they had the vehicle titled but here's the biggest shocker... THE TITLE ISNT IN MY NAME!!!! 

So now I'm at the DMV trying to figure out who owns my van that I've been paying on & why this dealer thought when I paid them Oregon tax & registration that I was registering in Texas & have my Oregon address all over the paperwork I signed! 

I was just staying in Texas with my mom for the winter & well now I'm stuck here since I can't drive my new van up to Oregon!!!!!",1.6,293,Texas_without_threshold\Chrysler25 Reviews of Texan Dodge Chrysler Jeep Ram.csv
11961,20,29-Mar-19,"Stay far away from Fenton Hyundai!! I purchased a new car there five months ago. I still don't have the title and plates for that car. According to the investigator assigned to my case with the Texas DMV, there is now little chance that Fenton is going to provide the title and plates for my car or any of the other multiple complaints they've received. I have been advised that I will quite likely have to obtain a bonded title, which will cost $500+. They're hopeful I won't have to pay the sales tax again, but no one is sure about that. So bottom line is that I may be out in excess of $2000 more than what I've already paid to *finally* get the title and the license plates for this car. So be advised that if you buy a car here you will quite likely find yourself in the same situation.

11971,30,17-Feb-19,"BUYER BEWARE!! fenton Hyundai is selling cars and collecting money to pay the tax title and license fees but are not sending the money in!  They are selling the dealership and say the tt and l fees are in limbo.  They have done this to several customers and as of February 16, 2018, I do not have the registration or title to a 2018 Sonata I purchased there on November 17,, 2018.

I have called numerous times and have asked to speak to the title clerk, managers, and the General Manager, Patrick Davalos.  I have not received a single call back.  Read other reviews, others who bought cars from Fenton Hyundai are going through the same thing!

11972,31,14-Feb-19,"1st issue: Would not honor the internet advertised price.  I ended up paying $2k more (talked them down from almost $4k more)

2nd issue: I was paying cash for the car because insurance paid to replace a totaled car and I was in the middle of refinancing my house and did not want to touch my credit.  They continued to pressure me to finance and kept changing the cash price.  At at least two points they tried to sneak credit check agreements into other paperwork.  

3rd issue: After leaving with the car, I discovered that one of the interior panels (over the passenger seat belt) was loose.  It had been fixed enough to not show on a walkaround and test drive, but the clips underneath were bent and it popped off after one day of driving.

Despite all of that, I would not have written this review.  I got the car I wanted and could afford and was just going to write them off as a shady used car dealer to avoid in the future.  But now, 5 months after my purchase, they still have not applied for my title or registration. I have tried calling and emailing the sales and finance people at the dealership, the corporate office (Morgan Payne who is in charge of titles, and her boss Vic Walker the controller) - no response from anyone, and I'm not able to get through to anyone other than receptionists.  The last person I talked to on the phone once I threatened to complain to the TxDMV explained that the dealer's accounts had been frozen since October and no titles had been applied for at all. So now, I've complained to the DMV and have to wait 15 business days for them to respond, and I MIGHT get a title and plates after that, or I might have to take them to court.  

Save yourself months of hassle - stay FAR, FAR away from this dealer. ",1,701,Texas_without_threshold\Hyundai105 Reviews of Fenton Hyundai.csv

18949,12,02-Aug-18,"Beware of this dealership. At the moment we are not sure whether they are extremely careless or wilfully delaying processes, but we intend to find out and report them. More than three months after buying a car we still do not know if our title paperwork has been filed - although we know that it wasn't filed as recently as last week. To be clear, they are legally required to file this paperwork within 30 days of purchase. The worst part is that Nissan Town North simply do not care.

We bought a car from them in April. Long story short, they ordered the wrong car, and after trying to coerce us into taking a different car, reluctantly were able to locate a car in the color and model that we had actually purchased. We had to wait three weeks, but at the start of May we got the car we had originally ordered. That car was hit by a truck a few days later. Thankfully my husband was unharmed, but the car was damaged. Geico declared it a total loss in June. We had to reach out to Nissan Town North for evidence of title. Some time later in July someone in finance sent us a title application. We have to assume that the original title paperwork was never filed. 

Weeks later we were told that the title paperwork was filed incorrectly. We went back in twelve days ago and resigned, and were assured it would be filed within a couple of days. We finally heard back to repeated messages two days ago, and nobody was able to tell us if the paperwork was filed. Yesterday - after tracking down a Manager - we heard back, but regarding the wrong car (we also bought a Rogue from them earlier in the year). NOBODY CAN TELL US IF THEY HAVE FILED THIS PAPERWORK AFTER MORE THAN THREE MONTHS. 

Meanwhile, we have an outstanding insurance claim that Geico are waiting to pay when we have the paperwork. Which means we have made three car payments to Nissan for a car that was totalled three months ago while we wait - and wait - for them to actually do something that they were legally required to do within 30 days of purchase. 

I can't even express how angry it makes me to be treated this way, or to know that we cannot trust a car dealership to file title paperwork. They do not care. Their attitude is incredible - shockingly - casual. No explanations. No apologies. 

It's hard to believe that things are so chaotic that they literally do not know if this paperwork was filed, which leads me to suspect that it is wilfullly being delayed, or that even more mistakes have been made by people who could not care less about their customers.",1,1098,Texas_without_threshold\Nissan57 Reviews of Town North Nissan.csv

11993,52,09-Aug-17,"I purchased a used car on 05/29/17 which needed some repairs/parts replaced based on just looking at the car. These items were included in their ""I owe you"" sheet. After purchasing the car it literally took 14 phone calls for them to order some of the parts and install them. The car had a few small dents which I was assured would be taken care of and still haven't. They refused to order one of the parts that the car needs. The biggest headache of all has been/still is getting the license plates/title of the car. It has 2 1/2 months and I am still waiting. They sold me the car without doing an inspection, which should have been done. When my temporary license plates were 2 weeks from expiring I called and talked to the sales manager, Will Schmidt, who said he would look into it and call me back. He never did, we spoke a few more times over the weeks and he ended every conversation like that but never called. I was able to speak to the title clerk at another dealership and she told me that the car needed to be brought back in for inspection, which I performed immediately. Now it has been 1 month and after many more calls I found out that the title clerk is no longer there, my application wasn't submitted until 10 days ago and yesterday it came back with some items missing.
