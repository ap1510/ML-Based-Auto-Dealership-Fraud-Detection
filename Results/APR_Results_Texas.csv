10153,0,13-Jun-20,"I purchased a 2019 ""new"" Ford Ranger from Tommy Ellis. I say ""new"" because it was previously used as a loaner vehicle for the dealership so it had about 2,400 miles on it.

You'll find that the dealership is split from Sherman and Denison and if you show up to the wrong location, you get to drive back and forth (roughly a 15 minute drive one way). Not a huge deal, just inefficient and a waste of time.

They gave a lowball offer for my trade-in (significantly lower than the KBB instant cash value price), but I accepted it. They listed the vehicle on their website for just under three times more than what they offered within a couple days.

I didn't much care for negotiating with the sales manager who proceeded to just walk away while talking. It may be a negotiating tactic, albeit a rude one.

The finance manager, Chris McClour, was probably the best finance person I'd ever worked with. He offered the standard extended warranties and gap insurance pitch, but in no way did he push it further when you said no. He was the best interaction I had during the entire process.

Speaking of finance, I opted to use the Ford financing since you get an additional $750 rebate for doing so. My credit score was 815. The rate they gave me was 7.4%. Read that again. Credit score of 815 gets an APR of 7.4%. xxx kind of rate do you get if your credit score was in the 600s? 20%??? Are they using a loan shark?

Whoever did the tint job on the driver side window applied the tint on top of some writing on the window. They had to remove it and reapply the tint. How that happened to begin with was a solid ""not my job"". When asked how long that would take, I was told 20 minutes. In reality, it took 40 minutes. I had been there four hours by this point. The tint they redid has a bunch of bubbles at the top. They tacked on $299 onto the cost of the truck for tint. For $299, I would expect a better job. The rear windows and back windows came standard with privacy glass and no tint was applied to those windows. It was $299 for TWO windows, the driver and passenger. I've had an entire SUV tinted (all 4 windows + massive sunroof + rear) tinted for $300 with a lifetime warranty included. Complete ripoff that comes with poor workmanship. There's also no way to remove this charge since they just go ahead and do it to their vehicles. The charge isn't listed online, but when you show up, your financial sheet will have an additional $299 on it for tint. Go ahead and add that amount to whatever price you see online.

The vehicle itself was not detailed or cleaned prior to being available for purchase. There were still loaner contracts in the glovebox and dirt / scratches / scuffs inside.

My biggest gripe is I have been trying to reach Tommy to address a few minor issues I found with the truck. I have left him a voicemail on his cell AND on his office phone, two different days. Four days later, still no callback. They take your money and then disappear off the face of the earth. I'll update this review if they ever actually call back, which I highly doubt.",2.2,596,Texas_without_threshold\Ford9 Reviews of Bob Utter Ford Lincoln .csv
18460,0,11-Jun-20,"Found a truck on Autotrader, also looked it up on the dealership website, and sent an inquiry from their website. Asked for the out the door (OTD) price in the initial inquiry. Received a response from two different individuals from the sales department, neither addressed, nor included the OTD quote. Most places require two prompts for the OTD price, so nothing out of the ordinary yet.

One response included the subject “Crest Nissan is honored to assist you”. Sounds good, but as the communications continue, seemingly just empty words in the end, no substance. The email I received from the “Internet Sales Manager” included this phrase: “My ultimate goal is to make sure you have an exceptional experience here at Crest Nissan, and to make sure you have all the information you need to make an informed decision.” More placebo.

Also of note is that when I first found the truck the advertised price on both platforms was $16498. That was Saturday, and by Sunday it was $17548. A couple of days later it showed to be $16952, with a note on one of the pictures of the truck (on their website) price lowered! Is it really lowered when you raised the price previously? And on 6/11/2020 the price shows $16948.

Asked for the OTD price a third time, still no response, just another question about when I could come see the truck. At this point I began to question the lack of pricing transparency, first red flag. Second red flag, the changing sales price.

I requested the OTD price again explaining that my financial institution needed to know the OTD price to provide an accurate interest rate, since that is based on the loan to value ratio. I did not hear back from Shon (he might have been busy, or off that day), so I forwarded the email to Mark. I was then informed of this bit of info by Mark: “We price our vehicles assuming our customers will be financing with us.” Reading between the lines I asked if this meant the price of the truck would be higher if I had my own financing. Mark replied with: “It's 10% higher, and we can most likely get whatever your bank is giving you.” Third red flag! This was not disclosed anywhere on either platform.

Why would a stealership “force” you to finance with them??? So they can make their money on an inflated interest rate. The advice has always been, have your financing lined up prior to stepping foot into a dealership. This is helpful in determining how much you are able to borrow, and the interest rate, which too will impact what you can afford on a monthly basis… remember the phrase “to make sure you have all the information you need to make an informed decision.”

Oddly enough I also received an email from the Internet Sales Director to check in with me. His email included this phrase: “I also wanted to let you know about our Best Price Guarantee and our 3-day, no hassle, return policy. Overall, I want to make sure you are completely satisfied! “

I replied to the Internet Sales Director to state my observations up to this point. It appears that this was forwarded to Shon, who then replied. In his reply he stated: “negotiations are always done best in person to make sure you're serious, and not curious”. The reason for internet departments is to cut through the chase, agree on a price (which is listed online), and barring any issues with the vehicle makes it a done deal. Regarding “serious, and not curious”, does that not contradict the “make an informed decision” comment? If you are not willing to inform a curious customer, he will not turn into a serious buyer.

He also stated: “If you would like me to print the numbers up for you so we can work a deal before you arrive, I have no problem with that.” To which I commented “I have asked for the out the door price three, or four times, so I am unclear as to why this would still be a question at this point.” Regarding his statement “So we can work a deal before I arrive” What is there left to negotiate? The price should be the advertised price, plus applicable taxes (inventory tax, sales tax, title & registration fees), and any document fees your dealership charges.”

When I inquired with my financial institution about an estimated OTD price of $18500, that was already at 108% loan to value. So if Crest were to add many of the fees on that are mentioned in many of other reviews, it would increase the interest rate even more.

Oddly enough, no response back from Shon, not even 24 hours later - why would that be? Because he already knows that the bogus, and unrealistic additional charges will not be accepted? It makes it appear as they only like to deal with customers they can bully, or are so timid that they will just accept all of the charges they want to tack on, after they get you in the door. Any dealership that is truly transparent with their pricing will let you know up front what the out the door price is and honor it when you walk in the door.

Many reviews have mentioned this stealerships practice of listing a sales price, want you to come into the stealership and then inflate the price. As well as wanting to run a credit check right away. 

Most dealerships have adopted to the new age, this dealership appears to still use sales tactics from the 1970's.

Same standard reply on negative reviews: ""we take customer satisfaction very seriously here at Crest Nissan, and we’d love to hear more about your experience."" How about fixing the issues from the start, change your unprofessional business tactics, and you will not have a need to fix them after the fact.

When reviewers mention the additional charges for dealer prep, etc. that they refused to pay the response from Crest is usually ""Unfortunately, we are not always able to come to an agreement on pricing"". This has nothing to do with ""pricing"", you advertised a sales price online, that:
a. you increase when outside financing is used
b. apparently charge for certified warranties on vehicle that were advertised as certified to begin with
c. apparently  charge dealer prep/dealer added ""options"" on used cars",1,1084,Texas_without_threshold\Nissan38 Reviews of Crest Nissan.csv
5408,0,02-Jun-20,"My husband was looking for a Ram truck for himself. We decided on a Ram Rebel 2019. The salesman Jimmy, who was very nice, told my husband of a $1900 extra fee placed on all vehicles that were on their lot. My husband and I thought that was ridiculous and stupid. So, basically the red tag sales on their lot do not save you anything because they recoup the money with this required fee! We were uncomfortable with that but we liked the truck so much that we were going to agree to it. The kicker that made us leave was when we had to meet the sales manager requested by  our salesman. The sales manager would not even consider us financing through anyone but them even though we had a better interest rate through our bank. He lost a sale and he could have cared less with his arrogant stance.  I guess he didn’t need to sell a truck that bad!

19134,1,27-May-20,"DECEPTIVE & SHADY... Take your business elsewhere. The prices they post on Autotrader and their dealership website are $6k-$7k less than the true sales prices. Online, the car we were interested in was marketed as $16,200 plus TT&L. When we got there, they let us know they couldn't sell it for less than $23k. They also marketed the APR as 0.9% for those with near perfect credit. Surprise, surprise when we came in, their best interest rate for 60 months on new cars was suddenly 3.99%. When we walked out, they followed us saying that if we'd stay, they'd give us the car for $16,900 out the door after ALL fees and features. We agreed, but while we were signing final paperwork, they removed features originally included with the car without telling us even though those features were part of the car we agreed to purchase. Now, no one at the dealership will take our calls, return our emails, or send us copies of the paperwork we signed showing that these features were specifically listed on the paperwork we initially signed for the vehicle. Our 18 yr old daughter is now forced to either return the new car she worked so hard to earn or get over the fact they stripped it of the bells and whistles we were specifically looking for to protect her and her new car.

17853,3,25-May-20,"IF I COULD I WOULD GIVE THIS DEALER A NEGATIVE RATING!!!!!!!!!!!!

I currently Have a 2018 Nissan Armada,   Like it except two things, outdated technology and bad gas mileage.   However this dealer promoted 0% interest rates this weekend and reached out to ask questions about  2020 models, if technology had been updated since 2018, their advertised discounts on the vehicle I was interested in and the 0% interest rates.  Financially it would make sense to buy a new 2020 vehicle at 0% interest  vs. keeping my current vehicle at my current rate.   

I chatted with or spoke to 4-5 ppl over 3 days.  I even texted with a finance manager who verified the car had Apple Car Play and Also said I could 0% interest based on my reported credit score after they validated my credit score. I explained i will only come if these two items can be assured.  Which he did.   

Thinking I was dealing with a reputable dealer and getting confirmation on my deal breakers I went to the dealer.   Thats when I realized all the lies multiple ppl told me.   In fact, apple care play is not available on any Aramada even though their website specifically says other wise.  The lie is repeated on every individual Aramada SL and Platinum models in stock.   I'm Smart enough not to fall for their sleazy car sales lingo and after a lengthy conversation they admitted their website was wrong.   They know they are mis advertising their cars to get you to come in.  Then they asked what I was currently paying on my Aramada.   Again, Im smart enough Never to fall for this sleazy sales tactic.    Dont for fall for that trick,  you'll Get screwed. Its another way they try and manipulate you.  

Thinking a  0% loan on a 2020 would be a better financial move, I started talking price and financial Terms and they repeatedly lied again.   Suddenly the sales price increased from the online posted  sticker price online for the specific car I was interested in.    Their offer also didnt discount the car the same amt as advertised online.   More lies.   Next they tried to add a $2995.00  junk fee for the dealer to provide their regular day to day services you get buying a car. I called them out on every lie and manipulation.  On round three of negotiations,   I was now told 0% interest rate was not available on Armadas at all.   Hard to know where the degree of lying occurred here.  Either 0% is never offered on Armada's or they will only Give you 0% interest rate if you are willing to way over pay on a vehicle to the tune of $5-6K in my instance.  

Buyer beware!   I will never buy a car from Clay Cooley!   They  tell lies after lies after lies to sell over priced cars

Be an educated consumer.   Get approved for financing at a bank before going to dealer.   Make them itemize every detail About your deal before agreeing or signing anything.  If they tried to offer a deal with a piece of paper consisting of 4 blocks with their offer.  Tear it up in front of them.  Demand to have a formal
Line item detailed offer with all the specifics of the offer.   Sales price, discounts,   Any additional dealer junk fees they try to add, interest rate, term of loan, etc.     Then verify the sales price and discounts available against what is listed online for The specific vehicle ID number you want.  

Also, never answer their question about what you want your car payment to be.  Another sleazy sales tactic that will cause you to over pay!",1,1058,Texas_without_threshold\Nissan114 Reviews of Clay Cooley Nissan.csv
12496,0,17-May-20,"I was told by ""Acia"" (over the phone) that I could get the online price (~$44K ($14,850 in discounts/cash)) PLUS 0% financing through Nissan. She had no idea what she was talking - I only found that out once I started working with Heather.  Heather then told me I could get the 0% financing through Nissan, but I wasn't eligible for the Nissan Cash (now the price is ~$49K).  When I went to sign my paperwork for my new vehicle, the finance guy (can't remember his name) told I could get the 0% financing through Nissan, but the not all the discounts Heather told me I could get.  NOW the price of the truck is well over $50K.  In the short span of an hour, the truck I wanted went from $44K to over $50K.  Talk about a bait and switch.  So, I'm still at the dealership and faced with a decision; do I take the high-priced bait and switch offer to get 0% from Nissan, or do I get my own loan though my bank to get the original $44K online offer?  While I'm crunching the numbers and determining the benefit of 0% (with a higher priced truck) or a substantially lower priced truck (with a loan from my bank), the General Manager (GM) decides to run my credit (hard credit pull).  I called my bank (not knowing what the General Manager was doing) and spoke with them about my loan application - I negotiated a MUCH better rate (2.69%) than when I checked the rates earlier in the morning.  After the GM pulled my credit, I'm brought a piece of paper with other bank offers - none of them came close to my bank.  I rejected the other bank offers and then...  The senior finance guy comes out (I don't remember his name).  He tries to tell me that I'd ""really being helping out World Car Nissan and other customers"" if I took one of their preferred banks' offers.  I explained to the finance guy how three different people told me three different prices for the exact same truck and then told him I was not interested in helping out the dealership that deals the way they do.  During this whole process, I spoke with the GM (Leon Reid) three times.  Each time, he heard what I was saying, but I could see he wasn't listening (he was already preparing what he wanted to say while I was speaking).  Each time, he never addressed the issue - his people are completely untrained and don't know how the rebates/discounts work.  His response each time was how he was basically doing me a favor by speaking with me (while trying to be my pal and telling me how he's ""down in the trenches with all the sales people"").  I was completely underwhelmed with him and his staff.  Bottom Line:  Don't trust what is on their website, or what you are told by anyone there.  Get EVERYTHING in writing from EVERYONE and hold them accountable.",1.8,733,Texas_without_threshold\Hyundai43 Reviews of World Car Nissan Hyundai North.csv
2145,1,16-May-20,"I have NEVER experienced such dishonesty in my life! I went in because they had a 2019 Acadia that was priced great! I think they had accidentally mis-priced it, and wouldn't admit it to me. So, they obviously decided they would get my money somehow!! I told the salesman that I decided that I would buy it, and told them that I would be putting 2k down. 

The next day, I was supposed to show up and sign the paperwork and told the salesman that I had gotten pre-approved financing through a credit union. He then proceeded to tell me that they would only sell me the car if I financed through GM Financial. Needless to say, I was LIVID!! No dealership can tell you who you can finance with. I had a 2.7% APR from the Credit Union. They couldn't even come close to that with GM Financial. I told him (and his ""manager"") what I thought of them. 

Two hours later, I had purchased a beautiful 2018 Silver Acadia with 2.39% from another dealership (GMC). (I have Excellent credit, so don't expect they could get you anything quite that low.) They had found that APR because of their relationship with Capital One!! So I saved even more!!

3339,4,09-Apr-20,"Some of the worst customer service I've ever experienced!

I verified with the saleswoman, Kendra through email that the vehicle I had been looking at was still in stock. 

Because if the Covid-19 I asked if we could do everything without me having to come into the dealership and risk exposure. 
On the phone she verified that, that was completely ok given the circumstance and that if approved the dealership would deliver the vehicle to me. She knew I lived an hour and a half away, but I asked one more time to be sure that I understand correctly about delivery that far away, I was reassured that, that was the case. 
At that time, after having the email verification, the verbal verification, and the confirmation that it would be able to be delivered to me if I was approved to get the loan. 
I gave permission to be sent a credit application via email. 

I have class A credit and do not just let places run my credit, I was preapproved for the loan. Kendra then text me saying that I was pre approved and that the bank was requesting a few documents and asking when I would have time to stop by with those documents and test drive the vehicle. That was at 5:30pm, she said she was working till 8 that night. 

I responded to her text saying I could send documentation through email that I was not wanting to come into the dealership because of risk of exposure to the coronavirus. She never responded to my two text... I called more than once and left one voicemail. 

After almost two hours of no reply on her part I tried to reach the finance department myself and had no luck at getting anyone to answer. I then asked if the receptionist could page kendra or if I could possibly speak with another sales person and she told me that they had went home for the day, but she could transfer me to a sales manager, Daniel. 

I spoke with Daniel about the car, he had no idea which vehicle I was talking about, but seen my preapproval. He said the vehicle wasn't showing up on the website but he was sending someone out into the lot to verify if they still had it and he would call me back... I never heard back from him. 

Fast forward to the next morning.

A call was put in complaining about the experience and was told they would ""investigate it"" and get back to me.

No follow up call was ever received. 
So yet another call was put in, sales manager, Daniel apologized that ""she didn't know they were working a deal with someone at the time, and that as we spoke it was being test driven."" 

So twenty-two hours after my preapproval email was received, the vehicle was just being test driven by someone else?! 

I was not mad that the vehicle was not available, I was mad that I was told it was and gave permission under false promises that is was available. Only to find out that the dealership actually did still have possession of the vehicle the whole time I was told that it has been sold. 

This is where I lost my cool, I told Daniel that I don't make mistakes where my money is concerned, I researched vehicles for weeks, I verified more than once with the saleswoman, I had a paper trail and I expected them to find me the same vehicle since they had promised me the vehicle and and is now selling it to someone else. 

Daniel hung up on me. 

The GM then called and said
""everyone runs their credit and a preapproval doesn't mean anything"",
""a paper trail doesn't change anything"", ""they don't have to find me a car"" 

1) No. Not everyone does run their credit.
I work very hard to keep my credit score where it is. 
2) A paper trail stands up in court and absolutely changes everything, word of mouth is futile, but a paper trail is solid. 
3) No, they absolutely do not HAVE to find me a car, but being in the service industry customer's are (or should be) you main focus. 

I never demanded anything absurd, I asked for them to find me a similar car. 

Which would have still been a sale. Which would have still been commission. 
Even though I had been shown that the customer service proved to be terrible by that point, I didn't want the hits on my credit to be futile. That shows how seriously I take my credit score!

I went over there after finding a vehicle online trying to avoid hours of waiting, I told them exactly what I was looking for and where I needed to be numbers wise, after 3 hours there they called me to the finance office and the finance manager Victor  Told me “You are approved for $0 down and a monthly payment of $352 but is late and I want to call a couple other banks tomorrow morning to see if I can get you a better APR” so I asked him 3 times: so I am already approved for $352 correct? And he said “Yes, that’s a fact, it’s a done deal, let’s go get your new car and you can come back tomorrow to finish with the paperwork “ we came back home with the car after the finance manager told me it was a done deal. Two days after they called me to go and finish the paperwork, but surprise!! When the guy came with some numbers completely different and saying that because it was late the bank gave him a number and they change it later.... what the h is that supposed to mean??? He showed me the numbers, had me sign the agreement and then he was trying to tell me that I needed to purchase a brand new vehicle instead of an used one in order to be in that payment range, to me that is a just trying to sell something more expensive by lying to your customers, so after 3 more hours of stupidity I had to take my old car back. The only 2 people that really tried to work with me and really helped me where the sales guy Michael Stewart and his manager. So if you want to have a nice experience don’t you ever go to this dealership, they are going to lie to you in your face just to try to make you purchase something completely different and way more expensive and out of your budget than what you had in mind.",1,727,Texas_without_threshold\Hyundai32 Reviews of Sterling McCall Hyundai.csv

I found integrity lacking.  The finance people were nothing but lacking in integrity. After review of the edocs given after the sale, I found most forms are not complete.  The sales tactic included payment info prior to repeated requests for an interest rate offer to both the sales person and the finance rep.  Sales person committed 3 years maintenance program free and finance said it did not apply to my purchase.  After having the sales person come into the finance office and apologize for his 'mistake' we informed him that was not acceptable.

Emailed with a salesman for 2 days, confirmed everything about the deal - including that we had our own financing to which he said come on out and test drive and we can get the deal done.  Drove 2 hrs to test drive the car.  Car was great, but advertised at 37 miles, now has 1,200 - not a huge big deal, right?  Also advertised that it was black, black interior - obviously not, pics show gray - again, no big deal.  Test drove, loved it.  Upon test drive return, I tried to confirm the internet price of $15,963.  Was told he ""really didn't know the price"" but regardless, I would have to use their financing to get the internet price.  THAT was my first major clue, but I thought I'd try to make it work.  I gave them my pre-approved interest rates - said DO NOT run my credit unless you can beat that rate.  They ran my credit and then came out and told me there was an ERROR on the internet pricing and the car price was REALLY $19,999....due to their ""3rd party vendor"" mistake, it was listed wrong and they won't honor the price it's listed at, $15,963.  Tried to get me to finance through them at some astronomical rate and then just refinance with my bank in a few months...... WHAT THE ?#$%??????  How stupid do you think I am???

The I get a call from the first sell person John C. I tell him I'm very busy and my last car I bought was though Carvana which kind spoiled me (by the way very seamless and straight forward), I said I do wan to come down there and sit in a dealership all day for ya'll to tell me what you can or can't do. If you tell me you go a deal I will come down. He tells me to fill out an app online. After I filled out my app I text him and let him know and he never got back to me, so that alerted me right then so I text back and say don't run my credit. About 20 minutes after that I start getting alert saying that Clay Cooley ran my credit smh. Then a few calls and some text from someone named Will B saying that he was calling from Capital One Bank and that he works out of Clay Cooley he said that he needed a copy of my Drivers license and check stubs to he can process my loan. So I was like ok maybe they go me financed. I asked him for his email so that I can email it to him from work and he gave me a yahoo email. So from that point I didn't send any identifying information. Then Comes John F. lol (another joke) I tell him that I'm tired I don't want to keep doing this it's frustrating, he was like ""no we can get you a deal"" I was up front about my situation from the beginning, I'm upside down on my current car I want to trade it in. I know that I'm going to have to pay more for my note my credit score is a 643 and I have more than one car loan however they have never been late. He said oh no I can get you a deal. We go back  and forth for a while then he said I got you a deal come on in (xxxxxxxxx again) I come down after work. Get there and he bring to his office and says he'll be right back he goes to finance talks to him then goes and deal with his other customers. Then ask me do have I have someone that can co-sign. I just laughed and said if I needed a co-signer then why didn't tell me that before. He said because he just found out. I said you said you had a deal. Then he said he'll be right back again and this big tall guy walks in there mind you I dealt with him before at Nissan he was disrespectful then and I guess they use him for intimidation. He tell me that I need a down payment I said how much then he leave out and I wait another 15 minutes and I called John F and told him that I was leaving. I tell John that he full of it and I'm going to write a review about the way I was treated then he said let me help you. He comes back and says that he found a deal for 2800 and my notes would be 589 I say that I don't have 2800 he said he'll check with the bank again and the bank is Westlake financial. I said that I can't pay that much down it's right after Christmas I have a $1000 then he said $1500, I said I have $1000. He said ok Ill call the bank tomorrow he never called back I had to call him then when I did he said with someone with Credit like yours they wanted $4000 I talked them down to $2800.00 So I said show me the deal in writing and I never heard back from them.

So I call finance manager and he says don’t worry about it an to send my  new income and I find you new bank an keep car until. Month go by and I call finance manager to check status of deal and he plays like he don’t know anything  from previous conversation and says the dealer will file missing vechile report if I don’t bring car back and I told him well you told keep it until you find me a dealer . So then he calls says I can find you another when bring car up I then said no I want down payment back and I will go somewhere else. Me and my dad brought car back up to dealership and finance dodge us whole time sent salesman out and said call accounting for down payment money and I called and lady in accounting she don’t know anything.

22083,14,02-Dec-19,"Called me back to resign finance agreement and swindled me out of my rebate.  This was my 4th brand new Toyota that I purchased from a dealership and this was the worst experience I have had with any dealer.
Takes three hours to purchase a car and go through financing.  I purchased a Camry, financed through Toyota and got my daughter to sign docs so that we could get $500 rebate.  The salesperson said that Toyota would mail a check to us or reduce the loan.  I confirmed this twice.  Signed docs and drove off.
Two days later received a phone call from Finance rep and said they got me a lower interest rate - less monthly payment and everything else would be same.  Cool.  Go back to sign and drove off.
Two months later asked Toyota regarding my rebate and they said it was in the doc and applied to purchase.  I reviewed the agreement and they switched the amounts from the first doc to the second.  I should have reviewed again, but thought I would trust them since I have never had a bad experience before.  I guess my good luck ran out.

Called Toyota and they said dealer will call me back.  No one ever called.  Very upset and disappointed. 

I would suggest you go somewhere else and read and read and re-read before signing.

There is so much to cover and I'm not in the habit of leaving negative feedback, even when mediocre service is tendered.  However in this instance I think that for the sake of future buyers at your dealership I should say something. 

My experience in a nut shell. 
     Pros:  * Brian Rojas was attentive, personable and helpful as my salesperson.
               * The vehicle was in the condition it was advertised as being, and was delivered clean and full of fuel. 

      Cons:
                 * I made it implicitly clear with my salesperson and the sales manager, that I had guaranteed financing with my bank and that this would be treated as a cash deal.  They said they needed my credit information to run a quick check to ensure my information was valid.   I said to the salesperson ""You are not running my credit for financing, correct? He said yes, for sure.""   The new car sales manager Blane Castorena came to talk to me and asked if he could beat the deal my credit union gave me could they try to run my credit for a try.   I said, thank you but no, I did not want my credit pulled again and that I was comfortable staying with my bank.   When I went into financing and signed the documents, I asked for the sales document to give to my credit union, and the finance manager said oh, Blane Castorena told me that if I could beat you rate that you would finance, even though the salesperson disagreed and said that was not the case.  So long story short I went ahead and financed with their bank even though it completely irked me to do so. 
                  * Given the financing fiasco enumerated above, I tried to get insurance on my new car, but none of my finance paperwork shows a lean holder and the agreement to furnish insurance has the loss holder as none.  Had to call my poor sales guy back to chase down the information. 
                  * The car wasn't inspected and I need to go back to the dealership to complete.   

After all of this the finance manager felt really bad and gave me two free oil changes, I was okay and left mostly satisfied, given the not so pleasant experience mentioned above.  So much so that I was talking with a family friend, showing her the car and telling her the deal I got.   She wanted the same deal so I called my sales person back and asked if he could make that happen.  He said he could and we set up an appointment on Monday 11/25. 

I go with my friend to the dealership, and my salesperson said he had a doctors appointment and so he handed us off to another sales person.  Although this was okay, it was not ideal.   The new salesperson was great and we made it work.   I trying to work the same deal, all over again, because of the salesperson change.  All I wanted was the internet advertised price and the two discounts that she qualified for.   They came out with a different price and as you can imagine had questions, the salesperson didn't feel completely comfortable answering all of them, so he went and asked Blane Castorena to come out and explain, yes the same Blane Castorena that outright lied to the finance manager on my deal.   I put that aside and asked him for explanation of each of the numbers, which is within my rights.    He then turned to me and asked are you buying this?   I said no, that my friend was, but that she appointed me as her agent.  He then turned from me to her and said, I'm only going to deal with her because she is the one buying.   So he turned to her started grilling her, and she was panicking, I told him to talk with me and she told him the same.  He then became extremely rude, though back the chair and walked away, I said really?  You're going to treat a customer this way, you're not following your dealerships service credo, will I just need to talk to your manager.   He said ohh I'm so scared, and then when in his glass frame office and when in cover he called me an xxxxxxx!!!

At this point I was furious, I asked my salesmen for Blane's manger and he just grabbed another dude standing in the office, I'm pretty sure it was not the Blane's superior.  The tried to smooth it over, but my friend decided that she did not want to give them her business so we left.   

I'm within my 3-day purchase window and I'm seriously considering taking the car I bought back.  I bought the vehicle for my daughter and already presented it to her, that is the only reason I haven't taken it back, in fear of breaking her heart. 

I'm so very disappointed and when the dealership assessment comes back from Ford, this comment will go in it.   For the sake of future customer's I hope that something comes of this so that Blane Castorena becomes afraid to treat customers like he treated me.

If all else fails contact and attorney.   I'm in step two, I've contacted the finance company as the dealership said they would refund me and till this date has NOT.

22615,3,29-Jun-19,"I will have to warn to stay away from this dealership, they cannot be trusted to honor price agreements and will up prices at the last minute. Don't be afraid to walk off last minute on them and make false verbal agreements, they'd do the same to you.

Sales rep provided me a quote on a Tacoma which I agreed to and so I drove 40 minutes back to their dealership to make a purchase. I go in, confirmed the price verbally, test drive the vehicle then they sit me down to pull a credit check which I was comfortable with as I have near 800 credit. I sign the paper, they run my credit.

THEN they tell me there's a problem, that there's a mistake on the price. They need to charge me another $1500 + $800 for their security package. Normally I would just walk away at this point, but they made this a personal attack on my wellbeing when they made a hard pull on my credit before telling me they're changing the price on me. Not to mention the time it takes to get answers at a dealership.

I am not going to blame the sales representative since they can only do prices someone else approved. I am blaming AutoNation, a public company that can't take responsibility for its employees actions despite making a net profit of $400+ million a year.

I will also point out that I didn't like the tone of the manager, David, who said I signed the credit check approval papers when I pointed out they already did a credit pull on me. Well of course I signed it, I trusted in the previously agreed price and signed the bloody approval papers to buy the car at that price. Said they won't honor it unless it's on their paper with all prices written down. He then disappears and let's the sales rep do going back and forth again and I get to spend my time sitting there waiting. I budged a bit to add another $500 on the previous price but they were not going to do it.

Petty me is now here having to write bad reviews and will be warning people about them online for the next 2 years because that's how long a hard credit pull stays on my credit report.

11767,11,23-Jun-19,"I am a disgruntled potential customer that would like to share my experience today at your dealership. I hope this gets escalated so that it can be corrected. Today, my mom and I were in the market for an accord. After visiting Big Star and Clearlake, Clearlake gave me a great deal, everything was lined up, except one thing- they did not have the car in stock. They would have to do a trade, and it would be ready for pick up on Tuesday. So I decided to call your dealership for a quote and availability. Nick answered, said the car is in stock, gave me a solid deal: beat Clearlake by $100 and will match the special interest rate, pending credit. At the time, my mom was weary of visiting two dealerships so she did not want to visit a 3rd. So she did the online credit app, sent me in to iron out all the numbers, and went to work. If the numbers were good, she would come in to sign. 

When arrived, I was greeted by Nam Nguyen, friendly guy, who helped me. The deal was made. Then we went to finance. I was initially helped by Matt. After he did some crunching, he told me the interest rate would be over 5%. I questioned it, I was told that it would be 2.9% special rate, and my mom’s credit was over 800, it should qualify for it. He explained that with special pricing, I cannot receive special interest. I stated that’s not what I was quoted before I came in. He then stepped out of the office, and when he returned, he told me Javier will help me. Confused on why I’m being passed around. Javier asked me my age, and told me in order to buy the car, I have to be on the loan as well. I told him I do not want to be on the loan, my mom’s credit and income should be enough. He then advised me that since the car is for me, I have to be on the loan or else it’ll be considered a straw purchase, and that’s illegal. I questioned it, so how is it possible that parents buy cars for their kids to go to college, or when people buy cars as a gift. Father’s Day, Mother’s day, anniversary, Christmas, whatever the reason shall be. His reply, “only if they are under 18”. It still didn’t make sense but I responded, “I never heard of straw purchasing, I just learned something new. But regardless, I’m not under 18, and if I have to be on the loan, then it’s a deal breaker, I guess we won’t buy today” His reply, “if you don’t buy the car from us today, I will call all the banks and tell them you’re doing a straw purchase, blocking you from buying it somewhere else”. At that moment, I took it as a threat, strong arming me, forcing me to apply by his rules or else. Is that how Gillman treats their customers? Angry, I walked out his office. Of course he tried to stop me, and said he’s willing to make a deal. I was too angry to hear what “deal” he had to offer, so I left. We have purchased many cars throughout the years, but never once have we been treated this way. It’s very frustrating. If your dealership considers it a straw purchase and cannot sell, then so be it. But is threatening a customer apart of the process, is it necessary? I just want to share my experience, but I also hope someone can explain what just happened.

I never write reviews but after seeing all the great ones here I felt compelled to share my experience since I unfortunately had such a horrible one. 

I went in wanting to look at the xc90 but was open to look at other vehicles. I walked in and was greeted by the receptionist and was told that a salesman would be with me shortly. After 20 minutes, Daniel finally walks out and offers me no apology for waiting and instead of offering to show me cars he asks me to go to his office. I was confused but I followed and he immediately asks me to run a credit application. 

Now, I have purchased a car before and this was not how my experience with them went. So I was very disappointed that a dealership who is supposed to be so professional and warm and welcoming did not offer me the same as they apparently have many other customers. 

When I told Daniel that I wanted to wait on completing the credit application and wanted to look at the cars first, I could tell he was upset. He told me to look around and to let him know if I saw something I liked. I didn’t understand why I had to go look at the cars by myself. Isn’t the whole point of a having a salesman is to have them help you and show you the cars??

I walked out and had to use the rr so on my way back out, I overheard the finance manager and the general manager talking. He told him some really outrageous things about the customers they had there. The gm started laughing. I seriously couldn’t believe they were talking about their customers like that!!!

I picked a car from their sister dealership down the street, liked it driven around and was sold on the price that was advertised for. 
I was there with preapproved from JSC bank with pretty decent financial rate. Did not want to get financed from the Dealer due to my own bank’s great rates. But since my super nice sales accisites (James/Wolf) insisted that they may offer me better rate. So, why not. I was agree.
I sure was pleased with their hospitality and help they provided during my decision. 
Everything went well until I was taken to this finance department. Let me mention that I was the only customer in waiting area waiting for these guys to take me in and help me get out soon they can. 
It took about 30-35 min. Which is okay. 
But it wasn’t that easy and ok as much as I thought it would or can be. This fellow I dealt with name (Pleasant Abraham) started working on my case. He was taking his sweet time which is understandable. But no smile on his face must be the work load, I don’t know. 🤷???
We had 3,500.00 as a down payment. Once he was done running number around his screen. He straight up told us what our monthly payment will be. 
But I asked him what rate am I getting. He said 4.9% when I went there with 3.4% approved from JSC bank. Told him no we rather just get it done from our bank. He asked us if we have a paperwork to show him... after confirming everything he left the office and returned after while and goes back to his computer screen and gave us another monthly payment. 
My question remained the same what’s my % rate? He said he will match or beat by one point. 🤦???
But what’s the point getting same rate after spending almost 2 hrs For same %. I said it’s okay we will just keep the banks offer. But thank you. 
Oh, boy.. This guy pissed off or what!? I don’t know. He with a smirking face gave me a look and said.. What do you want me to do !? Give you a 0%? 
That was pretty rude of him. I got shocked and said oh you are not as plasenst. Are you !? 
He replied I try to be. I acknowledge him that he is being rude. He straight up told me if I am the one who will sign the paper work? Since I wanted the car to be under my little brothers name and I was paying down payment to help him out. So, I said sure he said no you are not you can leave. 
I really was pissed off at this point I told him look we really have to go.. please finish the paper work it’s already passed 9:15-20 and I have 5 years old baby to pick up from a baby sitter.

If you buy a used car from this business, which I highly recommend you do not, make sure to have a third party mechanic look it over. Do not listen to their sales staff about how the vehicle has gone through rigorous testing by certified staff. 

I am currently in the middle of purchasing a truck from them which is contingent upon Clay Cooley fixing issues my third party mechanic discovered, which their ""Top Notch"" mechanics had missed; as well as, repainting the truck. In fact, the truck wouldn't even pass inspection.

During this time of waiting for the repairs to take place, no one could give me any answers as to the status of the truck. Getting anyone to call you back is the most difficult process for this company. After leaving multiple messages with the sales staff, finance, and managers, I received a response one week after dropping the truck off. Now to mention again, the loan was not to go through to the bank until after the truck was fixed and I inspected it. 

They finance department had decided it was ok to send the loan through anyway. So this process is still an ongoing mess right now. The person in finance I am working with, Rahim, had me come in and resign some paperwork to extend the start date of the loan because the repairs were taking longer. 

In my haste, ignorance and misguided trust in the company, it was not until later when I received the loan note from the bank, that I noticed the price of the vehicle was increased by over 3k. Rahim assured me that the paperwork I had signed was just an extension for the date and not once did he tell me about the increase in price from the original loan. What they did was lower my interest rate and raise the loan amount so the monthly payments looked the same.

 Not a tactic I would expect in a company like Clay Cooley. I've tried to reach out to talk to Rahim and figure out why he tricked me into signing this deal, and while yes I should have read the many pages in detail, Rahim assured me it was the same deal, just a date push out. Also to reiterate, the loan was not supposed to be processed until I inspected the truck. 

I will update more details on how my loan was changed to an amount which was not after upon soon.",1,227,Texas_without_threshold\Chevrolet49 Reviews of Clay Cooley Chevrolet.csv
19128,4,12-Mar-19,"So here it goes….I bought a used 2015 Nissan Rogue SV in March 2018 from a salesman that was fair with me, but once I got home after financing, things were not as I and my wife were advised. I was told I was paying $436 a month at an 8% interest rate. This included $34.00 monthly for a “service package” which was paid directly to the dealer and not financed but was somehow included in my monthly payment. So I am paying $8,987.64 in interest on a $17,000 car. And got sold a $2,469.56 service package, for oil changes. 
Fast forward to January. I get an email telling me I am eligible for a upgrade with no down at a lower interest rate as a loyal customer. I go in and they tell me the payment for a 2019 Rogue Sport SV is $755 a month and NMAC has a program where the payment will go down in 4 months after 4 consecutive payments by $200-250 a month. 
I ask for proof and they tell me over the phone the NMAC representative in there in their office and location just for this. I can speak to him when I come in.
I come in and the finance guy Jade has a piece of scratch paper with $755 in a sharpie marker and a highlighter spot for me to sign. I said no way I refuse to sign as I told you until I get concrete details. 
He said ,”bye then”.
That’s my great customer service story (and I am leaving out the 2 consecutive days of 3+ hours I spent there waiting before leaving).
# days later me and my wife go to get her a new car and upgrade and she is notified her credit has been hit 7 times without her consent by this dealership running her credit. Her score was 7 points lower.
They never once asked for her consent or mine to use her. They kept asking for her information and I refused as I had no details.
Then today the sales agent (the only honest one there) told me they still wanted to work with me, and his boss asked to get me back. I told him I need proof of this program at NMAC and wanted to speak to the guy personally as I know its not true after calling NMAC and inquiring and they were appalled Clay Cooley would misrepresent themselves and illegally run my wife’s credit, and mine they ran 13 times. Why I have no idea except desperation to get me approved. 
This is just the beginning for me pursuing what is right. I will not rest until I am finally treated right, and they fix their wrongs. 
Do not buy from them without a lawyer or police officer, then you may have a fair shot.
I am personally fearful to take my car there for my over-priced service package as I feel retaliation.

And then because it was a truck it is harder to get financing for a truck so I went to an SUV, and I'm now I'm told they can Finance it with 1500 down as I went down in the cost of the vehicle another $5000. They do not call in down payment they call it a bank fee or get a cosigner so 0 down never happened unless you have wonderful credit and make $10,000 a month. I requested how to post a review on their website and was told they would have a manager call me they did not want me to post a review on their website.

8213,28,02-Mar-19,"I was working a purchase on a 2 year old vehicle. Price asked was fair and they weren't willing to negotiate, but as I said it was fair. I was presented an offer that included a $2K service contract and $1199 fee to buff out some paint imperfections and add 1 key fob, with an 6.9% APR(I'm preapproved for <4% at my credit union). This was a turn-off for me. I decided to just pay cash outright and the salesman informed me that I would need to pay a $1000 fee to do so, since they would be losing revenue from financing. I decided to bounce. Turned out well as I found a vehicle that was one yr newer and they gave me a 3.4% apr.

THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME I'M BUYING CAR. I WILL PAY MORE MONEY TO SOME OTHER DEALERSHIP, BUT NOT TO BURLESON HONDA!!!!  ( I KNOW THIS REVIEW IS LONG BUT IT WILL SAVE YOU TIME AND RESPECT) PLEASE READ THE REVIEW!!
In my dealings with multiple dealerships, this was the far most worst experience ever. My family has owned Honda for years and that's all my family drives. 
I went to buy a car from them and test drove couple of them. Finally made a choice and told them to bring the numbers. They offered the vehicle for $17995 and these guys bring me the numbers for $24,600. What is kind of deal is this. They hide hidden numbers, without asking me they added $3000 as a warranty on A CERTIFIED USED HONDA!!!! I walked out of the dealership, but Jose Fuentes, the sales manager, came running after us in the parking lot asking for our business. We agreed on the negotiated price. Now came time for finance. They would not agree on the finance rate. We told them we would do cash out buy and they agreed. During all this time they were taking soooooo long to do things, it was time for me to go to work. We agreed that we pay the down payment and come on Monday and finish the final document signing. 
Come Monday, the sales man came and asked me if I still wanted to finance? I thought they are my neighborhood dealership they should get business as well so I agreed to finance. Over the weekend they offered an interest rate, which was within our range. So I told them give me the same  interest rate, I will finance. Marcus McRae, the finance director, who should really apologize the way he behaved approached me and said flat out NO they will not offer the interest rate. This really upset me. I told them what happened to paper on which took my sign and they offered the deal on Saturday. He thought that i would not ask for it. I asked them to call Jose and he  comes and tells me, ""Oh that was just estimate deal"". Folks we are business operating family, when the deal is on the table its a solid when agreed upon. Because Jose Fuentes, on Saturday told me if I increase the down payment he would get me the interest rate, which I did and agreed to pay more down payment. My uncle was with me and he said we would pay the down payment through the company business card. On Saturday, they agreed to charge the credit card. But fast-forward Monday, we were made to sit around for an hour, THE SALES MAN, Allanzo, says he will assist to sign MY finance papers because all the other ""Finance Managers are busy on calls"". A sales man, where is the respect to the customer. After all the paper work is finished Allonzo tell me they cannot charge the card provided. They cannot charge $4000 on a company card because they got new GM and he changed the rules. What kind of business are these guys running. I told them I would give them my company check. I had to drive to 45 mins each way to and fro to get my company check because I did not have access to my personal check with me. I come back and give them the check, they tell me no we cant take the check after 45 mins. This really angered me. They are playing jokes with the customers. Folks, now this had become a very painstaking process. I told them will they charge my personal American Express which they did. Now when I asked Marcus McRae, why wasn’t there a finance manager signing my papers his excuse was that Allonzo is a finance manager in training, which for no reason he could answer any of my questions. I'm an educated person who knows how a person becomes finance manager, being in the business world for so long. Marcus went on to even say why I was starting something, when there is nothing, stating that a salesperson signing my finance document who is not a certified finance manager. Now why would anyone make any business deals with this place, which shows such disrespect and contempt to their customers?

17648,7,27-Feb-19,"Very disappointed with my experience with Texas Nissan Of Grapevine. My sales girl was wonderful, the rest of the experience, awful.  I was told on a price for my monthly payment and signed for what I believed was that price, however I was given all the wrong information, showed the wrong papers that I was signing, then used my electronic signature on the papers with the higher price as I was being read the apparent ""wrong"" contract with the price I was thought I was signing. The finance person that was helping me out was obviously checked out of their job because they told me that they had just put in their 2 weeks notice so obviously did not care to much with what was going on. When I went up to the dealership to try to correct the issue I was basically told there is nothing that they can do since technically I did sign the ""correct"" documents even though I was given completely different paperwork as I left there that day. They had no reason or excuse for giving me the wrong documents but just said there is nothing they can do. Not once did a manager come over to talk with me about the problem, I just had to deal with the finance people. I was told that because the finance person ""isn't the boss"" then they don't really have control over anything even if they give out the wrong information. The difference is only $8 but I do believe it is the principal of it all to correct a mistake that they had made. I had family that was going to go there when their lease is up but now they won’t be taking their business there.

But the guy said “if  bank don’t except it we don’t get paid”. So they told us to come back the next day but, we didn’t because my boyfriend got off work late so we went Saturday. Friday we discussed getting something cheaper so we financed a cheaper car. And was approved with documents to prove that we were. So that Saturday we got the new car and tried to take the Ford back but the finance guy (after about 10mins., pretty sure he was figuring out what to say) said, “you signed for it so it’s yours”! WE WERE NEVER APPROVED FOR THE CAR! We called the back we weren’t approved for and they said they sent the contract back, but Jorge Rodriguez said that we got a “Special Managers approval 😑! He lied! He’s been buying time or thinking we would leave it alone but not us. There’s xxxxxxxx and will take you for whatever your worth.

Wasted 6 hours only to find out that he was trying to sell my car on his own, apart from Clay Cooley and get me into a higher payment car. He even advised us not to pay our current payment on our car because it would be sold by them.  Now the only reason I found out was when I was doing my paperwork with finance there was never a mention of my car and they were trying to sell me the new car at a way higher price stating that both prices were in the contract just to realize it was never true. I wish there could be something done on the way they do business I wish nothing more than them to fail. They wanted me to sign this paper that they constructed to sell my car on auto trader or auction. Needless to say I canceled all paperwork and the contract with them they ended up giving me my keys but not one time apologized.

I was told I had gotten approved with a bank while test driving the vehicle and we were good to go, only to find out from the sales Manager Giovanni that I was DENIED but the bank hit them a 3k bank fee. Correct me if I am wrong, if I got denied or needed a NEW CO-SIGNER as he stated why would the bank want a fee ( a fee in which the dealership eats the cost of ). He stated that this was a fee I should be paying and because I wasn't putting a down payment down I needed a new co-signer. I have been approved with other dealerships and have also been told by other dealerships that a ""bank fee"" is a fee the dealerships cover and really shouldn't even be discussing this fee with customers. Not him though. I refuse to do business with anyone or any dealership that will continue to mislead their customers. Had he would had been upfront with everything it could have been a deal upfront.

12070,1,25-Nov-18,"This dealership was friendly and helpful at first.  I did NOT want the extended warranty, but the financial manager added it my contract anyway.  When I asked him to remove it, he said he did not NEED to redo the paperwork.  I could just remove the warranty after-the-fact by sending a cancellation order later and that my payments would go back to the original stated amount. But, afterwards - he told me a different story saying the Extended Warranty amount would be credited to the last few payments of the note.  I told him this wasn't acceptable, but he told me he could not change the contract.  I asked for verification that he did cancel the warranty.  He never gave it.  So I called the Extended Warranty office myself.  After 2 months, it turns out that it NEVER WAS cancelled.  I would have been paying for something I had not agreed to and didn't know I had.  I tried to contact the manager of the dealership and he never returned my numerous calls.  After I signed my contract with them, they were VERY uncooperative afterwards.  They knew I was short on time when I came in to purchase and needed to make this deal quickly. They took advantage of that and used it to cheat me.  They also entered my address incorrectly on the financial documents, so I didn't receive my first two statements and had to make my payments by phone.

I got there shortly after 12 and she wasn't there and had gone to lunch and I waited 45 minutes for her to return. When we started working the deal the price of the truck I was looking at went up 2,000 dollars than it was listed online for, it was explained to me that because I didn't have a current lease I lost 2,000 in rebates. They never took a dollar of their price of the truck I was interested in.  So I had them see what kind of interest rate I could get through them to find out my payments.  At that point I was told because I was a full time student that I couldn't be on the loan and my co-signer would be the only one on the loan. I told them I wouldn't buy the truck if I couldn't be on the loan, shockingly minutes later they called the bank and magically I was able to be on the loan with my co-signer.  While that was going on I called the General Manager at the Ford store that I used to sale cars from and asked him about this new law that supposedly was passed not allowing people with no income being able to be on the loan, he told me he had never heard of such a law existing.  I had asked for the keys to my personal vehicle back multiple times and they wouldn't give them back to me, and all I wanted to do was sit in my truck and charge my phone during my 5 hour wait time that accomplished nothing.

I didn't receive the buyers order until that afternoon well after banks had closed for the day.

22232,27,28-Oct-18,"FRAUD ALERT

THE FINANCE REP AHMAD RAHIMI IS A FRAUD. 

He literally LIED to my face. I'm so thankful I looked through the documents and figured it out.

Long story short:
Rahimi was our financing guy. The first thing my boyfriend asked him was to give us the payment amount that did not include any warranties or services. But he tried to keep convincing us to buy a warranty and we continuously kept denying adding warranties or services to our car. He gave us a number and claimed this is the monthly payment without ANY warranties or services. He then left the room and returned saying he would give us a warranty for only $10 more a month. Which was shocking since he dropped the price of the warranty by over 80%. My boyfriend asked him how that's possible and Rahimi said something along the lines of, ""I can do it. Don't worry about it"". We still declined the offer. He then leaves and returns a few minutes later and says, ""I'm going to throw in the MPP Silver Protection Plan for free for one year"". We say fine and sign the documents...

Turns out, the payment amount he claimed that didn't include any warranties actually did. The whole time the number he gave us already included the year-long ""free"" warranty. So I'm basically paying for the warranty...He LIED to our faces. He's a FRAUD. I cannot BELIEVE he lied to us. Pathetic.

They needed me to come in right away and sign the new contract. 
I had never heard of anything like that and after working hard all day, I went in to sign the new contract. When I got there they told me that I needed to pay another $530 bc the bank had taken that amount from them.

They pull the bait and switch with their internet sales prices. beware! then they try and add ""accessories"" to the sales price of the vehicle. 

then, not telling me what you will give me on my trade before knowing the payoff. remember, they are going to give you what they are going to give you, regardless of what you do or do not owe on your trade in. 

then finance is even shadier, adding points to the interest rate of the loan and trying to convince someone with an 850 credit score that 6% is Chryslers best rate. 

do your homework before coming here. do not pay for ""accessories"" and get your own financing if possible. 

also, be prepared to spend countless hours going back and forth on pricing. and pay attention to how they are structuring your deal!

19150,17,01-Sep-18,"Throughout the entire process, they threw almost every devious used car scam at us. For anyone who is thinking of buying from this dealer, I kindly listed them all below with our experiences.

1.	Hiding add-ons in the Agreement
After test driving the vehicle I called Capital One to tell them which vehicle we chose so we could get approximate figures. They gave us everything we needed, including advice on what to look out for from the dealers. Feeling good about the process they described to us we go back to pick up the vehicle that we test drove 2 days before.

Manny (Salesman), upon getting our finance from Capital One paperwork, leaves and comes back with a short agreement detailing the sale and asked us to sign. I look it over carefully and see $389 for tint. What is this I ask, he said that if for the tint. I tell him that I don’t want tint I’m fine with what’s already on the vehicle. After unsuccessfully trying to convince me about this add-on, I tell him no deal and tell my wife let’s go. At this point, he goes into the dealership and before we pull off, the sales manager comes out and apologizes. He says, he is losing money on the deal and that was an add-in to offset his loss. REALLY… I told him that I was only paying for what was advertised online which was on the dealer sticker, nothing more – nothing less.
He tells us if he can get the bank to take back their banking fees (whatever that means) he would do the deal. So the waiting game began.

2.	Internet Low-Balling
The sales manager was insisting he was losing money on the deal due to the online advertising guys. I didn’t care either way. I just wanted them to honor what they had advertised and what I drove over 40 miles (twice) to get.

3.	Changing Figures in the Lease Agreement/ Focusing on the payment
After sitting for close to an hour, Manny comes up apologizing again about the tint and says we took the tint off, now you can sign. He throws in, “and we got it at the price you wanted with the monthly payments you had before”. Now, I’m really looking at it closely; and I see it. What they had done was taken the APR which was 12% and jacked it up to 15.9% somehow giving me close to the monthly payment but making the deal more expensive. REALLY!!! 

I ask Manny how many more tactics they were going to try. I told him to stop playing games before I leave. He apologized (AGAIN) and went back to the “Little Den of Thieves”. At this point, I’m wondering if it’s even worth it. But the deal that they advertised (that they were trying to renege on) was a good deal. I figured they just wouldn’t blatantly go back on the deal especially after being caught doing all the above; so I played the waiting game.

4.	Flat Out changing the window sticker
The dealer sticker clearly had the 90 day 100% warranty checked. When they bring the sticker to us to sign, it had “As Is” checked. I tell Manny, “Are ya’ll kidding me!” He assures me this was the original sticker and I vehemently tell him that it wasn’t. We go to John who now really kicks on with the “Good Guy – Bad Guy” act, he tells me this cannot be. He tells Manny to go back to where they cleaned the car to see if he could find the other sticker. Manny comes back with it all crumpled up and says it was in the trash, again apologizing to us. At this point, I’m ready to go, but John says ok, let me make this right, so we can get your business. We wait longer

5.	Good Guy – Bad Guy & Bait and Switch
After almost 4 hours John the sales manager comes over and says this deal is costing me too much, we’re not going to do it. I will sell you another car but not this one for that price. (Bait and Switch) Really!!!
I jump up and tell me wife let’s go and we leave. As we’re driving off, I look over and see her crying. I asked what’s wrong. She asks “Was it a bad deal?” I told her it wasn’t a bad deal, but it wasn’t the deal they advertised; I did not come to get a bad deal or even a fair deal, I came because it was presented as a Great Deal. 

6.	Packed payments
I guess a fair deal is better than a disappointed wife. I turned around and end up buying the vehicle for my wife, without the warranty that they initially advertised. They convinced me into buying their warranty and gap insurance. I had to wipe my hands on my shirt from all the Vaseline that I got on it by shaking their hand to seal the deal. I end up dropping the extended warranty and gap a week later after discovering how much I would end up paying them for the life of the loan. 

7.	Delay Tactics
Frustrated by a buying experience that was touted by their website as being “hassle-free”, “comfortable”, and with “no-pressure”, we ended up staying over 5 hours.

8.	Multiple Unauthorized pulls on Credit
We came in with APPROVED financing and told them, on more than one occasion, “Do not shop us to other finance companies”. 2 WEEKS AFTER PURCHASE WE GET MULTIPLE “WE’RE UNABLE TO APPROVE YOUR CREDIT APPLICATION LETTERS” FROM LENDERS. They did it anyway. Of course, our credit score has taken the hits. If you have read this far RUN FROM THESE GUYS!!!

5199,13,23-Aug-18,"I have never in my life had a car buying experience like this one. It was my only day off this week and I wound up spending over 5 hours at this dealership. No one seemed to know what they were doing and they seemed to be short staffed. I went in with the intention of buying a Jeep and was talked into leasing one instead (with all the reasons it would be better for me in my situation). In looking back, I am sure the salesperson makes more money on leasing than purchasing. 5 hours later I drove out with a new Jeep Wrangler after trading in my Hyundai Sonata 2.0 Turbo. When I got home, I realized that the odometer statement I signed had false information on it. They had me sign that there were only 25 miles on the vehicle when in fact it was closer to 125. I called the dealership repeatedly to get this rectified and left no less than 6 messages on various voicemails. I never once received a return call. I guess once they had your money and a sale, you didn't exist anymore. Almost a month later when I still had no finance company information or a payment booklet to make my auto loan payment, I started calling the dealership again and still could not get my salesperson (Alan Garcia) or the Sales Manager (Jet) to return my calls. It took me threatening to come in and make a huge scene in their showroom to get a return call from someone. Once they looked into it, they realized my loan had never funded because the finance person did not do the paperwork correctly and did not collect the first month's lease payment. They would have figured that out if they bothered to return any of my many calls. They never paid off my trade in vehicle and so I was getting nasty messages from the bank that my payments were overdue and I was in default of my loan. I demanded my vehicle back as I wanted no further dealings with this dealership and they told me my car had been wholesaled. That was a lie. They sold my car to another unsuspecting consumer. How can you sell a car you didn't pay off and don't have the title to??? They had to call that buyer and have them bring my car back to the dealership and that buyer was sad because she loved my trade. You can't make this stuff up!!! There is a new GM and a new Sales Manager at this dealership that tried to make the situation right (they weren't at the dealership when I bought) and they claim they are working to fix things. They have a lot of work to do! I have since purchased a new Jeep from a great dealership in Bastrop. ",1,346,Texas_without_threshold\Chrysler76 Reviews of South Point Dodge Chrysler Jeep Ram.csv
22644,12,22-Aug-18,"Having purchased from Mike Shaw Toyota in the past we were surprised to have this experience.  
They had the 4Runner in the exact colors I had been hoping for and ultimately, we were able to negotiate what we considered was a fair price.  On a different note; they did let us join in their lunch during our long wait to finalize our purchase.  Thank you so much for that.  
This dealership now appears to be just like any other; more about money and less about the customers.  If you decide to purchase then plan on at least a 4 hour process...this with having excellent credit and gave a substantial down payment.
However, their offer for our trade-in was very low-ball.  The salesman misrepresented the presence of  paint protection film on the front of the vehicle.  We have verified that it is not there.  They wanted to charge us for the wire harness running to the hitch; even though it was already installed.  The salesman did not discuss the difference of getting the advertised 2.9% interest rate or getting the listed ""Keep It Wild"" $1000 discount for the vehicle.
Then it was on to Finance and the real smoke an mirrors show.  It started with having to choose between the advertised 2.9% interest rate or getting the listed ""Keep It Wild"" $1000 discount for the vehicle.  We were never shown the difference in payments between the two choices; just the final payment keeping the $1000 and an interest rate of 4.25% and it's payment.  We were never actually shown the total costs for the Extended Warranty/Service plans and that discussion was extremely confusing.  All we were shown was the change to our payments. Was that the intent ?  They tried to charge us again for the ""Vehicle Protection Package"" listed on the sticker and it does not appear to actually have been changed on the final paperwork after we had asked about it.  We were given a tube of what appears to be paint cleaner/wax for the Vehicle Protection Plan that recommends application twice a year.  The tube appears to maybe work for one application.  This ""Package"" was never really discussed with us.  We are wondering if the exterior/interior protection was really applied.  The package we received from Lexus included much more than a tube of car wax !

He told me that my monthly was a little higher because of the finance rate that I qualified for, and that I got a warranty for free because I worked at Toyota Corporate. All turned out to be a lie he used to leach commission from me.

Some time later I checked my loan amount and it was about $2,000 higher than I remember the value of the car. I went back and they told me it was because I signed up for the warranty, etc. Needless to say, I was extremely upset. They even produced a document where I had signed off on the lower rate and then the document where I signed off on the higher rate. They're great at confusing their customers to increase their bottom line.

I spoke to the manager Tony Pan and he refunded the gap insurance after many months of back and forth, but refused to do anything about the extended warranty because I had used it (car was leaking pretty much right after I drove it off the lot, I was also encouraged to use my ""free warranty"" by the sleazebag finance manager that added it for me). Extended warranty itself cost me $1,700. 

The team dragged their feet over 2 months trying to ""help"" me but in the end, I'm stuck with what I, admittedly, signed off on. But beware of John Fulgoni, he is a lying xxxxxxx through and through, and denied everything. The managers refused to help me.

I called back to Tom Peacock on day 5 and spoke with Mike (Finance Dept) who told me that I needed to come back and re-sign some papers because the interest rate was too high. He had no idea I already knew it was too late and the time frame had expired.  I went back up there on 03/24/18, and was told by Mike that  I needed a trade in and/or let my co-signer be the only name on the contract. But that's not what was told to me in the beginning Mike... He tells me that I should just return the car because it was a bad deal and I should have never been able to drive off the lot. So I left there and immediately got approved for another car at a more professional dealership.  From that point on I called and emailed requesting them to come pick up the car and not even the General Manager (Mr. Garcia) ever responded or called me. Not until 03/30/18 did they come get the car. Let's not forget they promised the co-signer $500 for running the credit and being added to the vehicle. Needless, to say they are now claiming they can't pay it due to the deal being bad. BUT NEVER TOOK RESPONSIBILITY ON THE FACT IT IS THEIR FAULT DUE TO FALSIFYING THE CONTRACT!!!  They had a sale going on Altima's until 03/19 on which they did everything they could to get them off the lot. Before my co-signer left, Mike Zimmerman (Finance Manager) had the audacity to request a re-stocking fee and payment for the mileage on the vehicle. SERIOUSLY?????

4029,9,05-Mar-18,Very unprofessional service and very unorganized. The sales and finance department are all over the place. The day we did the signing of paperwork there had been a verbal agreement of down payment. In the next week or 2 the sales rep called saying they needed additional money towards down payment that it had not been paid in full. Come to find out the paperwork did not reflect what was previously agreed upon. Another issue was that in the weeks following the purchase of the vehicle they started requesting documents that was already supplied to them during signing of paperwork. They informed us that if they didn't have these they couldn't get funded for the vehicle which was a total contradiction of what sales rep had previously told us in a different conversation when he informed us that they had been funded already. Then as the weeks continued they informed us that they had to have us redo paperwork cause they sent it to wrong bank and haven't been funded for vehicle. They don't seem to know what they are doing. We have had vehicle for over a month and still don't have a payment agreement set up and have been trying to give the vehicle back due to all the confusion they have caused. All they have been doing is prolonging the situation and not communicating with us. We are lucky if they even return a phone call.

11389,10,30-Jan-18,"We went to this dealership to buy an Odyssey Touring. We did a test drive and finally got to the point of negotiating price. For the whole negotiation, we were talking about out of the door (OTD) price without any trade-in or anything. In addition, we never mentioned about how much we wanted to put down for down payment. We got the the OTD price of $43,000. Then we go to finance office. Everything went fine up until the point we signed the payment paper. We agreed to put down $10,000 as our down payment which means that we will finance $33,000. But NO, on the paper, the amount we needed to finance was $35,000. Turned out, from the beginning, they had put $2,000 as my down payment without my knowledge. Basically, their PRICE WAS $45,000, not $43,000 which I was led to believe. This came at a surprise to my salesman too because as I said, we negotiated the car’s price without any down payment in mind. Moreover, when presenting the finance paper to us, instead of showing, explaining, and checking everything on it (ex: interest rate, down payment, amount finance…), the finance guy just went straight up to the monthly amount and tell us to put initial on it, trying to rush through the paper. If we haven’t caught that, we would of buy that car for $45,000 and thinking it was only $43,000. The final straw that make me writing this is when the finance guy told me that that was never his fault, that $2,000 was on the paper from the beginning and I did not read it (my thought: even your staff did not see this, and you still had to courage to blame it on me????). I understand that dealerships need to make their money somewhere, either car price, finance, extended warranties, or accessories; which is totally acceptable; but what I cannot tolerate is when they are trying to SCAM their customers. Yes, I used the word “SCAM.” Their way of doing business is highly UNETHICAL. After reading my review and you still want to give this dealership a try, by all means, be my guess. At least, keeping my experience in mind and I hope you get a good deal from them. My final warning: EXTREMELY CAREFUL WITH THIS DEALERSHIP!!!!

So I paid my first payment on 18 December 2017 for a due date of 20 December 2017. I finally got the physical bill in the mail on 19 December and set my account. I waited a week to see if the payment I made posted but still nothing so I called Mike at Ingram Mazda to see what was going on and they kept on saying it must have gone through and that Mazda capital must have messed up. 3 weeks later in January, payment still hasn't gone through and now have a late fee on my account. I finally called the Sarah at accounting and was told that they mistaken the payment as a down payment instead of a first payment.

12215,8,15-Oct-17,"Before going into the details, I want to make clear that my experience with Onye, the sales rep, was very pleasant.  He was very nice and professional, and answered all of the questions about the automobile that I had.  I give him hands down 10 out of 10 as a sales rep.    Everything in my experience outside of Onye was extremely unprofessional and had me almost walk away from the purchase at several points along the way.  I went through USAA auto buying, which gave me a price for the specific vehicle that I was interested in.  When I went to the dealership, the first thing I did was show them my paperwork (with the price), and from there the sale continued (no mention of anything that would raise the price.)  I took a test drive of the vehicle, was pleased, and decided to purchase.  From this point, the whole experience deteriorated.  After keeping me waiting for periods of 15-20 minutes at a time, I was told that I was not military, so they'd have to add $500 to the price.  Another 20 minutes goes by, and they tell me that price only is valid if financed through Hyundai Financing (I already had all of the pre-approval paperwork ready to go to finance through my bank).  After straight-up asking if they could give me the car, at the price the the Auto Buying service quoted me, Onye told me ""no.""  I shook his hand, and walked out of the dealership.  I was very angry at their dishonest, bait-and-switch, business practices at this point.  Either sell me the car for the price agreed upon through the car-buying service, or don't have your internet manager publish that price to get me into the door.  Even if you can't sell me the vehicle for the Internet price, tell me this when I come in and show you the paperwork (before I test drive the car), that the price is inaccurate.    A couple of days later, I received a follow up email from an Internet rep named Cassidy, and I explained my frustrating visit to her.  She apologized, and told me that the manager would agree to sell me the car for the original price that my auto buying service quoted me.  When I asked her for the total price, including TT&L, dealer adds, and financing through MY bank, I was given a price of about $25,600.  I immediately noticed that in her price breakdown, she said that tax was $1925, a figure that represents a tax rate of 8.25%.  I immediately called her on the phone, and after pointing out that the tax rate is only 6.25%, she told me that she might have made a mistake, but that the manager is STILL firm on the bottom line price, but would only agree to any further negotiating if I came in to the dealership in person - and that evening only.    So, reluctantly, I went back to the dealership.  The manager never came out to speak with me.  I sat back down with Onye, who essentially insisted that I finance through Hyundai Motors, and that the rate would be 3.39% for a 72 month term (I SPECIFICALLY asked him ""for 72 months?"" to clarify, and he told me YES).  Since my bank was offering me 3.29%, and he was agreeing to knock off $250 more of the price, I begrudgingly agreed.  With my wife and 6 year old son waiting over 2 hours, I finally sat down with Alvin to ink out the deal.  I see in the paperwork 2 things that make my blood boil.  FIRST, the sales tax is $1,500 - NOT $1925.  When I called him on it, he basically just said this is the price, take it or leave it.  SECOND, the APR listed is 3.79%, not 3.39% that I was told by Onye.  When I called him on that, he told me that the 3.39% was for 60 months, and was rudely insinuating that he could go ahead and change my term to 60 months (after I have clearly established that I am seeking a 72 month term).  At this point, I'm exhausted, my family is exhausted.  We are hungry, and I just want to buy the xxxx car.  I sign the paperwork, and the car is delivered the next day.  As if my experience in the car buying process wasn't bad enough, a couple days later I get a call back from Alvin saying that I need to come in again and resign the paperwork (this, AFTER I have been driving it now for a day or two), and that my rate was going to actually be 3.99%.  When I told him ""NO,"" that if they're going to do that to me I'm just going to finance through my own bank, he told me that he would be adding $750 to the price of the car for doing so.  Over another $2/mo, I decided to just let another thing go (again, I already had been driving the car - I couldn't return it at this point?!?), and begrudgingly went back in to sign the final paperwork.  All in all, in the almost two weeks of driving it, I love the car.  I had a great experience with Onye.  But I will never be purchasing a vehicle again from such a dishonest dealership.  And even though I, nor any of my family and friends will ever be purchasing a vehicle from Hiley Hyundai of Burleson again in our lives, I hope by sharing my experience I can save a few more potential clients the heartache of dealing with such dishonest, bait-and-switch car dealership personnel, and advising them to take their car-buying needs elsewhere.",2.2,715,Texas_without_threshold\Hyundai21 Reviews of Hiley Hyundai.csv

It took me two trips to dealership and finally a phone call before a was even given a price.  After some negotiating we settled on price. I spoke with Sammy the finance director and informed him i just needed the paperwork to deliver to my bank. When I got there they would only honor the price if I did the financing through Ford or it would cost me 3000 more. I have never been lied to and disrespected so much from a dealership in my life. My family was realty looking forward to having a jeep for the beach house and after this experience I ended up not even buying one and just kept the extra money.,2.4,524,Texas_without_threshold\Ford29 Reviews of Friendly Ford of Crosby.csv
19170,37,10-Aug-17,"After reading several stories from this dealership and the horrible experiences a few customers had I know understand that the frustrations and issues I had with them were not isolated:
1. Finance Manager speaking down to you as if the customer does not understand numbers and pricing
2. Sales manager being sneaky and removing several warranties without my knowledge
3. removal of gap insurance
4. not honoring original contract and rate that they proposed to me and was never really told why it was rejected when I came back to finalize deal
5. inconsideration of my issues and once again finance manager advising me I can leave whenever I want with an Uber or Lyft because he would not request a service person to drive me to my job which is less than 15 miles from the dealership
6. not being contacted from GM- Mr. Osborne with correct info. He stated that he invited for a meeting to review my questions and concerns which he has not. no date or time was given. He also told me that my story is conflicting to what his managers and sales people are saying.  Funny part about this is that they stories that us as consumers/customers are all the same and relate.  
7. Not honoring original contract in regards to rate that they quoted me even though I already had pre-approval from Capital one.  Had me resign new contract with higher rate which was $1950 higher than original contract.  They did not work with me to resolve it. 
All they did was the shady practices in regards to removal or warranties and gap insurance.

33,20,02-Aug-17,"I called in about a car I saw on their website yesterday. I spoke with a rep who said his name was ""Taco"" Mendez. He seemed nice, as they always do at this stage.

He confirmed that the car was still available and I told him I had challenged credit and thus would not be making the trip to the dealership without a pre-approval. He repeated my request back to me, and I confirmed that I'd already done the financing app on the website. He asked me to send him a picture of my ID, which I did, then he said ""let me go to work for you and I'll be back in touch."" I supplemented my ID with several other identity and address-verifying documents via email. I also included my proof of income, bank statements, etc.

Heard from him after closing. He said ""we have a way to go"" on financing. I set an appointment for the next morning (today), but texted the salesman letting him know I had some questions before coming all the way to dealership. It's 30 miles from my house. I told him I needed a ballpark on financing terms before coming all the way to the dealership given its distance from my house. This information is something other dealerships have gladly provided so as not to waste either party's time. He says his finance manager won't contact any banks without me being there.

Let's just say they're unprofessional. Though I conceded that my credit was bad when I first called in, they thought they could leverage that into getting me into the dealership before discussing any terms. Which is ridiculous considering they've already dinged my credit with a hard inquiry! 

To paint the peacock, when I texted the rep that I was already on my way to a dealership much closer to my house, he (like a high school girl) responded, ""Ok good luck.""

I'm convinced the positive reviews on here are people that were paid or are family members of the sales reps. These guys are trash. Will stick to dealerships rated 4-stars and up on Google.",1.2,2,Texas_without_threshold\Acura182 Reviews of Hiley Acura.csv

So I find the exact vehicle I wanted at Auto Nation Nissan of Lewisville, we agreed on the price and I told them I had my pre approval and all they had to do is call the Capital One 800 number to get an authorization number. And said I DONT WANT MY CREDIT PULLED AGAIN BECAUSE I LIKED MY RATE CAPITAL ONE GAVE ME.

Well I should have known better, they pulled my credit without my authorization to try and offer me a better rate, now I have multiple inquiries on my credit report... Something I specifically didn't want.  If this is the way that Auto Nation, one of if not the largest car dealers in the nation operates then they are no better than 99.9% of the car dealers out there. This is why people usually have a bad taste in their mouths after dealing with dealerships and their finance departments.

So if anyone reads this, I would seriously consider going elsewhere. And if you are in the market for a Chevy or Ford, or a good used vehicle I would highly recommend Holiday Ford Chevrolet in Whitesboro Texas, I have bought most my work vehicles from them and they dont play these games.

I know credit inquiries fall off after 24 months and might not be a big deal to some but the issue here is the lied.

By the third time i went back to sign my paper work they finally admitted it had taken so long because they had fired their one and only Finance director and they basically wanted to start my deal all over and they hadnt even started the deal in the first place. It was poor quality bussiness they didnt know how to handle the situation and they repeatedly lied to me the customer on several occasions.

4719,29,20-Jul-17,"In summary: Worst car buying experience we've ever had. I've never worked so hard to give someone my money. Do not shop here. Tell your friends not to shop here. Spend your money elsewhere and safe yourself a lot of misery. 

In detail: This was a good experience until we committed to purchasing a vehicle and signing our names on paper. At that point, we were handed off from one person to another (working with a total of 5 different people!), with poor communication between the employees and multiple mistakes made. There was no disclosure of the total price, financing options, or APR until we explicitly asked for it and, even then they were not forthcoming with the information. Additionally, our initial APR offer from them was over 5% until we informed them that we would be financing through another company. At that point their APR offer quickly dropped to less than 3%. We stuck with our other financing options. 

By TX law, the dealership has to register the vehicle for you. We wanted to register the vehicle in our home state and transfer my old plates, as we're only in TX temporarily. We were told that we couldn't do that. A quick call to our home state DMV confirmed that, yes, actually we could and suddenly the problem was solved. The dealership also held onto the registration paper work for 3 WEEKS after everything was official, further delaying the registration process. They had initially told us the paper work would be mailed off the same week we received the vehicle. This is unacceptable. When I called to check the status of the registration, Michelle, the Title Clerk,  rudely interrogated me as to why we chose to register our vehicle in a state other than TX (she did not approve of our decision).... obviously mailing a stack of 10 papers instead of 5 is too much of a hassle, even for someone who has just spent over $40,000 with your company. This is an example of pathetic laziness and extremely poor customer service. 

We have continuously had to call and go back to the dealership to follow up on paperwork (I went back 3 times after we signed everything) and they always come up with an excuse as to why the job isn't finished yet. What it comes down to in the end is they only want your money and are not concerned with maintaining appropriate business integrity, honest disclosure with their customers, or good customer service relationships.

22878,21,18-Jul-17,"Some people get addicted to meth, some people get married to someone that they never actually loved, the biggest mistake of my youth? Trusting the sales team at Sport City Toyota. In the process of trading in a car they deliberately changed the deal we had agreed on, almost ruined my credit score, and falsified my information when they submitted it to the bank all under the guise of “trying to save me money”. If you’re looking on these websites because you’re deciding whether you should buy from Sport City Toyota or go to another place, I strongly urge you to seek other options because honestly going here has become one of the few regrets I have in life. If you’re curious about the entire story, keep on reading but be prepared…it’s going to be a long one so don’t continue if you have the attention span of a goldfish.

The day started off normal, I went to Sport City because I needed to get my car serviced and as I was sitting there I noticed one of the sales people (I’m omitting his name because the General Manager is the only person that truly needs to know who it is) was walking around talking to the people sitting in the waiting area to get a feel for their situations. He stopped and spoke to an older man that was sitting there about his vehicle, and I remember hearing him talk about the fact that the man had a lot of positive equity in his car and was trying to explain why that was a good thing. The man wasn’t completely interested, so the salesperson ended the conversation and attempted to find some greener pastures. I happened to be sitting there, and I’m generally a friendly person so when he engaged me I smiled and introduced myself. Then he said a sentence that will forever haunt me because it was the first lie in a string of lies that led me to the worst decision of my life, and that sentence was “I just want to save you some money”…of course the idea was appealing, and he seemed (I emphasize that word) like a genuine person, so I decided to take him up on that offer. 
We walked back to the sales area and started talking. We went back and forth about what I was looking for in a car, what was going on with my current lease, and after a bit he brought in another member of the sales team to take over. The new person and I continued the conversation, and we went out to look at some of the cars he was talking about. At this point I was completely uninterested because the deals he was offering were all laughably bad, and I made that fact clear to him. As the discussion started to fizzle out since it was clear that I wasn’t going to bite, the other sales person came back into the picture and asked what was wrong. I explained everything and he said “Oh, so it’s just the car” and then headed on back to whatever lair he would go to when he’d disappear. 
After waiting for a bit, the second sales person came back with a huge smile on his face saying that I would be happy with what they had for me. They had found a car that had just been returned that was only a year older but was a better model and had about 19k miles less than mine. This was night and day compared to the last deals they had brought, so I was intrigued and decided to pursue this one a bit further. This was a mistake. We discussed my terms, and I was very adamant about the fact that I didn’t want to make any kind of down payment on the car and that I wasn’t looking for any kind of huge increase in my payments. He understood. Around about this time, the original salesperson came back again and started talking about the rates they could offer. There was some jargon about how I had negative equity in my car, and I would have to take care of that which was okay with me. He then gave me the range of prices that they could get financed, and I told him that if he could get me the lowest number on the range without me having to do a down payment we would have a deal. He immediately shook my hand on that and had me sign a paper that showed that I agreed. He then mentioned the fact that in order to get this deal, I had (and he stressed the “had” part) to get approved for a Toyota Credit Card. I thought this was a bit strange, but I agreed because I figured there was no harm in getting a credit card, in fact it would help me since having more accounts actually helps raise your credit score (I tend to be a bit of a nerd when it comes to my credit). He scurried back to his lair and returned after a beat to let me know that I had been approved because I had (again I stress “had”) fantastic credit. We got back down to business signing some of the basic paperwork, and my curiosity got the best of me. I decided to ask him about the credit card and what my obligations were for it in regards to whether I had to spend money on it regularly or what. He said nothing. I continued to pry and indicated that I thought the portion of my negative equity would be put on the card which caused him and the other salesperson to laugh and deny that…but that’s all that was said about it. 
At this point we were pretty much on the path to closing the deal, so the second salesperson wanted to get another signature on a mock contract. As I looked over the contract I noticed that there was something incorrect on it (it was something basic like my name or phone number), so I let the guy know and he hurried to get it fixed. He came back with the corrected contract, but I noticed a new problem with this one…the deal we had made was changed to be 3 months longer and the payment was adjusted to be the highest side of the range of rates. I pointed this out and he looked surprised then ran back to check what happened. He came back and assured me that it was “just a typo” and that it wouldn’t affect the deal at all. This again seemed kind of sketchy to me, but I decided to take his word for it and signed it.
After this they handed me off to finance in order to complete the deal. I signed everything as it came to me until finally we got to the last signature and the finance person told me what I was going to pay…it was the deal that was “just a typo”…I mentioned the fact that this was incorrect and he stated that if we decreased the amount of months it would increase the payment amount. I didn’t know what to do since I had signed everything else, so I just signed the last line.
Fast forward to the next week, I received a call from the bank that provided me the loan but I missed it. The next day the finance department from Sport City called and stated that I would need to call the bank back and confirm the information that was submitted to them regarding my financial situation. The rep went over what was sent, and I came to a startling realization…the salesperson had sent false information to the bank. When asked about my job at the dealership, I told them my accurate wages and that I technically hadn’t started the job because I had just been hired; however, the information that the rep told me they gave to the bank was 20k more than I make and had me working for the place for 6 and a half years…which would mean that I started when I was 16. Now I don’t know if that’s standard practice, but I do know that if I knowingly submitted incorrect information to a loan provider it would be grounds for termination of the contract.
So with all of this happening, I figured things couldn’t possibly get any worse…then I got a letter from the Toyota credit card company. I opened it and literally felt my heart drop. The letter showed that I was responsible for a 4 thousand dollar charge on a 5 thousand dollar limit card. This was shocking for 2 reasons: 1. I was not told that this was going to happen, I can guarantee that I wouldn’t have gone through the deal if I had been told and 2. I don’t know if you’re aware of this but having a balance that’s that high will ruin your credit (personally, mine dropped over 40 points because of it). Now I’ve never been depressed before, but I’m pretty sure I know how it feels now. Nothing could bring me any amount of joy; music and singing are some of my greatest passions but for the next few days even my favorite songs failed to make me even smile. It was hands down the lowest point I’ve ever gotten to in my entire life because in that moment I realized that as a 23 year old I had increased my debt load by over 10 thousand dollars simply by being agreeable and trusting a person who claimed to have my best interest in mind.
As the days went by, my shock was replaced by disgust which then became indignation. I couldn’t believe that a person would go out of their way to cause another person to go further into debt and be so shady about it (especially since they’re supposed to be professionals). I decided that I would try to find a way out of this deal that had caused me so much heartache because everything about it was done in a gut churningly sketchy way. I reached out to a lawyer to see what could be done, and they stated that we may have something because of the credit card situation since they had never heard about that being done before. Unfortunately we weren’t able to pursue that route because *surprise* there was no paper proof that showed the sales rep said I had to get the card to get the deal (it’s almost like they had done it before and knew how to cover their tails). I should also note that in the process of talking to the lawyer, I found out that they had put the charge on the credit card and said it was a down payment…which if you recall was exactly what I said I didn’t want. The sketchiness was over 9 thousand at this point but now it was clear I wasn’t going to be able to get out of the deal, so I just resigned to the fact that this was going to be a new part of my life. However, I decided to make it my personal mission to do my best to make sure that this never happens to anyone else.
I got in contact with Sport City’s general manager and let him know what had happened and that I wasn’t telling him about all this because I wanted him to make it right, it was a bit too late for that. I explained that this was just me giving him the facts in order to hopefully help fix the problem with the sales reps. We then went through several phone calls where he tried to make things better by righting the wrongs because I think he even realized that the way this situation was handled was unacceptable. I will admit he was able to do a lot, he removed the charge from the credit card and lowered the payment slightly. However, the entire time it felt almost like I was pulling teeth. He would try to do the bare minimum to see if I would accept it then go a bit further once I didn’t respond with enthusiasm and when it came to the end he refused to give me the deal that I had initially wanted. So honestly now that I’m writing it out and thinking about it fully, he wasn’t even that interested in completely making things right…he just wanted to make sure they didn’t lose too much money while trying to calm a disgruntled customer. Which I guess is all we are to them…customers, not people. We’re just the things that they use to make sure they make their numbers and get paid at the end of the day…huh…well I’m going to wrap this up now because thinking about it too much still puts me in a bad mental space and apparently makes me see the true motive behind all their “kind” gestures.
I used to honestly believe that all people are inherently good and that if I was kind and treated others with respect, they would do the exact same thing to me. But after this whole ordeal, I now realize that I need to guard myself at all times because some people will try to take advantage of me when I’m not expecting it. Now in the long run I will take responsibility for the fact that I signed every document that they gave to me but again, it was just because I couldn’t fathom that people would be so untrustworthy and shady with how they treat other people. So congrats Sport City…you’ve successfully added another cynic to the world.
So for those of you that stuck with me this entire time, I appreciate and am slightly amazed by your attention span and hope this has helped you make your decision. For those of you that didn’t…well it doesn’t matter what I say, but I hope whatever cat video you clicked on to escape this made you giggle.
P.S. Another few small housekeeping things that they failed to take care of is the car was still dirty when they handed it over, they didn’t fill up the gas tank, and they didn’t give me a second key…these pale in comparison to all the other things, but I figure they should at least get an honorable mention.",1.6,1289,Texas_without_threshold\Toyota47 Reviews of John Eagle Sport City Toyota.csv
18437,12,14-Jul-17,"I purchased my used vehicle about 3 months ago. I was impressed with the facility and the perks they offer while visiting (drinks and such). I purposely waiting to write my review until I was able to look over all the paperwork away from the dealer and let the dust settle if you will. Here is what I learned from this particular dealer and purchase. Now some of this can be on me for not paying closer attention when dealing with finance manager however if you have bought a car then you know paper is flying when you get to the finance manager. So here are my thoughts.
1. Make sure you are dealing on final price not the monthly payment. They will sneak in things if you are dealing on monthly payment and not bottom line price. (example when I looked at my paperwork I was charged $895 more than what the vehicle was advertised on the internet. More on this in a bit.
2. Make sure if they over you a perk (warranty, service package, ect...) you get it on there ""WE OWE"" form. If you don't get this info on this form and ask for a copy before going to finance you will be charged for it (as I was) when you think the dealer is picking this up for you.
3. Do not buy GAP insurance through this dealer. They charged me $995 and I later found it priced at $395. They WILL triple charge you on GAP. Also pay attention to the rate they offer you if you finance through the dealership as well as it will be higher than what you can actually qualify for by getting your own financing. 
I was hit with all of this from this dealer and although you can go home and study what they burned you on and then go back and cancel within 30 days you still feel taken advantage of. When I returned to this dealer in person to cancel my extended warranty which I was told they were going to pay for (Pay attention to that ""WE OWE"" Form), and to cancel my service agreement which I never signed for but they stated was including with this purchase all i had to do was bring it to their dealership for service (oil changes, tire rotation ect...). I ended up canceling over 3K in warranties, service plan, and gap insurance. So back to the $850 charge that was added to my vehicles advertised priced. When I tried to recoup this or ask about it I was told this is a charge added to price on all used vehicles for reconditioning fee. Cleaning, balancing tires, ect... This is mainly for used cars as the new cars will have this shown on the sticker.  So this $895 I have yet to get back however I am not going to give up. So once again ask what the final price of this vehicle is before going to finance.

4914,24,09-Jul-17,"Earlier in the month of June I wrote a stellar review of the Sales Team of Frisco Dodge which I now must ""Retract in Warning"" due to the conclusion of a recently purchased factory ordered Challenger 392 vehicle on June 29th. Once my newly order vehicle came in and the financing stage took place all ethical honest salesman ship went to ""xxxx in a hand basket"". I requested 84 month financing approval before the delivery to estimate my down payment, I have another vehicle I need to purchase a Jeep Grand Cherokee for my college daughter next spring. I was told by one of their Sales Managers due to my credit score, which was over 700, that the best rate available to me from the lender was 4.66% a week before the car came in for delivery from the factory. I then suggested to him that I should personally seek out my own lending because I have had lower rates offered in the past 5 years with 3 previous New Dodge purchases without any question of my credit being an issue. However I was advised in the sincerest way, by that Sales Manager that ""only our dealership can get you the best rate possible because we do so much volume business with these lenders everyday and have a special business relationship with them, and going direct yourself will only end up with a higher rate than the one now offered and I would only be wasting my time"".

So being the ethical trusting business man and Decorated Veteran I am, I took him at his word as being truthful and did not give the rate he offered another thought. Then when the car came in from order and I got into the financing office with their Finance Manager he said the same thing but with a twist.... differently, my daughter a Psychology Major working toward her Masters degree at UT Southwestern caught his statement then, as being different than the one given just a week before when the Sales Manager had deterred me from seeking out my own financing in discussion about getting a lower available rate.  Pressed for time, I signed the paperwork and bought the car along with very unusual pressure to buy (3) different extended warranties, one that cost $1,820 needed due to what was described as the 3 complex computer systems in the Dodge 392 Challenger that may fail at sometime in the future, making me think why would Dodge design a defective vehicle that requires additional warranties within the first 7 years of ownership? But I purchased the warranties with his assurance that I could request a refund if I changed my mind.  Then after the weekend I bought the car I called ""The Mechanic Extended Warranty Company's"" service center and found it to be in Monterrey Mexico, where I was on hold for over 25 minutes just to speak to someone in customer service who said I did not have a warranty in the system! 

Now back to the financing issue, making any false statements of material known fact when dealing with money, or property is the very definition of FRAUD. The absolute best rate that both the Sales and Finance Manager said was available to me at 4.66% due to my credit, was a blatant lie. I called the Credit Union where they financed the vehicle after the weekend, just two business days after the purchase date and found out that if I applied through them directly with them looking at my credit application on file from the Frisco Dodge Dealer I would have received rate of 3.46% for 84 months with no application fees! That over the 84 months of the loan is a savings of over $3,000! 

I further found out that the dealer after getting the approval for me before the vehicle had arrived at the dealership, and rate announced to them from the Credit Union of the available 3.46% marked it up and sold the note back to the Credit Union for a fee plus to spread rate of the difference between the 3.46% and 4.66%, intentionally and falsely misinforming me not once, but several times, by two different Frisco Dodge Managers. Lesson leaned, I should have trusted my first instincts of taking the time to apply for my own financing when the rate of 4.66% sounded far to high for my income and credit score. But I am happy to say that once the Credit Union Management found about about the multiple misstatements and all the false communications provided to me by the Frisco Dodge Team regarding the financing in this transaction they stepped up for me and are now in the process of rewriting the note at the lower qualified rate of 3.46% for the 84 months. Thank you Credit Union for your ethical Customer Care!

That is not all, I have now for the entire week since taking possession of the new car sent seven (7) separate emails to their New Car Sales Director to cancel all three of the warranties purchased after finding out the one with The Mechanic Service Contract is customer serviced out of this country, and the others upon closer inspection and research are basically useless to me for what they covered or protected and still have no response from him on this matter. Warranties purchased at Auto Dealerships by law are refundable and cancel-able upon written request by the consumer, I have been told by both the Texas Attorney Generals Consumer Complaints Office and The Texas Motor Vehicle Enforcement Division in Austin, of which this morning I have filed complaints to both about this whole mess of a new car purchase from Frisco Dodge.

While the Service Department at Frisco Dodge has been great with my last vehicle purchase now one (1) year later, if it takes deceptive sales practices and direct lies to simple questions to purchase a vehicle I can no longer recommend this dealership to anyone..... ""Caveat Emptor"" (Latin phrase for, Let the Buyer Beware). I am certain that other Dodge dealerships in the Dallas / Ft Worth area have both ethical sales practices rather than thinking the consumer is stupid or uneducated and won't find out the truth, which inevitably always comes to light in business. Do your due diligence before you buy a Dodge, to find the dealer you can trust, I myself even if they now offered me a FREE vehicle after this experience to go back to Frisco Dodge would not even consider accepting it, for fear that something hidden and supposedly unknown to me would be wrong with the offer.

I purchased a 2017 Chevrolet equinox  07/06/2017 and the advertised sale price online was $19,800. When I got home, I realized the sale price on the contract said $22,800 which is $3000 above the Internet price. The next day I called the dealership and let them know why was the sale price change from $19,800 to $22,800 and they stated because there was a mandatory warranty that I had to purchase. I advised them that I didn't want that warranty and they told me it was mandatory or else they weren't going to be able to honor the Internet price. I let them know that they can't force me to purchase a warranty or service contract if I don't want to and they simply stated that it was too late I already agreed and signed the contract. I know it was my fault for not verifying the numbers on the contract but this dealership operates with deceptive practices in order to increase their profits and they hide everything from you and just make you sign really quick. By law warranties are free and service contract should be charged as a separate line item on the contract instead of increasing the sale price of the vehicle. I am in the process of filing a complaint with the OCCC, CFPB, and DMV to expose these illegal practices.",1,290,Texas_without_threshold\Chrysler214 Reviews of Gulfgate Dodge Chrysler Jeep Ram.csv

211,16,02-Jun-17,"I purchased a 2014 Acura MDX from them in March. Here are the issues I faced that you should consider and be aware of:

1) Do not purchase Acuracare from them. They quoted about $3000 and sold it to me for $1,900. The same evening I checked online and was able to easily get the same coverage for $1200.

2) The folks at financing are not truthful. It is one thing to make a profit and another to lie. They implied to me that a lender would provide me a better rate if I purchased Acuracare. That is not true. The dealership chooses to provide a better rate (that is already offered by the lender based on your credit) if you purchase Acuracare at an exorbitant rate from them.

3) The finance department is absolutely unresponsive if you decide to cancel any of the services. You can cancel Acuracare within 60 days and I cancelled it within 14 days. They take 6-8 weeks to process the cancellation in the first place. It has been more than 8 weeks and they are yet to process the refund and they do not respond to calls or emails.

4) Take a good mechanic along to purchase any used vehicle. I purchased a 2014 MDX and I found out (when the car was being inspected for our relocation) that it had had multiple paint jobs all around that was due to body damange and this was hidden by the dealership.

17464,0,09-May-17,"I have never been lied to or treated with such disrespect, it’s disgusting.

I wasn’t looking to purchase a new car until the end of the year because I still have to pay off my current car which I am giving to my mother as a gift. A salesperson that I met off the lot couldn’t wait and was trying to make something happen. 

The saleswoman was trying to run my credit way to soon before we even agreed on final numbers. After agreeing to the final numbers in writing and double checking, I finally agreed to give her my credit my info. She told to me to come pick up the car after work and to sign some more paperwork. When I arrived, they ADDED another $5,000.00 to the PRICE. When I told her that this was wrong, she tried to tell me that I didn’t understand or I was confused about the deal. After calling her out on that BS, she admitted that she misunderstood her GM Bob and that this was the new deal. She apologized but kept trying to close the deal with no hesitation. I was upset because I would have never given my credit information or pursue the vehicle for that price. It was a HARD inquiry on my credit, lowering my score 15-17 points and it was all for nothing.

The worst part was her Manager ROBERT BORDIERI tried to tell me I misunderstood and that running my credit would not affect my score at all. He told me that it’s only a soft inquiry that only stays on your credit for 2 and a half months... WOW! So either he lies so much with great ease or he’s an idiot who’s somehow became a manager at a car dealership. 

I called their corporate office and Debbie the assistant to the executives was very short with me and quick to put the blame on me on the 1st phone call. She didn’t even remember me on the 2nd phone call. I asked to speak or get the contact info for one of the executives and she would not give me anything. All she said is that they will call me in a day or two. It’s been two weeks since the last call... All I got was call from the GM Bob apologizing for the Manager’s incorrect comments about credit and how we could close a deal. 

All in all, this company and dealership have shown NO PROFESSIONALISM, NO CUSTOMER SERVICE, NO RESPONSIBILITY, NO INTEGRITY AND NO HONOR. What is sad is that they probably take advantage of so many folks who don’t know any better so they will just keep on going treating good people like nothing. So whether if you’re a 1st time buyer or it’s your 5th car, don’t go to GILLMAN. I shared my nightmare experience with a couple of friends and not to my surprise, they also had a bad experience at GILLMAN. 

I once worked in the car industry but now work in a different industry which also consist of sales and customer service so I know how people should be treated. With that being said, this place is HORRIFIC. ",1,1036,Texas_without_threshold\Mitsubishi12 Reviews of Gillman Mitsubishi San Antonio.csv
11553,7,27-Apr-17,"Everything went great for us until we got to the financing part. The finance guy, George, gave us a huge run around filled with nothing but half-truths and outright lies in an attempt to convince us that Honda's bumper to bumper warranty is somehow applicable only to the initial 12months or 12,000 miles of service, after which bumper to bumper is reduced down to manufacturer defect. In reality, the only thing covered in the vehicles initial 12 months that expires after that is wheel alignment. 

Every time we asked George a question about the extended warranty's cost, he refused to answer directly and goes back to monthly payments. When pressed, he told us that it would cost $600 after he fudges around with financing, which turned out to be on an 18% APR that he also refused to disclose. We could have financed it through a third party on our own for around 2%! 

Throughout the ordeal, George never gave us a clear answer on the total loan amount, the APR, or the extended warranty he was so desperately pushing on to us. Like clockwork, every time we asked him anything related to the actual terms of the loan, ranging from principal to APR, to cost with and without the supposedly miraculous extended warranty, George ALWAYS went back to monthly payment amount. When I asked him why he isn't answering our questions, he blamed US for misleading him into thinking that we care more about monthly payment, which is an outright lie since we repeatedly asked him for the net cost and terms of loan. He then said that 90% of customers care about payment rather than loan, which is completely irrelevant since we weren't asking ANY question about monthly payment.

Finally, when we got upset over his dishonesty, he threw his paper pad on the desk and wrote the loan amount with and without the warranty. Turns out, what he told us would've cost $600 is actually $1600. To add insult to injury, he then asked us to sign an affidavit that we turned down his offer for $1,100, which was again an outright lie. When I clarified this point, he had the audacity to ask us if we would do it for $1,100.

Totally unacceptable experience. Shady and aggressive sales tactics have moved from the stereotypical used car salesman to thieving finance salesman.

The salesman, Keith, was absolutely phenomenal and should serve as an exemplary employee. The finance guy, George, needs to start giving answers to questions he was asked rather than answers he wants to give to sell warranties. You are a finance guy. You facilitate the sale. Do your job. Give a straight answer, because our experience yesterday was in blatant violation of the Truth in Lending Act.",1.4,691,Texas_without_threshold\Honda44 Reviews of John Eagle Honda of Houston.csv

4857,28,02-Apr-17,"This dealership is by far the worst you will ever encounter which makes me so sad because it's in a small town that is growing fast and I promise you, word will get around! The manager at this joke of a place, Orlando, basically held my friend and her children hostage in a the dealership. The background story is this: 

My friend went to buy a truck and used her 2015 Dodge Journey as a trade in. She purchased the truck on the 29th of March and on a April 1st was called to come into the dealership and sign one last paper. When she went in, they tried to tell her that the loan that she agreed to and signed a contract on for 5% APR was denied and therefore she would need to sign a new contract with a much higher interest rate and higher payment. Naturally she refused and that is when all xxxx broke loose. The manager tried to use his size to intimidate her, yelled at her in front of her children, locked her in the dealership, told her he had every right to change the terms and she had no choice and refused to give her back her trade in which the bank verified was still under a loan in her name. Even just one of those things is appalling but add it all up (and trust me, there was much more) and this place is despicable!!  

She was then told that she couldn't take the new truck with her or they would report it stolen and she also couldn't leave it on the lot or they would have it impounded at her expense and since they refused to let her turn it in and take back her trade in, she was left without a vehicle for her and her 2 young children.

4290,25,02-Feb-17,"Unfortunately, there is no way to give ""negative"" stars. If possible, I would.

First, I found a price for a vehicle on the website that I really wanted. Called and talked with Eric, and told him I would come out in the evening to look at it. The vehicle was listed as ""brand new"". Once I arrived and met with Eric, he said that the vehicle was not here, that a manager had taken it home for the day. Even though it was not here (per Eric at that time), since I knew that was the one I wanted, I told him no need to take a test drive, just show me another vehicle on the lot that has the same features to look into. At that point, I wanted him to start running the numbers to get financing in process, as I didn't want to be there all night.
Miraculously, the vehicle was found, but the pricing was given and it was higher than the advertised price on the internet. Why post a sale price and not honor it? Well, it is because it has been ""sold"" to the service department to be used there, and then ""sold"" back to sales to sell me. The rebates that would come with a new model do not apply, since it is NOT technically a new vehicle.

After going back and forth, a deal was made and I drove out of the dealership with my dream vehicle. For (2) weeks exactly, I drove around and showed all of my friends and family about all of the cool features that this truck has.

Then, (14) days after making the purchase and signing the contract, I was called and asked to come into the dealership to discuss some paperwork. It was then told to me that after all, the bank that I signed the contract with decided that they are not going to honor it. I had to either give it back and drive home in my previous vehicle that I traded in, or sign a NEW contract with a massive increase on interest rate. YOU ARE READING THIS RIGHT. THE CONTRACT I SIGNED WAS NOT BEING HONORED BY THE FINANCE COMPANY AND DEALERSHIP AFTER (14) DAYS. Nothing changed in my credit, and nothing was shown to be inaccurate in my application. I have NEVER had a legal document that I signed given back to me and told that the SELLER is not going to honor it. If I just showed up after 2 weeks and said I do not like the terms and want to change it, they would laugh me out the door. I had to either surrender the vehicle IMMEDIATELY or pay MORE money.

I never thought signing a legally binding contract can just be denied, after 2 weeks, with no lies or wrong information listed.

The only recourse will be to let as many people as I can all over the world know that in Texas, a vehicle contract with AutoNation means NOTHING. There are NO words to describe the feeling that a contract means nothing. There is NO language in the contract stating that it is waiting for approval, but this dealership makes deals, signs contracts between customers and finance companies, without getting approvals. I thought problems like this might come from a used car dealership that could be shady, but not the dealer on a NEW vehicle. I have been lied to at every point of the process of buying a NEW vehicle. Wrong price listed, NOT new as stated, contract cancelled after (2) weeks, and either sign a NEW contract with higher terms, or take back your previously paid off trade in and act like the last (2) weeks never happened.

UPDATE: After contacting the general manager of the facility, they changed my contract again back to the original contract. I do not know how this happened in the first place, but the general manager, Nick, was beyond helpful and fixed the issue. I am confident that the financing individuals did what they did to me without his knowledge.

At the end of the day, my issued were resolved. Unfortunately, this should have never happened the way it did. Hopefully, they have taken the steps necessary to make sure moving forward this does not happen again to anyone else.",2,312,Texas_without_threshold\Chrysler38 Reviews of AutoNation Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram Katy.csv
18154,89,30-Jan-17,"6 months ago, I went into a Nissan dealership to “trade-in” my car for a new one. We went through the whole process, signed necessary paperwork left under the impression that I received a new car through a trade-in. Much to my surprise about a month later I began getting calls from the loan company stating that I was past due on my monthly payment. I was confused so I called the dealership and spoke to the financial manager who informed me that the car was not traded in and that he has no idea where the car was. I spoke to the floor manager and inquired as to what was going on, he informed me there was nothing he could do because I ""made a deal with the dealer so I would have to work things out with him"". After that conversation, I called Nissan’s corporate office who informed me that things would have to be worked out with the local dealership because they only handle ""manufacture problems"". Everyone I spoke to was dismissive as if this wasn’t a problem. Frustrated at this point I spoke with the initial salesman who says that him leasing the car until it is re-financed was always a part of the plan and never trading it in. Thinking I had no other option because I could not afford to pay for two cars I agreed to allow him to lease for a few months until ""the buyer's credit was high enough"". That never happened and then I find out that he was trying to lease the car to someone else but they aren't paying the payments and it is overdue by $1900. Long story short, I recently got the car back, after MUCH hassle, however, I will NEVER return to this dealership or any other Nissan dealership to purchase a vehicle from them. They didn’t even have the courtesy to investigate the case and speak with me about the situation. Not professional at all!",1,1066,Texas_without_threshold\Nissan170 Reviews of Central Houston Nissan.csv

I asked if they used ALLY, they said yes.  I told them to hit my credit once with Ally.  They hit it twice with another company also, causing my credit rating to go down. Bought car on Dec.2, still don't have license plates on Jan 15. Got payments within our budget but their methods are very high pressure & shady.

1354,0,08-Jan-17,"I am not one to leave a review, ever. After the entire process of trading a vehicle at this place, I had come to the conclusion, that car buying, and selling can leave the consumer very vulnerable. Long story short, I signed a contract on 10-10-16, and the finance guy didnt get the deal done untill days before Thanksgiving. I was told they were waiting on tax return documents to come back. After doing some research myself, that was in fact untrue. My trade-in had a loan at a local credit union, and the loan was showing to be late due to the pay off not being received for almost 2 months. I took a big hit on my credit score with the payment not being made. Then, the icing on the cake was getting a call from the finance manager (Mr Herrera) that I needed to come in and sign a new contract, because the original numbers wouldnt work with the bank, and this time around I needed 1000.00 down to complete the deal. I said no, I just want my trade back and want to be done with this place. He screamed at me over the phone that they didnt need my money, and went on and on about how they lost so much money on my deal. Which he then later called and apologized for his behavior on the phone, Im guessing someone heard him yelling at me. Once again, not my problem, I just wanted my truck back. I went back up there the following day after work, (mind you, its quite a drive) with my small children to resign the paperwork. Not one apology, not one sorry for the inconvenience, but rather a confused almost rude finance guy. He was in a hurry to get me out of there. Finally after almost 2 months of driving a vehicle I wasnt even sure that I owned,  I was done with this place.  I wasnt someone going in with a bad credit score, or needed a last resort, I was shopping here because I had heard great things, so I went. It was a nightmare, and did I mention I went through this process 9 months pregnant? Needless to say I wont recommend any of my clients/friends, I cant imagine anyone having to go through that nonsense. On the flip-side, Khan was super nice, and not his fault the finance department was horrible.",2,89,Texas_without_threshold\Buick3 Reviews of Port Lavaca Chevy Buick GMC.csv
5440,32,08-Jan-17,"Grapevine Chrysler Jeep Dodge - Absolute crooks!  

I spent 3 hours negotiating a deal. After endless back and forth, we finally agreed on a deal which was $7,000 better than what they originally offered.  As we were going through that process, they tried to tell me I was saving $3,000 because I was only paying taxes on the difference between trade truck and new truck and not the full purchase price of the new one. Saving me money?  That is Texas state law. 

To put their stupidity into perspective, they understood that I was a 20 year banker (With experience in auto lending), I've purchased 4 $70,000 + vehicles in the last year and probably 30 over all. I'm not a novice. I mostly negotiate deals by phone and spend no more than 45 minutes at a dealer. 

Following that, it took more than an hour to get to finance and close the deal. The F/I manager was a decent guy, but initially tried to sell me a rate that was far more than a rate for which I qualify - almost 2% higher than what I'm currently paying. I had some back and forth with him and we got to the same rate I'm paying.  This had more to do with misinformation provided by the sales team than him. 

Next, we start reviewing the calculations. They apparently charge you $900 to walk from the showroom to the finance office.  The purchase price increased by $900 from what we agreed to which was also the price advertised on their website and cars.com. The additional charge was ""dealer adds"", one of which was a bed liner which the truck did not have. They could not tell me what ""adds"" were added and this wasn't disclosed to me until I was close to signing the note.  The Sales Manager came into the office to try to convince me that the dealer adds had value (again - adds that they couldn't itemize) and also to find discounts offered by the manufacturer  that they could apply to the inflated price to get me the price THEY ADVERTISED WITH NO DISCLAIMER!!!  

At this point, it was a matter of principle. I told him I wasn't paying 1 cent more than their advertised price and asked him to give me a yes or no answer if he was going to do the deal. He said no and I promptly left. 

These guys are incredibly dishonest and try to squeeze you for every dime. You must be a very shrewd negotiator, experienced buyer and disciplined to stand a chance of not getting screwed. Basically, it is like going back to the 80s and trying to buy a vehicle. Do yourself a big favor and steer clear of Grapevine Chrysler Jeep Dodge.  Make the trip to Bonham or Roger Williams in Weatherford.  Those guys will shoot straight with you.",1,355,Texas_without_threshold\Chrysler91 Reviews of Grapevine Dodge Chrysler Jeep.csv

Their finance reps rip you off in general We bought a brand new car with signed price proposal but when we went for the final paperwork, they charged a different price and added up all kinds of unnecessary options and access to jack up their financial greed. When we checked the car invoice and visited them, we were told that the signed price proposal has been shredded and they were unbelievably indecent. Their General Manager  was never available despite our numerous visits to their dealership.",1,886,Texas_without_threshold\Kia30 Reviews of Central Kia of Plano.csv
