1410,06-Jun-20,"***My Buick came back to me in worse condition than it came in, and the technicians was never able to find out how to fix my parking brake service light or anything at all!!!! How is this a BUICK dealership that doesn't know how to fix a BUICK CORRECTLY??? ITS A SHAME THIS BUSINESS REPRESENTS BUICK AT ALL! Yes I got a refund, because nobody was able to fix anything!!!! 

***A correct diagnostics to fully fix the customers vehicle from the beginning would of been ideal! Having the technicians ""play a guessing game for services"" with customers vehicles and finances is wrong and unacceptable! Also having the wrong parts or saying it General Motors sending faulty parts is something you'll as a business reach out to GM about. Its bad for business and most customers only see that your services department are not organized and you'll not doing a good job with diagnostics completely. 

***My BUICK VERANO seems like services and technicians just ""dissected it and returned it to me with no respect or integrity"" for your customer. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I AM DRIVING, its not the same vehicle I brought in, and I used credit card and waiting on my refund so I can possible find a legit place to get the correct diagnostics and my Buick fixed properly! How am I supposed to trust driving this car now, with my family and travel with the military? My credit card refund has not returned yet and hopefully it comes back to my bank asap, because I need to fix my Buick Verano. 

Mike Smith was the only one helpful this week assisting the refund process and updates with my BUICK VERANO. I appreciate the assistance from a Fixed Operation Director, but why doesn't your service advisors and technicians work on a more professional manner?? 

You'll really lost a customers trust and me being military and from Texas (San Antonio) I was hoping for you'll to earn my business, because Soldiers always end up back in Fort Hood, TX and need quality automotive services. It's just not gonna be Patriot Buick/GMC for me anymore! I pray you fix your services department and business.
God Bless!

5409,22-May-20,"Today I had the worst experience in all of my car purchasing history. My husband and I were shopping for a particular truck and heard that Grapevine Dodge would be the place to find it. And we actually found the truck that we were shopping for however the treatment we received was extremely humiliating. Our salesman Leo sat with us to talk about the purchase and we explained to him that we would like to work on the pricing before any further actions could take place. He then handed my husband his IPAD and asked that he complete all of the boxes in red. Listed on the IPAD was a box that required his social security number. We asked Leo, if we provide the number would there be any type of credit pulled and he said no this information would be placed in the dealership files for future transactions. After completing the fields, we again stated that we absolutely did not want the credit pulled and he said they would not pull credit. Trusting what he stated was the truth we then proceeded to complete the requested information. After completion he took the IPAD went into another office and came back with my husbandâ€™s credit score written on a sheet of paper. We were puzzled as to how he had obtained this information without pulling my husbandâ€™s credit, we looked at him and said we both stated to you several times that we did not want the credit pulled. He began to explain that it was a soft inquiry and not a hard one therefore it would not show up on the credit report. In efforts to verify what he stated was true we immediately looked at the credit report and there it was, a hard inquiry from Grapevine Dodge. We said to him again, we told you that we did not want this to happen. He then proceeded to talk about the sale as if he didn't hear what we said about the credit being pulled without our permission. While talking about the purchase, still bothered by the lie he told, we explained to him that we would be seeking outside financing and he stated the dealership did not allow outside financing. We asked if we could bring the full amount of the purchase basically in cashier's check or check and he said no to that as well. It was at that point that we realized this dealership did not want to transact business with us. In this case it was apparent that this dealership had a problem with us. Their actions and treatment towards us would suggest that the issue was racially motivated. I have never felt so humiliated, frustrated and just down right disgusted. This dealership has a salesman that will look right into your eyes lie and manipulate in efforts to try and deceive you to get your information only to turn you away. Once we confronted him about his actions he asked to wait while he went to get his manager, Richard, who initially supported his actions until we informed him that Leo purposely deceived us. He then decided he would try to somewhat smooth things over by saying the dealership would do business with us. By this time, we were furious and felt as if we could not trust anyone. I asked Richard for the name of the owner and he proceeded to tell us that he was the one in charge and there was no one higher than him. If he isn't the owner wouldn't there be someone over him? Perhaps another lie! DO NOT USE THIS DEALERSHIP!",1,355,Texas_without_threshold\Chrysler91 Reviews of Grapevine Dodge Chrysler Jeep.csv

17078,20-Mar-20,"If I could leave a zero star review, I would.  We purchased a 2019 GLS-450  in December of 2018.  While Dutch, the salesman was fine, the dealer rating is dragged down by the absolute worst experience in finance department.  The Finance person, Tariq, was absolutely condescending and extremely high-pressure, especially when he found out we weren't going buy the ""Platinum"" package that ""every S-Class purchaser must have.""  

Fast forward to December 2019 and the introduction of the 2020 GLS-450 with second row Captain's Chairs and a touch screen infotainment display.  We made the decision to trade in our 2019 for the 2020 because it works better for our situation.

Because of the awful experience at Houston North, we drove out of our way to Mercedes of The Woodlands to trade-in and purchase the new GLS.  The difference in the process was amazing and I can see the difference in a locally-owned dealership and one owned by AutoNation.

Because we had purchased an extended warranty and prepaid maintenance for the 2019, we are due a 100% refund on these products as we never did use them.  Unfortunately Mercedes requires the selling dealership to process the paperwork.  

We have been trying for over a month to get this paperwork processed as Mercedes owes us quite a bit of money.  We have provided all of the necessary paperwork to process the refund.  All calls and emails to the Finance Manager, Frank Castenada, go unanswered.  The times I have gone to the dealership in person, there was ""no finance person available to assist you.""

I have also reached out to the Assistant General Manager as the General Manager, Ivan ""was not available.""  The AGM has not responded to us, either.  I am amazed that someone would do business in this manner.

8189,14-Dec-19,"Short version...I went in to make a deal on a 2019 Hyundai Santa Fe but could not come to an agreement with Garry, mainly because of the $500 Kahu tracking device they supposedly already put on the car (even though they just received the car and it hadn't even been detailed or service) and could not remove. He said it adds value to the car and insurance companies will give discounts for having it. Well I asked my insurance broker and he said most insurance companies do NOT give a discount. My daughter does not need to spend $500 for something that is worthless to her but apparently Grapevine Ford forces on you, period. After spending an hour there Garry said he could come off the price of the car $500 and reduce the cost of the Kahu theft recovery system to $251 and then told me that he couldn't take my deposit money to hold the car anyway, until my daughter got in town. I told them in the beginning that this I was helping my daughter find a car and she wouldn't be in town for another week. Why did he waste an hour of my life if he already knew this! Then a couple of days later Dustin calls me (the original sales manager who wasn't working when I went back the second day to put money down) and asked what he could do to earn my business. I told him all I was asking was to come down $500 (off a $27,500 car by the way) and remove the $500 Kahu system. He told me he would see what he could do and call me back. Well it's been 4 days and he never called back. My daughter will be in town tomorrow to purchase her ""new"" car so we're headed to Austin to purchase basically the same car with a few thousand more miles for $1,300 less. Oh and with no dealer add-ons forced on us!
I would recommend not wasting your time at this dealership, they play the typical games of ""used car salesman"". There were multiple other hardline ""sales tricks"" they tried using but I don't want to write a book.

9710,09-Dec-19,"I donâ€™t want to give them one star.   I am actually stunned by the treatment I received. I have a 2018 Ford Escape.  I had the engine replaced when it had only 11,000 due to a warranty covered issue.  I was out of my car for 30 days.   At 21,686 miles the check engine light came on again and I tried to get my car in to be looked at.      The manager Hawk knows me by sight.  However the tech assigned to my car was joe.  Joe pulled the code and it was the exact same code it pulled with the first engine change.  Which almost always means the same issue is going on.  He proceeded to tell me that it code be rodent damage and that they wouldnâ€™t be able to look at it until the next week and that I would have to get a rental.  They told me there would be a deposit and taxes due. I told them that they are obligated to put me in a loaner because itâ€™s most likely a covered warranty issue. (Due to history) also itâ€™s a  known issue  and rodents do not go near the cylinders.  And that particular code is never related to rodent damage.  I asked them to please cover the rental, but they said no.  They could refund me the deposit and the taxes,  or the rental place would refund it. (I have never ever been refunded for rental deposits-and I put gas in the car and I donâ€™t leave trash in the car.)  After speaking with another â€œmanagerâ€ on the phone after I left the dealership because I was upset and decided I would wait another day or two.  I spoke with another dealership and they told me they would take my car and put me in a rental with a 50 deposit and no taxes.  I went ahead and called this dealership back because normally I get better treatment and I try to stay loyal.  I was told that their would be a deposit only.  But they never said how much.  When I went in to drop my car off they told me it would be 200$ deposit.  And the person proceeded to tell me that he told me the amount on the phone.  I never would have agreed to come in for that amount.  I want everyone to know that this dealership is full of thieves and liars.  And I will never ever visit Frisco autonation again.

Check received on today, thanks to Mr. Huck Hibberd, the general manager.  When he realized on yesterday 09/23/2019 that we hadnâ€™t received the refund on Saturday, he had it sent to us via overnight FedEx.  It was delivered around 9:30 this morning 09/24/2019.  We appreciate you Mr. Hibberd. BMW of Dallas need more people like you who take customer service seriously and keep their word. Unfortunately 5 stars because of Mr. Hibberd plus 1 star for previous experience equals 6 divided by 2 is 3 stars average.

They only treat you well when it benefits them. 65 days and no refund.  Would you let me drive your car off the lot and keep it for 65 days before buying it? No? Then why should we have to wait for our money?

My husband and I bought a BMW from them, but decided to trade it in. When we were thinking about purchasing and up until the deal was done, they were to eager to help. We were getting calls the week before. We got to the dealership late, but they stayed open for us to close the deal. They even took care of some things on the car for us the next morning.  We thought it was a great experience. 

So when we traded the vehicle and received our paid in full letter from the bank, we sent all of the proper and correct documentation to BMW of Dallas to receive a refund for the tire and wheel contract.  This was done via email and sent to the finance director.  Almost eight weeks later, we call to check on the status of the refund. Well, it took about a week and a half to finally talk to someone in finance. The original person we spoke with was transitioning to another department; therefore we had to start over. Guess who we end up communicating with?  Yep, the finance director and he acted like he didnâ€™t know what the status was and was going to find out.  He even made comments like â€œWe donâ€™t want your money.â€  Well, why did you sleep on our paperwork all of this time?

Okay, so he has someone to send us another document (the last document)to sign and saying this will get the refund processed. Document gets signed and sent back to the finance director and the person who sent the document.  Okay, 7 days later, I email the person to check the status of the refund. Iâ€™m thinking at this point it should have been expedited because they dropped the ball.  Well finance director emails that night and states â€œweâ€™ve done everything on our end. The refund usually takes 60 days.â€

So basically, we had to suffer because they messed up and didnâ€™t feel it was urgent enough to be escalated or expedited.  After going back and forth on several emails with finance director and even sending one to the general manager, finance director says corporate has received our concerns and get a check out next week. 

We donâ€™t care how it works normally, because this is not a normal situation. We didnâ€™t purchase a vehicle from corporate and the 60 days were up last Monday, September 16th.  This is not the first time we have traded a vehicle and received a refund. Dealerships are able to cut the check on their level if necessary. Apparently this isnâ€™t necessary enough to do that. 

Finance director says he is accepting accountability and once he gets the check in his hands, he will get me a Fedex tracking number.  He never once apologized about this until I threatened to post a bad review which we donâ€™t usually do.  He basically said if I feel Ike I have to do that, then go ahead. 

So until we get our refund in our hands, Iâ€™m posting this review daily. ",1.7,38,Texas_without_threshold\BMW40 Reviews of BMW of Dallas.csv
4167,26-Aug-19,"First, Iâ€™d like to start by saying our salesman, Jose, in used cars was great. My husband and I purchased a used vehicle from Autonation Dodge 8/17/2019. The car was at another dealership and they needed to go get it. Totally understandable as AutoNation has hundreds of cars across many locations in DFW. We are in the used car sales department when the vehicle gets back and my husband goes outside to check it out. MANY very noticeable damages that were never disclosed to us via the sales person (as he did not know because it was at a different location) nor the listing description on the website and the car was FILTHY. We agree to take care of the damages ourselves in order to hurry the process along and get out of there as we had been there for roughly 5+ hours at the time and one of the sales managers tells us he will lower our payment if we agree to handle it on our own, not to mention I loved the vehicle, damage and all. They provide a quick outside clean of the vehicle and a quick â€œwipe downâ€ of the inside and tell me to bring it back for a FULL detail. 

We finally make it to the finance office about 7:30pm and the gentleman shows us the final paperwork (payment not lowered as mentioned by the previous manager) .. We discuss with him what we were told and he fixes that issue. We then tell him that our sales guy as well as another manager had told us we could do a deferred down payment for 28 days if we leave a check with them which was a HUGE blessing to us. He says â€œyep we can definitely do that we just run the check through a system that verifies that it is attached to a real accountâ€ .. Okay great. He proceeds to â€œverifyâ€ the check and then says â€œoops, I almost processed it for today. I cancelled it though so it wonâ€™t pull out of your account, youâ€™ll just need to bring me a different check if thatâ€™s okay because now this one is saying it is a duplicate checkâ€ .. Confused I ask if he is SURE it is not going to pull from my account right now and he ensures me it will not and not to worry. We finally, at 9pm, leave the dealership and although it was a lengthy process with a few issues as mentioned, I was thrilled about the purchase and love the car. Two days later, my sunroof stops working and is stuck open and to top it off, on 8/21/2019, 25 days early, I wake up and the check has posted to my account causing it to be overdrawn due to the other purchases I had made over the weekend NOT expecting that money to come out when it was not supposed to. 

I got to the dealership and had been sitting in the sales office waiting for someone to help me resolve this matter since 10:15am. Unfortunately, not everyone has $1000 sitting in their account to spend right at that moment which is why we opted for the deferred payment that they agreed to do. 

About 11am a finance manager as well as another manager came in to speak with me. I explain the situation to them and I am told they have to contact corporate in order to get an answer on reimbursement of the hold check that they were not supposed to deposit until September 14th. I explain to them that I will need to know whatâ€™s happening with this situation THAT DAY and in the mean time will go back down to the used car area and get the detail they had promised. When my car was sent back (at 11am), I was told it will only take an hour in which I explain â€œthatâ€™s perfect. I have to get my daughter by 3â€ .. About 2pm (still waiting on my vehicle) I begin asking around to see if someone can get me an update on where my car is and why itâ€™s taking so long and Iâ€™m told several times that itâ€™ll be just a few more minutes. I do understand details take time. However, they DO NOT take 3 and a half hours! After my 3 and a half hour wait, I am then presented my keys and shown to the door where yet another sales â€œmanagerâ€ proceeds to open the door and tell me â€œyour car is right down there on the other side of that gray truckâ€ .. Oh. Okay. So now we donâ€™t even bring the customers car back up to them? They have to retrieve it themselves? I get in my car, and what do you know? Itâ€™s NOT detailed. What seems to have taken place is that they took my car back to detail, no one got to it then when realizing they hadnâ€™t gotten to it (after SEVERAL reminders from me to check on it because I had to go in order to get my daughter in time) they did a quick wipe down with what seems to be lint covered rag and the car is just as dirty as when I brought it in. 

While waiting on the â€œdetailâ€ I was told that they had spoken with corporate and will be reimbursing me the $1000 and I should have it in my account within 24 hours. Fast forward 24 hours.. no refund. My husband and I return to the dealership Wednesday 8/22/2019 to be told that cross-check and my bank placed a hold on the check but that I would have the refund within 12 hours. Fast forward 12 hours and then another 24.. no refund. Saturday 8/24/2019, a week after purchasing my car, still no refund. My husband returns to the dealership and he is told that on Monday, when accounting gets in, they will cut me a check for the $1000 as well as for any fees we may accrue due to their mistake and they are so sorry for the inconvenience and the finance manager gives my husband $300 out of his own pocket to help the situation. Fast forward to today, Monday 8/25/2019.. no check was cut for us and we are then told that â€œthey canâ€™t cut us a check because they are showing that original check was already returned to us which it was not and we have proven that to every person up there several times by showing them our bank account/statements. 

The run around this place gives not only its customers, but itâ€™s employees as well, is absolutely mind blowing and the lack of accountability and respect is disgusting. Needless to say, we donâ€™t see ourselves being reimbursed for their mistake but I will do my best to make sure anyone I know doesnâ€™t ever do business here.

On Cars.com Review, Viva Nissan asks for a call to be made to the manager but the manager has been unable to reach me. Going on a week for them to call me back, but if they cannot contact the BBB they will not contact me. If the manager wanted me to call back he would leave his name or direct line instead of having me try to guess who I need to speak with.

I took my 2011 Audi A4 for a 55000 miles service.
Bill came up to 2000$. (Oil change, coolant, brake fluid)

I was over billed 300+$ for Tire-rotate and Wheel balancing (which was never done)
They promised a refund for Tire works that was never done.

But later realized that they cheated me, I never got my refund.

Please stay away from Audi-Plano-Service.

22872,06-Apr-19,"I like the Sienna I bought In June 2018. However, when I was signing the Vehicle Buyers Order, there was an item on there that had not been mentioned before. The salesman (I think his name was Dolph)  told me it was for 5 years of oil changes. Since I live it Fort Worth, I told him I did not want it because I would not drive that far for service. He said I should be able to use it anywhere and if not, let them know and they would refund it. Sure enough when I went to Freeman Toyota in November to get my oil changed, it was not honored. Mallorie, the service advisor, researched it and told me it was for the Sport City Oil Change Program and was not transferable. I called and spoke to my salesman at Sport City who said he would speak to his manager and call me back. He did not. I called the finance manager several times, but my calls were never returned. I was out $599 for nothing. As far as I am concerned this is deceptive trade practices so BEWARE!",2,1289,Texas_without_threshold\Toyota47 Reviews of John Eagle Sport City Toyota.csv
15537,05-Apr-19,"DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THE FINANCE PEOPLE OF THIS PLACE.

If I could give zero stars to the finance section of this establishment, I absolutely would.  My story started back on February 23, 2019 and I am still battling with them to this day.  I've tried to be patient but with BILL LITTLE completely disregarding me yesterday and the Finance Manager just happening to be out that day and I have not gotten any message back from the GM, I thought I would take it to the internet because people need to know how to not get screwed.

I purchased a Kia Niro from these guys on Feb. 23.  Walked in with financing already in place for X amount.  Found a car, purchased it with said X check from the bank and used my own CREDIT CARD for the remainder of the car balance, which was roughly $1800 or so.  We then speak with BILL, who scammed us so hard I can't even believe he's still there.  He talked to us about the extended warranty and why we should get it, prices, etc and when he saw I didn't want to pay that much (or really any at all) he was all like ""Oh well here let me give you my employee discount rate.""  In retrospect, that was probably the ACTUAL amount of the warranty and he was just screwing with us, as most dealership people do.  But for whatever reason, I decided to go ahead and purchase it with the guarantee that I could cancel it within 30 days and get a full refund.  THIS IS WHERE THE BATTLE BEGINS.

I asked this man, BILL LITTLE, that since I was paying for this warranty SEPARATELY (ie, I was putting the full $2691 on my CREDIT CARD) that if I did cancel it, if it would be refunded via credit card or paper check since this is the method of payment.  HE. SAID. YES.

Two days later, I walk in and cancel the warranty.  I signed the paperwork he provided and said the refund would credit back to my card within 3-5 weeks.  Good, easy enough, right?  Wrong.  So, so wrong.

I started calling Kia to reach Bill starting on 03/21/19 to speak with Bill and see where the refund status is at since my credit card cycle was closing on 04/03/19 and I needed to know when the $2691 would be hitting.  He did not respond.  He did not call, did not answer messages, anything.  Finally, after calling for days, on 03/30 I got ahold of another lady, (Jenn?) and told her what was going on, she said she'd talk to Bill but since it was the last day of the month (NOT MY FAULT) he might be busy.  I even had a friend go in in person later to stress the urgency of this issue.  Nothing.

Come Monday 04/01, I finally get a call from Bill saying he'd look into it and get back to me by the end of the day.  And of course, he didn't.  I emailed him with my number stating this is really urgent as the cycle closes in mere days.  Nothing on Tuesday 04/02.

I go into the dealership on Wednesday 04/03 to speak with him in person and OF COURSE he is out for the day and NOBODY there has any idea what he's doing.  I am basically told 'sucks to be you, come back tomorrow' even though I stressed how important this is.   Thanks guys, super helpful.

Yesterday, 04/04, Bill finally contacts me (at 12:20pm--so much for ""first thing in the morning"") and said in almost these exact words, ""Due to an error on my part I essentially attached the warranty information to your contract so the refund is going to be processed to your lien-holder and will reduce the amount you owe on the loan with them.""  WHAT. THE. ACTUAL. xxxx.   No Bill, NO.  This is NOT what we discussed.  The lien-holder has NOTHING to do with this.  I made a deal with them for X amount and paid the rest via credit card and did the warranty SEPARATELY.  I was told, on the original DAY that we even did this, that it would be refunded via credit card SINCE THAT IS HOW I PAID FOR THE xxxx THING IN THE FIRST PLACE.  The fact that it was an error on YOUR part, YOURS, has nothing to do with me.  I tried explaining to Bill that this was not acceptable and his basic response was ""you wanted an answer, this is what I got"" with ZERO inclination to actually help solve the issue. No apology, no offer to come in and figure it out, nothing.  I finally said well let me talk to the accounting people then and he mumbled something about them calling me or something then promptly hung up.  Ridiculous.

Hours pass, no call from accounting.  I call Kia AGAIN, this time asking for a finance manager or the GM as I now would A) like to file a formal complaint against Bill and B) I still need to get this $2691 back onto my card and not to the bank, whom has nothing to do with this whatsoever.  I was told the GM was out to lunch and the finance manager, of course, was conveniently out that day.   I left my name and number with the receptionist and was told she'd give it to the GM.   

This brings us to today.  I never got a call from the GM or anybody since 12:20pm yesterday when Bill basically said to suck it.  I now have a $2691 credit card bill due with interest because he could not give me an answer in time, nor do I have the means to actually pay for it WHICH IS WHY I CANCELLED IT IN THE FIRST PLACE.   

I am so fed up.  Nobody is willing to simply hit the ""refund to credit card"" button or take responsibility for messing up. I should not be penalized for BILL'S mistake when he explicitly told me time and time again that getting it on the card was correct.  So here I am.  Waiting to hear from the GM to file a complaint but really all I need is for this $2691 to be given back to ME somehow, not my lien-holder. 

The lack of communication (never heard from Bill or anyone in the 5 weeks that had already passed before he contacted me finally) and blatant disrespect is what has made me reach out to other outlets.  

I would appreciate it if ANYONE from the higher up chain would contact me and get this problem fixed (Bill absolutely has my name and number at this point, as does the GM of this location).  YOUR employee has messed up and he is refusing to take responsibility for it or try to amend it and I cannot believe this would be acceptable in a business setting.",1,888,Texas_without_threshold\Kia33 Reviews of Kia of South Austin.csv

I should have done my homework before giving them my money. I bought a used Nissan in September 2018. It had 20k miles. The finance manager told me that as a condition of our loan, we had to buy the extended warranty. I called the bank the next morning to confirm this and of course, they can not and did not make the requirement, as it is illegal to do so. Shame on me for believing the ""professional."" I called the finance manager, Gerson Gamero and he said that he would send me the cancellation form. I never received it and I called and emailed until I did receive the cancellation form. I sent it back and he never cancelled it. My husband went up there this weekend and spoke to the new finance guy Robert Spivey (since the one we were dealing with no longer works there) and he said he would cancel it...except this is not the full refund that we were promised, it was for half prorated based on the date and mileage. I tried to cancel the warranty that was dishonestly forced on us from the morning after we purchased the car, but he processed it using this weekends date and mileage.
 In addition to all of this, the first finance guy told the car had never been in an accident and showed us the Carfax, which indicated that it had not been. We take it to the Fenton Nissan dealership when the engine light comes on and you guessed it....it has been in a FRONT END COLLISION.

While signing the final papers with the finance manager, they persuaded me to buy a oil change package for $369, which was supposed to give me free oil changes for life anywhere in the US, including my local dealership at my hometown of El Paso. 
When I called Clay Cooley Nissan about 3 months later to inquire about the paperwork for the package, that I was promised to get in the mail, I was told that the free oil changes only applied at Clay Cooley Nissan and no where else. 
After getting the runarounds from Mo, the finance manager, who told me he would try to make the service national, or refund my money, he didnt respond anymore. I was then told that it would cost me $50 in order for the refund to be processed and would take up to 12 weeks. 
Conclusion: All the people involved in the sale knew that my hometown was El Paso and I bevlieve that I was deliberately tricked to buy the package, telling me it would be good in El Paso.

9764,20-Jan-19,"Do Not due business with Automax Ford Service Center! On Oct 5, 2018 I  Took my truck in because of a check engine light, It took them two weeks to actually fix the issue. Kristopher Dearing was the service adviser.  After the first week, they had stated it was fixed, I paid the bill of $2809.00 . They apparently could not find the trouble based on the codes, so they just kept replacing parts  until the check engine light went away. They even recommend a total tune-up on a truck with less than 50,000 miles, This cost $211 alone for 8 spark plugs and wires, and another $460 for labor,  when the  service for a tune-up is not due until 90,000 miles. They charged $125.57 for a so called fuel induction service, that consisted of  a $35.00 charge for a can of spray cleaner, and labor. This after I told them it was a waste of money and I don't want it. Thank you Kristopher Dearing. My truck had the bump/slip driveshaft issue that is listed under a Tech bulletin. Not only did they overcharge  to fix the issue @ $309.00 ,but they actually charged a $115.00 diagnostic fee.  When I picked up the truck, I could not even make it out of the dealership when they check engine light came back on. They kept my truck another week, finally I requested to speak to the supervisor , David Stillsen who said the issues I had were over his head, and advised me to speak to David Brewer. Mr Brewer agreed that I should not have needed a full Tune-up, and agreed to refund the cost of the labor for the tune-up. During our conservation , I leaned they had driven my truck to Nolanville and back but I had 52 miles extra on my truck, which is more than a round  trip to and from Nolanville. He also told me 3 people did the test drive. The person in the rear seat got grease all over my door and seat and literally broke the door latch in half. The did not tell me about the damage, and I ended up taking it back just to fix the damage which Mr. Forte another service supervisor agreed to fix for nothing. According to David Brewer the final issue with my truck was a folded over gasket that was sucking air, which I simply did not believe. I did not get the refund as promised, and went to speak to the General Manager, ( apparent they have 3) and ended up speaking to James Bilello Sales Manager who indicated he did not have the authority to refund any money without first speaking to a General Manager and the owners. This went on for over 4 months, and more visits. I learned Mr. Brewer had been fired during my first visit with Bilello. During my second visit with Bilello he filed out paperwork to request the $460 refund, but I never received it.  This dealership will promise the moon, but beware they are not going to do anything to fix any customer service issues. They kept telling stories, in the hope I would  go away.  Do not bring a vehicle to Automax for anything other than warranty repair, they are unethical and will do and say anything to separate you from your money to including doing things you told them not to do. I will need to take them to small claims court if I expect to get resolve this issue. Finally,  I actually took my truck over to Johnson Brothers in Temple Texas  @ a cost of $185 to make sure Automax had actually replaced the parts they claimed they replaced, When it came to verifying the fuel induction service, I was told there is no way to determine when such a service is need, that  it is recommend  based on miles, and that there was no way to determine if it had actually been done.

12070,25-Nov-18,"This dealership was friendly and helpful at first.  I did NOT want the extended warranty, but the financial manager added it my contract anyway.  When I asked him to remove it, he said he did not NEED to redo the paperwork.  I could just remove the warranty after-the-fact by sending a cancellation order later and that my payments would go back to the original stated amount. But, afterwards - he told me a different story saying the Extended Warranty amount would be credited to the last few payments of the note.  I told him this wasn't acceptable, but he told me he could not change the contract.  I asked for verification that he did cancel the warranty.  He never gave it.  So I called the Extended Warranty office myself.  After 2 months, it turns out that it NEVER WAS cancelled.  I would have been paying for something I had not agreed to and didn't know I had.  I tried to contact the manager of the dealership and he never returned my numerous calls.  After I signed my contract with them, they were VERY uncooperative afterwards.  They knew I was short on time when I came in to purchase and needed to make this deal quickly. They took advantage of that and used it to cheat me.  They also entered my address incorrectly on the financial documents, so I didn't receive my first two statements and had to make my payments by phone.  I feel this was done intentionally in order to keep my fooled that the warranty fee was removed.  I had to cancel the warranty on my own.  The warranty company is supposedly sending me a refund soon.  It will be a check made out to Hyundai Finance.  When I receive it, I am supposed to take it to Hyundai and they will credit my loan.

I worked with Sales Manager Matt, at first he seemed to be very helpful; however that changed the moment I decided the car deal offered was not the best for me, he was very disrespectful. I have small children and would prefer a car with dark interior. I started the paperwork on the new car with a lite interior and last minute thought I should shop around to for what would best fit my family's needs. With already making the down payment, I notified the dealership that I would not be moving forward with signing the paperwork. I then asked if they could process my refund for the down payment. I was told no, ""our policy is to only process refunds on business days"". That did not sound right to me, so I asked for a copy of the policy, in which they could not provide. I asked once more if the refund could be processed and I was told ""no you have to come back on Monday because it is after business hours"". My response was ""that is strange because you process the down payment after business hours, yet you cannot process the refund until business hours?"" I asked once more, if the refund could be processed and the response was ""just get someone in finance to take care of her, because she is ridiculous"". The General Manager and Assistant General Manager were standing near, witnessed and heard the entire conversation, including the policy lies and derogatory comments, yet they never once said anything.

23607,23-Aug-18,"I have been trying to get a warranty refunded for *A YEAR*. Clay Cooley has been hostile the whole time. We just filed a complaint with the State of Texas. He is our experience. DO NOT BUY FROM THEM. We filed a hostile dealership form with the warranty company, who has since refunded clay cooley and they have NOT PASSED THIS MONEY BACK TO US. 

I purchased a car with Clay Cooley Richardson on 8/5/17, I was upsold into also purchasing:
- an AWS extended warranty [$3854], and,
- an AWS maintenance agreement [$700].

When I was able to research the two agreements I realized I was still under manufacturers warranty so did not need an extended warranty and the maintenance agreement was far more expensive than paying for maintenance with a genuine mini dealership.

I gave written notice to cancel both contracts (via email) on 8/15/17 @ 8:47am

I followed up on a response to that cancellation email on 8/15/17 @ 9:47pm

I followed up again by email on 8/18/17

I followed up again by email on 8/23/17

Through this period and the end of 2017 I routinely called Clay Cooley and was repeatedly assured that the cancellations had been sent and that service cancelations just take months to process. Despite asking I was never provided with any evidence they had processed the cancellation

In early 2018, I visited the dealership in person and was greeted by a new finance manager who filled in the cancellation backdated to the initial notice date and faxed it to the service providers.

Again I saw no refund at my end and repeatedly called Clay Cooley to be assured it takes time for cancellations to be processed.

Finally, around May 2018 I researched and called the service providers [The Warranty Group] directly and discovered that both policies were still active and they had no record of ever receiving a cancellation notice.

On 5/12/18 I sent the cancellation form from the dealership to their claims department, who forwarded me to the accounts department who assisted me with doing a customer initiated cancellation.

I provided all required documentation for the customer initiated cancellation on 5/14/18 and received confirmation they had been canceled on 5/18/18 with the refund credited to the dealership as they were unable to directly refund to my finance.

I called and contacted through their website Clay Cooley to inform them of the cancellation. I also gave notice to my finance in case they could assist the process. 

When I saw no refund forthcoming, I again repeated called Clay Cooley to follow up. I also followed up with the service providers and requested a receipt for the cancelation on 7/23/18 and was provided one on 7/30/18

I visited the dealership in person again on 8/10/18 and was assisted by a finance team member, however, they claimed not to have access to see why the refund had not been processed. Following up today they have left the company and their contact details disconnected.

That pretty much sums up my experience with Clay Cooley. I would be surprised if even 50% of my calls have been answered, and then usually only by a receptionist that has forwarded me to a number that has rung out. I have left dozens of voicemails which have never been returned. Their only email contact information is through a form on their website which has always been responded to by calls from their sales team who quickly hangs up when you ask to be forwarded to finance/accounts. I have never recieved a call from finance/accounts either in response to contact from me or reaching out to me to help close out this matter by email or phone call. The few times I have visited in person, the person I met with has left the company within a few weeks.

We explained we were not sure when our refund would show up and we were told they would hold the car with no problem. Right from the beginning we were told the car would be delivered to our home with no trouble, as we live 4 hours from the dealership. March 7th we are asked for a second deposit to hold car, which we did. During our wait on tax refund, we told Matt to sell the car a total of four times, as he was pressuring us to come up with more and more money. Each time he would refuse and say he wanted us to have the car. March 29th we obtained a cashiers check in the total amount owed on the car and delivery was scheduled to be delivered March 31st. At 9:56 a.m. March 31st we received a call from Matt stating they would not deliver the car and we would need to go pick it up. Again we told them to sell the car and we would not be coming to get the car. As we were told it would be delivered to our home from the beginning. They ended up delivering the car April 5th with one blown tire and four others that were in such bad shape no reputable place would have passed it for inspection. The crack on the side of the tires is so deep you can put a coin in it and wires are visible. However the car was inspected and passed for registration by Bossier Dodge. The temporary deaer tag expired April 20th. When you buy a car from a dealer the tags should last way longer than 15 days.

We have bought four other new tires. The car had a few minor issues, such as radiator fluid leaking and an oil leak from the oil filter. But we have fixed those issues.

My dad decided to sign the paperwork so that I could easily get the car on my own since he works out of town. I put a down payment of $1500.Luis then stated that for the car to be ready, they had to service it and added an additional $990 to the loan. The service would include an 150 point inspection, oil change, detail, and they would wax the car. Upon completing the paperwork, Luis told us that the car would not be ready until the next day and gave me a rental. The next day, Thurs, Luis said that it will be ready until Fri. On Fri, Luis had not called at all. On Sat, my dad called Luis and he said that it would be ready on Mon at 11a. On Mon, at 12p, the car was not ready! By that time, I had decided that I had enough & it was best to take my business somewhere else. I told Luis that I would return the rental on Tuesday and I wanted them to refund me my down payment and send the bank the appropriate paperwork. When I was on my way to return the rental Tues, Luis called me and told me that they would give me $315 for my first car note so that I could take the car. When I got there to see if they actually serviced it, my dad had noticed that the car was in the SAME CONDITION that we had left it. I told his boss BEN who was taking care of us that I DID NOT want the car because why pay so much money for something or a service you're not getting? BEN GOT VERY NASTY with my dad and RAISED HIS VOICE several times. We decided to leave. On Wed, I tried calling to speak to the manager ALDO who is also very rude. I probably called the dealership 10 different times for them to send the paperwork to the bank and they were reluctant. I got so desperate I even called the owner C. Gillman who to this day, has not returned any of my calls. However, he had the time to tell them to offer me a $200 gift card for me to take the car. I declined. Days later, my dad and I made one final trip to the dealership to talk to MARCO C. because he said that the manager was willing to refund the $990 WE PAID for services they DID NOT PROVIDE. When we got there, he said that the manager had changed his mind and the most they could give us was the $315. We said no, we donâ€™t want the car. But, in order for him to start the refund process he needed the approval from Ben. Ben said that I would not be able to get my down payment of $1500 at all. To remind you, I had NOT TAKEN the car off of the lot. The BMW had been in THEIR POSSESSION since we went to look at it a week before and I test drove it & we did the paperwork. Yet they DID NOT want to refund me my hard earned money or send the bank the draft so that My dad can get another loan. Because of all of the trouble they were giving us, we decided to just take the car. When I looked at the odometer it had 69k, but yet when WE FIRST PURCHASED the car, it had about 67k. They had the car for weeks. WHO COULD HAVE BEEN DRIVING IT PUTTING ALMOST 2k ON IT? I HAVE NO IDEA! FAST FOWARD to this weekend, I took the car to BMW to get an oil change. To my surprise, they said I was 8k miles overdue for one, & the reason I didnâ€™t know was because the timer had most likely been tampered with. While servicing the car, they noticed that the oil drain was tightened way too tight & it was an OFF MARKET PART, not a BMW one, & in order to fix it it would cost me $2200. Furious, I called Honda to let them know & they said they could not do anything as far as reimbursement although they were the last ones to service the car. Even a BMW WORKER CALLED THEM to let them know & they said they sent the car off to a dealership but yet couldnâ€™t give that information. Which means THEY DID IT & SOLD ME A MESSED UP CAR! & THEY DONT WANT TO HELP PAY FOR IT! Itâ€™s so frustrating! I would NEVER RECCOMMEND OR RETURN TO THEM! C.

I have talked with Finance department Johnathan, left messages with Abby in finance, talked with Kim in the office, who at first said that was nothing they could do and somebody should have contacted me and was sorry.   I have left messages with GM, Eddie, with no response.
 
When I called GM warranty, they advised me that the problem was with the dealership since they did not submit a signed contract, which I and the dealership has.  My truck has been in the shop for repairs that I am waiting for over a week and this is an extreme hardship.   Now Parts and Service Director, Terry, would not provide last name, said there was nothing he could do, but refund my money, yet no warranty.

One of two things happened.  1. I was not asked to place a deposit to hold the car, which I would have, to ensure it was still there when I arrived.  Or 2. Someone had already had a deposit on the vehicle when we spoke and your the sales manager (Charlos) failed to communicate that to me.  In either case, thatâ€™s not the service I would expect.

22959,12-Apr-18,"First off, the salesman Abdul N. was friendly when showing you around. Then he start playing games like pretending to run back and forth between me and his management team over a reasonable price. He promise to offer a $100 referral bonus if I persuade my partner to buy the truck. Anyway after we reach an agreeable price, he make you sign a ""sell as is"" document. This document is a scam because in the time we sit in the office and negociate prices and financial plan with the finance department, he (the salesman) go outside and start figuring what he can steal from your vehicle like the new carpet and all the perks of buying a new car from a dealer. When we finish our financial payment plan and drive off the dealer, we are dead tired and didn't bother paying attention to what was stolen. We only figure what was stolen and missing the day after. He never give us the $100 referral bonus he'd promised too. When I inquired him about it, he said to leave my mail address and the customer service team will send me the $100 check. I never receive it. All in, He scam me the $100 referral bonus he'd promised and a set of new Tacoma carpet which I don't know the value of. Also maybe other dealer gifts and perks that I don't know about since he is in control of what he is giving out. Second, never ever trust a financial manager under any circumstances was the hard lesson I learned from this dealership. I knew since ages ago to never trust a financial manager at any dealership, but this time I was introduce to a fellow Vietnamese by the name of Nhan Le. My partner and I trusted him so much because he is a fellow Viet, the kind of trust that some people do when they meet someone from their culture or heritage. We trust him so much we agree to whatever payment plan he recommend. The biggest scam from this dealership is when Nhan Le recommend us to buy the Mechanic Protection Plan. We immediately reject the idea but Mr. Le said ""that we can try it out for 30 days and after 30 days we can cancel it for a full refund."" He insist we try it out since it cost us nothing if we cancel it. We agreed and fell into the finance department's trap. We took the time to go to this dealership during Lunar New Year Celebration just to cancel the Mechanical Protection Plans on time in hope to get a full refund like Mr. Le suggested. We submit to him the filled and signed cancellation documents hoping everything is in good hand. Mr. Le never submit our cancellation documents. After a few months and I have no evidence of refund for the Mechanical Protection Plan, I got worry and call Mr. Le's office many time. He never pick up his phone, not even once even when I leave multiple recorded message to request a call from him. I call The MPP headquarter and a customer rep said they never receive any cancellation document for my plan. She said she can help me start a cancellation process but it has to be based on the current month. I finish the process with her. Over the next few days I try to call Mr.Le to get some answer from him but all my calls ignored. I call the dealership front desk and have them set me up with a random financial manager in hope to catch Mr. Le who's avoiding me. First I got a guy name Victor who said he can't help me. Then I got another guy name Mark who claimed he is Mr Le's supervisor and that I should give him a days to investigate the matter. He promised (haha I know) he'd call me back early the next day to resolve my situation. I never got his call. The refund from MPP cancellation came and we lost $1.5k. Nice colluding work Finance Department. Ya'll deserve a nice big bonus from Mr. Myer at the end of the year for sure, but will you live long and healthy enough till the end of the year to get that bonus?

I spoke with their fiance director John Martinez and explained to him that I just needed my money back, and he told me the same thing that they don't deal with that and I need to call the accounting.  I was like why didn't you say this thing they first time I ever called your department!!

This down payment is something we obviously paid for at the dealership, prior to leaving with the car. We used a debit card and their card processor. The funds left our account within minutes. Here we are, two months later, and they are still claiming they never received the funds. Jake called and asked us to send him proof that the funds left our account, so we did. He said that should be sufficient enough. Then, after still not sending our plates, he asked us to call the bank and see where they sent the money. My husband and I both called he bank separately and they told us they followed the money trail to Land Rover. We even tried to phone call in Jake with the bank but he was â€œbusy.â€ After completing his second request, they still wonâ€™t send us our plates. They have apparently figured out that the money is stuck somewhere between the bank and their credit card company, which is out of my hands, yet they STILL wont send me my plates after we have repeatedly done what they asked of us.

Pricing was verbally confirmed over the phone and we agreed on the deal. The first time I spoke with the Finance Manager Nigel, he said to get the agreed upon price I would HAVE to finance with them, that was never told to me in the beginning and I wanted to use my credit union, regardless I wanted the car so I reluctantly agreed. Gave all my information and completed a credit app, they ended up pulling my credit 3 times with 3 different lenders. It took them over 36 hours to respond because they are a ""high volume dealer and were too busy to call me back"" I finally asked to see the purchase contract after a day of not hearing anything, when they showed it to me there were $2500 in dealer add ons that was NEVER communicated to me before. I managed to negotiate down most the dealer add-ons but again. . . they were FORCING me to buy the Dealer Installed GPS Tracking (Apex Protection Plan) in order to buy the car. They stated they it could not be removed - LIES. Funny thing is Apex Protection Plan headquarters is right next door to the dealership. I wrote a long email stating that I wanted to see an update purchase contract that reflects my credit card deposit before they mailed it out to me and how they haven't been transparent in this whole process. I never heard from them again and they sold the car to someone else WHILE we were still working on the deal. Please stay away for your own good. Brandon the sales rep was nice however very inexperienced and would lie to help close the sale. Nigel would constantly blame the sales team for not being transparent and up front when.

11868,24-Aug-17,"We bought a new CRV on June 1, 2015 and asked our salesman if the 5 yr warranty we had bought the previous year on our 2009 Honda would transfer.  He told us not but they would refund us the unused portion.  The man in finance said both of our warranties had expired on mileage.  Which was not possible since our 2009 Honda only had 50000 miles when we traded it in on June 2015, a year after the first warranty would have expired in August 2014.  He said my next warranty had expired on mileage, that was impossible because it was less than a year old.  That gentleman also kept trying to sell us a 72,000 mile warranty on our new car, I told him repeatedly I wanted 60,000 miles.When I got home, he had changed some of the contract to 60,000 but some of it was 72,000 miles.  I complained on a comment letter that was sent and apparently it went to Honda.  My salesman, who we like and both of our last two cars from, called me and said Honda wanted me to come in and talk to the finance manager.  I ask for the manager but was sent a sales person from finance to tell me he was not available, could he help me.  So I explained the problem and looked at the computer and told me that the first warranty had expired on miles (not true) and the second one was only for a year and 36000 miles and had expired on miles.  First, it was for 5 years and 60,000 miles.  Even if it had been as he said, it had not been a full year and we had not put 15,000 miles in a year on the car.

10897,02-Jul-17,"I purchased a vehicle from this dealership on June 30th, 2017.
I am going to start out this review with the positives:
My salesman James C., Ernest (and his bearded coworker - sorry I did not get your name), and DJ the finance manager. These men handled themselves with dignity and professionalism. My entire experience with my salesman was very positive from start to finish. If I could rate these men alone they would get 5 of 5. I was referring individuals to this dealership due to my interactions and experience with James, before they decided to attempt to not honor an agreement.
The negatives:
The amount of trouble I had to get this dealership, specifically the general manager, to honor an agreement.
Jack O'Diamonds accepted my deposit in May, signed car info and MSRP agreement, and took copies of documentation from me so we would be ready to get the purchase going when the car arrived (ID, Social, Insurance, finance info). Communications with this dealership made every indication the purchase would be made upon arrival. On the last day of the carâ€™s ETA I am told that the manager regrets the MSRP agreement and decided to hold the car for a minimum of 90 days (confirmed by a call I made to the sales manager) to draw customers in to get their moneys worth. I was not informed of this until June 28th (the last day of my ETA). I was told the transport truck with the car arrived, but left without delivering it. I never claimed they had it, just that they rescinded their agreement to sell it to me when it DID arrive.
I have seen claims that I should have talked to the dealership before I posted a video. I confirmed the 90 day hold situation with both my salesman and the sales manager as soon as I was informed and before the video discussing my experience was ever created. I intentionally stayed away from posting any reviews or encouraging individuals to do so, even though it appeared employees were attempting to bait me into posting in the review section by calling me out in their reviews. What other people do with information given is not under my control. 
When the Jalopnik article discussing this situation was posted I was not contacted by the author, who made a couple of incorrect assumptions based off of what other individuals misinterpreted. I saw some errors and immediately posted a clarification (not a retraction) on Facebook publicly, the article comments itself, and emailed the author directly. The dealership has continually addressed issues that I did not claim and ignored the actual issues.
In a meeting that my salesman was not allowed in, even though we requested him, the GM stated he was at fault for this situation, but he was still going to keep the car in the show room. He has on multiple occasions stated if my experience wasnâ€™t positive I wouldnâ€™t have an experience with them at all. I have these claims documented.
In every interaction the GM threatened to give me my deposit back if I didnâ€™t have a positive experience and stop â€œlyingâ€ or attempted to convince me to take my deposit back. Throughout all of this they called it my car, but would not back anything up with writing (since my documents for my initial deposit before they changed their minds about the agreement).
The personal and unprofessional level this dealership took this to.
I received after-hours phone calls from the GM to accuse, manipulate, and vent at me (when he was off work). Employees of the dealership messaged my friends on Facebook to speak negatively of me and call me a liar. Employees who are not friendly towards me attempted to â€œfriendâ€ me on Facebook.
The environment of the dealership when they changed their mind (due to the negative feedback they were receiving) and allowed to purchase the car.
I was not assisted until I texted the GM I had arrived, even though many workers were clearly not busy as they spent their time pacing around us and glaring. Which is unlike the experience my friend had coming in to meet me there. He walked through the doors and was immediately greeted by a nearby salesman. I have these claims documented and witnesses to this.
The bottom line is: dealerâ€™s remorse is not the customer's responsibility. The agreement was honored not because of the integrity of the dealership, but because they got called out. There was time before the backlash got out of control to make this right.
Yes I have my car now, but I am not a satisfied customer. However, I stuck to my agreement and bought the car upon arrival at MSRP.

It is a shame I had to give even 1 star rating, there was not an option for less.  My wife put a $500 deposit for a Miata-RF with El Dorado Mazda and they would have to order it from Japan.  They estimated it would take about 12 weeks.  6  weeks passed and she thought she'd call them to see how it was progressing.  Their response was ""we thought you cancelled"".  Really?  Where did they get that?  They had no explanation for that answer.  In fact they never followed up, phone call, letter, email or otherwise.  I assume they just intended to forget about it and keep the $500.  We drove back to El Dorado Mazda to get a refund and she felt sorry for the old salesman who offered an non-sincere apology.  She let him ""try again"" with a promise that he would follow up with a phone call by Tuesday or at the very latest on Wednesday (that conversation was on Friday).  I made him repeat it to me twice that he was going to follow up and even said ""I expect a follow up call by Wednesday at the latest"" (5 days later).  He repeated it and apologized again.  It is now Friday and we've not heard a thing from El Dorado Mazda.  I called this afternoon and asked why he hadn't followed up with the phone call as promised.  He said ""we can't get you that car"".  I asked why hadn't he followed up.  He just apologized.  I told him his apologies mean nothing and that is word means nothing to us anymore.  We'll be returning to El Dorado Mazda Monday for a refund.  

It is obvious now that El Dorado Mazda's intent is to sell you what they have on hand, and put fourth no effort to get the car you're looking for.  I am not one to give in to their sales pitch and accept what they have.  

There are dealerships out there that appreciate your business, El Dorado Mazda IS NOT one of them.

After the second car I bought there was paid off, John Eagle Honda was notified on January 17th 2017 to process a refund check of $246.93 for GAP insurance which was purchased with the vehicle. According to the law that is their responsibility and I thought it will be done in a timely manner.
Being aware that there will be some processing time I didnâ€™t inquire about it, but after a few weeks I called to check on the status of refund check. And that is where the fun starts. Most of the time it is very hard to get any of financial guys to answer and I left messages.  A lot of them, but no call back.
After I used their online portal and sent an email, one of the guys called (I think his name was Adam) to lecture me it could take up to one month to process the check. 
Waiting again for more than a month and then went to the dealership a week or more ago.
Spoke to one of financial guys (I think Many) and he checks the paperwork and it is a miracle. The check was cut that morning and I should receive it shortly.
Not a word from him when I said you guys lost a loyal customer because of a couple of hundreds of dollars or an apology.
Working in customer service for over 20 years I had seen it all but this is the top of the top. I canâ€™t comprehend it; it just does not make any sense.
While waiting for the refund check I have decided to donate it to charity on behalf of John Eagle Honda. If I ever receive it.",1,691,Texas_without_threshold\Honda44 Reviews of John Eagle Honda of Houston.csv
2499,13-Mar-17,"This dealership has lost their way.  Do not buy and never look at this place for service. They took advantage of my niece and told her a bulb needed to be replaced and that the bummer need to be removed to get to it. It happens as always they didn't need to pull the bumper and will not refund a $64 charge for a simple bulb. All of this was of this was after they charged her over $200 for work not needing to be done. Don, David from the service Department and Rick the service manager all make Freedom proud the ways they take advantage of hard working people to make a buck for the dealership. It's all in the name ""Freedom"", Freedom to steal all of our money. ",1,208,Texas_without_threshold\Chevrolet30 Reviews of Freedom Chevrolet - San Antonio.csv
18870,24-Feb-17,I went and purchased the part to be replaced and specifically requested what I wanted done to my vehicle. When I asked for a quote they gave a quote but which included diagnostic test which I declined they run given I already knew what was wrong with my vehicle. Ms. Gordon in service stated that if I was requesting a certain service to be done that they would do that and I would not be charged. The tech Feliz quoted me a different price and I asked that they just do install and program ONLY!!!! I was still charged and they still did a diagnostic test which I did not receive nor did they explain if they found anything else wrong. When I spoke with the manager today he was rude and said I agreed for them to do the test and that they would credit my account which all I want is a refund of the $120 that I was charged.. I will not be going back to this dealership for service on my car they do not listen to customer when they ask something not be done. Mr. Munoz in parts was really friendly and helpful and was there when I said what I wanted done to my car. Even on the receipt only says labor charge and does not have how much I was actually charged for install and programming. The cashier was even confused so I feel as if they scammed me and it's not fair especially since I'm a single mother and all I needed was what I asked when I already knew what the problem was.....,2.2,1096,Texas_without_threshold\Nissan52 Reviews of Tom Peacock Nissan.csv
23566,13-Jan-17,"I leased a Passat from this dealership two years ago.  in the summer of 2016, we decided we needed to trade it in on something bigger as we were about to have our second child.  After we traded in our VW, my wife and I went to the dealership and filled out paperwork to get a refund on our extended warranty and service contract.  We were told it would be 6-8 weeks and we would receive a check in the mail.  After 10 weeks, I called to follow up with the dealership.  No one from the finance department returned my calls for a week, and when I finally talked to someone, I was informaed that something happened in processing and it would be taken care of within 1-2 weeks.  It has now been 17 weeks and I have still not received anything.  No one that has said they would call me with an update has followed up, and we are still without our refund.  We loved our VW, and would absolutely consider one down the road for a commuter, unfortunately, I have lost all faith and trust in this dealership.",2,1319,Texas_without_threshold\Volkswagen39 Reviews of McKinney Volkswagen.csv
