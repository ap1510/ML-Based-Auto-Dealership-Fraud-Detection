4584,0,21-Jun-20,"Terribly disappointed in my experience at San Marcos Chrysler/Dodge/Jeep.. First time ever buying a used vehicle, and the dealership refused to honor the advertised price online. Once I agreed to the price as advertised online (on several websites), test drove the vechicle, paid a mechanic to look it and was literally returning to the dealership to purchase the vechicle I was informed that there was a $2,396 addendum to the vechicle price. I was informed by the used car sales manager that this addendum is added to the cost of all used vehicles at this dealership. The addendum included such things as window tinting, paint protection plan,  nitro added to the tires and VIN etching. I informed the used car sales manager that I was never told about the addendum (the sales associate confirmed he never disclosed it to me until 10 minutes before I returned to the lot) and I told the used car sales manager that I did not want these services. I was happy to waive them and purchase the vechicle as originally planned. He informed me that these items and costs were already performed and built into their price on the vechicle but not included in the online price. I informed him that the windows on the vechicle were not even to tinted to which he offered to have them tinted in the future but that he would not/could not waive the cost. I then informed him that I would waive any possible claim under the paint protection plan, he said that too was included in the price of the vechicle. When I asked to see the terms of the paint protection plan I was informed that there are no written details/contract, but rather I should
just come back to the dealership if there was an issue in the future. When I asked for proof that I was purchasing the paint protection plan I was informed there was no paperwork available to verify that either. 

I ended up purchasing the vechicle because I had already invested time and money (mechanic review) into the vechicle, but It was an absolutely horrible experience. You may expect this type of treatment and dishonest advertising and dealing from a typical used car lot but I expect a much higher degree of professionalism and experience at a franchise dealership. I believe the manufacturer should review the practices of this dealership before renewing or expanding their franchise.

I also asked the used car sales manager for an opportunity to visit with the general manager only to be informed that he was unavailable and that they would not try and contact him.

18460,0,11-Jun-20,"Found a truck on Autotrader, also looked it up on the dealership website, and sent an inquiry from their website. Asked for the out the door (OTD) price in the initial inquiry. Received a response from two different individuals from the sales department, neither addressed, nor included the OTD quote. Most places require two prompts for the OTD price, so nothing out of the ordinary yet.

One response included the subject “Crest Nissan is honored to assist you”. Sounds good, but as the communications continue, seemingly just empty words in the end, no substance. The email I received from the “Internet Sales Manager” included this phrase: “My ultimate goal is to make sure you have an exceptional experience here at Crest Nissan, and to make sure you have all the information you need to make an informed decision.” More placebo.

Also of note is that when I first found the truck the advertised price on both platforms was $16498. That was Saturday, and by Sunday it was $17548. A couple of days later it showed to be $16952, with a note on one of the pictures of the truck (on their website) price lowered! Is it really lowered when you raised the price previously? And on 6/11/2020 the price shows $16948.

Asked for the OTD price a third time, still no response, just another question about when I could come see the truck. At this point I began to question the lack of pricing transparency, first red flag. Second red flag, the changing sales price.

I requested the OTD price again explaining that my financial institution needed to know the OTD price to provide an accurate interest rate, since that is based on the loan to value ratio. I did not hear back from Shon (he might have been busy, or off that day), so I forwarded the email to Mark. I was then informed of this bit of info by Mark: “We price our vehicles assuming our customers will be financing with us.” Reading between the lines I asked if this meant the price of the truck would be higher if I had my own financing. Mark replied with: “It's 10% higher, and we can most likely get whatever your bank is giving you.” Third red flag! This was not disclosed anywhere on either platform.

Why would a stealership “force” you to finance with them??? So they can make their money on an inflated interest rate. The advice has always been, have your financing lined up prior to stepping foot into a dealership. This is helpful in determining how much you are able to borrow, and the interest rate, which too will impact what you can afford on a monthly basis… remember the phrase “to make sure you have all the information you need to make an informed decision.”

Oddly enough I also received an email from the Internet Sales Director to check in with me. His email included this phrase: “I also wanted to let you know about our Best Price Guarantee and our 3-day, no hassle, return policy. Overall, I want to make sure you are completely satisfied! “

I replied to the Internet Sales Director to state my observations up to this point. It appears that this was forwarded to Shon, who then replied. In his reply he stated: “negotiations are always done best in person to make sure you're serious, and not curious”. The reason for internet departments is to cut through the chase, agree on a price (which is listed online), and barring any issues with the vehicle makes it a done deal. Regarding “serious, and not curious”, does that not contradict the “make an informed decision” comment? If you are not willing to inform a curious customer, he will not turn into a serious buyer.

He also stated: “If you would like me to print the numbers up for you so we can work a deal before you arrive, I have no problem with that.” To which I commented “I have asked for the out the door price three, or four times, so I am unclear as to why this would still be a question at this point.” Regarding his statement “So we can work a deal before I arrive” What is there left to negotiate? The price should be the advertised price, plus applicable taxes (inventory tax, sales tax, title & registration fees), and any document fees your dealership charges.”

When I inquired with my financial institution about an estimated OTD price of $18500, that was already at 108% loan to value. So if Crest were to add many of the fees on that are mentioned in many of other reviews, it would increase the interest rate even more.

Oddly enough, no response back from Shon, not even 24 hours later - why would that be? Because he already knows that the bogus, and unrealistic additional charges will not be accepted? It makes it appear as they only like to deal with customers they can bully, or are so timid that they will just accept all of the charges they want to tack on, after they get you in the door. Any dealership that is truly transparent with their pricing will let you know up front what the out the door price is and honor it when you walk in the door.

Many reviews have mentioned this stealerships practice of listing a sales price, want you to come into the stealership and then inflate the price. As well as wanting to run a credit check right away. 

Most dealerships have adopted to the new age, this dealership appears to still use sales tactics from the 1970's.

Same standard reply on negative reviews: ""we take customer satisfaction very seriously here at Crest Nissan, and we’d love to hear more about your experience."" How about fixing the issues from the start, change your unprofessional business tactics, and you will not have a need to fix them after the fact.

When reviewers mention the additional charges for dealer prep, etc. that they refused to pay the response from Crest is usually ""Unfortunately, we are not always able to come to an agreement on pricing"". This has nothing to do with ""pricing"", you advertised a sales price online, that:
a. you increase when outside financing is used
b. apparently charge for certified warranties on vehicle that were advertised as certified to begin with
c. apparently  charge dealer prep/dealer added ""options"" on used cars",1,1084,Texas_without_threshold\Nissan38 Reviews of Crest Nissan.csv

Only to be told that wasn’t the price and there was nothing they could do about it because “it’s already priced so low we are losing money on it.” Typical salesman BS. They put in certifications and Apex system and claimed that they were 100% required if I wanted to purchase this vehicle.

17853,3,25-May-20,"IF I COULD I WOULD GIVE THIS DEALER A NEGATIVE RATING!!!!!!!!!!!!

I currently Have a 2018 Nissan Armada,   Like it except two things, outdated technology and bad gas mileage.   However this dealer promoted 0% interest rates this weekend and reached out to ask questions about  2020 models, if technology had been updated since 2018, their advertised discounts on the vehicle I was interested in and the 0% interest rates.  Financially it would make sense to buy a new 2020 vehicle at 0% interest  vs. keeping my current vehicle at my current rate.   

I chatted with or spoke to 4-5 ppl over 3 days.  I even texted with a finance manager who verified the car had Apple Car Play and Also said I could 0% interest based on my reported credit score after they validated my credit score. I explained i will only come if these two items can be assured.  Which he did.   

Thinking I was dealing with a reputable dealer and getting confirmation on my deal breakers I went to the dealer.   Thats when I realized all the lies multiple ppl told me.   In fact, apple care play is not available on any Aramada even though their website specifically says other wise.  The lie is repeated on every individual Aramada SL and Platinum models in stock.   I'm Smart enough not to fall for their sleazy car sales lingo and after a lengthy conversation they admitted their website was wrong.   They know they are mis advertising their cars to get you to come in.  Then they asked what I was currently paying on my Aramada.   Again, Im smart enough Never to fall for this sleazy sales tactic.    Dont for fall for that trick,  you'll Get screwed. Its another way they try and manipulate you.  

Thinking a  0% loan on a 2020 would be a better financial move, I started talking price and financial Terms and they repeatedly lied again.   Suddenly the sales price increased from the online posted  sticker price online for the specific car I was interested in.    Their offer also didnt discount the car the same amt as advertised online.   More lies.   Next they tried to add a $2995.00  junk fee for the dealer to provide their regular day to day services you get buying a car. I called them out on every lie and manipulation.  On round three of negotiations,   I was now told 0% interest rate was not available on Armadas at all.   Hard to know where the degree of lying occurred here.  Either 0% is never offered on Armada's or they will only Give you 0% interest rate if you are willing to way over pay on a vehicle to the tune of $5-6K in my instance.  

Buyer beware!   I will never buy a car from Clay Cooley!   They  tell lies after lies after lies to sell over priced cars

Be an educated consumer.   Get approved for financing at a bank before going to dealer.   Make them itemize every detail About your deal before agreeing or signing anything.  If they tried to offer a deal with a piece of paper consisting of 4 blocks with their offer.  Tear it up in front of them.  Demand to have a formal
Line item detailed offer with all the specifics of the offer.   Sales price, discounts,   Any additional dealer junk fees they try to add, interest rate, term of loan, etc.     Then verify the sales price and discounts available against what is listed online for The specific vehicle ID number you want.  

Also, never answer their question about what you want your car payment to be.  Another sleazy sales tactic that will cause you to over pay!",1,1058,Texas_without_threshold\Nissan114 Reviews of Clay Cooley Nissan.csv
2810,0,13-May-20,"I spoke to David in the internet sales department.  I inquired about a car they had that I found on Car Gurus.  I emailed them and then called them.  Everything seemed to be going well in our conversation until we came to dealer fees.  They charge $2,495 as a mandatory add on for a GPS tracker.  Yes, that is two thousand, four hundred,and ninety five dollars.  I told David I had no interest in that package and he said it is mandatory and if I didn't want the GPS tracker installed that they would just raise the sale price of the car by that amount.  Keep in mind this has nothing to do with the bank wanting a tracking device as I was planning to pay cash.  It is sad that the dealership feels the need to false advertise the price to get customer interest.  If you want a certain price for the vehicle then ask for it.

11460,0,10-May-20,"Beware of Hidden fees!!! BAIT & SWITCH!
The price they listed on their website is not what they will quote you in person! I also used the USAA TrueCar app which gives Military discount price but they don’t follow it. What is the point of having those apps as a tool for car buying guide if dealership doesn’t follow it. The salesman and manager will always find a way to make an excuse and blame something like inaccurate prices on USAA TrueCar app that promises accuracy and instant price breakdown on vehicles from dealership that they partnered with. I mean c’mon it’s 2020, stop living like it’s 1985! People can find the answer over the internet nowadays and compare. It’s disappointing and that they treat people like veteran customers with a whopping extra $2100 on the top of a used car valued under $15k!!! By the law, consumers only pay for Tax, Title, and License (registration). Document fees should be at the maximum of $150. I was told that the $2100 is to recoup the cost for the reconditioning of the vehicle and when I checked the battery the sticker was dated 06/18 which is 2 years old!!! Make sure y’all check the battery stickers for date (warranty) and tires are stamped with dates because that’s how manufacturers keep track of the warranty! Don’t let dealership ripoff honest people and don’t let Honda Burleson take your hard earned money. Only pay for what is listed on the website and the Actual Vehicle Value. Any extras like tint, wheel locks, and etc are not required to pay by the law! Dealership installed items are gimmicks! I understand the work that is done but if they are going to charge me extra $2100 for reconditioning then why they didn’t even fix the bumper damage of the car. The only thing that is relevant to the repairs are the new tires and that’s it! When I talked to the manager I told him that I don’t want to pay for dealership fee $2100 because it’s not listed on their website. They will try to argue and show you the generic message (footnotes*) thinking they can somehow make you believe that you are required to pay extra because you are stupid enough not to understand the internet price and basic math! Stop making excuses, be fair and honest to customers. Don’t even mention transparency if you can’t itemized the items for charging extra $2100. It’s a xxxx used car! Not an antique. Car buying experience should be fun but my salesman asks me questions like I’m a dollar sign! Be knowledgeable on the product and explain the functionality of the vehicle before proceeding with the price and then don’t go to your manager when you can’t decide about the final price because you don’t make the finance decisions! You’re a salesman for a reason so earn your title, managers manages employees and not customers! I can’t even imagine how they make sales in new car department...

22070,1,10-May-20,"This is the type of dealership that gives the car buying business a bad name. Did a lot of research for what was a fair price for the truck I was looking for.  Got a quote from TrueCar with an estimated price that was on the lower end but still in the range of what other dealerships were offering. Chose to check out this location first due to it being my preferred color and trim.  I test drove the vehicle and spoke to a very nice sales associate and indicated I would be interested in the car for the right price.  Her manager or finance person then came over an outlined outrageous costs for the car. The total was over 10k more than what truecar quoted and about 5k over what their own website shows.  All before tax title and license. Not really interested in paying nearly 15k over what I saw online, I indicated that the price seemed high. They basically charge full MSRP then add on a “lone star package” and a “security package” that add 5k to the cost of the car.  He made it sound like those extras were upgrades to the car but that was already added to to the MSRP as noted on the car sticker. He also acted like the car really should have been more but they reduced the MSRP and that the rebate was something they helped us out with rather than being a manufacture incentive. Tried to negotiate but sales manager was obviously more interested in making 10k off a car rather than actually making a fair sale. Not sure what I find worse, the fact that they use false advertising to waste people’s time to try to come to the dealership to overcharge them or the fact that uninformed buyers will pay full price plus 5k.

19315,2,09-May-20,"We went in on 5/9/2020 to look at Nissan Rogue Sports, which were being advertised at $17,700.  I'm not naive enough to think that $17,700 is the drive-away price, but the salesman we dealt with, Drey Pryor (sp?), told us that it was going to cost $26,000.  Are you kidding??

So they pulled the classic ""bait and switch"" which, by the way, is an actionable Deceptive Trade Practice in Texas.  But whatever, no hurt feelings.  I can brush off slimy sales practices and just head somewhere else without a care in the world.

What I CANNOT abide (and the real reason for my post) is how incredibly rude Drey was toward us.  He was aggressive, patronizing, and dismissive of any questions we asked.  He spent about 5 minutes talking to us, which was mostly him lecturing us about why we were naive to think the car would actually cost anything CLOSE to the advertised price.  He lectured us about waxing, ""scotch guard"" crap, refurbishing costs, etc.  

I repeatedly asked for a statement showing the drive-away price and the charges that would go into the price but he wouldn't accommodate us.

When we said we couldn't pay what he was demanding, he stormed off without even saying goodbye.  As soon as we finished saying the price was too high, he stood up and walked off, saying ""take care"" when his back was already to us.

Of course, they brought in the paperwork and a ""security package"" of $2995. had been added to the online price.  I told them I would pay the online advertised price only.  They came back with more paperwork and had reduced the security package price to $995.00.  The sales lady told me to draw a line through the $995. and write at the bottom of the paper that I would pay the online advertised price and then sign it.  That's what I did.  We were at the dealership over two hours.  I had already picked out the car so that time was spent doing I don't know what!
Upon arriving home, I noticed the one key that I was given was cracked and was missing part of the plastic.  I emailed the sales lady asking for a replacement key free of charge.   She said she asked her sales manager and she told me ""he said the vehicle was sold at a loss well below market value.

He explained to me that the vehicle also will go through inspection before they are ready to sell, but he let me take the vehicle for 48 hours for the inspection by my mechanic which I appreciated. Before I could return the truck I got a call that someone else was also looking to buy the truck. I said I was still interested but I will go ahead and wait for the truck to be inspected by the dealer before we talk numbers. I was explained that the only way the sales price would change is dependent on how much money it would cost to repair things on the truck. So i got to the dealer and It must have been only 30 minutes and he came back with only one issue that the truck had (needed new batteries) I was surprised that the inspection was done so quick but more to my surprise was how many things the dealer missed when Conducting this inspection.  This whole time I had been under the impression that their inspection would take at least a day which i would have been fine. He then goes to tell me that this negotiation process is unfair because my mechanic had the vehicle for 24 hours. The sales guy explained to me that he was unsure how much they could repair due to the fact that the service center was closed, and instead of holding off till we got prices, he had the audacity to tell me that the other person who would want to buy the truck would pay the price without the repairs. How could a sales individual or dealer be comfortable selling a vehicle that had many mechanical and safety concerns and just sell the car as is? Then he mentioned that because of the time they could not put a hold on the vehicle and they couldn’t guarantee that it would be there the next day.  In order to make the sale he talked to the manager and stated they would write up a contract and repair everything needed that was addressed by my mechanic with the condition that i could not negotiate the price. This tactic put a lot of pressure on me due to the fact that this left no negotiation which is what the reason for me delaying to buy the truck. After talks I agreed to their terms and would have all the repairs done before I took delivery However all I asked was if if they could a replace a manufacture step board (FORD) that had been broken. He explained that the company could not eat $800 and that the price was nonnegotiable. At this point i was so uncomfortable i wanted to get the deal over with. When I arrived home I went the the dealers website to grab the Vin for my insurance company.... my heart dropped when I saw that the price had been changed by $1000.00 lesser....after the dealer said the price would not and could not move. This just goes to show the amount of integrity this dealer has towards its customers. How can they say the price is nonnegotiable however the same day that I signed papers the vehicle price has dropped by $1000.00.  To me this is not right. This has taken money out of my wallet.  To those who are looking to buy from this dealer be very cautious. I would recommend if you are buying used to get your vehicle inspected by a third-party as they only do a 30 minute inspection before putting a vehicle for sale. Also do your due diligence and check their prices as often as possible, as you can see in my experience I signed for a vehicle that was less online the exact same day I bought it. I would hate for anyone to put their life in Jeopardy or be put in a financial bind due to the sales tactics of this dealership. Note: I addressed these concerns with an assistant manager and was told i would hear back from them to make things right. I have not heard anything....",1,591,Texas_without_threshold\Ford8 Reviews of Southway Ford.csv

The salesman explained that the additional cost was for the reconditioning fee for work they did on the car to get it ready to sell.  I can understand there being work that needs to be done on the cars and the dealership wanting to recoup that cost.  My issue is why not include that in the advertised price. When we asked our salesman about this he said that no dealership includes that extra cost in their advertised price and if Burleson Honda did no one would come look at their cars because they would be advertised for higher than other dealerships around. I don't know how accurate that statement is.  We felt very deceived.  The added amount took the price out of our budget.   After the back and forth drama that occurs in buying cars they did come down on their price some but we still paid about $2,000 over the advertised price.

3261,4,17-Feb-20,"I visited their dealership today and found my experience utterly disappointing.
I had interacted with your internet team and had got a valid quote for a car and also booked an appointment.
Since this was going to be my wife's car, I brought her and my 2 kids (1 infant) for confirming the deal.
When I reached there, I was asked to work with your salesman Melvin Jones. I was made to wait for a very long time and could view the car only after 90 minutes of coming.

I would have been fine with the delay had you guys been honest about your prices. I was looking for a 2019 Jeep renegade and got a confirmed quote (email) of $14300.  This was the first thing I told Melvin and was very clear about my ask. After 2.5 hours, Melvin started talking to us about the price. To my surprise, the price was now $17,800 because there was a mandatory security package that I had to take. When I told him that this is bait and switch as you are quoting a different value online which does not specify anything about this package he went in and sent an individual who seemed to be a ""manager"" of sorts. He tried to explain me that this was the correct price and that it still beats others. Although, this is not correct (There are other dealers who have it cheaper), this is not the point. You can not show a price, confirm in an email, invite the customer and then add a package and make it mandatory. Also, i was told that the only option i had was to finance my car (as against my choice of buying it outright). Again, this was not referenced anywhere on the website or email confirmation.

This is completely unacceptable and should be taken up by your management. If you guys pride yourself as an honest and fair company, these practices should not be followed.
As i write this letter, I can still see the $14,300 car on your website. You are not only losing 1 customer, but I will ensure that i speak about my experience within our community to educate them about such practices.

18831,1,03-Jan-20,"The Good:
The Peacock Nissan dealership is very nice on the inside.  The salesman than we initially worked with, Joel, was fantastic on our first visit.  We had an initial test drive that went swell, and was enough to convince us that a nice Rogue was a good fit for our needs.

The Bad:  
The problems came on our second visit.  We identified a certified preowned vehicle that fit our needs and was advertised at a reasonable price for its condition.  However, this is the time where potential buyers should be the most wary of the dealership.  When we sat down to negotiate with Mehdi aka Mike, we were ready for a lot of the type of car dealer tactics you read about, and they did not let us down - the 'let me check with my manager' spiel, leaving us to wait for long stretches....the ""this is the lowest i can go, or else i'd be fired!"" - only to then lower the price further, and so on.  Pretty much the stuff you'd see in any article about car buying and what to look out for.   The game is the game, so while we were annoyed by all this, it was not surprising.  Mike was pleasant to work with, and clearly had awards to show that he was at least decent at his job.

What WAS surprising however, was the price sheet with not just the so-called 'buy now' price, but: 
-a ""Market adjustment"" (that was explained as 3 different things by 3 different people)
    + additional ~$1800
-a 'certification fee' (which to be fair, we did encounter at another Nissan dealership, but was not explained as ""REQUIRED"" the way it was conveyed to us at Tom Peacock
     + additional ~$1200
-dealer add-on charges (that we were told we did NOT have the option to decline as they were ""already installed"") such as nitrogen tires, door guards, and GPS??
      + additional ~$1000 or so in total

PLUS the tax/title/license, for a grand total of almost an additional $5000 over the advertised price of the vehicle.   (This is the part in any advertisements where the fine print saying 'price does not include any dealer fees' comes in to play and what you should be VERY careful of.   We noticed that some other official Nissan dealerships were not nearly as bad about hidden fees, so maybe start with those first)

After much back and forth with Medhi, we agreed on a price that he even had the audacity to draw a line on paper and have me sign to signify that ""we have an agreement"".

At this point, we begin to fill out the finance paperwork, and are ready to go on to the finance manager and finish the purchase process.

BUT - plot twist!
Israel Aguilar, the pre-owned sales manager, comes in to the office to sit down and tell us that ""they made a mistake"" in the pricing that we had just spent 45 minutes working to get to an agreed-upon point on.  He then proceeds to go into a whole spiel about how he needs us to ""do him a favor"" and go up by $1000 on the price that we just settled on.  He goes on a bunch of platitudes about how it's only going to add a few bucks to my monthly payment, and we won't even notice it and he didn't want to lose his job either, and blah, blah.... it is interesting that he wanted us to believe that the $1000 was going to hurt the dealership more to honor their ""mistake"" than it would hurt an individual family's budget.

By this time, we had been in the office around an hour and a half with these gentlemen wasting our and their time, but as we were not willing to accept their bait and switch, we decided it best to leave before they came up with some new and imaginative way to try to deceive us.

And don't get me wrong - i understand that they're a business and have to make some money, but considering the reputation that car buying and car dealerships in general have for being slimy, bait & switch scam artists, you would think that in this age of SO many options for buying vehicles, a good dealership would try to differentiate themselves with honest, quality service...but here we are.

To add insult to injury, we had no fewer than 4 followup calls in the subsequent days:
-a call the next morning from a lady trying ""to understand what happened"":  she tried to convince me that the 'mistake' they made was them forgetting to mention the certification fee (which was a lie, since it was one of the things we negotiated over initially, so it *definitely* wasn't forgotten)

-calls/texts inquiring about 'what [they] could do to earn our business'  - the easy answer there would have been to either sell us the vehicle at the price we mutually agreed on, or train salespeople not to try to get customers to sign off on a bottom line price if they plan on asking for more later on!

-a call from the very first salesperson (Joel) asking if there were any other Rogues we might be interested in.   This call was part of the reason i had such a favorable opinion of Joel - at no point during the entire time we were in the dealership did either Mike or Isreal offer or suggest any similar cars that were available - instead, they fumbled the sale by trying to get us to go up after having already bait and switched the pricing up to that point.


Needless to say, we purchased the vehicle elsewhere.
The bottom line is, you can *possibly* get a good deal here, just be prepared to deal with a lot of BS and even then, they may try to pull shady tactics right before the finish line.    We anticipate having to replace our other family vehicle later this year, and this place will definitely be at the bottom of the list.

15759,2,31-Dec-19,"DO NOT BUY HERE!!!My wife and I came in to see a vehicle  that was published online as certified for $7,000 for our kids.  We dealt with a salesman who showed us the vehicle and allowed us to test drive it. Once we sat down to discuss the final price of the vehicle, we were advised by the salesman that the vehicle price was misprinted and the price was higher, but they would honor what was printed online.  Once the total numbers were put together, it was also advised that although the vehicle is described as certified it was an additional cost of $1,290 that I would be responsible for.  The total drive out on a $7,000 vehicle  was over $9,200.  This did not make sense.  I spoke with a manager and at advised him that the internet ad website for Beck & Masten Kia showed the vehicle at $7,000 certified. The manager stated that there are disclaimers on the website, and that they were not going to negotiate any further on the vehicle.  I then spoke with a general manager Mr. A. Khan.  He advised the same. at this point I explained that I would pay $8,000 drive out for the vehicle. Mr. Khan went and put some numbers together for me and the total was still over $9,200. He admitted that this is the mistake of the dealership and explained the dealership felt they were being fair since they were honoring the $7,000 price. Again, the price showed $7,000 and stated that the vehicle is certified pre-owned. I asked mr. Khan how he would feel if he was in my shoes, he attempted to work his way around a question and advised that advised that this is fair. Beck & Masten has been around for years.  My family has purchased a vehicle from them before many many years ago. This is a horrible way to conduct business.

I was hoping they'd give me a better ""deal"" than just $500 over KBB but would not and when the vehicle we originally wanted posted online was suddenly a higher amount then advertised the previous day they told us all their vehicles have about $3k in accessories on them and when we requested a vehicle without the additional they told us that wasn't possible and that it was online in the fine print. Thankfully we had a screenshot of the vehicle we were originally looking to trade up into and that's when the rest of the false advertisement and b.s. with it's all in the fine print. The way this dealership does business with false advertising vehicles for one price then providing way higher numbers after they get you in the door is bad business.

18081,16,13-Nov-19,"WORST experience EVER! (See Photos).I have not ever been so rudely disrespected. I'm still in shock!

Online I came across 2 Nissan Sentra S. A NEW 2019 for $15.5k & a USED 2019 grey/silver for $14k. My reservation was for Saturday 11/9/19 at 6pm. I went in around 1:30p. When I arrived; I was greeted by Rashad & his trainee.

I gave Rashad both ads from THEIR website. As we're going over features; the S model didn't have keyless entry, but SV model did. I was sold immediately (I had 0 desire for the drawn out 'test drive'). This is not my first time buying/trading a vehicle. I have my own APPROVED financing; all I needed was car info & final price. 

He comes back w/ the price marked up to $20.5k (CONVENIENTLY w/o $2.6k dealer discount), & only Nissan $2k rebate =18.5k but ADDS Wheel locks & Nitro-$599, EPP-$1,899, & Tint-$499=2,997. $22k BEFORE TTL! I'm NOT paying $3k for wheel locks on a Nissan, AIR in tires, a GLORIFIED wax/wash & a OVERPRICED window tint.

I kindly advised him that I didn't need nor want any of those things & showed him FOUR 2019 Nissan SV CURRENTLY listed on THEIR website for $15,681. Here is where things go downhill fast. Rashad leaves & a sales manager returns to reiterate the add ons come w/ it. If it 'comes' w/ it; it would be INCLUDED in the LISTING price. I leave telling him that if the car is not $15,681 w/ said 'add ons'; no deal.

I return a few hours later, they persisted w/ the add-ons & I left again. FACTORY made cars DON'T ""come"" w/ DEALER add-ons! They're ""dealer add-ons"" because the MANUFACTURER DOESN'T offer them as purchase options;otherwise you'd have to upgrade or wait for a CUSTOM made car..FROM the MANUFACTURER!!

Monday, I was still interested in the model & decided to reach out to the GM via reply email/# provided in a 'welcome' email. NO RESPONSE the ENTIRE day. Today, OC contacts me & during the conversation, I QUOTE VERBATIM, ""We do not have to list them."" YES YOU DO! If they are NOT listed as MANUFACTURE INCLUDED FEATURES they are OPTIONAL! It is in FACT ILLEGAL to NOT list them & force the charges to the customer! I then spoke to customer specialist Ashley. 3rd time is a charm, right?

I was UTTERLY & COMPLETELY WRONG. I get there & met Leo. He pulls my file & says the GM would come speak w/me. I was NOT met w/the GM (Chad Milow); instead it was a sales director, Roger. He shows me where they have marked the add-ons down to $400 (coincidence?). I tell him they have 16 Sentra SV on their lot. ONE of them is pure factory. He tells me no; which I know is a LIE. 16 customers added the EXACT same add-ons that were outsourced & DIDN'T purchase? Add-ons CANNOT be put on a FACTORY car until the car is SOLD! 

I call Nissan corporate to verify. He gets PISSED, SNATCHES the paper, walks off, & tells me to & I QUOTE VERBATIM ""Go purchase at the other dealership then! Why are you here?"" Excuse me?

I could not believe my eyes nor my ears! I politely walked to the front desk to ask his information. Leo returns & I explain to him what just happened, how rude & disrespectful that was. Leo tells me I can't call competition to ask about the same car & that the director doesn't want to 'deal w/ that'. Excuse me? The ONLY reason he doesn't want to deal w/ it because he KNEW he was LYING. As a BUSINESS you get customers by market competing! That is literally the model of business no matter what industry you are in!

I presume while I was headed home; they talked. Leo reached out & said they would do the deal if I accepted the numbers offered by the director. I told him I didn't get a clear look at everything, because the director snatched the paper so fast. NO RESPONSE. The ONLY way I would still purchase from here is IF I got the Sentra SV at listing price & a match on my trade-in.

Apex is an inventory management system created for car dealerships. They've just figured out a way to pass the cost onto unsuspecting buyers by packaging it as a high tech anti-theft system. What's worse is that Apex is used for target marketing. After you drive your car home, Apex tracks and sends mileage and other info to the dealer so their service department can send you advertising and coupons at just the right moment.

They tried to sell this to me on two different occasions. The first time, I told the salesman to take it off. He responded by offering me a ""great deal."" Since I didn't want it, he would take off $1,000 and just not activate the security monitoring. 

What a great deal - I'll pay you an extra $699 for an inactive GPS security system! What a joke.

The second time I tried to buy a car (different car, different salespeople) they tried to charge me $1500. I stuck to my guns.

They add in almost $1000 of extras, etching, windshield protection for 1 year and the ""elite package"" to protect the paint. This is a 2013 model used car to begin with.

1) The car (a 2017 Infiniti) was well-priced, but they wouldn't honor the price I agreed on with the Internet Mgr (they said ""Well that's the internet dept. We don't talk to them).  When I finally got it down, they tried to add on $1400+ in add-ons.  ""We can't remove them. All of our cars have them already installed). They are thiefs.
2) First of all, the car was not ready to be purchased: there were mulitple mechanical issues that would cost $500+ to fix. They acted like this was no big deal, and I should just buy it and drive a loaner home while they fixed the car. Wow. And they wouldn't even lower the price to make up for it.
4) The salesperson didn't know that the car had 2 accidents. The sales manager straight up lied to my face, telling me that they were extremely minor (they weren't) and that the CarFax was wrong when it said there were 2 previous owners.  I think they like to prey on stupid, uninformed car-buyers.
3) The salesperson said the car would be detailed and ready for our arrival. The car was filthy, inside and out (fast food garbage in the door sides and in the back) and it was completely out of gas. Extremely unprofessional.
4) The dealership is filthy. Old dirty stained chairs that felt gross to sit on.  No waiting area (in sales or service) for my kids to wait while I tried to buy the car.

I was in a car accident was rear ended and my car was totaled. Tom Peacock Nissan had a vehicle advertised online for 11,888.00. I went there and took a look at it and test drove it. This was 5 days after the accident. Now mind you I was in extreme pain, taking muscle relaxers and pain meds and still trying to work. They took advantage of me and counted on me to not notice what they had done. I paid $1000.00 down during the signing. And did not realize they had jacked up the financing price to over $13,000.00 then added their fee's and taxes which ended up totaling over $14,000.00. The car should have been financed for $10,888.00 then added the taxes and fee's. I spoke to them today about it and they refuse to do an amended finance and resubmit to the bank. Then on top of that they said for me to leave my car after signing papers so they could certify it. So I left it there and picked it up the next day. There was about 100 miles extra on the mileage from what it was the night before when they said to leave it. So I will be contacting the Federal Trades Commission and the Attorney General and getting a lawyer. They ripped me off of more that $3,000.00.  Please be ware of Tom Peacock Nissan on 45 North.

They wanted me to pay an additional $3k for dealer add ons (interior protection) AKA scotch guard that you can buy from any auto store or Walmart for under $10.00.  They also stated that because of the rebates they were losing money on the car.  Newsflash to those who may not know but dealerships get reimbursed for rebates so regardless of if they advertise a dollar amount in ""bonus cash"" the dealership will get paid for that from the manufacturer.  On top of the shady sales tactics the communication skills they have are horrible.  They hardly ever answer calls, texts, or emails.  My Sales Associate Savannah once told me she would call me back in 10 minutes.  36 hours later I still had not heard a peep.  And the management is of no assistance.  I tried reaching out to the GM Ryan Davis and sales manager Kenny Young just to see if I could get an associate that was not as busy and could return my calls but neither of them returned my messages.  I was willing to drive almost 4 hours for what I thought was going to be a great deal but let me save everyone some time.  DO NOT GO HERE!!!

THEN they tell me there's a problem, that there's a mistake on the price. They need to charge me another $1500 + $800 for their security package.

When we got to the dealership, we found they put a SECOND sticker on the car with another $1300 of dealer-added options, like paint and interior protection (which is invisible), tinted windows, nitrogen in the tires, and some insurance-like coverages, none of which we wanted.  These are all the things consumer groups have been telling people to avoid for decades, but this dealership is still doing all the same old unethical dealer tricks.  We drove around the lot in a golf cart for 15 minutes because the salesman couldn't find the car we came to see, and when we found it, it had a dead battery.  After dealing with 6 different salesmen and managers, we came to a deal on the car, which included a new battery to replace the dead one.  But before getting to a deal, we had to go through more of the same old dishonesty.  They told us they were selling us the car ""below cost"" and ""weren't making any money on it.""  Well, I must be the best negotiator in the history of the world because just about every car dealer for the last forty years has told me that.  When I asked what the $150 Document Fee was for, they ""didn't know"".  Just consider that at a wage of $20 per hour, that would pay for 7 1/2 hours of document preparation.  Ridiculous.  When we showed up at the agreed-upon time and day to get the car, they again couldn't find it and had done nothing to prepare it, including not having the new battery we agreed upon.

I went in and told the salesman no games, give me the final out the door cash price.
His manager came out and the price was $5000 more than the internet price. This was on a $11000 internet price on the car. The final price with TTL was $17k and some change!!!!!!

I drove down from Austin and drove (the car) Saturday. (The sales guy) takes my info to the finance folks and comes back with a quote that's $4K -- FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS -- more than the advertised price (which was only $17K to start). He says something about needing to maintain the vehicles and fine print on the website then asks what it would take to make a deal. I give him an OTD number about $500 less than advertised price, which -- stupid me -- I assumed that was a real price used as a start of negotiating. Sales guy is gone long enough, and I can see him wandering around in the finance office, that I think he's going to come back with final paperwork. Instead, it's just the same piece of paper with some new numbers that include a sales price that's still TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS more than list on both CarGurus and your website. I told him that was not acceptable, got up and walked out.

I looked at the fine print on their website and it mentions the typical TT&L, a negotiable fee of up to $115 and ""documentation charges"". All of that was listed on sales guy's paper separate from the sales prices of $4K and $2K above the advertised price. So where did those numbers come from and how do they relate to the advertised price?

I was told earlier that the web price was the best price. Clearly, that was not true. I would not have wasted three hours, including driving down and back, if I had known this was how the dealership treats its customers

2985,1,18-Feb-19,"Classic Chevy had contacted me around April 2018 regarding a vehicle and I did a test drive with one of their salesmen.  I decided to wait on buying. When I decided to purchase, I stopped at this dealership to do a 2nd test drive of the Chevy Equinox. That was 12/15/18.  This dealership had an Equinox in Kinetic Blue, with $17,998 in very large yellow numbers on the side of the vehicle.  The vehicle was up on a platform in the air so that everyone on the freeway could see it.  

Since the salesman that I dealt with in April had quit, in December I dealt with salesman, Sean Khwaja.  He said that Chevy was offering “Employee Pricing” on their vehicles, and this would drop the price even lower than the advertised $17,998.  I asked him to email me the following Monday with the price with the “Employee Pricing” discount.  

I did not hear from Mr. Khwaja, so on Tuesday, 12/19/18, I emailed him and asked him for the price with the ""Employee Pricing"" discount.    

Mr. Khwaja sent me a Purchase Agreement with a price of $24,953.22.   The advertised price of $17,998, that we had discussed, was not listed anywhere on the Purchase Agreement.   I told Mr. Khwaja that this was not the price that was advertised on the side of the vehicle.  

He said the $17,989 included rebates for things like Costco member, active military, National Realtors Assoc bonus cash, returning a lease, owner of a competitors vehicle, and USAA member bonus cash.  

I do not believe that Chevy’s available rebates added up to nearly $7,000.   Most of the offered rebates were only $500 each.  In addition, it is highly unlikely that any one person would qualify for every single one of the rebates.

I believe that advertising the price of this vehicle to the general public at $17,998 is deceptive pricing and/or false advertising since it includes rebates that they did not disclose when I was looking at the vehicle.  In addition, the dealership knows that it is unlikely that any person would qualify for every single one of the rebates they claim that they are deducting to come up with the $17,998 price.

Additionally, not knowing how to handle a transaction with an out-of-state customer with different numbers on different offers indicated the store employees were not trained in that area.

They (I believe Brittany) called me and ask when I wanted to come in and see it.  As I was talking to her she says they have the car priced wrong.  It is supposed to say ""call for pricing.""  And the reason it should say this, is because this dealership is asking $10,000 over msrp on the car.

When they brought it to me the wheel was warped. The tow truck.pulled it out of the parking space sideways. I was paralleled parked. They had the nerve to bring me back the car that the tire was warped and wobbled when I drove it also they stole my prescription sunglasses and cell phone out of the car.

12212,5,16-Nov-18,"I would NEVER set foot in the establishment again due to the BAIT and SWITCH tactics and complete lack of integrity displayed. I was first issued an online price quote on the vehicle that I was after. I drove the extra distance after work to view the vehicle and get everything set up. Once I arrived, I was informed that I had to use Hyundai Motor Financing in order to get the agreed upon price and the loan type was a balloon payment as well. I was not thrilled about this because I had already let him know I had financing approved at my credit union but I agreed that I would use their financing and went forward with the transaction. I agreed to return to the dealership in a few days to purchase the vehicle and once again drove out after work to complete the transaction. More BAIT and SWITCH from there. I was sitting in Randy Leyva's office, which overlooked the showroom floor that the car was sitting on. He sent the car back to have it prepped for the sale. After a while, Randy returned to his office with bad news. The car we agreed to just had a price hike of over 2K dollars. His reasoning was that it had a leather package installed and he wasn't aware of it. We went over the car with a fine tooth comb, I took pictures and we actually discussed how nice the leather seats were. It said in big bold letters LEATHER PACKAGE on the windshield and he must have walked past this car every day he worked since it was feet from his door. For him to claim he overlooked it was simply unbelievable.  He said he could get me another similar car without the leather which I rejected without hesitation. He knew he wasn't able to sell me the car for that price and yet he continued to waste my time bringing me into the dealership. Other reviews describe bait and switch tactics used at this dealership and I can you tell you first hand this is how they conducted our business. I was told I would receive two 50.00 gas cards for my troubles and almost three months later I have received nothing. I would steer clear of this place. Other dealerships should realize tactics like these are what give car dealers a bad name. Shamefully dishonest and a complete waste of my time!

3829,120,07-Nov-18,"I came to Gulfgate with my debit card out ready to purchase a vehicle.  After the test drive I was even more convinced to buy.  However, the price sheet brought back to me was roughly $3500 more than the price advertised online (which is why I came to your dealership...the advertised price).  Jaron explained the warranty that was added to the car, he also mentioned it was a way for the dealership to recoup some of the labor cost for prepping the vehicle.  After I told him I was not going to pay more than the advertised price, he got his manager.  His manager confirmed that he would not sell the car for less than the elevated warranty price.

After the director's departure, I continued discussions with Jaron, I expressed my displeasure of the bait and switch tactic.  Jaron began to tell me I was a bad consumer because if I didn't pay the elevated price I was preventing him from supporting his daughter.  This was the absolute worst sales tactic I have ever seen.

At this point I walked out of the Used Car building and went straight to NEw Car building asking for the GM.  I met a gentleman named, I believe his name was Carl, whom I explained my entire experience with.  HE left me for a minute, I assume to speak with Jaron and his team.

3283,3,27-Oct-18,"We had a really bad experience at this dealership. First, their Floor Sales Manager wouldn’t honor their own internet discount that was offered to me in-writing by their Internet Sales Manager. He tried to tell me it was already rolled into the sales price of the vehicle, then when he couldn't make the math work in their favor, it was quickly decided he “had already cut too deep into the price of the vehicle to allow the use of this discount.” Also, be careful of the $1,495.00 package they will tack onto your vehicle for interior Scotchgarde, paint sealant, tire locks, and VIN etching. This is not listed on their website and is added on when you are doing your final invoicing and it will not be optional. The same Sales Manager handling our deal told us “the car could not leave the lot without it.” Then, when I asked for him to provide, in-writing, what was a part of this package he told my wife and myself that “ALL new cars get it” and that “his Finance department was too busy to be bothered with providing it.” Once the deal was finally hammered out and I was given the aforementioned package for $700.00, which by the way was only VIN etching, there was no true delivery of the car; the make ready was so lackluster I had the local car wash down the street finish it a few days later and none of the car’s features were explained to me. Furthermore, when I asked for the spare keys and owner’s manuals, I was told I had to wait until my plates came in and at that time I would be given those items, per dealership policy. When I emailed the salesman about this he said he would check with his GM to see what he could do. I was allowed to drop by a couple days later and pick them up. Do not sign the delivery paperwork until you have truly taken delivery of the vehicle, thoroughly inspected your new purchase and are given a proper run through of all the vehicles features, even though they will try and have you do it beforehand.

At each point in this somewhat grueling negotiation I was left, like the sucker I was being taken for, to wait while ""Management discussed the deal"".

19150,17,01-Sep-18,"Throughout the entire process, they threw almost every devious used car scam at us. For anyone who is thinking of buying from this dealer, I kindly listed them all below with our experiences.

1.	Hiding add-ons in the Agreement
After test driving the vehicle I called Capital One to tell them which vehicle we chose so we could get approximate figures. They gave us everything we needed, including advice on what to look out for from the dealers. Feeling good about the process they described to us we go back to pick up the vehicle that we test drove 2 days before.

Manny (Salesman), upon getting our finance from Capital One paperwork, leaves and comes back with a short agreement detailing the sale and asked us to sign. I look it over carefully and see $389 for tint. What is this I ask, he said that if for the tint. I tell him that I don’t want tint I’m fine with what’s already on the vehicle. After unsuccessfully trying to convince me about this add-on, I tell him no deal and tell my wife let’s go. At this point, he goes into the dealership and before we pull off, the sales manager comes out and apologizes. He says, he is losing money on the deal and that was an add-in to offset his loss. REALLY… I told him that I was only paying for what was advertised online which was on the dealer sticker, nothing more – nothing less.
He tells us if he can get the bank to take back their banking fees (whatever that means) he would do the deal. So the waiting game began.

2.	Internet Low-Balling
The sales manager was insisting he was losing money on the deal due to the online advertising guys. I didn’t care either way. I just wanted them to honor what they had advertised and what I drove over 40 miles (twice) to get.

3.	Changing Figures in the Lease Agreement/ Focusing on the payment
After sitting for close to an hour, Manny comes up apologizing again about the tint and says we took the tint off, now you can sign. He throws in, “and we got it at the price you wanted with the monthly payments you had before”. Now, I’m really looking at it closely; and I see it. What they had done was taken the APR which was 12% and jacked it up to 15.9% somehow giving me close to the monthly payment but making the deal more expensive. REALLY!!! 

I ask Manny how many more tactics they were going to try. I told him to stop playing games before I leave. He apologized (AGAIN) and went back to the “Little Den of Thieves”. At this point, I’m wondering if it’s even worth it. But the deal that they advertised (that they were trying to renege on) was a good deal. I figured they just wouldn’t blatantly go back on the deal especially after being caught doing all the above; so I played the waiting game.

4.	Flat Out changing the window sticker
The dealer sticker clearly had the 90 day 100% warranty checked. When they bring the sticker to us to sign, it had “As Is” checked. I tell Manny, “Are ya’ll kidding me!” He assures me this was the original sticker and I vehemently tell him that it wasn’t. We go to John who now really kicks on with the “Good Guy – Bad Guy” act, he tells me this cannot be. He tells Manny to go back to where they cleaned the car to see if he could find the other sticker. Manny comes back with it all crumpled up and says it was in the trash, again apologizing to us. At this point, I’m ready to go, but John says ok, let me make this right, so we can get your business. We wait longer

5.	Good Guy – Bad Guy & Bait and Switch
After almost 4 hours John the sales manager comes over and says this deal is costing me too much, we’re not going to do it. I will sell you another car but not this one for that price. (Bait and Switch) Really!!!
I jump up and tell me wife let’s go and we leave. As we’re driving off, I look over and see her crying. I asked what’s wrong. She asks “Was it a bad deal?” I told her it wasn’t a bad deal, but it wasn’t the deal they advertised; I did not come to get a bad deal or even a fair deal, I came because it was presented as a Great Deal. 

6.	Packed payments
I guess a fair deal is better than a disappointed wife. I turned around and end up buying the vehicle for my wife, without the warranty that they initially advertised. They convinced me into buying their warranty and gap insurance. I had to wipe my hands on my shirt from all the Vaseline that I got on it by shaking their hand to seal the deal. I end up dropping the extended warranty and gap a week later after discovering how much I would end up paying them for the life of the loan. 

7.	Delay Tactics
Frustrated by a buying experience that was touted by their website as being “hassle-free”, “comfortable”, and with “no-pressure”, we ended up staying over 5 hours.

8.	Multiple Unauthorized pulls on Credit
We came in with APPROVED financing and told them, on more than one occasion, “Do not shop us to other finance companies”. 2 WEEKS AFTER PURCHASE WE GET MULTIPLE “WE’RE UNABLE TO APPROVE YOUR CREDIT APPLICATION LETTERS” FROM LENDERS. They did it anyway. Of course, our credit score has taken the hits. If you have read this far RUN FROM THESE GUYS!!!

18110,45,31-Aug-18,"False advertisement then bait and switch.  I made a trip to the dealership and picked out the truck I wanted a couple weeks before I was ready to buy.  When I was ready to buy I began negotiating over the phone as I live an hour from the dealership.  After several conversations about price I was eventually notified they add over $3000 in ""dealer add ons"".  They do not specify this on any of the websites they advertise on including their own website.  After further negotiations we finally agreed upon a price.  I filled out a credit app on their website for the truck I had picked out several days before making the hour drive to the dealership.  As soon as I arrive at the dealership the salesman and I start walking to the truck and he says ""you know this truck has 5000 miles on it correct""?  He took me to a truck I had never seen before that was a demo.  He obviously knew this was a different truck than we had been discussing.  They proceeded to try to charge me several thousand dollars more than what we had agreed to for the truck I had picked out.

23561,9,22-Aug-18,"Their sales process feels like a scam, smells like a scam and on top of that, they treat you like you are plain stupid, like they are doing you a favor!

We were ready to buy a new car. First, they dont tell you the exact numbers, we had to ask many times to be told what the exact interest rate was. Then, we run the numbers on a Volkswagen finance calculator and the rate they were applying was some 40% higher than the one we were being informed. That happened twice. I guess their finance people are really bad at their job or.... they think their customers are dumb.

Second, we were asking for specifics on the ""protection package"" that was part of the deal and they were doing all they could to not show us in clear terms what was covered. We were being coerced to sign the check for the down payment without seeing those details although we asked for those repeatedly from three different people. 

Third, and the last straw, the working paper with all the details on the deal showed the car had some 200 miles on it and when the final papers came, it had some 500. And we were sarcastically asked why we didnt check that by ourselves when we test drove the car! That's when we left.

17881,31,01-Aug-18,"This dealership is full of liars !  I dont even know where to begin.  Went in to purchase a 2018 Rogue.  The 1st time I was at the dealership I spoke with a lady salesman that was clueless.  even went as far as to tell me the extended warranty on Nissan cars was 5 yr/100 k miles.  That is even incorrect.  I ended up getting angry and leaving.  After I left I spoke with Brad Hawkins, he stated the lady was fired because she was dumb as a box of rocks.  The next time that I went into the dealership I took my husband in with me to purchase the car and bring it home with me.  We were at the dealership 3 hours and got absolutely nothing accomplished.  Finally Veronica stepped in and took the bull by the horns and started getting things taken care of.  When she brought us the preliminary paperwork on the car the sales price was like $2500 over the listed price on the internet. I told her that would not work.  Needless to say Alex (from finance ) came out and said for us to take car and come back in 2 days and he would have everything worked out and ready for us to sign.  Needless to say we had been there almost 3.5 hrs and my husband was about to explode.  I left with the car and kept calling Alex every 2 days and asking if he was ready for us to come sign papers.  He kept making up stupid excuses as to why he needed 2 more days.  Long story short, I called him on the 10th days (which happened to be 7/31/18) last day of the month.  He told me to come on there and he would go over everything with us and close the deal.  We went up to the dealership after we got off work.  The real ""xxxx show"" began !  The problems started when we FINALLY got in the finance office.  They are only willing to put the car (which mind you I have racked up 1000 miles on and have drove for 10 days ) in my husbands name.  I had asked Alex the specific question 10 days prior if the car would be listed in both our names and he said yes.  That was the 1st lie !!  Then he got the sale price listed to 22k when there are SEVERAL Rogue's like mine on their internet for sale for 21k.  When I questioned Alex REPEATEDLY about the internet price, he came up with some xxxxxxxx on a computer screen that showed they are losing like $2500 on this deal just to make me happy.  I told him he was full of xxxx and I was not happy !   He came out with some xxxxxxxx about the Nissan Customer Cash ($2000) and Rogue Bonus Cash ($500 that was listed on the internet.  He said I didnt qualify for that because I didnt finance thru Nissan.  He is a LIAR !!!  The internet even list the ""cash price"" as 21k.  After arguing with him about it till I was blue in the face, Alex refused to change the price to match their listed price on the internet.  After my husband finished signing all the papers he came outside to the car.  They sent another salesman out to see If I had any questions about the car.  I told him I had been driving the dang thing for 10 days already  and that I had no questions and was just ready to get the xxxx out of their !  They only have given me 1 key to the car, they have seemed to have lost the other !!!   IDIOTS !!!!   In the process of all this happening, another  salesman walks out and starts talking to the man that I had just went off on.  They start starring at me talking.  That was rude as xxxx and made me even madder.  I walked up to him asking if he had something to say to my face about me.  He started to ramble some xxxxxxxx !!!   I am done with this dealership !

 We notified him that we were interested in the truck but that we had seen one similar closer to home, the difference was the color. (My husband didn't like the color of the truck that was closer to home) but that truck was $1000 cheaper. We asked the sales representative if they could offer us a good enough deal to make the drive to kingsville. We live in mission texas so the drive is about an 1hr and 45 minutes. We made it very clear that we would make the drive only if they could work on lowering the price a little bit.  The sales person assured us that his sales manager could make that happen. So we make the almost 2 hour drive to kingsville to find ourselves looking at an increase on price, AN INCREASE ON THE PRICE OF THE TRUCK!!! I was blown away, I had never in my life delt with a dealership who advertised a price to only change once they got the customer in. As you can understand I was completely thrown off by the new charges. The sales rep then proceeded to explain to me what those were.  A charge for a number engraved  in the glass and a paint coat.  THOSE CHARGES WERE NOT CLEARLY IDENTIFIED OR ADVERTISED ON THE WEBSITE.  yes in small print it did say, in a very generic tone,  that some vehicles might have extra chargers, but I thought, like any other normal customer,  that those fees would be taxes and title or a warranty or something like that.

I showed the listing I found on CarGurus advertising the price of $28,294. I did some math and gave an offer I felt was extremely fair (~100 dollars off the drive out price). 

The manager (Todd) comes in to discuss the deal. The offer he laid out listed the price at $30,544 (before TTL). I told him this was not the price I saw on CarGurus. He retorts that he does not advertise on Cargurus and car gurus lists cars from their inventory just to bloat their inventory advertised. Okay. I was in front of him and pulled up the AutoNation Dodge website and see the exact car listed at $28,294. His response? ""Oh that's the purchase price, not the lease price. If you did your homework you would obviously know."" Okay, if that's the case, why not say that from the beginning? That the price of $28,294 was for financing and not leasing. His lack of manners, condescending attitude stemmed from how little he knew and how much he underestimated me. It would've saved 10 minutes of conversation had he explained that in the beginning. Instead, he goes on to brag about how he as a sales manager moves 500 cars a month 

Long story short, they lost a deal. Misleading on the price of the vehicle, getting aggressive and argumentative when that was unnecessary, and last, because the sales managers arrogance and snarky behavior as disgusting as it was, could not overshadow how sleazy he was and how sleazy he runs this dealership.

8231,46,29-Jan-18,"Seriously worst dealership I ever had to deal with! I know going to a dealership is usually not a fun experience and they all want to get as much money out of you as possible but this place is by far the worst. First off they put amazing prices on their website for vehicles and once you call or actually go to the dealership to check it out the car is either "" just sold this past week"" or they will make up a fee and add a ridiculous amount of money to it. Oh and if your wanting to trade your car in, don't expect to get anything Kelly Blue Book, NADA, or any other online website thinks the trade in value is. Apparently they just make their own price up for that too. So, I went in there to take a look at a new 2018 mustang and trade my 2014 mustang in which has 55,000 miles, only been washed by hand, only used royal purple oil for oil changes, and I put close to $1,000 into it putting custom leather seat covers in it, adding weather tech floor mats, and tinted the windows with a lifetime guarantee. They wanted to give me $8,500 for trading it in. I told the sales rep I looked it up on Kelly Blue Book and it says the trade in value is $11,059 not including the money I put in it. He said KBB is a western company and that they use NADA. So, I looked up the NADA trade in value. The NADA clean trade in value is $11,575. Then, I was talking to a sales manager trying to negotiate a price and I told him about the NADA trade in value, and no joke he tells me they don’t use NADA to look at trade in values, they use this other website. I can’t remember what that site was called. To make this story short, we couldn't come to agreement on the trade in or the final price of the car. Two days later, I look online and find a New 2018 Ford Raptor at the same dealership for $51,080. Amazing price right! So when I called them and tried to see if they still have it in stock and see what the price was, the person I talked to said there was not any sale reps in the dealership at the moment and they would call me back as soon as one comes in. This was at 8:15 am they open at 7:00 am. That seemed kind of fishy to me.  So I had a friend of mine call them 5 minutes later, and guess who answers, a sales rep. He told my friend the vehicle is in stock, but you need to add a $10,000 fee to the MSRP sticker price, so the final price is $61,000. 45 minutes later a female sales rep gave me a call. This sales rep said the vehicle is in stock but you have to add $15,000 to the MSRP sticker price. I said why do you have to add $15,000? And no lie, she stuttered and actually took a while to come up with an excuse as to why they add that much to it. She then asked me if I wanted to come see it and I said I only wanted to come see it if I can get it for the price you advertised on your website. She then said, “Ya we can’t sell it to you for that price"". I then texted the sticker for the vehicle to the sales rep I talked to about the mustang. He texted me back saying, ""yes that vehicle is in stock"". I then texted him if he wanted to sell a truck today and sell me for the price on their website and on the sticker then I will come up there and purchase it that day. You probably guessed it he never texted me back. So if you want some advice, I would not go to this dealership. All they do is play games, make up numbers, and try to screw people over. If you see a good price online for this dealership just add a minimum of $10,000 to it and that’s the real price. Also, I would never trade my car into this place.

We are very happy with the Pre-owned vehicle at the price we got it for but not happy with the customer service that we experienced with the managing staff.

17661,20,16-Sep-17," Made the mistake of purchasing a vehicle for my daughter from this place. Huge mistake. 
I went back and forth with salesman about the price we agreed on through email. While he kept insisting I purchase a warranty for an additional 1800 dollars. I refused several times and he kept lowering the price of the warranty. After I refused for the last time he said I would have to pay sticker price because the price we negotiated had expired because I did not come in the same day. I told him I would take the car without the warranty and pay the 250 dollar discount he said expired. I also said I would give him a bad review. He came back said he would give it to me at the price we had previously agreed. By this time it's well after closing. I'm angry and tired. The finance manager reassured me that he would take care of me and apologized. Finally I thought a decent person in this place. I made the mistake of not thoroughly reading through the contract because by this time it's well after 10 and I was exhausted. I read through my contract when I get it in the mail and lo and behold, the 1800 dollar warranty was added along with the 250 dollars to the price. I was also told I would get an additional key for the vehicle but when I went back they said they didn't have it. 
I should have been thorough when reading my contract but I really thought the finance manager was honest and doing the right thing when he said he would take care of  the problem.

18794,16,14-Sep-17,"Sales person I worked with at this dealership completely misrepresented the 2012 Armada I went to inspect.  A vehicle he told me that was owned by the dealership-owner, himself.  

I flew in from Kansas City to purchase the SUV with only 21,000 miles, that sales person said was in excellent condition. I was very specific. I don't want to see a door ding, a scratch - anything at all.   

I am very particular (relayed many times to the salesperson), and he assured me that the vehicle was in fantastic shape.  I was also pinning my reliance on the condition on the fact that, hey, this is the owner of the dealership's car!  It should be perfect...   

Prior to arriving, they wanted to charge me additional for tinting (already completed and not included in advertised price) and some kind of bio-clean... together, another charge of almost $1000 - added onto the price advertised.  I should have been wary right then...   

Upon arriving, every bit of trim on the vehicle was corroded, with pockmarks and discoloration due to some unknown cause - possibly salt from Colorado where he had it titled.  There were also scratches most of the way down the passenger side.  The only photos they had sent me to that point,  since the car was a new listing, were the salesperson's phone photos of the car with poor resolution.  

When I pointed out the obvious problems with the chrome trim/wheels, I was told that he thought 'it looked good for its age', but he then reversed and said that it was priced for the adverse condition.  The scratches he said 'could be buffed out'; then, why weren't they just buffed out!? What a load of...  

Manager tried to help, but the corroded, chrome trim and wheels needing replacement were appx $4500 for the parts alone, not including labor.  He tried to explain to me that I was still getting a good deal if they just added these part's costs to the vehicles advertised price.  Thanks, but no thanks.  

They even offered another vehicle that was  similar and on their lot. But, they would not even provide me any pricing information until I drove it!???

Please know however.  I was very nice/patient, but firm, the entire time.  I was just really, really disappointed. 

No offer of ride to/from the airport, soda/water.... anything.... after I spent almost $400 to get there in flight and overnight hotel, just to be  severely let down.  Then, I had to purchase the additional flight back at almost $300. 
Total of $700 and two of my days - wasted!

My opinion:  This dealership should have specific people who handle internet sales on used cars/trucks with out-of-town buyers and vehicles purchased for delivery out of state w/o an inspection.  These persons should have impeccable honesty and be absolutely forthright - with detailed pictures of the shortcomings as well as the good.

Please read all reviews of this dealership before wasting your time. I have purchased 3 new Fords over the past 10 years and this is by far the worst experience I have ever had. The dealership is run by Kent Hobelman and it appears that he has trained his staff to employ every under handed tactic synonymous with car dealerships. 

If you are expecting to walk in find the vehicle you were told is in stock - Wrong!

If you are expecting not to go through a 5 hour grind - Wrong! 

If you are expecting them to honor a price that they agreed to over the phone - Wrong! 

If you are expecting that they will not use your trade in vehicle hostage to keep you from leaving - Wrong! 

If you are expecting to find the price of the vehicle to adhere to the viewable window sticker you saw on the internet without insane dealer add on like ""Shark Repellant Spray"" or ""Super Duper Fabric Protector"" - Wrong! 

All in all, this dealership is a  semen stain to the Ford name and is a disservice to loyal clients and until Ford realizes this and puts people like Kent Hobelman back into the petri dish he came out of, they will continue to lose market share.

Saw a great price for a used vehicle, called to verify it was at the dealer and already over the phone in my first interaction with the sales person wanting to find out if it was a ""done deal"" even though I hadn't physically seen the car or driven it. Appointment time was set and when I arrive, the sales person is nowhere to be seen and other sales people tell me he is ""at lunch"" despite knowing they had an appointment. We wait 20 minutes and when I inform him he was late for his appointment, he laughs as if its a joke. Fast forward past the vehicle inspection (the car was incredibly dirty despite being at the dealer for over 2 months now), I am informed that they can't honor the price that was advertised on their website because that is no longer what was being listed. Classic bait and switch. Expecting this, since I had informed the sales person of the discrepancies on various websites, the website ads disappeared but not before screen shots and links were saved. I produced printouts of everything I saw, gave them direct links (that no longer worked) and best of all, Google had cached the websites with the low price clearly displayed on the vehicle in question, complete with the exact description and VIN number. The sales person also handed me a newspaper and said that that was the ad they ran just before the car went to another dealer (before returning when I requested it). He said it was from a week prior. When I flipped the paper over, the very top of the newspaper clearly displayed the date from the day before my visit, not the week before.

The manager showed a clear lack of understanding on how the internet works and tried to blame google for changing the price. At one point, he even tries to say that this price never appeared on their website and that it has to be faked by google. Seriously. I wish I could've made that up. Eventually, they caved and were willing to sell the car at the price advertised but immediately balked when I said I would pay in cash and not finance. It didn't matter anyway because I did not plan to do business with them. It was very obvious from the start when the sales person was ""at lunch"" that this dealer is sleazy. They could not deal with the fact that I was so prepared for their obvious tricks. If you are an informed buyer, go somewhere else. These people are not honest at all.

I purposely waiting to write my review until I was able to look over all the paperwork away from the dealer and let the dust settle if you will. Here is what I learned from this particular dealer and purchase. Now some of this can be on me for not paying closer attention when dealing with finance manager however if you have bought a car then you know paper is flying when you get to the finance manager. So here are my thoughts.
1. Make sure you are dealing on final price not the monthly payment. They will sneak in things if you are dealing on monthly payment and not bottom line price. (example when I looked at my paperwork I was charged $895 more than what the vehicle was advertised on the internet. More on this in a bit.
2. Make sure if they over you a perk (warranty, service package, ect...) you get it on there ""WE OWE"" form. If you don't get this info on this form and ask for a copy before going to finance you will be charged for it (as I was) when you think the dealer is picking this up for you.
3. Do not buy GAP insurance through this dealer. They charged me $995 and I later found it priced at $395. They WILL triple charge you on GAP. Also pay attention to the rate they offer you if you finance through the dealership as well as it will be higher than what you can actually qualify for by getting your own financing. 
I was hit with all of this from this dealer and although you can go home and study what they burned you on and then go back and cancel within 30 days you still feel taken advantage of. When I returned to this dealer in person to cancel my extended warranty which I was told they were going to pay for (Pay attention to that ""WE OWE"" Form), and to cancel my service agreement which I never signed for but they stated was including with this purchase all i had to do was bring it to their dealership for service (oil changes, tire rotation ect...). I ended up canceling over 3K in warranties, service plan, and gap insurance. So back to the $850 charge that was added to my vehicles advertised priced. When I tried to recoup this or ask about it I was told this is a charge added to price on all used vehicles for reconditioning fee. Cleaning, balancing tires, ect... This is mainly for used cars as the new cars will have this shown on the sticker.  So this $895 I have yet to get back however I am not going to give up. So once again ask what the final price of this vehicle is before going to finance.

12508,12,24-Jun-17,"Here is what happened to me during my purchase of a 2017 Hyundai Sonata at World Car Hyundai in San Antonio, TX. After reading this you should understand why I scored the survey as I did.  On Saturday June 10th my wife and I visited the dealership looking for a 2017 Hyundai Sonata Limited. The sales person greeted us and showed us what was available on the lot. I had gone through Truecar and this is what led me to this dealership. There weren’t a lot of choices available on the Limited model in San Antonio. We found the 2017 Hyundai Sonata Limited 2.0 Turbo and test drove it. We liked the vehicle very much and decided to go forward with the purchase. During the negotiations the dealership presented a price and ultimately we decided on a price $500 less. Everything was set. I was going to pay cash but was told I could save more money if I financed with Hyundai so I did. From the time we agree on a price to the time I actually got the vehicle took approximately 4 hours. Seemed like forever. The financing when through just fine. We scheduled an appointment to have the appearance package added to the vehicle the next week. We drove the vehicle home and thought everything was good.   Three days later I get a call from the finance guy saying I added the wrong vehicle to my insurance. The VIN on the vehicle from the ID card they have does not match what they sold me. I verified that the VIN on the ID card is indeed the vehicle they sold me. Then the finance guy realized they screwed up and did the whole deal on the wrong vehicle. He said I would need to sign all new paperwork. I agree to meet him at a Starbucks halfway between my house and the dealership and sign the correct paperwork. I met him and while I was going through the new paperwork when I can to the document with the total purchase price I noticed the price had increased by $2600. He did NOT tell me this, I’m the one that pointed it out. I said we have a problem. This is not the price we negotiated. He said he understood but the price we negotiated was on a different vehicle. I said that was not my fault. I test drove the vehicle I wanted. And in good faith negotiated the price on that vehicle. He said I would have to drive back to the dealership and speak to the sales manager.   I drove all the way back to the dealership. Spoke with the sales manager and he said the only thing they can do is reduce the price by $500. I said that was unacceptable. They should give me the price we negotiated. It was not my fault that they used pricing on a different vehicle. He accused me of wanting free money. I requested to speak with the General Manager. Gave him my story and he agree to give me $1200 off but not the full $2600 price increase. This whole time neither the Sales Manager or General Manager EVER ONCE apologized to me for what was happening. The salesman we had (Andy Bailey) did apologize but he was the only one. I was in a dilemma. On one hand I wanted to scrape the whole deal and get my trade-in back. But we had the new vehicle for 3 days and I had no idea what had happened to my trade-in. Plus we had been looking for a new vehicle for awhile and had gone to a few dealerships and was so ready for the process to be over.   All said and done, they agree to reduce the total to $1500, but not the full $2600. I agree because I just wanted it to be over. I still feel this was wrong. I believe that World Car should have stood on THEIR mistake and compensated me financially as well as ALL the time it took doing this. They were completely unprofessional (again not Andy Bailey the salesman).   So the next week I take the vehicle in for the appearance package (on a Friday). Was told I would get it back the same day. I got it late the next day and there were scratches on the driver and passenger side window tents which the service guy pointed out to me. So  we set up ANOTHER appointment. I went back the next week and got the windows redone.   All told, I have been to World Car Hyundai 5 times in two weeks. I live 20 miles away.   This is why I scored the survey as I did.

11102,7,12-Jun-17,"Lies! Sure, Google Reviews show good ratings. Try venturing out to Yelp and other sources before you show up to this place. I read about all of the additional fees you incur when purchasing a used vehicle so I decided to reach out to a sales rep to determine the price of the vehicle. I specifically mentioned the reviews and asked for the final price due to finding such reviews. Bruce Paiva did not give me the price of the vehicle but reassured me he was the guy to buy a vehicle from... He told me to check the reviews of him from the Gillman Honda site. So he sent me a message and said ""I'll make sure you get the tax title and license for free AND take $1300 off the vehicle. "" (SEE PICTURES). So, I drove to SA from Austin, he didn't even meet me, he his 'associate' meet me. Even after he said the time I proposed was fine and that he was the person to buy from. Mimi, the associate was friendly. I enjoyed chatting with her but it came down the cost of the vehicle, already priced above book then you add almost 2k in fees for the dealership. I know buying a car is more expensive at a dealership than private party. HOWEVER, I only made the drive due to the conversation with Bruce. The price of the vehicle ended up being 2k more than sticker price. Mimi said they don't list the out the door price or straight up inform you because then no one would come in see them. So, apparently once you fall in love with the vehicle they hope you will pay 2-4k or maybe even more on some vehicles more than their worth, even a 2012-2013 vehicle. I showed Mimi the texts on my phone and she said there was no way that's what he meant. I left and then Bruce messaged me and said ""I heard you want to not getting the car...I told you we could get you $1300 off the vehicle not 3 thousand."" His misuse of words/grammar not my typing. [see pics]. So, to get this straight, the fees and taxes ARE NOT part of the cost of the vehicle itself. In his text he said I'll make sure you get the TAX, TITLE, and LICENSE FOR FREE ANDDD take $1300 off the vehicle. If you're looking at a vehicle online and come across this review, I really hope you think twice or go in knowing you're going to pay 2k more than sticker price, which most vehicles are already significantly marked up.

17908,58,05-Jun-17,"No wonder they are one of the lowest rated dealerships in the area. I wish i would have looked prior to this ordeal.  

I found the car I wanted on the internet and told them I would be in later that evening to test drive.  I received 3 phone calls in 3 hours making sure I was coming in.  I did show up for the test drive and told them I wanted the vehicle and scheduled time to bring my trade in back the next day.  I received multiple phone that day to make sure I was going to be in.  

I brought my car in and after they had time to appraise it, they immediately started with the sales manager, Ray, and the hard sell.  My first issue was the price of the vehicle was over $2000 more than the price listed on their Web Site.  Ray said this is because the car was ""certified"" and they was his cost.  But the web site has a different price.  The price i was quoted two days before when I test drove it was the same as the Web Site.   NOTE - At this point one should walk out.  I eventually worked out a deal, if they agreed to guaranty the battery - it was a full electric car.  This was actually written on the document i signed to get the deal.  A document that is now nowhere to be found.  NOTE - Ask for a copy of all paperwork.  
The store does not stop there.  They messed up the paperwork and had to send me new documents to sign.  Again I received multiple calls asking if I had the paperwork and if i was sending it back that day.  NOTE - Once you sign the paperwork - and the check, they don't care.  Next step was trying to get them to pay off my trade in.  My check was deposited in 1 day.  My trading, 3 weeks and multiple phone calls later.  
They still have not delivered what they said they would.  They have their money and don't care.   ",1.2,1058,Texas_without_threshold\Nissan114 Reviews of Clay Cooley Nissan.csv
17990,2,04-Jun-17,"Would not recommend this dealership - very distasteful sales strategies including bait and switch on sales pricing, lies about rebates and interest amounts, and classless comments about your trade-in.
1.	Bait and switch – the listing for the 2017 Nissan Rogue we recently purchased was $23,500 (after rebates). When we were shown the vehicle, again, the sales woman indicated the price of the vehicle to be $23,500. Once the offer was presented, the vehicle was now $24,500 due to a mandatory $999 Texas Protection Package that was already ‘part of the vehicle’ per the sales manager. This practice is complete bait and switch. We refused to pay for this, but the sales manager stated it was part of the vehicle and a mandatory part of the price. 
2.	The sales manager lied to us about the rebate deadline. The sales manager informed us that the rebates being offered expired at midnight that day(May 31st). The reality was that the rebates being offered did not expire at midnight, but were instead available thru June 5th.
3.	The sales manager lied to us about the interest we would be paying on the vehicle. The sales manager informed us that over the first 6-months of the loan, we would ‘only pay a couple hundred dollars in interest.’ The facts of the matter, we are scheduled to pay $500+ in interest over the first 6-months of the loan (4.5% interest rate despite excellent credit).
4.	We inquired several times for the interest vs. principal breakdown of our monthly payments (essentially an amortization table). We were passed from the sales woman we were working with to two other individuals who would not provide the breakdown, and eventually passed to the sales manager who would also not provide this detail (instead, simply stating that we would ‘only pay a couple hundred dollars of interest’ over the first 6-months’). At no point would they provide specifics beyond 5-year total interest at the very end of a very long process.
5.	Upon trading in our vehicle, the sales manager told us we were lucky to be getting $1,000 in trade-in value. He stated ‘your car is junk with over 200,000 miles. It will go straight to our dump the second you walk out of here.’ This was simply a classless comment. Also quite interesting given less than 4-days later our vehicle was listed on their website for nearly $3,000.

I reminded him that he had also sent me a text message telling me that he had gotten the agreed on drive out price approved by his Sales Manager. He again stated, ""they are re-running the numbers and I cant sell the car for that."" This entire incident has been reported to Nissan Consumer Affairs.

Good afternoon Mr. xxxxxx,
 
This is Jerrell Price from Central Houston Nissan, we spoke earlier today on the phone.  I apologize for the delay but I was making sure we found the right vehicle with the features you are looking for.  I need to ask you a few questions about the Altima you're looking for.  Did you want the Technology package on the vehicle?  If so, I have one in pearl white.  The invoice price which is the price the dealership owns the car for is $34,034. The MSRP is $35,895 plus tax title and license. I can sell you the vehicle at the invoice price of $34,700 minus the rebates which is $3,000 bringing the vehicle price down to $31,700 plus your tax, title, and license.  In this situation I want to earn your business and take care of our law enforcement.  Down worry about the price of the tax, title, and license.  For you it will just be $31,700 drive out.  If you want the Altima SL without the Technology package, then your drive out will be $30,656.  It was a pleasure speaking with you earlier.  Give me a call and let me know what I can do to earn your business.

10240,42,31-May-17,"After seeing a great price on an internet advertisement for an F150 truck, I called and spoke with a salesman to confirm the inventory was available at the stated internet price before visiting and they said yes. I test drove and was then told of $1,800 of dealer add-ons (unadvertised) that I would have to pay for and they would only do the deal if I took a low ball price on a trade-in.. When I asked them to remove the trade-in from negotiations, they actually refused to do the deal altogether unless I traded in because they would lose money at their advertised price plus the $1,800.  They played all sorts of games (back to the manager 4 times) that I thought dealers gave up in the dark ages. I guess they thought we had spent so much time we would not go elsewhere.

Then they had the gall to say all dealers do the same thing and include unadvertised add-ons like they do.

That was the biggest lie. We went to Covert at 183 and got a price less than Maxwells advertised teaser price (with the $1,800 dealer add-ons). No games (back and forth to the manager). Picked our truck and closed the deal in 90 minutes.

Not needing a new car immediately has given me the luxury of taking my time and shopping around. I've had my eye on a new Ford Focus hatchback and did my research on features, pricing, etc. Covered all the bases. I found the perfect model on the Covert Ford website which listed the selling price as $17,777. The price was great, and I, not having purchased a new vehicle in some time, assumed I had just lucked out and stumbled upon a sale. I visited the dealership today and worked with Manny, who was polite and helpful. I have no issues with him. However, I did confirm the selling price several times and brought in a print out from the website clearly showing the listed price. I test drove the car, provided evidence of pre-approved financing, and we agreed on a price and monthly payments. They took my current car for appraisal and I signed an agreement stating I would purchase the new car today based on an anticipated appraisal estimate. This paper also listed the selling price of the new car as $17777. But then Manny came back and told me that the Internet Manager had ""fixed"" the price online. He had also scratched out the agreed upon price he wrote on the appraisal agreement and listed another. Apparently, the previous Internet Manager made a lot of mistakes and the price would actually be $3000 more than originally listed. They refused to honor the price that was listed when I came in. Yes, they literally raised the price $3000 two hours into the buying process. I understand mistakes happen. However, if you make the mistake, you take the loss. Period. This felt like a bait and switch, and was, frankly, insulting. Could I have looked at another model with a lower price? Sure. Could I have just agreed to the higher price? Sure. But this experience left such a bad taste in my mouth, I couldn't bring myself to buy any car at Covert Ford, ever. Incompetence is not something I can get over in a situation where I'm about to sign a contract and spend thousands of dollars. Listing one price and then demanding another, crying, ""Whoops! Our bad!"" is beyond incompetence. It is unethical, it is deceitful, and it is devious. Shame on you, Covert Ford.

Unethical to say the least. The first question I had was ""do you honor the Nissan VPP price""? The answer? ""I talked to my manager and yes, we do"".

While driving up, we re-called to double check, this is the price, no extra fees, add ons, etc? Yes, that's the final price he said.
Drive an hour up there and after a bunch of waiting and usual car sales delays, all of a sudden price is around $2k more and nothing they can do to lower. Hours wasted.

8907,13,13-Feb-17,"Was shopping for a Ford Escape for my wife. Saw a good deal listed on their website for a 2017 Ford Escape with all the options we wanted.

Showed up at dealer and dealt with Tillman Walker. Test drove the vehicle liked it and proceeded inside to make a deal. 

Told the salesman we were pre-approved with our credit union for a certain amount which was a little less than the sales price. He came back with a figure way more than the internet sales price. Physically showed him the price listed on their website and was told it was a mistake and couldn't honor the price (Tillman is listed as a Internet Salesman on their website). The price hadn't been corrected for two weeks following our visit. 

He then told us they could do better incentives if financed through ford. We went through the whole shady dealer 4 square crap of tell us what you want for payments (While they make up for it with a trade in or crappy financing). All in all Tillman was nice and polite even if he didn't listen. 

They also undervalued my wife's trade-in by thousands. He had the nerve to tell us that KBB is not a reliable method of determining a trade-in value. That is kinda what blue book value is for. We ended up taking the trade in to Carmax and got a few hundred dollars better then KBB value.

We ended leaving after wasting more than FOUR hours of our time. Had they just said they couldn't meet our pricing request we would have walked out and not wasted our time. 

Later that week he called me and said he wanted to make a deal and would get me their best pricing. After waiting several hours I called back (was told it would take less than an hour). Their offer was still barely better than MSRP and not what their advertised pricing was.

Got called several weeks later right after I bought a new 2016 escape for what I was willing to pay. He said they would try to work something out on the price. I'm sorry but if you want to make a deal just give people a good offer and honor your advertised pricing. You could have saved us and yourself a lot of wasted time.

I would not send my worst enemy to this dealer to buy anything. They don't honor internet pricing, practice shady sales techniques, have dealer add on fees for crap nobody needs, and will just plain waste your time.

And the manager that had initially agreed to the deal has left the dealership. The general manager's rationalization was ""why didn't you buy the car at that time? Mazda promotions change all the time and we cannot honor the previous agreed upon price."" He completely ignored the fact that cost change is due largely to this ""complimentary"" package.

18150,85,09-Feb-17,"We had a HORRIBLE experience at the Central Houston Nissan dealership. If I could give a zero star I would. This place does not sell cars, it is a place that lies to the customer. They will try their best to trick you into paying more money for the price of the car than you agree to.

We were interested in one car, and the manager agreed to a total price of $23,800 drive out (which included tax, license, documentary charge and fees). But when they did the paperwork, the finance person added an extra $ 1,429.28 which was never acknowledged by us and meanwhile he offered several additional warranties to let us buy, to draw our attention away from this extra charge.


The following is what we are agreed to for pricing
Drive out (including tax, license, documentary charge and fees)	$23,977.19 
trade in car	($7,800)
Extend service	$926 
Maintenance package	$480 
Rebate (this rebate is 
promotion for use finance service) 	($1,500)
 Total finance	$16,083.19 


The following is what the dealership charged us 
sale price(should have included tax, license, documentary charge and fees but did not)	$23,977.19 
Theft protection	$100 
trade in car	($7,800)
sale tax	$923.57

Total finance	$17,512.47 

Since we had our two year old son with us, my husband and I had to alternate talking to the finance person which he took advantage of.  He never showed us a detailed breakdown of the charges. He just told me that my husband could sign the paperwork when he brought my son back from the  restroom. Because we had a trade in car, had some financing, and bought some additional warranties, and had up to a $1500 rebate, my husband was unable to calculate an exact number so he truly believed the finance person. Although, he didn't show us any paper work or explain in any detail for the charges and just rushed my husband to sign the paperwork.  

After my husband signed the paper work and drove the new car home, we found one indicator light was on, then I asked  to have it checked out. I obviously couldn't buy a brand new car that already had problems. But the salesman just told us to drive a little longer and the light would go away, but it never went off. 

We went home to have dinner and this was when we realized that the invoice amount they charged was not what they told us. My husband immediately went  back to dealership to ask for a refund of the additional charge and they told him their boss was not there now but they would  give us back at least $500 on Monday, which was the next  business day. 

But on Monday, when my husband contacted them they rejected to refund the overcharge amount and said your wife agreed to pay this amount. This is such a big lie. They never showed any paper work to me. I only asked the finance person why they offered 0 percent financial rates and still charge 3.99% of interest rate to us?  Then the finance person said either you can chose $1500 rebate with 3.99% rate or no rebate with 0 % interest rate. The finance person also suggested we choose the $1,500 rebate with 3.99% than taking no rebate with 0 % interest rate. So I chose $1,500 rebate with 3.99% interest rate, therefore we should have SUBTRACTED $1500 from our drive out amount ( $23,800) but they ADDED $ 1,429.28 first AND then deducted $1,500 AND also charge 3.99% of interest rate. We ended up with a rebate of only $70.72. This is trick they are playing.

1. The dealership used the new brake down amount instead of the agreed drive out price to confuse what is the exact price. (They never showed us the breakdown of the pricing before we signed the paper work)

2. The dealership is  mixing up the car price with finance promotion. (to avoid giving us the real $1500 rebate)

Now with the over charge and also the new car itself having problems, we asked for a full refund all money. They rejected again even with the warranty printed on the back of Power Nissan’s service invoice. According to Nissan’s own warranty, Nissan should replace or refund my car. 

I just want to tell all the people that want to buy a Nissan, save yourself the hassle and lies, and never go to Central Houston Nissan dealership.

4290,25,02-Feb-17,"Unfortunately, there is no way to give ""negative"" stars. If possible, I would.

First, I found a price for a vehicle on the website that I really wanted. Called and talked with Eric, and told him I would come out in the evening to look at it. The vehicle was listed as ""brand new"". Once I arrived and met with Eric, he said that the vehicle was not here, that a manager had taken it home for the day. Even though it was not here (per Eric at that time), since I knew that was the one I wanted, I told him no need to take a test drive, just show me another vehicle on the lot that has the same features to look into. At that point, I wanted him to start running the numbers to get financing in process, as I didn't want to be there all night.
Miraculously, the vehicle was found, but the pricing was given and it was higher than the advertised price on the internet. Why post a sale price and not honor it? Well, it is because it has been ""sold"" to the service department to be used there, and then ""sold"" back to sales to sell me. The rebates that would come with a new model do not apply, since it is NOT technically a new vehicle.

After going back and forth, a deal was made and I drove out of the dealership with my dream vehicle. For (2) weeks exactly, I drove around and showed all of my friends and family about all of the cool features that this truck has.

Then, (14) days after making the purchase and signing the contract, I was called and asked to come into the dealership to discuss some paperwork. It was then told to me that after all, the bank that I signed the contract with decided that they are not going to honor it. I had to either give it back and drive home in my previous vehicle that I traded in, or sign a NEW contract with a massive increase on interest rate. YOU ARE READING THIS RIGHT. THE CONTRACT I SIGNED WAS NOT BEING HONORED BY THE FINANCE COMPANY AND DEALERSHIP AFTER (14) DAYS. Nothing changed in my credit, and nothing was shown to be inaccurate in my application. I have NEVER had a legal document that I signed given back to me and told that the SELLER is not going to honor it. If I just showed up after 2 weeks and said I do not like the terms and want to change it, they would laugh me out the door. I had to either surrender the vehicle IMMEDIATELY or pay MORE money.

I never thought signing a legally binding contract can just be denied, after 2 weeks, with no lies or wrong information listed.

The only recourse will be to let as many people as I can all over the world know that in Texas, a vehicle contract with AutoNation means NOTHING. There are NO words to describe the feeling that a contract means nothing. There is NO language in the contract stating that it is waiting for approval, but this dealership makes deals, signs contracts between customers and finance companies, without getting approvals. I thought problems like this might come from a used car dealership that could be shady, but not the dealer on a NEW vehicle. I have been lied to at every point of the process of buying a NEW vehicle. Wrong price listed, NOT new as stated, contract cancelled after (2) weeks, and either sign a NEW contract with higher terms, or take back your previously paid off trade in and act like the last (2) weeks never happened.

UPDATE: After contacting the general manager of the facility, they changed my contract again back to the original contract. I do not know how this happened in the first place, but the general manager, Nick, was beyond helpful and fixed the issue. I am confident that the financing individuals did what they did to me without his knowledge.

At the end of the day, my issued were resolved. Unfortunately, this should have never happened the way it did. Hopefully, they have taken the steps necessary to make sure moving forward this does not happen again to anyone else.",2,312,Texas_without_threshold\Chrysler38 Reviews of AutoNation Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram Katy.csv
335,24,28-Jan-17,"I was very disappointed with my experience at this dealership.  I located the vehicle through USAA car buying service .  I called in advance and asked for a guaranteed total which included tax, tag and title, and any other dealer fees. I explained that I had previously had a very negative experience with dishonest care salesman and wanted this to be better.  I did not want to play games. The salesman gave me a price that was acceptable to me. I explained that I had a 2.15 hr drive to the dealership and I was ready to buy for the agreed price.  He also told me he could get me a loan in the 1s as my bank was offering 2.25 for 48 months.  When we arrived, we asked the salesman (William) to show us the finance docs, so we could see everything on paper.  He told us that the finance guy (Mike) would go over everything with us later and promised that everything was as discussed on the phone.  Shortly after, Mike had us start signing all the finance docs.  When we finally got to the numbers, the sales price shown on the paper was 500 more than what was agree to on the phone.  He explained that this was the price after the dealer fees were added to the sales price.  I told him this was unacceptable.  He left the room to discuss this with the manager and then came back and said that they agreed to give me the original price.  We continue signing papers and then he tells us our monthly payments.  We ask to see the document that shows how the payments were calculated.  It shows us paying 4.5% for 72 months.  Way more than we were promised. I explained that William had told us that we qualified for interest rates in the 1s.  He brought William in the room with us who said that's what he was told, then they brought in the guy who he said had told him that and he denied it.  The Finance Director, Amir then placed all the blame on WIlliam.  The whole experience was very uncomfortable.  I felt like everyone I dealt with was dishonest.  We ended up leaving with our vehicle.  1/2 way home I realized that in all the excitement, Mike (finance guy) had forgotten to take our 500 deposit.  We decided to wait for the dealership to contact us.  They called first thing in the morning and asked if we would pay over the phone.  I told them I would send a check.  I was upset about their treatment of me the day prior, so I was not going out of my way to accommodate them.  They did not want to accept a check, and asked if they could come pick up the money.  We agreed.  Mike said someone would be here later in the afternoon.  We waited at home all day long and no one ever came.  When I called to find out when they would arrive, Mike said they would not be able to make it today and would have to come the next day. I asked why no one had called earlier and he replied that they just got busy.  I then called the sales manager, Crayton Ronyon (spelling ??) to tell him about my negative experience at his dealership, hoping I would get some sort of sincere apology, but all he did was throw his employees under the bus and place all the blame on them.

We test drove a car yesterday. Before we left , Marissa, the Manager, stated that they made a mistake on the price and that the price would increase in 48 hours. I called back in less than 24 hours and they said the price already went up $2,000 and that they would not honor the price they quoted when I test drove the car. When I spoke to the salesman about it, he said the Manager told me 24 hours (which she did not, as my daughter heard her also and I even wrote it down) and that the car was just on sale at the time I looked at it. Either way, it's not my problem if they made a mistake on the price, plus I called back even before 24 hours was up, so their argument is full of it.

5440,32,08-Jan-17,"Grapevine Chrysler Jeep Dodge - Absolute crooks!  

I spent 3 hours negotiating a deal. After endless back and forth, we finally agreed on a deal which was $7,000 better than what they originally offered.  As we were going through that process, they tried to tell me I was saving $3,000 because I was only paying taxes on the difference between trade truck and new truck and not the full purchase price of the new one. Saving me money?  That is Texas state law. 

To put their stupidity into perspective, they understood that I was a 20 year banker (With experience in auto lending), I've purchased 4 $70,000 + vehicles in the last year and probably 30 over all. I'm not a novice. I mostly negotiate deals by phone and spend no more than 45 minutes at a dealer. 

Following that, it took more than an hour to get to finance and close the deal. The F/I manager was a decent guy, but initially tried to sell me a rate that was far more than a rate for which I qualify - almost 2% higher than what I'm currently paying. I had some back and forth with him and we got to the same rate I'm paying.  This had more to do with misinformation provided by the sales team than him. 

Next, we start reviewing the calculations. They apparently charge you $900 to walk from the showroom to the finance office.  The purchase price increased by $900 from what we agreed to which was also the price advertised on their website and cars.com. The additional charge was ""dealer adds"", one of which was a bed liner which the truck did not have. They could not tell me what ""adds"" were added and this wasn't disclosed to me until I was close to signing the note.  The Sales Manager came into the office to try to convince me that the dealer adds had value (again - adds that they couldn't itemize) and also to find discounts offered by the manufacturer  that they could apply to the inflated price to get me the price THEY ADVERTISED WITH NO DISCLAIMER!!!  

At this point, it was a matter of principle. I told him I wasn't paying 1 cent more than their advertised price and asked him to give me a yes or no answer if he was going to do the deal. He said no and I promptly left. 

These guys are incredibly dishonest and try to squeeze you for every dime. You must be a very shrewd negotiator, experienced buyer and disciplined to stand a chance of not getting screwed.

And don't suggest I call the general manager, I already did and he did not return my call. This would have been this fourth new Honda I've purchased.

15479,11,01-Jan-17,"We had the worst nightmare of our life by buying a new car at this dealership. Their finance reps rip you off in general We bought a brand new car with signed price proposal but when we went for the final paperwork, they charged a different price and added up all kinds of unnecessary options and access to jack up their financial greed. When we checked the car invoice and visited them, we were told that the signed price proposal has been shredded and they were unbelievably indecent. Their General Manager  was never available despite our numerous visits to their dealership.",1,886,Texas_without_threshold\Kia30 Reviews of Central Kia of Plano.csv
