Today my son, his wife and I endured 3 hours of a classical ""bait and switch"" game at the Capitol Hyundai in San Jose, CA. We should have left at the first sign of trouble. That is on us. We are not experienced dealership customers. We speak with an accent and I believe our accent and foreign names were the reasons for this frustrating encounter.
They didn't have the car we wanted (it was sold miraculously yesterday although it was still listed in the inventory today) but, fortunately, they had an older model for a ""better price"" that was printed out after a long struggle with computers and printers. We said we had a pre-approved loan and were ready to pay the quoted ""better price"" with a bank check. They decided to beat our bank's loan offer and 30 minutes later a new quote was printed that was $3000 more than the first one! They insisted that we ""misread"" the first document. The new one had a much higher APR than we got from our bank, there was a ""downpayment"" of $2500 added to the previously quoted price, and, by the way, the promised discounts were cancelled because we were ""refusing their financing""!!!! They were cancelled on the quote for their financing offer!!! The salesman was constantly disappearing ""to figure out stuff"", lying, stalling, and trying to pressure us into a horrible deal. I keep thinking that, may be, my accent, or my blond hair made him think I was so stupid I could possibly buy that load of you know what??? My son and his wife kept their composure to the end but I have to admit that I lost it a bit. This was the most blatant and pathetic attempt of swindling I have ever witnessed. The sleazy and greedy salesmen from Capitol Hyundai in San Jose, CA are trying to intimidate and manipulate potential customers. Please do not expect them to honor any of their promises.",1,sn
725,16-Jul-16,I gave my Santa Fe to check a simple AC issue last Wednesday. The advisor told me he will give me an update by evening. The next day he was on leave. I followed up with a call on Friday and they didn't even care to provide me any alternative. I am still waiting to get some response. When I called the service phone number it goes on for some time and then to the answering machine. And here I am still waiting to get any response. Nobody took the responsibility to either let me know what's happening or give me a date when I can get  my car back. I didn't expect this from Hyundai service centre at least.,1,
836,06-May-16,"I was looking for a used car.  I contacted Capitol Hyundai via internet.  They called me back and seemed very nice.  I ended up purchasing a different car from somewhere else.  I got another call back as they wanted to check and see if I needed any assistance.  I told the young man that I had just purchased another kind of car and was in the middle of saying thank you very much for all their assistance, but he hung up on me right after I mentioned the purchase.  Unbelievably insulting and unprofessional.  At this point I would tell people not to deal with them the classy thing to do would have been to say Thank you for contacting us and to enjoy your new car!",1,
1026,23-Oct-15,"I came here for minor maintenance service, which I bought a whole package when I bought my car. They promises me it took abt 1 to 1.5hrs, but I had to wait 3 hours with or without appointment. So badly",1,
153,07-Sep-17,They told me many incorrect facts during the negotiation and tried to sell me products I didn't want. When I got the car it was defective and paint was peeling off after 2-3. They didn't offer me any exchange or compensation and just told me to take it to service department. It now more than 22 days in body shop!!,1.2,
0,30-Nov-18,"I left my car for a warranty check up because my rear tires were cupping. Was told they might need to keep it overnight ( the appointment was made 3 weeks in advance). The advisor sent me a text to check on status. Sent him a text towards the end of the day. No response. Called back the next day. He is off and cannot get an answer on the status until he comes back to work. What a bogus answer.
Worst service that I have ever seen.",1.3,
4,13-Jan-18,"I have several complaints and negative information about the employees and the experience at this dealership. They do not stand by their information and if you are not alert and pay attention to details of the offer, they take advantage of you and try to have one up on you. They do not honor what they say. I will lever go back again and will never recommend my large network to ever give this place their business.",1.3,
295,31-May-17,"Absolutely horrible customer service. Attempted to charge us an additional grand for absolutely nothing, until we brought it to their attention that the price seemed higher than expected (to which the claimed that it was correct for the next 15 minutes before agreeing to fix it). Car was missing navigation card, and we were told we could come back for it the next day. Over a week, and 3-4 visits back, we still don't have the navigation card. Windshield came scratched, and they said they'd fix it for us, but that still hasn't been done either. When the time comes to purchase another Hyundai, we will 100% be shopping at a different location.",1.4,
851,19-Apr-16,Irene who handles UberX lease he did a terrible job after my asking her if I was going to be paying 250 a month she said 180 come to find out it was 180 a week not a month,1.4,
230,06-Jul-17,"I recently purchased new Hyundai Sonata on lease. My salesperson was Ronald Tobin. Ronald is by far the worst salesperson I have ever encountered in my life. He was rude from the beginning and was not there to sell the car, rather his whole mission was to prove the customer wrong by random fumbling even when he knew he was wrong.  Instead of making the whole buying process a smooth and amiable one, he made it so stressful that I considered not buying the car just because the attitude of Ronald but since my friends had come with me that day to help me buy a car just on that day,  we decided to sit through and bear that guy. Ronald is extremely rude salesperson. From the beginning, he made it seem like it was us who were in need of the car and he was not interested in selling it and interrupted whenever I started to speak up. He does not know how to understand a customer or does not have the patience to hear out  their opinion. He would just start speaking up with no clear objective and start making up things half way in between. I stayed there for 9 hours and it was a very tedious experience given my salesperson did not try to make my visit any worth it. It was my friends and I who were trying to propose a figure in order to get the deal closed and Ronald, on the other hand, did not even try to negotiate, rather was vehemently raising objections on everything and seemed that he was hell bent that the deal does not closed. To add to the blunder, MY CAR DOES NOT EVEN HAVE THE CAR NUMBER STICKER sticked in front of the wind screen. I am driving it without a temp number. When I called and tried to explain him the matter, he again began by trying to prove me wrong and stared fumbling instead of being polite enough and accept his mistake. It was my misfortune that I had to deal with such bad salesperson. I request Hyundai to please change my salesperson and assign me a new point of contact who is sensible enough to try to help out the customers and not try to argue with them.",1.6,
2,03-May-18,"Don't go here if you don't want to be mislead, disrespected and lied to. 

Long story short: I was lead to believe I was coming in to buy a car that was sold 5 days prior. And I only learned that the car was already sold upon arriving at the dealership, after having made a 50 mile trip out of my way (even though we kept in contact for the entire 5 days). 

Long story: I came in at 7pm on a Monday with the intention of buying a 2018 Elantra. We have agreed upon a price with the salesman John Nava beforehand, over the internet, but it took an additional 1.5 hours of negotiations with Gus, a sales manager who plays the really, really bad cop (btw, you've overdoing it a bit, Gus), just to get BACK to the agreed upon number with John. From 9 to about 11pm I was told to just sit there and wait for financing (there was literally one other customer at the dealership between two financial managers). Finally, at 11pm, in the financing office, I was offered to sign some document that did not contain any financing information, no APR or bank name, just the car+documents+tax prices. After asking which bank this is and the APR I was approved for, the financial lady told me that all the banks are now closed and they can't have me approved. I would have to take the car home and come back again tomorrow. I was very angry, since I live 50 miles away and don't have a car of my own to get back. At this point, it's a $60 uber ride home. I wasn't going to take this card blanche new car home without signing the PROPER documents first. After asking why I was made to wait this long if you knew that ""the banks are closed"", I got some bs from Jalil, the head finance manager, trying to convince me that everything is going to be fine and I should take the car home. The finance lady offered me a ride home, which I accepted. She went on to ask John to give me a ride home, and he got veeery angry. I said that I will come back to buy this car in two days, but much earlier in the day, but John was done talking to me at that point. I called my $60 uber ride home, while the financial manager Jalil offered to make a $60 discount on the car when I come back to buy it. 
A day later Jalil called me up to say that I've been approved by a bank and that everything is set. 

Two days later, on Wednesday, I am ready to head back to the dealership. I call Jalil with a few important questions before going, but he says he will call me back in 5. Three times. THREE times I had to call him over four hours just to be promised a callback. I ended up not going there because I didn't receive some very important answers.

On Friday John Nava calls me to ask when I will be coming in to buy the car. I say I'm not sure exactly when, but next week for sure. He says GREAT! ... with a kind of ""see ya never"" tone...

On Monday I get a cashier's check with a sizeable downpayment IN THE NAME OF THE DEALERSHIP (the dealership charges an additional $120 if you use a debit card for downpayment), ready to go get the car. I've also emailed John Nava with some final questions, just to make sure it's the same deal, but the quick to reply before man was now completely silent. Around noon I call John telling him that I will be there at 7pm and that I'd like Jalil to be there to finish our business (I wasn't going to let the $60 uber ride slide as a matter of principal). He says GREAT! Come on in, Jalil will be here. I decide to call Jalil as well, just to make sure, because I had a weird hunch about John not telling me something. I tell him that I AM COMING IN TODAY TO FINISH OUR BUSINESS. He naturally says he will ""I'll call you back in 5"", and, naturally, never does. At this point I still have no idea that the car I'm after is sold. I get on the train, and as I approach my final station, I get a call from Jalil at 6.30pm. He tells me two things: 1) my car was sold 5 days ago and 2) Jalil is headed to the Sharks game right now. Wow. That's awesome! 

At this point I decide between turning back or going there and ripping their heads off. I decided to still go and try and get the same deal. Nope. They weren't having it. The EXACT SAME CAR, but a few days ""newer"" was going for a grand+ more. John had a very smug look on his face when I came in. Nicely played John, nicely played. I walked out immediately. Very, very bitter aftertaste. 

I strongly discourage anyone from doing business with these dishonest and disrespectful people.",1.8,
246,22-Jun-17,"Finance guy very pushy trying to sell me something I did not want, I almost Walk Out will never  buy a car there again or recommend you",1.8,
18,16-Dec-17,"Many misrepresentations, felt ""jerked around"" and lied to.  Went back the next day after purchase to complain and the price came down miraculously.  Attention to detail is lacking at this dealership (paperwork had to be redone 3 times).  Liked the car and it was already a week after purchase that the realization that one of the important features I was told was on my car was in fact not available.  Had a very positive experience at another DGDG dealership two years ago and expected the same.  Highly disappointed.",2,
781,10-Jun-16,I believe there was too much pressure to get on to the next customer. Someone should have checked tire better. I am returning to Capitol Hyundai for another tire and see if they can do anything about body damage.,2,
857,14-Apr-16,She it's giving me a different car that the show me first and payment it's different too now I driving a car i don't like and not happy with this lease,2,
870,07-Apr-16,"I sill say Steve Yee was very nice as was the salesman that came with me on the test drive. Those were your only two saving graces in this incident. You need to keep them but really evaluate how your people handle future situations. To have everything at the time of sale,  yet a week later to bother and repeat bother a customer when told not too is bad practice and makes for poor customer surveys. Not that I think this survey means very much to your company nor will I receive any satisfaction from doing the survey BUT you do now know you will never receive any future business or get any future referals from me or my family.",2.2,
1082,25-Aug-15,"The day after the sale I was contacted by the finance manager Jason marcucci, telling me that my financing might have a problem. I was told that proof of residency was not needed. I did not have this documentation and contacted Jason back for a follow up. I left both a voicemail and email. I have not heard from him since. A courtesy email would have been nice but I received now word. Even tried to contact the sales person whose name is escaping me right now but he also did not respond. Will think twice about dealing with these guys again.",2.2,
685,11-Aug-16,"Edwardo (the sale's person) was truly professional however when we went the second time to see him we were met with a different sale's person which was totally out placed and lost,tried to sell us a used car which we were not there to buy  thanks to Edwardo who finished the deal --and we got what we went to the dealer to buy-- even thou he was fairly new on the job.",2.5,
523,01-Dec-16,The cars are over priced. They show you how much your really paying off after the car is paid. I don't know if I want to come back to this dealership after my experience and I don't know if I can recommend the dealership to my friends if they keep doing what their doing.,2.6,
1041,05-Oct-15,"My optional contracts have not yet been cancelled even though its been nearly a month since I bought the car. Even after rigorous followups, no conclusive result. The dealership will just find ways to ignore me. They were very quick to sell the vehicle/optional contracts and I hoped they will show the same quickness to help me cancel it but far from it. Very disappointing.

My second key is not yet with me. I followed up on that so many times and yesterday I was told(when I called) that my key is available and I can come and collect it.

I feel I was tricked by the dealership and am thoroughly disappointed by the dealership.",2.6,
291,01-Jun-17,"I went on a Friday night and was basically the only customer there, but it took over four hours to test drive one car, pick out a different one and fill out all the paperwork. I had to return the next day to get the car detailed. When it was presented to me, it did not have a cargo cover and so I had to return again to get the cargo cover. After I got the cargo cover, I noticed that there was sticky residue where all the sheets containing the vehicle info had been pasted on the car, but I did not want to have to return again a third time to have that taken care of. The car does not seem to have been polished either. Although I was offered a first oil change for free, since I prepaid for 3 years worth of maintenance, that offer meant nothing and when I asked for something else instead, I did not get any response. The salesperson was very hard to understand because of her accent and her odd way of pronouncing certain words. The manager did not explain the charges for the lease in a way that was understandable and used generic terms for charges that could be anything.",2.8,
592,14-Oct-16,"My purchase experience at Capitol Hyundai, San Jose, was flawless.  However, my overall experience of taking ownership of my new Hyundai has been completely ruined by the fact that:  - the dashboard lights do not work when I have the dimmer lights or the full headlights on - the air conditioning is not working when I have the dimmer lights or the full headlights on - the dashboard lights and the air conditioning are starting to not work even when I have no lights on  I have never had a completely new car and the dashboard lights and the air conditioning do not work.  This makes me think very seriously if I want to purchase another Hyundai when I will be replacing my car in the next 4+ years.  I will consider a Toyota or other Asian car manufacturer whose delivery quality will be more assured.",3,

970,16-Dec-15,"The original car salesman was fantastic - charismatic, informed, and energetic. The person we were switched to during pricing and the finance guy? Not so much.

Overall, the process took beyond a reasonable amount of time. I recommend you do your research to get a fair price, find the right car for you, and come in with a check or cash from your bank or loan (so you don't sit for hours waiting for the agressive finance guys).",3.4,

292,01-Jun-17,My overall experience there at the dealership was great. Everyone was friendly and I never felt pressured to buy. I was able to take my time and look at the different cars. This was by far the best experience I had in buying a new car.,3.8,

1058,22-Sep-15,I ended up getting a car I didn't necessarily want but saw the value in getting it!... I was there from 1030- 730 pm!

I then got a co-signer with a higher credit score. We went and signed the paperwork which I was told was the same deal. The new interest rate was higher but we signed anyway.  When I got home and looked at my new paperwork compared to the original, the price had changed by HUNDREDS of dollars. Now my new payment was higher because of a higher interest rate and more money financed. I felt taken advantage of, its NOT the same deal/price I had originally agreed to. It was a very dishonest way to add a few hundred dollars to your bottom line.",4,

558,07-Nov-16,"Our salesman Adam Ramsdale was awesome!  It took me a long time to choose a new car.  I came back three times!  He was not ""pushy"" which I really appreciated.  Adam was knowledgeable and patient.  I ended up wanting the color iron frost which they did not have and they ordered it for me in Oregon and had the car shipped.  It even came in a day early and Adam came in on his day off to be sure he was here for the delivery and cleaning and explanation of how to use the car and it's many features.  He really went the extra mile for us.  All in all , I am very happy with the Santa Fe and the services provided to me at Capitol Hyundai.",4.8,

I also worked with a gentleman who rode with me on the test drive and explained all the car's technology and maintenance schedule. He was also a pleasure to work with.

753,02-Jul-16,"Nice dealer work. I was impressed with their receiving, professional nature with customers. Experienced the best car buying time. Other car dealers were completely unprofessional - especially hyundai serramonte, and dublin Hyundai. Who never sticked to the appointment. Even with appointment, we had to wait for 3 hrs at dublin hyundai and after negotiations they turned me down. And was called back after confirming numbers over phone, again a turn down. Same with Hyundai serramonte, We agreed on a number and was turned down after going there. When I ask why, they claim they have the color I wanted.  But with capitol Hyundai, I called them. Elwira gave me a number. We agreed on it. Went to the dealership, filled out the papers, drove off with my car in 90 mins :) I am really happy with the way they dealt.   Cheers",4.8,
766,23-Jun-16,"We were referred to Capitol Hyundai to meet Elwira Wilczynska by our son Dustin who has a Veloster  already. We met with her June 11, 2016 and she was ready for us and took care of us completely.  Elwira is professional she listens and  is informative and fun... no hard sale. Then we met Jason Marcucci the financial director and he was  great too. We talked about just fun  things actually then he offered options for the car for coverage etc and we bought the extra things he offered. Very relaxed he was then he went down the list and offered us the different options.  We left happy for the experience and we love our new car. Our son has a 2014 Veloster and we purchased  a 2016 so we already knew the kind of car we were getting and how it performed.",4.8,
774,17-Jun-16,"The whole buying experience was very positive.  The first for me!  The facilities were very clean, modern, and had a very professional environment.  Every staff member spoke to us very curiously.  The buying process was much faster than any others I have experienced but still not ideal.  To be fair, there were other customers so it was a waiting game to see finance and then to get the car ready.  But overall, much speedier than all the other dealers from whom I bought cars.",4.8,
795,02-Jun-16,"The communication within the dealer and understanding what i wanted made it very easy to work with. The car i was going to get was a Hybrid Sonata, but it didn;t make sense since i am not commuting to work and could have more features with a sport sonata.",4.8,

I did have a strange moment with the financer where I felt pressured to buy the 10 yr extended warranty and he put the price higher and asked for a higher interest rate, I was ready to walk out the door, however another financer came in and rectified the situation. The next week I was asked to come back to the dealer and they explained the whole situation and the numbers in a very friendly and efficient way and apologised for the previous experience, they offered me a lower interest rate loan and treated me so nicely and even filled my cousin's tank. I was so pleased with the overall experience, great to see that even when mistakes happen you are honest and make a genuine effort to rectify it apologise and make the customer feel valued! Great work and great team!!!! Another point, 3 weeks after purschasing the car, I was about to go on a road trip and checked to find out that a brand new car does not come with a spare tire...to spend a large amount of money to purchase a brand new vehicle and not get a spare tire is extremely strange...",4.8,

1,25-Sep-18,"My wife's Elantra had a left rear flat tire.  She initially drove it to Capitol Hyundai (CH) to see if they could fix the flat.  The greeter (Jerry I think; very friendly person) said he would put air in the tire as he did not see any nails or other visible factors that might be causing the flat.  My wife then went home.  The next morning we immediately noticed a very flat (same) tire on her Elantra.  She called our roadside service company and they came and changed out the tire.  We brought the flat tire to CH and was immediately received by Jonathan M. He too didn't see any visible nails or objects but stated we could leave the car and he assured us he would do his best to get the car back to us the same day or early the next day.  We left the car and about 30 minutes later he calls me and said after conducting some tests they (technicians) determined that there was a very small piece of metal lodged deep in the tire, causing it to leak.  Because it was late in the day, Jonathan said the car was ready for pick up and he would wait a few minutes until we picked up the car.  He also knew we were down one car and he assured us the car would be ready.  Once we retrieved our car, he greeted us with that same warm smile and explained in detail what the trouble was and what they did about it.  More importantly (and past experience), mechanics and dealerships usually talk to you like you already know what the problem is and it is implied that you understand what ""they"" are talking about.  My wife and I did not feel that way at all because he broke it down in layman's terms.  As a customer, this is all we could ask for.  A very pleasant experience whenever we go to CH.  Thanks team!",5,

And the price was right. My highest recommendation for this team at Capitol Genesis. AND THE CAR IS SUPERB!!",5,

34,08-Dec-17,"My family and I were promptly greeted Tommy Tran. We found out that the Ioniq EV we had come to see wasn't available yet, but Tommy asked us about what we were looking for (commuter car, carpool lane access) and told us about the Sonata Plug-in Hybrid, which hadn't even been on my radar. We got to test drive the car within minutes, and he let both me and my dad take turns.  When I wanted more time to think and do research (because I hadn't even been considering hybrids), he wasn't pushy about us going home and coming back the next weekend. He sent emails/texts during the week to answer any questions I had (especially about the lease terms/accident coverage).  When we came back the next weekend, he was ready to help us out, and we were able to come to an agreement quickly thanks to the No-Brainer Pricing.  The only imperfect part of the experience was the long wait for the finance manager to pay for the lease and hammer out the terms of the lease. We were also surprised by the turn-in fee due at the end of the lease, which I didn't think I'd heard about before talking to the finance manager.  But our actual experience with Sarn Saefong was excellent. He was very professional and good at explaining confusing parts of the contract. I didn't feel rushed at all; he walked through the different options as many times as I needed to choose things like a maintenance plan and wear/tear coverage.  The car was very clean when we got to it after the finance meeting/paying the downpayment. We got to drive it off the lot right there.  This was a great experience. I liked Tommy & Sarn, and I felt that I got a really good deal. After driving the Sonata Plug-in Hybrid for several weeks now, I don't regret the lease at all. It's a really great car. Thank you, Capitol Hyundai!",5,

When we returned to buy the car, they had already sold the one we intended to buy. Luckily they found the next level trim in the same color we intended to buy. Without initially even telling us, they substituted the higher trip (all wheel drive) for the one we wanted and kept the price the same. Most dealers play the switch and bait to upsell you the next trim level, but these guys are the opposite, they essentially gave us the next level without even asking. It doesn't get better that this.

Steven wasted no time in giving me a price. I tried doing the same with a couple other dealerships, but the other dealerships played games. I then used Steven's price as a comparison with the other dealerships and none could match the deal proposed by Capitol Hyundai. I purchased the car in about an hour or so after initially making contact with Steven. When I arrived at the dealership, the car was being detailed.  This was the easiest car purchase of my life. I appreciate Steven's direct approach. I also appreciate he valued my time and we didn't need to play the car salesman gimmicks.",5,

My family and I did not feel pressured at all to purchase a vehicle from Capitol Hyundai, which is the main reason why we chose to deal with them (rather than the folks at Toyota dealership).  Kudos to the whole staff for such consistent and excellent customer service who all went above and beyond. Many thanks to Ninous who took the time to show us all the different Hyundai models (since this is our first time considering a Hyundai vehicle). He also took the time to explain our leasing and purchasing options. At the end of it all, he was even kind enough to give us a ride home after trading in our old car. This is a true indicator of impeccable customer service from start to finish. Thank you so much Capitol Hyundai for making this a very memorable and such an easy car shopping experience! We will certainly think of them the very next time we are ready for our next car!",5,

Adam was great as well since he kept in touch with me through e-mails when I was searching for a car, and he thoroughly went through some of the vehicles options to get me started such as the radio, blue tooth, and GPS. Jelil was being patient with me to go over all the paperwork, even if it was after midnight. The whole experience was positive and pleasant, not like some of the dealerships I've been to before deciding to return to Capitol Hyundai.",5,

516,06-Dec-16,I was taken care of from the beginning to end. I've worked with the staff a few months prior when my husband got his Santa Fe. I was impressed with them then and still am now.

530,01-Dec-16,"Aaron was great! He greeted us and made us truly feel like family. He took the time to work out the numbers I wanted and needed and even made sure the exact car I wanted was at the dealership during my visit the next day. He went above and beyond to make me feel comfortable buying a car here.   Anthony (AJ) was also super amazing! He took my mom, cousin and I on a very thorough test drive. The route he had planned allowed us to feel the car on winding roads and potholes. He even asked us to drive the car as we normally would such as speeding up on the freeway and braking quickly. He even took the time to show us everything under the hood and how the reverse camera functioned. All of this allowed us to fully see and understand how the car really drove and functioned. The very next day he went to Gilroy to get the exact car I wanted, and I am very grateful for that! The rest of my buying experience with him was amazing. He has a very bubbly personality so I did not feel pressured during any of the buying process. Before coming here I was shopping for about 2 weeks at other dealerships and all of the sales men made me feel pressured or hesitant to give them any information. AJ was very polite and did not push me to provide any information I was not comfortable with at that time. Once I had finished the whole purchase I was pretty exhausted and overwhelmed but AJ recognized this and made sure I felt excited and happy when he handed me the keys and showed me everything in my new car.  Thank you guys for a great buying experience!!!",5,

I already knew what I wanted, but my wife needed some convincing.  So we test drove a Tuscon and Santa Fe Sport.  I must say, that AJ was very helpful with taking the time to explain everything to my wife.  This was key.  I sometimes don't have the patience explain why something is important, but AJ knew where and when to jump in.  He was also (again) great with our daughter.  We decided to go with the Santa Fe Sport, got a great deal, and couldn't be happier.  Truly an awesome experience!  Thanks Again AJ!",5,

690,06-Aug-16,"Originally my family came into Capital Hyundai to just check out the cars and possibly compare them to other manufacturers. Having only the experience of purchasing and driving used cars, going into a dealership was a bit scary and overwhelming. I came in thinking a salesman was going to show me a bunch of top notch cars and try to sell to me something I didn't really need. However the staff of Capital Hyundai made my shopping experience a very positive one. I was greeted the moment I got out of my old car by Montana, who presented me with options so that I can fully decide on which car suited me best. He also laid down all the specs of the vehicle and made sure that the car I was interested in was worth my investment. The most important thing was that the staff (Kenneth) worked with my sister and I to make sure that we left Capital Hyundai that day with keys in our hands. It was only have we drove off with our new, beautiful car that I realized I didn't even check out th competition across the street. We give a 10/10 for the whole staff!",5,

692,06-Aug-16,"After my previous car being totaled in an accident I needed a new commuting car fast.  Spoke with Elwira over the phone.  Told her what I wanted and that I was trying to find the lowest prices among 5 other dealers.  She gave me a price along with a link to the car I would actually purchase.  Funny enough her price was the lowest out of them all and at the same time she did not try to force me to give personal information to try and ""pre qualify""  for a loan.  One dealership would not even give me a price until I gave them my SS# which I thought was strange.  Few weeks later I was at the dealership and driving off in my new car.  Smooth and easy process which I would recommend to anyone.",5,
693,05-Aug-16,The Tucson fuel cell has worked well for us so far and will even better when we receive our white sticker to be in the car pool lane with 1 driver.  Excellent staff & service.,5,
695,04-Aug-16,"Elwira Wilczynska was amazing.   We were looking for a base Santa Fe Sport 2.0 Turbo with AWD which is next to impossible.  But she searched and searched and called every dealership in CA and NV to find what we needed.   Unfortunately we were just not able to find what we needed, but I will definitely go back to Capitol Hyundai and Elwira for more vehicles. ",5,

701,02-Aug-16,"Just wanted to thank Capitol Hyundai for a very positive dealer experience. I am continually amazed by how poorly the car buying experience goes for most people. It is the second most expensive thing most of us buy and we usually get worse service than I would at Target. Thankfully, this was not the case. The dealership was receptive to my questions, quickly figured out that to get me in the exact car I wanted would require a special order and placed it without trying to sell me one of the much more expensive models they had on the lot. Great job, thank you very much!",5,
702,01-Aug-16,"Had a great experience at Capitol Hyundai, my husband and i had an idea of what we wanted but after only a few minutes of great questions the salesman, Ruben, had some cars for us to look at..each one of them were great.

The thing that impressed me most was that I had originally decided on just an Elantra Limited with a tech package, bought one on a Saturday night, and on Monday morning I changed my mind and asked to upgrade to the ultimate package.    Even though I was outside the 24 Hour exchange window, Anthony and Capitol Hyundai were happy to do this exchange the next morning.  It was a great customer service experience, and not something that you see often with car dealers.  They could have easily said no, but instead wanted to make sure I was satisfied.  I can honestly say that I am satisfied, and I wouldn't dream of going anywhere else for when we upgrade my wife's car in a few years.  So, thank you AJ and Capitol Hyunday again for the awesome service!",5,

The place kind of lives up to its aim of providing a family-like and trust-worthy team of sellers.   Not very impressed with the toilet.

I called Brian and told him what I was looking for and what happened, he worked on the deal and had it done in 15 minutes.

The badgering from the sales person, and then his/her manager (the closer), and then as if that wasn't enough you get abused by the finance person.  At Capitol Hyundai you experience nothing like that.  At least from my experience, my mother-in-law's experience and my nephew's experience.

1076,03-Sep-15,"When you arrive at the dealership, request Ryan Paek. He is absolutely an honest guy. We had no intention to lease a Hyundai Genesis, that was until Ryan showed us we could lease the car at a fantastic rent charge and with generous applied incentives. We were going to lease a less expensive different model, but with Ryans help we are driving in luxury every day now! What a nice car, we love it. This is the second car we have leased with Ryan's help in two years time. Our daughter loves her Veloster too! Bottom line, you get more standard options for the dollar with a Hyundai product as compared to other brands.",5,

1079,27-Aug-15,Casey Wilson and Sarin Meng were both a tremendous help with this purchase of my 2016 Elantra!

Thanks Guys!! ,5,
1080,25-Aug-15,"We'd really done our research. We decided on a Hyundai. After going to our local dealership, having an utterly disappointing experience we'd decided not to buy Hyundai. A family member suggested DGDG Capitol. We took his suggestion even though we had to drive sixty-four miles passing at least four other Hyundai dealer ships. We informed the dealer ship via the internet that we were  interested in buying a Hyundai. Driving to the dealer ship we received an email and a telephone call from Mannie. When we got to the dealer ship we were warmly greeted. The warmth, the friendliness and professionalism only got better as we made and completed the deal. Mannie and the rest of the Capitol team could not have done anything else to cause our experience to be so great. ",5,
1081,25-Aug-15,"Thank You Hyundai Dearlership for my new car,LOVE IT!!!Thank You Mannie For all your help,coming in on your day off,that was very nice of him, and Thank You Jason,your a nice guy,very professional and friendly men!!!!",5,

He also was willing to help me get an excellent price, keeping his word at every step of the way.  When I finally bought the car, I came in at closing.  The staff worked with me until 11 pm with no complaints.  I highly recommend Capitol Hyundai if you are in the market for a car!",5,
1085,21-Aug-15,It was a good experience for me because it was my first time purchasing a car. Simmon answered all of our questions and did not pressure us at all.

1097,11-Aug-15,"I haven't bought a car in 17 years, and I dreaded dealing with pushy salespeople and driving away with a great vehicle but much deeper in debt than I had expected. The experience at Capitol Hyundai was much much better than I expected. The salesperson wasn't pushy at all, but worked to understand our goals and offer a number of choices to meet them.

1100,05-Aug-15,"Salesperson Simmon Wong treated me like a human being.  He was courteous, attentive, responsive and polite - never turning on any boiler room tactics, nor did he pressure me into anything I didn't want.  Over at the Service Dept., a guy named Jerry shoed exemplary character, professionalism, warmth and friendliness.  He connected with me, reaffirmed my purchase as a fellow Hyundai owner, and made me feel top-notch about my purchase.  The staff are highly professional, courteous and thorough.  The waiting room has decent coffee - with not just Splenda but also half-and-half in cups instead of that powdered corn syrup solids stuff like Coffeemate (a small thing but it means a lot).  I had previously driven an Accord and my dealership was extremely good from sales to service.  Capitol Hyundai tops that experience with their friendliness.  The people who handled the sales paperwork, check processing, etc. were also very warm and made the process easy and go fast.  I'm extremely impressed with these people.  They deserve a great shout-out. :-)",5,
1101,29-Jul-15,"I had the pleasure of meeting Nicholas at Capitol Hyundai. He is a great sales person. After talking to several dealers earlier in the day, Nicholas was a breath of fresh air. I appreciated his friendliness, professionalism, and patience. He was very thorough in explaining the vehicle information and made me feel he was trying to get me the best deal possible. I also had the pleasure of meeting Jason and his team who worked hard to find me the lowest interest rate possible. Not an easy task given my credit score. Overall I'm very satisfied with my 2016 Elantra and the deal I got!!",5,
