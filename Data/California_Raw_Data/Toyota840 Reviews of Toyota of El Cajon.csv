4,"March 10, 2020","My recent experience at Toyota of El Cajon validated why I made the right decision in choosing Toyota of El Cajon not only as the place where I bought my car but why it is the place where I choose to have my Toyota serviced. Simo and his team at Toyota of El Cajon helped me to realize my dream of having my own Toyota C-HR ""TRD"" Edition. I bought the TRD Air Intake Kit and the TRD Lowering Springs at Toyota of El Cajon for my C-HR. I was able to install the Air Intake Kit myself but the instillation of the Lowering Springs was something I was not able to do. Simo was able to work with me and help me have my TRD Lowering Springs installed and I could not be any happier. Great service from beginning to end. Thank you Simo and the team of Toyota of El Cajon! My Toyota C-HR ""TRD"" Edition looks amazing and is everything I wanted it to be. It also helps that Simo is also a car guy and could appreciate the modifications and genuinely share in my excitement after the job was done. Does not get any better than this!",5.0

This dealership sold me this excellent car and when it’s time for another, it’s the first place I’ll go. On this visit I replaced my tires after 45k. I got a quote that included a full wheel alignment and compared it to the local discount tire shops that also sold Yokohama tires.

78,"September 17, 2019"," I have had a Toyota Highlander Hybrid for the past 14 years, it needed a few minor fixes but my husband wanted me in a newer vehicle. I was unsure of what make/model of vehicle I wanted. Needless to say I ventured out & looked at Subaru, Jeep, Ford, Chevy, Nissan, Hyundai, even Lexus & Mercedes. I found that I was comparing all of them to the Toyota Highlander XLE & returned numerous times to verify my findings. I compared:  price, ease & comfort of the drive, electronic features- XLE has lots!,  interior space, seat style & leg room compatibility, moon roof, AC vents, even color: do you know most new cars are all black inside? etc. XLE even has a few little 'fun' interior perks. Then the key less lock/entry feature was a true surprise (after I purchased the car)
I must applaud my sales man Victor Aceves for his continued patience, flexibility & attentiveness that he offered me, even on his day off. Thank you for making this purchase a stress free one.
Lastly, I have been dealing with the customer service @ Toyota for 14 years. And Toyota is Dog Friendly!  I can not praise the service department enough, I've come to trust & value their opinions; Lance Jones, Jesse Carvalho, Josh Taylor~ Thank You for the excellent care over the past 14 years.

I got there pretty late, around 8ish - I mainly wanted to see if it was even an option to do as I had quite a upside down on my car. I walked in and was greeting right away, I was given all my choices. I will say it was quite refreshing to get the upfront response to my questions rather than beating around the bush or trying to pressure me into something I didn’t want. I really liked the CHR that had just come out and I was able to test drive it and work everything out; APR, monthly payment, model within 2 HOURS!!!!! I was blown away! I’ve had 4 dealership cars in the past and it’s always a mind draining whole day process which I was expecting. The whole process was amazing and not ONCE did they try to change my mind in what I wanted, on the other hand they really went over and above on getting my the car I wanted.

I have called the  main line MULTIPLE times,  through out the sales and booking for service with nothing but ringing and then getting a voice mail for some random employee who has nothing to do with my needs. When I was trying to schedule with a sales person assigned to me through Costco I was told later by my sales representative that the random person at the voicemail was no longer there. I don't know about the more recent one. I don't remember ever getting a busy signal, just constant ringing.

From what I could see there is one person sitting in the middle of the room answering the phone. It seems so primitive that she doesn't have a back-up. 

I also tried to directly call the service person that I first saw and she didn't respond or answer my voicemails. As it turns out she also is no longer there. Who maintains voicemails of employees that are long gone?

The whole system needs a serious revision.

My first car was a Honda. The phone situation at Honda was excellent. It was always answered and put through to the right department.

145,"May 23, 2019","We got a very good deal when we purchased our Highlander here (thank you Ross Miran)

I always get the car serviced here, and the work has always been great. This latest experience was somewhat of a problem, however. The day after the service, the brand new battery died, and I had to have the car towed back to Toyota of E. C (paid for by Toyota). Apparently, a cable running to the alternator had gotten disconnected during the service, and was not re-connected. Therefore, there was no charge going to the battery. This had to have happened during the servicing, since a battery would not have lasted long without charging. The brand new one only lasted less than 24 hours before running down.

Josh, the service writer, was excellent, and handled the problem very professionally.

166,"April 09, 2019","The experience was ok but here are some suggestions.   We had an appointment at 9:15 am and was told to show up a few minutes early which we showed up at 9am.   The line to check our car in wrapped around the front of the location.   We were told that many cars showed up without an appointment.   But we sat in the same line as the others.   There should be a line for those that plan ahead and not have to wait for those that do not.  This was not ok.   We were told a cone would be placed on our car that had ""appointment"" on it so it would be taken in front of those that didn't.  That didn't happen also.  A number was placed on the car which made me believe there wasn't a priority for making the appointment.   

The second suggestion is to confirm the appointment once and  know what they are calling about.   I received an E-mail requesting we bring the car in for a 6 month service inspection and there was an area to make notes.   I wrote we didn't have enough miles to change the oil/filter but would bring it in to check fluid levels.  I received a text which I preferred a text confirming the appointment time.  
I also received  a call from a lady asking why I needed to bring the car in and when I mentioned it was the 6 month service she said I'll have service call you.  I asked her to please not have anyone call me.   I received an Email after that confirming the appointment again.  I may be unique but I'm 
responsible and don't need multiple confirmations to make sure I show up on time.  I believe I may have received an E-mail Friday night before the Saturday appointment also.  
Too much confirming!   If I make an appointment I'll be there on time I guarantee you.  

The service I feel was good but the communications leading up to the appointment was confusing and not clear.

199,"January 18, 2019","When purchasing a vehicle I was immediately greeted by sales men. “ how are you how may we help let’s make you smile! “ etc. Had to haggle and haggle with price as expected with me being a lower middle class citizen and not being able to afford an 800$ monthly payment. Long story short they gave me what I was hoping for and was a very very satisfied customer. 

A few months down the line, time for 5,000 mile service. 
The guy that greeted me in the service line started by laughing at me, telling me that they don’t give 330pm appointments which I had just confirmed around 100pm that day. He had short of told me to quit wasting his time and to go back out of line and come back another day.
 I assured him firmly that I had an appointment at said time and also asked him this which is what my review boils down to:

How come it is that when Toyota of El Cajon wants my down payment and monthly payments in their pocket the employees in charge of that do everything that can to make sure that they make a sale short of wiping my own behind, but now that I am in for service with the same vehicle, the guys on this side of the building are going to laugh at me and treat me like chopped liver and a lower class customer?

Bottom line is if you need to treat customers the same on day 100 as you did on day 1. Don’t treat me any more poor just because you got and are getting money out of me. Maybe it’s just an issue with that department ; But your business is only as good as your worst employee.",2.6

228,"October 31, 2018","No one likes going to a dealership... having that said, my Honey and I had the best experience anyone could have at the Toyota of El Cajon yesterday. 

What I thought would be a quick trip to the dealership to test drive both a 4 Runner and Highlander, turned into driving off the lot in a brand new car at the end of the day. 

We received nothing but VIP treatment from beginning to end;there were no questions unanswered and we never ever felt pressured or treated like a quota to fulfill. 

Ammar was exceptional in his customer service and attention to detail. He listened and carefully picked out the exact specifications for us to have the perfect vehicle for our needs. I've personally never owned a brand new car and I feel confident that Toyota of El Cajon was the BEST choice to purchase my first one. 

The establishment was clean. Every person we came across was professional. Although it is a stressful decision to spend so much money and commit to the next six years of our lives, since we have to have a car, we couldn't have chosen a better place. We opted for the 100k mile bumper to bumper add-on, and we have the two year maintenance so we will be able to experience the service side of the dealership. 

All things roll down and from owner to management to finance and sales floor, we were wow'd the whole way. Thank you to everyone for making this a smooth process. We will definitely recommend both the dealership and Ammar!",5.0

Their online service appointment scheduler is outstanding and allows you to schedule service efficiently.  When an appointment is made, they follow up and send you reminders.  Staff are friendly, no pressure, and professional.  Even got a call from Mr. Simeon Okosun over a year later to wish me a Happy Birthday!  A simple gesture but the remembrance and effort reflect highly on the Mr. Okosun and the total organization. Well done Mr. OKosun!!!!

Service bays are clean, well organized, and environmental controlled.  How do I know this?  Toyota El Cajon organized a new owners event after I purchased my vehicle from them.  So.... over a hundred of us got a catered dinner (no pretzels or peanuts, but tacos from a local restaurant), toured the entire facility, met the staff, and then had a raffle for prizes.  No small effort here, but still reflects well on the organization.  Total professionalism.   

Facilities are the best I've seen, clean, open, and environmental sound.  Definitely a Top Flight dealership.  Toyota and Toyota El Cajon are solid examples of a company operating to the highest standards of excellence.

Service Department is also stellar.  Ray Pelston went over the report and provided all documentation at the end.  They service vehicles efficiently considering the long lines to get in (arrived 20 minutes early for my appt, but the staff had my vehicle off to the bays on time).

After getting the car from it's check up, I notice the glove box door wasn't closing correctly, after further investigation the glove box door was off it's hinges and was dangling. I then notice the air cable filter cover was on the floor. When I got home I had to remove the glove box and install the cover and snap back the glove box door back on its hinges. I normally have ad pretty good service with Toyota of El Cajon but this time I wasn't impressed. The battery had to be replaced due to low voltage. Now mind you our Venza only has 63K miles and for a 2009 that is pretty good. Anyway I authorized the battery to be replaced. The battery was replaced at 50K miles so the battery only lasted 13K miles (a little over two years). The sales rep did give me a pro rate and it cost me ~$75 bucks.  The batteries at Wal-Mart last much longer than this battery and at a much lesser cost.  In all my visit was a fair rating. One more comment... I keep our Venza in immaculate condition and detailed very nicely including the engine compartment. My goal is to keep the car looking like new for many years to come.

497,"March 26, 2015","It is not often that I get to provide GOOD feedback on a car dealership…today is the day.  

To start, I should say that I was looking for a Toyota 4Runner, Trail, Premium, not a vehicle that is found in quantity in San Diego, in fact, there were was only one when I first started my search.
Working through United Services Automobile Association (USAA)’s Car Buying Service, there are only three Toyota Dealerships that USAA certifies; Toyota of El Cajon, Toyota of Poway and Toyota of Escondido.  Escondido offered the greatest discount, so I went there first and was treated to a very inconvenient and somewhat sloppy “Bait and Switch” routine (Yes, I have described the incident to USAA).  Next, and within $200 of the Escondido price, was Toyota of El Cajon, what a different dealership.

From the start, I was treated with respect and professionalism.  I had done my homework and knew the 4Runner, especially its off-road capabilities.  I was on alert for what I expected to be typical salesman “fluff” and was surprised when I got none.  My questions were answered with facts, not opinions and when my salesman didn’t know the answer, he said so and promptly found out the answer from their staff of experts.

Okay, so they are not feeding me what comes out of the South end of a bull walking North.  Now let’s find the specific 4Runner I want.  I knew that there were two in Los Angeles and three in Phoenix, but I really didn’t want to drive that far if I could help it.  After a thorough search by my salesman and his boss, they found what I was looking for, freshly build…but…in Japan. It was scheduled to arrive in El Cajon in three weeks.  They showed me the spec sheet and estimated delivery date.

I had a USAA buying Certificate which had a guaranteed price significantly below the MRSP.  Right up front, they honored the USAA Certificate and after nearly 4 hours of negotiating and haggling on my part, we agreed on a price.  It was so low that I thought “they will never actually sell me the inbound 4Runner for such a low price since the demand is high and supply low on 4Runners.  At the last minute, after I wait three weeks, there will be a ‘hidden extra cost’ that they ‘didn’t know about’, assuming that I will simply roll over and pay the extra cost since I waited so long”.  I signed no papers and neither did they.  They said that I would be notified when the 4Runner came in and they gave me their price work sheet with our agreed upon price.

Fast forward almost four weeks (not bad considering it came across the Pacific Ocean) the 4Runner shows up; I am called.  With all my mental alarms in high gear, I drove to the Dealership expecting the worst.  I was disappointed.  My salesman had all the paper work we had agreed upon and the price did not change one lick.  All the conditions I had insisted on were met and the 4Runner (nice and shiny) was waiting for me.  I even enjoyed going through the finance department for the final sign-off of the paperwork.  In a few hours, I was driving home my new 4Runner and I couldn’t have been more pleased.

A special thanks to Michael Farhat, Hiwa Knoshnaw (Michael’s boss) and even Jose Gomez (Finance Manager) for their composure, expertise and dedication to keeping me happy and relaxed.

When my wife decides it’s time to buy that Prius she wants so bad, guess where we’ll be going…

510,"August 15, 2014","Questions: What makes a business great? 

Answer: It is the ability to rectify a mistake and going the extra mile to accomplish this goal.  It is the fortitude and culture of a business to defend its good reputation by providing exemplary service to its customers. This is why I feel Toyota of El Cajon is a great business. They turned an unhappy customer into a loyal customer for life. For a car dealership, it is truly an extraordinary feat and high standard of ethics.

Initially, Toyota of El Cajon made certain statement regarding payment. However, due to low credit score, Toyota Finance charged a higher interest thereby causing the agreed upon payment to go up. Once, the owner of this family owned dealership, Gary Kaminsky became aware of this issue, he immediately took action. 

Gary, in fact, used his influence and persistence to get Toyota Finance to reverse their decision regarding the rate tier. Gary’s staff and managers work relentlessly with Toyota to resolve this issue. Sales manager, Paul Sphabixay, went above and beyond the call of duty to tenaciously remain involved until the matter was fully resolved. Ross, the sales person was a perfect gentleman and acted as such throughout the transaction. 

In the end, I was pleasantly surprised by the dealer’s steadfastness in making this car buying experience a perfect transaction. I would recommend this family owned dealership to my friends and family for a straightforward car buying experience. Off course, I shall return to this dealership whenever I need a new car.

519,"December 04, 2013","My wife and I decided to give Toyota of el Cajon a shot at our business. We had taken a couple of test drives with other dealers but the other dealers did not have the color and options we wanted. We made arrangements with Marwan Fakhoury (Sales Manager) to come in and test drive a specific car at a pre arranged price with the intent to purchase that night. We went into the dealership and we are assigned to Simeon Okosun. We started our test drive and once we reached the freeway I asked that we drive for a few miles as we were planning to buy this specific car in the next hour. Simeon told us that we needed to pull off at the next exit and we were only allowed to drive 1 exit before buying a brand new $28,000 car. I explained to Simeon that to feel comfortable spending this much money we wanted to drive at least 3-4 miles to feel comfortable. With my wife driving the vehicle she was already getting nervous with a man sitting behind her being very rude and abrupt with us and telling us to pull over and that the test drive was over. Personally, I understand that we came in at 8pm and the night was almost over but we had pre arranged the drive and purchase price already with the sales manager, it was a slam dunk sale for them as we and had cash in hand. 

Simeon said we were stupid to want to drive more than 1 exit and he had been doing this for 15 years and no one needs to drive more than 1 exit to test out a car. I told Simeon he was being extremely rude and acting like an as&ho&e. He proceeded to start yelling at both my wife and I that we were pieces of shi& and he made more money than us and he would bash our faces into the ground the moment he got out of the car, as well as his son was more obedient than us.... Needless to say he went from 0-crazy in a matter of seconds. After over 20 threats on our life and hitting the back seat and screaming at the top of his lungs at us.....all while I called his manager and had him on speaker phone the entire time for him to hear the exact threats he was making! I decided to call the police, who were dispatched to secure our safety. After the Sales Manager offered us to take the car as loaner, Laura Brewer the PR person from the dealership called to apologize. She was very nice and apologetic. I felt that the sales manager and PR person cared to apologize but I did wonder what the owner Greg Kaminsky thought about the situation. I was told that the owner would call a couple of days later. After 5 business days later and no call or care from the owner combined with the fact that I called the dealership today and found out that Simeon was rewarded with his behavior with only being suspended from work for a day and was able to keep his job, I decided to write this review. 

Simeon Okosun was allowed to threaten customers lives all while being on speaker phone with the sales manager and the only discipline he received was a day suspension. On top of that the owner was requested to contact me regarding the situation and he felt it was not worth his time. The very next day we went to Toyota of Carlsbad and purchased the very same car and were in and out of the dealership in 2 hours. I recommend that Toyota car buyers find any other Toyota dealership in San Diego other than El Cajon. ",1.0
520,"September 16, 2013","Simeon was very dishonest with me and my husband. We were looking to buy a 4runner and Simeon had assured us he had the vehicle in the color we wanted even though it didn't show up in the online inventory. We decided to drive around the lot to take a look at it. We didn't see it so we drove around to the back and we still couldn't find it. The next day my husband stopped by  to talk with Simeon personally. He was with a customer. When my husband let him know that he was there to look at the 4runner he said "" I am sorry I just sold it to the lady sitting at my desk"" Well that's okay. My husband asked to take a look at the vehicle anyway because he has only seen the ""blizzard white"" in photos. His excuse was that it was in the ""wash bay"" So he wasn't able to see it. My curious husband drove to the back anyway where they wash the cars and there was no 4runner anywhere. Then as my husband was leaving the dealership, he saw the same lady that he supposedly sold the 4runner to, get into her own vehicle and drive away. Simeon lied to us,  wasted our time and gas. He never had the vehicle to begin with. I also found out from an honest dealership that if it is not in the inventory, it is illegal to have for sale on the lot. I did not appreciate Simeon's dishonest sales tactics. I will definitely spend my 35k elsewhere.",1.0
521,"September 10, 2013","About a month ago, my dad and I accompanied my grandma to purchase a new car from this dealership. As we drove up to the front, we saw three well-dressed gentlemen standing there. We were initially a little afraid that they might all, well, jump on us in a sort. However, that was not the case.

One of the men strolled over to us and introduced himself as Michael Bojorquez as he took the time to shake each of our hands and learn our names. Then, he got straight down to business, asking my grandma why she had come to Toyota of El Cajon. She, naturally, responded that she wanted to purchase a new car and then added she was interested in looking at a Camry. Michael led us over to their selection of Camrys and my grandma seemed to fixate on a black one. Michael was so knowledgeable about that specific car, but also about the Camrys in general. However, my grandma said despite all the great features the car displayed, she really, above anything, wanted a sun/moon roof. So, Michael guided our group over to the Corollas.

Again, my grandma went over to a black one and Michael once again gave us all the information on the car and the Corollas. My grandma decided she wanted to give it a test drive and Michael quickly went to get the keys. On our drive, Michael offered even more facts about the Corolla and pointed out things like how easy it was to drive and how smooth its ride was, all while navigating us on a course back to the dealership and while chatting to the rest of our group. 

After the test drive, my grandma was eager to purchase the car. Michael showed us inside and to his desk. Before he even sat down, he offered us all refreshments, which we graciously accepted. 

While we were closing the deal on the car, Michael and his manager never seemed like they were trying to slide things in that would cost more money and the end price was more than reasonable. We never once felt like we were being taken advantage of and both men were up to negotiate price and conditions. 

Afterwards , Michael showed us around the dealership, which was so impressive! Then, he guided us over to a waiting lounge while we waited to speak with the financial officer and for our car to be ""spiffed up"". It was a bit of a wait to be honest, but the officer made up for any inconvenience with his professionalism. 

Once all the paperwork was completed and our car was ready, Michael rejoined us. He asked if we had any further questions and just double checked to make sure my grandma knew how to operate all the features of the Corolla.

529,"March 24, 2013","While the staff at Toyota of El Cajon has always been helpful, it is Omed that brought me back. I first met Omed in 2011 when I purchased my RAV4. After a recent accident I brought my RAV in to Toyota EC to see if I could trade it. Omed worked with me and did everything possible to get me into another vehicle that I felt comfortable in. He was never pushy in all the times I have dealt with him, and is very attentive and compassionate. Unlike car salesmen from other dealerships, Omed and the staff of Toyota EC do not feed you bull s*%# to get you to buy the car. If Omed left Toyota EC, I would most likely follow him to another dealership. He is a huge asset and the main reason why I went back to Toyota EC. ",5.0

We had also discovered that there was an incorrect battery installed in the car [battery was too small], so we had bought a new one, and Toyota reimbursed us for the battery AND the tow.

564,"June 26, 2012","I have been to 3 other dealers in SD over the past several years and have walked away because of the high pressure job from their salesmen.  We knew what we wanted to look at and came into Toyota of El Cajon rather defensively because of the experience we had the day before.  We were in for a pleasant surprise.

I had called the day before to ask about the truck we were looking for, so when I called today and said I'd be in in 30 mintues, it was sitting out front waiting for us to test drive.  Ryan met us and without a lot of chit chat, took us out on a test drive.  He calmly answered all our questions as we were driving.  

As we were signing papers, Ryan took them back to have the manager sign off, only to find out that there was a major problem.  The truck had been mismarked.  By a LOT.  The manager was unable to authorize the sale or get ahold of the owners to find out what to do, so they promised us they would put the truck in the back, and call us as soon as they had spoken with the owners. Ryan made sure no one else could show it.  Ryan called us with the good news the next day that the owners had the integrity to keep their word on the truck, even though they lost quite a bit of money on the deal.  

During the entire process we never felt any pressure, but rather the opposite - that they were going to do their best to try to make this work.  Having a salesperson who we felt was working for our benefit even though he was now not going to make any commission, and owners that stood behind their word, gave us confidence that we were dealing with a car dealership where integrity and honesty were part of their mission -not just making money

Thank you so much, Toyota of El Cajon.  You will be our 'go to' car dealer from now on.  We won't even have to go through the pain of searching other dealerships.  When we want a car, or need parts or service, we will be here even though it is not the closest dealer in town! You are a 5 in our book for the obvious reasons listed above!

I was treated with courtesy and prompt professional follow up from the first call I made before driving out to El Cajon all the way through to today, the day after I drove my new car home. Even if you live no where near this dealership, it is worth your while to make the trip.
   I tried 2 other Toyota dealerships closer to my home first and at both was treated as if I knew nothing. When I explained I had done my research prior to arrival, I was questioned about it and basically made to feel that I was lying. 
   Toyota of El Cajon respected me from the first moment, made me a very fair and honest deal, stuck to their word and won me as a customer for life. I look forward to returning for replacement of my other car in about 18-24 months and also returning for service. If the service is half as good as the sales department I will never have my car serviced anywhere else. 
   I want to personally thank Jackie, Fernando, Bill and most of all Tony Butler, and all of the other friendly faces I saw there. Keep up the good work!

581,"November 20, 2011","I went to this dealership because I saw highly rated reviews on internet. But I got a big surprise...

Summary: I originally went there to have them estimate my car for a trade-in value, and get a quote for a new corolla because I am planing to buy one within a few weeks. I accidentally left my driver license at home. They had me drive back home(20 min one way), and told me to come back when I'm actually ready to buy. They did not even give me a trade-in value I came in for. Great customer service.

More detail: before I went, I made an appointment with Hiwa, and when I got there, another guy called Michael sand ""hi, I'm Hiwa"". I kept thinking he was Hiwa, until I saw his name tag when he handed his business card. I don't have to talk to Hiwa (since I've never met anyway), but what kind of person would say ""I'm Hiwa"" to my face with his name tag saying ""Michael""? I am not a 3 year old. Michael also tried to have another sales person to deal with me, but he refused to do it as soon as I told him I'm not buying today. Michael also told me the deal I saw on their website isn't there by showing me a different web page showing $15,999 more on the price. I came home and still see the deal $15,199 on your website! Don't lie to me. ""Come back when you are ready to buy""? Do you think I'll come back and buy from someone who lied his name? NEVER! No matter what deal you give me. Actually, I already got a better deal than $15,199 (which they never gave me anyway, just say so on the website) from another Toyota in town. Bye-bye, Toyota of El Cajon.",1.2

589,"September 27, 2011","My husband and I purchased a used 2011 Chevy Malibu from Toyota of El Cajon on Sunday.... We did not have a very good experience. The car we got did not have all of the features that we were told that it had. Upon reading our manual and going thru the steps to use the features the next day we noticed that the blue tooth, XM radio and On Star were not equipped like we were told.  We got a call and were told that we had to bring the car back in the next day because the car had an oil leak and was not suppose to be sold because it had to go to another dealership to be looked at. When we brought the car back in and my husband explained that the features were not in it as the salesman said they were. The salesman came over and still was trying to say that the car had the features. Luckily the service guy said that the car did not have the features and He said that they would check it out and see what they can do and that they would be sending it to the Chevy dealer to have the oil leak looked at..  They still have the car and we were told that the car we just spent $19664.90 on Sunday evening   doesn’t actually have an oil leak it is just a little seepage so they won’t need to fix it..... I just can’t feel really good about a $19664.90 car without the features that I was told it had and the has a little seepage.....The sad thing is that the features that we were suppose to have gotten were on the sticker of the car, I know because I have the copy of the sticker on the car.  I think this is common practice because online right now they have cars that say they have features that they are not equipped with.... IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A CAR NEW OR USED I WOULD NOT RECOMEND GOING TO TOYOTA OF EL CAJON OR ANY OF THEIR AFFILIATES. THEIR ARE SO MANY PLACES TO PURCHASE A CAR IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY, I AM SURE THAT THEIR ARE DEALERSHIPS THAT WILL TAKE CARE OF THEIR CUSTOMERS BETTER TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR SALESMEN ARE NOT SELLING FEATURES THAT THEIR CARS DO NOT HAVE.

Right from the start he was friendly, professional, had a great sense of humor  and never pressured us once. He seemed very dependable and made us feel very at home and comfortable. I really have nothing bad to say about his service except that i wish we could have negotiated the price a little more. The sticker price seemed set in stone which was kind of a bummer, but i dont fault him for that because i think it was his managers call. other then that little hiccup i thought our experience could not have been better.

When i picked out the car that i wanted we went over the car and he knew every answer to every question i had which showed that he had experience in selling cars. When we went inside to work out the deal Omed introduced me to Marwan who was very nice and curtious as well as professional.

Omed and Marwan work excellent as a team and they both listen to your concerns and what you expect to get out of buying a new car and they give you just that i could not ask for better service. The next day after i bought the car Omed called and asked me how i liked my car and if the car was doing fine i wish that every salesperson cared about the product they sold and also cared about how their customer felt about the purchase and their feelings.

It turned out to be our best car shopping experience in years. Actually, they were the second car dealer we visited that day and they provided us the best customer service by far. When we arrived at their car lot, we were greeted courteously by one of their sales consultants, Martin Garrett. He was very professional with the right personal touch of making you feel at ease and he was never “pushy”. He was very knowledgeable and he answered all the questions we had to our satisfaction. In hindsight, all the people that we come into contact that day at the dealership like Robert Hans and Gustav Proka were the same. Their credit application process was a breeze compared to the other Toyota dealer that we went to. We didn’t have to waste any paper or ink because Martin just entered all our pertinent info directly into their computer. Toyota of El Cajon really got it right as far as customer service and satisfaction is concern. From the simple gesture of asking us customers if we wanted any refreshments (we opted for water) to patiently explaining to us the nuances and features of our newly bought vehicle, they were the best in customer service.

When I first arrived to the dealer I started looking and was not preyed upon by any salesman for at least 15 minutes. I was then greeted by Robert Petty who was more interested in selling me the car I wanted then he was about how much money I had or made.  After meeting Robert's boss, (who's name I forgot) they both worked as a team to help the deal go quick and painless.  They were both very easy to deal with and did not try and get me to agree to anything I was not comfortale with.  After a handshake on a deal, came the ever painful and boring financing signing part.  Usually it's very bland but from the moment I was introduced to Ying, the process was very quick and easy, and fun which was not expected.  Her attitude was positive and great and she had a great sense of humor which made it alot easier then any other dealership.  After some funny conversations the paper's were all signed and I was out the door in no time.  Ying is very good at what she does and she has fun doing it which isn't something I've ever seen.  Unfortunately I got hit the next day in my car which was not fun.  I had to drop off some keys from the car I traded in and each one of these people came out and shook my hand and asked if I was okay.  Not something I expected but if it turns out that my vehicle is totaled, I will be back and will hopefully get to deal with Robert, his boss, and Ying again.

Not with Paul; he greeted me outside the front door and went right to work.  

Robert Hans showed me several financing options, and was quick to address my concerns about interest rates, the term of the loan, and the value of my trade-in.

I already knew that my truck was on the dealer's lot because their inventory is online, but even if they didn't have it yet, I would have waited for them to get it because Paul was so knowledgeable, and because Robert gave me a deal that was acceptable to me.

Ying Pan went over all of the paperwork, answered all of my questions, and made sure I understood everything.

This is my 3rd time buying a new vehicle (my 3rd new Toyota truck in 20 years), and the experience I got at Toyota of El Cajon was the best of the 3.  Everyone I dealt with at Toyota of El Cajon was very friendly and very detail-oriented.

The car was delivered as promised, in every respect.  2. Negotiation was easy, honest and fair; we are satisfied.

648,"February 16, 2011","After signing up with pricequotes.com some other equivalent online site I was first contacted over the phone by Ross Miran who was very nice and he offered very competitive pricing beating a good deal I was going to get from Toyota of San Diego.  I first test drove the car at Toyota of San Diego. I would have worked with them and likely bought one there but they didn't have the model/color I wanted. Ross confirmed that they had the color(at least the one I thought I wanted at the time Pre-Dawn Mica) so that's what brought me to Toyota of El Cajon.  Their inventory was much larger.  I also thought the facility was nice too.  They had a play area for the kids(pirate ship, my son liked that), and a movie room for kids.  I thought the free snacks and water was a nice touch as well.  When I arrived Ross had the day off so I worked with Ernesto who was very nice and took me on another test drive, this time with my wife.  He answered all of our questions and took the time to show us all the features of the minivan. I had asked to see a car with the Cypress Pearl color because I hadn't seen one yet so he took us into one of their garages and we found one but it was in a lower trim line that what I was interested in.  After seeing it we really liked that color but they didn't have one like we wanted.  Ernesto called me back and told me he would find me the one I wanted and he did.  A few days later he made a trade with another dealership and got me the car I wanted.  When it came to financing I was surprised that your financing dept was able to better the rate I was getting from my credit union but Anna Caruso made it happen.  I came into the deal not knowing exactly how the process worked and wasn't prepared with a cashiers check ready for the down so I thought she great in letting us put the down on our credit cards.  I appreciate her efforts in helping us get around this(rather than having me go back to my bank and having to come back another day to get the car.

We were looking at Kia Souls and Scion XBs. Found a gently used 2010 XB on the Toyota lot via AutoTrader.com. Was approached by Paul to show us the vehicle and take it for a test drive. He was an easy going and professional guy which made the whole experience much more pleasant. (The stress of buying a car on my weekend off isn't the first thing I like to sign up for!)

His sincerity and non aggressive approach put me at ease immediately so that I could concentrate on why I was there; to buy a new car. His knowledge, expertise and personable demeanor made my decision very easy and quick. I have never been so happy! 
Next, I was assisted by Aleks with the paperwork which we breezed through. I was later escorted to an office where the kind hearted Colette really eased the final blow ""The payment."" She really was truly an amazing human being! I have never been so happy with my customer service. This is the fifth Toyota my family and I have purchased and hands down the best customer service.

My wife and I had been planning to buy a new car. We were not sure what car that would be. We only knew we wanted a car that was from a trustful manufacturer and, definitely, Toyota was among the two or three we wanted. Once we were there, Ernesto was so friendly and helpful that we felt confident about what he was saying to us. He sounded so honest that he made us feel confident about the car we were about to buy.  He showed several options to us so we could be sure that the choice we were making was the right one. We were looking for a family car and we got this 2009 white Toyota Corolla LE that that would run so easy and smooth that made me feel comfortable while driving. I also liked that the view does not get blocked when changing lanes for I feel sure and confident when I drive it. Ernesto also showed us the big list of interesting characteristics the car features, all with the purpose to make us feel comfortable. Ernesto even called me three times in the following days to make sure everything was right with our new acquisition. I had already driven to LA and I had not been able to use the Cruise Control for I told Ernesto when HE CALLED ME. He invited me to visit him at Toyota El Cajon and he came outside to show me how to use it. It was really easy. Actually, a few days later, I received a call from Ana, who told us they had found a better interest rate for us and we ended having a better deal than the original. I am very pleased with my new car. Ernesto, Thanks a lot.

The salesmen are friendly and NEVER pressure you into a purchase. With this purchase my salesmans name was Simeon, I was able to browse any and all vehicles I wantedand the salesman never made me feel as if I was wasting his time.  The lobby is clean and inviting, refreshments are avaliable and they have the most amazing play area for kids .. its an actual pirate ship that the kids can climb all over.  

The finance department was just as nice to deal with, and I loved thier ""open door"" I could actually see them.  Not like some dealers who hide behind a door whre the salesman discuss the deal in secret.  I was openly involved in the finance process. The manager was happy to give me a quote on any vehicle I wished without hesitation or the look of annoyance.  

After my finance was complete I was met by Colette to finalize and sign all necessary documents. She laid everything out and explained in detail, I knew and understood exactly was I was signing. She was very professional and at the same time personable.

I will forever recomend TOYOTA OF EL CAJON to all my family, friends, co-workers and anyone elese who will listen

The best part was that Dennis really worked with my husband and myself to come up with the deal that would work for our budget, yet allow us to each get a car that made each of us extremely happy!

After a long day at Hyundai trying to work out a price for the 2010 genesis coupe v6 with no luck, i went to Toyota of El Cajon to see what they had. All i wanted from Hyundai was the $500 military rebate, but they said i didnt qualify because i was a reservist. Anyways, Aleks greeted me and showed me around the lot. we looked at corollas, camrys, venza, tundras and didnt find much. Before i left, i saw the sticker price on the tC and i was surprised. Scion/toyota had $1000 off MSRP...maybe to get rid of their 2010 models and make room for their 11's. Plus, they gave me $1000 military rebate on top of that. I got $2,000 off the price on the spot. No games, no hassle, no bs. They got all the numbers done, showed me the price, and sent me to the finance office. i read so many bad things and to beware of the finance specialist. Linda wasn't pushy and basically didnt try and screw me over. The whole process was simple and stress-free. i would do business with Toyota of El Cajon again, no doubt.

My wife and I were interested in purchasing a used Sienna initially, but we were also considering leasing a new one. Our sales associate, Rene Wolfe (also assisted by Paul), was incredibly patient with us and explained all our options carefully. We test drove both a used and new Sienna and discussed the various pricing options for each. We ended up leasing a new vehicle that was well within our budget and certainly left more than satisfied with our purchase. In our opinion, Rene went above and  beyond what we had expected and certainly ""wowed"" us with customer service. In addition, our interaction with Sergio G. in finance was just as pleasant. In our experience, that's definitely not the norm at car dealerships. You've certainly earned a customer for life! 
 
Aside from the quality service, we also enjoyed the facility as well. My kids loved the pirate ship playground and it kept them well entertained while we discussed options and signed paperwork. The coffee and snacks helped with the long hours as well. Lastly, the price we paid for our Sienna was definitely a value in comparison to the overall quality of the vehicle. We've had it now for about two weeks and love it more each day.

772,"August 29, 2010","Yesterday I leased a new Prius II, 2010 at Toyota of El Cajon.
I got an amazing lease agreement on the exact car that I wanted.

I was quite impressed with my salesman Khar Vun.
Khar (pronounced ""car"") went literally out of his way to drive me to and from the dealership - my old car was in the shop - and Khar was all about customer first.  
I felt comfortable that Khar would get me the very best deal and make certain I was treated with respect by all else (financing, etc.) during my meetings at the dealership.  Khar gets all ""A's"" for his customer service, test drive, friendliness, honesty, integrity, and ""go to it"" attitude.

I am so excited about my gorgeous new Prius!
I have a feeling I will become addicted to the amazing MPG on this tec-advanced vehicle.  During the test drives (2) I was getting, most of the drive, 75-100 MPG!
The digital dash shows exactly how much fuel the driver is using and and how much battery.  It really is astonishing.  It empowers the driver in a way that revolutionizes driving.

Thanks so much to Khar for making this lease a positive experience.
I recommend him as the guy to call when interested in any Toyota lease or purchase.
In fact, here is the dealership phone number (ask for Khar): (619)270-3000

The manager named Lou connected me to my salesman and I am quite impressed with Lou and his mangement style and ability to interface with the clients.  Good job Lou.  You won me as a client with your readiness to accomodate my needs and connecting me with a salesman that was committed to keeping me satisfied with this transaction.

By the way, I had gone the day before to a different Toyota dealership nearer to my home in San Diego...I felt belittled and manipulated by the manager/finance rep. there...and I had gone in with the idea to sign on the dotted line.
I ended that connection as quickly as possible.
Fortunately, the next morning I got a phone call from Lou at Toyota of El Cajon (the good place) the next morning and he was ready to do anything it took to help me...

Thanks for asking about my experience at Toyota of El Cajon. I am very impressed with Toyota of El Cajon and feel quite fortunate to have purchased my vehicle from your sales associate, Bryan Williams.  And after shopping other dealerships and listening to other salesmen, I feel like I saw many areas where both Toyota of El Cajon and Bryan Williams are distinctive in this business.  

 

 I spent Saturday afternoon at Mossy Toyota in Pacific Beach.  It was my first stop and, for that reason,  I had a lot of questions regarding the details of leasing or purchasing a car.  While my salesman did his best, I left with more questions than I had when I entered the showroom.  When I called back for clarification, I could not reach my initial salesman and ended up talking to a man completely disinterested in what he must had considered a remedial conversation on the topic. He didn't want to talk to me on the phone and continued to say that I needed to come to the showroom to have my questions fully answered.   I hung up and knew that I would not go back to that dealership.

 

On Sunday morning, I sat at my computer attempting to do my own research on the topic of leasing a car.  I visited the webpage of several San Diego dealerships.  In each case, I left my phone number and e-mail address and asked that someone contact me regarding the specific car that I was interested in purchasing or leasing.  I believe that Bryan called me within minutes.  What I found unique about Bryan was his willingness to talk to me on the phone.  I imagine that it is customary to specifically focus on getting a phone contact into the showroom.  Bryan's focus was on answering my questions.  We spent quite a bit of time talking about lease options and when I hung up from the conversation, I felt that I clearly understood the process.  I felt no pressure whatsoever to come into the showroom, just a comfortable invitation from Bryan to visit Toyota of El Cajon if I continued to be interested in the options available to me.  As a single woman, I was wary about shopping for a car without a male because actual studies have proven that a male is most often offered a better price on a car than a female is offered.  Bryan made me comfortable enough that I e-mailed him and asked if I could come to the showroom on Monday afternoon.  

 

During our time together, Bryan and I revisited the details that we talked about on the phone.   I was provided documentation on the specific Corolla that I was interested in owning along with the financial options available to me.  Bryan also talked to me about the Prius and encouraged me to test drive both vehicles.  After my test drives, I was equally impressed with the two vehicles and needed more information and time to think about my choice.   I never felt hurried or pressured to come to a decision.  Other car salesmen that I talked to seemed only interested in getting my signature on their documents.  Bryan gave me the space to make a good decision for me. 

 

I enjoyed the tour of your beautiful, new facility.   Every department appears well designed for the comfort of your customers.  I do not have small children, but I imagine that those who do are thrilled with the play equipment and child-friendly atmosphere.  The waiting area for those having service on their cars is spectacular.  I did not see anything quite like that in the other dealerships.  I love it that you offer a green facility where possible.  I'm impressed.  

 

I am appreciative of Bryan's patience and professionalism.   His efforts on behalf of Toyota of El Cajon not only sold a car, but also sold me on the service department.   I live on Point Loma and will happily make the drive to El Cajon for any service necessary on my car.  I will recommend Toyota of El Cajon and, specifically, Bryan Williams to anyone shopping for a new car.  

 

Sincerely,

Jan Johnson

Purchased a new car from El Cajon Toyota. Folks were great during the sales and finance process. Really liked Bryan Williams (Internet Sales) and his knowledge of the product. Collete (Finance) was also very helpful and professional. It was by far the best car buying experience ever.

805,"July 24, 2010","I am back...and For Good Reason...Last month I purchased a 2010 Toyota Corolla from Toyota of El Cajon. We are very happy with the vehicle, the people and the service which brings me to why I am back. Right after we got my wife a new vehicle my PT Cruiser was hit in front of my house by a DUI Driver while I slept at 3 in the morning. 
Needless to say I was now out a vehicle and did not look forward to looking for a new car or dealing with a dealership to get a replacement car. I tried to reach Fernando at Toyota of El Cajon but he was on vacation so I left a message for Natasha, she was not in till 2:00. I took this waiting time to test drive a couple of cars from the competitors...not a fun experience. I wasn't finding what I wanted at the price I was looking for. I immediately knew where I should be and it was now 2:00. I called Toyota of El Cajon and explained my situation to Natasha Lind, excuse me, Natasha Rowles the Finance Manager and much, much more. She forwarded me to Frank Marquez, as Fernando Aguiniga was on vacation. Frank called me and asked what I was looking for, I told him the 3 models I was interested in and he said, ""I will have them ready for you when you arrive."" To make things short I Leased a 2010 Prius at the price I was asking for and everyone involved reminded me why I called This Toyota dealership first.
The ability to listen to My needs and patiently assist me through the car buying experience speaks volume. 
Frank...Keep on smiling, Natasha...well, just keep doin what you are doin, it works, and I can not forget Jose in service...he defines the word service.

806,"July 18, 2010","I visited and spoke to several Toyota Dealerships before contacting El Cajon Toyota.  I was interested in a specific
color and type of vehicle and made this clear to my telephone contact at this dealership.  He told me that he either had the vehicle that I wanted or was about to get the exact vehicle that I wanted.  

When I arrived he showed me a similar vehicle to what I wanted and asked if I wanted to drive it.  I reiterated that I had already test drove the vehicle elsewhere and only needed to get a specific color and leather package.  He asked me to sign a loan application to check my credit rating even before he could deliver the car I wanted.

Needless to say we had a total lack of communication and I left immediately....I have
never been asked to sign a loan application before agreeing on a purchase. Perhaps this was a gross misunderstanding but I thought I was very clear in presenting my
shopping goals. ",4.4

Jose is friendly & professional and helpful. If you don't have a regular service guy see if you can get assigned to him. He is the bomb!
My only complaint is that they charge dealer prices. My always-on running lights were not on. They had to charge me a diagnostic fee of $95 to tell me that it was a burned out lightbulb which left the circuit opened and that's why both lights were out. So basically I paid nearly $100. to change a light bulb. ",5.0

My son was able to stay busy with the items in the lobby from a huge pirate ship for him to play on to the kids theater TV area. The reason for the 4 out of five on price is we got a REWIND car, Sold and than returned with 1600 miles on it. I was not aware of this until signing the contract when Natasha Lind the Finance Manager asked if we were aware that the car was being sold as USED. My wife loves the car, but if we knew this fact I would have negotiated a few dollars off, throw in a better additional coverage package or requested what I get what I thought I was purchasing, A new car. seeing as I was paying the full new car price. It was late and we had been there a while and my son was ready to go so we took it as is. I can only hope this was an oversight and not done knowingly.

I have a 1989 Toyota pickup with only 255000 miles and they wouldn't wash it because it has a non-retractable radio antenna.
