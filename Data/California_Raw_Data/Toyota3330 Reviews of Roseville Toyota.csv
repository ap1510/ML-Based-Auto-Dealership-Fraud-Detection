0,"May 11, 2020","Hello,
I unfortunately didn't have the best experience. I was treated unfairly (racial profiling) with the staff who check you out for your car from service/parts. I am a black woman and there were two clients ahead of me who weren't black. I also was not acknowledged by the lady working the kiosk for checking out. I also received my car last when I was ahead of another customer. When my car arrived I was asked to show my paper confirming the number (in order to receive my car). If the young lady was following protocol by confirming that is totally fine but the issue is, the other two clients were not asked e same questions. They were confronted with the words ""is this your car, is the camry for you"" . I then asked that same lady (who didn't help me) ""is that protocal for you guys to confirm the numbers/paperwork etc.?"" She replied "" oh yes we have to ask everyone because there were incidents where other people (relatives) drove off with their uncles car etc. (she was referencing an incident). I then replied "" how come the other to clients who got their car prior to me were not asked those questions?"" She then replied "" oh uhh I its because I thought he looked familiar I seen his face"", but she did this with both customers. She then goes on apologizing and said they are supposed to.  

I felt uncomfortable and felt I was being racially profiled by your staff. I was a bit bothered that I ended up having to give my  money away to an establishment who treats minorities this way. I won't be returning unfortunately due to this experience as well. I know it may not seem like ""a big deal"" but this it is something that us minorities have to sadly face on a daily basis throughout this nation. They should be told they need to follow protocol and follow that accordingly to all races and treating everyone fair, otherwise it is going to hurt the business/loss of customers.

1,"April 26, 2020","Nobody took the time to show me how the features of the truck work, so I am guessing and using the instruction manual the best I can. A little to many emotions on the sales side in my opinion causing them to be a bit over the top and pushy. I understand the stresses of the job so I can sympothize, still irratating though. Like the truck good product.",3.0

7,"February 29, 2020","If I could leave no stars, I would. Initially went there on a Sunday, made a deal fairly quickly and was out of the door faster than expected with the car I wanted. It went smooth and I thought wow this place changes perceptions of dealerships. 14 days later, received a letter...a letter not a call...that the lease deal that we worked out fell through and that I needed to return the car. We called several times, spoke with several different finance managers who said they’d like to renegotiate...then another told us a different thing, then another told us a different thing. Left work early on a weekday to try and work something out - something a finance manager said would work if we headed that way (mind you were are 1.5 hours away). So we go that way, we wait for about an hour for anyone to even acknowledge us and then another hour or so to find out their solution actually wasn’t going to work. Our trade in vehicle wasn’t even on site anymore so we had to drive another 1.5 hours back another day to do the swap of cars. Upon coming back
That last day to return the car, we were swapped between sales people to sales people with no inclination of what we were trying to do. Finally, someone tells us they have our file and then another sales person comes to me to ask me if I’d like to get a 2015 used Lexus with 150k miles on it instead of the 2020 Camry I thought I leased. Then he comes back to ask if I wanted a corolla or a 2017 Camry LE. Knowing I already had a 2017 Camry SE, he then tells me the car I was trying to lease was too much and that I wasn’t worthy of it. 2 hours of wasted time to sign 3 documents to return a car. Grateful I went to another Toyota the next day and was able to lock in a purchase deal on the same car I wanted. These people had no empathy, no customer service, and overall just negligent, judgmental and don’t care. ",1.0

10,"October 23, 2019","Over my 65 years of buying vehicles I have alway had a follow up with a thanks for choosing our business and how do you like your new purchase..  It's been over 5 weeks and so much for my expectations. My wife was given a price and then I came in to buy the truck at that price 45 minutes later that price was off the table?? We did buy and I was okay with the final price. I like the idea of buying locally and marked yes on recommendation because I have bought from them in the past with positive deal.  I just didn't like spending almost $27,000 and not hearing something like, ""We appreciate your business"".",2.0

33,"January 21, 2019","Online booking does not provide service package prices. Scheduler did not call back as promised with cost and detail information. Service representative was not warm and welcoming, rather had an attitude of just having to do their job. No guidance or advice given on service options. Service representative did not call with update as promised. I had to call to check on my vehicle status. I had chosen the more costly option only to come in and find that my vehicle was in good condition and did not need any of that service, yet I was not offered a discount or additional services to offset the cost. In review of my final statement I saw that the service representative took it upon themselves to input that I declined a wash when it was never offered to me. This was even more upsetting when I paid for the higher service that turned out not to be needed. Again at checkout I did not feel like a valued customer. This was my first service since moving to California. My experience was very disappointing especially for the amount I paid. I do not wish to return. ",2.2

38,"January 21, 2019","My wife and I used the True Car app to figure out pricing and availability locally, and then we were connected with a local dealer/internet sales department. We made an appointment to visit and from that point it was a breeze. We already knew what model we wanted so it was a matter of color and trim level and options. That part is a little tricky so be prepared with questions and do some research before hand. The whole experience from beginning to end was professional, no hassle, and no pressure. This was pretty much a stress free transaction. As always the paperwork is the worst part of any auto transaction, but this went smoothly too. Great job by Jason Seiff and Derek Leggins in finance.",4.7
39,"January 21, 2019","I came to Toyota not knowing what, why, or when. I had an amazing salesman by the name of Vince Pierce put all of my fears, questions, and doubts to rest. He truly was personable, knowledgeable, and professional. He took away my what, why and when and transformed it into a 2019 Toyota Corolla SE, because it's new, sleek, reliable, and cost effective and TODAY you will be a NEW Toyota Car Owner! Fantastic!!!!",5.0

51,"January 19, 2019","This is a follow up review, but it has not changed what so ever. This service center has zero communication with each other. It took them three days to release my car, even though I paid for my bill. They delayed everything, and then when I called to ask them why it wasn’t being released; they said it was because of the bill. Even though I had already paid for it. The manager mike, then instead of taking to me, decided to play telephone and relay messages instead of talking to me. They did not value me as a customer. Apparently buying a new car and helping me get it fixed means nothing to these people. ",1.8
52,"January 19, 2019","Went in for just an oil change. Told it would be about an hour. After an hour was informed that they had drained my transmission fluid on accident. My two issues with this. First, I feel that it is a safety issue having such lack of attention to detail. Second, with that happening it turned my wait time from one hour to about three and a half hours. My appointment was scheduled at 7 am and I did that for a reason. After my appointment I had a lot of things I had to take care of so I wanted to get my truck service taken care of and out of the way.

With all that said. The service advisor was really great and understanding and did her best keeping me informed. Unfortunately I forgot her name but she had red hair if that’s helpful. Just want to make sure she gets kudos.

I won’t stop coming because it was just a mistake but I do feel like it should be noted and corrected.

Thank you,

67,"January 18, 2019","Let me first say my experience with sale rep Ed was good. I Bought a car, fantastic experience. Drove it home and engine seized. They took it back that night, gave me rental. Went back the following weekend to deal with getting new car. Ended up paying more money for a lesser car, dried the whole time. I originally bought a 2015 Prius three, blue in color with 73,000 miles so I bought extended warranty. I felt great about purchase. When I went back to get the new vehicle I got $400 off a 2015 Prius 2 with 35262 miles, hate the color, didn’t get taken care of for the inconvenience, registration is due in a month, and all I was repeatedly told was how good the mileage was. I wasn’t given the option to keep my car with the new engine in it. I wasn’t mad or angry at the situation cause I know people make mistakes. But going back in and not being taken care of, Crying the entire time and leaving the dealership with a car I didnt want and paying more money has put a very bad taste in my mouth.

The next morning I started the car and tire pressure light on the dash came on. This light never has come on before. All the tires appear to be inflated properly. I assume that since the rear tires were removed for the brake job, that maybe there was a issue with one of the TP sensors on the rear wheels. I called my service advisor (Cory Lunsford)  to see if I could bring the car back in to have someone see if one of the sensors was  damaged during the brake job. He advised me that I would have to pay for at least an hour labor (well over $100)! I said that I was not was willing to pay well over $100 if they somehow damaged a sensor during the brake job and called my usual Toyota dealership (Maita) and they told me to bring the car in and they would be happy to take a look at it. I don’t mind paying for needed work (I paid over $300 for the brake job on only one axle!) but I refuse to pay for a something  that was caused by one of their own mechanics.

He called to give me an update and then didn’t have the information and left me on hold until I hung up and called back. This visit I prepared the appointment setter with the reason I was coming in and my expectations. I came in 30 minutes early to take advantage of the shuttle, but that didn’t matter because the detailed reason for the appointment was never communicated to advisor. So a 4 hour appointment turned into a request to leave my vehicle overnight and perhaps it would be completed by Monday afternoon!

My car had been running fine but 1 day after their unnecessary multi point inspection my check engine light is on and my car will not start. Even though they had told me that everything looked good from their inspection. I believe they did something on purpose to my vehicle so that I would have to bring it back for repairs.

203,"January 03, 2019"," I recently just bought a new 2019 Toyota Tacoma TRD 4x4 from Roseville Toyota in the auto mall.  I have to say the experience was one to remember.  Don’t get me wrong.  It was not bad at all..  In fact it was one of the easiest car buying experiences I have ever had.  In and out in a few hours.  I DO recommend you do your home work before buying. I went through the internet sales manager Sam Sarwari.  I also recommend going through this method.  It seems they can make you a better deal.  Be sure to ask for any rebates or incentives.  Sam was very easy to talk to he didn’t put pressure on me like some dealers do and worked very hard to make sure I got the vehicle I was looking for.  Everything on it and more at a fair price.  In fact the entire staff were very helpful and able answer the questions I had From Steve in the finance department to Marina Korneyenko from Customer Relations.  At the end of the sale she was went over all the details about my new truck.  How things worked, what button did what, pretty much everything.  I drove off the lot smiling and happy.  NOT feeling, “did I do the right thing and get what I wanted?’.  Well…YES…I feel I did.  Car buying isn’t always the most enjoyable of experiences and of course no one wants to spend an entire day just trying to get a new vehicle.  It was nice to drive off and feeling excited and not exhausted.   So …IF you are thinking about buying a new car or truck in the future, I highly recommend Roseville Toyota in the auto mall.",4.8

323,"December 22, 2018","
I was escorted inside and introduced to Ms. Huey who said, ""I'll be right with you"". 

I noticed she appeared irritated, as her tone was short and snappy. I could see the location was busy.

When Rebekah was done typing, I was not greeted as I have been accustomed to in all my dealings with the service center. She made our interaction very tense, unwelcoming, and uncomfortable. I don't consider myself sensitive to noticing these things, but this was blatantly obvious. 

Rebekah proceeded to ask me if I had an appointment today.

I said, ""no"".  

She responded, ""well then it's gonna be a couple hours. Is your maintenance light even on?""

I said, ""Yes, the light is on"". I remained calm and polite.

I never asked her what the duration of my service would be since I don't wait on site for my vehicle to be finished. 

She informed me an oil change was due at 10,000 miles. 

""Do you want to call us, or should I  preschedule it for you?"", she asked. 

I agreed to preschedule the oil change and she found a date 3 months away. 

""Are Sunday's good?""

I said, ""yes, the earlier the better"". 

She said, ""what?"". Her tone was definitely rude. I repeated myself. 

She replied, ""well we open at 7:00 AM"". 

I informed her that 7:00 AM was fine. 

""Is this a good number to call you?"" 

She was looking down at the invoice. I had to search for the number she was referring to. 

I updated my contact information with a pen.

""Is your address correct?"" 

I received my invoice and thanked her. She never responded or even looked at me. 

This experience with Sarah is very alarming, and I am extremely upset. The level of service from the sales team to the service department is usually above satisfactory. It's too bad someone like Sarah could ruin my perception of the dealership's service level in a single interaction. I certainly hope that I won't have to stop referring friends, family, and co-workers to Roseville Toyota. But how can I be sure they won't be subjected to the same experience I just went through?  I feel this was race related, as other white customers were greeted with smiles. 

Please review the video surveillance to observe the unprofessional behavior of Bekah.  In addition, the woman in the adjacent service station was eating food at her computer.  What I experienced is a blemish on the standards of the leadership team. 

At 6:30 PM I called to check the status of my vehicle since I had not heard back from Rebekah. I spoke with Victoria who said the service department was closed. She indicated Rebekah tried calling me at 3:45. I did not receive that call, and Rebekah never followed up before going home. I had to rush over to pick up my car after hours. I was offered a free tank of gas for the inconvenience. This place sucks. ",1.8

404,"December 13, 2018","After 36 years of owning competitor brand vehicles, we finally made the switch to Toyota because of the reliability, reviews and features. We were extremely pleased with Linh Nguyen our sales associate who was straight-forward, personable and honest. As we all know the car buying experience can be  stressful, we appreciated Linh Nguyen's style, which by the way we've never experienced in all our car buying years! We walked away feeling we got the best possible deal and made a friend. Thue Lee from Finance was very friendly and accommodating throughout the process, taking time to explain things to us. 

I have since brought my new car in for service/parts and was equally pleased with Toyota's level of service, from the competitive parts pricing, ease of ordering on line, to Chris in ""Parts"" who assisted me in having my parts delivered to Roseville Toyota saving me $40, to the installation and service representative, Adam K. who was so accommodating and personable. And of course, we are extremely pleased with our new vehicle and excited about making the switch to Toyota. 

I highly recommend Toyota Roseville and if you are searching for a new/used vehicle, go see our new friend, Linh Nguyen. You will feel like you've known him for years and he won't steer you wrong! ",5.0

When I returned to show the large paper document, it was suggested that I should keep that document in my wallet. It was a little off putting. I’m 56 years old. I think I know how to handle my own docs.  Doesn’t fit well in my wallet. Plus I had my expired CDL in wallet. Little thing , but it stuck. The young lady who gave me the walkthrough was thorough.

Immediately they wanted paperwork  with personal information and took our keys to look at our potential trade in car.  Once they had the keys, it was difficult to get them back which was off putting.  The first price offered was way out of what we felt, having done our research, was reasonable.  The car we wanted had extras we didn't prefer and so we were then taken to the ""lot"" to find a car that did have exactly what we did prefer.  There wasn't another car of the model and color (one of 4) we preferred.  We headed back in to the dealership and finally, 4 hours later, with no lunch, were offered a price we felt was at the top but in our acceptable range for the new car and the trade in.  Then we waiting another hour to complete the mountains of paperwork with finance and have the car ready for us.  The last hour was understandable.

799,"October 26, 2018",I was told I needed tires without a description of how bad or that they were dangerous to keep driving on. My windshield wipers were marked as “green” when they are actually broken. Clearly they weren’t checked. My engine air filter wasn’t changed either. When I called to talk to a manager I was told it was Sunday and they were too busy to talk to me.,2.4
800,"October 26, 2018","I’ve always taken my car to Roseville Toyota for service. I was initially very impressed. I thought things were great until approximately a year ago, following one of my service appointments my car wouldn’t start. My husband opened the hood to find extensive amounts of corrosion literally covering my battery. My service record listed my battery in the green range ( meaning no recommended replacement). We called and were treated very well. We were invited to bring it back, and we did. I never fully trusted them again but liked the treatment of the service manager, Shane ( who is always attentive and helpful) so we continued servicing our vehicle there. This time when I picked up my car, I was about to drive off when my husband noticed the good was not closed. I’m so glad he noticed because had I driven off, the hood could have popped up while I was driving. Halfway down the street I realized my tire light was still on. This frustrated me as I assumed my warning lights and any applicable needs would have been addressed during the service. I pulled over and read my service report which listed at least three things that needed attention but were never reviewed with me. My husband called and left a message for Shane and received a call back the next day. He of course apologized and took responsibility for not mentioning one of the items. We were told outlets next service would be free. I may or may not return. A free service sounds great but I don’t want to leave wondering if there was really a service at all. I will say that I don’t hold Shane personally responsible because he doesn’t do the actual work and he’s always been a pleasure to work with. I just don’t think I can trust whoever is performing the maintenance.",3.2

844,"October 22, 2018","I’ve been very happy with the service at Roseville Toyota overall, and for the most part this last experience for the 40,000 mile service. Basically it’s an oil change, tire rotation and the multipoint vehicle inspection. In the past, Roseville Toyota has been really very good about spelling what was really needed, and why, and what could wait. This time was no exception. I had just returned from a cross country trip and was planning a trailer trip the upcoming weekend. Everything checked out okay. So why not 5 stars? Because I no sooner got to our destination when the battery failed. I had to make a last minute appointment at Toyota of Santa Cruz to make sure the electrical system wasn’t an issue, in addition to a new battery. I had 6 years on the original battery, so no complaints there. But I would strongly encourage that for regular interval services that routine check of the battery includes putting a load on it, not simply checking the voltage. Not the service rep at Santa Cruz and the AAA service person who came out the jump start us made identical suggestions. Had a load been put on it, we would had realize it was really on its way out.",4.0

I went and gave the concierge my paperwork. This is where it gets interesting. I waited and waited for my car for over 30 minutes. Another concierge came over and asked if I needed help. Told her I was waiting for my car. She went to check the status and told me it would be a few more minutes. When I got my car back, the first thing I noticed was the air freshener gauge had been turned to the high position (I keep it low) and the smell of vomit. (Not me!). I did notice my car was cleaner than normal. It took rolling down the windows and turning up the vents to get rid of the smell. I was happy with the service, however, if there was a mishap then the service team should have been more honest.

891,"October 16, 2018","We visited Roseville Toyota on Saturday, October 6th, interested in a used honda civic on site. Unfortunately they did not have the exact one but we were ok with this and since we were there, decided to browse. Zachary was our sales associate. He walked us through many vehicles and facilitated test driving for a few too. He was extremely patient with me as I was undecided on the type of car I actually wanted. We finally narrowed it down to 3 camry's. He worked with us getting us all the info we requested and even sat with us through the entire process until we went to the finanace guy. Zachary was extremely knowledgeable about not only Camry's but all cars. He was patient, kind, funny and never pushy..... Toyota should recognize him for his awesome customer service. It was not your typical car buying experience and I was grateful for that, he made it quite enjoyable actually. Keep up the good work Zachary! I'll be sure to refer friends/family your way!",4.8

I was on time for the appointment and Jonathan was waiting for us. We checked the car out and test drove it. Jonathan was pretty knowledgeable about the car, considering it was not a brand they sold at Roseville Toyota. Once we said we would buy it and I made an offer, he did not hand us off to another person to negotiate. He took it to the sales manager, who counter offered, but  Jonathan brought us the numbers. We countered a second time and came to an agreed upon price. Jonathan introduced us to the finance guy. He checked back in to assure the process was moving along. He had the key for us, had the car detailed and waiting for us. The experience was very good, and it was nice to have to just directly deal with 2 of the staff. After the sale and the next day I had a few questions and emailed Jonathan. He immediately emailed back and had the answers I needed. He as well followed up with me on one pending item. Service like this after the sale is generally unheard of in car sales. We had left a house key on the keyFOB of our trade in, and Jonathan mailed it to us. The sale and the service was excellent.

977,"October 07, 2018","I went through Consumer Reports online option so that I could complete as much of my car search and negotiations at arm’s length. Having all the info in writing allows me to think logically, choose exactly what I need, and compare prices, values, and features. I get anxious heebee-geebees having to go up against a salesperson and decide about anything on the spot. When that happens, i always end up feeling that I’ve been bamboozled. 

Mostly the Consumer Reports “True Car” approach worked, with just a few hitches. 

The first big hitch is that when you sign up, you have to provide both a phone number and an email address. There is no way on the signup to indicate one’s preference for contact, or whether there is a problem with any form of contact. (For example, I’m a teacher, and it is absolutely not OK to call me during the school day, which almost all of them did.) So, within three minutes of clicking yes for quotes, my phone started ringing and dozens of emails began pouring in, sometimes from multiple agents at the same dealership. And since Consumer Reports sends the request to three different dealers, the bombardment is from three different dealerships. It’s awful.
But once I reached the callers and told them to STOP CALLING and reach me only by email, the calls slowed down. 
The second hitch is that once my butt was in the chair for the paperwork, they came at me with unexpected offers of all kinds of extended this and that policies, special protective treatments for the paint (I kept remembering the “True Coat” scene in the movie “Fargo,” and felt a mixture of irritation and amusement. Classic car-dealership sleaze moves.) If I had known this crap was coming, I would have refused to sit down with the paperwork guys until this information had been given to me in writing so that I could go home and read it, research it, and make a cool, dispassionate, logical decision. I ended up being talked into a $3,200 service/protection plan (“only $50 a month for five years, and you get eight years of coverage!!!), and ended up angry with them and myself. Went back a few days later to deliver my final check after receiving my outside financing, and told the finance guy how annoyed I was with that add-on. He was a bit defensive at first, but then switched tactics: of course I could decline the add-on, but I’d have to wait to have it refunded by Toyota finance.  WHAT? I didn’t even take Toyota finance! No luck getting him to understand how offensive it was to have them move ahead with Toyota finance when we had an agreement that I was not taking Toyota finance, and had seven days to secure my own. Whatever. I was going to have to wait for refund of the $3,200. Then they guy came at it again; I could get this policy for $1,000 less (“our employee and family discount price”)! He talked me into that. I think — think, not believe totally — that the protection plan is reasonably helpful, given all the sophisticated electronics in my vehicle. But I’m still walking around with deep resentment of the process. 
In the end, I got a good car with the features I wanted, at an OK price, explained well by the internet salesmen with whom I worked. I was treated respectfully, which is important to me as a woman buying on my own. But next time I’ll work hard to head off the last-minute crud at the end, and demand to have all that info in writing before I even poke my head into the office of the bookkeeping/finance guys. ",4.8

1094,"September 23, 2018","I probably went to the dealership on one of the busiest days of the year, which was Labor Day. But, I was there 6 hours buying a car! The salesman was a new employee with less than 2 months experience. He was very polite and professional, but he made a big mistake. He wrote up the wrong car which ended up being $6000 less than the actual car I picked up. So I negotiated and agreed on the price only to find out it was the wrong car.  I realize mistakes happen and the salesman was very apologetic about it, I actually felt bad for him. But, it was the sales manager who made the experience worse. He was arrogant, condescending, and did not accommodate for this mistake. Then my car could not be found on the lot for over an hour. It took hours to go through the process of negotiating twice, finding the car on the lot and waiting for financing since the wrong car was written up. Not acceptable!  I don’t feel I was compensated well on this deal, and my experience was frustrating and less than optimal. That being said, I do love my new RAV4",2.0

My contract was redone 3 separate times due to errors on their part. One of which being them trying to raise my payment and I'm sure they were just hoping I wouldn't notice as I am a young girl who did a lot of this process by myself. Then I was given another form to sign over email but was not told what its purpose was and was not told it was time sensitive. This resulted in money being taken out of my bank account for the car that I had traded in 3 weeks prior, to them. When I called them to get this issue resolved I was belittled, talked over, cut off, and hung up on. When I asked for written confirmation of things pertaining to this form I got no response. I still haven't received a response to this day. Another issue I had with this company is the fact that I was passed around to about 4 different men in finance. Each time something happened I had to deal with a new person which was extremely frustrating because I was met with a lot of ""I dont know"" answers to my questions. I came to roseville toyota because it was highly recommended by family and friends but unfortunately I was not as lucky as them. I will never reccomend this dealership.",1.8

He came back out & told me we took too long to agree on a price & They had sold my blue rav to someone else while we were haggling. He ran & grabbed a grey one for me Instead. I didn't want a grey one! But they did give me the same deal for this one. The low milage & warranty is really what got me to buy this car.

They never let us be alone they hovered next to us the whole time. We couldnt talk to each other privately. It made it feel awkward & uncomfortable & gave it a very unpleasant experience. I wouldn't go back & buy another car there because of this tactic alone.

I am not a car hopper & i do love the rav but i was Told by the salesmen oh you will forget about the color not being blue in a few days.
No i haven't i am very disappointed they sold the blue rav from under me! I really wanted to see that blue car everytime i went out to drive somewhere.

There ensued a a 2+ month ""controversy"" about this problem and requiring me to take this new vehicle to the dealership multiple times and it spending several days in the Service Department undergoing tests, etc.  Roseville Toyota representatives acknowleged the problem in spite of their, and a Toyota corporation engineer, indicating that the vehicle met Toyota specs.  The situation required escalation to the Toyota corporation level.

What followed was a 2+ month back and forth situation until a resolution finally occurred.  During this tense period Senior Service Consultant Kyle Shumacher was always polite, civil, and helpful.  His supervisor, Cole Anderson, was the same.  Their position was difficult; tryng to resolve my complaint, represent Roseville Toyota, and meet Toyota corporate requirements.  

Although this experience was very frustating, I would gladly be served again by Kyle and Cole.  I would rate those two at five stars.  However, my rating of this whole experience results is 4 stars or less.  

During this experience I drove another Toyota RAV4 in the Roseville Toyota inventory and it displayed the same problem as my vehicle. I believe this problem must exist in all similar 2018 RAV4s.  I also believe that the Toyota corporation is sufficiently competent to recognize and resolve this problem prior to the sale of said vehicles.  In total, all of this caused me to lower my rating.",4.0

I walked into one of the offices to get direction of who I needed to talk to to answer my question.  Steve Hancock immediately interrupted my conversation and stated ""Didn't we already take care of that"" (referring to a Lo-Jack I didn't want that was removed from my contract AND I had not even finished my question).  I stated ""Yes we did but I have a question.""

As I followed him, I stated ""I've had the car for two months and I've only been in here twice.""  My thought was, what does it matter, I have questions and you shouldn't have an attitude towards me.  As we were walking, he said ""you didn't get suckered into anything"" referring to a comment I had made about the lojack (I'm sorry but when you say no to lojack at least 6 times and it still ends up on your contract, you tell me what you call it).  I didn't appreciate his comment, since he was't part of the original process so I said ""Bite me!"".  He turned around with an attitude and said ""What did you just say to me?""  I said ""Bite me"".  Then he started ranting and getting upset, so I walked away.  I'm sorry, but as a customer, he started with an attitude.  Instead of ""how can I assist you"", I was greeted with ""dude, what now!""

1122,"September 20, 2018"," I'll first start by saying upon trading in my 2013 Mazda 3 I was given an honest trade in value. That alongside a $5,000 down payment should've been enough to land me a decent enough deal, or so I thought. After agreeing to a fair trade value and fair market price for the newer car my girlfriend alongside myself were then passed along to the finance department. So far yes we were a little weary on such a high monthly payment at $500 a month for a used car but hey I was only at a 602 credit score so i figured hey I'll just refinance in a year. I mean heck i love the car it's worth it to me. However our smiles soon faded as our financial manager proceeded to assure us that if he couldnt find us an interest rate that we didn't approve then hey simply dont purchase the vehicle was his words. You see since we needed to put my girlfriend on the loan and she did not have her license on her at the time we were told to come back in a week at which time we would decide if we actually wanted to purchase the car depending on what the interest rate was. I signed blindly with the reassurance nothing was set in stone except, that when I went back, everything was set in stone and my ignorant xxx went and signed blindly to a 22% interest rate with no ability to return the vehicle dispute being told otherwise. For god's sakes Tommy ( our fiance manger) even went as far as to not record our conversation as it wasn't set in stone it was only preliminary so we could legally drive their vehicle while we were waiting for him to get us a ""great deal"". 16 days later we were unable to get financed and so with my previous cars bank blowing my phone up for payment I finally had to call it quits and get my vehicle back. I'm just glad they didn't sell it in the 2 weeks time because wow would I have really been screwed. This was honestly the opposite of how I saw this transaction happening. I mean you go to these bigger dealers for a reason, so that you dont get screwed...right? I just honestly thank the lord for not allowing us to be financed because shady is all I can say upon reflection of the faulty misleading financial deal I blindly signed. I will say though very stern faced, the sales manager Ray-Rangchi as well as Alejandro angelos Cruz did a good job of really trying for the customer. Outside of that finance treated me like a money figure to hang out to dry to make a quick buck. Only person in your department that helped me truly was melissa the lead finance manager; only took me 2 weeks of bugging about my vehicle to actually reach her desk. This experience has ruined any future car buying or trading for me, at least as far as you bigger dealerships go...should be ashamed of how you did your customer. 100% do not go here!!!! And Laury in finance you should really work on how you hush your discrunteled customers because attacking them for trying to explain the situation simply because we were in ear shot of other potential customers is no way to earn anyone's business. Oh and unfortunately one more comment to help your company out, please make sure your vehicles have gas in them before customers drive off the lot as I had to immediately fill up an empty gas tank after just filling up my Mazda 3 prior to the trade.

1123,"September 20, 2018","All I went in for was an old recall repair. Didn't want anything else touched because i just had the car serviced at my regular shop.

1124,"September 20, 2018","As soon as we sat down inside, our experience went downhill. The sales managers who negotiate your deal are a joke. Why not come out with your best deal out of the gate instead of making a customer spend five hours to get the price to where it could have been from the first 15 minutes? Not only that, but to get the payment lower they removed features and didn’t tell us. Funny how in the initial conversation those were not removable but when it came down to making a sale, they were. Then when we finally got into finance, we gave information on a lower rate and were told we would need to do the footwork and come back within 7 days. Come to find out (after hours of research and footwork) the dealership has a deal with the credit union and should have offered the rate on the spot. Multiple calls back into finance provided no concrete responses. I have yet to receive any paperwork showing who my loan is funded with and if I got the lower rate. When we were called to inquire about our visit, all of this was shared and we were reassured a call back, which weeks later we have still yet to receive.

I have a 2015 Tundra still under warranty with a mere 11,000 miles on it , and recently noticed it has a torn CV boot that's throwing grease. Upon inspection at Roseville Toyota, I was told it would not be covered due to the fact that its lifted, regardless that the lift was done at the same place that Toyota has their lifts done, using the same Pro Comp lift used by Toyota. This truck has never been offroad, and is sitting in the driveway most of the time. The dealer directed me to the shop that installed the lift, who of course directed me back to the dealer as it has nothing to do with the lift. Roseville Toyota knows they should be taking care of this, but has elected not to. This isn't the first Toyota bought from them, but it will certainly be the end of our business together.",1.0

1279,"August 30, 2018","As a long time, multi-Tpyota customer, I am very disappointed with Roseville Toyota Service. The vehicle (2014 Rav4) was brought in for routine maintenance and front brake noise. The service was completed with a new front brake job. As soon as my wife left the parking lot, she noticed a cyclical rubbing sound.  It was late in the day, so she called the following day regarding the sound (which was not present when we dropped the vehicle off).  My wife was told ""the front brake sound is a known issue with Toyota"" and that we basically had to live with it.  I am not a mechanic (that why I used to trust Roseville Toyota to treat us with honesty and integrity) but I knew the rubbing sound just wasn't right.  I called two other area Toyota dealers and spoke to respective service advisors, I described my scenario and they both independently stated there was no such issue.  We took the vehicle back and was initially told there was no rubbing sound.  I reiterated the fact the noise was there. Only after a second test drive and break down of the front brakes did it reveal the front driver's side rotor was not machined correctly causing the noise.  The repair was made at no charge. The problem is; there was no ownership of the faulty initial repair and no apology for the inconvenience of our time and  loss of the use of the vehicle. Very disappointed with Roseville Toyota Service and currently looking at other options for our service needs on the Rav4. Bottom line: Be your own best advocate and make sure the repair is done correctly.   ",2.2

He said truck was washed and ready and that Valet would have it right out to me. After waiting another 20 minutes outside, while watching nearly the entire Toyota staff chit chat and hang out since it was nearing close of business, I finally see my truck driving out the backlot expecting it to be ready.  Low and behold, it took a quick turn and disappeared into the car wash, which they said was already complete.  After another 10 minutes standing there, my truck finally arrived.  2 1/2 hours is not what I would call an “Express Service”.

At 5:45 pm I get a call from my service advisor, my car is ready. The transmission was updated, awesome! The front end noise is coming from your trailer hitch. I asked him how my front end noise is coming from the rear. He explained to me that him and his techs are only human. He also said I have 12 mins now to get my car. Awesome. Let me get to Roseville in Citrus Heights in 12 mins. He was “human” enough to stay for a few extra mins. Thanks. Getting into my truck, I noticed there were fingure prints all over my touch screen stero. The car must of been kept running for no reason because there was big difference of gas levels from when I dropped it off to when I got it back. Or maybe it had something to do with the nearly 30 miles that were driven in my truck. 

So the next day I went to Maita Toyota without an appointment. Explained the problem to the service advisor who was friendly. He put a tech in my car with me immediately to identify the noise. Once the tech heard enough. I went and filled out paperwork with my friendly advisor. He ordered and paid for my Uber ride home. About 2 hours later I get the call. This call was explaining the front end noise. He didn’t say it was a trailer hitch. He didn’t say they were only human. He told me my skid plate was missing a bolt.

1377,"August 21, 2018","From the moment I entered the dealership grounds, attention was given to me. As soon as I stepped out of my (rental) car I was greeted by one of the sales rep and from there my experience was superb. Zach was my first sales rep who helped me out. Afterwards, Cesar Delgado took over. Cesar and I “clicked” right away. Like Zach, Cesar was very attentive to all my questions and requests. He showed me different types of cars that I was intetested in. He was very knowledgeable of the car features and highlighted them to me. It took several hours of looking, traveling back and forth to the “other” place where other cars are parked. It did not happen that first night coz it got late, it was hot outside and I was tired. I know the sales manager (I think that was his title), wanted the deal closed that night, but I had my reservations on the cars I “kind of” liked. The sales coordinator found another car that just arrived. But since it was dark I could not appreciate the car and its features. Honestly, I was not impressed because it was “white” and my previous/wrecked car was white. I told them I would come back the next day. They made me an appointment. 
I had second thoughts of going back because I wanted to see other cars from Infinity or Lexus. But, I felt I owed “something” to Cesar. He worked very hard for me. 
I returned the next day and I fell in love with the Camry hybrid with the “all-around camera” and with a “mint pearl” color (not white). 
My only regrets was I put down too much deposit ($5000). It was my first lease. When I was dealing with the monthly payment, I forgot that it was a lease and I agreed with the amount of deposit the sales manager suggested. Oh well, you win and then you lose....
I also would like to give a shout-out to...sorry, I forgot her name. She was very patient with all my questions re:features and functionality of the car.

Courtney was wonderful to work with - responsive, caring, etc. However, I was very disappointed in the cost of a part I needed, which was quoted to me at more than double the cost of which it was listed on YOUR OWN website.

Additionally, the reason this part was needed in the first place is because YOUR team tightened the cap way beyond specification so when we attempted to change our own oil, the cap was not removable. When my son attempted to remove with the approriate tool, the part cracked. Courtney kindly gave us a 10% discount and said she'd mention to the team. NO RESPONSE to our concern was mentioned.

Chad the Sales Mgr I guess was his title since no one gave me their business cards, promised to add items in the sale of my truck after I asked them to take it off in the first place.  I then went to Finance and and Richard didn’t go over any prices with me except for the extended warranties and packages that they supply.  He didn’t say this is the price of your truck with the items that I added on (leather).  When I got home after being at the dealership for over 5 hours I went over my contract and saw that they did in fact  add items (LoJack, Tracker and Dent Pro) to my contract and the sale price of my vehicle was almost $4K more than we discussed.  I then called Chad to get clarification on everything and he explained it again to us but my husband and I were misinformed and raised our voices.  We never yelled at them but trying to understand and get our point across.  Chad said he would take off the items they added ok but he didn’t.  We had to go through the finance to get them removed and credited back to us through Toyota Financial.  This transaction I was told takes 3-4 weeks to show up meanwhile they cashed my check the same day as the purchase of the truck.  I also wanted to know the payoff amount of the truck nownsincr this will lower the overall amount of the vehicle being financed but still have not received anything.  Also did I mention that we never received calls back after we left messages each day.  Took someone 3 days to return our call.  I’m not satisfied with this dealership and I will NOT be buying anymore cars from them in the future and will ALWAYS return back to Concord Toyota where I’m treated like family there.

He didn't try to talk me into or out of anything, and let the test drive do the talking.  I would shop with miles any day of the week, just not for Toyota.
Yes we bought a RAV4, but only because Miles was such a standup guy.  Then we had to deal with Howard.  His only concern was selling the car.  We explained we wanted to wait to refinance our home, and he kept pushing.  On top of that he quoted a price with extras I told him  i didn't want, which included LoJack.  Every time he came back with a ""deal"" I said I didn't want Lojack and the other options he was peddling.  We finally agreed on a monthly payment and an interest rate I was happy with.  Then when we got in with Joe, come to find out Joe kept stating ""That's the price and options you agreed to.""  I walked out the FIRST time to go get Howard to explain what he had told Joe I agreed to, and then straightened them out.
At which time Joe started peddling extras.  I told him I was in his office to sign a sales agreement and that it wasn't his place to continue to sell me option.  He kept pushing, I walked out again, very upset.
I left for some time, but considering the actual price of the car was good, ad our current vehicle had 300,000+ miles on it, we needed a reliable car.  We finally agreed on the paperwork, and I tried to read everything while I signed.  But when I got home I noticed a discrepancy and returned the next day.  I spoke with Rejent, who had to make corrections to my contract because what?  They hadd added the LoJack anyway.

I immediately brought the vehicle back and had a nice long talk with the manager about the last service. third time it was fixed but honestly I can still feel something is off on the steering I would not recommend this model to anybody and after doing research I found out 2017 models have the same ongoing issue.

1467,"August 09, 2018",I would like to thank my sales man James Godinez first off for the no pressure on looking at cars after a long struggle and with the help of sales manager Steve H. I was able to get a brand new 2018 Corolla! I appreciate you for looking out for me and my family! I definitely will recommend you to my friends and family and looking forward to my Camry in a few years!,5.0
1468,"August 08, 2018","I bought bought a brand new 2018 Toyota Corolla yesterday and the car is great. Let me start off by saying that James Godinez was awesome and very helpful  as well as Mr. Hancock who helped us get the deal we wanted. When We first arrived to the dealers were hoping not to be followed around by a salesman while we shop but that’s exactly what happened. A guy who’s name started with a T (Tran maybe?) greeted us and asked if we needed help, what were lookin for, color etc. I told him what I wanted but I also told him specifically that I would like to walk around alone with my dad and shop in private but that I appreciate his help. He said Ok cool if I need any help to ask for him. We thought that issue was fixed. No less than 30 sec later he walks back with james and says “this is james he’s new he’s great etc he will be helping you out now”. At this point were like xxx? I just told You we wanted to walk alone and you bring someone else instead? Idk what his mindset was, did he think we didn’t like him? Did he think since my dad looked hispanic we needed a hispanic salesman? I didn’t understand why he did that after politely asking him we wanted to be alone. At that point I wanted to leave but we had drivn pretty far to get there so we stayed. Walking around irritated I finally explained to james what had happened and he apologized and said he didn’t know that was the case and that was just trying to help us. I believe him since we relized he was the new guy and his co-worker maybe threw him at us on purpose to mess with him? Moreover, James showed us around the lot and took us to their bigger lot trying to help us find what we wanted and we did. We went inside made the deal with Mr. Hancock and that was that. They moved us with the finance guy who I also can’t remember his name but he was terrible. We almost walked out of his office and called the whole dea off. He came off like an office shark from the jump. He started offering us all kinds of maintenance add ons and gap. This was expected, thats his job. I declined everything but still asked him to explain what GAP was. (I know what it is because I used to sell it a credit union when I worked there I was seeing if Toyotas was any different) he explains what it is and again I still decline. The guy gets upset, keeps mentioning how im driving for uber and LyFt etc. What I do with my car is none of his business But since I mentioned it he was using it as a selling point. Finally, he moves forward with the paperwork but before he does while looking at his screen he says “YOU DON’T KNOW WHAT GAP IS.” To which I responded “I do know what gap is and he stayed quiet. It was at that point that we wanted to say screw this. I took that as insult to my intelligence. He had just finished explaining it to me and like I said im familiar with the product. Is he saying I’m in capable of comprehending what he just explained to me? It was the way he said it. He kept trying to offer it later even lowering the price. I declined. To the very last second he kept offering the maintenance deals but like I said I didn’t want them and most of all I didn’t want to business with this guy at all.  After we wallked out I’m expecting to get my car but it was still being cleaned. Fine. While were waiting, James get sent over by the finance guy to collect our proof of income. Like really? After we signed everything? Why didn’t he ask for it in his office? Whatever, James took us over to a computer and we printed out a bunch of statements for him. On side note, the finance guy seemed very condescending when talking to James im front of us, probably since he’s the new guy, from when we first met in the lobby I could tell he was just all fake smiles with the customers and a jerk to his lower ranking co-worker. Moreover, this whole process took about 5 hours.... 2-3 weeks after my purchase I was still getting phone calls of income verification because there weren’t any deposits from my new employer even though I have a co-signer. We both gave them our bank statements. Steve wanted me to give him a more recent one until I texted him Asking what the process would be to return my car.( I was just done with all this). To which I get an immediate phone call saying he no longer needs anything and that were all good. Interesting to say the least. ",3.4

1505,"August 04, 2018","Started out as a complete nightmare. I was specific with my needs. Finance did their own thing and lost financing. Ended up with higher financing but a new 2018 Toyota Yaris Ai. My sales person Jennifer Buckley did an amazing job. She understood my requests and demands. Unfortunately it was financing (Regent) that did not hold up to his deal. The Nissan Versa Kelly Blue Book was only worth $10,000.00. Sold the vehicle for 12,499 and requested 14,000.00 from the bank. I informed Jennifer and the sales Manager if the negative equity of $4,300.00 was not included then there is no deal with Golden 1. I feel I was perfectly honest with my request and Roseville Toyota broke my trust. Ryan Ross put in a new loan offer through Golden 1 which was in pre approved status only not approved like I was with the previous loan. Unfortunately, I was never able to get approved through Golden 1 and ended up with Travis Credit Union. The only good end result was I was able to get the loan in my father's name only, keep the payments the same and include some extras for the vehicle.  Example: Window tinting and seat protectant.  I just feel that the extra week of frustration was preventable when I was clear of my request which was $20,000.00 pre approved credit,  absorb negative equity of vehicle and $500.00 down payment.  Any car that would fall under those requirements.  My dad drove an unfinanced vehicle for a week. I am happy with the end result, unhappy that I took all the correct steps and still had to do it the Finance Manager way. Very frustrating experience but at least my dad got a new car at the end of the day. My biggest complaint Finance Manager's need to listen to the customer!",3.8

Kind of strange security wise too, at least for me coming from a financial institution.  Lori, who did our paperwork, was absolutely delightful. We were very tired and hungry as I had worked all day and we weren’t expecting to buy a car that night, so while we enjoyed the conversation and hospitality, I would have preferred if there was just a bit less of that and more hustle on our paperwork.

Called to service desk and told oil pan plug was stripped and wherever I took it last did it and it would cost over $500 to fix it.

My mechanic said have my car towed to my house and he would service car.  Dealership was offering free tire rotation with service and was charging me for that service because the servicing was not done. I had to get quite angry for charge to get waived.
When I got my car home, the mechanic said my car no longer had hybrid oil in my car- it was old used oil. Replacement of damage done by Toseville Toyota for parts was $200 .",1.0

We met Skye, our salesman at Roseville, shortly after parking.  After finding out our needs, he RAN in the heat to fetch a truck and cool it down for our test drive.  Upon return he demonstrated all the major features and answered more questions on the drive.  

He worked to find a truck that met our requirements.  While certainly asked for our business there was no real  pressure to buy immediately,  

We ultimately made an offer and after a long negotiation with his managers over two days we reached a deal.  Despite the long negotiation, everyone was polite, friendly and respectful that we dealt with.

Customer rep, Natasha, was not my assigned rep but I was unlucky....  She argued with me about my issue which had not been intermittent prior to arriving but for some reason my car decided to be difficult and  behave well for her during drop off.  So she was going to me home without service - which I understood but as soon as I went to leave I was able to repeat the issue so I went back to let her know.  She said came back out to see it and reluctantly agreed to keep the car.  Although she took the vehicle in for service but after 6 hours I had not received any updates.  Had to call 2x over 2.5 hours - Natasha did not return my first call and they could not get her with a page either time -before finally getting in touch with Derek who was able to check in and advise the status of my vehicle. Apparently the morning exercise with Natasha had been a waste of time as the techs in the back still had to duplicate the problem before it could be fixed...leaving me to wonde why I wasted 40 minutes with Natasha while dropping off my vehicle. While doing close out paperwork with Derek when picking up my car, Natasha came by and interrupted us to tell him she was leaving for the day since “it was after 6”.  I hope she was just having an off day and is not always as unprofessional with customers as she was during my interactions with her.   To top it off,  I had been asked while dropping off my car whether I wanted a free car wash - i had said yes and it was clearly noted on my paperwork.  When I picked up the vehicle I was again asked if I wanted a wash and then was told it would be at least 15 minutes to get my car if I wanted a wash. No. Thank. You.   Glad they didn’t wash it and leave it in the sun to get spots but...

It’s not like I got a great deal because Roseville Toyota is only $50 less than of what other dealers are offering.

I talked with Mike Jaquez on my first trip to the dealership and he was really helpful and patient. He took time to answer my questions (and find out the answers for the questions wasn't sure about which I liked). He wasn't pushy at all... Huge bonus. I kept in touch with him and he was always willing to help. After about a week, I went back and worked with him on buying the truck I wanted.

Since then, he's followed up with me to see how everything is going. Definitely a pleasant surprise.

The process much easier than I was expecting and I would definitely go back to Roseville Toyota and Mike if I needed anything.

1794,"July 02, 2018","I purchased a platinum tire warranty when i bought my Tacoma here. It is nationally advertised as a replacement only tire warranty, no repairs. It is also a very expensive add-on.

I brought my truck in for service because one tire wasn?t holding air and had a visible screw in it. When i arrived and was taken to Paul Koontz, he immediately tried to talk me into a tire repair. He said he had never heard of a warranty that offered replacement.
Why on earth would I pay $600 for a tire warranty that covers $10 repairs that can be purchased at any tire shop? How has your service advisor never heard of your tire warranty?

Further, he told me a warranty replacement would take 4 hours because I did not have an appointment. A repair could be done right away.

Common sense tells me that the main tasks involved in repair and replacement are the same. 1) you take off a tire. 2) you put on a tire.

I insisted on replacement and asked that he look up my warranty. The replacement ended up taking 2 hours.
Was this a punishment for insisting on  the service that I had pre-paid for?
Paul had said repair could be done right away.

I do not appreciate being lied to!

If your shop is too busy that day, tell me. I know I am there without an appointment. Don?t lie!

If a service member can repair right away, he can replace right away. Don?t lie!

If tire replacements are too expensive, stop selling the warranty. Don?t lie!

If by some small chance your service advisors dont have training on vehicle warranties, train them. If they dont know a product, get help from an advisor that does. If all else fails, the finance manager that sells the warranties is just a few offices away.",1.0

1917,"June 19, 2018","I am highly disappoint with Roseville Toyota, first while in the purchasing process of my 2015 Prius, another individual “reserved” the car I was signing the paperwork to buy, resulting in a search for the car, followed by the search for single key to the vehicle which the internet salesmen had brought home to ensure the car remained until the next day. After the key was retrieved, my new-to-me Prius was finally brought in be washed, the whole ordeal last five hours, ending with the salesman (Klaus Labuttis) unable to fill the vehicle up at the dealerships gas station and having to retrieve another dealership credit car, another half hour of my time washed. I didn’t leave the dealership until 9:50 PM. 

The following day while showing my wife the car I had just purchased, she noticed a large metal box in the glove box, I called Klaus at Roseville Toyota and left a message explaining to him that I had what I believed to be a lock-box belonging to the dealership as well as expressing concern that I hadn’t received a spare key to my vehicle and I would be interested in acquiring one. 

A day passed with no returned phone call from Klaus Labuttis, so I tried him again, he explained to me that the vehicle was used and only came with one key. He quickly changed the subject and directed questions towards my spare key for the vehicle I had traded in for my new Prius, to which I replied that I would be willing to come back in to return my old spare key, and the lockbox in return for a spare key as a sign of good will. He said that my truck I had traded in would sell regardless of the spare key being turned in and that he had no authority to give me a spare key for my new vehicle. He explained to me that “if I was of good character” I would just give them the spare key and “that was all he had to say about that” the phone call was ended with no resolution. 

Approx. one hour later I received a phone called from Klaus Labuttis expressing that he felt badly and that if I had time the following day 6/19 that I could bring my old spare key in, with the lock-box and he would “take care of me” and get me a new spare for my Prius. 

Today, I visited the dealership at the set time 3:45 PM for our agreed upon time of 4:00 PM, the receptionist at the desk said she would page Klaus and after 3 failed attempts a sales manager came out. I explained to the manager (I believe his name was Collin) about the arrangement Klaus and I had discussed the day prior and he informed me he “had no idea” what Klaus and I talked about and “that was between me and Klaus” he took the key for my old Tundra from me and the lock-box and told me to have a seat. 

At 4:20 when Klaus finally showed up, he let me know that there was a misunderstanding and that he never had the pull to get me that spare key. He let me know that he had never said anything about my spare key for my Prius and that If I would like he could take to his sales manager about getting one on a discount. After explaining to the sales manager the two separate conversations Klaus and I had the day prior Klaus proceeded to raise his voice and demanded I not “put him in this position” the sales manager told Klaus “everything was just fine” and Klaus exited the room. The Sales manager let me know that he was sorry about Klaus’s behavior but there was nothing he could do to get me a key. 

All in total I wasted an absolutely rediculious amount of time at this dealership dealing with issues that I’ve never dealt with before while purchasing my other two Toyota vehicles. 

Roseville Toyota is the reason why there is a negative connotation associated with car buying especially when it comes to dealership. Their professionalism and customer service is severely lacking and I will be taking my business elsewhere. I’m still a huge fan of Toyota’s and this amazing value but this experience has put a sour taste in my mouth. I hope me sharing this experience will help other buyers in the future. ",1.6

I heard a grinding noise from my front left rotor.  Immediately took it to Toyota to replace my brake fluid and check on the noise.  They stated back brakes and rotors are good.  They stated a bolt was grinding on both front rotors.  They suggesting replacing both front rotors, brake pads and hardware for $1,200.  I picked up the car as is and drove it home.  I bought new caliper bracket bolts (dealership stated these were the bolts grinding on rotors) from auto parts store for about $6.  Took apart front brakes and rotors to find it was grinding on front left only, not both front rotors.  Once I replaced the caliper bracket bolts with new ones the grinding and noise went away.  Not sure why the original bolts were longer on the front left.  Fixed the issue for $6 and about 30 minutes of my time.  Dealership wanted $1,200.

1955,"June 14, 2018","When I initially spoke with Sally at the service center she was helpful in going over everything. But then I needed to change the date of my window tinting and it was ridiculously hard to get a hold of her since she is apparently the only one who could help me. After finally getting a hold of her I was able to change the date. When I had initially spoken with her she had advised that the window tint would only take about an hour and a rental car would be provided if I needed one. I clarified with her twice that the service would only take an hour, which seemed short considering I was offered a rental for the whole day, but that’s what she told me so I believed her. Fast forward to Friday, the day I took so much time to reschedule for, and I drove out from Sacramento at 7am in traffic to make it on time for my appointment. I asked the very nice girl at the service desk to confirm that it would only take an hour and she said no the car would be ready by 3. I had plans to be in Reno by three so she rushed to get my car back before they sent it out. I am annoyed and frustrated by the whole thing because now I have to take extra time to reschedule another appointment, which took forever to make in the first place, and make an extra trip out to Roseville for which I will have to take time off work, again, to make.

1982,"June 11, 2018","DON'T DO BUSINESS WITH TOYOTA AT THE ROSEVILLE, CA AUTOMALL. 
When I knew what car I wanted, it took me over 4 hours to negotiate the pricing I wanted for my trade in and purchase of the new car. This is way too long and nobody has time for this! They kept me sitting in the lobby for several hours while they went back and forth with their managers on the pricing and taking their time. In the meantime, I called a few other dealerships and they told me over the phone they would offer me the pricing I wanted which told me that it was easily doable. I am a loyal person though and decided to stick it out with them (although i wish I didn't). The sales rep that helped me was great but the management was VERY dishonest and lied to me several times to get me to not walk out. They offered me a price as I was walking out and then back and then retracted it several times. I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THIS DEALERSHIP TO ANYBODY. POOR MANAGEMENT!
On a side note, while I was getting my first service, I started to look at vans for my wife because she wanted Toyota. Once again, it took me SEVERAL hours to get to the pricing we wanted and at that time, I was so mad that I left. I continued to text the sales guy (who was great to work with) and he said that his management was ok with the pricing and to come back. Well, we went across the street to Honda and told them what we wanted and they offered us A BETTER VAN for CHEAPER! We went with the Honda. 
I WILL NEVER WORK WITH THIS DEALERSHIP AGAIN and would recommend HONDA ACROSS THE STREET (ROSEVILLE, CA AUTOMALL)",2.0
1983,"June 11, 2018","When I showed up it seemed like there was some confusion and priority distinction. The persons that were checking people in didn’t seem very happy to be there and their directions to me were short and confusing. I was led in and dropped off at an empty service manager desk and with nothing said, just left there. When the service manager showed up, I heard a barrage of excuses including that management just sprung new software/procedure and everything was down. The amount of time it took to complete my first service was acceptable however when I picked up the truck it wasn’t cleaned, considering I said yes multiple times to the car wash it seemed like someone just sprayed my new truck down with a hose. It was not, to say the least what I expected after just financing $37,000 with Toyota. I didn’t expect a detail on my vehicle but there were bugs still everywhere on the front of the truck and my interior driver side floor had water all over it. I think had I not felt rushed to move my truck I would have made a bigger deal out of it. I realize Toyota is a very busy place but I left feeling like a number and not a valued customer. I financed all of my services so it felt like the extra touch meant nothing. ",2.4

Klaus showed me the new Corollas, then Jonathan helped me further. I was told by someone else with him that I could only get my car inspected for the return if I picked out a car to run the numbers against. I wasn’t too keen on that idea, as I knew it was a marketing ploy, but I didn’t mind too much. Anyways, I ended up picking a silver 2018 Corolla SE. I ended up deciding to lease it and to return my ‘15. Jonathan was very friendly while he waited with me for forms to be run. Steve took care of the financial stuff and form signings.

Service members always have a hard time finding my information every  time I call to schedule my appointment and when I show up because my last name is misspelled in the system and has never been changed to solve this problem for future appointments. The service rep gave me a timeframe of 1 hour to 1.5 hours. At approximately 11:45 I started to walk around the retail area waiting for my name to be called or my phone to ring and while doing so I Walked by the service rep who was chatting with another employee. 12:30 arrived and I’m still waiting for an announcement that my car is ready. I take the initiative to walk over to the office of the rep and she walks past me as I’m walking into the office. A few minutes later she shows up and asks if I received her text message that she sent at 11:30. I didn’t receive a text or any other form of contact that my car was ready. I’m not sure why I would receive a text message for my service completion when I have always been contacted by phone call or intercom announcement in the past. I’m also not sure why an hour had gone by and there was no contact from the rep who had walked past me several times during that hour time frame. There were no text messages sent to my phone by the computer the rep used and she admitted that this has happened before so why would she not use another form of contact to let me know of the service completion? I’m still debating on whether or not to return to this location now that my service contact is up and I have other choices.,1.6

2208,"May 16, 2018","I would rather drive an extra 30 minutes to go to any other Toyota dealership. If I could sell my car and break somewhat even it would be gone immediately. The service at this dealership has made me callous and removed all possibilities of ever buying a Toyota again. They should seriously fire every person they have in service, especially the ones that deal with customer service, or at the very least heavily retrain them. Every time they take over an hour to do an oil change or other minor maintenance and then the service writers that are supposed to call you up, are too busy playing games on their phones or texting their friends to care about their jobs. And this was the same kind of “service” we received in numerous visits. I once watched my car get parked and sat and waited to be contacted for it for another 30 minutes before I walked up to the girl, texting on her phone (not on a lunch break either), and asked her if my car was ready to which she replied it will be done when I call you up. 10 minutes later she called me up and said “it just finished”. I wish that I had names of these people so they could be dealt with, but honestly it’s not just one time, one trip, it’s every time and they’ve all been horrible except one nice young man that works in sales. I can not express enough that the service department is terrible, and will never get a recommendation from me. If I could give them 0 stars, I wouldn’t hesitate. This is forcing me to pick an employee, however they are not the ones responsible for this atrocious service but rather the survey won’t let me complete it without selecting it.

She calls back when she says she will unlike others...My brand new 2018 truck went in to have heated seats installed, a two day process and a five hour round trip for us to take the truck in.  We got a call at the end of the second day that the truck was done and ready for pickup then a few minutes later a second caller left a message that that my truck had been hit in their parking lot by one of their employees.  A truck with 850 miles on it now had been in an accident.  Needless to say I was very, very unhappy.  Numerous phone calls to the dealership to find out what had happened and what they planned to do about it went unanswered.  Call after call, I left messages asking for a call back.  Finally someone got back to me and sent a picture and said that they were sending my truck to a body shop for repair and it would take about a week.  I waited a week and hadn't heard if my truck was repaired so I called and played phone tag again.  The gentleman in the vehicle loner dept. by the way was great and gave me a name to ask for. 
I had taken my truck in on May 1st and they brought it back to me on May 12th, the damage appears to have been fixed.  I understand that accidents happens but the very least a customer should expect are return phone calls in a timely manner.

I was dead set on buying a Subaru Legacy at the Subaru dealership, but due to the fact that the Subaru Dealership was not prepared for me (though I made an appointment with them), my family and I went to the next dealership we saw just to browse around while the Subaru sales representative went to get my car from another lot. The Toyota Sales Representative Roman Lupu met us right away to see if we need any help looking around. Though I was very against looking for any Toyotas, I told Roman enough information for him to get a clear enough picture of what I am looking for in a car. The second car Roman showed me was what I definitely considered buying. I really started to like this car when Roman and I went on a test drive. Roman's knowledge of the car AND of the competition really impressed me! Because of him, I was able to trust the dealership that they were selling me the safest car, the 2018 Toyota Camry SE. Roman helped me get the car with the right color and all the seemingly minor details I really wanted. The specific type of Camry that I wanted was not on the lot and had to be made. Roman was very apologetic that He didn't have the car on hand, but that was understandable, and I only had to wait 5 days until my car arrived on their lot. Roman answered all my questions accurately, and when the time came to buy my Camry, he was honest and open about the price, and more importantly, we were able to come to a final price where both of us were pleased. After all the paperwork was completed and the car was bought, Roman's co-worker Marina was really helpful in explaining to me how everything works in my Camry. Overall, I had a satisfying experience and if you are going car shopping in the Roseville Auto Nation, I would highly recommend you go to the Toyota dealership and ask for Roman Lupu, you can trust that he WILL take care of you.",5.0

Sales 3 star. Worked with Klaus. 

Sales manager 3 star. Worked with Howard Sweeney 

Both Klaus and Howard are high pressure sales using manipulation tactics and do not listen to customer concerns vrs their sales objectives. 

Assan with Finance provided inaccurate information regarding LoJack costing me to discontinue LoJack service and a financial loss. The customer service rep (Jessica) was exceptional in attempting to resolve the matter. The finance person (Pete?) was exceptional at trying to resolve the matter. In the end LoJack would cost me $300 to install and transfer previous paid service from my 2017 plan. I decided not to pursue the LoJack install and cut my loss on my 2018 purchase. 

On a positive note John L Sullivan’s dealership is a 5 star and I would recommend others and return myself for a vehicle purchase and service. I would caution all to be aware of the sales tactics. In the end it Is their goal to sell vehicles and make money. In order to be completely satisfied I would appreciate the sales folks to listen to the customers to assure a long term repeat business and word of mouth recommendations. ",3.4

Also you should know the truck only had 27,000 miles on it as well.  The Freon had apparently leaked out of the air conditioning unit.  And I was informed that the Freon was not covered under the warranty.  Now I’ve owned vehicles for many years and never had to have the Freon recharge after 27,000 miles.   The dealership charged me for the Freon. And told me that they could not find anything wrong with my voice recognition on my stereo.    I paid the bill and went on my way.  Two months later the air-conditioner failed again and the  voice recognition is no longer working again.    I brought the truck back to the dealership for the air-conditioner and voice recognition. And they said that they found a bad seal in the air conditioner which they warranted. And told me that they updated the firmware in my stereo so the voice recognition would work now.  The air-conditioner is now working. But the voice recognition failed again three hours later.  The thing that really bothers me is that they charge me for the Freon the first time and did not refund my money after they found the problem was indeed a factory defect. I think they should’ve refunded my dollars that I paid for the Freon the first time. And now I have to take my truck back in again to get the voice recognition fixed. again! ",2.6

2574,"April 11, 2018","I was scheduled to have a 15k mile service.  My customer service representative was at lunch when I arrived and I was directed to work with the manager to get me signed in.  The manager seemed put-off when I was brought to him.  I am not sure about his name as he did not offer it or a card.  He did not ask me why I was there or if there was anything else that he could help me with so I had to bring it up.  I told him that the rear power sliding window of my truck was leaking when I went through a car wash.  He told me that I must have had the window open.  I told him no, because I checked while I was in the car wash.  He told me that it must have been a high pressure car wash.  I told him that it was a normal gas station carwash and that the water seemed to be coming from the molding on top of the window as the glass is inside a top and bottom rail and the water could not go up and over the glass.  He stopped talking to me and just wrote up my 15k mile service request and told me that they will call when it was ready.  Nothing was checked and no notes were made on my request.  A few days later, it rained overnight and my back seats were drenched.

I also checked online prices of above vehicles, packages they came with and blue book values of the above highlanders and Toyota Rav 4 before I arrived. I phoned in and made a appointment with internet sales person Roman and stated I wanted to compare the Rav 4 and Highlander and their different packages. I met with Roman at 10:00 in the morning and spent 2 1/2 hours looking at and comparing above vehicles and taking small test rides to determine what we wanted. 
My wife and I decided  on a 2016 XLE highlander do to a excellent repair history for that year, the extras we wanted, and the price compared to a new one. With some haggling we arrived at a good price for the vehicle compared to internet info. 
The main reason we purchased the certified used vehicle that day was do to the professionalism, knowledge of vehicles including mechanical, the time taken to get us a vehicle we wanted, easy going demeanor, and reasonable amount of time it took to get a good price from the salesperson Roman. 
I would give the salesperson Roman five Stars and the dealership 4 1/2 stars with the dealership only lacking in snack food, they had water, coffee and tea, since we ran through lunch. The final financial paperwork also took a little bit longer than expected. I was not allowed to put a 1/2 star or it wood rate 4 1/2 stars overall.

So I say ok then they come back and say they can only get me into a basic Hyundai and it’d be like $400+ a month. I tell him I’m not interested but he’s super persistent trying to sell me on this car I’m not going to be ok with. Especially for that amount. This is when I meet Barry from the financial department. We talk and I tell him I won’t buy that car and to make a list of cars he can finance. So he does and I tell him the car I would be willing to get. So I go home and wait for his call to see if he’d be able to do it. He calls me a day or two later and says he can and I just need to come in and finish up paperwork. I ask him how long is it going to take and he says “we’ll get you in and out in about a hour or 2 max, you just need to test drive and choose, and do paperwork”. I say “are you sure cuz I need to be at work(at a certain time and tell him the time) and I can’t be late,you going to have the cars ready right? ” , he says “ yeah I’ll have you in and out don’t worry”. So I go in and bring my kids mother so she can drive my car back to my place or the new car back to my place. We get there and they don’t have anything ready at all. We are forced to search for the two cars I said ok to for 2 and a half hours. Driving around all the lots. And they still can’t find either of the cars!! After more than two hours I tell him “look I have to go to work and you should have had this ready like you said, so let’s just go back so I can leave”, Junior says let me try this last area. We go to the last area and he finds the year and model I’m looking for but it’s not the one they said, so junior calls Barry to see if they can do this one instead. Barry says yes, so we go back.Then we get back and all the paperwork I already filled out was lost so I had to do it again, then they ask for extra info that made no sense in them needing. At this point I’m getting irritated, cuz this is lack of professionalism, and being prepared. Then my kids mother speaks up on something she finds funny and not needed, and Junior gets a attitude with her and just basically tried to blow her off. She’s pissed so she walks out. I have to check him and make sure he understands that he doesn’t get a attitude and talk to her in this manner. Now I’m pissed and irritated and I tell him get Barry I’ll deal with him. Barry gives a half xxx apology and moves on to the sale. At this point I really have to go so I’m rushing. Sign paperwork and run out of there to get to work. My kids mom was forced to wait for them to detail the car for a hour and then she leaves. At this point I might have gave them 3 stars but that’s not the end of my story. About a week later I get a call after 12 hour shift from Barry saying that they need to cancel sale cuz the bank, but if I give them a extra $500 on top of the $2400 we can continue the sale. At this point I lose it and tell him he better figure something out cuz I’m not doing that. He calls back and says if I give him $300 more he could drop apr a point and lower payments about $80 a month. So I say fine and I go there and pay. Then a week after that they call and say they need even more info and paperwork. At this point I’m just really pissed, speak to there manager Franklin. Franklin apologizes and says that I’d deal with him from now on. I send Franklin info requested. 3 days later Junior calls again asking for info I just sent Franklin. I tell Junior to get info from Franklin and stop calling me cuz I’m feeling harassed and at this point this should have been done, so if they need to contact me tell Franklin to contact me. 3 days later I get a letter from them stating another cancellation of sale!!! And I’m like xxx???!!!! So I call Franklin and he’s like idk what this is about. He calls back and asks for a bank statement and this would be done and apologizes again. So I send him info and now almost a month later is finally looking like it’s done. The only reason I gave them one star would be cuz of Franklin. But this process has been nothing but headaches and stress. I would not advise anyone to deal with these people but if you do deal with Franklin. ",1.2

In for Dallas, I won’t return because of the finance experience. I purchased two vehicles in 3yrs from this location. My sales experience both times was excellent. The finance team the first time was great, BUT this time was extremely poor. I explained I was going on vacation the time of purchase to the finance person, he missed a document, on 3/20 he called and harassed me after I explained to I would not be available to sign until I returned on 3/24, even said h would be driving to my house to personally drop
off the document after questioning my whereabouts seveal times. I had no reason to lie, we had planned this family vacation and spent well over 5k on this vacation. I did not plan for my daughters car to break down. I did plan to receive the same email experience I recieved the first time I purchased from here less than 3 years ago. After explaining that I had no
Option as I was on vacation and contacting Dallas our awesome sales person, he said he would see to it that the letter was mailed not driven to my home, as that creeped me out as I had a young lady housesitting for me and to have a stranger drive unwelcomed to my house...not good. As promised I returned on 3/24 only to find a letter in the mail from the finance director asking to return the vehicle with no reason why other than not able to get ahold of me. Which is not true since I was coordinating with Dallas via email when at ports I had access while
On the cruise and I had already made arrangements to finish the missed document when I RETURNED! So this survey is timely... I am filling out just a few moments after coming home to that letter.

I did though and now, after my car buying experience over the weekend, I'm SO glad that I did. The only thing I can think of was that the people writing these reviews must not have been working with Barry Lyman. Barry was the first to respond to my internet application and I hit the jackpot with him. Seriously. He's amazing. I went in with the intention of looking at some used compact SUVs. I walked out with a 2018 Toyota RAV4. I didn't think that a new car was even an option for me. I've been working so hard to rebuild my credit over the last few years but it's still not amazing. Barry worked tirelessly to find me a payment plan that I felt comfortable with in my dream vehicle. He even ran all over the lot to locate one in purple after I mentioned it was my favorite color. (I didn't even know they came in purple!) The fantastic thing about working with Barry is that you don't have to do your usual dealership thing about being bounced around from person to person. He is with you for 95% of the process. The only time he leaves is when you go to sign the paperwork to finalize things. I should note that the guy in financing, David Dryden, and his associate whose name I can't currently recall, were also wonderful and put me at ease. As was the lady who helped show me how to do things on the new car after. I was driving a 2001 Saturn before so, suffice to say, technology and cars have advanced a lot since then.

Having said that, my experience was that it took too long to go through the sales cycle at this dealership; it made me long for the Carmax model.  When you begin by test driving the cars/models you are interested in, it takes a long time for the sales personnel to locate the car that fits your requirements.  Then when you have decided on a model, it takes even longer for the sales person to locate their ""best fit.""  It appears that the problem is that they do not have a computerized inventory that could be used to locate cars faster for their customers and this wastes a lot of time.  

On the actual ""sales"" side, I was not impressed when it turned out to be the old used car sales gimmick of ""I'll have to talk to my manager and get back to you"" routine.  Well, my wait between each cycle (when we were negotiating the price/terms) was at least an hour.  In my case, I had 3 or 4 cycles; it was so excruciating I can't remember.

The bottom line is that it took me more than 8 hours to finalize this transaction (in my case, a lease) and I was exhausted when it finally came time to sign all the paperwork.  And the paperwork is very confusing and hard to understand.  In my case, we finally negotiated a monthly price for the lease but there is no way to easily correlate the final price with the resulting paperwork and the sales manager is nowhere to be found when you are signing.  And by the time I was signing the paperwork I was mostly ""brain dead"" anyhow. 

When I do this next time, at another dealership, I will give myself a time frame and walk away if I am not finished by then.  I admire this dealership for having such friendly people and a beautiful facility but I will choose some other dealership that I feel can expedite and close much faster than I experienced at Roseville Toyota.  Also I would caution anyone who is contemplating a lease, watch out for all the ""insurance"" items they want to tack on (such as tire/wheel, dent fixing, GAP, etc.).  Check with your car insurance carrier and you will likely already have some coverage for these items.

It wasn't a hard sell or dire consequences presentation; it was just factual and I need to deceide what and when to do about it.  I really, really much appreciate it when someone like an advisor is up front and is honest and direct with me; it builds trust and faith in what that person says which is very important.  Chis Martinez fits that description to a tee and is why I've been with RT since the beginning.  I have to admit I was concerned when Heath left; he left a big void to fill.  Chris has done it!  Whoever does the advisor hiring at RT definitely knows what they are doing.  -  Pete Araldi",4.8

2744,"March 04, 2018","Been taking our Toyotas (two 4Runners, Matrix) to Roseville Toyota since we moved to Rocklin in 1990. In early years we had used another repair shop in Rocklin on occasion but pretty much 100% used this dealer's services for over 20 years. We got to know two or three employees (Joe, Jackie, Shane) in Services & Parts departments, and stay with them, because they give honest advice and don't pressure (""BS"") us into any work. (Yes, few still do.)
I value personal touch and honesty over price, even when I was working I kept vendors because of relationships. If one can find a repair shop in one's neighborhood who's honest and reasonable price (as my brother-in-law does), great. I do pay a little premium at this place but it's worth it. Unless the cost is obviously questionable or beyond my budget, I usually do not second guess it.
For that reason, I hope our next car would still be a Toyota.",4.4

After diagnostic it was determined that the main hybrid battery was bad.
It was also recommended to change the shifter.
We brought the car in on a Wednesday and since we were going to be busy the next couple of days we couldn’t pick it up until Saturday.
I called for Cory on Monday but was told he wouldn’t be in until Wednesday. They tried to schedule me but I told them I would wait until Cory returned, he is my Service Advisor.
When I scheduled with Cory they tried to schedule me with Kyle several times, even when I arrived they tried to put me with Kyle and I told them No that I wanted Cory. I don’t know what’s wrong when you request a Service Advisor why do they keep pushing someone else on you.
Cory is my Service Advisor and I am very happy with him.
His service is exceptional and I can’t ask for more.
He is the Best.
During the time that Roseville Toyota had my wife’s Prius Cory kept us updated on the progress of the work. It should be noted that the Prius has 175,000 miles on it and hopefully the battery will give us another 175,000.
On one of Cory’s updates they ran a load test on the auxiliary battery and it was bad. Not bad, the last one lasted 7 years.

2768,"February 23, 2018","Roseville Toyota reached out to me and agreed to replace the door panel at no cost to me.  I am very impressed by their willingness to work with me regarding my 2018 Camary.  After this positive experience, I would certainly return to do business with them again as well as recommend them to someone else.  Roseville Toyota has demonstrated their willingness to take care of their customers and have restored my trust in them, feeling that they actually do respect my decision to buy my Camary from them.  Bravo Roseville Toyota.

Our Camary has a small cut in the vinyl on the top of the front passenger door panel.  This cut was already there when we first bought the car.  I failed to call the complaint in right away.  I mentioned this when I had the car in for service last week, but was told that it would not be covered by Roseville Toyota because I didn't call it in right away after purchase and all records of inspection before delivery didn't indicate the cut.  We took possession of the car after dark when we bought it, which means that we didn't immediately notice it and RosevilleToyota's staff that checked our Camary for problems probably missed it also.  I still feel, for the price we paid for our Camary and the very large down payment from us at purchase, that Roseville Toyota should cover the door panel's replacement with no cost to me.  I am disappointed that the door panel isn't being covered by Roseville Toyota for the above reasons.  This makes me question if I would do business with Roseville Toyota in the future or recommend them to someone else.  I still would like Roseville Toyota to cover this door panel's replacement at no cost to me.  For the money we paid in down payment, Roseville Toyota would still make money off the sale.  I feel that Roseville Toyota doesn't respect my decision to purchase our Camary from Roseville Toyota rather than another Toyota dealer.

When I rendezvoused with Alex at the cashier's spot, a lady named Kristina handled some of the paperwork, and tho' she said little, I could tell that she, too, was a most outstanding representative of a truly outstanding corporation.
And, this lady, Kristina, had a dulcet smile that could illuminate a sizable city.

2815,"February 13, 2018","Toyota has always had pretty good service.  The prices are definitely comparable to other local mechanics.  I brought my 2010 Corolla in for an airbag recall along with a tire rotation.  Since I bought the tires at Toyota the whole service was free.  The inspection they perform pointed out that one of the brake lights were out and the cabin air filter was dirty.  I changed those on my own after, but it was nice that they brought it up because i'm not sure how long it would have taken me to notice that the brake light was out.  

The shuttle was a bit behind, I put a name in at 8:08 and didn't get a call until 8:44.  I'm a bit surprised they don't have some sort of GPS tracking on the car.  Then they could at least inform you of the current location of the vehicle and possibly how many more drop offs, this would make it easier to decide right away if you want to wait for the shuttle or not.  After about 10 minutes of waiting I decided to just call a friend instead of waiting without any ETA of when a shuttle would be ready.  I didn't remove any stars because the shuttle just seems like an extra perk.

He ended up getting us down to within $10 of our pmt, but why did it take so long? I get it...starting at a really high number still gets you a high number, 
But don’t start so high that it makes a car buyer have to go straight for the door. Also, the advertisement for the lease is very misleading needs to be changed.

2935,"February 03, 2018","Great experience! Needed another corporate vehicle. First went to Folsom Lake Toyota; half the salesmen were too pushy and rude. I asked to get confirmation on price I was willing to pay for a particular vehicle assuming Tier 1 credit of the business...they responded saying (i) my corporation could not purchase a vehicle without me personally co-signing (which may have been a poor assumption about me and my business on their part), and (ii) that they couldn't (more like wouldn't) commit to a price until my credit was ran. Done...I'M OUT! 

Called main line at Roseville Toyota, asked for a random salesperson. Told them the Stock No. of one of their vehicles and asked to confirm price based on Tier 1 credit. He provided with sales manager approval via phone and text. We negotiated price a bit thereafter. Came in and purchased exactly what was negotiated...and yes, could be acquired by the corporation alone with proper documentation.

3067,"January 25, 2018","We really liked our salesman, Mayjohn.  He was kind, and helped us find the right car. I have bought MANY cars in my life, and I have never felt so taken advantage of when negotiating a deal.  I feel like because we had two children there that were starting to lose patience, they were rushing us through. The first gentleman spoke SO quickly and added things into the deal that I did not want (that ended up being there in the end when I was sitting there with finance. The finance gentleman made me feel stupid for saying that I didn’t want that in the deal, stating that I had “already agreed to it.”) I’m sure that is his sales “tactic”.  When I informed him that we did not want the LoJack on the car, he told me that we would receive an insurance discount, and that it was worth it.  I felt like I wasn’t able to negotiate a better deal— I feel like we paid too much for the car than we should’ve. When I called back and asked for the dent protection and LoJack removed, I was told that I could come in to sign a paper to remove the dent  protection, but that the LoJack was already in my name and that they couldn’t remove it. I’ve felt misled because I was told that we would receive a discount with our insurance company… My insurance company told me that many salesmen use this tactic to make a sale. I’ve just never felt so out of control during a car deal. I generally feel like I have made a good decision when I leave, but I didn’t feel this way at all this time. It was a real disappointment when it should’ve been exciting.",1.4

The service gentleman also told me if I give a good review, he gets a bonus and he'd give me a discount. Yikes, can't bribe me. Hopefully my opinion matters.",1.0

3106,"January 23, 2018","We entered the lot with the intent to buy a 2017 or 2018 Prius, with basic features. We quickly found two options that would work. The junior sales associate was friendly and customer centric, despite being new to the role. 

When we sat down to discuss pricing, we noticed a few things:
1) Sales managers yelling across the showroom to junior members regarding working weekends and staying busy. It seemed to us that those conversations are best handled in private.
2) Junior sales members making demoralizing comments to support staff members. (e.g. implying to the supporting staff that sales are more important than the services they are providing) Obviously, this behavior is being emulated, given the sales managers leadership qualities.
3) Misleading and confusing pricing provided by the sales manager, which did not initially include the relevent information we asked for. In addition, promotional offers that were available online were not clearly understood by the sales team at first. Once we clarified the exact information desired, the sales manager was able to provide clear numbers.
4) The junior associate was polite and respectful the entire time.
5) The finance manager was polite and respectful the entire time.
6) The sales manager used terminology like ""obviously"" and ""of course"" - implying that we should naturally understand certain things about the industry.
7) While we do feel that the negotiations ultimately provided us with a fair value and deal, the sales culture here was indicative of a cut-throat good ole boy culture that in my personal opinion should have died years ago. I will not support this type of culture in the future by taking my business elsewhere, where respect for customers AND employees is the primary focal point.",3.0

Linh has been much more than a salesman and I have considered him now as my long time friend.  Linh has always kept in touch with me since the first time we met.

I told Linh I wanted the 2018 Tacoma including all of the options and color.  Linh located the truck and kept me in the loop when the truck would arrive.  We had discussions and the sale was done before the truck arrived.  Once the truck arrived, all of the paperwork was done and I never had to go to the dealership.  

Linh went over and beyond by dropping the new truck off at my house, taking my trade-in '09 Tacoma then meeting my wife and I at my job to sign the final papers, which took 15 min.  Now, let me see any other sales person do that for a customer.  I highly recommend Linh and you won't be disappointed with his customer service.

Roseville Toyota has sales, service and parts has not disappointed me yet.  Had a small issue once with service and Cole Anderson quickly corrected the problem with no hassle.

They  had no parts in inventory to make repairs and could not provide any definite time on repairs and had many customers trucks already parked and waiting for repairs. They then told me if I didn't leave it that they could not be responsible for damages if something happened. I left with my truck and asked them to call me when they could replace my truck with a truck. There are reasons people buy trucks and not small coups.  I have to call in everyday and see when they can provide me a truck. They will not call me when they have one and they still can not provide me any time frame of making repairs.

I was not shuffled from salesman to salesman to manager and closer.  They were upfront and honest with me, and finally qualified me.

3179,"May 28, 2017","Amazing internet staff set my family and I up for a test drive appointment with Henley Hernandez on May 6,2017. Henley is a friendly person with an exceptional ability to connect with his customers wants and needs without making them feel pressured to purchase immediately. Needless to say, we felt confident in our decision and purchased our 2017 Sienna the same day. Joe Beitzel helped us in the finance department with exceptional patients with our three children while signing on the dotted line. We purchased the 10 year 100,000 mile warranty with Joe. Malon helped us set up and explain our new features upon leaving, again extremely friendly and relatable. We left Roseville Toyota feeling like family on May 6, 2017.  

My husband and I decided we wanted body side molding, got in touch with Henley who once again helped us place that order. Sally called to schedule the Cilajet Sealant application once the molding was delivered to Toyota. Appointment was made for Friday, May 26th and was told I would have a Sienna reserved for the day. 

On May 26th, Julian R. Castellan checked my Sienna in for the scheduled work and pointed me to the rental desk- that is where everything began going downhill with Roseville Toyota. Rental desk ""lost"" my Sienna reservation and tried giving me a Prius, then a Camry. I quickly explained I have three carseats that will not fit. After a few minutes I was given a Sienna. The keyfob I was given had duct tape covering the automatic sliding doors. I was told the 2016's will be recalled due to doors flying open while people are driving! That sounds criminal that your dealership would let a soon to be recalled vehicle off your lot. I was in a rush to get to work and left knowing my children would not be riding in that faulty Sienna. 

At two o'clock, I got a call from Jess letting me know my van was ready. Valet dropped my van and keys and I left for the Roseville Galleria. My husband noticed what looked like dried bird poop below one of our fog lights and oil droplets on the bumper which would not easily wipe off with a dry napkin. Nothing should have dried so fast to where I could not easily wipe off with napkin unless it was already dried before my van was taken in. I wondered if the Cilajet was applied over the poop and oil. Called Julian to explain my concern and was completely shut down right away without any concern. We immediately returned to service department where Jess and Julian met us. Juilan  quickly dismissed anything said and  rubbed  poop and oil off with a rag wet with some kind of liquid. Julian made it clear there was nothing he would say or do to help listen and try to resolve any of our concerns- we needed to take that up with finance to possibly get our money back for the Cilajet Application. I quickly brought up the fact that we would not get money back due to the application was included in our 10 year/100,000 mile warranty. Once again Julian did not care.  Jess on the other hand seemed embarrassed by Julian's behavior.

We then met with Thue Lee who quickly listened then gave us another Cilajet sample pack. Said the paint is smooth (the van is new, of course paint is smooth) therefore the application was successful. My husband and I left feeling like the outcast family member that day. We just wanted what we had scheduled and paid for- Cilajet Application from our 10 year/100,000 mile warranty and body side molding. 

To make make our frustrations with Roseville Toyota worse, Julian called us this morning (May 27) to ask when we are going to pick up our van! Sloppy and unprofessional is how I would describe Roseville Toyota's Service Center. Going forward, Roseville Toyota has lost all of our business. We will have all of our warranty work done at Maita Toyota, much closer to our home. ",1.2

They were uncomfortable but their honor was more important and they committed to the deal.

3185,"January 20, 2017","After spending a good year and a half fighting with the company of my previous car (will remain unnamed) as I had my car in the service center at least once a month I was not expecting much when I finally bought a new car. I was so drained from my previous experience that I think I was stopped in my tracks the first time I took my car to Roseville Toyota for its regular maintenance service. I was blown away by the fact they had a coffee shop and little Cafe. This was the ideal spot to spend the hour while I waited for my car. I jumped on my computer and actually lost track of time as I felt like i was in coffee shop.

Now what really got me was the customer service. I cannot.... I MEAN CANNOT... say enough positive stuff about my service rep Courtney Guetschow. Not only was she the most friendly person, she communicated with me, explained everything perfectly, made sure I did not have any further questions and kept me updated as my car went through the process. The experience was the best I have ever had... so great that I felt compelled to write a review. 

The icing on the cake is the fact i ABSOLUTELY love my Highlander. I talk about my car so much that my mother-in-law just bought one a few weeks ago and my friends are selling their Tahoe to get one as well this week. I will be urging them to have Courtney as their service rep as she just makes the whole process complete. ",5.0

Friday December 2nd 2016 I visit Toyota around 4pm to try and buy a Tundra 2017.  I obviously want a good price, i have great credit and money to put down.  Andy comes back after seeing my offer and says ""We are not a charity, we do not give stuff out for free, we are a business, we need MONEY!""  It was very condisending and rude tone.  He then went on to tell his Sales guy Naick that he is doing everything wrong and yelling at him in front of customers (me).  I just think he was very rude and unprofessional so much that I had to tell him to his face.  He then said ""You know what i don't care"" and walked into the manager office.  A different sales manager came out to comfort me (MUCH more professional) and tried to make a deal with me.  In the end I still bought from John L. but at the Chevrolet branch on Saturday December 3rd 2016.  Although John L Sullivan owns both (from what I have heard), Chevrolet is a 10/10 when it comes to customer service and kindness.  Roseville Toyota is around a 7/10 and people like Andy are what bring it down even more to a 1/10.  I will never recommend Roseville Toyota to any of my friends or family.

3192,"November 11, 2016","Incredibly corrupt dealership.  After agreeing on a sales price, I noticed that they had tacked on LoJack and dent protection within the optionals section - totaling nearly $2000 for optionals we had not been notified of.  When I indicated to the sales department that we did not want those optionals, they told us that we could not purchase the car without taking those options.  We had already spent 2 1/2 hours at the dealership and I was exhausted (should have walked).  We foolishly just communicated how disgusted we were with the whole situation and then finished up the deal. The weekend was ending and my husband urgently needed a car.  I won't even bother describing what happened in the financial services department.  But, in both departments, we noticed that they had listed our phone numbers incorrectly and that they had not listed our email address (wrote ""did not provide email address"" though I had indeed done so).  Meanwhile, every department is pleading with us to give a good customer service survey when we leave.  However, when it was clear that they were not going to get one because of how poorly they treated us in both departments, they completely falsified our contact information in the Toyota corporate system.  I just got off the phone with Toyota corporate: Roseville Toyota had given them a completely fabricated email address, completely fabricated phone numbers, and completely fabricated mailing address.  Meaning they were purposefully preventing Toyota corporate from being able to survey us on our sales experience. It would have been comical if it had not been so obscenely corrupt.  These people may have succeeded in giving Toyota a bad name in my family, though I have been a loyal Toyota fan and customer since 1989.  The only thing that they did right was that - after I lodged a complaint with Toyota corporate, they rewrote the contract to remove the optionals that we had never wanted.  I would have been happy at that point if they had followed through with updating our contact information as requested to 5 seperate agents at Roseville Toyota.  They absolutely refused. No, it would have been more honest to refuse.  They claimed to have fixed the information, but instead created new fabrications.  Disgusting business practices.",1.0

3195,"October 03, 2016","I wanted to trade in my Kia optima for a Toyota Prius. Turned into a 6 1/2 hour headache. I wanted a Prius that they had advertised online, a sales man approached us very quickly (12:00pm) as we pulled up which was nice, but then we walked around the lot trying to guess where the advertised car was at, then the salesman drove us around every lot/dealership/repair area they had for about an hour. Me and my friend asked if we could just wait inside for the sales person to find it, but the salesman said ""maybe you will see another car you like while we drive around."" 

We finally find the Prius advertised and it was at a repair area of one of the dealership's, both the front and rear bumpers had scratch marks from whatever the previous owner drove/backed into. I was OK with the condition the car was in. Then we drove over to the main dealership and waited for the next person to help us.

The next person let me know that I would not be able to make the trade without putting down the 7k difference that I would owe since the Prius was much cheaper than the car I was trading in. Then another person told me that they might be able to help me out if I get a more expensive Prius, so that the difference price wouldn't  be what was holding me back from making the deal.

I decided I would be ok with getting a much more expensive Prius, plus the person I was with had to be somewhere important at 5:00pm. We walk out to the lot and picked out the second newer Prius we looked at, I didn't really care at this point, after all any of the newer Prius's were going to be better than the one we initially came to see. 

The rear bumper on this newer Prius had hit something, I could tell because it didn't line up just right on the passenger side and I was able to jiggle it a little. Don't get me wrong my trade in had scratch marks down the side of the wheel wells, the rear bumper was split open in the middle, the rims were all scratched, and the front driver side Controll arm or something was damaged so the car wanted to pull to the right a lot.... 


I didn't expect for good money on my trade in, I feel what they were offering me for my car was very reasonable, but no one said anything about the bumper on the Prius. It didn't feel right after they bragged about some 121 point inspection, and that the car fax says that the car has never been in an accident. Whatever, I would be ok with it I just needed to keep moving forward with the whole process.

I wasn't very pleasant at this point, at around 6:00pm I get to the finance guy, and this guy started out super nice and really fun, but I told him that I was trying to still get my friend to his appointment even though it was an hour after 5:00. He was totally cool about it... Then he started offering the typical gap insurance, tire warranty, etc. I turned it all down, then he offered some coating for the car to protect it and I would never have to wax my car, he told me that all the finance people were having a little competition of who could sell the most of those, I turned it down and that's when his attitude completely changes. He became short and quiet after that, pretty sure it made him mad. I asked my buddy if he felt the same about that and he said he was thinking the same exaxt thing that the guy went from nice to quiet and bored with us.

They finally hand the keys to the Prius over, but the car wasn't ready, so now I'm really frustrated, and then the original sales man walks up to me and says the finance guy says he needs more paperwork. They guide me over to a computer that is available so I can rummage through my emails/bank statements/etc to get them the info they need. They still say I need more info.

This is the point that my friend looses his cool and starts telling the salesman how ridiculous this has become. A few more people notice us throwing a fit and then they tell the salesman to just follow us home to pick up the necessary paperwork. We tell the salesman that we have to get to a meeting, that might not even be happening amore because it is now 6:30. Another gentleman tells me that we can just email the info.

We leave in the Prius, we drive right back up with the paperwork that they needed, because the meeting was cancelled because the interviewers could not wait any longer for the meeting. I make sure they make copies of everything. They tell me I'm all set. So I leave.

Today I'm on my lunch break I missed 2 calls and have a text message....

3202,"June 03, 2016","Please read this before going to the dealership for service. I really don't want what happened to me to happen to anyone else. 

I've always had my car serviced at the dealership & recently moved to the area so Roseville Toyota was the closest dealership. I had my tires rotated & an inspection done. I got a laundry list of things that were wrong with my car that were not wrong 3,000 miles ago. They told me they did a ""thorough"" inspection on my vehicle. They were so pushy that I get the service done that day or within the week. I wanted to get a second opinion before shelling out $4,500. 

When I got my car back my back sun shield didn't work and my front passenger window didn't work. I called the dealership & asked to schedule an appointment to fix what wasn't working. They had the audacity to tell me that I would have to pay, up front, before the dealership will even look at it when it was a simple fuse fix. They said I would be reimbursed if they found they were the cause of the issue. 

Fast forward 2 days after service. My battery light comes on & then my car died in the middle of the road. I called AAA & they stated my alternator went out. Toyota's ""thorough"" inspection showed the alternator as fine but the battery needing a recharge. THREE different AAA mechanics stated the disbelief & with my car's low mileage that the alternator went out. When I told them I just had it looked at by the Roseville Toyota dealership all THREE (they came out on separate occasions, 1 battery, 1 tow & 1 more battery) all said that the dealership is very crooked, hurting for money & has been known to purposefully sabotage vehicles so customers would have to bring them back in for repair. 

I called 2 different, highly rated & recommended, mechanic shops. They both stated I was not their first customer whose brought in a vehicle from Toyota with the same laundry list of issues. When I brought my vehicle in, behold the inflated issues that Toyota presented to me were FALSE! For example, Toyota stated my rack & pinion had gone out along with my CV boot. Upon close inspection, by my choice mechanic, they stated NOTHING was wrong with my rack & pinion. It was just my CV boot flinging grease & it didn't need to be changed & nothing was wrong with it. Let me tell you that more than 1/2 of Toyota's laundry list was completely exaggerated. 

Instead of spending $4,500 I walked away spending $650.00 in repairs with a new battery.

3224,"August 30, 2015","It was the WORST EXPERIENCE ever! I've never felt so humiliated in my life! Never ever go there! The staff was arrogant, disrespectful!

Here is my story;
I got the best quote for 2015 Camry SE from the Miata Toyota Dealer, everything was perfect over there, they respect you, try to make you satisfied, and leave the dealership happily; but Miata did not have the Silver color.
So, I tried calling the other dealerships and asked them if they had the Silver color. Elk Grove Toyota said they don't have the Silver color and apologized for that.
After this call, I called the Roseville Toyota, talked to the salesperson who must be Shaun Thornhill; I explained everything in detail to him that I visited / talked to 3 different Toyota Dealers in Reno, Sacramento, San Jose; all of them said that they could do the price-match while talking on the phone, but when it comes to visiting the dealership and I get there, they said they cannot do the price-match with the Miata etc.; yeah after explaining previous experiences; HE SAID that Roseville Toyota is the #1 and BIGGEST dealership in North California, and HE GUARANTEED that Roseville Toyota can do the price-match and also give the best price to the customers! I reminded the previous experiences 3 times on the phone to the salesperson, but he again GUARANTEED that they can give me the best price. He said that the only thing I should do is to come to the dealership, and then don't worry about the rest. AND I DID THAT! I trusted them and drove 125 miles which takes 2 hours from RENO, NV to ROSEVILLE, CA. BUT I WISH I DIDN'T...
When I got there, starting from the first person and first minute, before starting to test drive and the paperwork, I asked them again and again and told them that ""I have the quote from Miata which is really good price, let's not waste both your and my time, I want to continue if you can do the price-match"", and every time I said that, each person said ""Don't Worry, we guarantee you that we can do everything; price-matching or giving you the best price"". And believed them.
I did the test drive, started the paperwork, they run the credit and gave me the offer. Here is the SURPRISE! I was really surprised, disappointed... I felt that I should have never trusted them!!! They gave me ridiculous offer! I emailed them the previous quote that I got from Miata Toyota; it seemed that they did NOT even take a look at that quote!!! So irresponsible, amateur, humiliating!!! 
I should NOT have waited there for one more second, but I had a hope that there was misunderstanding and they would fix it. But the case was totally different!!!
The salesperson came and talked to me, gave me the offer, I denied, gave him my offer, he goes back to the office / finance department, comes back, so and so forth... This process took more than 3 hours!!!
I understand the process, but as I explained the salesperson in the dealership, my question was really clear; ""Is Toyota LIABLE for the person that I talked on the phone?!"". I said ""the salesperson on the phone GUARANTEED that they can do the price-match or give me the BEST PRICE only if I show up and be at the dealership?!"".
On the phone, ROSEVILLE TOYOTA IS LYING, DECEIVING the CUSTOMERS!!!
They want you to come to the dealership, and then they play with the numbers / words etc.

I asked the salesperson in the dealership that ""LET'S LISTEN TO THE PHONE CONVERSATION TOGETHER and YOU'RE GOING TO SEE WHAT YOUR GUY GUARANTEED!"" but as you can guess; he said he listened to the conversation, and ""there was no GUARANTEE, but try their best to help me!"" This means that I'M LYING! Can you believe that? The salesperson is claiming the customer as a LIAR!!! WHAT KIND OF CUSTOMER SATISFACTION POLICY IS THIS?!!!

Then, he claimed that the quote that I got from Miata is not REAL, there is something wrong etc. Then, they tried to price-match, but this time gave me other extra fees... Do you get the point?!!!
They don't want to make business, but waste time.
They tried to bring me different issues such as I'm not qualified for 0 downpayment and 0% APR... Next time, the salesperson went and came back and asked for the $2,000 downpayment. I offered $500, he looked like he would accept, but again said NO!
Lastly, he said that I have to wait 48 hours for the approval, and after that I can get the car.

As you can see here, they try to deceive customers; they promise / GUARANTEE that they are the BEST and they can give the BEST PRICE or price-match; but IN REALITY, THIS IS TOTALLY A LIE!!!

I felt really bad and expressed my opinion, but instead of trying to make me relaxed and feel comfortable, he acted like he wanted to kick me out!

They checked the MIATA's quote, after realizing that they cannot do the price-match, they claimed that this quote is NOT REAL :)) so funny, right?
Is this the professionalism? Is this the BEST & BIGGEST Toyota Dealership in North California?!!!

Please, don't tell anyone you are making THE BEST BUSINESS!!!",1.0

3226,"August 03, 2015","I have been a loyal customer since before it was Roseville Toyota. I have purchased numerous cars over almost 20 years and have always had a great experience.....until this last time. I purchased a brand new 2013 sienna. I had problems almost immediately. Took the van in numerous times to have the leather fixed (Dealer works), the pannel on the drivers seat , trim on driver window coming down when window was rolled down, chair arms tightened, blue tooth system reset and several trips back (including leaving both my phone and van there), arm bolt covers reinstalled numerous times, and much more. Each time they fixed the problem i ended up going back and leaving my car. The last few times the panel on the driver seat came off they started hassling me. One service manager tried to charge me to fix it. Each time i insisted that they fix the problem at their cost. Then I started dealing with a service supervisor. He seemed really helpful in the beginning. ..then after the last time the seat frame came off he ordered parts and had me bring it in. When I came to pick it up to my suprise the paperwork said things like ""one time good will fix"" and seat problem due to outside source or something to that effect. And after market seat heater etc. I refused to sign the paperwork and left. I called and played phone tag with Cole for about 2 weeks then finally got him. I told him I bought the van brand new from the dealership so how could anything be after market? I have owned 3 other siennas and never had these problems. Also what outside influences? ?? I am large but am 80 lbs lighter than I was with the other 2 vans, so if its not my fat butt what could it be? My children are older and totally out of the kicking my chair phase. Other than being irritated I have never yelled or swore at anyone at Toyota! Our last conversation where he basically told me this was my fault ended mid sentence (me speaking) with a dial tone. I called him back and got his voicemail, so did he hang up on me??? I have been planning to go back and purchase a car for my daughter.....not so much now!!! I will be talking to my lawyer in the near future. I have never hated a vehicle I have purchased from this dealership.before now I just wish they would take it back!!

3231,"May 21, 2015","I recently purchased a used 2015 Ford Fiesta from this dealership.  After researching this particular model car I found a car on Roseville Toyota's website.  Talked to a nice salesman who seemed really enthusiastic about working with me on financing (I have poor credit). After several days, the salesman calls back and says that the bank prequalified me and to come in and drive the car. I made an appointment for 5:00pm that day to meet him at the dealership.  I arrived at 5 but the salesman was nowhere to be found! Instead I got passed off to some older salesman who didn't seem to care about me or making a sale.  I told him that I had been prequalified and wanted to drive the car I had seen on the website.  No such car existed!  He said that it had been sold and that the dealership just forgot to take it off the website.  We did find an identical car on the lot with 2 more thousand miles on it but the price was $1K more.  After arguing about the price difference, I decided to drive the car. Some test drive!  He just sat quietly while we drove one time around the auto mall. He didn't even try to sell me the car!  No explanation of the cars features, etc.  Thank goodness I did my research on the car.  We get back to the dealership and start the negotiation process. They did drop the price to match the one that supposedly was sold. 2 hours later and we finally hammered out a deal that worked with my limited budget.  Another hour of signing papers, getting 6 references, going online on their computer to print verification of insurance. Then another round of signing documents with the finance manager who misrepresented the factory warranty on the car so he could push the dealership's pricey extended warranty (which I turned down). They did beat me down on the gap insurance.  Then I was finally shown the door where the salesman gave me the keys and said enjoy the car. I drove home tired and hungry. A few days later, I was told that I had to bring my 78yr old mother in as a cosigner even though I had listed me spouse who is employed full time on the original credit application.  I was not happy and let them know that I was not going to put my mother through the ordeal that I had gone through.  The assured me that it was going to be quick.  We came in and no finance managers were available!  After demanding to see the manager of the dealership, we were finally shown to a desk where we signed all new paperwork.  The one bright spot was that somehow the gap insurance price became lower which lowered my payment slightly. Oh and my mother had to provided 6 additional references which were offered to the finance person but refused.  Another day later ring, ring and low and behold it's the dealership asking for the 6 references!  I sent an email back with them.  I still haven't received anything about the finance company that actually approved me for the loan.  GRRRRRRRR",1.5

3249,"December 29, 2014","BUYERS BEWARE, even if you have a signed contract, made a $2,000 down payment, and made your payment on-time, Roseville Toyota may still try to take your vehicle back from you after 37-47 days.

Since I had a previous bankruptcy and a newer job, I sought out special financing at various dealerships. After speaking and working with the special finance staff at Roseville Toyota, I purchased this vehicle from them on 10/25/14 and gave them $1,000 as the down payment.

Within 10 calendar days, Roseville Toyota found a lender to finance the vehicle for me with my credit and work history but based on terms different than what was agreed to on 10/25/14. Roseville Toyota requested I come in to re-sign another contract with an additional $1,000 down payment; which I did on 11/04/14.

On 11/15/14, “Armando” called requesting proof of residency for the other two individuals residing at the home. He said acceptable examples of this proof were paystubs, utilities bills, bank statements, etc. I sent via mobile text photos the documents to “Armando”.

On 11/18/14, “Cara” called stating they still needed the information requested by “Armando”. This time, I sent two emails with attachments to “Armando” and “Sean”. After sending these emails, I received no further communication from Roseville Toyota until 12/11/14.

On 11/20/14, the DMV titled the vehicle with me as the registered owner and mailed the proof of registration.

On 12/11/14 (47 calendar days after Contract #1 and 37 calendar days after Contract #2), individuals from Roseville Toyota called me to tell me I have to return the vehicle. They said the lender kicked the loan out and they weren't going to finance the vehicle for me.

On 12/12/14, I spoke with individuals at Roseville Toyota and they threatened me with vehicle repossession, application fraud and legal costs plus fees associated with reclaiming ""their"" vehicle.

On 12/15/14, I spoke with the special finance manager who said due to lack of lender financing they need the vehicle and there's no in-house financing available with Roseville Toyota; a member of the Sullivan Auto Group. I explained to each of the callers the situation as I saw it on both Contract #1 and Contract #2: ""Seller's Right to Cancel"". They had me come in within 10 calendar days to re-sign. Either way, it was already past the 10 calendar days for the Seller's Right to Cancel. Roseville Toyota and Sullivan Auto Group should be held responsible for their actions of harassing, intimidating, threatening and lying to a buyer/consumer.

On 12/19/14, the 1st monthly payment of $344.40 due on December 19th was delivered to Roseville Toyota via USPS Certified Mail.

As the ""Buyer"", I held my end of the contract on multiple occasions. As the ""Seller-Creditor"", Roseville Toyota should hold their end of the contract by finding a lender on these terms or to in-house finance the vehicle within their dealership or Sullivan Auto Group. I believe they also have a business by the name of ""Sullivan Auto Credit"" so it is difficult to believe that they are unable to ""in-house finance"" as they claimed by phone.",1.4

The first time was amazing and so was the second. Unfortunately when we were going to get out second car, we had a guy named Ray instead of Todd. This guy was so rude. He didn't shake anyone's hand or tell us his name. The first thing he said was ""How do you pay your taxes?"" How is that relevant at all. My mom was working the deal because the guy got on my dad's nerve. The whole time( 1 hour 30 minutes) he disrespected my mom. Also, he kept saying how this might be too expensive for us and our payment might be too much to handle. And even though my mom said don''t worry about the payment, he kept asking us about our taxes and financial stuff. He said that we could go and just shop else where we can get a better price. We finally agreed on a price and when we were going to sign the papers, we noticed that wasn't the price we agreed on at all. He charged us twice for tax. He even left and everyone was looking for him. We said no that the price was too much even though we were trading our truck in as well.

Razwan waited for us to arrive, despite the fact that he was already off for the night.  He was very quick (which was very much appreciated since I am pregnant and have very little patience and stamina, especially since I had not eaten since lunch time) and walked us through all the paperwork within an hour or two.  He explained what we were signing and answered any questions we may have had.

I have been to many dealerships, even many Toyota dealership, but purchasing a car has never been as easy as it was with Razwan helping us.  At prior dealership, I felt rushed, as if the salesman either did not want to help us or wanted to get us to sign the paperwork before we changed our minds.

3279,"December 14, 2013","My husband and I purchased a used 1999 Camry from Roseville Toyota in 2002.  Our experience then was fine.  We love this car but after 227,000k miles, it was time for another car.  We went it in early November and we were greeted by a friendly, younger male (don't know his name).  After asking a few basic questions (horsepower, gas mileage) about the newer Camrys, he said she was going to get someone else with more experience and who was more knowledgeable about the cars.  Not good that he didn't know himself but he was smart enough to get someone who could help us.

We drove a Camry Hybrid with Chan.  We liked him but I did not like the way the hybrid drove.  After doing more internet research I decided that I would look at the Camry V6 and the Acura TL.  I went back in early Dec.  I asked for Chan but I was told he left to start his own business.  I worked with Hamid who was a nice, friendly young man with 6 months experience at this dealership.  He also told me he owned a 1997 CamryV6 and a 2012 CamryV6 so he had experience with the car I own and the car I wanted to test drive.

We took a red Camry SE V6 out for a spin.  I really did like the car but I was not ready to buy because I did not have my husband with me and I still wanted to test drive an Acura TL.  He said we could just run the numbers so I could go back and let my husband know what our cost would be.  He also said he would get some payment for bringing me inside so that would help him. I agreed.  He had me fill out some paperwork but without my SS# so my credit would not be checked at this point.

After waiting for about 20 minutes, Andy, a finance person came out.  He verified the car I was looking at  and asked me how my credit was.  I told him it was ""not that great"".  He spun away and disappeared for another 20 minutes or longer.  He came back and set a paper down in front of me that showed me payments of $575/month over 60 months with $5000 down.  This is on a car that was listed at $21,000.  I am sure my eyes popped out of my head.  I asked him what interest rate this was based on.  He told me 15.99%.  I told him we were approved at our credit union for 100% financing, $25,000 at 5.99% for a max of 72 months.  He said, ""well, it would have helped if I knew this before.""  I thought to myself, ""you never asked"".  I told him the credit score I got from Equifax and he said he was sure he could beat or match our credit unions financing.  I found him to be arrogant and rude. 

I went straight to Niello Acura where the experience there was wonderful.  I ended up very happy with a certified 2010 Acura TL with 18,000 miles with a payment of $372/month over 72 months and $3000 down.  I don't know what kind of math they are doing at Roseville Toyota but I can't imagine paying more than $200/month for a Camry!  

Also, I don't understand why the sales staff does not know the answers to simple questions about their cars.  I understand not knowing all of specs on all of the used cars on their lot but they should at least know about the Toyotas.  In fact, I asked Hamid what the gas mileage was on the V6 Camry. He told me it was 25/35.  In reality it is more like 19/28.  He should have known this if he owns the car!

I told him I would wait until he found the right car and then get it from him and he said there were none in California. I went home, got online, and found one at Modesto Toyota, bought it online for 3,500$ less and picked it up the next day. The car is perfect. I took it to Roseville Toyota for its first service and to have a button replaced that never worked and they kept the car the whole day and never fixed the button. The service guy said he would call when the car was done and I had to call him at 430 in the afternoon just to find out he did not even get it fixed, CRAP.

Andy said ""Ok, you're fine, you should be ok."" After about an hour, he came out of the office and said, let's go ahead  and find your car.  I said, "" what?   Am I approved, he nodded with a big smile and said yes.  I asked ""but what's the % rate"",  He clearly stated, "" you got approved for a 0%"".   I said, "" That's great but I wasn't really expecting 0 %"" and he went on and explained about how special financial department works and that since he's selling a lot to customers, finance dept would grant it so he can bring more cust. in.  ???  So we went around the lot, had my test drive that turned out to be the worst nightmare in my history of car purchase.   You all know what happened next.  I signed all the papers and brought the car home , as they took my otehr car as trade in.  We had the chance to enjoy the vehicle for 11 days until finance dept. (Zack) called and gave me unacceptable options which we didn't take and so was told we had to return the car.   I was so upset but was never rude.. He apologized ( sincerely I would assume ) but he wanted the car back like that same night which I didn't agree and explained it's unacceptable, I didn't have any clue at all??? All along i thought the deal has been finanlized now he's telling me no bank would finance it unless blah blah blah.  I told him again how frustrating and upsetting it is and he said he understands, I hanged up the phone.... Thought about it overnight... researched and learned that it's not the first time it's happened to customers of this dealership.... learned about what they call "" spot delivery"".  I just thought, ok, we'll just return the car, don't want anymore headache,   we shouldn't have trusted them in the frisrt place but then again it hurts to think that they've taken advantage of you.

We went over it again .  My initial question was ""  what happened there?"", I didn't have a clue that financing was still pending??""  I was given the impression that it's been approved, and since i was signing papers w/ Toyota finance on it, I thought they finaced it.  He explained and asked  me "" why there are 3 cars in the credit report?? "" My reply :  Well , they asked me that prior to purchase and I told them , one is being paid by a cousin and they didn't say it would be a problem. Then he asked ,  ""you have a missed payment with Toyota"", what was that all about, Again I said,  they asked me that too prior to purchase and even asked me to write down the reason.  He's starting to sound sarcastic and so I said.  """" Well isn't that the reason why you ran the credit?? to check and see , if a deal is even possible??? I mean if you're doing it for a while, you could have already known???  ( at that time i had 9 notifications of credit check ).  He replied "" Well, what do you think?? Do you really think it is possisble to get financed w/ 3 cars??? .  This made me more so upset that  I was crying out of rage and  said "" Why do you sound like you're blaming me for even purchasing the car??? I should have read all the reviews about your dealership before I even went there.  They are all true and I cannot believe it's happening to me. And you know what? you're are being rude.  All I wanted to hear from you at least is that you sincerely apologize for what happened ""  He raised his voice and said "" and now you are giving us accussations!!.  I hanged up the phone, feeling so terrible. I asked my husband to go ahead and return the car.  then I got a call from Robert , from sales dept. I believe, who offered to be our contact.  He at least sincerely apologized for what happened and offered to be the POC. I asked if they will still buy the car that is in their possesion  for 2 wks and they agreed.  They faxed papers for us to sign , faxed it back.  Gave them time to process, followed up after a week... pending... after another week... was told check has  been ,mailed... after another week ( this week ) , I was told "" Sorry , they'll have to wait until the title transfer is completed.

My attempt to purchase a vehicle from Roseville Toyota was the WORST experience I have ever had buying a vehicle.  I could go into detail of how the interaction transpired; but I will try to keep it brief.  I hate leaving bad reviews of any kind (if you can’t say anything nice…), BUT the person I dealt with at this dealership was all kinds of bad.  I didn’t ask him how long he has been in auto finance, but I will in the future.  The “Special Finance” department’s physical location and decoration (or lack thereof) is a great indicator of what the company thinks of those particular types of customers. It basically a warehouse that is made up of three primary colors: grey, grey and greyer. 

The décor was a small thing compared to the shady, unethical and unprofessional manner I was treated.  I completed the initial process online and submitting my personal information. I then sent electronically my documents ahead of time to ensure that if there were any issues, that would make the purchase not happen, I’d save myself the hassle of someone driving me 60 miles on a Sunday afternoon. The process started on a Thursday and my appointment was on a Sunday, plenty of time for anyone with a clue to know if something was a “go” or not.  Suffices to say, I went to the appointment as planned on time with a family member. Went over the process, was shown a car not they type I wanted for $3,000 more than I wanted to spend, and then ended the appointment with the finance guy telling me a bold-face lie and no vehicle.  That would have been bad enough, but two days later and 13 (yes - THIRTEEN) hard credit inquiries later, this guy would not return a phone call. I ultimately had to send him a sternly written email to get him to reply.

Dear Roseville Toyota,

As a matter of saving the universe from your less than above-board practices, might I suggest you divert some of those advertising funds, for publications that obviously are not your target audience, and invest in ethics and customer service training for your employees.  On your website you promote your dealership as honest and straightforward, unfortunately I experienced neither.  In the future I will return to companies that treat their customers with respect. Such as Folsom Lake Toyota and Kuni in Sacramento, where my household has purchased three vehicles collectively over the past 10 years. I will also encourage everyone else that I know who wants to buy a vehicle to do as well.

3284,"June 10, 2013","We have purchased two cars from these folks and still get service done here. For the most part we have been pleased with the overall experience.

However, I inquired about a used Infiniti they had on the lot (not an ""ad vehicle""), but out of all the dealers we had contacted about various cars we might be interested in, this was the only one who would not come down on the price - at all. That was disappointing to me since we had been longtime customers.

We ended up buying another Toyota a few days later from a different dealership.",3.6
3285,"May 29, 2013","I visited the Roseville Toyota dealership on 5-28-2013 to look at Prius models for purchase. I purchased a new 2008 Prius from Roseville Toyota previously. 

Prior to arrival, I had multiple email exchanges with seller Brittania Petersen, since I live 125 miles away. I wanted to make sure advertised models were still available. I communicated with Ms. Petersen about the availability of the two Prius Two and one Prius Three on special, and she confirmed that the dealership still had the sale vehicles as late as Sunday evening. I was unable to travel to the dealership on Monday, but communicated again with Ms. Petersen late that day and said I would be at the dealership on Tuesday. I recognize it was my mistake to not confirm again availability of vehicles, but I incorrectly assumed Ms. Petersen would let me know if they were not available, especially since my communication with Ms. Petersen (both email and phone conversations) involved inquiries about availability of the advertised vehicles. The email string to which she last responded on Tuesday afternoon (1:19 pm) had made this clear. 

Upon arrival at the dealership I waited 10 minutes for Ms. Petersen to come out to tell me she was with another client and introduced me to another sales representative who would serve me. The salesman immediately started discussing other vehicles as he walked me into the lot, because he said it had been a very busy weekend. He repeated that he'd help get me in a vehicle as close to the sale price ""as possible."" I affirmed I wanted to start with the vehicles on special. The salesman appeared to have no idea of the sale price, because after I insisted I wanted to see the vehicles on special, we headed back inside the dealership so he could look up the vehicles and their price. I don’t understand why he didn’t start with this. But supposedly one remained, which by the way was NOT the color of either of the two models Ms. Petersen said were on sale in the Prius Two category.

We walked the sales lot to the likely places the vehicle might be and then walked entirely around the sales lot. The salesman then said it must be in their other lot ""across the street."" After walking some more to find a key to a vehicle to drive across the street, we secured a key and vehicle and drove to this other lot--which was actually 3/4 mile away. The salesman then proceeded to drive around trying to get a car to respond to the alarm button of the supposed sale vehicle. 

Ridiculous. 

After the unsuccessful search and return to the dealership headquarters, I said I was leaving and asked the salesman to call me when the car was found. I said I was off to another dealership to look at another model. 

I never heard back from Roseville Toyota. No apology, nothing. I guess they were busy trying find their lost car. I now wonder if it ever existed.

The irony: I wanted to view the specials against other vehicles with more options. But if we couldn't even find the specials, or, perhaps more to the point, I couldn't get a straight answer, they weren't going to get my business.

We went in to purchase a land cruiser.   They said they could match the written quote we had from another dealer which was $200 dollars over dealer invoice.  Quote ""it is not worth losing a customer to sourthern california over the price.""  Before arriving we had already sent them the exact quote from the other dealership.  Three dealers in LA were already bidding for our business.  This dealership was condescending.  One would think when both buyers have credit rating over 800 with income in the top 2% of all Americans the car dealership would act in some professional manner.  Instead they wasted 2 hours of my time.  You can rest assured that I am now sending them a bill for my time at my normal billable rate per hour.

Roseville Toyota uses sleezy used car lot salesman tactics.  Makes me really wonder if they did this just because we are female or if they act so badly to all of their customers.  They wasted my time showing me how to get monthly payments down by extending the months to pay it over when all I wanted was the cost of the car out the door.   I did not need their help with the financing.  I guess that the sales staff must have flunked math class because no matter how you divide it out the final cost of the car is still based on the initial cost of the car out the door.  They never moved from MSRP.  

They also advertise a military discount.  This promotion is running on a sign on their showroom floor .  I had submitted my request in advance to USAA and knew exactly what the Toyota dealers in Northern and Southern california were supposed to quote for this military discount as well as for the few extra options for this car.  It seems their support at this dealership for our military is all lipservice.    

If you want a new car call David Sanchez at 714-522-6144. He is the Internet sales manager at Power Toyota in Buean Park and he will give you the best deal available.  Buena Park was no hassle, no haggle policy.  They even threw in the accessories I wanted at no extra cost and matched the USAA financing rate.  Basically for the 6 hour drive I saved $7000",1.5

Called 2 days later to see if they would accept my intial offer, they said they can't and since my sales rep was not there he told me to come the next day and he would do his best to get them to lower it a little more. Went in and would not even accept the fact they had offered me the 23511 out the door. They wasted a total of 5 hrs of my time, did not honor there offers and were VERY pushy and would not return my registration.

When we signed the sale deed, FI guy spent all time in selling the warranties and insurance and no explanation for the sale deed figures. Already exhausted, we assumed all was as per the discussion and signed all. After returning home, we reviewed everything and were shocked and horrified to find that we were charged 5+% APR which escalated price by $5000 over 5 years payment duration. We went back the next day to get this fixed, waited for 2 hours and then were sent back as FI guys were busy. We came the next day and with their GMs intervention, things were sorted out. After a couple of days we realized the warranties were not needed for us and went for another visit to cancel that. Waited for 1 hour and then again we were told to come after some time even though it was mere 5 minutes job to sign on a paper for cancellation.

Starting in 2004, a new Corolla S, in 05 a new Avalon Limited, and a new 06 Highlander that were all originally purchased at Vallejo Toyota where we lived. Since our move to Sun City Lincoln Hills 3 years ago, we have been more than satisfied customers using Roseville Toyota Service and Parts dept. And now we have a new 2012 Scion/IQ that we absolutely love! Roseville Toyota/Scion excels where other fail. I recently sold my 05 Avalon thinking my wife and I will be just fine with only the 06 Highlander. Well I was wrong...We never were able to put both vehicles in the garage at the same time because of exercise equipment and workshop space... So if I wanted to garage two vehicles the new vehicle would have to be mighty small in comparison. Fortunately a very personable salesman by the name of 'MO' started working with us for a few days showing different cars to decide on. Mo then smartly suggested the 2012 Scion IQ! After test driving this vehicle with Fleet Manager Richard and researching and reviewing the IQ, I fell in love with this diminutive car and found the measurements would fit perfectly in one of our garage slots. Now definite Kudos’s has to go to Linh Nguyen who has an absolutely great personality for auto sales. He was extremely helpful, courteous, informative, did I say helpful? And expert at his craft regarding sealing the deal which included finding a much lower interest rate, based on our good credit score. Linh also sold us on a few optional upgrades that I was not going to initially purchase. I am so glad I listened to his advice regarding the upgrades...My new IQ is perfect now, and I couldn't be happier...On to the parts department...Kudos'; to Jim Powell and Joe Brazil for excellent customer service skills and being total professionals behind the counter...They always make it a pleasure ordering parts...

3295,"April 09, 2012","We found a truck we were interested in online and requested a price quote.  The quote was emailed to us and was followed by an email from Richard.  We decided to go look at the truck since the price was right and it looked like a nice truck.  After meeting with Richard and looking at the truck, we decided to take it for a test drive.  The truck was listed at $11,998, but was in excellent condition with low miles.  I asked why it was so cheap and if something was wrong with it and Richard just responded that since they're a Toyota dealer, they try to move the Dodge trucks off the lot quickly.

About 2 hours into the process and after paperwork was being filled out, we were informed that the online price and the price they had emailed to us was incorrect and the best they could do was $14,988!  Richard talked to several people and they weren't willing to budge on the price because of what they paid for it. Richard was pleasant to work with and I'm not sure he had any say in the pricing.  An interesting note on this: I had brought the email with us and had showed it to him before we even test drove the vehicle. 

We decided against the truck and after leaving the dealership, I decided to call back and talk to the sales manager, Charles, to see if he could offer any help.  After calling twice, I was able to talk to him.  When I explained the situation, his response was, ""well, people make mistakes and it happens in every industry.""  He didn't offer a solution, to help or even look into it.  When I told him what truck it was, he actually laughed at me, saying I should've known that a 2008 truck with that low of miles wouldn't be priced at $11,988!

I've been a sales manager for years and would never treat any of my customers that way.  Offering a solution or at least saying you'll look into it is part of being a manager and being in customer service.  I completely understand that mistakes can be made, but it's how you correct them that matters.  I have other friends who have gone to this dealership as well and have had problems and complaints.  I would strongly suggest people to think twice before going to this dealership.

The funny thing is, we found the exact same truck (same year and features), with less miles for the incorrect price it was listed for online!",1.5
3296,"March 24, 2012","Our initial visit to the dealership was right out of the car sales textbook.  One salesman (Brent) greeted us, we took a couple of test drives, and when we didn't immediately commit to buying, he excused himself and came back with another salesman (Rozzi)...this is a classic dealership scenario...I believe it's known as the ""turnover"" system. Brent then asked us what he had done wrong that we didn't want to buy either car, saying he didn't want to get in trouble with his manager.  The old guilt trip ploy.  Rozzi started right in with his pitch.  My wife asked if the car we were interested in came in a pearl paint job.  He said the one we were looking at was pearl (it wasn't).  He also tried the guilt trip ploy, and when I said we were looking at other makes of car (Hyundai), he started bad-mouthing them, saying they weren't quality, why were we bothering to look at them, we shouldn't be comparing apples and oranges, etc.  We asked how much we could get for our trade-in...he went and got still another person who took all the information on our vehicle and said he'd call us by 5 pm without fail.  He didn't.

When we got home, I went online and looked around the Roseville Toyota website, and asked for some additional info through a link on one of their ""Internet Specials.""  David Feiss called me within 10 minutes.  I told him about the other guy not calling us with a trade-in price.  He took the info right then while I was on the phone, and gave me a value with a $500 spread.  I asked if he could hold the car for us (it was a particular color my wife wanted), and he said no problem, he could hold it for 24 hours, no deposit or anything.  When we got to the dealership the next day, he was at a sales meeting, so we worked with his partner, Nelson Pu.  No high pressure, no guilt trips, he just gave us the straightforward information we asked for, told us what our options were, and committed to taking our trade-in at the middle of the price range Dave had told me earlier...which is how much I expected to get.

Buying the car actually became fun after we started working with Nelson.  To find him, go to the Roseville Toyota website...click New Vehicles or Pre-Owned, then click Internet Sales Department.",4.6

My first impression of Roseville Toyota was with Richard Blackburn.  He was extraordinarily helpful, professional, and truly symbolized the meaning of an Honest Businessman.

While closing my deal with Richard, I again was pleased to meet his Customer Relations Manager John Roth.  Again Mr. Roth like Richard, epitomized those qualities that every consumer looks for in a Car Sales Representative, yet rarely experiences.

At the connclusion of the sale, I was again impressed with the superior efficiency and professionalism of Anthony Kailany and Sean Lyons.  Both gentlemen continued to receive and then pass on the torch of excellence in customer service.

3301,"November 16, 2011","We visited Roseville Toyota to look at used Tundras, and to entertain the possibility of trading in our current Toyota Tacoma. We knew we could sell our truck as private party, and could get the current Kelly Blue Book value for it ($12,000). When we saw a used Tundra on the used lot, the salesman had asked about Tacoma for a possible trade-in, and had even mentioned that Tacoma's hold their value, and that it will sell quick. We really liked the Tundra we saw, so we went into the showroom to see what they would offer us for our Tacoma. We expected to be low balled, especially when trading in a vehicle, so we were expecting them to offer us 6-$7000. The salesman asked us for our keys so he could look at the mileage, vin #, and overall interior condition of our truck. Once he came back and offered us $3900 for our truck (YES $3900!) we were a bit insulted, and were no longer interested in a trade-in option. Before we knew it, we looked outside and the used car sales manager was in our truck, and driving it off the lot! We had never been introduced to the used car sales manager (Lance Duarte), let alone did he or the salesman ask if it was okay that they ""test drive"" our vehicle, or see if we needed anything from our vehicle (my purse, and work computers were inside the car). We understood that if we were seriously considering trading in our truck, then of course the dealership needs to test drive our vehicle. That wasn't the problem. The problem was that after they insulted us by offering $3900 for our Tacoma, they then took the liberty to take the keys, and drive it off the lot without our permission. We were very upset and immediately wanted to leave. The sales manager brought our car back. When we explained that it wasn't appropriate for him to take our truck off the lot without asking us first, his response was ""You gave me the keys."" 

We had never been introduced to the sales manager, nor did he introduce himself. After we left the lot, we received a phone call from the sales manager. When we told him why we were frustrated, not only did he NOT apologize, he continued to defend his actions and blame us for giving them the keys. With that being said, we will not be returning to this dealership, nor will we recommend this dealership to anyone. Too bad, because the initial salesman was great (Chris, I believe, is a recent hire), and we were not only considering trading in for a new vehicle, but looking at the possibility of purchasing another Toyota vehicle as well.

3302,"October 31, 2011","I live in SoCal and had been looking for a 2011 Tacoma X-Runner. There were none  - zero, zip, nada X-Runners in SoCal but Roseville actually had a selection of them. I was reluctant to travel 400+ miles to shop for a new Toyota at a dealer I  knew nothing about, but that was where the trucks were. I initially contacted John Roth, who introduced me to Dan Wermuth.  Dan was superb in demonstrating the truck and assisting me in all phases of purchasing the X-Runner.  Dan knew as much (or more) as I did about the X-Runner, and I had been driving my own old one since 2006!  It only took a few minutes to agree on a price, and the deal was done in another hour. Kelly Myers, one of Roseville's Customer Service Representatives did a great job explaining the operational details of the truck and even found me a couple of sandwiches and sodas to take with me on the long drive home. The F&I guy was easy to work with too! 

I'd rented a car to drive to Roseville with hopes of striking a deal, and Dan patiently accompanied me to the AVIS office to drop the rental and bring me back to Roseville Toyota - what a nice guy!

I can't express how lucky I was to be able to buy the truck through Roseville, as I know many dealers don't operate with the integrity and professionalism of Roseville. Although it would be unlikely anyone I know in SoCal would go to Roseville Toyota to purchase a car, but if you are in the market for a new car or truck check them out and ask for Dan.

I said are you sure because I will need to take my diabetic medication soon.which I left at home.he told me it would be quick.I told him all I wanted to know was if I would qualify for the 0% and how much they would give me on my truck for a trade in.he keep pushing to take a test drive in a truck that I did not even want to buy. I kept telling him I dont want to drive it cause I know how it drives cause I already own one but he would not let up.It has now been over an hour and still no answer on the financing which he told me it would be a couple of minutes.then comes out the sale manager who added more pressure on me by getting me to buy a truck I did not want. it has been over 3 hours now and still no word on the financing and I had already told the salesman and the manager that I would need to go home and take my diabetic medication because I was feeling week and getting a headache and feeling sick.I did have my coworker there with me who witnessed all of this.they had asked for my truck keys within the first hour I was there.I had asked for my keys so I can have my coworker take me home and take my medication.they ignore my request and kept my keys.and moved my truck some were else and locked it with out me knowing about it.we have not even made an agreement on my truck for a trade in. It has been over 4 hours and I feel that my blood sugar is getting low and I don't feel like I have the capacity to make a sound decision.I believe they took advantage of my condition.I ended up signing the documents under distress because I was feeling very week and had a big headache and I told them several times I was not feeling good and that I had a headache. they keep saying we are almost done after many hours later.If I would have had my truck keys I would have had my co-worker take me home so I can take my medications but I could not do that since the salesman had my keys and did not want to give them to me just so he can make a sale.with regards to how I am feeling.they took total advantage of my sickness and something needs to be done about it. these sales people are very calloused.Like i said before I had asked for my truck keys so I can go home and take my medications and they did not seem to be concerned about me taking my medications. because they kept telling me we are almost done but we were not.

We contacted John and he set us up with Peter Agerton who worked with us to pick out the car (White 2010 Prius with Nav and Leather Seats (Grey)).  Peter was able to locate a car with everything except the Leather Seats (Medium Grey). Peter updated John and at that point John contacted other dealerships in the area to see if they had a Prius that met our requirements (none in the area). John offered to swap out the fabric seats for leather in a white Prius III with Nav and then gave us the price for the car out the door. We didn't have to haggle over the numbers since John is the “GO TO MAN” who determines how low the dealership is willing to sell the car.  Please note that time was a factor to qualify for the $1000 Toyota Match and the 5 yrs. 1.9% financing.    This was a done deal.  (PLEASE NOTE with previous car purchases with other dealerships we have work hours with car salesmen who would go back and forth with their fleet leads (my wife and I are tried of this type of ploy...just give us the bottom line price for out the door...please and thank you.)

Before driving away with the car Jessica Romero from the dealership provided us with an overview on how the features worked.  Jessica synchronized our Blackberries to the Bluetooth.  Several days later my wife returned back to the dealership to do some other business and Jessica noticed her there and inquired if she needed assistance.  My wife indicated she wanted to see someone in the Service Dept. and Jessica walked her there. On the way to the Service Dept. my wife mentioned her cell phone kept dropping off the Bluetooth connection.  Jessica worked with my wife and reestablished connectivity.  What amazed my wife was that the problem was not the Bluetooth option in the Prius but a setting in her personal cell phone, which Jessica was able to remedy.  My wife expected Jessica to be knowledgeable on the Toyota options but not on all the different features and functionality on people personal phone systems.

3319,"August 15, 2010","I was very pleased with my experience at Roseville Toyota.  John, the Sales Associate, listened patiently to the list of things I required of my new vehicle.  He showed me the vehicles he thought would meet my expectation and did not try to pressure me into something I did not want.  I was also introduced to the Service Department and shown where to take my vehicle for service.  Mr. D'Angelo, the Asst. Sales Manager, was very helpful and fair when we haggled the price for my trade-in.  He also was very cordial and concerned that we were happy.  Devon, the Finance Manager, explained all the paperwork and options in a timely and pleasant manner.  Tracy made sure the vehicle was detailed in a timely manner and was very helpful in showing me all the buttons and functions of the vehicle.  All in all it was a very pleasant experience and the staff has continued to follow-up to make sure I'm completely happy with my new Toyota.  I would highly recommend Roseville Toyota to anyone interested in a vehicle.    ",4.8
3320,"August 14, 2010","Chris Scarbrough was very polite and quite knowledgeable of the entire process of purchasing a vehicle.
My car buying experience was very pleasant and informative. I was given all the time I needed to get to know my new vehicle before I left the dealership; which was important to me. 

Thank you Chris.

3322,"August 05, 2010","My buying experience was a very positive one at Roseville Toyota/Scion. 
Dan Wermuth, the Sales Person I was dealing with, is a very pleasant and helpful person.
The dealing was short and haggle free and this is the way I like it. He came very close to my bottomline expectation as far as my trade in vehicle was concerned and we quickly made the deal.
I would certainly recommend the Roseville Toyota/Scion dealership to anybody I know.

3323,"July 31, 2010","From the moment we arrived we were greeted with a friendly smile from Chris Scarbrough the sales person who helped us , he was courteous and listened to what we were looking for in a car , Chris answered all our questions we had about the car we were going to purchase. From that point on anyone else we had to talk to was just as courteous . We would definitely recommend Roseville Toyota as a good place to purchase a car. Sincerely Jerry and Gloria Bindi.",5.0
3324,"July 28, 2010","Last month, we purchased a new Camry from Roseville Toyota.  We had an excellent experience then.  This month, we purchased a new Corolla from Roseville Toyota.  We cannot imagine a more stream-lined car buying experience!  We also cannot imagine a more professional and friendly team of people.  

Dan Wermuth is everything we could want in a car salesman.  There was no hassle: he was very straight-forward and pleasant to deal with.  We felt that he gave us a good deal and made us aware of all our options.

After we agreed on a sale price and filled out some paperwork, we were off to finance.  Philip (not sure of his last name) was also excellent.  He recognized that it was late in the evening and that we had just gone through financing with our purchase last month.  He very succintly, but completely, made sure we were aware of all we needed to know and quickly had us sign all that we needed to sign.  He was also a very congenial person.

Tracy (not sure of her last name) showed us the Corolla before we drove off.  She, too, was friendly and thorough.  She made sure we knew what we needed to know before we drove off the lot.  She even mentioned how we needed to be sure of letting our insurance company know of ALL the safety features in our new car to maximize our insurance discounts.

All in all, a terrific experience!  We WILL be back!

3325,"July 26, 2010","We delt with the regular sales department on Saturday July 3 - Terrible experience - Mike D'Angelo(closer) would not sell us the car at what turned out to be the internet price. He may not have been aware it was on the internet and wanted the the listed price only - not willing to deal at all. We were there over three hours and could not come to an agreement. What a wasted day and awful experience.  I would not buy from the dealership if I had to go through that again

The next day I called the internet/fleet/direct sales department and it was a very comfortable experience buying our car.  Robert Capestro, and Devon Gibbs were both helpful and professional to deal with - not at all like our experience the day before. Robert listened to my telling of our experience the day before and the car was purchased at the price we were willing to pay.  

Buying a car should not be the ordeal that the original sales experience (Saturday) was made to be. People willing to put out the amounts of money involved should be treated courteously and respectfully without being huarranged.",3.0
3326,"July 23, 2010","Most of the deal was done through the internet and over the phone. When we went to the dealership it was only about two hours. We did not have a trade in. When we visited the service department for the Protection Package, we were treated very well. This is our second Toyota from Roseville Toyota and we would most likely go back.",4.6
3327,"April 21, 2010","Very Very bad experience had to explain my need and what car i need to three different sales person..Very pathetic please don't even think to go there..i was treated as if i was a shit..I was just honest that my friend got it for low price in Bay area and i said the same thing to the sales guy and he pointed at me and said ""GO TO BAY AREA"" rudely so i got up and i am never going there back again.. and also when they new i was there to look for new Camry 2010 LE still they kept me showing Camry 2011 and when i picked up a car then they say that it was sold once and its been driven 600 miles..the are big CHEATERS..",1.0
3328,"June 10, 2009",STAY AWAY FROM THEM.  THEY ARE ALL LIARS AND WILL SCREW YOU OVER.  My boyfriend and i went in for a truck.  got a nice one.  6 weeks later they couldn't find a bank to do the loan.  had to take the truck back and they wanted to give us another one.  we signed all of the paperwork and then they cancelled the deal.  now we have no truck and have missed a lot of work to care to their needs and stupid mistakes.,1.2
3329,"January 23, 2006","I went in looking for a Tacoma Reg Cab, 4cyl with air.  Sales staff refused to listen and kept pushing V6 and extended cab versions.  I firmly told two of the sales people I was not interested in 4cyl only because I want a truck with good fuel economy.  I was then told they couldn't help me, even though they had several 4cyl Reg cab Tacomas on the lot.

The long and short of it is, they are only interested in selling what they want to sell, not what the consumer wants to buy.",1.0
