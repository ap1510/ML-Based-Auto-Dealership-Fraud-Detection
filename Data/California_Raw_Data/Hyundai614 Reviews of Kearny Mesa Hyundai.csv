0,"January 01, 2020","Brook Govan the IT sales manager was great to deal with. We had been let down twice by our local dealership in Orange County and close to giving up on buying a car. Thankfully we reached out to Kearny Mesa and was introduced to Brook. He listened to our concerns and wishes and went above and beyond to make sure we got everything we needed. It was because of Brook we drove all the way from Orange County to San Diego at 6pm to get our car. Well worth the drive.

What sets Brook apart is that he's not a pushy sales guy, he wasn't trying to force us into buy add-ons or take something we didn't need. He is very knowledgeable. He comes across as your best friend's dad, who is super nice and caring. He even messaged us the next day to ask how our journey home was. 

We will definitely return for our next purchase and highly recommend Brook. ",5.0
1,"July 12, 2019","Well, I could write for days on the poor service.  But recently my wife scheduled an oil change.  They are so proud that the wait time for a simple oil change is 2-5 hours.  
Well in addition to growing old waiting for our car to be done.  They got the wrong date and wrong phone number.  They refuse to call my wife and will only call me.  We put my number on their do no call list and they continue to call.  They said it must be a scam, but I could hear other Kearny Mesa Hyundai reps talking in the background when I answered.  They continue to call me.  Over 6 in 6 hours today.  And they still have the wrong service date, even though we called and made sure they had the right date.  Now thwy want to know why I did not show for the appointment that we never made.",1.0
2,"April 20, 2018","I've been coming to this location since I moved to San Diego but today I had a HORRIBLE experience and don't want others to go through anything similar. I came in for a simple oil change and after the man helping me checked the mileage on my car he proceeded to tell me about a 30,000 mile inspection. He made it seem like an included service. He then wrote up some paperwork and when I asked about the estimated charge he said I would not be charged that. I signed the paper and waited about two hours for my car to be ready. Then, I got screwed with essentially $300 in labor cost for the service I specifically confirmed I wasn't being charged for and I got zero benefit from the unnecessary service inspection they preformed. Biggest rip off EVER! I won't be back....",1.0
3,"December 23, 2017","The General Manager, Dave, and sales person, Suzette, were both amazing.

28,"November 21, 2017","Anit, just wow. I went into the dealership broken and out of hope. Owing 16,000 on an 03 tacoma trying to get into a family vehicle. Every other dealer had told me they cant help me. But Anit bent over backwards for me. He showed me all my options, and talked with me about rebates that could help my equity problem. He got me in a 2017 tuscon brand new, with almost all my negative equity absorbed. He stayed late to make sure the vehicle was squared away and did everything possible to get me the best deal available. As an active duty sailor i really appreciate his honesty, and non-bs approach. Just an amazing salesmen.",5.0

33,"November 13, 2017","I chose to return to Hyundai Kearny Mesa following my first positive experience with leasing a vehicle earlier this year. Being that all my information was in the system, my salesman Andy breezed through the leasing process. I told Andy I wanted something essentially the same as my 2017 Hyundai Elantra SE equipped with BlueDrive and 3 months of Sirius XM for free considering it was in my price range of under $200/mo. I was not told any other options at that price range. I was not offered to see any other models or styles. Everybody wants the signing to go as quickly as possible, but I would also like to know all of my options at this time considering this is a vehicle I will be driving for the next 3 years. Andy pulled up and connected me to a 2018 electric blue Hyundai Elantra SE with no backup cam, bluedrive, or Sirius radio installed. I also noticed the rims were not to my liking immediately and mentioned that to Andy who told me the car was already under my name so basically there was nothing I could do. Andy has great personality and is very friendly and fun to be around but I felt like it was almost a distraction from what I see as a downgrade from the car I previously had leased.",2.8

39,"November 04, 2017",Got the exact color I wanted  The exact car I wanted  Delivered to my door step with a full tank of gas  Spent all the time I needed to teach me how to use the new technology features Made sure I was 120% satisfied before the sales person left my office.  This was the easiest and the most fun way I ever had in buying a car.  Thank you!,5.0
40,"November 03, 2017","I have only had this vehicle for 12 days and so far I am not impressed with mileage or performance.  I purchased this vehicle for the electric plug-in feature and only receive 25 miles instead of 27 as advertised.  Proper instruction was not provided regarding the vehicle driving modes or features so I have had to educate myself by reading the never-ending bulky and not very helpful vehicle manual.  I have driven between San Diego and Los Angeles for a family trip to Disneyland and was disappointed in the gas per mileage use.  The vehicle is a comfortable drive but not powerful at all.  And, the many features offered can be quite cumbersome and overwhelming but nice once you learn what they are and how to use them.  Maybe once I understand how to better drive the vehicle I may be able to maximize all of the features and learn to really enjoy the vehicle.",2.0

66,"September 29, 2017","After looking for a vehicle for over a month, I happened to land at Kearny Mesa Hyundai.  It was a stroke of good luck, for me, because I got THE BEST salesman, EVER - Andy Pabon!!  He listened to what I needed. We test drove a Hyundai Santa Fe and after showing me many of its features, I was sold.  Once I knew what I wanted, next came the TEDIOUS paperwork . . .  Andy efficiently filled out all the paperwork and before I knew it, I was purchasing a Hyundai Santa Fe that is just perfect, for me.  Andy is a great listener.  He is an amazing teacher - he taught me how to use many of the new things on my vehicle. He is very personable and even cracks a joke, every now and then.

70,"September 24, 2017","Joe Dolin is the only reason we didn't return our lease.  He was professional, courteous, and exemplified the true meaning of customer service throughout this entire process.  Joe guided and helped us during and after the sale, going above and beyond to meet our needs.  He is a true professional and an asset to that dealership.  Because of Joe Dolin, I will proceed with giving this dealership high ratings.  However, Cody, should be chastised for his behavior and lack of customer service.  Cody was surprisingly rude, insulted me and my husband, and was overall a poor representation of Kearny Mesa Hyundai.  My recommendation for Cody is to receive further training in customer service.  The ratings below reflect our positive experience with Joe Dolin.",4.8
71,"September 23, 2017","First time I ever walked away without buyers remorse.  I love my new car.   Anit, my sales guy actually listened to what I was looking for, kept myself and my husband on track.

I as a married female was buying the car for me even though my husband was with me Tom addressed all my issues directly to me One of the reason I bought the car from him He was not pushy and did his best to speed up things He always followed up with us,4.6
84,"September 05, 2017","Like the car, staff was friendly and professional, but I think like all other car dealerships, you are told what is needed to make the sell.   Get all of your questions/concerns taken care of before you purchase; if you don't you will hear ""crickets.""",3.8

Although the car was delivered to my satisfaction, I didn't know that it was supposed to arrive with a full tank of gas--the tank was maybe 2/3 full.

I was told they owned me $11500, which I have not received. When I asked about this I was told it could be up to six weeks before I receive the funds. I find this unreasonable, that a dealer would hold funds for that length of time. I took my car to car max, and they offer me the same amount.

The salesperson was nice - but I suspect him and his ""managers"" were just in on a big scheme. DO NOT GO TO KEARNEY MESA HYUNDAI. In fact, don't even buy or lease a Hyundai.

131,"July 21, 2017","My buying and financing expirience was excellent. Tony and the finance manager that helped us did an amazing job doing everything to get me a great price on my Elantra without any hassle. I purchased my car late in the evening and they were in no rush to get me out of there, they took time to ensure I was aware of all the terms in my contract and took great care of me. I did however notice the next day that the car was not very clean even though the detail crew at the dealership had the car for 30-45 minutes this was not Tony's fault. I returned the next day and Tony came and personally apoligized although it was not his fault and took the car back to be cleaned. The second time, the car was still not clean! There were stains on the back seat and I had to pay a detailer to clean my car to remove these. It seems that the cleaning crew doesn't care much for a new owners expirience. I once again returned and had noticed some damage done on my bumper. I had had the car for 3 days and only drove once, this had to occur at the dealer. I returned to the dealership, Tony again went out of his way to do everything to help me and now my car will be repaired next week. The takeaway from this all is that Tony does a great job to make sure the customer is comfortable during the purchase and after leaving doesn't just forget about you. He will continually go above and beyond to help and this really stands out to me. The cleaning crew and their supervisor who made excuses as to why the car was returned in poor condition do not represent the service that I recieved from the sales person Tony. They did not seem to care. Kudos to Tony and the finance manager who helped me through all of this.",5.0

133,"July 20, 2017","Kearny Mesa Hyundai/Subaru is THE best new car dealership I have ever experienced. My wife and I have been to many until we discovered that the Forester from Subaru was going to be her next car. After experiencing the other dealerships, coming to Kearny Mesa Hyundai/Subaru was a breath of fresh air. Not long after she got her Forester Limited I had sold my Toyota Pick-up and needed a fuel efficient suv with at least some bells and whistles to fill the void. Coming back to Kearny Mesa Hyundai/Subaru was a easy natural choice to begin my search. Based on some of the 90's Hyundai's I had driven in the past I had some negative thoughts about buying a Hyundai in today's market. Well, Hyundai has really upped their game in materials and craftsmanship since the 90's so my my old opinion has changed.  The People: My experience while searching for a replacement for the truck I sold started with ""Big Al"" Alonzo Blowe. He was super patient with me and very helpful in my search. I was looking at the Crosstrek and hopeful to get the 2018 when it came out. Later I discovered in my email an add from your internet sales department on low lease offers and it peaked my interest to really look at the Hyundai offers seriously. Once again ""Big Al"" to the rescue. He gave me more information on the offer and proceeded to locate the vehicle(s) I was interested in. The Santa Fe S and the Tucson. A day or a few days later I returned to the dealership on a day that ""Big Al"" was off. The very conscientious (receptionist)? at the Hyundai building then introduced me to Brook Gaven who also was very patient with me. I had a lot of questions about leasing and about the Santa Fe and Tucson that were answered right away. Brook continued to be my contact person for my Hyundai Lease and through him I am a proud owner/leaser of a wonderful blue base model Tucson.",5.0

Made an appointment and showed up at 8 a.m. and there were two cars ahead of me. The service writer said it would be about 2 1/2 hours to 3 hours. I told him I was going to have to wait there for it, so I was glad it wasn't longer. 

At 11:45, almost 4 hours later, he came up to me to ask me what I was having done on the car! I looked at him incredulously and said ""You haven't started on my car?"". He said no, they hadn't. He said they only had one tech (mechanic) on Saturdays. Wow - it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that there is no way in xxxx that my car could have been ready when promised - since there were two other customers ahead of me (including one brake job). They outright lied.

I took my car and will never be back. Now I have to rent a car to go up north next weekend.

366,"October 20, 2016","My primary experience with Hyundai dealerships was at the Kearny Mesa Branch and my closer Poway Branch where my wife bought her last car. While I was treated well at both branches for test drives the email responsiveness from Kearny via Jay Noblezada was the fastest and most consistent. Before deciding to go with Kearny I did attempt to contact Poway but their email responsiveness was slow and an attempt to contact the rep who gave me a test drive their was not immediately responded to.  I priced two trims of Hyundai Elantra's 2017 which I knew I was interested in at all Hyundai dealerships between here and LA. In both cases Jay's response was among the quickest and best initial price with a clear and accurate breakdown of dealer price with and without incentives. He also only showed me vehicles matching what I asked for. Follow up questions were answered quickly.  In the end based on pricing, responsiveness and quality of each response I decided to buy from Kearny Mesa. I might have been able wait to attempt to get Poway to respond with a price match, as the branch is slightly closer to my home, but I wanted to give my business to the sales rep that was most helpful in my initial search.  Once I got in Jay moved quickly and efficiently to let me evaluated and test drive my chosen vehicle in person. Final pricing moved quickly as we had already gone through all of the basic, financing, down payment and out the door cost discussions. He polity presented additional warranty and service features most of which I declined.  Aside from a bit of a wait to see the finance representative to sign the final loan paperwork, as I showed up pretty close to the end of the business on a Saturday, my experience at the dealer was quick and everything went as discussed in our email communication with no surprises or disappointments.   Overall I was very satisfied with how I was treated by Jay and my new car has meet every expectation I had of it with no problems so far. I am pleased I was able to find this car at a fair price locally in San Diego as it will be nice to be able to take a short drive to the Kearny branch if I run into any issues with my new vehicle and possibly for servicing.",5.0

I had received a certified letter earlier today stating that the leasing transaction from the day we leased the car at the dealership, had been rescinded and cancelled and I was urged to return the vehicle immediately.  While we were generally pleased with our experience at the dealership the day we leased the car, the recent actions of the dealership have caused us to be very disappointed and reluctant to recommend this dealership or Hyandai in general to anyone else.

Came by the next day, the scratches were still there. (By the way I live over 40mins away so it's not an easy chore to get to the dealership). They said that they would fix the same scratches the next day and would deliver the car. The next day I asked to have them send pictures of the fix before they came. The scratches were not fixed although they swear that they were gone but the sales agent still saw them and the scratches showed on pictures. Spoke to the sales manager, Cody, whose was extremely rude but he called it ""being straight forward,"" and we decided to cancel the sales agreement Because the service was inferior, I was lied/mislead to multiple times, and more importantly the sales manager was extremely rude.

425,"July 27, 2016","At the beginning of this survey I said the sales person did not ask me what my needs are in buying a car. That's because when he greeted me I started the conversation with what I was looking for. He then directed me to the cards in my price range. As far as setting up Bluetooth, I beat him to that as well. before he could even say anything I already had my phone connected. He did show me some options of the car, ( How to adjust seats, lights and voice commands) As for navigation I was told I can use it, but I was told how to set it up. ( meaning I need my phone connected to the car via USB not Bluetooth) Didn't take me long to figure out. Over all the salesperson was very nice and very helpful. What matter to me the most is he did not try and up sell me. He tried his best to keep everything within my price range. The cons: 1. In the end the finance guy kept on trying to sell me on stuff. Tint my windows for $ 600.00. Are you nuts! I can get it done for $180.00 with lifetime warranty on parts and labor. I'm already max out on my monthly payment now you want to add that to my monthly payment? I did take the gap insurance because I felt that was important, and alarm program. 2.Payed extra for the car alarm feature ( little green light in my car), and the next day I was called by Hyundai asking me if it was on. I told them no and I had to bring my car back to have them fix it. 3. As soon as I brought the car home it started vibrating. I let it go for about while hoping it would go away but it didn't. Called in and they fixed it but what I didn't like is the counter guy acted like he was doing me a favor stating "" there will be no charge for this""  The car is two weeks old. There better not be a charge for something that was Hyundai's fault. (loose AC wire) Overall I liked our sales guy. The finance guy was ok but I could tell he was a BS'er. As for the car, honestly I really like it. This is the first time I have bought a VERY brand new car .( meaning 2017 with only 73 miles on it) I did my research and Hyundai has some really good reviews, and the same with the dealership. Do I think things could of been done different in some areas, yes, but in the end the sales guy did a good job and the dealership over wasn't bad either.",4.4

We are very pleased with our experiment with the Genesis. We have owned Mercedes for the past 30 years without exception and switched for this Genesis. There are some improvements which need to be made to the Genesis. It needs better shock absorbers so the car doesn't bounce around so much. The front passenger seat needs better padding. The steering wheel needs to be sturdier feeling than the current one. The fuel filler cap and fuel door are quite flimsy and need to be beefed up with a proper place to store the cap during fueling.

575,"September 16, 2015","We originally were in contact with Carlos but the morning that we were supposed to meet with him, we were late so unfortunately, he was already with another customer. We were directed to another sales professional who was very friendly and she did everything she could to get us the car we wanted with our budget. However, the only model left was the one with a faulty air conditioner that blew hot air. She said it was not a big deal and can be fixed easily. We went for it. We left with the estimation that our car will be ready on Tuesday or Wednesday. 
My husband called on Monday and nobody knew of the repair that was needed for the vehicle. The head mechanic looked on the computer and there was no work order put in. OK...kinda weird. So nobody put in the work order.
We waited until Wednesday and got the call that the part was FINALLY coming tomorrow (Thursday) and the car can possibly be ready by Thursday evening, latest Friday. OK...more waiting. Why would the part be coming TOMORROW when the work was supposed to be finished today?
We called Carlos on Friday because I was tired of waiting around without solid communication. He was surprised to hear about our story and said that this is not a normal thing. He found out for us that the car has been tampered with when it was on another lot. Someone tried to install an alarm or something, and crossed some wires. My first reaction was ""Why are we buying something that has already been messed with at the price of a NEW one?"" 
Carlos said that the car will be ready on Tuesday. It was Friday, so we had to wait ANOTHER 4 days! Whatever happened to ""easy fix, should be done soon""? The whole frustrating thing about this transaction was the downplaying of how long it should really take. It would have been fine if we were told ""OK, it will take a week or so"". But over and over, we were told that it'll be either tomorrow or the next day, tomorrow or the next day. How many more ""tomorrow or the next day"" will we have to wait through? Because we believed them and thought the car will really be ready ""tomorrow or the next day"", we've been putting only $5 in the tank of our old car each day and we've been to the gas station like 10 times already.
Anyways, we called the manager and we were offered a solution and we were ok with it, and when we came in on Tuesday, miraculously, the car was finished. Carlos was there to walk us through everything and he was very understanding about our frustration. Overall, it wasn't completely horrible, but definitely the most frustrating and awkward transaction I've had.",3.6
576,"September 16, 2015","Carlo was so great and so patient. He made car buying an easier experience and answered all my questions or even questions I didn't realize I should be asking. However, Joe in financing was so unprofessional he almost reversed how great Carlo was by how rude and terrible it was to have to work with him. Carlo is amazing but customers should always avoid Joe if possible because it'll turn their car buying experience sour even if their car salesman is as wonderful and professional as Carlo.",4.0

The sales man was who's name is Man was very nice, not pushy at all and I overall liked the car I looked at better. I was comparing the Nissan Altima to the Hyundai Sonata Sport.

The sport model is pretty impressive! I ended up buying that day!!! A week later I am very happy with my choice and everyone says how NICE my new ride is.

My only adverse comment is attached to the survey portion, and had to do with the practice style of the dealership in one very minor, but significant aspect, and was not a function of the sales person at all. Otherwise very happy.
Thank you.",4.6

594,"July 31, 2015","I totaled my 2015 Elantra Limited and wanted to replace it with the sameexterior and interior color.  Nobody could find one anywhere on the west coast but the fleet dept at KM Hyundai kept searching and so did I. I actually located one in riverside that had just come in on the truck, so I called KM Hyundai and asked them to procure it for me before it could get sold to someone else.  They got it and prepped it and delivered it to me the next day for the price I wanted to pay.",5.0

Not only were Alonzo Blowe (our salesman) and Al Debelen (our finance manager) professional, they were also a LOT of fun which made for a wonderful buying experience. They listened to our needs, and worked extremely hard to get us in the perfect vehicle. We absolutely LOVE our new car! You really have a great staff at Kearny Mesa Hyundai and every time someone comments on our new car, we are quick to tell them where we got it. Thank you again for everything!

608,"December 18, 2014",The internet sales man was Chris. He had me come in and make a contract for the car I wanted -which had to be located! I also gave $1000 down payment! When my car came in it had the wrong interior color! They could have told me that before I came to pick up my car! I was so disappointed!,2.5
609,"December 15, 2014",I went in & bought via the Internet Sales Manager Suzette & was in & out in 4 hours. I did go into the dealership knowing exactly what car I wanted & already had financing in place but the service was excellent! I would recommend this dealership & the Hyundai Santa Fe! ,5.0
610,"January 09, 2013","They do not know what they are doing!!

I took my car in for a check engine light and stall problem.  They told me I needed to replace the throttle body and o2 sensor, and that my timing belt was on BACKWARDS.  I also needed 2 new axls, I drove my car to this place, not towed.  Finding nothing wrong with my throttle body myslef, I allowed them to change it and the o2 sensor to give me a warranty for $840.  That was Friday before Christmas, Day after Christmas my check engine light had come back on.  I dropped it off under warranty, they did not like my after market gas cap, I had to purchase an OEM part from them, for $21.  Two days later, check engine light back on again.  So, again, under warranty, drove back.  This time, $520 for an air pump that ""pumps air to the gas tank and checks for leaks"".  I did not believe him, I went for a second opinion to a friend (who was too busy for me in the first place, why I went to Hyundai).  He found the hoses disconnected, one was connected using a wire tie (not OEM).  My mechanic assures me leaving these hoses disconnected is the reason why the engine light came on, not because of the air pum.  He tested the air pump, and found nothing wrong with it.  Hyundai told me there was nothing they could do for me, I should have  brought it back to them to put the hoses back on.  They do not trust other mechanic's opinions, except for Hyundai's mechaincs. 

I feel like I was taken advantage of, forced to buy parts I did not need, left vulenarable to accients and more proplems with my car, because it was left un assembled and I was given my keys back.  To all you people in the world, stay away from Kearny Mesa Hyundai.

I have pictures and receipts for any one that cares that this is how I was treated. 



The first time I ever went to this place  4 years ago they droped the car off the lift they damaged the whole left side of the car and It took a month to get that back!!!!  I didnt learn from that!!
