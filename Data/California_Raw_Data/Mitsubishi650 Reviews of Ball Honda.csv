0,"May 19, 2020","The customer service is trash and the attitudes are atrocious, I have been to the dealership on several different occasions. I've only had my car for no more then three months and each time i notice a different issue with my car and the lack of communication is terrible as well. They fail to execute protocol and return your calls back. Specifically speaking on a phone call today with Juan Espinoza his attitude was disgusting and consistently cut me off every time i choose to speak. I personally had to drive up there and speak to Al Hammerschmidt the general manager and Scott Moses the service  manager for this pending issue to be resolved. In no way this should have gotten to the point of me having to speak to them if the service representatives should have did there part prior to me showing up. The Lack of attentiveness to the customers should be priority i shouldn't have to deal with attitudes while getting my vehicle serviced.",1.5

23,"October 21, 2019","Mr Louie Limson is one of a kind employee/dealer. I was not so serious in buying a car, I plan to but  not at that time. I was not able to resist to get one from Honda because of Louie's positive attitude. So patient , understanding and so knowledgeable. He got all the good attitude of a good salesman. Try to buy a car at Honda and ask for Louie and you will go home with anew car and full contentment and a new friend. I had to cancel my plan of getting a Nissan. Dealership is not only in cars but good people who make you feel important even if you are just shopping for your future car. Thank you Louie for the good experience. ",5.0

37,"July 08, 2019","Michael Fitch earned my loyalty to Ball Honda with the purchase of my 2018 Honda Civic LX in March 2018.  Then, with my recommendation to Family to return to Ball Honda when my Mother needed a new SUV, with Michael's expertise, lead to the purchase of a 2019 CR-V EX-L. 
A month later, I returned to Ball Honda with a purchase of a 2016 Honda-Certified Used Pilot EX.

My initial experience with Ball Honda was through the Costco Auto Purchase Program.  I met with Michael and test drove a couple of Civics. Michael was not pushy with prices, only presenting the best professionalism and recommendations based on my driving and purchasing needs. 16 Months after purchasing my 2018 Civic LX Sedan:I am still extremely satisfied, which is why I was quick to recommend to my Mother who needed a new SUV. Michael provided sales options based on my Mom's needs.  My mother is extremely satisfied with Ball Honda's commitment to customer satisfaction. This continued commitment to customer excellence brought me back  a month later to purchase a 2016 Honda-Certified Used Pilot from Ball Honda. Michael was able to work within my budget and is quick to help resolve any problems as they arise. I have no doubt that I will seek out Ball Honda for Automotive service and advice.

Michael gives personal care to his buyers. He responds timely to calls and texts throughout day with encouragement when problems arise. He is quick to listen and if he does not know how to answer a question, he knows people who can. 

I am pleased to recommend my positive experience that I received when visiting Ball Honda, and look forward to opportunities to praise Michael Fitch when buying Honda.

Kevin Voshel was extremely helpful, knowledgeable and answered all of our questions beyond our expectation.

Not to mention his friendly and professional services, he went extra lengths to serve his clients.  For instance, with no prospect of a sale, he worked past his working hours to ensure I found the car that fit my needs.  After the sale, he called me up to make sure I was satisfied.

222,"March 04, 2018","1 star is still a high rating for a place like this. Management at this place is a joke very rude and unwilling to help after you have already bought your car. Gabriel Martinez is the worst car salesman I have ever had if you for some whatever reason find your self here do yourself the favor of using someone else I wish someone had given me that advise very rude and disrespectful. Mr Martinez helped my girlfriend and I buy a car he quoted us 3,000 less then what my final price actually was. He said if I put 4K down my final price out the door would be 15k after putting an additional 3k down my price was still 15k after signing the contract I realized the mistake and went to go approach and talk to him about the issue. In my hand I also have the original agreement in his handwriting of the deal he made with us when I approached him he was very rude and disrespectful and unwilling to admit to his mistake asking me ""if I knew how to do math"" obviously I do that's why I was there it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out when your being robbed. He then proceeded to take me to his boss which I'm guessing runs this poorly managed lot and that was even worse because he wouldn't even acknowledge what I was saying. His counterarguments were ""I didn't drag you in here you came to us"" and ""I should stop complaining because I'm going to make my girlfriend feel bad about the deal and I should be supporting her instead"". Who in the world is he to tell me that? These individuals have no integrity or customer service values needed to run a successful business. I acknowledge I signed a contract and it's final all I wanted was an explanation as to what happened to my 3k extra down payment and all I got was a bunch of insults and run arounds. To anyone who reads this I advise you to just go somewhere else I will never be back here and I hope everyone gets to read this and spread the word.",1.0

I disconnected the call because I cannot talk while at work and then received an email from a salesman at 619-647-4217 that states ""Nicole, if you're no longer in the market for a car let me know. We can remove you from the follow up list. You inquired and came to see some civics. You were interested in a car so we follow up to see if you're ready to make a purchase. You can reply here and I can remove you from the follow up list. Works better than hanging up the phone. Let me know, thanks!"" I was fine with his initial text but he stated ""works better than hanging up the phone"" and then made me angry as I was at work and in sales and typically, it is respectful to call once and leave a voicemail. I told him I'd never want to work with a pushy salesman and I didn't answer cause I was at work, (I didn't even have to tell him that, it's none of his business but I'm respectful.) He then responds to me completely out of line, ""Between me and you if you hvnt bought by now... is for a reason. Just wanted to close out your info to make sure to not call anymore. If u don't answer I obviously dont know why that's why I leave a message for all I know you may HAVE HAD RECEPTION BECAUSE OF CRICKET SERVICE (what???). I don't know thats why I confirm. As I confirm that you hvnt bought a car and are not in the market anymore so will close out your info. Now no one will call you for that same inquire. I wouldn't want to work with a pushy sales people either or customer who can't really buy. Have a great day :)"" I'm in sales and customer service myself and this is extremely unacceptable.

381,"November 01, 2016","Terrible service, and because I'm being judged on the condition of my car (because it has cosmetic damage from an accident) and myself, they act like they don't want to help me. And I feel they are assuming that I don't want to pay, which is strange when I already dropped about $200 a week ago, and they barely touched what was needed. I understand its a Honda dealer and the prices are not going to be cheap, but the prices should be fair and reflect the year/model of the car...its a civic for goodness sake. I was hoping to get quality service since it is a dealership, and instead I've gotten crappy customer service, no follow up, inconsistency with paperwork, misleading information. And still my car isn't fixed!! This was a no brainer- I show up with my car in the condition it is in, usually I get a laundry list of things to do and quotes so that I can have it fixed. Since Ball Honda is closer to me, I figured it will be easier for me to have my car repairs done there, and I wont have to stall any longer on getting my car fixed.
I chose to go to this place over Pacific Honda, because it was closer and more convenient for me to get to. I was hoping to get some parts covered on my existing warranty and then pay for the rest of the damages that my car has. They haven't bothered to go over any of the additional items that need fixing and replaced, which for a supposedly reputable car dealership is pretty strange. They dont want my business, which is unfortunate and looks bad on them. Thanks for judging and discriminating towards me, I really appreciate it.",1.4

Then a ""customer"" of his comes in and as soon as he sees her he said ""hey, I have to help this one customer that has few questions"" I am pretty sure if I would have told him I was ready to buy that same day he would not have done that.. Very unprofessional. Before he left he did get Alex Reyes to assist us with our questions and that is when my perception changed 100%.. Alex was very nice and very attentive to what I was looking for.. He stayed within my price range and features that I was looking in a car.

404,"June 24, 2016","This dealership lost one key transponder for our new Honda.  First we were told the key was misplaced, and then they said it was secured in a mechanic's locker for the night.  The next morning they admitted it could not be found.  We asked that the new car be reprogrammed and two new keys be provided.  They agreed and kept our car for over 4 hours (we were told this was a 40 minute procedure.)  They said they would deliver the car to us.  Then they said they had no one available to deliver the car.  We went to the dealership and they tried to give us two keys.  Unfortunately, they were the same transponder code - meaning they did not reprogram the car... they simply did what was cheapest and easiest for them.  The made us wait hours to add to their ruse while they simply made a single duplicate key. To add insult to injury we were chased to our car and yelled at by a sales manager telling us to take the car.  He screamed four times that the car was ours and he was going to leave it on the curb (they have possession of both the car and the keys.)  Then he threatened that he would ruin my 87 year old mother's credit.  I informed him that she (a widow) had paid cash.  He said we were taking this (our simple key issue) too far.  We bought a 7 year warranty and all other recommendations with this dealership.  Within a full 24 hours of the purchase, we know this is not a company with whom we wish to do business.  They are dishonest, unethical and a little frightening.  My mother feels uncomfortable and doesn't wish to return for service or anything else.

We left the unit in the afternoon around 3:00 pm,  next day I received "" in my cell phone""  the call from Jose, the assigned mechanic to check the car, he told me that the check engine light was due to the gas cap was lose, he would charge me the $115.00 for that issue, I  told him that was abusive and he told me that he had to run a lot of test to come with that result, an experience mechanic or agent could know that, lose gas cap is the most usual issue for check engines lights comes on, most yet, when cars are owned by women that they haven the same pressure to tie a cap like men. Even thought the lady who received the car the prior day told my girl friend all issues (3 diagnostics) will be covered with the $115.00 Jose told me that to check the other two issues will be $230.00 dollars more, I felt ripped OFF but I had not other choice. That day around 1:30 pm finally Jose called me at ""my cell phone"" again and told me that there were a switch that controls the back up lights that had to be replace, I told him the the principal problem that we want to fix were the shift gear stick locking itself and he assured me that switch could be the problem, at the end he charged me 496.00 for the whole thing and he was making me a favor of not charging me for the labor of replacing that switch. I say he charged me because he was the one giving me the prices. He started checking the car around 11:00 am, I received the first call around 11:30 am, by two o'clock the car was ready for pick up. that same afternoon we went for it and my girl friend stop at the market for some groceries, and what happened? When she tried to put the gear the shift stick still were doing the same locking thing, by now who ever is reading this nightmare must be tired, so, resuming, we took the car back to them on Tuesday and what happened, after back and forward, they FOUND last friday that the whole shift gear had to be replaced witch will be other 260.00 dollars and they are making the favor of not charging for labor. today, one week later I found a message in my house line answer machine from yesterday, the car was ready for pick up. We asked them to call us to our cells, we asked we work all day long, every time that we were there they wrote in work order our cells numbers, at the end of the day are ending paying 756.00 plus almost two weeks without car for a problems that could be repaired if they were more efficient.

We were so impressed with their kindness and sincerity.  I must admit, I hate walking into a car dealership when you know salesmen are going to attack before you can even walk to a car you might want to check out.   We had no intentions of driving a Honda Hybrid home, but that's exactly what we did.  They worked with us on the price and the test drive was amazing.  Sal was such a delight to work with.  We returned the following day so Sal could explain some of the bells and whistles.  He is an amazing salesman!!!  Even gave us his cell phone and said we could call him anytime.

461,"January 16, 2015","While it took longer for the other car dealers to respond to my inquiry, Ball Honda's  internet sales representative Joe Attiq responded to my email within minutes and gave me the best price so I decided to visit their site the following day.  

Louie was our sales personnel. He was very courteous and attentive to our needs. He immediately showed us the features of a fully loaded 2014 CR-V EX that was in their showroom. The price was however way higher than our budget and the vehicle quoted to us was sold out. We requested if he could find somewhere else for the Mountain Air color. He went to check with his team and came back with an offer.  The offer was higher than what was quoted to me by Joe. Instead of looking elsewhere, their Asst Manager Bernard decided  to give me the EX-L for the price of an EX. I did my own research before hand and saw that the price was within the range for the EX-L so we made a deal.  

Louie looked for the car with the lowest mileage. My husband and I took turns in test-driving the car. As he was explaining the features of the car he made sure that my husband was fully involved. We love the car and decided to finalize things with their financial staff, SID. He is amazing and worked within our budget as well.

Louie went over the features with us again and help program some things in the car including setting up the speed dial to sync with my iPhone.  I had to drop off the car the same week to have the sealant protector applied to the car. As promised Louie made sure he left the ""tire cap"" with ED who put it in right away. In addition Louie gave me a couple of keychains as a compliment. He was there when I pick up the car the following day to make sure everything was fine. He did not mind helping me out in adding a few more  phone numbers in the speed dial feature. 

Overall great first brand new car buying experience with the Ball Honda Group. Will definitely recommend this dealer - special mention -- look for LOUIE LIMSON.

462,"January 09, 2015","The team over at Ball Honda in National City are easily at the top of their class in the realm of Car Dealerships. It takes a lot of organization for an establishment to run things smoothly and at Ball Honda, there was not one bump in the road (excuse the pun).

The internet sales representative team and I had probably about 30+ emails back n forth. Every inquiry I had was answered within 5-15 minutes (during business hours). They were competitive and friendly in their price-matching and gave me the best deal out of all the Honda dealerships in ALL of San Diego including Irvine. It seemed as if they just really wanted me to be happy. Then as soon as I came on the lot to finalize the deal, the staff were personable, as if we had been long-lost friends. Yes, I am a friendly person, but I can sense when someone is making me feel uncomfortable right away- and I never felt that here as I did at another (unmentioned) car dealership. I made a few mistakes on my paper-work (since it was my first time) in the financial department, but even that they were able to easily fix and accommodate. 

The care, attention to detail, and customer service was incredible. I was in the market to buy a new car for my dad, I prayed for a good deal and car-buying experience and was led to Ball Honda.

We went to a number of dealerships near our home in Orange County, but none of them had the color we were looking for and were very aggressive about getting us into a car we didn't want. I found the color of the Pilot we wanted at Ball auto, and called to hold the vehicle. I spoke with Bernard (Sales Manager) and I explained what we were looking for and the terms of a deal we were thinking about. He worked with me on the phone and agreed to hold the vehicle until we were able to drive down to San Diego after work (2 hours drive) to see the vehicle. Once we got to the dealership, Bernard had us work with Jose Vasquez who was a pleasure to work with. Not pushy or aggressive and was very pleasant. From the time we walked in to the time we left with the new care, I think we were only there for approx 2 hours. Fastest dealership experience ever!!

I couldn't believe the horse power, the look inside and out and feel. He had explained to me all the new perks from this year from last year. I was sold right away and had to order one!! He had told me that it would possible take anywhere from 2 to even 3 weeks for the car to come in. Next week he gave me a call and said my car was here and ready to go. As far as customer service goes, I can not say enough how well we were taken care of and how smooth it was to finalize all the paperwork. Thanks to Joe in Finance.

Thank you Sadeer and Joe for all your recommendation on what I needed in making sure my car will be safe from theft and security of my family if I was to get into an accident. GOD forbid! Thank you for guiding me in getting exactly what I was looking for and stay within my budget I would gladIy recommend you to all my friends and family if anyone is interested in purchasing a new or used car.

Although, I had no intention of immediately purchasing the vehicle, I called and set up an appointment to test drive the Acura ILX and inquire further. I found the receptionist to be very helpful.

This was my first experience dealing with Ball Acura as well as my first Acura purchase.  I was extremely impressed by the dealerships overall attentiveness and outstanding customer service. The staff went above and beyond to ensure they were professional, informative, friendly, and efficient. The staff did pressure me and I felt very comfortable. 

At Ball Acura, my entire process from the initial salesman, sales manager, and financing ran smoothly. They provided a more than fair purchase price including the warranty, GAP insurance, and trade in value for my car. It was well organized and only took a few hours to complete the entire process. Additionally, the dealership was clean and offered complimentary Starbucks Coffee.

I was very pleased with my overall experience and am extremely happy with my new ILX.  I would definitely recommend this dealership and will return to purchase my future vehicles. 

Thank you Ball Acura!

519,"March 03, 2013","My wife and I had been to several different dealerships while looking to purchase a new car to replace an older vehicle. We initially were looking at several different vehicles by several different vendors. Our first choice was the Toyota Venza, but when comparing it to the Honda CRV EX we felt that the Honda was more bang for the buck. Still we were strongly considering the Venza. While shopping for the Toyota, we found that we had to stop dealing with one dealership because they honestly were horrible, and then the second toyota dealership honestly was not much better. That really swayed the Honda CRV into our top spot. Ball honda was friendly, took their time with us, was not pushy at all, and met our price that we wanted to pay. Tough to say no to them when we say we want this, this, and this, and they say ""ok"". They even got the color we wanted and the interior we wanted to the dealership within 45 minutes, gassed up and washed. Toyota told us 2-3 weeks for our color choice. It's the little things. Javier and Romeo both helped us out and got Mike, their sales manager involved. All three were helpful and met our needs. I'm not the friendliest of people to deal with (I like to get what I want) and I was pretty stingy on what I was willing to pay, but they still worked with me. We ended up even getting the 8 year - 100,000 warranty bumper to bumper, (something I never get) because we got it for a price of essentially one major repair. The Financing department was easy and detailed, and we left happy. Service here was really good. They don't hound you, they don't bug you, they just ""check in"" and make sure you don't have any questions, which of course is the best sales tactic. It worked. Our long search was over and we bought from Ball. In the week following, both the sales manager and Javier reached out to us to make sure everything was going well with our purchase. A nice touch. So, yah, I hate salesman, but I had a good time here. IF you want a new vehicle, these guys are worth giving a shot. ",5.0

Raul and Christian were open and very helpful to make sure all will be to my liking.  I will have an appointment made this Thursday for work to be done at their Honda shop.

576,"March 12, 2012","My experience with everyone I mentioned was exceptional; with the exception of the sales manager Mike Vallarelli. He was a complete idiot. He would not even acknowledge what I was asking him; in fact he told me either I was going to purchase the vehicle his way, or he was not going to sell it to me! I was irate for his total lack ,of people skills,and quite frankly somewhat amazed that he would let me walk without making the purchase. When I told him fine than I wouldn't buy the car, he put a gentleman named James Dunning on the phone. Mr. Dunning tried to make excuses, that possibly Mike didn't understand what I was asking him, and apologize for Mike's lack of professionalism, and courteousy, but my mind was already made up about him he was a total JERK. Only because of James, Dave, and Kevin I purchased the vehicle. I will never do business with that other gentleman Mr. Vallarelli again, if he is the only sales manager that I must deal with, this will be the last vehicle I will purchase at Ball. If you have any questions about my experience with Mr. Vallarelli, please call me at (619)654-1084, and I will be very happy to tell you excactly how he treated, and disrespected me and my wife. Thank you for everyone else who helped me, they were great. It is unfortunate that I was compelled to rate my experience at Ball with the lower marks, but it was because of the major ordeal with Mr. Vallarelli that drug all the other marks down. The survey asks for overall, and unfortunately he had such a negative impact on my experience at Ball that it greatly affected the overall rating, sorry but I had to be honest and I told James Dunning that I was going to give the dealership poor marks because of that JERK, Mike Vallarelli.",2.6

582,"March 02, 2012","Just a little disappointed because we were not able to see the actual Honda Civic EX Sdn we bought until the final send off.  We were dealing while just looking at the model car in the show room, expecting that we're going the get the exact same features like privacy (tinted) back windows and all in the black Civic EX Sdn in the show room.  Since we didn't like a black color car, we requested for a silver one which they said they have on stock, so we started the deal and agreed.  But then again, we didn't ask to see the actual silver one we were buying, because we assumed the whatever features on the model car in the show room are also on the silver one we're dealing with.  Make the story short, we signed all the paperwork trusting and expecting all is the same in the car as in the one in the show room.  BUT apparently not... it didn't have the spoiler and tinted back windows (all physical we saw in the model car we were dealing off of), but we got the rate posted on the wind shield though.  We asked another sales rep outside about them, and he said, ""did you ask for them?""  We said, we assumed we didn't have to ask because they're all showing in the model car inside that we dealt with.  In the end, the sales rep said, ""those are optional and cost extra.""  It was late at night already, and I didn't want to undo all the paperwork and wasted all the talking and all that.  So, we decided ""OK"", we will just vent it out at the survey, so here it is...

HOWEVER, please don't take it negative out of those employees who assisted us.  THEY WERE ALL GREAT, FRIENDLY WITH ABOVE-AND-BEYOND CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS!  KUDOS TO ALL OF THEM!!!  THANKS SO MUCH!  :)

They don't lie and try to make stuff up or then tell you that you need work on your vehicle when you do not.  For example DCH HONDA OF TEMECULA WILL RIP YOU OFF AND SUCKS. I used to take my vehicle to DCH HONDA OF TEMECULA but their service now sucks, has gone down hill and they could never fix my Honda Pilot properly.  Finally took it to National City Ball Honda and Ed Gorman had his mechanics figure it out immediately and had it fixed.  No playing games there. 

I then went back to DCH Honda in Temecula again for another small Honda Civic and the Service guy could not even quote me a price on it until he talked with the mechanic. It was a regular item on their list also. Wow, they are stupid to say the least.  I called National City Ball Honda and again took my car there and they fixed it without any problems.  Do yourself a favor and see Ed Gorman at Ball Honda in National City.  He will fix your car right the first time without trying to bs you into thinking more needs to be done. I'm in law enforcement.

The sales person was extremely helpful and all the staff was courteous and friendly. I give them high marks for that. The finance person was very helpful also. However, the carfax report took several times to be delivered to us. The had the VIN number incorrect and this almost killed our deal. The tag information was also incorrect and I had to point this out too. Again, slowing the process down. We were there for about 5 hours very late in the day so I expect that this poor performance was due to being a very busy sales day and it also being late on a Sunday. So I didn't mind overall.

608,"September 14, 2011","I had emailed to get a quote on a new Kia Sportage.  We decided to test drive and if we liked to purchase.  Frank said if he was not available to ask for Jennifer.  When my husband called both were out but there would be someone to help us and the car was still available.  

We arrived at the Kia dealer and the first red Sportage they showed us was not the car with the quote but they would find it for us. We could test drive this one. After 2 tries at trying to get the car started the salesperson gave up and went to look for another Red Sportage which was on the Honda Lot.  We took that out for a quick test drive. The car was ok and had plenty of room. 

When we got back the salesperson kept saying this is not the car from your quote we can't find it but we will.  So we waited and I was getting very irritated at this point.  What poor service all around.  Then the salesperson said he would check on the price we could get this sportage but he would have to see his manager.  OK now we have to play the stupid manager game.  He came back with a quote of $22995 which we had a internet price on a similar vehicle for $21,695.  Now I know I asked for a $24,400 red Sportage but he said there was no way the would sell a $24,400 car for $21,695. He said the internet departments only job was to get customers in not to quote them. Excuse me didn't it say get a quote right online?  

Well we just walked away. Went to Nissan, purchase a cute little Juke and drove away in our $24,000 car.  

The bottom line here is we were willing to go to $22,00 but did not want to play the game.  You lost a customer and you lost any of our future business.  It is really true what they say about a happy person really doesn't share with that many people but someone that is unhappy shares with many. So no I won't be buying a car from Ball Automotive Group and I sure won't be recommending them to anyone.

There were a number of issues we had with this dealer that made us furious and my wife normally does not get angry easily.  First of all, the sales person was ambiguous on which car we'd actually be driving home.  Minor, but these things add up.  When we went inside the room to sign papers, we asked that we change the credit card to be swiped because we remembered that that card was near its max. We wrote the new credit card info on the paper and he said he'd take care of it. The guy ended up swiping the wrong card anyways causing us to have to pay a overcharge fee.  The dealer didn't do anything to compensate.  Then when we drove the car home, the antenna on the car was missing and I noticed that there were some paint chips near the door handle.  The detailing on the car was poor quality too.  At this point, my wife is already regretting we came to this dealer.  I call the dealer and he says to come by and pick up the antenna and tries to tell me that we don't really need.  The radio would work out without it.  I listen to mostly AM radio stations, and I do NEED it!!!  That day I'm supposed to drive there ( I swear I'm not making this up) my battery dies!  I realized that my headlights were on for about an hour accidentally.  But this should be a new battery!!!  How could the battery die within an hour of the headlights being on!!!!  So I take responsibility for that, but my suspicion was that the battery was not as new as I thought.  I call the dealer to explain all that's happened to us, and all he says is...   ""Come in for a free car wash!!!""  I DONT'T WANT A FREE CAR WASH!!! I want compensation for the overcharge fee on the credit card and a car that has all the accessories on it when I purchase it, scratch free with a brand new battery!!!!  You already failed on that.  He made no further attempts to appease me and I never heard form the dealer again.  We regret coming here.",2.0
632,"March 01, 2011",I have been going to Ball HOnda for the past 10 years and have discovered year after year that their entire staff is dedicated to superb customer service. From the buying process to servicing my cars- they exceed my expectations everytime! I may be able to find slightly lower prices online- but I know it's worth a little extra money to be taken care of so well. Rich Reinebach in Sales always makes sure that I am comfortable with the price of my car (no pressure ever!)and Dave Harlan in Service is straight with me when it comes to maintenance. I recommend my friends and family to Ball everytime.,4.8
633,"January 21, 2011","Agreed to price on Jan 2nd and was car was FINALLY ready for delivery Jan 11th!!

Car was NOT COMPLETELY DETAILED and showed a lack of ""Attention to Detail"".  Body shop also demonstrated a lack of ""Attention to Detail"" by not correcting ""agreed to"" paint damage.

Another salesman was not totally truthful when questioned about which fluids & filters had been replaced.  And a sales manager tried to convince me a large dent on the roof (close to the moon roof) was there upon agreement to buy?  Both were wrong!

Was told 4 times the car was ready for pick-up...and it WAS NOT.

I would recommend the dealership to others, but only if they contacted Chuck.

638,"November 30, 2010","My family purchased an Odyssey last night at Ball Honda.  BEST experience I have ever had in my 25+ years purchasing/leasing vehicles.  Rich Reinebach and Frank Ortiz from Internet Sales beat my best price over the phone - ABSOLUTELY NO HAGGLING - really liked their approach!   We arrived at the dealership and they were cordial and well prepared to have us meet with the Honda Certified Salesman, Romeo Bundac.  This gentlement knew  the Honda line extensively  - as if he built the vehicles himself.  Other salesmen should take notice as he was very polite, patient and NOT pushy whatsoever.  He moved us along to the Finance Manager - Jeff Spitz.   Jeff explained every item on the contract - it was swift and painless and EXACTLY what was promised.  He is a true professional.  We will DEFINITELY refer people to this group.  Mr. Ball; well worth the 30 minute trip to National City.  Thank you",5.0
639,"September 26, 2010",I went to Ball for a surging idle. I had to pay them $75 to diagnose the problem. They said it was a idle air control valve problem. Seemed like a simple repair. I had changed one on another of my cars in the past and it was an easy job. They quoted me over $750 to change a part held on by two screws near the top of the engine! Unbelievable! I went to a private repair shop and they charged just over $150 total for the part and everything. They also addressed a rear brake issue that Ball overlooked. Would never waste my time at Ball Honda again... they are ripoff artists!,1.8
640,"August 02, 2010","
They replaced my transmission and the car never ran the same again. I lost power, torque, and acceleration. Made an appt and this guy with nerdy black glasses started and giving me an attitude and wanted to charge me for even inspection the mess they did on my car. Every time I tried expaining him the problem he tried to let me believe that I was just nuts and that there was nothing wrong with the car. This guys was a complete you know what! I'm never buying acura again, I'm never buying honda, I'm never going to these crooks that they don't even know what they are doing. WARNING, stay away from this dealer!!!!!!",1.0
641,"July 15, 2010","A salesman got me into buying a Civic from them, they were very helpful that time (of course!). 55K miles later, my check engine light went on, they just erased it and said nothing is wrong. Additional 20K miles later my engine started to surge and hesitates.. I know how engine works and have a service manual myself, I asked them to take a look at it and specifically check the sensors (Oxygen) and timing belt since I hade the belt replaced recently. I even told them I'm willing to spend money just to have it fixed. They said nothing is wrong and it's working normal. I did my own research and had all the other things that may cause the problem fixed first (cheaper first).. my last on the list are O2 sensors and timing belt since they cause more.. +5K miles later my check engine light went on and I WAS CORRECT! It was the O2 sensor!! I was very disappointed because if they did test my sensors (which I told them) for continuity and resistance, I could have replaced it first and save me some money! But I was wrong in trusting them and looked the other way because the dealer says they are fine! Now, the best part.. I called Parts Department to check availability and pricing for O2 sensor, they quoted me for $330, I asked them why is it expensive because Honda at Lemon Grove is offering it for $223 dollars, the guy just said Ah!, we're different company"", and hung up! Didn't even bother to see if I could get a discount!... I'm fixing my car by myself because they can not fix it in the first place, and now I get this treatment?...Fine then.. I'm almost done paying of my car.. my next buy would be a Honda Accord and it will be from Honda at Lemon Grove! (I've seen a lot of good reviews on them)... never will I come back to Ball Honda...",1.4
642,"September 23, 2009",I purchase my first brand new car here at Ball Acura. Of course they are NICE??? They are trying to sell you something right? After my purchase they are like a two-faced clowns. Just to get to the point. I got my wallet stolen out of my car by a sales men and the receptionist gave three stories how it was found. TWO days later???? They found my wallet with my money MISSING.,1.0

644,"June 26, 2008","I bought a 2007 honda civic ex thinking I was upgrading my 1999 honda crv and it turns out I was wrong.  I had nothing but manufacturer defects (about 4 so far) and when I came in to get help in fixing a crack rim they were unhelpful and gave off the impression that it was not their problem. They told me that since it was an after market product it was not their concern, but it was utterly ridiculous because everything from that car was bought from the dealership.  I was outraged for their lack of concern and I wanted to be understanding because I naively thought that Honda takes care of its customers.  I was obviously wrong because I sat in that dealership for THREE hours waiting for some kind of result and I came out there only gaining a huge headache for my problems.  It took my initiative and complaining the next day to see any results.  I highly advise anyone interested in a Honda to not go through this dealership.  ",1.8
645,"June 26, 2008","I wanted to upgrade my 1999 honda crv, so I bought a 2007 honda civic ex.  The car was beautiful, but after a year and 3 months I feel that I have been down-graded to a lemon.  I have had 3 manufacturer defects and they just sent me another one in the mail, so now I have to see if that concerns my car.  I also have a cracked rim, so I went to the dealership to get it fixed.  I was willing to pay for a new rim or to get it fixed, but when I went to the service center to get helped I was treated like a child and sat there for 3 hours with nothing but a headache for my troubles.  They offered no suggestion what so ever to help me fix my problem.  They passed me on to the manufacturer and that would have been fine,except it took my initiative and my complaints to get anything done.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS DEALERSHIP!",1.0
646,"May 09, 2008","I took my 2005 civic, which was under warranty, to them to replace my brake pads. After they were replaced, I noticed a squeaking, so I took it back. They said it was nothing. Then I took it back again, and again one more time. They said it was normal. So, I waited. 
Now, a year later, I'm not under warranty and have had to pay over 700 bucks because these guys screwed up my brakes and decided to tell me that it was nothing.",2.2
647,"October 02, 2006",I am taking a chance and posting this review even though my sales purchase of 2004 TL was just eight days ago. The tactics and salesmen were professional and exactly as I expected. They made me feel welcome and did not pressure me into purchasing any vehicle I did not want and made no attempt whatsoever to force me into a financing agreement that was unacceptable to me. I shopped around and found other Acura dealers far worce in San Diego. I would recommend this dealership,4.2
