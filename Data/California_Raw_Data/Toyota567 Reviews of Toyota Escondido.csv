1,"May 08, 2020","No one called to inform my 77yr old husband that he would not be able to sit down anywhere while service was going on. He was offered to be taken somewhere , but since he is not familiar with Escondido , he declined. That led  to him having to stand for over 2 hours while the car was being serviced. This was not acceptable!!They could have provided him with a chair somewhere.  A simple phone call to let him know ahead of time, would have resulted him to cancel appointment and reschedule,  when things were back to normal. I am truly disappointed that this took place. POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!",3.2
2,"May 07, 2020","I brought my Tundra Pro in for service and was immediately acknowledged upon arrival, despite a lot of people in line. Both the service agent and the mechanic were very interactive with me throughout the process. The mechanic even called me with some specific questions about the truck during the service, which was awesome because that prompted me to ask additional questions that I would’ve forgotten to ask. I live closer to the Carlsbad location, however, Esco has their stuff together. ",5.0

7,"February 09, 2020","I have been doing business here for for almost two decades. I use Toyota Escondido for both service and repair on our three Toyotas. One of only two places I trust to work on my 1988 4Runner. Very satisfied hence the long term relationship, not the most inexpensive but the highest quality of work.",4.6

12,"December 03, 2019","Bought a PRE-OWNED CERTIFIED car from Jim Fensey. Jim was professional and nice. The car that was sold to me though had a glued mirror, which went unnoticed until we got a car wash a month later. We immediately went in to get it fixed and they stated it would cost over $500 dollars because the damage was not covered. We then talked to Jim and he said his hands were tied and all he could do is direct us to the manager.
The manager refused to help us in any way stating it was the car wash's fault that a glued mirror that TOYOTA OF ESCONDIDO sold to me on a  PRE OWNED CERTIFIED car that passed your certified 160 point inspection broke off. After arguing with him for 15 minutes he finally said he could give me internal pricing. They called me back 3 days later saying internal pricing is over $400 still. Unacceptable. You just lost an entire families worth of business forever  and we strongly urge everyone to not buy a car from them. Next time we buy a car, it will be from toyota of temecula.",1.0
13,"December 01, 2019","I started working with Steve Uyeno on December Wednesday 25th evening him trying to look for 2019 4x2 Tacoma double cab. On Saturday December 28th we purchase what we were looking for.
Steve was very professional with my wife and I. Not pushy and made our first Toyota purchase flawless. Would recommend anyone working with Steve Uyeno.  ",5.0
14,"November 21, 2019","This dealership has provided us with excellent maintenance service for the all the Toyotas we have purchased there over the years.  They are very thorough in keeping the customer informed about the diagnosis,  work to be performed and cost and time involved, in order to obtain customer permission to proceed. 
They provide very good assessments and solutions to mechanical problems but will also let you know that you have some options that may work but that they will not guarantee.  The honesty is much appreciated.",5.0

17,"October 18, 2019","I had a great new car buying experience at Toyota of Escondido because of Shawn Skinner.  Once I expressed interest in purchasing a new car, he answered all my questions very quickly. I felt no pressure to buy from Shawn or anyone else at the dealership.  My VIP test drive appointment went very smoothly. The day I bought my car, I was treated very well.  Was in and out with my new car in about 2 hours after taking care of all the paperwork and the car was detailed. I highly recommend Toyota of Escondido if you are looking to buy a new car!",5.0

Shannon helped me she was very polite & helpful, left my vehicle for preventive maint. & she called me because they found couple of problems & she let me know price to fix & get my confirmation to move ahead. Shannon gave me an estimate time of completion & called me when my car was ready.

29,"August 28, 2019","This company needs to correct an error on my credit report. I did not authorize this company to do a credit check. Please provide me with proof that I authorized credit check.
Found place through USAA Car Buying Service. Went in with pre-approval ready to purchase. Test drove the car, the salesman LEO RUIZ, started my paperwork, ""went to speak to his manager"" then magically came back to inform me that the car had been sold.
Sounded fishy to me. A month later, found out they had ran my credit, I wasn't even there for 10 mins. I guess they realized I was not gonna use one of their credit partners so if there is nothing in it for them then they why bother with the sale. Hard to believe that an established company such as this did not know what they have in inventory and would let a customer test drive a car only to let them know it's know it's ""sold"".",1.0

41,"July 04, 2019","It only took one hour for the 15000 service on my Toyota Avalon. I waited in the showroom  where there was  WiFi, TV, snacks and water--all free, The couches and chairs were very comfy. After one hour, the service writer came and got me, explaining everything that had been done. Everything was ok, and I was happy to see my car was all clean after the free car wash I had requested.

I did make an appointment a few days earlier, asking which day was the slowest, They said Wednesday, and It all worked out, so I suggest going in on a Wednesday!

Talk about service. ,5.0
44,"June 04, 2019",I came in with a TrueCar print out for vehicle purchase and with my Costco Card for a Costco program comparison purchase. I had previously done this same thing at BobBaker Subaru in 2017 with good results. The Costco analysis printout for viewing was to have MSRP and comparison Costco saving and any dealer additions shown. Instead a piece of scratch paper had the Costco price written on it offered up by sales manager. First they tried to sell me a model with 1500 miles as a new vehicle which we had them change out to a new vehicle.  At signing a mandatory security system was added to original penciled cost and a service contract was also added that they claimed I agreed to. I noticed the discrepancies as contract scrolled by on a computer screen (someone else controlled speed of scrolling). My wife and I agreed we had not been approached about a service contract and had them modify service contract to a better term but the very overpriced mandatory security system was a bait and switch item we ended up with. We should have walked once things got fishy with demo vehicle trying to be sold as new. I received a E-mail from customer service manage Jessica Swanger as to my experience and to thank me for my business and I responded as to particulars mentioned above with no RSVP back even after a follow up reminder. My evaluation is: questionable protocol for sales process at dealership with Customer lip service. Think about using another dealership and read their reviews prior to using them. Thanks for listening!,1.8

48,"May 26, 2019","I have been coming to your dealership since 2001 for service on my car. Garth Hersey has taken care of it all of that time. Because of him, I have sent many people to your place. After his promotion, he had John Suckling handle my account. He is excellent at his job and makes the experience enjoyable.  The car is always done as promised. I gave you 5 stars because of the great service I have always received. My desire is to reach 400,000 miles on this car and with your excellent service department, I think it is possible. I'm at 340,00- now. Once again thank you for your great service department and especially to Garth and John. ",5.0

50,"May 02, 2019",Poor service communication. Dealership is very unorganized in my opinion. Technical had a very poor attitude concerning potential warranty repair. I left my Tacoma @ 8:00am. Never heard a word all day I finally had to call @ 3:48pm to find out the status. They said they needed the Tacoma for another day. I left it. No communication again. Finally I went over @ 2:30pm and picked it up on my own. I was tired of waiting Warranty  problem was never addressed or fixed.

Appointments are easy to make or reschedule.

The waiting area for service is very comfortable.

My car was taken in on time and returned to me at the time it was promised.

I cannot comment on prices because this was a no charge mandatory computer software update. But I was treated just as well as if I was a paying customer.

I bought my car from this dealership as well and that was a pleasant and speedy experience also.

Everyone here seems happy and contented with their jobs No grumpy bears here. 

Thanks for excellent service.

64,"December 26, 2018",TOYOTA OF ESCONDIDO has by far the best Sales reps you can possibly as for. I have purchased 6 vehicles personally from him. Three other family members have as well and he has never put us in a situation where it does not work for us. He works really hard to get us the best deals and makes himself available at our convenience which is wonderful. Will and Badillo are your guys to go on your test drives they are knowledgable about the vehicles and make sure that you are set up before you drive off the lot. It is never a dull moment. Moving over to the Finance department Jose and Ramon are amazing when it comes to adding the extra warranty or services while keeping your payment where you need it. Remember to ask for Dom and his team and you will not regret it and let them know Michelle sent you. I will never go anywhere else to buy another vehicle when i am there they all make me feel like I am the most Important person at that moment. All the little things count. That is what makes my experience truly exceptional.,5.0

68,"November 14, 2018","Ohh let me count the ways how horrible this dealership is.  I would say they are the worst I've ever experienced.   First, when you buy a car here, they will not honor a sales price that was advertised and even verified by a call to a salesman before going there.   I wish that I had read all of their horrible reviews first before buying a car from them.   Unfortunately I  ended up buying a ""certified"" used car that was less than a year old.  The first day I had it I noticed wires hanging down under the dash.  At the first oil change, I asked that it be fixed.  They also promised a wash. 
Got the car back unwashed and wires still hanging down.  Still didn't fix it.  I was then told that I needed to buy new tires since the rear tires are worn out.  The car is less than 2 years old now and I had only driven 8K miles. Only 24K on the car total and now I have to buy new tires???  I asked them to help me with tires and they of course said no ""what do you expect from a used car""  I told them I expected a dealership ""certified"" used car to be able to go more than 8K miles without replacing tires.  They told me the car had the minimum amount of tire life for safety when it was sold.  Nothing they can do.  So much for customer service.  So for all of you out there worrying about if this is a shady dealership, the answer is yes.  I am writing this to make sure you don't have to go through the terrible sales and service that I went through with them......",1.0
69,"November 07, 2018",Patrick Kelly gave me excellent service. I told him about my coupon and he made sure I got credit for it.

86,"September 14, 2018","On 9/12/18, I emailed the sales rep asking if he would price match a car from another dealership.  This was his response: ""That sounds like something we can do just bring me a copy of the quote or contract and I'll honor that price.""  I contacted him over phone and let him know I am out of town, but my family member can go to the dealership to verify the car and price.  After my family member did so, I spoke with the sales rep on the phone and he again confirmed that the price.  I agreed to the price and submitted my $500 deposit.  The dealership agreed to mail me the necessary paperwork, and that I would send the money via check.  The next day on 9/13/18, another sales rep contacts me and attempts to send me a verification for the car at a higher price.  She then tells me that the dealership cannot honor the price that they agreed upon yesterday.  I told them I already accepted their offer by giving them my deposit.

I got a call that morning, on my way to the dealership, from Santiago Garcia saying that Luis was out but that he, Santiago, would take care of the meeting. 
At the meeting I was told that the dealership was unable to do this sort of transaction! I was told that they could not take any form of payment, all they could do would be to help me finance the purchase of the car. 
I was instructed to go on line, was given all the particulars, and that this is how I needed to purchase the car.
After creating an on line account I discovered that no - I could not complete this transaction on line. After numerous phone calls and long hold times, I finally found someone in Iowa who was able to help me with this.

When we then asked to speak to either a sales manager or general manager we were told that there was five of each? That seemed extremely odd however we asked one more time to speak to somebody who could actually answer the questions that we had with confidence that they were right and truthful answers to what we were asking for this became more than they could handle Only person that seem to have any knowledge was one salesman however he couldn’t get the management people to give us just straight answers about what we could get on a Toyota Tacoma we’re not even talking price we’re talking about what features are available.  We thought we would try our luck at another store we went to another dealership and the eggs were extremely helpful however the vehicle that we were looking for was at Toyota of Escondido  so we then tried to call them and asked for sales manager of the general manager this provoked new bad behavior    They then decided that we just simply were not people they wanted to do business with even though we had spoken to them in a professional manner never using any profanity or anything other than asking direct questions and thank you and please day from that point on would send this to a system that said that they weren’t open every single time we called we finally gave up and after we gave up they then repeatedly called us and told us not to call them when I explain to them that we had certainly moved on and would be purchasing a vehicle someplace else and that we were not calling them then they proceeded to use profanity and scream at us we have many of these phone calls recorded The suppose it sales manager who was calling to scream at us told me to write his name down as I don’t care he wouldn’t give me his name so I can’t select the name on the system as to who it was that was calling and screaming at us although I believe it was two different people I hate to point out the name of the sales person who actually was kind considerate and knowledgeable I don’t want to get him into trouble this dealership obviously has some extremely bad work practices and employees,1.0

195,"January 05, 2018"," This is the worst dealership I have ever worked with, I have owned many cars  with with the majority of them being at car dealers. Last year I had three brand new vehicles only in my name, with perfect credit and secured the best rates possible.   One of these cars was the exact same model with the same exact options and I went from 2.9 percent financing to over double digits.   I have perfect credit and have never missed payments on anything, they stated that that is the best that Toyota has to offer. What a bunch of sheisters. I made an appointment coming from San Diego to ensure that I would not be waiting around any longer than necessay    Not only was the appraiser not available at the time schedule as I was early, but they could not find a car and turned into a 2.5 hour event   The salesman were absolutely terrible and not reviewing the options on the car or warranty.  They were in a hurry to get home and only hook up my Bluetooth. Also when delivered to me there was a dent on the front of the hood. Dealing with the GM  of 33 years was no picnic, they will just smile at you and BS you that there are I other options.  I took a huge bath on a car that I purchased two months ago and his statement was that the dealership has to make money also. And to even  further my claims, please take a look at the 574 comments on yelp with the majority of them having terrible customer service, sales,etc. This is no way to treat a customer that was in there six months ago purchasing the same exact car.   I have been a professional and business for over 30 years and have never seen anything as bad as this, if I would've read the reviews before I absolutely would not have given them my business   They stay in business by taking advantage of the consumer, please do not be one of them !!!!!!!! Buyer beware are the two best words.  Please do yourself a favor and go to any of the other Toyota dealerships in San Diego   Not only to not be taken advantage of, but also for better customer service. It is amazing that this dealership is in business! ",1.3

261,"August 31, 2017","My wife and I headed into the location with our 5 week old son. Our mission: to trade in my 2013 Prius C 3 for a vehicle that is family friendly.

When we initially entered the location you felt comfortable. The AC kept the place cool on this very hot day. We easily located the Sales Associates area.

We first meet with Juan Zaragoza.

To start we explained the situation with the Prius to Juan and he understood exactly where our needs were in handling the old lease and getting into a used car on loan. He had us use the database to check on what vehicles were available and then lineup what ones we wanted to try.

Assisting in getting our test drive vehicles setup was Rigoberto Rojas. Rigoberto went on 4 laps with us in 2 separate vehicles, allowing myself and my wife to get a good feeling of our selections. Also during these times I was allowed to install our rear facing child seat to make sure the vehicles had the desired room we needed.

Juan Barajas was there to get our paper work handled and did a fantastic job as we juggled baby and pens.

Our experience for the day of doing car installs, testing, price negotiation, and ultimately purchase took about 4 hours. But this was not the end of our events.

Rigoberto was quick to contact us that we had forgotten our house keys with the old car.

The next morning we found that the new car was having notifications on the tire pressure, which we would attribute to these incredible temperature swings.

We came back over to Toyota Escondido where the got the tires resolved and even topped off the tank because of the drive.

275,"August 04, 2017","I worked with Juan for my Toyota Camry Hybrid, He worked with me to stay in budget and was very informative and professional. Note: on most cars the dealership gives you 1 year free for maintenance (oil changes, car issues, etc) and with a warranty. Car dealerships can be stressful, because you want the best deal without getting ripped off. Toyota of Escondido tries to make the best deal for the customer. They would rather have a happy returning (my wife got a car from there last year and still talks about the deal she got) customer than a customer who was ripped off by the dealership. I did a lot of research for my pricing point and they actually came under. Thank you. ",4.8
276,"August 03, 2017","I sold my car on Saturday around noon. 
Went online and found toyota Escondido had the best deals for 2016 certified Camry's. I emailed and got a response from Juan Zaragoza. 
I told him I had a price in mind And he said we were close.
So I got down to the dealership around 7pm, Juan showed me the Camry's.
I had already told him my price range and he didn't try to upsell me into a new or more expensive car.
He wasn't pushy and answered all my questions. 
When I chose my camry and started paperwork he asked only once about the extended warranty and about the extra alarm that most dealers push you to buy. I declined and that was it, he didn't mention it anymore, which most sales person do. 
I paid for the car cash and when all paperwork was done I mentioned to Juan the car had no floor mats. i didn't ask for some and Juan said he'll get me some once parts department opens up next day, he didn't have to do that but he did.
He even offered to drop them off at my house but i picked them up at his house which was much closer to me than having to drive down to dealership again. He was off the clock when I got the mats from his house and still gave me great customer service and asked if I had any questions about the car.

287,"July 07, 2017","Just purchased a new Prius 2. 

The car is great, but I'm reviewing the dealership not the car. 

The experience was good enough that I downloaded Yelp so I could leave a review. 

Rosendo Perez was the first guy I talked to 4th of July morning. He quickly got a good idea of my financial position and determined the features I found important in a car ( safety and fuel efficiency in case you were wondering ).

Instead of getting me into less car for more ( which is my usual experience ) Rosendo had the same goals as me. He basically made it his mission to make me a happy customer ( and it worked...xxx, right ? ). 

I ended up closing my deal the next day with Perrin Um another great experience. The deal was done and all told ( including vehicle delivery ) I spent about 4 hours over both days. Rosendo finished out the deal by delivering the car, having me inspect it and going over all the new features and such. So I got to drive out of their without feeling like a completely overwhelmed idiot. Was a very nice touch. 

I've had experience with the service department also ( good ) so I'm looking forward to that too.

I have been servicing my FJ Cruiser Trail Teams from Day 1 at Toyota of Escondido. I actually had my first service appointment set for another Toyota dealer closer to my home, but their customer service prior to my appointment was miserable, which prompted me to cancel my appointment and go to Escondido. I had to buy my FJ out of state, as there were only a few Trail Teams Editions when I was in the market, but Toyota of Escondido treated me like I bought the car from their dealer. ALL of the service agents have helped me over time, and are all great, but Mozie Alcorn has been taking care of me like a pro. All of Mozie's help is very appreciated.
Mozie introduced me to Domenico Giannolo when I was interested in buying a 4Runner TRDPRO, which are super hard to get a hold of. Domenico completely took care of me, and I'm driving and enjoying my new TRD PRO 4Runner today because of his work to get me in my Vehicle. Of course when I hit my 1st service appointment scheduled visit, I will be going to Toyota of Escondido.

305,"May 16, 2017","I want to make it very clear that I am not reacting irrationally and I have given Escondido Toyota every opportunity to make my experience right over several weeks. I think it's important to let other consumers know what is going on at this dealership. At best, they are dishonest. And at worst, they are trained and directed to steal from their customers. To make a very long story short, I was tasked with helping one of my employees purchase a new 2017 4runner. She has excellent income, good credit and had up to 15k cash down payment. This should have been the easiest deal this sales team had ever come across.

Instead, they attempted to absolutely rob this girl blind. Lorenzo, who is the assistant sales manager can only be described as a total xxxxxxx. It's guys like him that give care salesmen bad names. He qouted this girl almost a $900 monthly payment on a 35k loan. When I asked him to break down the costs for me, he refused. I asked him for the rate? He refused. I asked him for the amount financed. He refused. In short, he couldn't describe to me why the payment was so high because he simply didn't want to. This dealership is totally predatory. They feed on people who have no knowledge of math or who will not question them on their shady numbers. Eventually, after refusing to actually answer my questions, outside of their scripted 3 lines they are taught to say to defuse a customers questions, he simply walked out of the room and said he was done. 

I was shocked to see such a large dealership for such a large manufacturer act in this manner. In other words, if they couldn't rip me off, they'd rather just not sell me a car. I spoke to the GM, and while he seemed like he was going to be helpful, he didn't really put in the effort to help me or fix the situation. The problem with this dealership is the culture they are breeding there. It runs all the way down from the owner/GM to the sales managers, to the finance managers down to the sales people. 

Lorenzo in particular is a total xxxxxxx, who wouldn't even look me in the eye because he was lying to blatantly. We decided to go to Carlsbad Toyota and she was driving her new 4runner within an hour or two. Carlsbad did not have the car she wanted but they were able to get one from a nearby dealer within about an hour. I'd like to show you the details and differences of the two deals below:

Escondido:
Trade in value: $1500
Payment: $859.00 per month
Amount Financed: Who knows
Rate: never could find out, but my calculator was spitting out about 20%
Time taken: about 7 hours in 3 trips

Carlsbad:
Trade in Value: $2700
Payment: $500.35
Amount Financed:$30,265
Rate: 5.90
Time: about 2 hours

Summary: Anyone who buys a car from this dealership should have their head examined. They are crooks. They are breeding a culture of dishonesty that runs so deep, they would need to clean out their entire sales and management staff and wait a few years before they can clean off the stink that is attached to them. This group of misfits have no business representing a fins company like Toyota, one in which my father in law worked for almost 20 years. It's obvious that management reads these reviews but has absolutely no plans on changing the culture there. Hey Lorenzo, I'm sure I'll see you at some Job Fair soon because with an attitude like yours, not only will you soon be unemployed, but your chances of success in ANY industry are nill. Thank you Carlsbad Toyota for treating my employee with the respect and dignity she deserves. Not only will I never recommend this Escondido dealership to anyone I know, I will go out of my way to make sure nobody I know every buys a car or gets service from this wasteland.

331,"November 09, 2016","Let me preface this by saying that I work near Toyota Carlsbad. The service center there is theoretically more convenient...but I had an awful experience and decided to try Escondido this time.

I did have to wait about 15 minutes after my appointment time before I actually spoke to anyone (which is why this is not a 5-star review), but this is still an improvement over the endless line in Carlsbad (by the way, Escondido has separate lines for appointments and drop-ins, whereas Carlsbad doesn't).

Jose was friendly, helpful, and understanding about my having other appointments and work. I was in and out in 86 minutes...and when I picked up my car, it was sparkling clean! (Don't bother asking for a car wash in Carlsbad...if they even bother to do it, there will still be visible dirt on your car.)

I'll be taking my car here from now on.",4.8
332,"November 08, 2016","My name is Aldo, 
Am 21. And My experience with Juan is an experience in which am glad to share with anyone who may think they can't qualify for a car or even afford it. 
Juan has been someone special to our family in which has helped my grandfather, my dad , and me 
The first time I met Juan he received me with a warm welcome and told me ""am going to help you as best as I can "". The first time I applied, I wasn't approved for a car loan. Honestly I was discouraged but he said""this is where I start helping"" he gave me tips and explained the reason why I wasn't accepted. As the weeks went on Juan would check up on me and from his part would encourage me not to give up. The process took 2 months and he called me one morning saying ""why don't we check again to see where you are "" so I went that day and after a couple minutes Juan came in happily and said ""Aldo your approved "". That day I felt like we had both accomplished a big challange. He gave me different options according to my budget. Juan is the man you need to go to, if a used car go to Juan , if it's a new car, go to Juan ,or even if you feel like everyone has closed the doors on you,go to Juan. Maybe he won't have the key to the door you want to open. But one thing for sure is,he won't leave you alone, he will be there next to your side until you find it. 
I have plans on getting a bigger car later in the years, and someone has already said to me "" Aldo, am going to help you as best as i can ""
Thank you Juan for your great help. I couldn't have done it without you 

My name is Aldo and thanks to Juan Zaragoza I am part of the Toyota family.

The 4Runner is awesome, but the sales staff and finance department are dishonest and untrustworthy (or one might say liars and crooks).  The sales man and the assistant sales manager sold us down the river with our trade (the lies started here with the trade), and the finance department packed our contract with additional items that we were led to believe were mandatory (unlawful in California).  We wanted GAP insurance from another source, but the finance troll told us we had to have it in ""their"" contract.  They have a new system where you sit 4 feet away from a computer screen and are expected to read the contract, then sign off on an etch a sketch pad.  He refused to print out the contact so we could read it first.  Next the salesman was a real actor!  He decorated his office with religious artifacts and testimonial notes to make it look as if we were dealing with an honest family man.  Nonsense...he never fully disclosed the ""deal"" details after we put our cash downpayment down.  Everything was hidden, no transparency at this place.  So they packed our contract by an additional $2,600 in items that were not necessary at all.  The sad reality is that this was our 3rd purchase from this dealership!  You think they would treat loyal customers with honesty and respect.  They must be under new management since we never were treated with respect or honesty.  They have lost us as customers, and we will not service our vehicles there either.  Buyer beware...at Toyota of Escondido.

418,"March 17, 2016","I'm not the type of person that writes reviews and I try to be very comprehensive and positive at all times but my experience at this place so far has been a headache. So much to say about this dealership, first off my salesperson was great I think the employees that work here are great but the management and whoever runs this place do a horrible job. The quality of the used cars they sale here is horrible and the cars are overpriced and could easily be compare to many dealerships around North County. I recently bought a used corolla, since I am first time buyer I wanted to start off with something not to expensive. They sold it to me 1,000 dollars more than what is worth. 3 days later some paint started falling out and I noticed that it had dings all over the vehicle. I noticed that other dealerships had the same car and about the same miles for a much reasonable price, There service center is horrible they take an eternity to get things done, for a simple change of battery it took them 3 hours! The service center representatives said it would only take an hour, before that I went to get my headlights polish and it took them 5 hours! They desperately need someone to manage that place better.I'm just trying to say is that try as many dealerships as you can around the area before making a decision. There are plenty of vehicles out there, Toyota of Escondido aren't the only ones that sale cars. I made a mistake from buying a car here but I learned my lesson. ",2.2

Next my Van was delivered to the Service department on a AAA tow truck. I was told the tow truck could not drive in and that it had to go back into traffic, go around the block and bring the car in from some back street. To the left of the service department they added grass instead of letting the tow truck turn left and go to the back from the front of the service department. Poor design! The tow truck took 20 or so minutes going back into traffic, going to all the stop light and finally finding the back of the service department building. They charged me $240 dollars for 2 hours of labor. I'm sure they rounded up. they charged me $131 dollars for a (part #15767-31020) pipe that was about a foot long. And last they charged 10 more dollars for two gaskets. This is all my error for going to the dealer. I just made them think it is ok to over charge the public. As far as the work completed.

Spent 5 hours on the phone with several dealers in NV, only to have 2 trucks sold out from under us. Everyone said, ""avoid buying in CA"". Yes, CA sales tax is 1% higher than UT, but DOC fees are capped at $80 by CA State law. vs $300ish in UT and $495 for NV dealers. For that price purchase, about 23 k MSRP, it was a wash for us. 

I sent Don Abadie, Fleet & Internet Sales Manager of Toyota of Escondido, an email, and he responded immediately with a request to talk. Five minute conversation, and it was done! The car; the deal; the out-the-door price. No deposit demanded - just like doing  business the old way.

My wife and son flew down, and I worried they would be taken advantage of, having flown in and rental car, etc., and deal would change. But, no; just as discussed-no dealer add-ons discovered, etc.

I agreed to the service but later was told the extra $70 on top of the oil change was merely to inspect the air filters.  When I explained that I was told by another employee the filters were replaced, the service rep basically called me a liar and told me what her fellow rep said ""verbatim"", even though she was not there at the time of drop off.  I also paid $25 for a tire repair.  They inspected and called to tell me the tire had several nails in it.  I told them to please repair and I would gladly pay the $25.  The next week I brought the same car back for a service recall and was told the same tire had a leak because of a nail.  I informed the rep that they should repair for free as I already paid for it to be repaired the week before.  He said he would have a tech look at it and get back to me right away.  After waiting 2 hours and without looking at the tire, he told me according to the service record I had declined the tire repair.  These are my only experiences with the service department.

464,"November 03, 2014","TRISHA AND LUIS!!!!!!
  Wow!!!! we had the worst luck in the world with cars, we bought a tacoma from mission valley almost 2 years ago. That truck was an impulse buy because we needed it so badly at the time and had nothing close to good credit. The sales team in mission valley vs ESCONDIDO was like night and day! For the last year we have kept the tacoma because we thought it was bettering our credit to one day have a truck we loved!!! We were so wrong!!! we had a 28% interest rate and over the last 2 years had only paid off 3000 toward the truck and it had made us completely upside-down with the creditors!!! I thought there was no hope and we were stuck paying our lives away to a truck we didn't even like!! We tried to refinance with two different banks and were denied! 

UNTIL.... We took the tacoma in to be serviced and got the phone call we have been waiting for, for over a year and a half!!!! Trisha called my husband and said we want to buy back your truck and put you in something newer with a lower interest rate! (could this be true??)  My husband had work all day and so i agreed to just go down there to pick their brains and see the options they offered us! Trisha new my husband wanted a Toyota Tacoma that we could use to tow his toys. Being the more realistic thinker i told her that wasn't 100% necessary but i would like to see what she has to show me. 
She found us a brand new RED tacoma that was awesome, seemed like everything we wanted. she was offering a TWO PERCENT interest rate!!!! I called my husband and he was grateful but i could tell in his voice he really didn't want a red car.  I wasn't as concerned about the color, i was just so excited to not be upside-down in the loan anymore. I asked her if any chance she could find me a different color.  Trisha worked her magic and found me A BLACK one!! Our dream car, it had so many more features and just felt right during the test drive!!! One problem, it was a little bit more expensive and she wasn't sure she could get me the same amazing deal as she did on the red one. i was trying to stay under a certain amount monthly, and wanted to keep the 2% interest rate!!!  

  Trisha looked at me like i was crazy but all that did was motivate her to do it!!! She didn't just pick up the phone and tell them what i wanted, she marched over to the financing office and said she wasn't taking no for an answer. She based her decision on our history with toyota, we had never missed a payment in 2 years (Even though our credit was not the best) which gave her a sense of trust in us! Next step was waiting...... we are expecting our second baby and by this time i had been here for hours, Trisha looked at me and said, you must be starving. Instead of having me wait, wondering in the lobby for hours, she kept me in her office, sent someone to buy us lunch, ate our lunch and chatted while she finished some of her other work. Man, this woman can multitask!!! By this time the phone rang!!!! I saw her face light up! SHE DID IT! (I KNEW SHE WOULD) We were approved for the BLACK tundra with the same low interest rate for only 20 dollars more a month... which might i add was still almost 100 less then we have been paying for the tacoma from mission valley that we hated! Now my husband had his dream truck and my favorite part, we were saving money!!!! 

  In conclusion, i will never EVER buy another car without speaking to Trisha first! She is so smart and genuine and GORGEOUS too!!!!!! Never once did i feel she was trying to put me in something just to make money or was pressuring me to make another bad choice!!!  She showed me every single option i had and had me in her office the ENTIRE day!!! 10-5pm! We left sooooo happy and even pranked my husband by making him think he was getting the red one and surprised him with the black!!!

 BEST SALES EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE!!!! wish i knew everyones names but TRISH AND LUIS are a great team as well as her boss and the FINANCE team!!! We WILL BE BACK!!!!!

Lee worked late to accommodate my schedule, and even gave me rides to and from home (local), as I had no car, but also to allow my sis to see my new car and get her approval!!

His supervisor, Gonzalo Cantu, played the classic ""bad cop"" to Lee's ""good cop"" well!  I loved it!  He also offered what I consider a good deal:  $160 a mo. for 5 and a half years, very much doable!

I may have payed too much ($20k on a 2014 corolla after $10k down), but I got a great financing plan and had an awesome customer experience with Lee, so I am totally satisfied!",4.8

467,"August 14, 2014","I have been going to this dealership for regular oil changes and other accessory items for my 2005 Prius since the beginning of the year. My recent trip last week to this dealer cost me $38 for the oil change and a missing Tactical knife from my center console. I understand that they are not responsible for items left in the car but REALLY, do you need to take my things from me? When I called the Service manager and explained the situation to him, he responded with ""OK"".  Pretty much nothing to assist with the issue like ""he apologizes for my stolen item"" or anything to that effect.  He told me that he would contact the other service manager and ask his team if they saw the item.  The director of service contacted me and said that none of his technician saw or took the item from my car. Of course your team would deny that they would take anything from anybody!! I'm sure that they would not want to lose their jobs!! I am not satisfied with this place of business, now I have finally experienced the term that everyone uses ""Stealer-ship"".   I will NOT be coming back to a dealership that cannot be trusted.

468,"July 24, 2014","We just made a purchase at Toyota Escondido on a new Camry.  The car can sell itself, but what made it even better was the custome service and the deal we made.  Our saleman Chris Marino really jumped through hoops to get us an unbelivable price and the lowest rate.  We were 100% happy with each; the price, the rate, and the customer service.  It's refreshing to find a good deal from a great place.
Thank you again for all your help Chris!  
We'd Highly recomend this dealership to anyone.  I'd ask for Chris for the same experience that we had.  We will be returning to buy the next one from Chris.

484,"February 16, 2014","What can I say?  Kevin Edgett is the man, the myth, the legend.  I worked with him at Toyota Carlsbad as well on previous purchases.  After this weekends fiasco, it makes sense why he is part of the Toyota Escondido family.  Toyota of Escondido doesn't play games, they give you the bare bones best price if you do your homework and research.  Kevin Edgett works in the interenet fleets and sales dept, so there is no haggle whatsoever.  I contacted Kevin Edgett first and then Toyota Carlsbad.  My trip to Carlsbad was not pleasant (see review) so I did what I thought best, I contacted Kevin Edgett and he said to just come in and get a car.  

Kevin Edgett got my family and I the best price possible.  He didn't bull me with inflated prices for extras.  I told him what I wanted and he provided the lowest, dirty price.  That was an example to me of his honesty and simple committment to provide the best service possible.  Kevin Edgett had everything ready to go before I even entered and set foot on the dealership property.  He walked me in the back to his office and I was in and out with 1-2 hours, driving a brand new Toyota home.

I would like to thank him for his passion, honesty, and down to earth attitude.  He can relate to customers and not give the typical sales pitch you get when you walk into most dealerships.  Toyota of Escondido is a better dealership for this reason.  The employee base is more of a family then just workers clocking in and clocking out.  They take care of you until you are happy and work with you within reason.

Thanks Kevin Edgett for the pleasant and easy no hassle experience...again...for the third time.  Remind me not to go to Carslbad again!  You guys ROCK.",5.0

However, I received a call, email and text from Jose Martinez regarding a truck that he found that they could work a deal with us within our financial requirements.

We are very disappointed and displeased with the customer service.  There is no follow through or follow up with the sales representative.

There's a reason that we keep going back to Barry and Toyota Escondido - they're friendly, knowledgeable and fair.  The post sale follow-up is fantastic and I'm not referring to the contact you have immediately following the sale (which they're good at too).  When I say they're knowledgeable this isn't limited to their product knowledge, they take the time to find out about you and the things that affect your vehicle use and they make recommendations that make sense and satisfy the needs of the buyer.  Pricing has always been fair and reasonable.  I do a lot of research before making any substantial purchase and I don't believe that I could find a better overall value anywhere else.

I have recommended Toyota Escondido and Barry Murray many times to family, friends and co-workers.  By way of this review I make the same recommendation to those I don't know.

497,"May 31, 2013","I am still very surprised at what happened at the Scion dealer today.  My son and I are in the market for a new car.  We have narrowed it down to FR-S, BRZ, Focus ST and GTI.  We live in Escondido and had previously bought a 4Runner at Toyota of Escondido.  We visited the dealership and went through several salespeople before we found one who was ""certified"" to sell Scions.  Finally we got a salesman we talked about a white base model on the lot.  The salesman said he needed to run a credit check before we could test drive, and he would need to find another salesman because although he was ""certified"" to sell, he was not allowed to test drive a Scion, only a Toyota (don't ask me).

We went in and he proceeded to ask me a lot of questions, as if I was buying the car.  Home addresses, work addresses, monthly salary, SSN.  It was fairly intrusive for a test drive but to humor my son I played along hoping we were nearing the end.  But then he asked for 3 references who did not live at my address.  Are you KIDDING ME?  Skip tracing references for a test drive?  At that moment I politely said we were done at that dealership.  I can't imagine stepping foot in there again.

We immediately went to Heller Ford and test drove a Focus ST with just a Xerox of our drivers licenses and then to Mossy VW where we drove a GTI with, you guessed it, only a Xerox of our license again.  It's off to the Subaru dealer tomorrow to drive a BRZ.",1.0
498,"May 25, 2013","We thought a 2013 Avalon Hybrid with the Touring or Limited package would be the right car for us. After a nice test drive with a nice young salesman, we were lured into a typical endurance contest with a couple levels of sales management above the young man who took us on our test drive. We were only there for the test drive, did not have the Matrix with us that we intended to trade, and we had a limited amount of time available. We made this clear to Warren and Robert, and they acknowledged our situation, yet they came on to us with a line about ""if we can make you an incredible deal today will you buy the car?"" So sure, we agreed we probably would, if the deal was unbelievable. From that point forward the tag team of sales reps was obnoxious at best. Offered a coke, brought us a 7-up... what was that about? Made us a commitment for a car that they would have in the showroom the following day, took a $500 deposit from us, then claimed an inability to get the car there, but requested that we bring our Matrix in and they would loan us a Camry for the weekend. Now I know they could have sent somebody to Irvine for the Avalon and brought it down for us. And I know that they could have made a decision about the trade-in value of the Matrix within an hour or two of my handing it over to them. And I know that I would have bought a car from them if they were ""good"" instead of ""bad."" But they were totally manipulative and uncooperative and unwilling to negotiate in a straight-forward manner, so I rate them BAD. A few days later I traded my Matrix for a new Avalon Hybrid with Touring package at Toyota Carlsbad. The terms and conditions were no different from those I was trying to nail down at Toyota Escondido. The sales team at Carlsbad was willing to work with me instead of BS me.  ",2.0

In the time I have owned this car I've had 15 oil/filter changes, of which 10 resulted in a moderate to severe overfill (as much as 1/3 quart), even though there is a clear note on the service tickets to ensure that the level is at or slightly below the full mark.  The usual attitude of the advisor when this is brought up is ""It's not a problem, you can go over the full mark"" (Owners manual disagrees).  I've had numerous conversations with the service manager (Darrell) about this and always get a promise that he'll have a talk with his staff and this won't happen again (2 out of 3 visits overfilled, epic fail).  The impression he left me with is ""Hey, if you don't like the service here, go elsewhere, I don't really care"".

518,"November 20, 2012","Came in looking to possibly buy my fiance an early wedding gift. I was initially greeted by David Mota and he was friendly, helpful and professional. He had me bring in my fiances old truck to get the appraisal value. When I returned he was busy with another customer, but he nicely redirected me to Hector Aguirre who was available. 

Hector was very pleasant and easy to work with; couldn't of asked for a better sales associate. I didn't have to go back and forth too much for my ""magic"" number and I was VERY happy about that. I briefly met Carlos during the price negotiation period and he was very nice and funny. During the whole process I was not talked down to nor treated like I didn't know what I was doing like I have experienced at other dealerships (because I'm a young woman). When the process was 75% done, I called my finance to the dealership to surprise him with his new gift. The Escondido team was able to find and get the exact truck he wanted that night!!

In financing we had the pleasure of working with Mir. The service Mir provided us was OUTSTANDING. Very friendly, knowledgeable, and gave us some good tips/offers regarding my financing options. Mir was very clear at explaining the pile of paper work that comes with buying a new car. I felt completely at ease and trusted Mir 100%.  

The whole experience was amazing and I look forward too doing business with this team again. I will also highly recommended this team & dealership to anyone I know looking for a new car. Thank you Hector, Carlos and Mir for a great experience and helping me get the perfect gift for my fiance...he is VERY happy  :)",5.0

520,"October 16, 2012","I bought my very first new car at Toyota of Escondido at age 33. I was a little concerned at first not knowing the inns and outs of the process and figuring that I needed to make sure I read through everything carefully dotted my i's and crossed my t's. But internet sales manager Scott Busby put my concerns and fears at ease. He was a true gentleman and of course knew the entire sales process not to mention the car I bought very well which was comforting. He was not a high pressure salesman like I figured I may get but someone who was concerned to make sure I knew the important aspects of the car and available options for my benefit, not to make a commission. In fact, after I already bought the car, Scott made sure I was aware of another discount that was only available that day through a 3rd party provider that he only just became aware of as it was a day of promotion. He did not need to do this as I already bought the car! But he wanted to ensure I was a happy car buyer. The process was very smooth. In fact I literally just had to sign my name. Everywhere where an address was required or some other detail, was populated by the dealership. The entire process was a breeze from the initial contact with Scott through their website and via personal (not automated) emails to agreeing to buy the car to the finance department where I worked with Mir to get a loan on the balance that I did not put down. In fact Mir worked hard to ensure I got the best available rate (even outside of Toyota) due to my very high fico score. He did not need to do this but again was looking to do what was in the best interest of the customer not his own pocket book. I am sure this good will from Scott and Mir will be returned many times over in business. I also enjoyed chatting with Mir about finance and world politics, although briefly. :) I am very happy with my new Prius and I am very happy with the entire car buying experience at Toyota of Escondido.

I have a 2005 Camry that I purchased at Kearny Mesa, which is pretty far for me, but my next Toyota will be purchased at the dealership in Escondido.  Ronnie took my friend and I for a test drive and was very responsive to all of our questions and concerns.

Kevin explained all about Toyota Care and information about the Toyota.  We also visited the gentleman who was the money guy, who was very kind and thorough.

The dealer didn't have the color and options I wanted on hand, but they found it with 24 hours. I got what I consider a great deal. I did my homework and was prepared to take a ""hardline' with the negotiations. Wasn't necessary. I was shown the MSRP and then Scott gave me a number. The number was so close to my number that there was nothing left but to agree to it (probably could have wasted some time dickering around for a couple of hundred but didn't see the need). I'd definitely buy from this group again.

Word of mouth took me to T of E and I was a little sceptical pulling into the lot. This due to a prior experiance we had at the other Toyota dealer closer to the coast. I had done my research and was ready to pull the trigger on the purchase of a Black 2012 Tacoma acc. cab SR5, if the price was in line with my research and ready to walk if the Customer service wasn't up to my standards. 
I didn't want to deal with mediocre service through out the life of my truck and starting at the sales floor would not have been a good sign. I was first met by a great guy named Barry Murphy who was awesome, professional, and straight up trustworthy, but had a family member fall ill during the process of locating the right vehicle for me.
Enter Scott Busby. We liked him right away and his ""whatever it takes to get you into the truck that is perfect for you, and I'll personally make sure that you are satisfied every step of the way"" attitude. This man delivers!
I've owned two Toyotas prior to this and have had great experiances through out the life of them, but I have never had an EXCEPTIONAL EXPERIANCE like I've had with Scott, including his after the sale follow up calls to make sure that I was nothing less than excited about my new truck.
No gimics, no surprises just ""over the top exceptional customer service"".
I've been singing his praises ever since I drove off the lot with my new truck and will always reccomend anyone looking for a white glove experiance purchasing a new vehicle to see Scott and his awesome team at Toyota of Escondido.

We knew that we wanted a Prius, and that we were dead even on the Carlsbad and Escondido as each were 7 miles from our home. We made one call to each of the Internet Sales Service Lines and immediately Scott set himself apart from his competition. He kept his focus on what we wanted, told us about some top level features, and said he would have our two favorite colors waiting for us at the front door.  Sure enough, both vehicles were parked right out front. He walked us through all of the safety, quality, and engineering features and assured us that their price would be the best available.  We sat down at the computer, and literally 30 minutes later we were in finance with Vern. I do my homework, and these guys were prepared to make deals. 

Vern(finance) also knew the car's features thoroughly, and was able to discuss the warranty specifics, GAP pluses, and the standard options handled at this phase. These guys even spent additional time ensuring we were in the appropriate tax scenario given some cities have out lying areas that have different tax rates.  All of this was done with our best interest first with no pressure, and what I felt to be one of the most heartburn free experiences.

I highly recommend these guys even if your on the fence about a purchase.  If you know what you want, then call Scott, and ask for Vern. Although we did not interact much with the rest of the staff, all of the Sales Members were considerate and approachable as we watched them interact with the incoming customer base.

My husband drove his car also so that we could leave my car there.  The day before they told me that they would need to inspect the doors and then order the parts.  When we got there they told us it would cost us $105 to inspect it and if it wasn't the right thing wrong we would be stuck with doors that don't work and a $105 bill.  I asked why they didn't tell me when I set up the appointment.  The lady said, ""Who did you talk to?  Did you just talk to the receptionist or did you ask for the service department?""  Really?

So, I told them to just change the air filter and was  led to believe that it was the cabin air filter as Megan told me. An hour later it was done and they asked me if I wanted to set up an appointment for the brakes, so I said ""yes, pls go ahead and schedule me for next week""

While driving home, I noticed that the remote for my newly installed after market Pioneer head unit was MISSING! since I had another appointment with them I just decided to bring it to their attention the next time I went there. So, I did go there today and told Kristina while I was checking in with her that the remote was missing and nobody told me that my car was loosing oil too. If I didn't read the receipt I wouldn't even find out.

They changed the brakes of my car and when it was time to pick it up. Kristina then directed me to the manager. After telling Darrell of the circumstances he said that there is nothing that he could do and he will not replace the missing remote which was 4 days old when I brought the car. It is is unfair! What protection do customers have from people who would take things from your car while it is being serviced?

I would not recommend this dealership to my friends. I also had a bad experience shopping for a car here which is why I bought mine from Kearny Mesa.

Toyota of Escondido sold  us a used car for the price of a new one. they did not give us a discount.  they even said that our down payment was only going to be 800 dollars when in reality it was 2500 or more, i don't remember because they got money from our trade In's gap and warranty that was not used. we usually get a check when we trade in a car for the gap and warranty that was not used. this time we didn't because Toyota of Escondido took it without letting us know and used it for our down payment in addition to the 800 dollars we gave them. we were clients for 7 years,, we purchased 5 different cars from them and recommended a lot of clients.. we trusted them but they ripped us off. we will not go back to Toyota of Escondido. and will not be recommending anyone.  my family and i talked to the general manager and he did nothing about it.he was rude.

550,"January 05, 2012","I went into the dealership to have my oil changed the day before Christmas Eve. On New Years Day morning, nine days later, I noticed my heater was not blowing hot air, which I did not know at the time indicated my coolant could be low. Later the same day, I was on my way home from work and my check engine light came on. My car started running badly and my engine started making knocking noises. I pulled over and noticed there was no coolant in my vehicle.  When I pulled the oil dip stick out smoke was emitting from the engine. Needless to say my car was out of commission and I was stuck on the side of the road. I later checked the code causing the check engine light and it stated it was a cooling system failure.
 
The next day I called the service department at Toyota of Escondido and spoke with the service manager. I told him what had happened and explained I was just in for an oil change a week earlier. All the fluids in my car were supposedly checked and filled. They also checked for leaks in my cooling system. I know my car did not have any leaks because I am pretty aware of things like that. The service manager told me to bring the car in so they could do a diagnostic, free of charge. After the service technician looked at my car the service manager called me and told me they were not going to take any responsibility for the problem and told me the problem came from my head gasket blowing and sucking up all the coolant causing the engine to overheat.

How can that happen if my coolant was already low, which was indicated by the heater not blowing hot air earlier in the morning?  When I asked the service manager questions he could not answer he said he would speak with a technician and get back to me. He later informed me my engine head was separated from my block and the coolant was possibly leaking out the back.  Again...I would know if there was a leak from my vehicle but apparently I'm not a technician so my opinion does not matter. I was later told by a friend that a blown head gasket could be the cause the separation.

The million dollar question was where all my coolant went if it was just filled and I had no leaks. Plus, I had no coolant before my head gasket blew. The dealership said they could take apart the engine to find out what exactly happened but I would be charged anywhere from $500-$1000 to do so. They could not say they did not cause the problem but they wanted to charge me to figure it out.  How does that work? As far as I was concerned they should still be investigating the cause of the problem and determine why there was no coolant in my vehicle.  

Needless to say they could not prove their innocence and I could not prove they were at fault but I’m stuck with the $4500 bill to fix my car. Hmm...leaves me to wonder if my coolant actually got filled in the first place. My thoughts...probably not.  

What great service...Thank you Toyota of Escondido you can guarantee you will not receive any further business from me or anyone I know. Happy New Year!!

551,"December 09, 2011","I am extremely disappointed with the service I received yesterday.  Upon arrival, I asked if they would take a $19.95 oil change coupon from another Toyota dealer in town upon which the fine print was pointed to which states that the coupon was to be used with a punch card for discounts.  I did not have one, however, I'm pretty sure the punch card is something that would be handed to a first time user customer.  (upon paying for my oil change, the punch cards were stacked for the taking next to the cashier's register).  I was then told that they could do my oil change for $24.99.  When I started the ignition so he could register the mileage, the serviceman (finally) noticed I had a Lexus and tried to charge me $35.99 for the oil change.  Oil is oil so I balked and I was given the $24.99 price.  That day, I was scheduled to trade my car in for a 2012 Lexus.  At the Lexus dealership, the service manager inspected my car to verify its trade-in value.  The service manager came to me and informed me that there was a fresh rat's nest on top of my battery and to be aware that rats can potentially cause thousands if not tens of thousands of dollars of damage to the electrical system and hoses, etc. under the hood.  My question is...wouldn't you think that the Toyota mechanic that serviced my car would have at least alerted me of the nest and potential for extensive damage, let alone, remove the nest when he opened the hood to refill my fluid levels and check the oil dipstick?  As I drove away upon completion of service I noticed that my &quot;oil maintenance&quot; indicator light was not even turned off.  Honestly, I am wondering if Toyota of Escondido really performed the oil change, or if they just charged me the money and did not service my car at all.  BUYER BEWARE.",1.0
552,"December 02, 2011","I knew going in that a passenger side visor, even though a simple &quot;cheap&quot; part, would run me close to 100.00. But, seriously, Jennifer first quotes me at over 160.00 - after I question this she says, oh, that includes installation but they can knock off 10% of the price to help me out. Help me out?  Installation? It's 2 screws and a screwdriver.  

I can just imagine the service people laughing their heads off at the expense of a customer as they screw in two screws to install a visor for over 60.00. 

Of course I told her I could probably handle the &quot;installation&quot; myself - and, no, I don't need an oil change on top of that.  

As I go to purchase the 100.00 piece of plastic (a visor that shouldn't have stopped staying in the up position on a 3-year-old truck and apparently just went out of warranty.. riiight..) the parts cashier doesn't give me a 10% discount so I have to remind him. It still totals over 100.00 for this simple plastic part but at least I didn't let them get me for the 60.00 to &quot;install&quot; it..  

I mean, really, how is a customer supposed to walk away feeling good about a transaction where a service manager so obviously tries to rip them off - you can’t tell me she didn’t know the job entailed a screwdriver and two screws and that she couldn’t suggest I “install” this simple part myself.

555,"September 20, 2011","High pressure sales department is not fair in their negotiations and their customer service is terrible.  Went to purchase a used prius and left after experiencing the worst customer service I have ever received anywhere.  The salesman had the nerve to call me a few days later to ask if I had reconsidered their offer.  The salesman doesn't know how to negotiate and uses the typical sales tactics.  They want to talk about payments instead of the actual price of the car and price of the trade-in.  I specifically asked to negotiate price and not payment three times before he finally got it.  We were about $3k in difference in what i was willing to pay and the salesman wasted 2 hours of my time going back and forth to his manager.  Each time he came back, total of 4 back and forth, he offered $100-200 more on trade-in and $200 less on an overpriced prius.  Once I got up to leave someone came out of the sales office to try to persuade me.  He was nice but at that point it was too late.",1.0
556,"August 31, 2011","Despite the previous negative reviews for this dealership on this site AND a family member who had a bad experience with this dealership, I initiated contact on 8/27/11 with this dealer. I contacted them through the Costco auto buying program for used vehicles because their website listed several certified used vehicles of the make/model I was searching for. 

I received a call within 10 minutes from Barry, and we discussed the specific make/model I was interested in. Barry told me that the Costco program would provide me a discount off the lowest published price. We discussed specifically that this discount would be taken off the ""Internet Special"" prices as listed on the website that day.

When I arrived, Barry welcomed me to the dealer and introduced me as a Costco buyer to Antonio Sanchez to handle my questions and possible purchase. After inspecting the vehicle and taking a test drive, we sat down to discuss the price. I raised a couple concerns about the condition of the vehicle, specifically that there were missing accessories (floor mats, cargo mat and tonneau cover), one of which was specifically listed on the website as being installed on the vehicle, and that the tires seemed excessively worn for a vehicle with only 15,000 miles on it.

Antonio went to ""speak with his manager"" about the price and returned with a write up for the car at the Internet special price, and told me it was a firm price because ""they were only making $100"" at that price. I immediately pointed out that his price did not include the Costco discount I had been told about. I was then told that the Costco discount would not apply to the Internet Price, it would only apply to the original and much higher price.

At that point, we together reviewed the dealer website where I pointed out the tonneau cover that was on the listing for this specific vehicle was missing. I was told that it was merely an option, despite it being listed under ""Installed Options and Accessories."" We also reviewed the CarFax report which showed that the dealer had mounted and installed tires, and I asked him to explain why the current tires were so worn for a vehicle with such low mileage. The response I got was that the price was still firm, and that the dealer was unwilling to negotiate at all, or even honor the previously quoted Costco discount. 

Despite this, I made a counteroffer on the vehicle. Antonio not only refused to consider this offer, but refused to bring it the attention of his manager, so I decided to leave. As I was driving away, Antonio chased me down in the parking lot, suddenly able to offer the Costco discount but unwilling to consider any other negotiations. I declined to pursue further discussions about any vehicle.

Essentially, I felt I couldn't trust the dealership anymore when it took me actually driving out of the lot for them to honor the offer they had made to me on the phone. The dealer seemed to think that giving me the Costco discount was a big concession and doing me a favor, instead of that being the staring point of negotiations because it was the pricing they had already committed to.

Guess it's still ""business as usual"" at Toyota of Escondido, and they've lost another potential customer.",2.5
557,"August 29, 2011","HI I recently went to Toyota Of Escondido for a used car, I felt has everything was going good until a mager came out to appraise my car. At this time i heard his salesmen make a remark about my wifes chest, and instead of reprimanding him he laughed wih him and then stared at my wifes boobs in a derogatory way. This was very displeasing to me and very untasteful. This was just the beginning of my bad experience at Toyota Of Escondido. The mager John then drove my car around the lot, and offered me a riducolus price for my trade in. I went to Toyota Of Carlsbad and they offered me $2500 more for my trade in then he did. Not only was his offer ridiculous, I found his behavior with his salesmen towards my wife very rude, and un-professional. You can rest assure I will make sure I will let all my friends know to not buy a car from Toyota Of Escondido, and theres not a more rude dealership out there. What happen to proffesionalism, and being curteous to people that bring you buisness. Well don't count on that from Toyota of Escondido, and espically they're manger John.",1.0
558,"August 26, 2011","As Murphy's law has it, my extended Warranty expired April 2011 on my 2005 Tacoma, in which was paid off at the same time. I purchased my Truck from Toyota of Escondido, and have had all services performed there. So with that said, it was a surprise that the little man in a seat with a big red ball appeared on the dash. Unknowing to me, that is the AIR BAG Man, he appears when there is something wrong. I immediately called Toyota of Escondido, and asked for assistance, and I cannot say THANK YOU enough for the outstanding service Toyota of Escondido provided me! Not only do I always have great customer service, I was also blessed with assistance on the part to be replaced. I would like to acknowledge whom I feel went out of their way for me, my trusty Service Manager Jennifer Baray. Jennifer has been my regular Service Manager for some years now, and I wouldn’t want it any other way. I hope that others within Toyota of Escondido can look to her as a model of great excellence for her Customer Service skills, she is AWESOME!!! I would also like to acknowledge Michelle Lynch, what a pleasant person to deal with, she was assuring, thanked me for being a customer, and assured me that Toyota of Escondido would see what they could do to assist me with my repair, and she followed through! My Truck was repaired, and I had my normal full service done. Now don't get me wrong, the little man in a seat with a big red ball was cute, but I am sure glad he is not showing anymore. Thank you Toyota for making this happen, and making sure I am always treated with respect, and I am assured that my vehicle & I will continue the great relationship we have developed, it’s a family now!! People who care about us are always doing little random acts of kindness for our benefit, and Toyota showed that to me!",5.0
559,"July 13, 2011","Brought my vehicle in here recently for service and was ripped off. Fifty dollars labor and a two hour wait to install a battery! Yeah, I know, I should have shopped around and installed it myself.

The service advisor, a female, was indifferent to my needs and seemed only interested in inflating the bill. The cashier gave me no greeting when I went to pay and didn't even look at me. Members of my family and I have come here for years to both buy vehicles and get them serviced, but no more. The quality of people they have working here has dropped off considerably. In all fairness, I will say that some of the people here are of good quality and are customer service oriented. In the future I will take my business elsewhere and I recommend all others do the same.

560,"April 18, 2011","I went to look at FJ Crusiers on 4/16/11.  The salesman, Steve, showed us one.  We asked to test drive it but he said they weren't giving test drives because of gas prices and it was their busy time of day.  He wouldn't even let us drive around the parking lot.  He said we had to come back 3 days later.  Then he got a call that he said he had to take and he needed to lock the car up.  We watched him just go and stand next to the front door.  We went to Toyota Carlsbad and bought the same FJ Crusier.  Another couple at Carlsbad said they also had a bad experience at Escondido and then went to Carlsbad.  I will never go back to Toyota Escondido.",1.0
561,"March 27, 2011","Bought a truck, took it home then noticed that it had been repaired and was not told of this before i bought it. Went back to try and get a discount or another one and they wanted to buy it back from me but for alot less then what I paid. I think they should take it back without me loosing any money because if they had told me about the prior damage I would have not purchased the truck. I have boughten 3 cars from Toyota and will not buy anymore when i am in need of one. Toyota of escondido do not care of customer satisfaction and are dishonest. I will give Toyota of Escondido very bad rating anywhere I can and will not recommend it as a good auto dealer. ",1.8

I was able to come in and walk out with a new set of keys within minutes! Thank you, Lauren, for bending over backwards for me!",5.0

I feel the best thing for me was there was no pressure. For me this was a big deal I have owned my car for 13 years and Lauren was patient. I think the price of this car is very fair and I am very happy with it I love my new TC.. I just want to say thanks again Lauren.

564,"February 13, 2011","Toyota Escondido gets a '5' rating for all categories because the entire process was smooth, respectful, and genuine. Our sales person, Lauren Collins of Scion, was fantastic, authentic, and answered our many questions. With Scion, there is no haggling, which my and wife and I were relieved to learn. Our financing terms were very fair and matched what we thought would be fair given our credit scores. Overall, I would recommend Toyota Escondido to my friends and family and especially would recommend Lauren Collins. We will definitely be buying our family's future cars from this dealership because of her! :)",5.0
565,"August 11, 2010","Jessica logged me for my 12-month service.  She was most pleasant.  Although I was a bit late for my appointment and on a short time before a following appointment, she conducted herself pleasantly, patiently and effectively.

I met Julio while was seated in the customer waiting room.  I was watching him pretty closely while he used what I considered to be a fairly elaborate coffee machine.  He sensed my presence, asked me if he could explain the machine and showed me just how it worked.  Again, as an employee contact, he was very pleasant and a favorable representative of the agency.

As a past employer of a great many people, I rated these folks as top flight agency representatives reflective of the standards set by the agency owner and his employment of people who meet these standards.",5.0
