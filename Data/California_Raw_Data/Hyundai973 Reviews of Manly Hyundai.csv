I will never do business again with another dealership, they understood what I needed, what I wanted and we achieved that. My sales person Jesse was amazing and so was my friend Julie.

13,"February 13, 2020","I have owned a total of 20 cars from different dealerships.  The way it's supposed to work is that you call the service department, someone answers the phone and you make an appointment.  Simple.  At Manly Hyundai, no one answers the phone.  You have to leave a voicemail and, hopefully, someone will call you back.  That doesn't always happen.  When I complained about this process, I was given a direct line to call to make an appointment. That was supposed to make things better.  Sometimes I have to call a second time and, again, leave a message.
I have been told that Hyundai is Manly's stepchild and I know from personal experience with the 4 Hondas we have purchased from Manly that the service at the Honda section is far superior to that of the Hyundai section.  
I am not going to name names, but I would do so confidentially.
I will think long and hard about buying another Hyundai from Manly.",2.8

This was the best experience I have had finding a new car with their excellent Sales Person; David Iodence, and the genuine concern and attention from Josh and Sean in the estimate and financial areas. What a Team of great people to help me drive away feeling safe in a new vehicle and delighted with the whole experience. They even squeezed me in to the Service area when a light went off unexpectedly - incredible custom service from everyone I encountered at Manly Hyundai.

41,"September 23, 2019","I had a pretty good experience purchasing a used car from Manly Hyundai. I drove from Sacramento to check out a Toyota Highlander, called ahead and let them know I was on the way of course. Through email, texts, and phone calls, I was in contact with Gustavo the entire time. He was very professional and accommodating knowing im coming from 2+ hours away, he made sure the vehicle was available and ready to take for a drive once I got there. Im pretty knowledgeable about cars, do my own work and maintenance, and know what something is worth and how much work it would need to make it showroom condition. They had a Highlander that was already priced pretty fairly considering condition of the vehicle and mileage. I check it out in person, took it for a drive and noticed it needed a few minor cosmetic or maintenance things to make it perfect. I made them an offer based on what i thought the car was worth in its current condition and they accepted and I purchased the vehicle from them. The SUV runs great, in the 2 months I've owned it I've driven it to Vegas and back and then down to So-Cal and back without any issues at all. It runs great and I truly feel like I got a good deal. Gustavo was a great sales rep and it was awesome to work with him. Their finance manager Edgar was cool too and took care of the paperwork of the car for us. He did try really hard to sell their warranty services but I just didn't feel like it was worth the price, but I dont really hold that against him because I know theres a pretty penny in it for them for each warranty package they sell also. Its just part of doing business, which is what a car dealer is. Its a business and they have to make their money too. As for the vehicles they sell, just like every other dealer out there you must understand one thing..The sales guys and gals aren't all auto enthusiasts and not all of them know the ins and outs of all the vehicles they sell. If you're buying a used car make sure you get an independent PPI done at a reputable shop so you don't end up with a piece of crap with 4 tires and a steering wheel or check the car out thoroughly if you know what to look for. Overall it was a pleasant experience for us and I recommend talking to Gustavo if you plan to look at a car at this dealer.",5.0
42,"September 21, 2019","Top notch dealership from sales to finance. They made our out of town purchase easy.
No hassles! No pressure! Everything was waiting for us when we arrived.",5.0
43,"September 18, 2019","After a horrible experience at another dealership, I was more than thrilled to work with Eric Brito at Hyundai.  He was polite, no pressure, went out of his way to be accommodating, and stayed after closing to finish the transaction. I would not hesitate a second to send anyone looking to purchase a vehicle to this young man.  ",5.0
44,"September 13, 2019","I have now had two amazing experiences at this particular dealership. I would reccomend this dealership to anyone. I really can't say enough good things about my experience, but I'll do my best!
I had an unfortunate accident about three months ago in which I was rear-ended. This totaled my car, and I had never been in this position before. I'm a younger car buyer. I also work full time and am the mother of a toddler, so finding the time to go through such a process is difficult. However, this dealership made the entire process incredibly easy. I actually found a car I was interested on the internet and reached out about it. Almost instantly, I was sent a text message (from a real person- Gustavo Rico!) with live video of the car on their lot. I made an appointment to come THAT evening. I did go that evening, quite close to close at that (I work full time, but the entire dealership was polite and happy to help, despite me ending my transaction well past closing time). Gustavo was incredibly helpful throughout the entire process, explained everything easily and really put my family at ease. I could not say enough good things about Gustavo, really (he's the reason we came back, which I'll get to in a moment). Then we could tell the finance department was bending over backwards to find me the best deal, and were really working to ensure we left comfortable and happy. Just a great experience. I had only bought one car prior from a local credit union dealership, and honestly the difference was night and day. By the end of that evening, I had the PERFECT CAR.
Which is why it was SO SAD that less than sixty days later- my vehicle was hit by a drunk driver. This put me and my family's world into a tail-spin. Insurance was less than helpful, and my whole situation was a nightmare. Furthering the issues, my job necessitates a car. The rental group (not Manly of course) gave me a car with all sorts of issues. I was overloaded and miserable, and this was putting my family through a lot of stress.
I reached out to Manly Hyundai again, seeing if they might be able to help. I had the absolute joy of getting to work with Sean in finance. I really cannot say enough good things about everyone at this dealership, but Sean literally became like a part of my family during this experience. He let me vent to him. He did research on how to help with various other issues surrounding getting a new vehicle (calling the bank who was leasing the vehicle to work with them on the loan while I processed gap insurance), helped me work with my insurance company and helped me to understand the entire process, the list goes on and on. He had Gustavo reach out to me (which he did almost immediately) to set up a time to see what they could do to help. I set up a time to come in, and I did.
The thing that impressed me MOST about Sean however, during each of my visits) is he was 100% transparent about EVERYTHING. They could have sold me a car THAT day, but he wanted to ensure that he could get me a good rate and ensure everything was taken care of with the bank. I am so incredibly grateful, I can't even explain. He did have me go home that night to sort it all out, but called me within the next 48 hours to give me information he had researched on my particular visit and had me come back.
Gustavo started helping me when I came back but was needed somewhere else, and he had Eric help me. Before passing, however, he gave Eric the complete details on my situation to ensure the transition was seamless. Both him and Eric were so incredibly helpful. They helped me look at quite a few different vehicles with my preferred features in my price range. They answered a variety of questions (and I had a lot, because at this point with my insurance I had been THROUGH IT). I ended up having trouble deciding between two cars.
That's when Josh came into the picture (general manager). He let me know that there'd be a bit of a wait with getting the financial aspects together, but he let me know he had heard about my situation and that at that point they were determined to get everything taken care of for me. He let me borrow one of the vehicles I was looking at, so they could process everything and I could make a confident decisison.
Which was so cool in itself. BUT THEN, I changed my mind on the car. I called the next day and politely expressed my reasoning and asked if I could make a switch. They moved the car I wanted, put my name on it and held it until my scheduled appointment! I was floored by the level of customer service and just compassion for my situation. I can't even explain how grateful I am. I came that day, went through an easy finance process with Sean (who continued to just be amazing and go over everything until I was 100% comfortable with my decision), and I walked out that day with my next, perfect car.
I honestly can't think of a better retail experience I've ever had. And buying a car is an involved, stressful experience. This dealership really put my mind at ease and has made a huge difference for my family. I don't think I'd ever come anywhere but here, and will reccomend this place to anyone who will listen haha.
I wish I could do more, because these people all have made such an incredible impact during such a horrible situation.
Huge HUGE thank yous to Gustavo Rico, Eric, Nathan, Sean and Josh for really just helping me get my life back together. I can't thank you all enough.",5.0
45,"September 12, 2019","I drove more than 150 miles to test drive a new Genesis G70 in the configuration that I was not able to test drive locally.  Nate Hyman, the sales consultant, went out of his way to accommodate me with several test drives of different configured G70's.  I thank him for that.  He gave his input on the different drives the two vehicles yielded and encouraged me to go home and think about what to do.  No pressure sales at all, actually the opposite.  I said I hate to make the drive back again.  He said no problem we will deliver the vehicle to you if you decide to purchase one.  

I went home, thought about the G70 I wanted, called him up, negotiated a great price and voila the car was delivered by Benny (a super nice guy) and paperwork signed at home.  A very painless experience overall from test drive to delivery, to transactional explanations.  No question I would make the drive again to ask for Nate Hyman and purchase a vehicle from this dealership. ",5.0
46,"September 10, 2019","I've purchased multiple vehicles from this dealer for a reason, and when it came time for my son to buy a new car, I knew exactly where to send him. Everyone, from Nate in management, David, and Eric (Erik?) in sales, and Sean in Finance were awesome. Friendly and service-oriented, and when I say my son and I were treated like family, I mean it! What an exceptional experience!",5.0
47,"September 01, 2019","Because of the great sales experience our friends had when they purchased their 2019 Santa Fe, we took their advice and made an appointment with Erik Epting.  Erik was with another customer at the time and asked if Nate could help us.  That started a truly great educational experience on both the Santa Fe as well as the Tucson.  Nate worked with us until Erik was free, driving with us and giving us the pluses of the car.  He answered our many questions and was really a great representative of your dealership. When Erik was available, he took over and waked with us through out the rest of the purchase, helping us decide on the right car for us.  He was detailed, articulate, caring, friendly, open, and a delight to work with.  After we decided on the Santa Fe, Erik introduced us to your finance Manager Edgar.  He demonstrated the same friendliness and professionalism as Nate and Erik.
After a complete walk around and interior review of the features, we drove off the dealership lot completely satisfied with our purchase.  As retired professionals, we so appreciated how we were treated and feel we made good friends with Nate, Erik and Edgar.  Pay them more!!!!💰
We’ll tell everyone of our great car buying experience at Manly Hyundai.",5.0
48,"August 18, 2019",I had a really great experience and I’d recommend my friends and family to go here as well. Our initial rep was unavailable and Aaron stepped right on in to assist and made it a wonderful experience. ,4.8
49,"August 13, 2019",I'm so happy I found Nate from Manly Hyundai. I was debating between leasing and financing. Nate made sure I understood everything between the two and compared them both. I decided to finance and got to walk away with my brand new car!! I would highly recommend this company to anyone!! ,5.0
50,"August 12, 2019","My wife and I just purchased a new Hyundai Palisade Sunday the 11th of August. We never expected the experience we received. Upon our arrival at the Dealership we were promptly and happily greeted by  Sean within less than a minute he guided us to Erik who assisted us. We had just gone through a very difficult process earlier in the week in which someone had  ran into our 5 week new car and totaled it, We were not even up to speed with knowing what the outcome with our own insurance company was going to be but we knew we were going to need to start the process of obtaining another car, so we had test drove and spoke to dealer representatives all around town and a couple outside our area. We had not felt comfortable in making an agreement to purchase any car yet not being sure about the situation we found ourselves in, Erik and Sean provided us with so much information about options available to us with the accident we suffered and assisted us in learning about the vehicle we were interested in. We gamed several scenarios which allowed us to put a plan together to make a purchase that day. They helped us to get a loan at a far better rate than we expected on top of it all. From the outset both gentleman were sincere very knowledgeable and professional. They listened to what our circumstance was and what our need was and our goal was. When we made a decision to move forward the process was fast and efficient and informative. We left there very happy and satisfied, Customer service is what the car business really has become about and the gentleman I met at Manly Hyundai personified that in every way. A real five star experience

51,"August 01, 2019","Nate treated my wife & I very well! I found him to be genuine and respectful, no hard sell and very patient with us. Which I really appreciated. I have already given his card to a work colleague wo hesitation! Also, I found the finance guy just as great to work with. Same helpful, honest, low-key approach. Edgar Medina was his name. I would do business with this team any day again.

I bought a car here 15 years ago. I was very happy with how good the product was that I had to come back. I was sad that the car style was typical of other cars out there. I loved my Tiberon and will miss the look. I have 218000+ miles on her and realized I needed to get a car more efficient.",5.0

55,"June 25, 2019","I am a younger mother of a three year old... so I don’t have a huge amount of time to go car shopping. I was browsing online on various car purchase sites and kept seeing Manly Hyundai, and reached out online after I saw a car I wanted to check out. I got a text less than five minutes later from the awesome Gustavo. Not only was the response fast- he even included a video clearly from that moment of him showing the car! I responded that I was very interested, but basically had to come today due to my childcare situation. He made time for me THAT evening. You could say I was practically sold before I arrived. Then my husband and I met him. Gustavo was even more amazing in person! He was incredibly helpful, with a good sense of humor. He showed me the initial car, but also many within my budget (I have worked in big box retail management, and I was that customer that came like an hour before closing). Nonetheless, this didn’t seem to faze him one bit. After giving me some helpful input on some of the choices, I got an awesome Hyundai Elantra in great condition right within my price point. Gustavo was amazingly helpful from start to finish- answering every question fully but concisely so I felt comfortable with my purchase. Then, I was lucky to speak with Hasan in financing. Hasan was very kind and genuine. He was very up front about what to expect and tailored the discussion around my individual needs- working hard to get me the perfect arrangement. He explained everything completely and in a way that put me at ease (car buying is a nerve wracking thing, and I’ve never actually purchased a vehicle through a dealership). I left feeling confident in my purchase. To top it all off, I called the next day with the typical questions I SHOULD have asked initially- and Hasan was just as friendly and helpful. 

My husband and I will be back for our next vehicle, and I’d recommend this dealership in a heartbeat. ",5.0

60,"May 30, 2019","My family and I had the pleasure of having Hasan Ghadiri as our dealer. His many years of customer service is apparent by the way he handles himself and the warmness that comes from speaking with him. He made purchasing a car, which is usually tedious and dull, into an educational and humorous experience. He also gives you a lot of options to choose from. You won't find better deals anywhere else in the area! But, what I like the most is that he will not sugar coat anything and will tell you the facts. Whether you're set on purchasing a vehicle, or need help finding the best deal for yourself, I highly recommend you go to Manly Hyundai and find Hasan Ghadiri!",5.0

62,"May 19, 2019","Began shopping for my Elantra online. Noticed there were many options and offers to consider. It was important to me to shop locally and not chase down the lowest deal all over the State.

The experience was refreshing and left me with a new car that will serve my family well.

An aside, the music in the showroom is just awful both in volume and choice - is it really needed?",5.0
64,"May 04, 2019","We had never purchased from this dealer, nor purchased a Hundai before.  The showroom staff were polite, both on the phone and at the dealership.  My husband previewed the car a few days before I was able to see it, and raved about Joe Reid. He said he was very personable, honest, and extremely informative and helpful. I made an appointment to meet with Joe ASAP, and I was very confident with his knowledge of Hundai cars and his knowledge of this vehicle. He offered me a long test drive, and made sure I had as many experiences driving in different conditions as possible. I found Joe to be intelligent, polite and helpful. He was low-pressure and I did not feel at all pushed into buying a car.
I did buy the SUV I test-drove, as it was in great shape and was perfect for me! We will continue to buy from Joe Reid for any future car needs. GREAT experience. ",4.8

67,"April 18, 2019","My family has bought 7 cars from this dealership and the last 6 experiences have been positive, the 7th not! Rico, Curtis, Hasan and Edger very disappointing in follow up!
Rico, once the sale was made multiple requests regarding adding a feature to car
Curtis, although paying cash for the car wanted to pull a credit check?? Said it would be a ""soft pull"" was in fact a hard pull and reported on my credit report.
Hasan, makes a lot of promises and when I spoke to him yesterday stated ""I can't remember all of what is promised""
Edgar, assured me that when my car came in for Zurich (yesterday), they would look at the navigation screen that turns itself off and will only return with a reboot. Service department never notified, not done. Will take another appointment
This is a brand new 2019 car with 300 miles on it....

Once I selected my car there was a slight problem as the car was in the process of being sold to another customer, making it not available before telling me this. Your amazing Sales Managers Eric and Greg had already located and secured me a ""twin"" car I wanted .Then it was Edgars turn.

77,"November 17, 2018","A week ago I had gone on-line and requested quotes from various dealerships, not knowing exactly what I wanted but there were things that were important to me.  Saturday morning (at an appropriate time) Joe Reid called to find out how he could help me.  I told him what I was looking for in a vehicle and he had a couple of models in mind for me to check out, so I told him I would meet him.  Mind you I had a list of dealerships to visit and passed a couple on my way to meet with Joe, but I had made a commitment to meet him first.

The car I was currently driving was 18 years old and in good condition, but I was ready for something new!  My last experience with a dealership was about twelve years ago when my son was 16, and it was so horrible that I never wanted to go back.(That was in the east bay)

Joe Reid was so nice and explained everything so well, that to be honest....I didn't want to go anywhere else.  We went for a test drive in a model that suited my needs.  Not once did I feel pressured to purchase something more than I needed or to commit to something that I really couldn't afford.  Not for a moment did I feel uncomfortable, in fact every part of my buying experience went so well that I almost thought it too good to be true!!  With-in a few hours I drove away in my brand new Hyundai Kona right off the show room floor!!!  I love my new Kona and I would recommend Manly Hyundai to anyone whether they are buying their first car or their last.  I also want to thank Hasan in financing for being so nice and understanding when it came to making sure I knew all the warrantees available to me and what I could afford.
Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!!!

This was our first time on the Hyundai side, however and let me just say that we were very impressed with the whole process. You never know what to expect from salespeople, so my wife was a little apprehensive about that. But, Anthony is a very non-pressure salesman and didn't try to push anything on us, so we felt right at ease. Instead, he listened carefully to what our needs were and located the perfect vehicle for us. We already had a very good idea of what we wanted and never dreamed we could afford brand new. But, they were able to get the price so low that we could afford it!

""Hawaiian Mike"" is a really nice guy and put us right at ease in the Finance Dept. Even though we had to wait for quite some time to be seen, he was very apologetic and gave us our first oil change for free to compensate. He got us a great loan at an incredible rate as well as a very affordable warranty plan!

Salesmen Edgar and Alex were not only professional but also very genuine, honest and kind. They get a “thumbs up” in my book! They made my buying experience a breeze and I appreciated their expertise and ability to accomidate my needs as a used car buyer.

All of the team at Manly were fair and reasonable. The Sales Manager Arnold was helpful and able to accommodate my needs and make a deal within my price range, even going so far as to lower the price, replace the tires, and giving the car a full detailing.

Hasan was helpful and able to accommodate my financial needs to make the deal work within my price frame and helped me finance just enough to establish and repair my low credit score.  He went above and beyond my expectations.

The atmosphere at Manly was warm, welcoming, comfortable, and I didn't feel any pressure at all.

171,"May 08, 2018","Purchased a 2017 Santa Fe SE.
I recommend this dealership but be patient.
Had to go back and forth on price too many times and I was about to walk away, but I really believe in supporting and shopping the local Sonoma Strong businesses community, so I gave them one last ditch effort and walked back in...(plus I really did not feel up to driving two hours and starting over...) Buying a car shouldn't be this way and play games. I showed them matching prices for identical cars online in Fremont and Sacramento.  I gave it one last ditch effort and said I need the car to have a hitch... Include it in the price and you have a deal...

The employee who saved the deal was Tim in parts...He pulled everything together and walked it through (despite all the problems with their inter-department billing issues with DUE-BILLS)
The DUE BILL process was really bad. and needs improvement. But eventually it gets handled. 

Neil In finance was really efficient, but not sure why the sales wanted a credit app on a CASH deal. 
Arnold was great and helped with getting the two departments communicating.

But If it wasn't for Tim, who really understands customer service I'd be driving something else right now.

Thanks Tim for saving me a weekend and keeping it local!

We drove to the dealership and started looking around, all the dealers looked busy and we couldn't find the car so I told my girl let's go. That's when Edgar Medina came out of nowhere and asked if we needed any help. I said yes and showed him the car I found online. It was crazy because he said the car was sold but he showed me a text, and it was a lady saying she was bringing it back that day. So lucky and Edgar was the only one who knew at that time. So we came back in about an hour and there was our car. Edgar honored the online price, helped me find insurance, got me a second key fob, and floor mats. Plus he's gonna get me a full tank of gas.

Pat helped us tremendously and did not hesitate sending us to Manly Hyundai; even though it meant he would loose a sale. At Manly Hyundia  Kenia Romero was very helpful. What I appreciated about Kenia was her sunny disposition and willingness to be so accomadating. I changed my mind three seperate times and Kenia was incredibly understanding. We ended up with the exact car we wanted. Another plus for Kenia is that she doesn't hesitate to ask for help when needed without alienating the customer. 

We also had a pleasant experience with Hasan Ghardiri. Hasan was very knowledgeable and took the time to explain the warranty program to my husband without making he or I feel rushed. He wanted us to feel comfortable with whatever decision we made.

Erik Epting was also very responsive and extremely knowledgeable. He took the time to help us understand our car features (i.e. blue link, back up camera etc), even on his day off.

Lastly Edgar (sorry I don't know his last name) was incredibly helpful even though he wasn't our salesperson. I interrupted him twice (not realizing he was with a customer) to answer a few questions for me while Kenia was inside looking for another car for us.

Our Salesperson, Joe Reid, was fantastic. He listened to our needs, and recommended the perfect car. He located the color my wife wanted, and had the car ready for delivery when she was available to pick it up. Finally, he was able to pair her phone, and have her feel comfortable and happy by the time she left the dealership.  Our Sales Manager was Gary Lewis. He told Joe Reid about our budget and what we could afford, and Gary was able to write up a deal that we could afford. At another Bay Area Hyundai dealership we felt that they didn't care about our business. Gary introduced himself, and made us feel like we mattered. It seems like a small thing, but it made a difference to us.   Finally, Steve McKerracher was our Finance Manager. He helped us with the paperwork and found a great service agreement that fit into our budget as well. He was able to explain the things we didn't understand and walk us through everything one step at a time. My wife and I appreciated his patience and attention to detail.

240,"December 04, 2017","I walked on randomly to check out the Santa Fe and Curtis walked up to say hi. After a brief chat we decided to give one a spin and I loved it! I asked Curtis if they had anymore in my price range and he hooked me up with a 2017 pearl white beauty before it even hit the lot! The car is immaculate and exactly what I need to commute and be a productive musician. I just took it to my first practice today and it carried myself and my bass player with all of our equipment without missing a beat, and let me tell you two professional level rigs can be a lot, for us it adds nearly 400lbs and A LOT of cargo space. 
The process for buying was basically what I had expected and I really appreciate the staffs expertise in handling such a messy process because I would have been at a loss, I learned that you really need to lean on a lot of people to make this whole system work. I never really felt like I was being lied to or taken advantage of. I was a little skeptical when I couldn’t get the asking price of the vehicle lowered, but at the dealership kbb told me the price was right so I went with it, since I’ve checked out some more adds for the same car/model year and I’m pretty confident that the price was fair and they weren’t just lying about not having room to bring it down, so good on you guys for not being liars! 
Steve rocked at finance, god all that xxxx looked complicated. At a certain point I asked “what time do you guys close? I hope I’m not keeping you.” And he responded “oh we just go until it’s done, sometimes it’s early sometimes it’s later. It’s no big deal” 
Being a 20 year old dude pothead looking dude I definitely had some dealers send out their young guy “that’s like totally chill man” haha, but I’m definitely more of a grumpy woodworker type so I just wanted to be treated like a normal dude buying a car and that’s what I got at manly.

I actually wanna scream and run around but not a good idea since I live in an apartment! Lol I’ve not always heard the best about Hyundai’s, sonwas sckeptical. However, after learning about their rebate programs, my interest peaked. I decided to go check it out and see if owning a Hyundai would help my situation. Edgar greeted me as if we were long lost friends, and made me feel like I was visiting him in his home. I told him how I don’t drive many miles but needed extra space and more technology. My commute to work isn’t far but my boyfriend and I still enjoy going on adventures once a month. Edgar suggested checking out the Santa Fe and by going into a lease option, this gives me the opportunity to trade my vehicle every 3 yrs and get the most advanced technology. Yup.... he checked all the boxes!!! His sales manager, the guy with a funny accent, Neil I believe, put together payment options that would have been crazy to say no to! I’m seriously still in shock that I have an amazing beast of a vehicle parked outside!!! When it was my turn in finance, Steve explained everything so it was easy to understand. I truly felt in control the whole time and felt I was given the option to make informed decisions regarding warranties and protection products. I never once felt pressured when I was hesitant on whether or not to opt for the options... I did eventually say yes even though Steve was fine that I had originally said no. It just made sense. A few extra dollars a month to protect me from a few hundred at a moments notice. Anyway... in the end, Edgar showed me in more depth all the features of my new car. He paired my phone for me and helped me set up Hyundai Blue Link! Who doesn’t want to be able to start their car from inside their home?!?! The cold weather is here, I live on the 3rd floor and now I can have a warmed up vehicle before I even get in it! I can keep going on and on but I think I’ve rambled enough.

259,"November 09, 2017","Erik Epting is a schmuck. He was so incredibly rude to my mom and I. 

Curtis McMicheaux had been helping me out via email and test drove cars with us that day. We left to test out some more at other dealers but returned that evening to buy a car. Curtis was busy, so he said Erik would help us out. Erik just had a slimy aura about him but I gave him the benefit of the doubt. I had a discount offered by my insurance company, $2,000, and he looked it over and said he would honor it. Erik went and printed out the estimate and before he flipped it over he said"" I have a lot of numbers on this page, but don't worry, I'll explain them."" Ughh!!! Oh thank you wise man, our little lady brains can't handle numbers :( He went on to tell us about their financing offer which makes no sense and is a total scam. If you do shop here, do not take their higher interest financing offer to ""save money"". ""My wife just got a car and she went this route to save money"". Suuuure she did Erik, sure she did. Lying to me to create a sense of trust. Ew. 

As we reviewed the estimate we saw that he only applied $1500 discount. My mom said we wanted the whole discount, he insisted that this was a military discount and only the veteran is eligible for the full discount. This was incorrect. My mom told him that was false and that she has bought multiple cars and it was never an issue. He said he had been doing this for years an knew what he was talking about and when my mom responded he cut her off, ""Ma'am are you buying the car?"" His demeanor was just awful and with that I said ""She isn't and neither am I"" and we were out of there. I was shaking from that blast of negativity. He said other rude things that I've blocked out, but it was just the worst experience. (We were eligible for the full discount, Erik was thinking of another discount but instead of double checking he was very rude to us and insisted on not applying the full discount)

I've spent almost 16 years in customer service and am an exceedingly patient and happy person but this was ridiculous. 

I saw Curtis outside and told him we were leaving. Curtis is a sweetheart and he apologized profusely and went back inside to see what he could do. Came back with the full discount applied but we were still shaken up and it was almost closing so we said we'd return the next day. And then the next day was the start of the fires. 

Erik went full jerk over $500 and lost a $20,000 sale. Total schmuck.

*****************************************************
Due to the fires we were not able to get back in immediately and life was consumed with other matters. A month later Curtis emailed me to see if I had bought a car yet and if I was interested in some more 2016 models that had just arrived. My mom and I were able to make it in and check out the models.  Curtis made sure the experience went smoothly. He was not able to bring the price down significantly on the car so I feel like maybe I could have paid less for the car I have but I have a car and it is all settled now.  Steve walked over to meet with us and said we'd finish up the paperwork with him and Erik. I told him I would not be talking with Erik and Steve understood made it happen. without Erik. It bugs me that Erik made any money off my purchase, wish I could have cut him out of it. Still gives me the creeps.

Steve was very nice and approachable. He lamented that we had a bad experience the first time and urged me for feedback since Mr. Manly wants everyone to leave happy and have a good experience there.  He even offered me some medicine for the upset stomach he and I were both suffering from.  Overall good experience the 2nd time.  Could have been a classic play of good cop bad cop but it is what it is. Seems like they have some games and schemes here and take advantage of the lack of nearby competitors.

We emailed Manly Hyundai and got an instant response with a price that was better than we even hoped for. I said I will pick it up in the morning---all by email. Done deal! I arrived at 10:30AM and our daughters car was already detailed, full tank of gas, ready to go. Curtis greeted us at the door and handled everything start to finish. Clone him quick!",5.0
279,"October 06, 2017"," Service was great and it didn't take long to purchase.  I was acknowled within a couple minutes of getting out of vehicle by Joel Villicana.  He was very helpful, and knowledgeable.  He even called my insurance agency to switch over vehicle coverage and had proof of insurance printed for me.  When I had bought a vehicle in past I had to come back next day with proof of insurance.  He made it easy and non-stressful. 
 I also worked with Steve McKerracher-finance manager. He was very thorough in explaining options and getting me a fair price.  Even had examples of a manager's vehicle for comparison of the Zurich shield benefit.  He worked around my limitations on payments coming up with a fair price and still making it where I was able to get the options I needed.  Preferred how he didn't pressure me into options I didn't want.  Yet, explained and gave examples of their benefits so I would be able to make a more informed choice.  I would definitely come back here for my next vehicle and recommend to others.",5.0

I drive about 100 miles a day so having a good car is a must. I have horrible credit but am a hard working single mom and do the best I can . Curtis understood my needs and budget and helped me find the best deal under the circumstances. I honestly did not think I would be driving away with the deal he got me or any deal for that matter. The whole team was friendly and fast. My only complaint is that the car was a little dirty inside and out. They said it was detailed but it looked as though just the tires were sprayed and the car vacuumed. Minor detail but when they said they were detailing it I thought I was getting a new wash and clean on the car. More importantly though Curtis helped me get into something I don't have to worry about and he was extremely fast,friendly and professional.",4.8

I appreciate how he knew about the product he is selling and the patience of allowing us to test drive a few vehicles.  They were upfront with their price and tried their best to get me the best price and financing available.   Though we first looked at Honda and told the salesman we were going to look at Hyundai, he was professional to introduce us to Eric.  I like that Manly sells both since my experience with Honda has been very positive with service at Manly Honda.  The staff I have always found to be very upfront and honest at Manly and can say the same for the buying experience.  No pressure during the sales and Eric did an awesome job answering questions and his knowledge of the Hyundai.  Glad I got the car with the blind spot detection because the first week driving it on the highway, a truck with no headlights was beside me in my blind spot.  When I went to go into the lane, the detection went off warning me and sure enough, the truck and I would have had an accident.  In a way, I bought the car in the nick of time since my previous car did not have it. It is great that Hyundai offers this part of their basic package.  I am very pleased with my new Hyundai Hybrid...great on gas too!",4.8

Erik didn't pressure me but did asked me what was holding me from making the purchase and ask me very nicely if there was anything he could do to ease my decision to buy. I said not, and I am glad I did because I was test driving the basic version. When I came back I was sure I wanted the limited version and the color I wanted too.

One thing I would request from any sales person is never mention commission, as a consumer we know there is commission but when we are trying to get the great price we don't want to hear about commissions, that was my only glitch that did make me pull away for a bit.
Also the finance guy just spoke to fast for me and I started tuning him out Hasan Ghadiri I am sure he is a nice guy but it was late and I was taking my sons time, I felt he was very pushy on the extended warranty and did not totally answer my sons questions on exact coverage issue with my warranty and the extension. Maybe I was his last client, but for me it was very important business he even looked at his watch. If I decide I need extended warrant I will get a better rated one. I did not see great reviews online the Zurich plan you offer. The small pamphlet that maybe cost $1.00 if that was not impressive on what the plan does and I am very happy with my AAA towing plan, I been with them for years. I am a person who keeps my cars until they are 100,00 so a long while before I need a newer car again. I will recommend Erik to anyone I meet that is looking for a good person. I appreciate the GM's concerns when I did pull away for a bit, it made me feel he did care and Erik cared about helping me. So Thank you both very much I hope I have great results with my new car and if I ever have to come in for anything I hope it runs smoothly. Hasan made me worry about Hyundai's repairs, saying people come in with things wrong and they have to pay lots of money, not the thing to say when a person is buying a new car from your dealership and hoping even the service is great and any problems will be taken care of under my warranty of course. You asked and I told. One more thing being left alone for five minutes or more is not a bad thing it is a big process and sometimes we need a few minutes to regroup and my son and I had time to talk.",5.0

I have to add a negative note here however.  It took OVER TWO HOURS to get a finance officer to meet with us for the final paperwork to be processed.  For this reason, we nearly left.

487,"October 20, 2016","My journey to Manly Hyundai started early this summer at another Bay Area Hyundai dealership. I wandered in there one Sunday, interested in learning about the new Tuscon.  After taking it for a test drive, I really liked it and was serious about it but I was not in a hurry to replace my older Hyundai. I normally don't provide my contact info when car shopping but I reluctantly did so and was VERY clear with the salesman that I would call him when I was ready to move forward but I would not do so if he bugged me. He assured me he wouldn't. . .however, a couple weeks later he began calling me daily and leaving me voicemails. At least 15 of them.  This is when I turned my attention to Manly Hyundai.  I went in on a Saturday afternoon with my mom and was greeted by a salesman, David Hughes.  I was very clear, probably even a little rude after my last experience, that I was only looking. He was great - he backed off but stayed close enough so that when we had gathered our questions and were ready to test drive, he was there. We drove an Alantra as mom was also considering a new car and a Tuscon.  We weren't ready to make a commitment that day but I gave David my contact info, assured him that I would be back, if he didn't bug me.  He didn't. He touched base with me every couple of weeks to update me on  current discounts etc in a consultative, partnership type way. Not pushy. So three visits, 2 test drives,  one false start later (we were doing a trade in and that car was hit the day we were going to bring it in), we purchased the car. The process was so easy.  The negotiation was easy (I did my online research - there's so much info available) and Davd had previously committed to me that they would match any price - true to his word, they did.  Anyhow, I would recommend this dealership but especially Dave who made this such a great process.  It was refreshing to work with a salesman who listened to what I needed and also followed through. He also set up a service appointment for me for my other Hyundai and on another visit assisted me with getting a screw removed from my tire. Thank you.  ",5.0
488,"October 18, 2016",I will admit that this was my first new car purchase so I do not have anything to compare to.

Curtis met me and my daughter as soon as we came to Manly Hyundai and his friendliness and warmth made us feel very comfortable in what we were expecting to be a stressful situation. I was there to exchange our current lease for a 2013 Elantra for a 2016 Sonata. Curtis was friendly, positive, very knowledgeable, patient (it was my daughter's first ""car buying"" experience) and gave her some options that would work in terms of her budget.  He followed up with us promptly, found the exact car she dreamed of, and left an extremely happy customer. I am a Hyundai customer for life just because of the service I've received on my third Hyundai lease.
Manly Hyundai is very fortunate to have someone of Curtis's caliber and I've already referred several people to lease or buy a Hyundai. It was probably the least stressful car experience I've had. He is invaluable and if i could click ""tens"" all the way across, I would! Marya and Janneke Byrne",4.8

Erik greeted me and my daughter and was extremely friendly. I didn’t see anything on the lot that interested me so he took us to the larger lot. I was interested in a couple Jeeps but let him know I had errands to do and would meet him later around 1:00pm. In the meantime the “other” Salesperson from Hansel would not stop txting and calling me even after I told him I would let him know when I would be there. He even had another person call me which set me off a bit. I decided I did not need to be harassed by a sales person from Hansel so I went shopping.  Came back around 1:00pm and Erik came to the lot right away. I ended up really liking the Honda Crosstour. Erik was extremely patient with me to test drive other cars and was never pushy and was able to answer all my questions.  Believe me I am not an easy person to deal with and Erik did a great job putting up with me. I also dealt with Hasan for my financing and he was friendly, knowledgeable and I didn't leave with that ""I got ripped off feeling"" .

506,"October 03, 2016","I was told that my car was ready on Friday, September 30th in the afternoon. When I arrived to pick up the car at 6pm, I was then told the service department ran out of time and was not able to clean my car that day. I would also like to add that I was told this was I was handed the keys.

 I find this extremely unprofessional because I was told the car was ready hours prior to my arrival. My sales rep told me I could bring the car back in next week to have it cleaned. After I drove off and further inspected the car, I contacted him immediately and told him I wanted the car cleaned as soon as possible and that I was disappointed in the condition of the interior. Even after reaching out to my sales rep, I was not given a confirmed time to return to have the car cleaned. I reached out again on Monday and was told to bring the car in to be detailed. 

Fast forward to today, Monday October 3rd. I brought my car in to be detailed and the car was returned to me in the exact same condition I dropped it off as. Let me repeat that for clarity. My car was returned to me in the exact same condition I dropped it off as. The car wasn't even vacuumed and nothing was wiped down. The cup holders were dirty and the seat belt buckles have a sticky substance on them. I wish I could attach photos because my car is in an unacceptable condition. I immediately told my sales rep that the car had not been cleaned and he responded very rudely and told me I was wrong. He refused to view the dirty vehicle and told me I could bring it back on Thursday. 

Resolution: After returning home with a dirty vehicle, I contacted a manager over the phone and was told to bring my car back in the same day (Monday, October 3rd). I was given a rental for the night and told my car would be cleaned in the morning. I picked up the car today (Tuesday, October 4th) and it was very clean. I spoke with a manager who was very kind and understanding of the situation. He gave me a one free oil change for the inconvenience. 

Overall, I feel that my time was disrespected here. It's hard to resolve an issue such as this because I have missed 4 days of work due to the condition of that car. I work for Uber full time so I either needed to pay out of pocket or wait for the car to be detailed. Receiving a clean car is not a perk of this inconvenience, it is simply the standard in which I should have received the car in. 

10/19/16: I wanted to update my review to include another side of my experience. My car has broken down twice within the first three weeks of purchase. On the 12th day of owning this vehicle, I brought the car into Hyundai to be inspected because the car wasn't shifting correctly and could not reach high speeds. I was told it was covered under my Nissan warranty and Manly's Hyundai was not responsible. I was forced to then drive this unsafe car to the dealership and denied a rental car for the inconvenience. A week later and my car is back at the Nissan dealership for another repair that Manly's didn't catch on the inspection. I find it suspicious that these things would be overlooked during an inspection and unacceptable that Manly's has provided me with no further assistant on a vehicle I purchased from them less than 30 days ago. I would never recommend buying a used car from this place. It's quite apparent that once you sign the papers for your vehicle, Manly's no longer cares for the customer experience. I have witnessed this through them expecting me to take a dirty vehicle after purchase and the refusal to assist in car repairs that happened within the first two weeks of purchase.

He showed me the vehicle that I had already chosen right away and did not try to steer me in another direction, I did not end up getting the car that I had liked online but it was only because I saw the same vehicle in a different color that was more suitable to my tastes. No pressure, no false promises. The finance manager David Sambad got me the most amazing loan and did not give me the usual run around that one usually gets from  car dealership. I was in and out of Many Hyundai with the vehicle of my choosing and left feeling respected and cared for in a way that does not normally happen in these situations.

647,"March 11, 2016","My husband and I couldn't have been more pleased (actually thrilled) throughout the ""entire"" process in purchasing our new Tucson. 
We have been customers of Manly for two decades now and have always been pleased with their service department.  They have kept our cars running safely and dependable throughout the years.  We wanted to continue to keep our business with Manly because of its capable and friendly staff, who make us feel heard and important.  
As my husband needed to focus upon his new and very busy professional practice, I took over doing the due diligence on cars.  With the expense of cars today, I knew we needed to make a wise decision for our personal situation with all the promising cars on the market today.  The Tucson was the second car I took for a test drive.  Joshua King had introduced himself to me when he saw me browsing.  He was very good at listening to my needs, asking the right questions and answering mine .  As I left he thanked me for coming and said that he hoped that in my search I would find the car that was just right for me.  I was stunned and felt no pressure.  After test driving a number of cars I ended up purchasing a car with everything I hoped for and love.   And I am not a person that ""loves"" cars;  I appreciate dependability and safety.   And when I circled back to Hyundai after my search,  Joshua was very thorough and patient in helping me do the research I needed to help my husband and me make the decision.  When my husband became involved toward the end of the process, he was similarly impressed with Joshua.  Joshua was a great negotiator with us.  We have peace knowing that this car will provide all that we were looking for and more.  This is especially important  with this being a huge investment for us.  We don't even have an ounce of buyers remorse and that is most unusual for me.   We are so grateful to Joshua King, Anthony Erigio and Thomas Henschel (Anthony and Thomas are from the finance department) for their understanding and professionalism in making this purchase an informative and pleasant experience, resulting in our being very comfortable and pleased with our vehicle.

The car-buying process took about 3.5 hours, which is normal, I think. I had already made up my mind to buy a Hyundai Elantra, which I had test-driven before. He went through everything, step by step, with me, including the fact there is a tire fixing system in the trunk, instead of a spare--later, he showed me a video on how to use it, too. The whole process was fairly low stress, with one basic exception. I was under some pressure, from the finance guy, to be ""open-minded,"" as he put it, to buy an extended warranty, which I did not do, since Hyundais have excellent warranties, as they are. I had made up my mind ahead of time not to get any extra warranties. However, once I told this person I was not going to buy one, he did stop trying to seel me one, so that was good, too. Also, the dealership honored the Costco discount I was entitled to, as well as giving me thousands more in rebates and incentives. I could put money down on the car, so the monthly payments are going to be less, too. ",5.0

734,"September 30, 2015","This is a true story about a used car I purchased from Manly Auto Group on Corby Ave in Santa Rosa.
I asked to look at a 2010 Ford Flex and after waiting 20 minutes, the salesman drive up in a dirty car both inside and out looking nothing like the photo on the website. While test driving there was a noise coming from the left front of the car and I was assured it would be repaired in time for pick up on Monday.
After completing the trade and signing the papers, they gave me a loaner car until I was to return on Monday, perhaps Tuesday. 
I heard nothing from them until I called on Wednesday (from this point on, I became a customer who never received a call from Manly Auto until I called first, not a single one.) I got another call later that Monday telling me they were not going to fix the problem which I was told was the driver seat adjustment motor. So here I am, 9 days later, no car and another problem with the car that was not disclosed to me. Manly returned my call on Wednesday and I was told the car needed a part and it would not be ready until the following Wednesday.
Meanwhile, they kept putting new purchase contracts in front of me lowering the price as their promises began spinning out of control. So, I purposely waited until the following Wednesday to see if they would call and they did not. So I called Thursday and they promised to bring me the car on Sunday morning with a new purchase contract to sign.
So three weeks, no car and would you know that on Sep 2 the car BLEW A HEAD GASKET. I will be filing a Small Claims Court Action and Redwood Credit Union will be applying pressure as they were also sold a piece of collateral as fraudulent security for a car load.
If this review can save one person, no, five people from going to Manly Auto to buy a car, it is worth my telling this cautionary tale. Here are the names of the folks involved:
Gary Silva, Used Car General Manager, will not be fixing my car after his inspection of the engine.
Robert Trompeter, the Used Car Manager who left a week after I purchased the car.
Barry Silk, the salesman who first drove the car for me to test drive.
Clint Lyon, not anywhere close to the gutless wonders, but still working at Manly which says something.

1) Showing a sense of caring and constantly keeping our interest in mind.

Steve immediately understood our needs and our budget as well as appreciated our time.  As a result, he limited our selection of cars to preview.  In fact, we ended up purchasing the Sonata instead of the Impala we originally had in mind.

He also took care to stay on site while we finalized the financing.  We were both appreciative and surprised to see him after all the papers were signed.

2) Prompt follow up on outstanding items.

Because the car was not immediately available for delivery, Steve always kept us abreast of when we could actually take delivery of the car.  He always returned my calls in a reasonable amount of time.

Steve also promptly followed up on an e-mail I mistakenly received from a vendor.

Working with Steve and the staff in general at Manly was a very positive experience.

Everyone from the GM Robert Trompeter down to Barry and  Chris Yohannan in finance made sure that every detail was addressed and that there were no surprises. Just about every person at Manley introduced themselves and were available for every question. We are in our late 60s and have purchased more then 15 new cars, trucks and SUVs and this has proven to be our best experience. The only surprise was the genius of the Hyundai Genesis! Each time we get in it we say WOW! Every feature, detail and comfort has been engineered to amaze. The Genesis was built to amaze and the team at Manly Hyundai was assembled to amaze! This was worth the 8 hour roundtrip drive. 

This is a TEAM that we feel we can trust!

We headed first to Manly just to look since I was sure I was ready for something different from a Hyundai (we've already had two). Barry was extremely helpful and I decided to test drive a Sonata. He didn't pressure us at all but answered our questions and gave us his information in case we decided to come back. From there we test drove the other car I was sure I wanted further down the auto row - turns out it wasn't the right car for me. I had barely started the test drive and I knew I wanted the Sonata, after all. I also knew I wanted to deal locally with Manly and work with Barry. We went right back and he did what I asked in showing be something above the base model - again answering all our questions. Manly was great to deal with when it came to handling our trade-in (not a Hyundai), working with us on the pricing, and then when it came time to head into the Finance office to sign papers, Ali explained every bit of the financing with us and our warranty options.

The last vehicle I purchased was 20 years ago and had no idea what I was in store for. I explained this to the sales rep as soon as I was approached. I figured that I would be told to return with documentation of this and that. And required to give a large down payment. I am a very Spiritual woman and had prayed for ease and comfort in acquiring a new vehicle for months. I didn't tell the sales representative how much I needed my payment to be and certainly never expected to experience such professionalism under my circumstances. But lo and behold., I am now the proud owner of a new car. The salesman has called me several times to check on me. My only discomfort was,  I never expected to be there for long and I was starving. And getting very cranking and nauseous. Someone could have offered me something to eat. Also they assumed I had my down payment on me, and were willing to hand over the keys right then. I felt a little uncomfortable having to tell them I'd have to come back with the cash. I only went to that dealership because my best friend Amada, her ex husband owns it.

816,"October 22, 2014","I had been tracking the development of the redesigned, brilliantly upgraded 2015 Hyundai Genesis for over a year.  I was excited about what appeared to be a terrific car, yet dreading the experience of having to deal with car salesmen in order to get one.  Mark Sudmeier changed that for me, and made buying the car as pleasant as driving it.

Mark’s knowledge, courtesy and dedication to strong customer satisfaction made the process really smooth.  The first time I stopped into Manly to look at a newly arrived 2015 Genesis, I had my armor on.  I was expecting the usual car salesman pressure and tactics.  What a relief to be able to quickly drop that and just have a conversation with a super nice, zero pressure, real person. 

I did look at the car a few more times when I was on the road and saw other Hyundai dealers, and must say I didn’t feel at ease with the experience.  Plus, unlike Manly, some of these other dealers had dealer markups over and above MSRP.  Now that’s a clear sign to bolt for the exits!

It took me several months to be in a position to actually buy, and Mark never bugged me.  Of course I wanted a good price, but I also wanted a good, easy experience.  Negotiating the right price on a car is a voyage into the Twilight Zone, yet with Mark and Manly it was very easy and I was happy with the price I paid.  

A couple of things needed to be done to the car post delivery, and even though the sale was over, Mark was still there handling everything with care and precision.  He’s the gift with purchase.

The 2015 Hyundai Genesis is a terrific car – go drive one today!  I read all the early reviews, and the only real questions were if people were willing to spend so much on a Hyundai badge, interact with Hyundai dealers and if Hyundai should spin off Genesis into a separate, upscale line like Toyota did with Lexus.   My answers?  I’m delighted to have Genesis wings as my car’s badge, and yes it does turn heads.  Interact with a Hyundai dealer instead of an upscale dealer?  At Manly, and with Mark, the experience was upscale all the way.  Five stars.

852,"July 16, 2014","We had such a great experience buying from Manly, that we were disappointed for wasting so much time at other dealerships.  We had purchased our first Hyundai at Manly and forgot how easy it was 10 years ago.  We buy a new car or truck every 2-5 years and we NOW will not forget to go to Manly!!  

Steve McKerracher and Ali in finance was so easy without pressure, it did not seem like we could be done when we were.  We asked before we left, ""Are you sure you have everything?""  Process was so pleasant, it felt like something was wrong, but we went in with a fair price we wanted the car for, they had the car, they processed the paperwork & the deal was done!  No games... Loved the experience!!  

We have already referred two other people to Manly & Steve this past week.  Our first experience in 2004, we referred many family & friends and we know of 5 Hyundai's that were purchased specifically due to our referral and they had the same experience.  

Manly Hyundai is a great example for how all dealerships should be run!  I grew up around the auto repair industry and dealership experiences are the worst for me, I am still super surprised I could write such a positive review and without personally knowing someone... Its kind of surreal!  They really are this good though!  Buying a new car is one of my least favorite things to do, ""Thank You"" for a great experience, you'll never realize how much I appreciate it!   ",5.0

Obviously, we loved this car because we bought a second one. The experience was hassle-free; minimal sales pressure (and that, only associated with the extended warranty options which were numerous). I just wish the process could have taken less than 2.5 hours since we ended up being late for a reservation we had made.",4.8
855,"July 06, 2014","On the morning of July 4th, out of the blue and totally unexpected, my wife tells me I've got a green light to purchase a more economical vehicle. She threw down on the table in front of me a price guarantee from one of those Web car finder services for a Hyundai Accent. I'd had my eye on a new Hyundai Accent for a few months so the Accent wasn’t exactly a surprise. I quickly did my research shopping around with a car locater Website, I got some price guarantees, an idea as to what dealers were charging for what I wanted from LA to Eureka and SF to Sacramento, and what the value of my trade in would be. I knew I could trust the Manly Dealership in both Sales & Service. I trust Hyundai. My wife's 2004 Santa Fe has over 160K and is still running strong. I went to the Manly Website and found exactly what I wanted. It was kinda' weird as my wife said white would be a good color ...fat chance I thought, but Manly had it. While at the Manly Website I put in a request for the trade in value of my current vehicle and requested an estimate for the car I wanted to purchase, and saved the car. I'd looked at the new Accent a while back and found it to be much more roomy than the 2003 Accent I previously owned while having all of the bells and whistles of a car that would cost much more. Completing my research I picked up the phone and gave Manly a call. Barry Silk who I've done business with before had already shot several emails responding to my inquiries on the Web. I discussed the car and the trade in with Barry for a few moments and he assured me they would take care of all of my needs and concerns. Two hours later the Mrs., Barry and myself went on a test drive. Afterward we were sure the car was a good choice and Barry went to work. My wife outlined the deal she wanted to Barry. I had no expectations and came prepared to drive my old car for another 50K miles if he didn't put the deal together, but, to my amazement, Barry did it. Unlike other dealers I've done business with that came back with a trade in offer that was insulting and well below my expectations, Barry and Manly nailed it! Trade in, Hyundai Incentive, and no cash down; we drove off the lot in a brand new Accent. My wife can be a little tough when she lays out a deal. I really didn't believe it would work out that well. Barry didn't bug us with every little cost or nickel and dime us. He came back with a bottom line with some minor explanations, Manly met the online Web service's best discount, and Barry marched us over for the signing of the sales contract. I was absolutely amazed ...and to think I was considering going someplace else for the promise of a few dollars less ...yikes! When we were done signing, our new Accent had already been checked over thoroughly, detailed, filled with gas, and parked just outside the office where we completed the contract. We stepped out of the office, into our new Accent and drove over to our trade in vehicle. We grabbed our stuff out of the trade in and loaded it into our new Accent. Barry wished us well with a firm handshake and the evening of July 4th we drove off into the Sunset in a brand new Accent. My only regret is that after being treated so well by Barry and the Manly dealership that I had not at least taken my trade in vehicle to a car wash before we arrived at the Manly dealership. Please accept my apologies ...I didn't realize it was that dirty. I'm wondering where everybody else who was looking for a car had been on the 4th. You are sure missing out if you don't go to Manly. Ask for Barry in Internet Sales or Bill in service ...tellem' Linda Sue sent you!",5.0

Joe Reid, Charles Fuhrman and Robert Trompeter were without doubt the nicest, friendliest, gentlest guys you could ever wish to have help you make a purchase.
I Valerie was very skeptical of sitting down to discuss the possibility of buying a car since I was expecting so much pressure. 
After talking to Joe that day he, after spending a considerable amount of time with us detailing the offer was so understanding of our need to go home to discuss the offer etc.   I was amazed!
The next day we went back to Manly and saw Charles this time who was equally as pleasant as Joe.  He spent several hours explaining all the new features in the Sonata which we had now decided to buy.  He made us feel so comfortable and sure of our decision (after all it was the first car we had purchased in thirteen years when we bought the Hyundai XG350). It was all so relaxing.  
Robert who spoke with us several times treated us with such courtesy and under standing also added to our comfort.
These three guys are absolutely A ONE in our book. They undoubtably are one of the reasons that Manly has such a good reputation.

915,"February 27, 2014","Manly Hyundai Salesman Bob Kervin went all out taking care of my car needs this past weekend. Bob approached me as I was admiring the vehicle I was interested in. Immediately he introduced himself and welcomed me to the lot. I expressed interest in a 2007 Chevy Equinox parked on the front line. Bob explained some of the features of the vehicle and asked if I would like a test drive. I had just come from Sunday breakfast with my parents and they were invited to come along on the test drive. I really appreciated that. I got behind the wheel and off we went. The car was tight, smooth, quiet and operated perfectly. I needed a dependable car that was safe, built to last, decent fuel economy and, importantly, affordable. This was the car for me and Bob helped me to see that. It is a car I can afford to drive. I'm impressed and satisfied with the service I've received from Bob Kervin at Manly Hyundai in Santa Rosa. The best way I can think of to express my feelings is to say that Bob made me feel like one of the family.

920,"February 10, 2014","I really like this dealership.  Buying a car as a young woman is scary because you don't know if you're getting a good deal (or just getting ripped off).  When I was shopping around with Chris Samler, I didn't feel pressured to buy.  And he was very conscientious of my price point.  In the end, I ended up getting something a little below my budget.  One year out, I can say I am happy with the car I got.  I would definitely go back and I would recommend anyone (especially first time buyers) to go to this dealership to meet with Chris.",5.0

928,"February 02, 2014",We went into the dealership to look at the Veloster. Kent greeted us immediately and showed us the inventory they had of the Veloster. He was very knowledgeable about the car and was able to answer our questions. He suggested I take a test drive. After driving the Veloster I was concerned about the pick up...seemed a little sluggish. He suggested driving the Veloster Turbo. I did and was much happier with its performance. I asked if he could work up some ballpark numbers to purchase. He was happy to do so. I told him what color and features I would be interested in purchasing and he was able to locate that model at another Hyundai dealership and arranged to have that car brought up to his location. I decided to go ahead and purchase the car. It was a very good experience and never felt pressured. Very happy with the service and will definitely recommend the dealership and Kent to anyone I meet that is looking for a car. ,5.0

That continued the next day as he meticulously inspected the 2008 used Chevrolet Avalanche over the phone to me. After arriving and meeting Bob his professionalism was second to none. He allowed me to spend an hour and a half inspecting the vehicle with absolutely no pressure. I drove about 80 miles from home, and it was well worth it. Bob was spot on with his description of the vehicle. The price was right for the fully decked out like new condition LTZ Avalanche. If your looking for a car new or used, I would highly recommend Bob Kervin  at Manly Auto Group.",5.0
936,"January 25, 2014","In 2010 I went to Manly Hyundai in Santa Rosa to look at the Hyundai Tucson. I met sales consultant Barry Silk. He was exceptionally nice, helpful, and not pushy at all. I test drove the car and loved it. I wanted a white Tucson, and waited a bit until one came in., Barry would keep me informed during my wait. The Tucson came in and I was thrilled! Barry and sales manager Robert Trompeter worked with me and gave me a wonderful price........a couple of hours later, I was driving away in my brand new Tucson!  I absolutely love that car!

In September 2013, I decided to go look at the Hyundai Sonata. Of course, I called Barry and went in to see him. I fell in love with the Sonata  the first time I drove it! It has stylish lines, comfortable, great gas mileage, just a beautiful car! I again worked with Barry & Robert and got such a great price, I was able to keep the Tucson and get the Sonata. We are a two Hyundai family, and I couldn't be happier! I would absolutely recommend going to Manly Hyundai and working with Barry and Robert. It was a very pleasant, smooth, and easy experience working with them.",5.0

The financing process was simple, and although the finance manager offered me an extended warranty and paint sealant, there was no pressure to purchase either of these items. I love my new Sante Fe, and from now on I will always use Barry and Manly to buy my cars.",5.0

940,"January 24, 2014","We saw the car we wanted online and we drove from Fort Bragg to Santa Rosa to test drive it. Kent Argue was our salesperson and he treated us with respect and courtesy throughout the transaction. He offered us a test drive and then invited us inside to do preliminary paperwork and didn't fritz out when we said we needed time to think about it and that we were also looking at another car. We were expecting him to throw his body in front of the door when we tried to leave without buying a car from him, but he was totally calm and pleasant with us. When we came back in an hour to buy the car he didn't do an end zone dance, either. He was dignified but friendly throughout. He started the process and then turned us over to Ian Schmucker who finished the paperwork for us and was also very pleasant, efficient and courteous. I tried to bargain with him to lower the interest rate by offering to buy his mother some Le Cruset cookware, but he gently but firmly declined. Both gentlemen were professional, efficient, courteous and did not condescend to me or treat me as ""the little woman"", which I greatly appreciated. Overall, this was by far the best car-buying experience we have had.",5.0

I will definitely recommend him to work with when purchasing a vehicle. Furthermore, he was not pushy and made me feel comfortable to do business. Given that I am purchasing a car from Texas, he went above and beyond to find the best deal on transport in order to minimize my cost.",4.8

946,"January 14, 2014","Kent was the highlight of our experience besides the car. We negotiated a decent price but they could have gave more. If we weren't in a position where we had to buy a car that day we would have negotiated harder.
We enjoyed the process with Kent at this dealership in the negotiation process vs other dealerships we worked with.
They welcomed us to work with the manager directly instead of the dreaded back and forth between the unseen manager and the salesman.
Kent was up front, honest and realistic about what to do and expect.

952,"December 31, 2013","I'm writing this review to let others know that I was more than very satisfied with the level of service and expertise I received at Manly Hundai. That began with my salseman, Bill Corcoran. He was able to not only answer every question I had efficiently, but was able to make me feel completely comfortable in a setting I'm normally uneasy around. Buying a car can be a very stressful experience, and has been for me in the past. One thing I know for sure now is that I will come back to Manly and to Bill every chance I get, and that I will most certainly send friends and family in to receive that same level of service whenever possible.

962,"December 17, 2013","Became interested in trading cars early August. Started at Hyundai as I had read good things about the Genesis and liked how it looked. Two weeks later, I returned to test drive both the Azera and the Genesis. Like both, but was unsure about what to buy. Wound up looking at and test driving about 7-8 competitive models. Read reviews on all. Basically, decided on the Genesis. Got on line with True Car which I did not realize would generate a lot of emails and phone calls. Chris (at Manly) was the person who showed me the car and test drove with me so I felt some loyalty. He answered my questions thoroughly and did not pressure me. My preference was to deal locally (Sonoma county) vs. San Francisco or San Jose. When Manly was able to match other offers, I committed. There were actually some offers that may have been slightly better - but I did not like the aggressive nature of those dealers. Chris and Manly Hyundai are excellent to work with. My wife about 6 weeks later bought a new Honda from Manly next door which should give some idea of our satisfaction with the Manly group.",4.8

972,"July 21, 2011","I think my experience buying a used car from Manly Auto was as pleasant as it could have been. Buying a car is nearly always a stressful experience, of course, but Tony and Jessica were great in ensuring the process didn't add pressure. I never felt like I was being unduly rushed through the process, or that I was hurried into making a hasty assessment of the car. I was given as much time with it as I needed. There were minor issues with the car (twisted seat-belt, sticky substance in the glove box, cigarette smell), that I noticed after I took it home, and if I lived closer to the dealership I'm sure if I brought the car down they would try to address them, but it's just not worth it for me to drive down to Santa Rosa just for that. 

I came with my own financing, but I was open to dealership financing if they could beat my approved rate, and they were able to. Jessica gave me all the information I needed in weighing the options, and was very patient with us (and our busy baby). 

The reason why I say the Price was ""OK"" is that I don't necessarily feel like I got a GREAT deal, but that it was good enough, and I'm generally happy with it. I feel confident that if I would have had more time to wait on the local market, I could have got the same model at either the same price with 15k fewer miles, or a $500-1,000 dollars cheaper with the same miles. 

In summary, Manly Auto does not have your typical collection of shady salespeople, hucksters and high-pressure sales systems. I wasn't rushed into making a deal, I was given as much time with the car as I needed, and negotiating an out-the-door price was relatively painless. Manly Auto has a good reputation and I can see why. ",4.6
