1,"August 20, 2019","We have purchased other cars at this dealership so went back because of past experience. We had the extreme pleasure of working with Aaron Vega. Aaron is a very knowledgeable, friendly, and customer driven sales person. He helped us narrow our search and spent so much time with us as we constantly had questions to be answered. We went back over a few days as we eliminated other dealerships and cars. Aaron never once bombarded us with calls or texts or emails, he was not a hard pressure sales man and that was why he was such a pleasure to work with in our search. 
Aaron is the guy to go to for your Hyundai or Genesis needs! I'd give him more than 5 stars if I could!",5.0
2,"June 15, 2019","Working with me from day one on getting my new Ioniq, Keyvan Bigharaz was awesome. I really don't enjoy high-pressure sales guys at dealerships, and Keyvan never made me feel pressured at all. I initially went in for a test drive and explained that I would be ready to purchase in a couple of months... and surprisingly, he simply asked me to let him know when I was ready to buy. He was very considerate of my time and my needs, and when I came in to purchase he made it happen flawlessly. From getting me the right price to having most of the paperwork completed before I arrived, he had me out the door with my new car in just about an hour.",5.0
3,"April 28, 2019","I was there yesterday to buy a car, our salesman Sean was good and professional, but very unhappy with Alex Marouf, the financial manager, who was so annoying and rude and didn't want to stop trying to sell us additional warranties, only for this reason I'm giving only 3 stars rating.",4.0
4,"April 12, 2019","They are a bunch of unprofessional who don't care about theirs customers. They mislead me into leasing a car. I have tried to book a service which is included in my payment, they never replied. Tried to complain, just once they contacted me and they said they get back to me, they did not. I sent a text message to the manager, it showed ""Read"" but he did not even bother to respond. 
I am so disappointed and nobody is there to help me out. I tried to complain to Hyundai, they said if there was a mechanical or technical issues they could get involve but I have to sort it out with the those crooks directly which is impossible.",1.0
5,"April 10, 2019","I would strongly recommend that you get an estimate from another dealership before you get your vehicle serviced at Allen. What I was quoted for a major tuneup was several hundred dollars more than Tustin Hyundai. I was so stunned and upset because I had been using Allen for several months. That's a big gap. I will no longer take my vehicle to Allen.
Consumers be ware!",2.4
6,"March 29, 2019","When I got into the dealership Kevyan was the first person that walked up to me. It was straight business, I told him what car and price I wanted and he made it happen. I didn't have to hassle or bargain too much and I got a great deal on a new Genesis g70.",5.0
7,"February 23, 2019",Just be sure to get it is writing what they are to do and do NOT authorize anything without your approval.  They will find ways to charge for things and they have no real explanation why it takes so very long to do a simple task.  Does anyone think it should take an hour to change a defective light bulb in the trunk?  Wal-Mart does it complimentary.  Hyundai Laguna is certainly trying to maximize its profits at the service counter.,1.6

Aldo is fantastic! He is truly a superstar!
He was professional, knowledgeable and honest. He treated us like close family member. His approach was not pushy and made us feel like we could trust him which led us to come to this dealership. I have brought many cars over the past 35 years and this was one of the best experiences ever. 
Thank you!",5.0
9,"February 10, 2019","I have seen a second hand car online and it was exactly what I was looking for.

The salesman greeted me with a smile and he said Welcome To Allen Hyundai, how can I help. He went inside as I was looking at the car  ( which looks great) and came back with the keys.

The best part is when the Sales Manager Blair intervened and said are you being taken care of, which was very considerate of him.
I ended up talking with Bessai and Blair about my deal,  talking to both of them I felt like they were old friends,
At Allen Hyundai the customer is king and both of these managers proofed it,
the Allen family should be very proud to have Blair and Bessai on your team
Thank you again for caring and making your customers happy!",5.0
10,"January 11, 2019","I called the service department and talked to Ivan Avalos regarding my car's fuel range showing erroneous number.  I told him that in the last 3 years when ever I filled my gas tank, the range on my dashboard would show that the tank take me 400-420 miles (which gives a reasonable average of 22-25 MPG as advertised for my car, i.e. a Santa Fe 2015).  However the last time it showed 300 miles.  I asked for an appointment so this could be fixed.  I also mentioned that this happened after I brought my car for installing the KSDS software (a product improvement campaign by Hyundai).  He became defensive and argued with me that there is nothing wrong and they cannot fix my car.  He said you might have changed your driving habit, etc.  I let him know that when you fill the tank, without driving a foot, it showed 300 miles.  How is that related to my driving habit? He could not or did not want to understand.  At the end he said you can bring your car but we would tell you nothing is wrong!!!!  So much for your service Allen Hyundai!!!!",1.0
11,"September 14, 2018",VERY PLEASANT EXPERIENCE.  Would highly recommend seeing Mark for your salesman wonderful salesman.  Craig in finance was very easy to work with great person.  GREAT,5.0
12,"September 11, 2018","Hyundai has a 3 day return policy if you have any issues with a car you purchase from them, but it is not supported by all dealerships.  This dealership does not honor this policy, and was surprisingly unconcerned with customer service after they sold me the car.   Even though I brought back the car within 48 hours of purchasing it after I saw the issue, and even though the information they gave me about the condition of the car when they inspected it was different from what I saw when I picked it up again, neither the General Service Manager or General Sales Manager responded to emails or telephone calls to address the issue.  In fact, the General Service Manager could not even meet with me when I was at the dealership picking up the car.  I was told he was busy all afternoon and would call me, and he never did.  

It's nice when they treat you well when all is going well, but to me what is more important part is how they treat you when things go wrong.  I felt they failed really badly on that score.  There are better Hyundai dealerships out there.",1.0
13,"August 28, 2018",Service rep tried to force a $135 diagnostic test on me to replace a $6 oil drain plug damaged after last oil change. I said no. He also said I would have to pay another $135 to check a noise in the steering I have had since I bought the vehicle new 6 years ago. I agreed because my mechanic friend said it could fall apart at any time. Service person said it would take three hours to check the steering and change oil. I spent over an hour on the shuttle to get home. 3 hours later I had to call to find out what was going on. They said it was fixed. I asked for the shuttle. Two hours later it arrived. Never again will I visit this ruthless dealership. On my previous visit my car was damaged. It took over one week to get scraped paint fixed. ,1.0
14,"August 13, 2018","As much as I'm happy with my 2016 Hyundai Sonata Plug In, I'm equally frustrated and extremely disappointed in Hyundai's service and follow up. My car stranded me over 2 months ago. Although the car was under warranty, I had to call Uber to get home. The cost was out of pocket and Hyundai has not answered my request for reimbursement. The local dealer where I towed the car (Allen Hyundai Laguna Niguel) did not offer a loaner car until 3 to 4 days later when they realized the recall parts for my car were in back order (shocking… but Hyundai has not answered my request for reimbursement for towing either).  After 2 weeks without my car... and countless phone calls to the dealer and Hyundai Corporate, the dealership determined they could by-pass the recall and I could drive my car safely until the parts came in. I got another ride and picked it up and they said they would contact me when the recall parts came in. During the next few weeks, I made several calls to Hyundai Consumer Affairs (totally ignored me). Brandon at 714-965-7080 (the “so called” claim advisor who was specifically hired to handle these types of issues) is a complete waste of time and a joke. After several attempts to get in contact with him, we finally spoke and he assured me he was going to make everything right. Said ""you can call me any time and I will respond immediately"". That was a flat out lie. I've left him countless messages to no avail. The parts finally came in and rather than sending them to the local dealer near my house like I requested and Brandon (the non-responsive) agreed to do, they sent them to Laguna Niguel where lip service is their primary goal. Needless to say, I had to drive back to Laguna Niguel for the 7th time regarding this recall – a total and complete inconvenience. Prior to driving there, yet again, I called them and asked if they could loan me a car while they worked on my car for the next 3 to 4 hours...without hesitation, Ivan Avalos, the service advisor immediately said NO….something about we’re really busy and he couldn't help me. Fortunately, I was able to coax my wife into going out of her day and driving me there again. After dropping off my car, Ivan (the not so service oriented service advisor) totally surprised me by asking if I needed a ride or shuttle to my next destination. I asked why he didn't mention or offer that service when I spoke with him in the morning prior to begging my wife for a ride, and again he said, I'm sorry but we're really busy and I must have forgot. On every occasion that I asked for assistance, his initial knew jerk response was always NO. I guess he figures since Hyundai is experiencing so many problems that his job is pretty secured.
 
Bottom Line… great car…extremely terrible service and follow up from top to bottom. Ironically, Hyundai sent me a survey asking for my feedback…like they were actually going to do something about it. I can just imagine what my next anti-service experience will be like.",1.8
15,"June 28, 2018","Customer service AAA++. They are all very nice and friendly. Very helpful, no pressure. I would recommend my friends and family to purchase the car from them. My purchase was smooth and best deal ever. Thanks. I love my car.",5.0
16,"May 29, 2018","I knew what car I wanted and wanted to get it as cheap as I could.  I messaged 20+ dealerships overnight.  Aldo Balgioni responded.  He was short and professional, at no point did he seem like he was selling something, but he still seemed engaged.  He asked me what I wanted, I told him, and he met me at my requirements and price without any hassle.  I came in and bought the car, out the door in less than an hour.  Even on the finance side, the advice was actually consultative and helpful.  I would likely end up re-leasing with them for life, assuming there is no change in how the place was managed.",5.0
17,"April 02, 2018","In attempting to contact the right people to try and solve a long lingering problem, I provided my current email address.  Not verbally, not even a hand written note, but electronically.  So all they have to do is copy and paste.  Instead they went to the archives and against my instructions used some other email that I have not used in year.  YEARS.  I am unsure how I could have been any more clear.  I provided my new email so very clear and I have no idea why they would go back 10 years to use an some other email I do not even use anymore.  This all seems to be part of an effort to try and NOT resolve my problems.  Why else would they ignore contact information provided weeks ago and instead use out-of-date contact information from 2008?  Maybe it is so they could claim they tried to contact me while they really had to go out of their way to ignore my instructions and dig in the files.  Shame on you Allen Hyundai of Laguna Niguel.",1.0
18,"April 01, 2018","Sean Guetssoyan is ""EXCELLENT"", he is very professional, extremely knowledgeable with the Hyundai vehicles, and an all around hospitable, personable, friendly, pleasant, and congenial, sales consultant   We visited Allen Hyundai just to view the Hyundai Santa Fe Sport. After Sean demonstrated all the amazing features this vehicle has and the fabulous pricing we drove off in a new 2018 Santa Fe Sport fully loaded with the Tech and Ultimate Premium package. This was an extremely easy transaction and  Sean was amazing through the entire process, he took the time to explain all the phenomenal features before we left the dealership. I highly recommend Sean Guetssoyan for anyone looking for first class professionalism and knowledge from a sales consultant in purchasing a Hyundai vehicle. These Hyundai's are so amazing ( 5 star safety, amazing features) I'm thinking of selling my 2015 Mercedes E350 and purchasing a Hyundai!.",5.0
19,"March 17, 2018","I can see the staff up front getting too busy to return a call.  But after a problem popped up, the business development manager, Samantha, transferred me to the service manager.  I left a very detailed message.  They have my phone, they have my email.  I don't know.  Seems to be unresponsive and the false hope of ""Making things right"" and ""Earning my business"" seems like hollow phrases to be added to bad reviews.  When actually called upon to ""Make things right"" they seem to just ignore the customer.  The wort part is I bought three, yes three cars from them.  It is time for a new one again, they will not get the sale.  Or the service.  Or the recall service which we all know is a super-profitable venture.  Perhaps I will contact the Fountain Valley people.  See what they say about an unresponsive dealership.",1.4
20,"March 12, 2018","While researching vehicles, I was doing many vehicle test drives at a variety of dealerships. Allison Skelly was very helpful. I had many questions and drove three different vehicles. Allison was very knowledgeable of the Genesis line. She was very patient with me and addressed all of my questions and concerns. She took her time to make sure I could make the right decision on my new vehicle based on my time with her and my time in the vehicles. She also made certain that I had brochures with the features that mattered to me highlighted. She followed up with me as promised. I would highly recommend her if you are interested in a Hyundai or Genesis product. ",5.0
21,"February 28, 2018","Unfortunately I am unable to use the phone due to a noisy environment.  Hyundai of Laguna Niguel, also known as Allen Hyundai, has a chat feature.  However that feature is a waste of time.  All they do is forward whatever request is to the dealership.  As a matter of fact, the chat people are not even in the building.  The will always send a link but they do not seem to listen to the question.  So for me, this was a waste of time on not one, but two occasions.  If I could call in I would.  So noisy where I am, difficult to hear.  But still better than the chat feature.  Avoid it is what I can recommend.",1.2
22,"February 03, 2018","After having purchased 3 vehicles from Allen and having all the service done, I was charged a ludicrous amount to change light bulbs.  When I asked about it I should have put my foot down, but I was assured someone would get back to me and it would be fine.  Well I do not know about anyone else, but after a year then never got back to me.  Now there is a recall for 2 of the vehicles.  We have been getting service done elsewhere but we all know how these recalls are good for the dealer.  So I call them and they are pretty much sticking to the fact it takes 45 minutes to change 3 lightbulbs all located in the trunk.  So we are just going to take our business to North County instead.  Maybe they have been good for you, but after spending thousands on service with them, not a penny more.  Now that I think of it, why did I even bother to call and check with them?  We all have bad days.  I get that.  But this is strike 3.  So long Allen, my money, and recall money, goes elsewhere now.

Note: There is no bad language in this review.",1.8
23,"February 01, 2018","I worked with Allison Skelly - very knowledgeable and helpful through the whole process. I love the Service people also at Allen - and that combination of excellent Service and Allison in sales made me a very satisfied customer!

24,"January 29, 2018","I was purchasing my first new car, so I really didn’t know what to expect, but Cris made the process very smooth and felt like he was looking out for the customer.

25,"December 31, 2017","1.Navigation missing. During driving, I found there is no navigate. They said, “Probably somebody used the navigation chip in your car. come back 1 week later to install navigation chip. I will order the chip for you.  2.No explanation for the car manual . I went back 1 week later. They did not know if the chip arrived or not. and they were looking for the chip. Finally they found chip in service department. I think they should have called me if they have navigation chip or not before I come .  I met one person  on that day. I asked to him. “No body explains for the manual when I bought car. Can you explain?” He said”Ok”  but in the middle of explanation, “ I have to go, new customer is coming” He left from me. Then left there.  3. Because while I bought the car, my agent and the manager was involved for the decision of price. Finally I asked $2,000 to the manager and he said “OK” Finally I was introduced to go to “Finance department “ And I was wandering if $2,000 was deducted or not. I ask him, “can I see my agent here” “No he went home.” I paid all in cash and came out the “finance department “  but surprisingly we (my wife and me) saw that my agent was in the one of his office. But we left the dealer without comfort for the payment.",1.3

30,"December 19, 2017",Cris Baker and Blair Morrison were always there for me as I took forever to decide which color and upgrade package I wanted.  They were both kind and patient with me as I can be a pain in the ****** because I am so picky.  I got exactly what I wanted and they are so great to work with as this vehicle was very difficult to obtain; no fault of the salesmen though. Hopefully in the near future Genesis will be able to take customer orders on their G80's and G90's.  I am extremely happy with the G80 I am leasing; fantastic beautiful car and is the perfect sedan for my profession as a Realtor in Orange County.  Rob Sewell,5.0
31,"December 19, 2017",Maybe it was my fault but I should have been shown other vehicles that had back up camera. At one point my salesman did not think the Elantra even had such so directed us to the Sonota which we ended up purchasing. I later found out the Elantra did indeed have a back up camera so I purchased it. It was never suggested to look at the Accent. I assumed it didn't have the camera but later found out it did. I should have purchased that one.  It took at least 3 hours from when I agreed to the purchase to get out the door. The finance guy had no ability to read the customer to when to realize no means no. This was pure torture.,4.3

I changed the search to show dealerships in south Orange County and found Allen Genesis.  In looking at their inventory online I discovered the exact car I wanted.  I called and spoke with Johnny Cribari who confirmed that the model was available.  Within a very short period of time, we worked out a deal to trade in my 2012 Camry and purchase the G80.

We have serviced both cars here for the last 3 years.  I have to say that the service experience just keeps getting worse and worse.  We always end up having to take the car back because something wasn't done or something was done wrong.  I know things happen but it's over and over and over.  A recent issue was a 60K mile service and I have to take the car back because it's leaking brake fluid because after the brake service, things weren't tightened appropriately.  It's just always something.  It's too bad as I've given them the benefit of the doubt over and over hoping the experience will change.  I think it's time to find another dealer to service our vehicles.  Today was the last straw.  After another issue and the dealer is not able to resolve it after having the car for the week, I was told I could come and pick up the car as they were going to wash it for me.  I went to pick up the car, waited for them to bring it up.  When they finally brought it up, do you think it was washed?  Nope.  DId I want to wait another 15 minutes for them to wash it?  Nope.

At no point during the sales process did I feel like I was being taken advantage of. What we agreed to over the phone was what I got and paid for and not one penny more.  The purchasing experience could not have been any easier or smoother. I loved the attentiveness and also the quick responsiveness of Jamie and the other employee's.

I was on vacation and experienced a check engine light on my vehicle and I had a Turbo booster issue a few weeks ago that my local dealer repair but this past Saturday July 15,2017 I experienced the same issue and called my local dealer to inform them that the same issue occurred .Parkway Hyundai in Valencia suggested that I did not drive the car any distance back home and I immediately find a local dealership to take a look at the car and repair the issue. I was in a panic because this was at 1PM on a Saturday afternoon and your service department hours where til 4PM. When I arrived at your service department they directed me to a service advisor, Mathew, greeted me and inquired what he could help me with. I explained I was on vacation and what had happen to my car. Mathew was very good at listening to my concerns and told me let me fill our a service ticket and I will have one of our techs look to see what the issue is. Mathew took me to the customers lounge and said there is water and seating for you and I will keep you informed ASAP about your car. He updated me two times and within a 1-1/2 Mathew came into the customer lounge and said your car is all repaired and suggested that I should soon return to my local dealer and have them replace the  turbo booster cable( which Mathew had already ordered one that it would be in sometime Monday and that I could come back Monday and that your dealership would replace it), I informed Mathew that had to return home on Monday morning but Mathew did assure me that the tech did reattach the existing turbo booster and that it would be just fine to drive home. 
I just wanted to give your service advisor Mathew a ""BIG SHOUT OUT"" for his excellent customer service that he gave me and being so caring to assure me that he would try to do what ever it takes to repair my vehicle. I'm in management with a large corporation and would love to have all my associates to deliver excellent customer service to my customers.
Thanks again Mathew you saved my vacation!!!!!

I'd like to state upfront that the people at the dealership that we dealt with were friendly, but they were woefully ill prepared to sell the Ioniq Elictric.  1.) They did not have a Level 2 charger. We received our car with only a 49% charge.  2.) We live about FOUR hours from the dealer. Before going we arranged everything over the phone internet. We were only interested in the Ioniq Subscription. We applied for the credit online (on the dealer's website) and were told that we qualified. They knew how far away lived. During the trip our salesperson (Chi) asked us to send him my license and insurance to expedite the visit, which we appreciated, and so we texted these to him.  3.) After traveling all the way to the dealer, they had absolutely nothing ready for us. We had to fill out a new credit app and other papers. (We purchased as HONDA the week before and all papers were filled in for us when we arrived; we only needed to sign and leave; literally 10 minutes; in comparison the HYUNDAI experience was miserable). After waiting some time, they came back to us and said they were sorry, but we did not qualify for the Subscription! This was after being told that we did qualify and after driving there for FOUR hours.  4.) If you truly care about your customers, please think about this situation for a minute! They either flat out lied to us to get us to come into the dealership, or they were utterly incompetent.  5.) Cameron Allen said he felt very bad about this and offered to pay us for our gas. While that is something, it in no way makes up for their blunder.  6.) Cameron did not have a good understanding of your Electricity Charging Reimbursement Credit that is an integral part of the Unlimited Subscription. When they discovered their blunder regarding our credit (791 FICO) they tried very hard to sell us the Ioniq Hybrid. The car is for my daughter to commute daily (Mon-Fri) to college. The commute is 105 miles, which is 2275 miles per month. So the unlimited mileage and the Charging Reimbursement Credit were critical to our situation. Since leasing the Hybrid has a mileage cap, he tried to sell us the Hybrid. But the cost of gasoline for my daughter would still be very high (nearly $200 per month). Cameron insisted that the Charging Reimbursement for the Electric was capped each month at $40. This is NOT true. It is capped at 50,000 miles total, but with no monthly caps. Estimating 2,500 miles monthly for my daughter's transportation needs, the rebate is on average $105.  7.) In the end, they threw their hands up and insisted we did not qualify for the Unlimited Subscription of the Ioniq Electric. This is not acceptable or professional. Hyundai dropped the ball and would not fix it.  8.) Since we needed this car for my daughter, I asked if I could call my brother-in-law to be a co-signer. They agreed, and since his FICO is 890 they INSISTED that he be top line on the lease. This made me extremely angry. He has nothing to do with the car and lives THREE hours away from us. But with his help we were able to get the car. My brother-in-law was a saint in this situation. What's the opposite of a saint? That's how I feel about Hyundai and this dealer.  9.) Insisting that my brother-in-law be topline also jeopardized all of our rebate opportunities, which are substantial: California ($2500), San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District ($3000), Southern California Edison ($450). Each of these want to see the name of the owner/lesee and address match the registration and insurance name and address and in the case of SJVAPCD the address is supposed to be in their district.  10.) We told Cameron that the car was for my daughter and that she was in fact the person paying for the car with her own funds that she has from a traffic accident settlement. She just graduated high school and has not established credit yet, but she was willing to prepay the lease entirely upfront. They would not let her do so. And in the end the only way forward was for us to use my brother-in-law. But if ANY of these three rebates fails becuase of their inistance tat my brother-in-law (who lives in Orange County) be top line, I will consider this nothing short of THEFT of my daughter funds. This was the farthest from professional business dealings that I have ever seen in my 52 years.  11.) We were stranded at the Allen Dealership for nearly EIGHT hours for this nightmare. Cameron offered to buy us dinner and we accepted and that was appreciated.  12.) Chi (salesperson) did NOT take us on a test drive. He did give us the keys to the Hybrid and let us drive that early on. I was very annoyed that the very first thing Chi did was ask us to fill out the survey of our car buying experience. This was right after we got there, and he encouraged us to give the best score for each question. It made no sense. The questions were about the test drive, the condition of the car, etc. At that point we had no test drive and we had not even seen the car! It was not until hours late when my brother-in-law was on his way that they finally allowed us to test drive the Ioniq Electric. The ONLY car we were interested in, even though they tried very hard to sell us the hybrid, which absolutely did not work for us and would consume way too much of my daughter trust fund in terms of payments, gasoline, and the loss of the rebates from California, San Joaquin, and Edison. Note: Chi is a very nice person, but this would have been totally unprofessional to have us evaluate our experience BEFORE it actually happened, even if we had had a stellar experience ultimately. The fact that our experience was the single worse car buying experience I have ever had and I've purchased over 20 new cars from just about every major brand in my lifetime and Chi had us report that it was all roses before we even started is stunning. YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED.  13.) Chi has absolutely no idea how to turn on the vertical light strips on the front of the car, the ones directly below each headlight. We asked him how, but he could not give us and answer. He said he would find out and let us know. He never did. We figured it out on our own a few days later.  14.) The Blue Link was not working properly from the moment we took possession of the car. Whenever we tried to use it or the phone app it stated that we needed to see the dealer. Since we live so far away, we took it to the Palmdale, CA dealer. They had the car for nearly TWO weeks before it was fixed. And they did nothing to fix it. It was Blue Link that finally reset something remotely and then it worked perfectly. The Palmdale dealership did give us a rental car that they paid for and that was much appreciated, but this was an absolutely terrible performance by Hyundai/Blue Link and it seemed like nothing got done until I got mad and called Blue Link and got them to call the Palmdale Hyundai Dealer (Rally Hyundai).  15.) No one explained that the car did NOT come with Navigation. While Apple Car Play is sort of a solution, it's not really. It requires cell phone data, which means the car has to be in an area with reception, and the driver had better have an unlimited cellular data plan. In this century, I have never owned a car without Navigation until now. It is beyond me how anyone would think it is OK to sell an All-Electric vehicle without Navigation as stardard!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Electric vehicles have severely limited range and finding a charging station is paramount. It's obvious the car has a GPS receiver since it know how far it is to the NEAREST charging station. But honestly, what good is that is you don't know how to get there? With electric cars, navigation CANNOT be an option. It has to absolutely be standard. We have a four-year-old Honda Fit EV. It is standard on that car. You CANNOT buy that car without navigation. They get it. You don't. Do you people even drive these things? Not everyone lives in the city. We live in the mountains far from the city and there are vast stretches with ZERO cellular reception. We like the Ioniq a lot, but I would not at least 3 stars off (out of 5) for the boneheaded decision to sell any Electric Car without navigation. Seriously, this is the dumbest idea I have ever seen.  16.) When I called Chi to confirm that the car did indeed not come with Navigation (at first I thought I just must not be seeing the proper button!!!) he actually told me that he just assumed I had done my research, which was highly inappropriate. And while I had done weeks of research, this simple fact totally eluded me. Every video on YouTube that I watched about the Ioniq Electric showed the map screen, and your website does not do a good job of pointing out this ""lack of navigation"".  I would greatly appreciate it if someone would call me regarding this survey. I am not a happy customer at all!  Note: Leslie Smiley was professional and nice.  Daniel Ferry (661) 750-2109",2.0

180,"June 23, 2017","I received an email from Hyundai offering a gift card if I test drove a car. After I downloaded the paperwork for this, my phone started ringing... Turns out a salesman was calling me to ""schedule"" a test drive. I have enough to do and would much rather test drive a car at my own convenience and not receive calls at work from random ph numbers. In any case I told Jaime - the salesman that called- I would see  him the following Sat. I met him and sat for a few minutes with him. His first questions was ""So what brought you in here today? Did you see our ad?"" I said ""No. A gift card promo offer and my lease it coming to term did it."" ... He just said ""Oh"". (Stupid me - WHAT WAS THE AD OFFERING ??? He sure as heck didn't show me). In any case here's the deal: Jaime is not perfect. Neither am I. I had to follow-up with him about the gift card. I still don't have the cargo net (but Jaime says I can keep calling and I come get it when it arrives :)) - but at all times we treated each other with RESPECT. I cannot say this for your Finance Manager, Alex. He is extremely rude, condescending and refuses to answer a direct question, lied to me - Jaime told me that to make this deal his Manager was going to pay my first month's lease payment. When I told Alex this, he quite rudely pointed to one area of the paperwork and said ""It says 35!"" (well, yes it does but upon later examination, another area of charges I'm responsible for it has the first month's payment amount = that make 36, Alex :) I'm just pointing this out for his ""own education""). In any event, a few days after the deal Alex called me at work and rudely insists that I come down that day to dealership because they cannot get the lease funded. I feel that he insinuated, more than once, that the problem was ME. I had to pull it out of him that there was an ""error"" made and I was charged for something I should not have been. Well when I went down there to help him correct HIS MISTAKE, he was beyond rude to both my father and myself. I will never do business with this dealership again.",1.0

When I showed up, they were already familiar with me because the other dealership had been trying to work out a trade. The car was there, I was pre financed, and the whole process only took a little over 2 hours. I never felt pressured or like I was being brow beaten into things I didn't want or need, a pet peeve of mine with car dealers.

I was a Bank of America Vice President in the corporate leasing and lending depts. in downtown LA working with many of the biggest and best clients in So. Ca., for many years.  I can very plainly and simply state that  fm 2014-2017, your leasing dept. employees and supervisors ( ? ) that I had to deal with were at Best, UNinformed, UNintelligent, Rude, Slow, ( pick as many Negative adjectives that you would like) that I have ever had to deal with in my entire life!

I gave up and asked a ""manager/supervisor""(?)  for an AUDIT of my account at the 30th month of my 36 month lease. They killed many trees by copying ( on only ONE side)  ALL of my 30 monthly statements that they had already mailed to me! That was their ""AUDIT"" of my account!  I was very happy to BUY this 2017 Sonata Turbo, so as to NEVER deal with those people ever again!  I expect/hope that I will not have any problems with your loan dept.!? I will also state that my loan interest rate at B of A is 2.6% almost 1/2 of your rate of 4.99%. That is, of course, why your loan dept. had to offer many $$$ upfront to entice me to use them with their HIGHER interest rate !  My ""reward"" is to overpay them interest $$$!

235,"April 21, 2017","Mr. Vega was extremely helpful and straight forward.  I told him I wanted either the Tuscon or Sante Fe base models and nothing over the top. He showed me those exact models and let me drive them thoroughly.  My wife wanted to test drive the Veloster and he was more than happy to show it to us. In fact, the only veloster they had was the one on the showroom so they took it off the showroom to test drive.  I didn't like the roughness of the veloster so I chose the Sante Fe since it felt smoother on the drive.  Mr. Vega did not try to convince me to buy the Veloster because he knew already that the Santa Fe was the car I came in to purchase.  Mr. Vega and his boss got me to the best price without any haggle back and forth for hours.  They showed me one price for the veloster and I told them it was to high. I told them to lower the price of it and to bring me back the Santa Fe at the best price they could offer since they did not show me the Santa Fe at the same time.  The Santa Fe price was excellent and it helped me choose it over the Veloster as well besides what I stated earlier as it being the smoother ride.  I think I was in and out of the dealership in 3 hours which could have been cut down if my wife didn't want to test drive more vehicles besides the Tuscon and Santa Fe.",5.0

278,"February 27, 2017","My husband and I went to Allen Hyundai to look at their SUV s. Aaron Vega welcomed us with a friendly smile. We explained the reason for our visit and that we were not buying that day. At other dealerships we have experienced the very pushy type of sales person that does not listen and tries everything to make a sale that day, or the sales person that once hears that we are not buying today they just walk away and wont help at all. Aaron stayed and answered any questions we had. He gave us his undivided attention and showed us each model of SUV that Hyundai had to offer. The test drive was great. He offered us a route to drive as well as the option of us making our own test drive route. Aaron was very knowledgeable about Hyundai vehicles. He broke everything down so we could understand all the great features Hyundai had to offer. When we left, he gave us his card, thanked us for stopping by, and told us if we have any questions to give him a call. The next day he gave us a call and thanked us once again for stopping by and reminded us that if we needed anything he would be happy to help. A couple days latter I went back to the dealership, this time with my daughter. It was raining and cold. He was happy to get wet from the rain to show my daughter the car we were interested the most in. A few days later I called him up and told him that we wanted to buy the SUV. We found the one that suited my needs and desires. I filled out the credit app online thru their website. Everything was set for me to go down the next day, view the car once more to make sure that was the perfect car, and sign paperwork. I got extremely ill during that night and was unable to go to the dealership the next day. A couple days later I went in. He asked how I was feeling. He had already pulled the car and placed a sold sign on it even though we had not signed paperwork. As a typical woman, I wanted to look at another color to be sure we were getting the right color. He grabbed the other color and drove it next to the original color. He gave me all the time I needed to go back and forth deciding the color. I finally made my decision. He had Juan Arellano come over and explain all my options on financing and rebates. Juan took his time to make sure that I understood everything and that I was completely satisfied and comfortable with my decision. As Juan was processing everything, Aaron took me out to the car and went over all the features once again. Showed me how everything worked. After I was done, I met with Alex Marouf to sign all the paperwork. He explained every paper I was signing, answered all my questions, and never once rushed me through the process. Once everything was done and finalized, I was driving away in My new 2017 Santa Fe Sport! A few days went by, I received an email from Aaron thanking me for my purchase. Once again said he would be there to answer any questions I may have about my new car. He even invited me to come down to the dealership and he would show me how to work the features if I needed help. In the end, Allen Hyundai did a great job. The staff I dealt with gave us excellent service from start to finish and still providing excellent customer service, never once did I feel pushed to buy or rushed through the process. I have never felt so valued as a customer before. Aaron and his colleges earned us a customers for life. Thank you for making everything so easy.

303,"January 24, 2017","Shortly after purchase of 2016 Tucson, I commented that the transmission seems to hesitate, but was told that I needed to adjust to this kind of transmission. Then I received a recall to fix the transmission, but it did not fix the problem; I took it in for 2nd time, and was told when there that there was a 2nd recall for the transmission, so I thought this time they could fix it, but the same thing happened... no improvement. The transmission seemed even worse, especially in the morning, with a ""shuddering"" feeling when first driving that day, along with the hesitation at other times... so I took it in for a 3rd time with no results; I was told that they could not ""duplicate"" the problem that I described and that I needed to ""adjust to this kind of transmission"". Everybody has been courteous but I don't feel that they gave it a thorough test. I mentioned that the transmission on the loaner car (Elantra) seemed normal, but was told that the Tucson has a ""special"" transmission, and was given a writeup about it.  if this is ""normal"" for a Tucson, then the vehicle is not worth the money I paid for it and I could not recommend the Tucson to anybody else. If my specific vehicle is the only one that acts this way, it is apparently a ""lemon"", and should be replaced with another vehicle. ",3.2

316,"January 04, 2017","I recently purchased my second vehicle in two years from Chris Baker.  I met Chris three years ago when I was evaluating a Genesis.   While I did not make a purchase decision at that time, I was so impressed by the integrity of Chris Baker, my sales professional, and his management staff, that I actually put Chris' name in my Outlook Contacts.  He is the ONLY automotive sales professional I have in my contacts -- the reason being that I couldn't ask for any better relationship in an automotive transaction.   We took the car for several drives, evaluated whether we could get a drum set into it (we brought the drums with us), and went over the car stem to stern.   Chris answered all our questions and showed extraordinary patience.  At the end of the day, we got a very equitable deal on our car.  I'm planning to see Chris this December when my lease runs up on my current vehicle.",5.0

I've had past experiences with test drives and purchases at other local dealerships where they have the hard sale mentality and this experience was BY FAR the best.

He was a complete pleasure and delight to deal with.  Allen was the second dealership we had been to the day we purchased our car.  We had gone to Tuttle Click Hyundai and the experience was horrible. They couldn't find 2 cars which were listed on their website, even after I called and ""verified"" with them that the 2 cars were there and available. They tried to sell us other vehicles that we clearly were not interested in. We knew what we wanted. The person I spoke to on the phone didn't tell us he was leaving within the hour and would not be there when we arrived (2 hours later).  The dealership was a mess.

420,"September 07, 2016","I would characterize my purchase of a 2016 Hyundai Accent from Allen Hyundai as very fast and very fair. I researched the exact model I wanted to purchase online ahead of time and then arranged for a test drive through Allen Hyundai Internet Sales. When I arrived on-site for the test drive, sales representative Aaron Vega had the exact model parked just outside the front door ready to go. I was literally starting my test drive within a few minutes of arriving. After the test drive, we agreed on the price within less than 2 minutes. The price was very fair in comparison to what other Accent models were selling for based on my research. The overall experience was excellent. Researching the inventory online is a way to save time if you want to minimize your time spent at the dealer. Or if you prefer to look at all the models in person rather than researching online, that will work too. The sales representatives at Allen Hyundai are happy either way (if you research online or browse the inventory in person). Finally, the staff even offered me lunch and unlimited free beverages while I was waiting for the vehicle to be ready and waiting to sign the contract. I would recommend Allen Hyundai and Aaron Vega.",5.0

The list of screw ups are quite extensive from improper installation of my entire dashboard, promising loaners that magically were not available the day of service, sending coupons at one price and charging another, recommending unnecessary oil changes at 3,000 miles (Factory is 7,500), leaving garbage and dirt in my vehicle along with scratches. 

I've reported my displeasure every time with either a service advisor and/or the service manager only to get excuses of having new service advisors, construction taking place, manufacturers fault not the dealerships. 

Please save yourself the time and stress involved and take your vehicle somewhere else. ",1.2
502,"June 01, 2016","After visiting many dealerships or doing online applications and they tell you to come in because they can help you. When you get their you continue to  hear them tell you the same story just like the rest. Your car has a lot of negative equity so try back in 6months to a year. When I came to Allen Hyundai and I spoke with Kelley she made me believe. This is when everything changed right in front of my eyes. They were able to take my trade in with the negative equity and get me in a car that I could truly afford. It wasn't something that I was looking at when I got there but it's a start to help me so I can rebuild my credit and get back on my feet.

Bought a Sonata here, limited Hybrid with the Ultimate package.  Love the car, price was average for the market, Hershel was accommodating and followed-up appropriately.

They are replacing the key for me at my convenience and were nice enough to schedule my first free oil change.

Upon completion of my survey about the dealership, I was contacted by my salesperson.  He was upset and accused me of being confused about my own experience, told me how the things I listed in the survey were not his fault and how this was now going to hurt him financially because it will lower his score.  I'm not sure how all of that works, and it's unfortunate that he will be impacted financially, but his response was unprofessional and I was really upset upon receiving the email.  I have followed up with the service manager and the GM of the dealership and are awaiting a response, but be forewarned about what you put in that survey, it may evoke an emotional response.

Go straight to Allen Hyundai and get the deal of a lifetime with people who listen to your needs and make you feel like royalty!

598,"February 26, 2016","How often can you honestly say you had a good experience at a dealership?  We just did.

I've purchased cars at Allen Hyundai in the past and returned because I've only had good experiences working with them.  With my latest purchase, they didn't have the exact vehicle I was looking for but they said they would get it and have it ready and waiting for me.

They were true to their word.  When I arrived at the agreed upon time, the car was waiting for me washed and with a full tank of gas.  I was in and out in about 45 minutes.

I had a minor issue with the car and they were able to resolve it to my satisfaction as they had promised.

The next time I'm looking for a Hyundai, they will be the first dealership I contact.

But, I have always had my eye on their Elantra's, but I knew that when the time was right, I would get that style and model that I wanted.
So 3years passed, and I was due for an oil change as usual.  I got an email that morning that my 3year anniversary with my Accent was coming up, and that is when I thought, ''what if'' it was possible trading in this 2013 Accent for a 2016 Elantra?... well, after a long 5-6hrs of ALOT of patience, kindness, & the team working VERY hard to get me into this new 2016 Elantra SE, they made a way for me to drive home in it that day!
I cant tell you enough, how kind, helpful, and wanting they are to see you happy and satisfied, as long as you work with them in all honesty. Im forever satisfied, and will always come here to purchase a car! I'M NEVER going anywhere else!!!- and I would suggest anyone to get their car at Allen Hyundai and stick with them, as they are the best and actually loyal to their customers!
The service, the genuine team, the prices, the quality of their cars earn a '' A+++"". 
I cant wait to see everyone again when that time comes, or just for an oil change, as they are my Family :)",5.0

605,"February 17, 2016","My son was the one who told me to check out Hyundai as we were driving to different dealerships and getting an idea of what I wanted. I have been in real estate for 20 years so I drive a lot and want something that is comfortable and reliable for myself and my clients.
As we were driving my son told me to make a right hand turn onto Camino Capistrano so we could take a look at the Hyundai dealership. When I got out of my car I was greeted by a gentleman name Rick Taylor ho has since retired. Rick was one of the best salesmen I have every had the pleasure of meeting and working with and he listened and accommodated me in a way that made it easy to make my choice to buy a Hyundai.
That was my first experience and when I found out that Rick had retired I was disappointed but he actually called me to tell me he was retiring and told me that when I was ready to trade in my car for another that Hershel Will was the man to go to.
Long story short Hershel must be a clone of Rick Taylor because I received the same great service from him that I did from Rick and to dispel the old adage of "" Having to deal with a Car Salesman"" no longer applies and could not be further from the truth! 
I am very happy with my Genesis I just purchased from Hershel and he spent the time and was very patient with me as it took a couple of months running down a car that I really wanted and he found it for me!
Thanks to Hershel and don't want to forget the finance gentleman David as he was great too!!
I plan on returning for my third purchase in a couple years.

620,"January 17, 2016","I had my first service done on my 2016 Tuscon and several issues with this particular site, which was my first time as well:

1. Standing right at the counter and of the three working the counter talking amongst themselves, it took five minutes or more before I was even acknowledged, at this point I am a little annoyed, but it's doable and I can deal with it.

2. I question the knowledge of the workers a little bit because my ""factory set"" service indicator is set at 7500 miles, well I am told no absolutely not, it should be 3000 miles and you went over that by a longshot..., you will void your warranty if you go over that, (lie) ...now, if you pay double and get full synthetic you can go about 5000 miles...*sigh* whatever...When my car is finished the technician tells me be sure to have your oil changed every 3000 miles so you don't void your warranty....wth! This is not correct people. The factory set my vehicle up at 7500 miles, and I understand that synthetic is best for the motor, but do not feed me a line of crock so you can get me to come back more often so I can pay you to put high grade oil in my car that costs double, I am not new to this scene! Now I am a annoyed...

3. Whichever one of the technicians that stunk up my brand new car with your foul funk  ( two days and it is still present!!!) and spit out the window of my car and completely missed and it all went down the side of my car....you are absolutely disgusting sir. I have NEVER had that issue before and I am rather surprised they would be so unconcerned and careless...now I am just angry....

628,"January 07, 2016","My 2015 Hyundai ECO purchased January from another dealership was bought back by Hyundai Corporate.  They told me I could go anywhere, so I chose Allen Hyundai as we had  a very good experience purchasing our first Sonata at Allen back in 2011 (the ECO was purchased elsewhere).

Hershel Will met me to discuss a replacement vehicle, and I settled on the Limited:  A) to avoid the Eco's experimental transmission problem and B) they were dealing on 2015 model holdovers.

My experience with both the buyback procedure and the new purchase could not have been smoother.  Start to finish, we were in the building less than 2 hours.  The Finance Manager had all the input for the new car, and we spent more time with Hershel outside talking about the added features of the Limited versus my old car.  Add to that Hershel' helping new salespeople learn how to ensure the Customer's familiarity with the safety and comfort features of their product gave me the assurance I chose the right Salesperson for the job.

KUDO's to Hershel Will, Brian Carpenter in Finance, Josh Bashor & Elise Ranauro in Customer Support, Celia Huerta & Mark the inspector for MORLEY vehicle, and my main man MIKE VILJAK of Hyundai Western Regional Support.   I was very pleased with the new sale and the buyback taken place at Allen Hyundai of Laguna Niguel.

690,"October 08, 2015","If you're like me, you generally hate going to car dealerships. That's part of the reason why I hung on to my 2003 Hyundai Sonata for 12 years (that, and it was a very low-maintenance car for a very long time). Like all good things, though, my time with that car came to an end, and I decided to get a new Sonata Hybrid. I met Alex on the lot, and he took the time to listen as I explained what I was looking for in my next car, and what my budget would be like for it. He was very accommodating and easy to work with, as I felt absolutely no pressure to say yes to a deal that I did not like. After a bit of negotiation, we came to an agreement that allowed me to finance a new car with very little down and at an affordable monthly rate. Once we got to finance, Brian Carpenter was very helpful in explaining my options for the warranty and service packages. Ultimately, this was by far the easiest car buying experience I've had, and I can't thank Alex and Brian enough for their efforts. I am extremely happy with my 2016 Hybrid.",5.0

694,"October 03, 2015","My beloved 14 year old vehicle had a minor engine fire, and when it was in the shop overnight, I rented an Enterprise Hyundai Accent GLS sedan. It was extremely comfortable seating and an intelligent interior layout with a lot of cargo room and attractive body styling.
Over the next days I did a lot of research on that model, and made a decision to purchase new - it was time - on behalf of the issues with my previous car a week earlier.
 I went to the Auto Trader online site and plugged in the needed details to whittle the selections to the specific car/color I had decided on. There were 2 new 2015's to consider in my locale, as I was on the later edge of the previous year being sold out for 2015 - and being replaced by the new year model for 2016. One was slightly less money but double the distance from home, so I chose the closer dealership, Allen Hyundai in Laguna Niguel, CA,  and paid a visit 2 days ago. 
Upon meeting my salesperson, David Stea, I told him that I was going to buy a car that day, and was hoping it would be with him. David is seasoned in many aspects of car dealerships over a 34 year career and loves his job. We wasted no time in locating the car I had chosen online, had a test drive, and a conversation about price (I chose the new 2015, and received a savings of $2,100 under sticker with no push-back whatsoever from management or sales person when I asked for an additional $200 below the already low clearance price that was advertised at $1,900 under sticker on Auto Trader), 
The finance manager, Brian, was concurrently sifting through a dozen loan options to find me one that kept payments lower than I had anticipated. 
All of this was accomplished in the first several minutes after arrival. 
The car was beautiful, exactly what I was looking for, with a 100,000 mile warranty and 38 MPG, the salesperson was sharp and expedient, the price was excellent, and the entire staff was clearly interested in the experience being a good and respectful one from beginning to end. 
David offered to drive my new car to my home, since I did not have a trade-in, and I gave him a quick lift back to the dealership, and we were done. 
Simple, fun, and a happy and memorable experience for one of the 2 biggest purchases in most people's lives. 
I would recommend this group without any hesitation. Thrilled!",5.0

I have a big peoblem with the $400 fee i am expected to pay when i turn in this car at the end of the lease. I was told that this fee will be waived should i lease or buy another car from The dealership. What is that all about?

The Elantra satisfies all of these. My family also rented an Elantra for a separate reason, and from a separate place. Riding around in it helped me decided I wanted one for myself. 

The Allen dealership told us all we needed (or at least wanted) to know about the car. I also went to other dealerships to look at other cars. The biggest con I observed with those places is their LACK OF CUSTOMER PARKING relative to the size of the parking lot. These were huge parking lots where ~99% of parking spaces were occupied by lot cars. BAD DEALERSHIPS. BAD!

786,"May 14, 2015","I have so many wonderful things to say, I am not sure where to begin!
Being 76 and wanting to drive something really special, I began my search visiting many local car dealers.  I had a good idea of what I wanted and what I could afford.  I narrowed my search down to 3 makes and models.  Hyundai was the third car I researched......I saved the best for last!!
I went on line and Elise was the first person I touched base with.  She was wonderful, and I told her my needs and she assured me that Allen Hyundai would see that my wishes  would happen.
Later that day, Trey Ross entered the picture.  I have NEVER dealt with such a wonderful, patient, informative and caring person like Trey in my entire life.  He asked my needs, wants, and was able to answer all my questions.....and there were many!!  Needless to say, I had much to learn and he took the time to explain everything, searching for my new car.  Of course, like any other female, I changed cars, from the Sport Sonata (which was awesome) because I tend to like bells, whistles, and some glitz, even at this age!.  Enter, a beautiful silver Sonata Limited.  My dream car!  At this point in time,  Blair Morrison came into the picture along with Brian Carpenter...........this wonderful team of people worked together to make it all happen for me.  They searched every option and all the time considered only one thing.........ME!
When I started this search, and having to do it alone, I dreaded it, as my former experiences with any car dealership were nerve wracking and took a toll  on my nerves.  I am also an East Coast transplant of just 3 years...........and did not know where to begin my search, nor did I even know what the results would be.
The employees at Allen are unique and amazing.  THEY REALLY CARE!!
I absolutely love my new car, and because of the team of gentlemen who saw that,  I was able to get my beautiful new car, I am beyond happy.  I totally enjoyed those appointments (and there were many)  watching them work together, for me, and I can never tell you how much I appreciated that.
At the risk of this turning into a novel.......(a best seller I am sure), I will close with a huge thank you, and so much gratitude straight from my heart.  
I am actually looking forward to my service visits, so that I can pop in and say hello to my new friends!
Thank you Trey, Blair, Brian and Elise!!!!!
Thank you Allen Hyundai for such a caring team of people!!

I went it to look at cars not knowing much about the Hyundai brand. Trey took the time to show me all the cars I wanted to see and even test drive them, even though I told him I was just looking and not interested in leasing or buying anything. He was very professional and my favorite part about my whole experience is that he wasn't Pressuring me to buy anything!!!! After I decided to lease, he took the time to explain the whole process and kept following up with me for a few weeks (again with no intention to pressure me into buying). The whole lease process was super fast and the even the finance manager Brian Carpenter was awesome. He had all my paper work ready for me and had me in and out super fast.

788,"May 12, 2015","My wife and I were so pleasantly surprised at how the Allenn Hyundai personnel, from the web-support to the final closing of the deal people, did so much to educate us and to really meet our needs. We did not want all of the bells and whistles, like navigation, etc. Hershel immediately began to look for our car with other dealers to make a trade. We made additional requests as we found additional options we desired' such as the auto-dimming rear view mirror' which Hershel immediate added to his search' without question. 

This was in stark comparison to another dealer we visited to have a comparison and check on price. They tried to push what was on their lot. They offered extreme discounts to take one with navigation plus other items we did not want. They tried to push their demo with a different color, but with a bad scratch on the drive's side mirror' which they would fix. They told us they could only find one car with our desired features, but never really looked. (I checked their monitor and saw nothing.)

We finally decided that the extra discount was not worth it. With Allen we felt a high degree of trust which bore out when we made the final deal. Hard to beat the comfort fealing we felt in dealing with Allen. Go with Allen Hyundai!",5.0

He, as with Shant was assertive, not pushy and professionally provided us with various options that we could have added at that time or could add in the future.

This latest experience of purchasing my 2015 Sonata was smooth from beginning to end.  Went onto the website, filled out the form, and before you could say, ""Sonata"", Elsie was giving me a call.  I asked Elsie serveral question re cost and financing, she said she'd get right back to me with the answers and before I could say ""Hyundia"", she was calling me back with the answers I needed to help me make my decision to move on to the next step.

I showed up the next day and met with Doug, ""Mr. No Pressure"" Lincoln.  He pulled up the car Elise and I had talked about, we took the test drive, had all my questions answered and not to much later I was pulling off the lot with my brand new car.

Allen Hyundai is about an hour drive from where I live, so I compared the environment, attitude, and offerings of a couple of local dealerships.
