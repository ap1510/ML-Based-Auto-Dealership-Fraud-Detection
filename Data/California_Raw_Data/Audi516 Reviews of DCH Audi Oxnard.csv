0,10-Apr-20,This dealer engages in deceptive/dishonest sales practices also made no effort to assist title and licensing process.  strongly recommend that you buy your car elsewhere,1
1,31-Mar-20,By far the worst dealership experience in my life. It really started with the Finance Manager and then to the General Manager (Steve Handler). Steer clear of this bogus and retaliatory car dealership.,1
2,30-Dec-19,"I took my 2016 Q7 for a couple of services to Audi Oxnard which is the closest dealership to where I live. The first service was a 10000 mile check. The second was again a regular check and an oil change and an update. Each time they needed a whole day to complete the job. I was promised to be notified after the work was completed. In both instances I never received the call but had to call myself several times to get the status of my vehicle.
In September 2019 I traded in the Q7 in for an e-Tron. As Audi Oxnard is the closest dealership I wanted to give them a chance to get my business. The offer that they gave me was so bad  that I left without buying the vehicle at the Oxnard Audi dealership. Instead I purchased the car from the dealership were I got the Q7 three years before for a much better price.
 A few days ago I purchased another Audi. This time I did not even bother to to go out to Oxnard as their selection of the model was limited. Therefore I ended up getting my A8L at a different dealership. I had problems with the setup of my Audi App and needed help. So I turned to Audi Oxnard. I should have been warned from my previous experiences! Cesar from the service department referred me to a sales person. His first reaction after me explaining my problem was to ask me were I bought the car. He was very unenthusiastic and told me only because he is a “nice person” he would try to help me. After being in the car with me for less than 60 seconds without a result we went inside the dealership to his computer. My App was already set up on the phone and just needed some more input from Audi. Suddenly he decided that his help would stop right here and sent me back to my vehicle advising me I should try myself. Of cause this didn't work as he didn't submit the missing data. I went back inside, the person that I talked to was gone, and again asked for help  in their service department. In a rather brisk tone I was told that Audi Oxnard was not willing to deal with my problem and I should turn instead to the dealership where I bought the car. Cesar was friendly but I am not mentioning the other names as I don't want anybody to get in trouble.
Audi builds great cars and I have been owning their premium cars for decades. I have dealt with quite a few dealerships and had overall good experiences. But today's experience at Audi Oxnard was so disappointing  that I felt the need to share this.",1
3,01-Oct-19,"I am still fuming from this dealership! I inquired a used Lexus I saw on Car Gurus and Larry from DCH Oxnard got back to me right away. This was on a Friday and I told him that I have to work on Sat and the earliest I can come up to Oxnard is Sun am...being stationed in Oceanside, he advised me to take the train and he will pick me up from the train station. We agreed to speak on Sun am and work out the details. I called him Sun morning at 8 am after my duty and asked him if the car is still available and I'm still good to jump on a train for a 4 hour ride and to see the vehicle and he said yes with 99% certainty. Since they didnt open until 0900 and it's only 8 he was not certain if the vehicle was sold the night before but 99% that it didnt and I should be good. So I jumped on Amtrak @0908 arriving Oxnard 1330. @1138 while I was on the train, he texted me ""I am so sorry. But they just sold the Lexus. I feel terrible."" I texted him saying that I'm on my way to him and even called him since I couldn't believe what I just read. He replied to me""I know. I am with a client now."" The least you can do is talk to me because I'm also your client! I replied to him ""I guess I catch the next train back to Oceanside. I thought we already have a deal. That's just not right"" and his reply ""I hear you. But it is an advertised car and we cannot hold a car legally."" I went and saying that not getting a deal done is part of the negotiations but not even to see or make a deal after making a trip to Oxnard is unacceptable and saying sorry over text is not right....crickets after that. 

So with that being sad, dont offer customers to take the train to you and not even give them a chance to see the vehicle. I mean come on!! I wasted a whole day after being on duty the day before and $68 of ticket for nothing...literally nothing, not even a test drive!! The only way that this deal was not going to happen was really something obviously wrong with the vehicle since I already committed to go there and check in hand! Come on man!!! I was locked myself once and called the locksmith but within 10 min prior to their arrival I was able to get in the house and I have the courtesy to call the locksmith to tell them I didnt need them anymore and knowing they were on their way, I paid them inconvenience fee of $20. ..and I'm the  customer! Tried calling to make a complaint and after 3x manager talked to me and basically sided with the salesman. It is what it is.",1
126,08-Dec-17,"I bought a 2010 Ford Escape Hybrid from this dealership. They added a mandatory security etching fee, ""Audi Pure Protection,"" of $399. On my drive home, a ""Low Tire Pressure Sensor Fault"" came on the dashboard not more than 15 minutes after I left the dealership. I called the sales rep, Armando, and asked if they could scan the OBD II to pinpoint the which sensor was bad. Armando told me there was nothing they could do.",1
153,18-Jan-14,"To be fair the dealership was fine we were test driving cars over a few months and Kevin Soufi decided he wanted to insult my wife and I over and over as we were quietly leaving. His words were ""why you wasting my time test driving, just buy something or leave"" I frankly had never heard anything like this, when all we wanted to do was try each model. We actually decided the S5 and were going to buy it. The insulting of what we could afford and he had no problem with his behavior and never said sorry. I have 100 people working for me and if I had this employee, he would be looking for a job! He threw the keys to me and we test drove three cars and he never even went on the test drive once on that day! I would call this a legal liability by a very ingrate person with zero understanding when customer says we just need to see what car we want for $60K to $70K we as customers like to be prudent. Look up the words Kevin and maybe it will help you with your job performance. Also in the future you should be careful with your recklessness and rude behavior. To the dealership I'm very sorry I was hoping this would be a good experience. 

Let's be clear if there is any more problems with Mr. Soufi after this email with my corporation email box, I will get my lawyers involved. I'm not very happy and BTW I was looking for 2 cars and he messed that up for you as well! ",1
515,10-Aug-09,"On May 24th I went with my boyfriend to this dealership and he drove off the lot with an amazing A3. We thought all was well until a couple of weeks later he started getting phone calls from Ron Garcia, the Finance Manager. He had my boyfriend provide a copy of his utility bills, pay stub and even a copy of his Associates and Bachelors degrees. We thought this was a little weird, so we became worried. Ron told us that he was still trying to get him approved for a loan. 

After hearing this my boyfriend went to the dealership everyday for a week trying to figure out what was going on. Everyday he got the run around. They said things like, ""I was on hold with the bank for hours"", ""I couldn't get a hold of the Finance Dept."" and ""I'll find something out tomorrow."" 

We spoke to Steven Dombrovsky the General Sales Manager and he was the worst. He even went as far as saying to us, ""I'M GOING TO SPEAK TO YOU LIKE I SPEAK TO MY KIDS"" and he called us STUBBORN just because we didn't want to sign another contract for a higher APR and higher monthly payments. After speaking to him we went from doing anything to keep the car, to just wanting to give it back! He said he sold our trade in vehicle to a private auction and that he would give us the trade in value instead. Even though the contract we signed clearly states that he had to give back any down payment and trade in vehicle if there was a breach in the contract. 

The only relief we got was when we finally called Audi Customer Care. They were amazing! They called the dealership to resolve the situation and by the end of the day Ron and Audi Cust. Care called back letting us know that they would be giving back the trade in vehicle and down payment. We were so relieved and finally got the car back on June 24, a MONTH later! 

Ron said that we would get our down payment in the form of a check the mail. We contacted him about once a week to get status on this. He said he didn't know when we would be getting it. By the 3rd week he said we should have gotten it by now and that he would call their Financial Dept. We didn't hear anything from him. 

So we called Audi Cust. Care a second time! They contacted the dealership and Ron called back that same day and told us that we can pick up the check. When my boyfriend got there, Ron began with the excuses and said there was a mix up. 

This was the worst experience we've ever had with a dealership. My boyfriend and I are both in our late 20's, but we were treated and talked to as if we were kids. I don't know how a dealership can run with a Sales Manager like Steven. This whole situation took nearly 2 month and only way anything was resolved was with the help of Audi Customer Care. I advise everyone to steer clear of DCH Audi of Oxnard.",1
4,05-Sep-19,"To make a long story short, I was a firefighter with bandages around my neck from a surgery to fix a fractured neck. We brought an end of lease car in and salesman Robert talked my wife into looking at a new car, I needed to be sitting down due to the neck pain, so my wife is looking at cars at night in the rain. Worst time to but a car, but Robert showed my wife a car which he said was brand new. When we went to sign the contract, it had “used”  on the top of the contract, I asked if it as used because it did have 272 miles on it. The salesmanager indicated  that the car was brand new and the used car box was incorrectly marked, I asked about the high mileage and he said that it’s from the test driving. 272 miles of test driving????? When we got home and looked at it in the morning, each corner of the car was damaged and a large oil/ grease  stain under the passenger floor mat. After two weeks of complaining, Manger Steve says he’ll take care of us. Once here they continued to lie, until Robert tells us that a lady bought and two weeks after she buys it, her husband tells her to take it back. Audi accepts it with the 272 miles and sells us this car saying it’s brand new. Robert said he saw the damaged corners and. a floor mat was ordered. Steve said he wanted to make things right and was going to give us a great deal. The great deal was that he was going to use a trade in value from the used car that they said was new and apply it to the a car my wife and I picked out. So Steve wanted us to pay him $11000. In addition to full price. So it would have been $54000. for a $43000. car.  he finally realised that I wasn’t going to take his crap and I threatened to sue he and Audi. People shouldn’t be in this line of business if they are okay in lying   I do not recommend this Audi dealer for buying or servicing. ",1.4
82,26-Jul-18,"The price was well over blue book but I decided to get the car anyway because it was the one I wanted. I have contacted them several times since the sale to deal with a couple of issues and it has been met with crickets. I would not recommend them for customer service. They just want to get the sale and forget about you. It's unfortunate because my sales man seemed super nice and friendly before I bought the car. Oh well, I guess that's why car salesman have the reputation they have. ",1.4
10,01-Oct-18,I was very close to buy a used car. I made deal with Damien for $30500 and he said he will take care of the issue with the cracking noise from the MMI display closing. We shook hands on the deal and once he find out from the service it cost $700-$800 for the parts for permanently fix the broken MMI display mechanism he step back and did not honor the deal what we just made.  ,1.6
70,31-Jul-18,"Audi service rep called left message stating if I would like my Takata airbag recall repaired if I could call ASAP so they can schedule it they only have received two parts in i called back made an appointment rep stated I could get a loaner vehicle since it was on a recall I said okay I went to my appointment spoke with another service rap he stated that he doesn't know why they told me I can get a loaner vehicle I just said okay he said we can give you a ride, you can pay for your loaner or have someone pick me up call my wife to come get me I was waiting outside as I seen her across the street getting ready to turn in service rep comes outside says that we don't have your part we got parts for other vehicles. I know people make mistakes but when the inventory parts I'm sure a specific list have cars will pop up I get the feeling that probably somebody's buddy got word that there was only two parts in and got him moved up to the front to get his car repaired first I didn't ask for anything in return but it still would have been nice if they would have offered at least a free car wash which doesn't cost them anything audi basically wasted my time, gas and my wife's time and gas. And my wife being annoyed she wasn't dressed for the day or prepared to drop everything and come get me at the dealership stephanie the service rep at the other desk was more friendly, apologetic and told me to have a nice day apposed to my rep",1.7
29,01-Sep-18,"After working out a potential trade-in deal over the phone with a wonderful salesman (Larry Ellis), we drove up 110 miles on a Saturday to get make our choice.  Larry was extremely helpful and patient, and was able to work our trade out on a very nice 2016 Q5 TDI (with 17k miles on it); this is where the goodness ends.

We started in the finance dept. with a young lady, who continually tried to pressure us into purchasing the Audi care package, even saying she ""couldn't believe we weren't buying it"" and that ""everyone buys this"", like we can't think for ourselves.  Financing is about just that, financing. All of the decisions about add-ons are the decision of the buyer, and the finance team should just stay neutral (or remain quiet) if they don't get their commission from an up-sell. Also, finance should never comment on how poor they think a warranty from USAA is; I love USAA and they have been awesome with warranty service for us in the past.

We took delivery of the car and got about 5 minutes of an overview on all of the controls on the vehicle; that part needs a little work as well. As we left the dealer lot, and our low air tire light gauge came on, so we returned to the dealership.  nce we arrived, we were greeted by Andy Sasso (very helpful) and Stephanie Trejo (not so helpful). After explaining our issue (low tire pressure) Stephanie took the Q5 back to put air in the driver’s side rear tire.  After going back and having it looked at, Stephanie came back and said the tire had a nail in it, and that we could stop anywhere on the way back to Laguna and have it repaired. I reiterated that we literally just drove it of the lot. Larry Ellis came out and said he would take it to a few local places, and see if he could get the tire repaired.  I was told that DCH Audi Oxnard would pay for the repair, once I had the tire fixed/patched.
After around 30 minutes, Larry came back and said that all of the tire stores had at least a three hour wait, and he didn't want us to have to wait that much longer before heading home; we had already been at the dealership over 6.5 hours.   Since the service team stated the tire just needed a patch repair, we felt confident enough to drive it back to Laguna Niguel and get it repaired.  We did arrive home, and parked it in the garage until the following morning.

On the following day I drove the Q5 up to a Big O tire store and asked them to review the tire for a repair. After looking the driver rear tire over (and the others) the manager called me out to show me the tires.  The driver rear tire did in fact have a nail in it, but all of the tires were severely cracked, and they said they were so unsafe, that they were not permitted to make any repairs.  I contacted the Audi DCH salesman (Larry) and told him about the concerns.  Since Larry was off on Sunday, he said he would bring it to Management’s attention on Monday.

 On Monday, Larry contacted me and said that the dealership was not going to be responsible for any more costs associated with the Q5; however, the dealership was willing to let me buy my Yukon (trade vehicle) back, and they would buy me a set of tires.  What???? I 100% disagreed with that approach, and pointed to the fact that the dealership signed off on a vehicle inspection report, showing the vehicle was safe to drive, and in good working order; obviously, not the case.
Next, the discussion escalated as I continued to pursue replacement tires, since the dealership stated the vehicle was safe, and in good order.  Larry contacted me again stating the dealership was willing to let me bring the Q5 back, and have my Yukon back (basically tearing up the contract), and negate any right of rescission - since I didn't pay for it in the finance department.  I 100% disagreed with this approach as well, so he took that back to management.  One final call back stated that the dealership was willing to come down to Laguna with my Yukon (and give it back) while taking back the Q5 back to Oxnard - again, tearing up the original contract.  What?????

The dealership has owned their responsibility on two different occasions, but not willing to pay for new tires.  What????

I took it upon myself to call Goodyear directly, since the tires only had 17k miles on them, and they were extremely helpful.  After reviewing the severe tire cracking issue with Goodyear Corporate, they agreed to have me get replacement tires, and only have to pay for the installation.   Huh, why couldn't Audi Oxnard have done this before selling the car; not a very good inspection.
I was able to get the tires replaced, and only had to pay $127 for 4 brand new tires.  I communicated this information to Larry Ellis, and asked for the dealership to pay the $127 to make it right.  I mean, you sold me an unsafe vehicle, permitted us to drive down to Laguna Niguel on these bad tires, and now acted like it was our problem; wrong.

The dealership has gone ‘radio silent' since the new tire installation, and will not own any piece of this poor inspection process; apparently mechanics outside of DCH Audi Oxnard don't know what they’re talking about.  Two tire places agreed (in writing and with photos) that these tires were unsafe.   
I will be filing a complaint with the State of California for the poor ownership of the dealership, and the fact that I had to do the legwork to get the tires replaced -at a minimal cost.  All the dealership had to do was to agree to pay the installation fee on the new tires, and own their inspection process needs work.

I cannot give the dealership (especially management and finance) any kind of rating other than poor; it was exactly that, and potentially life-threatening.  The sales team (Larry Ellis and Andy Sasso) were very good and extremely helpful.

54,09-Aug-18,"Took car for first service at 10k miles. came home and every emergency light in the car started going off. Dealer said i need to take it back to fix it. This is very difficult when you have an 8 week old and 2 year old and two full-time working parents. Plus, CarPlay in audi doesn’t work with iPhone X and they claim it’s an iPhone problem and said “oh well we can’t do anything about it.” Pretty BS to me! also they don’t have loaners available for service which sucks when your dealer is 25 minutes away from home. Meh.",2.6
142,23-Jul-15,"To start, the email they send you asking if you would recommend us doesn't actually let you select no. Not a good start. Secondly after bringing in the car for service within the same day let us know they didn't have the parts and it wouldn't be ready for 5 days. No loaner was offered or given so I ended up with no car for the entirety of that time, and as someone who is hardly home and goes places often, that was a terrible experience. I just can't understand how a company could knowing leave someone without a car for that time and the customer service not do anything about it.",2.6
145,15-May-14,"I went to DCH Audi to see what they had in used car inventory. I was originally looking for a Ford Edge, but seeing as they didn't have one that they could get in my price range I asked the salesman what they did have in my price range. He looked through his system and couldn't come up with anything when the manager hollered out to show us a 2005 Volkswagen Touareg that was on the lot. The salesman jumped up very eager to show us this car. Car looked nice outside and in, minor spots of use but nothing unexpected. The salesman and manager did their ""number crunching"" and pretty much did whatever they had to do to get us in this car. I thought it was great at first seeing as they dropped the price a bit and everything to get it in our loan range. Little did I know this car was no good. We got the car, loved it for about the first three months, ran fine and is a very strong and sturdy car just like we wanted. Went out to the car one morning and it wouldn't start. We thought we maybe just left a light or something on so we jump started the car and went on about our business. Car wouldn't start again when we left where we had gone. Long story short, I replaced the battery but continued to have the same problem a few days later. I called the dealership and asked what was going on and all they told me was ""you didn't get the extended warranty so we can't help you."" I argued with the service manager for a short bit and he agreed to look at the car but said he would give me two free hours of ""diagnosis"". I took the car and they Completely wasted two hours of my time doing something that should have only taken about thirty minutes then he wanted to charge me $125/hour to diagnose a car that they sold me not working. I told him no and went elsewhere and the car has been through three batteries and over $1000.00 worth of service and still does not start. THEY SOLD ME A LEMON! and did not want to do anything to help me. Now that I look back at it, they weren't ever helping me with price to begin with, they were just eager to get this car off of their lot and I was the perfect candidate due to having very limited loan parameters. I am now stuck with this car upside down on my loan and it has been nothing but money lost and headaches. I would not recommend this dealership to anyone Ever!",2.8
118,10-Jan-18,"Quite prompt handling of our request, still the sale took longer than desired. Sale people well organized, paperwork took longer than I like, or was needed",3.5
49,16-Aug-18,"I had to call and text service department advisor multiple times to get the status of my vehicle. I caled and found out late in the day (around 5 PM) my car needed to be kept another day. A big inconvenience. The next day I received no update on the status. I called multiple times. No response. Finally I called and spoke with the service manager who promptly called me back. 

In summary, nice oeople and the service and engine light issue was corrected. The opportunity for improvement is with communication. My service advisor was not pro-active or sensitive at all in the area of communication with me the customer. The customer needs to be kept informed periodically on the status and timing of the service work, not left in the dark. I did all the texting and calling to find out about my car. Knwoing my car would require another day should have been communicated much earlier.",3.8
102,20-Jul-18,"Dropping my car in for service was easy and I did get a loaner vehicle which was a plus. The service advisor said it would only take about 2 hours to conduct the 10,000 mile service.  I even authorized them to text me to let me know when it was done.  That was at 10:09 am. Fast forward to 6:30 pm and I still have not heard from the service advisor (call or text) so I call in and the operator told me she had left for the day. The operator told me my car was ready for pick up and she had some verbal notes for me that were passed on by the service advisor. I couldn’t ask the operator any follow up questions regarding the verbal notes so she told me to call back on Monday and speak with the service advisor. 
I call Monday and the service advisor was out to lunch so I left a message on her voice mail. I waited all day Monday and Tuesday and never got a call back. I called Wednesday a s she was out at training. I called Thursday and she was t available so I left a message with the operator. It now Friday and still have not gotten a call back. I tried speaking with  different service advisor but he had no answers because the advisor who handled my service did not put the notes in question on the service psoerwork. So, it’s been 5 days and I still have no answers to my questions and have not received a call back. ",3.8
105,20-Jul-18,"Previous visit - and this has colored my View: I received multiple notices to come in for 5,000 mile service and brought the card in with me. Your service center had never heard of this ! I had taken off work, made a special trip. It was odd and the woman not that nice.. 

Also, good to tell people who are waiting about the room with desks and outlets. First trip, I was unaware of it and it makes a huge difference.

241,28-Jul-12,"My overall experience with Mitch and the Audi dealership was good.  However, Since I purchased a used vehicle from Audi, the old owner had not provided both keys for the vehicle.  After several months and numerous calls to Audi, they finally replaced the second key with a new one.  When I asked why it took long and why it took so many calls to Audi to get a second key, I was told that someone had ""dropped the ball"".  I was assured that eventhough the second key had been replaced, the old owner would be contacted and I would get that key.  Almost ten (10) month later, I have not heard from Mitch or Audi, other than being asked to rate the dealership.  I have not yet received the third key as I was told.  I clearly understand that Audi had met their obligation to me to get the second key replaced, but I never should have been told I would get a third key, then not hear from Mitch or Audi again.  AS in the beginning, Audi has had a difficult time meeting their word to me.  If it was not for my persistent calls, I would have never received a second key as promised.  And again, Audi is not living up to their word on the third key. ",4.2
200,26-Nov-12,"Mitch was very helpful. I had done my homework and knew which car I was interested in. Upon arriving, Mitch was quick to get me to the car and let me look and ask questions. His no-pressure style was a great help to let me look at everything I wanted to without distraction. This carried over to the test drive, where just idle chat was not intrusive. Overall this experience was the singular best I've had at any dealership. It was truly enjoyable. Thanks Mitch!",4.5

90,24-Jul-18,"I have worked with both Stephanie and Bill in service but recently there was a mixup with my newly acquired used Audi.  It had not been smogged before I purchased it and the tags were held up due to that error.  I called to find out why I had not yet received my tags (7 wks later) and I was told that the car needed service before that could be completed and she asked if anyone had called me.  Nobody had called me to inform me of this and that upset me.  I should not have had to inquire about the tags.  I had a service appt for my other Audi that day so I called Bill to let him know that the new car needed attention.  It was a VERY busy day in service but Bill managed to get the car in and smogged while I waited.  He was working alone that day so he was being pulled in all directions but he never showed the stress that I know he was experiencing.  I also feel that without his attention, I would have been a bit more upset with this problem.  Bill also was very patient and helpful in guiding me what needed to be fixed first on the older Audi.  I do hope you appreciate Bill and let him know what a valued employee he is as I was ready to drive to another Audi dealer when this occurred.  Bill is always very courteous and detail oriented.  I am sure that I am not your most valued customer but he makes me feel like I am.",4.6

433,26-Jul-11,"The DCH AUDI OF OXNARD TEAM deserves recognition and a big pat on the back as far as I'm concerned. Not only am I going to refer friends and family over but I also have to say that everything I requested when I arrived just about came to be. The choice was 2 different vehicles and I realistically didn't go for the high end vehicle but choose the sensible vehicle, one that my family could enjoy as well. Ultimately the DCH TEAM understood my situation with my ""No money down request,"" however we agreed to put some funds down and the management gave me some additional time to bring those funds in because they knew I had been in accident and was waiting for my settlement check to arrive. They even allowed me to walk off the lot without giving them a post dated check to hold onto, so long as I get them the down payment in a few weeks or so. In closing let me say thank you from my The Nagl Family and I already know where I'm going to purchase my next vehicle...you guessed THE DCH AUDI OF OXNARD TEAM.

461,26-May-11,"    Our experience with DCH was very pleasureable.  We found our vehicle online and placed a call to DCH at that time.  We were connected with Mitch Mayenschein who greeted us professionally and provided directions to DCH.  Once we arrived there, Mitch again greeted us professionally and spent a great deal of time with us providing us with detailed info on the vehicle we were interested in.  We went for a test drive with Mitch and all the while he discussed the DCH dealership with us.  Once we returned to the showroom, he worked with the sales manager on our behalf and was able to reach an agreement that was satisfactory to both parties. Based on this experience, We highly recommend this dealership.  
     The reason I submitted a response of ""OK"" to the question regarding quality of workmanship is due to an issue I recently discovered.  At the time of purchase, we noticed that one of the rims had curb/gouge damage on the outer edge. Of course DCH made the repair and at that time, (subcontracted)and the repair seemed acceptable.  However, since that time, I have gone over the vehicle with a fine tooth comb and detailed it.  I subsequently discovered that the repair was not up to par.  The paint did not match the rest of the rim as well as it should have and also was not blended in properly, leaving a noticeable edge where the paint ended. Hopefully, the subcontractor has improved since then or replaced as a result of their sub-par level of expertise.          ",4.6

14,15-Sep-18,"Bill was very friendly when I brought my Q3 in for its first service. He was knowledgeable and professional. When I got my car back, it was sparkling and clean. I truly appreciated that!

The only thing that took away from my experience was that several staff (two desk staff and one service staff) were organizing their workplace video challenge for the day. I personally found this irritating as it caused them to ignore the fact that a client was present. When I went to pick up my car approximately 5 hours later, the same three staff were chatting again. This time, I needed to approach their desk for help and stood there for several moments while they ended their chatter and noticed my standing there. 

I am all for having fun at work; but there is a time and place for everything. For the money we pay to enjoy our Audis, I would expect more professional conduct. Bill and service staff who actually serviced (and washed) the car are the only reason for my 5 star rating.",4.8
46,17-Aug-18,"I’ve been going to DCH Oxnard for the nine years I’ve owned my A4. Bill Is always great to work with, with good communication and price estimates before doing any work. The loaner option is always appreciated as I am able to drop off one day after work and pick up the next day. 

I would recommend them to anyone in the area",4.8

Bill and Robert have done a great job informing me what is most important and the extent of the work needed.  I so appreciate the professional information as I love the old Avant and want to keep it running smoothly.  They have managed to make that happen.  Bill is always available and kind, no matter how busy he is and he is generally VERY busy.  Robert obviously has the knowledge and experience with the older Avants and that is priceless.  Thanks Bill and Robert!",4.8
67,01-Aug-18,"I visited Audi of Oxnard on several occasions.  Each time I met with Robert Belmonte.  Robert was very helpful, nice and patient!  I must have looked at 5 or more different models of Audi, new and used.  There was no pressure at all to buy, or lease.  Robert's main goal was to be sure I ended up with the vehicle that was best suited to my needs.  I would return to Audi of Oxnard, and Robert in a heartbeat for my next Audi.",4.8
86,25-Jul-18,"As a first time car buyer, the stress of this process was incredible. We had already done a ton of negotiating with not much luck on a real deal. We called DCH on Sunday and by Monday morning (by phone!) we had a deal. And Manual, our salesperson, was the best! He was great to work with - he drove out of town to get the car we wanted from their sister lot and delivered it to us! That's service! He even spent time with my husband and I on all of the functions of the car. Thank you, DCH!",4.8

I had no idea that I was going to purchase a car or be able to afford it.  I would also like to mention Damien Zegers that went above and beyond to assist Larry in finalizing my purchase.
Finally I would like to give an honorable mention to Andy Sasso for closing the deal. I had no idea the signing a boat load of legal documents could be so fun.
I would like to let whomever this may concern that your sales staff exemplifies the definition of DCH (great prosperous company).

Now let’s get that audio cable figured out!!!

123,18-Dec-17,"I recently purchased a car from this dealership with the assistance of Larry Ellis. He was incredibly helpful and more importantly honest when it came to buying my car. His insight and thoughtful questions led to him recommending the perfect car for me (which I ended up purchasing). 
Terrific overall service and the streamlining from working with Larry all the way to leaving the lot made what could have been a tenuous experience easier to manage. ",4.8

135,18-May-16,"My only experience with this dealership has been with the service department as I bought my Audi used through another dealer before I even knew this one was open for business. They took care of something for me initially and went the extra mile in the process so I have been bringing my car here for service ever since. Bill is who I usually deal with and he is awesome. People think I'm crazy for bringing my car to the dealership for service, but I have been treated so well that I just can't convince myself to go anywhere else. ",4.8

159,14-Sep-13,"DCH Audi of Oxnard is simply the best.  I have visited numerous dealerships, including several Mercedes-Benz dealerships in Ventura County and L.A. County, in search of a quality used Mercedes at a fair price, and my car-buying experience at those dealerships was less than satisfactory.  I dreaded having to visit another car dealership until I went to DCH Audi of Oxnard and met Tom Straszewski.  Thanks to Tom, he not only made it possible for me acquire a quality used vehicle, at a fair price, he made me realize that it is possible to have a positive experience purchasing a used vehicle from a dealership.  

My overall experience with DCH Audi of Oxnard was very positive.  I was treated with respect, fairness, and professionalism -- no games, high pressure, or gimmicks.  Furthermore, my Mercedes-certified mechanic, who performed a bumper-to-bumper prepurchase inspection, assured me that the vehicle I was considering purchasing from them was an exceptionally well-maintained vehicle and that DCH Audi of Oxnard has a great track record in customer satisfaction, which gave me further confidence to buy from DCH Audi of Oxnard.  

I would definitely recommend Tom Straszewski and DCH Audi of Oxnard to anyone who is interested in purchasing a new Audi or a used vehicle.

There was essentially very little ""haggling"" (which I hate and despise) because I trusted the sales guy (Tom) totally.

All in all avery satisfactory experience which I was dreading! I would reccomend this organization to anyone. On top of this the dreaded meeting with ""our financial guru"" was sharp, well prepared, fast and clear with no pushing for extra services-they were offered but not pushed.

If I am still around in 5 to 10 years time I will definitely use these guys again. ",4.8
197,03-Dec-12,"Working with Mitch was pretty easy. I didn't get the annoying sales pitch hassle. It was straight to the point and better yet he was able to deal with me on the phone for most of the paperwork which made my life a lot easier. He also made special accommodations to get the car ready earlier than planned. Overall, Mitch was very easy to work with and seemed to really care about his job and making sure that the experience was as smooth as possible.",4.8
205,05-Nov-12,"We started our search for a car during the summer this year. A friend mentioned about Audi Oxnard (he bought his Q5 this year)so that is where we started our search. we are actually eying for a Q7. Our 1st day at the lot we were met by Mitchell. At no time I said to my wife that he is the type that is different from other sales rep. Nice, friendly easy to talk to and very knowledgeable of what he is selling. he presented to us what we really need to know at that time. He is courteous that he gave services to the extent of calling and emailing me of lots and lots of options that might cater to what we are looking for. He is also persistent in follow ups. Tho' at one time we told him that our priorities changed in getting a car, yet he kept us updated. He served us well. 

To sum it up all, , the main reason that we got our Q7 at Audi Oxnard is because of Mitchell Mayenschein  - his services,his being friendly,he is smart, and very persistent. he is the whole package.",4.8
236,08-Aug-12,"We were looking for a pre-owned Audi Q7 that had low mileage and a great price.  Mitch was easy going, no pressure...the type of dealer I look for.  Mitch was concerned about our needs and making sure that the service was excellent, answering all my concerns and questions about the vehicle we were considering.  Mitch responded to both my calls and emails promptly, something that I appreciate in today's busy business world. 

Once we agreed to the price, Mitch made the deal seamless.  When we picked up the Q7, Mitch explained in detail all the functions of the various systems.  This is our first Audi and we are very pleased with the overall experience we had in purchasing this vehicle from DCH Audi of Oxnard.  Dion was helpful in explaining the financing, which was a better rate than my credit union. We didn't spend a long time in the office doing paperwork. 

Overall, this experience for both of us was pleasant and easy.  I would highly recommend Mitch to my family and friends in the market for a terrific experience and a fantastic vehicle.  ",4.8
249,12-Jul-12,"I originally worked with Robert Belmonte in looking for a large sized sport sedan.  During my experience with Robert he was professional and courteous - not once did I feel pressure to buy.  After further consideration, I decided to keep my sedan and end my vehicle search.  Robert had great customer service by following up with me in my preferred way of communication - email and asked me more about what I would be interested in if he came across anything.  The entire experience was pleasant.

A few weeks later, my wife and I decided to buy a SUV.  I called Robert and went to look at a 2011 Ford Escape Limited.  After looking at the vehicle, I again left the dealership without intent to purchase and without unwanted pressure from the sales team.  Later that week I called Robert Belmonte on his day off; he answered and was excited that we wanted to buy the Ford Escape.  He instructed me to ask for Robert Duarte.  Robert Duarte was very friendly and treated us great through the rest of the buying experience.  

I have purchased over 20 cars, and by far this was my best experience.  They even followed up with me after I left to get me a lower interest rate.  

Thanks Robert D and Robert B.

305,17-Apr-12,"Our experience at DCH Audi in Oxnard was exceptional.  These guys definitely know their stuff.  Usually, I do a lot of investigating on the car model I'm interested in before I hit the showroom or perform a test drive.  Quite often, I know more about the car and its features than the salesperson actually does.  Not the case with Robert Duarte!  I was impressed with his level of knowledge and expertise with the A6 model, which included full knowledge of all of the telematics/audio/navigation and MMI systems.

During our first visit and test drive, Robert rode with us.  When we returned the following day for a second drive we were allowed to take the vehicle out on our own.  We took about 25 minutes on that second drive, which gave us an opportunity to really get a feel for the car.

Getting the deal done was easy and after they prepped the car, Robert spent about 45 minutes with us going over the various features of the car.  This was very helpful, in that there's a LOT to learn.  And even though we kept him there an hour and a half past his scheduled workday - at no time did we feel rushed or as if Robert was itching to leave.

The only reason I marked ""good"" on the price rather than ""great"", is because I didn't get the bottom line on price I wanted (which rarely happens anyway).  But we came to a price that, I believe, we both felt good about - which made it a good deal for all involved.

I'll report again after we take the car in for its first service visit.

Thanks Robert!

I called on the phone and was able to talk to Robert Duarte, who sent me a CarFax report and video of the car immediately. When I was ready to negotiate over the phone, since it was actually a distance away from me, he was able to offer me a fair price for the car. My friend and I took the train to Oxnard, where he picked us up and was polite and professional from the start. He had put in a full tank of gas, had the car cleaned and detailed, and took me on my test drive. He waited patiently while I decided, and treated me as if I was an important buyer even though I was interested in a much cheaper car than an Audi.  When I agreed to buy the car, the process of signing the paperwork could not have been easier, and I thanked the manager for making the process so easy.  I had an overall extremely pleasant experience at DCH Audi of Oxnard, and would not hesitate to go out of my way to buy from them again. ",4.8

Mitch was very helpful and worked with me to get the exact car I wanted at good price. He was not the usual cars sales person I had experienced in the pass. The car was at the port so I had to wait for the car to be delivered to the dealership. I asked many questions about this process and Kenny overheard me from his office, came out and assured me the car would be there within the week and if necessary they would deliver it to me. True to their word, they delivered the car to me and Mitch made an extra trip to go over the features. This was extremely helpful. This dealership is very unique and I will recommend my friends.

Bill knows his Audi's - there wasn't any question that he couldn't answer. Bill was very patient and helped us get through the buying process quickly and as painless as possible.

I knew the exact preferrence of the car I wanted to purchase, which was not available for several weeks - during the course, Tom touched base with me several times to ensure the car did not sink to the bottom of the ocean. When the car did arrive Tom called and announced the car would be delivered to me by Roger - the gesture was greately appreciated (not only because of the rain).  ""You can't teach an old dog new tricks"" and Roger was patient the next hour it took to explain the essentials of my new vehicle.

One of the things I appreciated about the sales rep (Robert) was that there was no hassle or pushing to sell a car. There was good dialog between the two of us.

479,21-Nov-10,"Forgive me for writing a lengthy review, but I do believe is helps to paint the best word picture for those who actually read them, including the people at DCH Audi of Oxnard.

Being in the market for a commuter car (diesel/hybrid high mpg) I did a fair bit of research online.  I had narrowed my choice to two cars, a VW TDI or Audi TDI (zero difference in overall engine and MPG in my opinion and in no way a pretentious as a Prius).  With a Jetta GLX to trade in, I did now about VW, there history, and the overall quality of the cars made by the company.  With the price comparison between the two I did take a look at the Jetta TDI “Cupetition” first.  I personally liked the car and its more sporty nature than the normal TDI.  The big advantage being the price, with the manual transition as a huge disadvantage (needed an auto/DSG car).
After a while I talked to a co-worker about DCH Audi and how they have progressed, being a relatively new addition to DCH in Oxnard.  While they couldn’t recommend them enough, I did take a trip to the Rusnak group in Westlake (down the 101).  While I did get much improved service over Barber VW, I was not impressed with the friendliness.  To me I did get an impression of “anyone who’s anyone comes to Rusnak and we know that” attitude.

After a couple of months I went online to DCH’s website.  While all the usual stuff is there, inventory, maps, etc; I was very pleased to see the team of people and their profile online.  So knowing they had TDIs I took a trip to check out the A3 TDI.

The first person I met was Jeff Macgregor (sales).  He was and is a great person and salesman.  Approachable, friendly, knowledgeable, and a whole other mess of positive adjectives describe him.  Even if I did not buy a car from him and DCH, I would implore you to go there and talk to him.  You might just walk away with an Audi key in your pocket because you wanted to.  Demo was awesome, test drive was great (love the S-line suspension and brakes), and Jeff was explaining everything along the way.  Not just the MPG, but knowing I compared a VW, all the other accoutrement that went with an Auid, the fit n’ finish, MMI, comfort, quality, and the Audi service.
Needless to say, I wanted the car.  But Jeff did not pressure me.  He respected that I needed to get “the boss’s” take and feel for the car.  With zero pressure and positive impression in my rear view, I was back later that day for a second test drive with “the Misses”.  Again everything was the same for her, and I cannot speak highly enough about Jeff’s service and professionalism.

So, very open to the idea of owning or leasing one, Jeff very casually started to price out the car.  Now here is where I think Jeff split from everyone else I’ve ever dealt with in buying/looking at a car.  He made us feel like he was on our side.  Not just by saying that, but his demeanor, his intentions, and his logic all resonated with me that he knows we want this car for a certain price and he was going to do everything to get it for us.  After a couple of back and forth discussions, we agreed on a price.

Again the difference in the hand off with DCH Audi.  Jeff did not just turf us to the finance manager Kenny Thompkins, but did a good job of transitioning over to the whole “signature” phase.  In my mind I was looking for the “good cop, bad cop” between salesman and finance, but there was none.  Kenny was great.  He is super nice and friendly, and took his time to explain everything I was signing and made sure to answer any questions thoroughly.

Now that I have my car, I love it.  Over the next couple of days there were some items that I wanted to get addressed (1. They lock the CD/DVD player so you can’t eject the Nav DVD on the A3 MMI 2. The audible beep leaves me with a ring in my ear when the car is armed in the garage) along with having the MMI setup by a pro.  So here is where my concerns about DCH come through.  Roger Heikkinen, the “Delivery Coordinator” seems awkward to me.  The MMI is a great system with a wealth of ability, Roger was able to do things I could do after reading the manual.  I was expecting a couple of hours of setup, discussion, programming, Q and A, and I got 10 minutes of Bluetooth setup, and programmed home in the GPS Navigation with no knowledge of how to eject the CD/DVD.

Roger was courteous and willing to open all the A3s with MMI to see if their CD/DVD ejected, but I dislike the “I’ve never seen this” answer.  Being an engineer and a manager, it’s those questions we should all expect to have asked to us.  Both Roger and Chase Dunning were helpful and did take my info do and promised to look into and inform the service people, which they did and I thank them for that.

When I got a call from Audi about the CD/DVD eject from Bryan Buenger, I was immediately comforted.  He seems to know exactly what to say to assure me he was taking care of it.  That was just what I needed to get over the “what if” about buying the car.  One comment to Bryan and any of the technicians, please figure out how to disable the audible alarm beep when I arm the car.

Overall I am very impressed with DCH Audi of Oxnard.  I would like them to continue to improve their technical and setup service, but both top down and bottoms up team seemed very eager to help.  I took a stack of Jeff’s cards and gave them to co-workers like candy on Halloween.  If you want a quality car, there is no doubt you buy an Audi.  If you want quality people doing everything they can for you, there is no doubt you go to DCH Audi of Oxnard.",4.8

Each and everyone who I came in contact with treated my husband and I with so much Kindness and Professionalism!!! Our visit was two Saturdays ago to take a look who we had the pleasure of working with Larry E.  We weren't ready to buy on this day as a lot to digest. We then came back the following Saturday and pretty much spent the day driving again the 2.0 and realized it didn't have the speed we were looking for so we drove the 3.0 and it was perfect. The only initial issue was that it wasn't in the color I wanted but not to be worried the Manager-Damian got right on it and found it at their sister dealership and within 1 hour or so it arrived. Any S. went thru all of the financial paperwork and he was very thorough and kind as well.  Robert B. assisted us the entire time from start to finish and was very patient  which is truly a gift!!!!

122,20-Dec-17,"I wanted a newer vehicle for a daily driver, since the 1999 A4 was getting getting pretty high mileage. I was looking for a used Q5, and then decided I wanted a diesel Q5. I’m in North Carolina, and the diesels are nearly impossible to find here. I called several dealers around the country who had ads on Cars.com. DCH had a four year old, one-owner TDI Q5 at a good price. On the web, it seemed like a nice car, so I called and spoke with Reuben Estrada. He was great to deal with. He was responsive, but didn’t overwhelm me with calls about the car. I bought it sight unseen, based on the photos, the CARFAX, and Reuben’s description. When the car arrive in NC, it was exactly as Reuben said it would be.  I couldn’t be happier. There are some good car dealers out there, and DCH is definitely one of them. Good people to deal with, especially Reuben. Highly recommended. ",5

In particular I would like to recognize Robert Belmonte.  His commitment to excellence and customer oriented service went above and beyond from start to finish.

Damien and Ricardo went out of their way to give me a great deal and give me everything I wanted.  Gus Navarro was also a very good salesman and Doc was most kind and helpful.  Ricardo and Gus stayed long after closing to make sure that everything was taken care of for me.  Above and beyond expectations.  Ricardo is a gem.",5
137,26-Jan-16,"We highly recommend this dealer, and especially Damien Zegers!  He goes out of his way to make sure you are taken care of, and completely satisfied with everything before you leave.  It adds to the total Audi experience!  I would go out of my way to work with this dealership!  Very impressed!",5

139,12-Nov-15,"I brought my Q5 in for a scheduled maintenance. I had an appointment and there were several cars in front of mine. I was planning on waiting for my car, even if it took a couple of hours. Since I was waiting they moved mine to the front and it was done in an hour. I appreciated them doing that for me. ",5
140,20-Oct-15,"I was in Ventura visiting my family.  I truly see my battery dying as divine intervention.  First, the tow truck came in a timely manner and the 2 guys were extremely nice and professional.  Next, when my car was up, my service specialist (I believe his name was Bob or Bill) came to me and showed me how dangerous my 2 front tires were to drive on.  The genuine concern for my safety was apparent.  I was extremely pressed for money as I live and work in the desert and our ""season"" is just about to start.  My service specialist worked with me and I made it home safe and sound. 
Thank you for helping someone even though you knew I was a visitor. 

With Gratitude,

141,08-Oct-15,"Between me and my two daughters we have purchased three Audi's from DCH Audi of Oxnard. They are amazing an patient. I do mean patient. Have you ever taken a 16 year old girl to buy a car? Who doesn't know what they want? And wants to look at everything, more than once? Oh my what an adventure. Howard was amazing he took the time to explain every car and answer all of her questions. Thank you Howard, Steve, Damien and Bill for such amazing customer service.  ",5

Next day I pulled in  Bill prepared  paper work and tossed me the keys to a brand new A6. Service was done on time Bill explained the fine points of observations made by the technicians. My car was washed and waiting for me.
I don't think you can ask much more from a service department. Great service, great  people.

146,09-May-14,We had a very enjoyable experience & would definitely recommend this dealership. Robert was friendly and easy to work with.  Overall we would definitely use this dealership to purchase another car.,5
147,02-May-14,"The Service Team at DCH Audi Oxnard really has their act together.  
I recently came back to them (prior A6s) after poor experiences at the SB and Westlake Audi dealerships. 

DCH has a solid team of support folk and techs in place who fix things right the first time. A starting issue on my A7 which plagued the car almost daily was quickly resolved - this is after 10 months of complaints to Westlake to no avail.  

DCH also has a large enough loaner pool to support their service targets (daily service needs) and I can only say great things about their customer care and follow up. In an industry flooded by high turnover, the DCH service team has stayed solid and consistent. 

If you own an Audi, this is the place to go for service - no matter the distance you need to go. Drop the car off , get a loaner, shop, eat, golf, whatever - but don't worry because they are taking care of your Audi issues. 

Also, if you own or manage an Audi dealership, this is the place to go and learn how to do it right!  John Witham keep up the great work and team building.... Stephanie Trejo you're awesome - you're helping John make it look easy and keep it all flowing right !",5
148,04-Apr-14,I had a issue and The store Manager was Great he Called me took care of my Buying needs he made sure I was completely satisfied I would recommend this dealer they have a Great Service department they drove 2 hrs to deliver my car that's customer Service.,5
149,24-Mar-14,"My very first vehicle purchase. I've been researching since the Fall of 2013, going back and forth with Harlan Sacks getting as much information as possible. Harlan was wonderful through the entire process. His service was excellent. Honest & thorough, that's what I was looking for, that's what I wanted and that's what I got. Thank you Harlan for exceeding my expectations.

I purchased my 2014 Audi A6 on 3/21/2014 from DCH Audi Oxnard because Harlan got me the best deal and delivered on every aspect of my request, again, he was perfect. I'm from Orange County & I drove through LA traffic during Friday rush-hour to get my car from Harlan. That should say a lot. Harlan's shift ended at 5pm, but he waited until 6pm to greet my Fiance & I, and waited patiently to make sure we were comfortable and stayed the entire time until we drove off the lot after 8:00pm.

The Finance Manager, David Bedy, that worked with me was great as well. All the documents to sign, he made it simple, explained everything & got straight to the point. I've heard car buying horror stories and my experience at DCH Audi Oxnard but all those thoughts to rest.

Tyler, the technologist was extremely friendly and helpful. He got me up-to-date on all the functionality & technology that comes with a new Audi. It's a lot of information to take in, but he answered every single question, provided tips & best practices. He's very conscientious and polite.

I highly recommend DCH Audi Oxnard if you're looking for an Audi. I did and I'm very happy with my decision.

Thank you DCH Audi Oxnard!!!",5
150,26-Feb-14,"The service appointment was timely, informative, and  courteous. Post service review was helpful for follow up service to be performed. I will return my A5 for major service at 55k miles. ",5
151,21-Feb-14,"Tyler was amazing!  He was friendly, personable, accommodating and well informed.  It was a pleasure dealing with someone who truly
cares about the product they're selling.  I'm an Audi enthusiast and from the moment I met Tyler I could tell he was as excited about these
fabulous automobiles as I am.  He answered all my questions and then some.  I never felt rushed and I felt I was in the presence of a true
Audi lover!  What a great experience.  To feel like you're being taken care of rather than just being ""taken"" when buying a car is a rare
treat indeed.  Trust is the name of the game and I can say, without hesitation, that I trusted Tyler implicitly.  DCH should be proud to have Tyler represent their dealership.  It was an all around excellent experience and I LOVE my new Audi!",5
152,18-Feb-14,"KEVIN WAS A PLEASURE TO DEAL WITH. HE IS VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE AND WILLING TO WORK AGGRESSIVELY TO GET YOU THE BEST DEAL POSSIBLE. HE GUIDES YOU THROUGH THE ENTIRE PURCHASE AND EDUCATES YOU ON THE FEATURES YOUR NEW AUDI HAS TO OFFER. WE LOVE OUR NEW AUDI A5. WE WOULD RECOMMEND KEVIN AS AN EXCELLENT SALES REPRESENTATIVE.

154,11-Jan-14,"Our overall car buying experience at DCH Audi was very pleasant and stress free. We started with an internet inquiry to get a competitive pricing and avoid the stress of negotiating the price. Among all the responses that we received, we chose to work with Harlan Sacks from DCH Audi.  Harlan responded promptly to my inquiry. He is very professional, responsive to all my questions, and has good follow through. Harlan is also a good listener. They didn't have the model that we were looking for in their inventory but he worked diligently to find the model that was within our price specification. We also brought our kids to the dealer and Harlan attended to them and offered them snacks and refreshments and made sure that they were comfortable while waiting at the lounge.  The rest of DCH Audi employees (Kenny who made all the calls to find our car, Dave who arranged all the financing and Tyler who personally delivered the car to our house and walked us through all the functionality and system controls of the car) were also very courteous, helpful and accommodating to us. Overall, we really had a great experience. We would certainly refer them to our family and friends.",5
155,20-Dec-13,"Bill Profeta is personable, professional and a joy to work with. My Mom followed me to the dealership so we could do some shopping while my car was serviced, one of the salesman saw her pull up and asked if she would like a cup of coffee while she waited. She is ""still"" talking about her cappuccino!!!! It's the little things in life that make doing business with DCH of Oxnard a real blessing. If ""Mom"" is happy everyone is happy. Merry Christmas to the entire staff!!!! i look forward to my next service.....",5
158,28-Sep-13,"I thought the service I received was excellent, i never felt pressured or rushed to buy the car. I feel the they were very honest. I felt they were very friendly a couple employees came out to talk to me while i waited in the lounge area even though I'd already agreed to buy the car. They were very fast, I'd expected to be there all day but was there for only three hours I got to test drive the car quickly, I felt the negotiation was very fair like I said earlier I felt they were honest. I'd recommend to anyone to come here if they were looking for a car!",5
160,11-Sep-13,"I received the best price from any other dealership I had visited in the area.  I was assisted immediately and did not have to wait longer than 20 minutes to get pricing for a lease, when most dealerships have you in there for an hour or more.  There was no back and forth negotiation - I was offered bottom line pricing immediatly.  Kenny was great at working the numbers quickly so I would not have to wait long.  When I decided to lease my vehicle, Robert did not try to lease me something different than what I was looking for like most dealerships often do.  He was courteous and answered all of my questions.  He even took as much time as I needed to go over all of the features in the vehicle so I completely understood how to operate all of the gadgets properly.  Overall, I had a great experience at DCH Audi in Oxnard and would not hesitate to recommend the dealership or the staff I dealt with.     ",5
161,18-Aug-13,Tom was great & found the car I needed within 2 hours of our first call. The other dealership had been looking for over 6 months!,5
162,12-Aug-13,The friendliness of everyone at the dealership was overwhelming! I have never felt so comfortable and confident walking into a car dealership. I have already recommended one friend to DCH Audi of Oxnard and in the process of referring another. Kenny walked me through step by step of what I need from the car I was to select and Kevin was so thorough with his knowledge of the car I almost wanted to take him home as my chaffeur.... What a great car buying experience and I will be a repeat customer.,5
163,20-Jul-13,"Excellent experience.  Came in on a whim to see if they would trade my GTI for the Avant.  Robert provided great service and knowledge and the test drive route was outstanding.  The test drive covered enough different driving situations to allow me to discover the salient aspects of the vehicle.  Pat, the sales lead, and Steve, the finance lead were very friendly and professional.  I forgot the used car manager's name, but I had the same positive experience with him.  Thank you to all.  I've always wanted an Avant, but could never afford one; and now I have one!  An A5 is next, I hope.",5
164,28-Jun-13,"I bought my Audi from oxnard DCH audi two years ago. That in itself was a great experience, but since then the service department has taken such great care of us, always getting an appointment same day, loaner cars arent a problem and the service is also usually completed same day. Compared to other service departments locally and in LA, this is the best I have experienced so  Far. Bill Profeta is a consummate professional and an asset to your organization.",5
165,23-Jun-13,Robert was very friendly and made my first car buying experience enjoyable. He made us an offer that was hard to resist. I would definitely recommend DCH Audi of Oxnard to any of my friends. Thank you Robert!,5
166,04-Jun-13,"I had a great experience at DCH Audi when getting my new 2013 A4. I had visited a few other Audi dealers before deciding to stop in, and I am really glad I ended up purchasing here. I worked mostly with Tom Straszewski, but also with the General Manager Pat Murphy. Both were kind, knowledgeable, and honest. They had the exact car I wanted, in terms of interior/exterior color and features, and they got me a GREAT deal! 

Throughout the buying process I never felt pressured and they were quick to answer any questions or concerns I had with honest and helpful replies. All of the paperwork was completed quickly and easily and all of the forms were explained to me very clearly. Overall, they gave me a great deal on my new car and a great deal on my trade-in. After I signed all the paperwork, Tom went over all of the features of my new car so that I felt comfortable with it before leaving the lot. Tom has even been caring enough to check in with me a few days later to see how everything is going with my new car (I love it!). 

Car dealerships can sometimes be stressful places - but with management like Pat, who really seems to care about customers,  and no-pressure/honest salespeople like Tom, you have nothing to fear at DCH! I definitely recommend this dealership - and Tom especially - if you are in the market for a new or used Audi. ",5
168,27-May-13,"I had a great experience working with Robert and Steve at DCH Audi Oxnard.  If you're on the market for a new Audi, make sure to talk to Robert.",5
169,27-May-13,"Firstly, we were just looking. I had the car I wanted (an Infiniti) at Carmax was bought out from under me (an online purchase from some other Carmax) and was not really in the mood to car shop any more.

To be fair, and before we left the area, we popped over the highway to check other dealers. I wanted an Audi too so we stopped there first. We got the the lot and Kevin [Soufi] came out and greeted us. His positive attitude cheered me up, my kind of humor I guess. We looked at a dozen models before looking at a new A4. We had a quick, no-nonsense, license copy made and we were out for a test drive. It didn't have all the features I was looking for but it just so happened a CPO model had a few more. Happily we did not have to change service agents while looking at used models. I did not want to act too happy about the [CPO] car I was test driving, that is sort of a no-no in the car shopping business.

I'll cut to the chase, we bought the Certified Pre Owned A4 and I love it. I was very satisfied with the sales staff and their finance manager who knew the forms so well, it made the purchasing part a breeze.

I hope you give DCH Audi a chance, even if you are just looking... it is worth your time.",5
170,23-May-13,Will Always use DCH Audi Oxnard for all of my Sales and Service needs. I have bought 5 Audi's from DCH will continue. You don't have to travel far to get the best Audi Sales and Service. Fantastic job as always !!,5
171,22-May-13,The K-Team (Kevin and Kenny) was awesome! They helped me get out of a really bad deal and into a deal i didn't think was possible with my current standing. Thanks again guys! my whole family is happy and grateful for your help.,5
172,21-May-13,"My husband and I went to an Audi dealership closer to our home, and the experience was very poor. We would never purchase a vehicle from that dealership for many reasons.

We then went to DCH Audi Oxnard, where we worked with Tom Straszweski. Tom was low key and very knowledgable, and he made our purchase experience quite fun! Tom showed us the ""how to"" of the inside and outside of the car, and also requested that we come back in a week for a more in depth training on the car's electronics. We also worked with Kenny Thompkins for the financial aspects of the purchase. Kenny was also very easy to work with. They both assured us that when we bring our Audi in for service, we can request an Audi loaner with a few days notice. We love driving our new car and are so completely happy that we purchased it at DCH Audi Oxnard!

We highly recommend Tom Straszweski! ",5

174,13-Apr-13,"I recently had my Audi serviced for its 5000 mile warranty check. My appointment was on time and Bill Profeta handled the details so that all went smoothly. He arranged a ride for us to a nearby restaurant so we could eat while we waited. He made the process easy for us as we were in the middle of a road trip from northern to southern CA. After the servicing my car was so clean it looked new again. 

I also needed to have some work down on the wheels and Kevin Brown made these arrangements so it could be taken care of after the servicing. I appreciated that all I had to do was email Kevin and he scheduled it and made sure the job was handled well. This dealership puts the customer first. It is, without a doubt, the best experience I have ever had at a dealer for sales and service and even though I live 700 miles away I'll schedule my next service appointment at this dealership.",5
175,13-Apr-13,"When I decided to order my new car Kenny Thompkins helped me get what I wanted. He kept me informed about the production process and the schedule for its arrival. When there was a possibility I would not get the color I ordered he worked on my behalf. I appreciated that Kenny did everything he could to assist me through the process. My car arrived exactly as I had ordered it and in perfect condition. After its arrival he had it delivered to me, a distance of 700 miles, since I was unable to pick it up. He made the arrangements, all based on my needs and situation. I could not have had a better experience!

Kevin Brown brought my new car to me, some 700 miles, since I was not able to pick it up. He kept me informed during the drive and he met me on schedule. He then spent more than an hour with me, going over all of the electronics and features that were new to me. He went way out of his way to assist me on all aspects of my new car. Ordering and buying a car at this dealership with Kenny and Kevin's assistance was a perfect experience.

 ",5
176,09-Apr-13,"I contacted Kevin Brown about possibly purchasing a new Q5 back in January.  I have been dreaming of owning a Q5 for a while and knew it may be a bit out of reach.  Kevin worked with me contantly trying to find the exact car that not only met all of my specifications, but also my budget.  He not only found the car, he put up with my constant calls and emails until the car finally arrived.  He and Kenny both worked on getting my financing and surprised me when I came back to sign my paperwork and found they had gotten me and even better interest rate than what I had originally been told.  
I would recommend and have recommended Kevin Brown to more than one friend, and believe he is an asset to DCH Audi!
Thank you Kevin and Kenny!",5
177,23-Mar-13,"I highly recommend this dealership. I bought off Internet and had shipped to Nebraska. We found a transmission problem, which is common in Acura's.

179,09-Mar-13,"I am a very demanding customer. Mr. Profeta has been extremely accomodating with my last minute demands and always focus on customer satisfaction. He went to the extend to have his technicians to review the work, a Geico garage did on my car when I had an accident. 
I purchased my car with Audi Oxnard Dealership back in 2009 and the sales Department was wonderful. The sale transaction went very smooth. They gave me a sale price no other dealership would have given me. This is a dealership that deserves business and success for the hard work and great customer service, they provide.

Everyone of them played games and wouldnt or ""couldn't"" give us the deal we were looking for. We then went to DCH and worked with Tom and Kenny. They gave us the price we wanted for the Q5 and our trade in. If your looking for an Audio go to DCH and don't waist your time with other Audio dealerships.",5

new concept of complete accomodations, especially for a business lady.  They have set the bar on standards, timely service and an
immaculate facility. Kevin opened whole new ideas in order for me to have my beautiful Audi, that other dealerships had not even

186,05-Feb-13,"My wife and I just purchased an SUV at DCH Audi in Oxnard.  It has been over ten years since I have been in a dealership looking for cars and I have to say I have usually avoided dealerships due to high pressure sales.  My experience at DCH changed my perception.  Robert was every professional in the way he dealt with us and took the time to understand what we were looking for in a used car.  We purchased a car that  fit our needs and was given all the time we needed without the pressure.  In addition, I  felt that the pricing mechanism the dealership employes for used cars was very fair, eliminating all that back and forth I have experienced in the past.  Kenny lead us thru the financing process again no surprises and very professional.  Both Robert and Kenny were great to work with and helped make the car buying experience enjoyable.  I would recommend DCH Audi Oxnard and would certainly be back.    ",5
187,26-Jan-13,When I entered the dealership I was met by Tyler.  Even after telling him I was only doing research to decide on an AWD car for a lease purschase he spent as much time as I needed to expain each of the cars that would fit my needs.  He was very knowledgeble of the products and never made me feel rushed at all. I left that day knowing I'd dealt with one of the very best sales people in my 45 years of car buying.  Because of this I wouldn't hesitate to buy from this dealership when I'm ready.,5
188,12-Jan-13,"Robert did a great job. Not pushy, showed me what I wanted to see.

Finance guy (Kenny?) did a great job too.

By far the easiest and quickest car I ever bought.

189,09-Jan-13,"I am a veteran in customer-facing professions of more than 20 years now. In that time I have seen the level of commitment from companies, to seek out and add the brightest and the best to their staff's, dwindle to a very sad level of motivation. I know this because of the minimal levels of thought and consideration- evident, in the vast inconsistencies in consumer service I've received in recent years. I've seen it by observing the traits and work ethic exhibited by employees I myself have hired, with ""customer-facing experience"" in their background. Aside from the intense standard that I hold my own employees to, I have yet to encounter a sales professional like Tyler Barnett! To be (I assume) so young yet, SO Committed to delivering first rate attention to a customer is absolutely REFRESHING! I was NOT totally sold on the vehicle I was going to purchase yet. I already own an A6 that for the most part, has been a very sound vehicle. I've had some issues with it over the last couple years and the service (or rather, lack thereof) that I received from Audi Corp and the Audi dealer I purchased it from, had me STRONGLY Considering a different brand. I also, wasn't set on purchasing a vehicle from Audi of Oxnard. I picked up the phone one day on a whim and called the dealership and Tyler answered. Without selling me on the car itself, Tyler sold me on the confidence of spending my money on the car that he would assist me to find. The car that would fit as much of the criteria as I had set for this purchase. He offered to shop for me; and he DID! From the lot in Oxnard to other dealers in California! He emailed me options complete with brief easy-to-understand pricing/ financing details. He got the ok from management to allow me to deliver my down payment in a way that best suited me, in lieu of the fact that I was making the purchase under a bit of unexpected duress in the middle of the holiday season. I went in and came out of the purchase without any drop-off in confidence or excitement about resolving a transportation issue, and the natural surge in personal energy you get when making a major purchase. I appreciate the fact that Tyler is the kind of professional he has committed to being, and the fact that Audi of Oxnard recognizes it by having him on staff. ""I got a GREAT Deal""! It's such a corny cliche to reference when talking about the purchase of a car that exceeds basic need and ventures into the realm of status symbol; but Tyler through his diligence, made that a credible anecdote for me. I have a teen granddaughter that will be graduating high school soon, and I have promised her a car. I will be looking for Tyler and another GREAT Deal on an Audi from Audi of Oxnard, the moment that milestone arrives. Thanks to Tyler and the support staff at Audi of Oxnard, for not only restoring my interest and faith in the brand; but for restoring my faith in people to deliver excellence in the art of service. It is appreciated far beyond what I can articulate. Again, I humbly Thank you.

190,04-Jan-13,"Great experience purchasing my new 2013 Audi Q5, would highly recommend DCH Audio of Oxnard to anyone purchasing their next car.  Mitch our salesperson made for a smooth transaction at a fair price without the pretentious attitude of some luxury car dealers.  I would highly recommend anyone looking for purchase of their next Audi in Southern California to go to him for best deal.",5
191,03-Jan-13,"Robert and Kenny were nice, honest and got back to me In the time they promised. Robert was upfront with everything and never pressured me to buy.  Robert made me and my wife feel comfortable with our decision.  I recommend this dealership to anyone looking for a car.",5
192,22-Dec-12,"I found the perfect car online and it was at DCH. I looked on YELP and Robert Duarte had a couple great reviews, so I call and ask for him. As an ex-salesperson, I get irritated when sales tactics are used on me. I called and told him that I was looking for an honest experience without any tricks. I also told him my credit was not good. In the past, I have had dealers make me feel like an idiot because of my credit score. He said no problem, and they would work to do anything they could to help me.

So I show up for my appointment and Robert really took his time. When I arrived, I was ready to go drive it, but first we went into his office and relaxed a little. There was absolutely no pressure, I was the one who started talking numbers, I was the one who said I wanted to go for a test drive. He told me we could extend the test drive to make sure I wanted the car, but I was ready to sign up. 

Robert let me tell him what I wanted and not once pushed me. I still can't believe that I bought my dream car and the whole time I felt good! He actually made me feel good about my credit and it was like everyone in the dealership was on my side! It was like we were a team of people trying to get me into the RIGHT car. Also, I bought one of the cheaper cars on their lot and not once did anyone say anything about me looking at a different model.

Kenny Thompkins helped me on the phone and setting up financing, It was the friendliest and most professional financing experience I have ever had! 

The General Sales Manager, Patrick, also just checked in and chatted for a while. He didn't even bring up anything about the car, we were just talking about life.

I had my guard up the whole time but not one person tried to sell me anything. I usually get sick when buying a car because I feel like I am being preyed on by vultures, but this time was SOOOO different. This experience actually makes me more likely to buy an Audi in the future because I don't want to EVER buy a car anywhere else. 

It's been a couple days and I feel like I should call and check in with them because I really made some friends at DCH!
DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME, JUST CALL AND SET UP AN APPOINTMENT WITH ROBERT DUARTE!
I'll be driving my 2010 Certified Audi A4.
THANKS AGAIN GUYS!",5

all in all , tyler went above and beyond , made it a fun experience and i will absolutely return again , as well as refer all of my friends ! a big gigantic thank you to tyler barnett!! :) eve smalley

The price was extremely competitive and Robert was willing to agree on a price over the phone, draft all documents, and personally deliver the paperwork and vehicle after 8pm during the week (and we live in West LA!).  So many car salesmen are in your face aggressive and pushy, but dealing with Robert is a pleasure.  I will recommend him and this dealer to any one in the market for an Audi",5
198,30-Nov-12,Really professional. Answered every question I had and gave me an unbelievable deal... Best car leasing experience ever. Would recommend to anyone looking for an Audi...,5
199,28-Nov-12,Tom was honest in all my dealings with him.  He listened to what my needs were in finding the car I was looking for.  I got an A5 for a fair price and got a fair price for my trade in which is all I asked for.,5
201,25-Nov-12,"My experience at DCH Audi was Excellent! Kevin Brown , and Kenny Thompkins, worked hard to get the car I wanted! Kevin in particular made a personal sacrifice , by giving up the car he wanted to buy for himself , so it could be traded to another dealer, for the car I wanted! The entire experience was painless , no ""salesmanship "", just honest straightforward dealing ! Thanks again to Kevin , and everyone who worked on the deal , I will recommend DCH Audi to anyone who is looking for a great auto buying experience ! Oh and I love my TT RS!",5
202,21-Nov-12,"Tyler was very helpful and and very knowledgable about the Audi brand. He has been able to help us with any questions both before and after We purchased our Allroad. Communication was excellent and we could not have asked for a better Audi Specialist. 
Other members of this Audi staff made the financing very easy. There was never any pressure and We look forward to working with this dealership again.",5
203,20-Nov-12,"I recently made a visit to DCH Audi to purchase a pre-owned Audi A4 that I had found online.  I emailed the dealership to inquire if the vehicle was still available, as i was driving from Yorba Linda to Oxnard.  They promptly responded and stated that the vehicle was still available and they could place it in the back until I arrived, as it was a great distance.  Once we arrive at the dealership I already knew what I wanted and really just needed a sales associate to get the paperwork going.  I met Mitch.  he was not aggresive or pushy and I told him exactly what I wanted as far as purchasing the vehicle.  He knew exactly where it was located on the lot and walked me over.  He answered all my questions and made the process very easy.  I was also trading a vehicle in so there were some negotiations, but with his sales manager this was made very easy and far from frustrating.  I feel that both myself, and the dealership were happy with the deals that were made.  I do have to say that this was one of my best car purchasing transactions.  

The only thing I would recommend;  I do not feel it was very professional for the sales staff to be yelling across the dealership how many more cars they need to sell for the day.  I understand that they have quotas to meet daily; however this is not something that the customer needs to know.",5
204,06-Nov-12,Robert was attentative to my needs and assisted me with my purchase. Robert had great follow up and was able to help me out with getting a replacement key promptly and remembered that we would be moving so he called and made sure that he had the correct information so that there was no further delay in service.  ,5
206,23-Oct-12,Mitch is an excellent sales person. He made sure I was comfortable with every step of the process in buying my first new car. He is personable and a great resource for any questions regarding Audi and the auto industry. I would refer Mitch to any of my friends. ,5
207,18-Oct-12,"My experience at DCH audi oxnard was Great!!! This is my fourth time buying a car and Tyler Barnett is the most knowledgeable among all of the salesmen that I've encountered so far. He was very friendly and very helpful. He help me out with the price that I'm comfortable with. Even after I bought it, he's still helping me out with anything that I need for my A5.  If ever you visit DCH audi oxnard, I recommend you look for Tyler Barnett. He will help you out big time.",5
208,16-Oct-12,"Working with this dealership was extremely time efficient. All communication was done over the phone and email. The deal was completed within 2 hours. Kevin was straightforward with the price he could give us - there was no haggling needed - as we knew off the bat whether or not Kevin was giving us a good deal. This is probably the best dealership we have dealt with (in terms of having no personal connections) outside of our normal Mercedes dealership that we buy all our cars from. Kevin made it feel just like our experience at Mercedes, which was wonderful.

Since the dealership was 60 miles out, Kevin personally delivered the car to our office. It saved us a lot of time sitting in traffic. He drove the car into our parking lot, went through all the necessary information, got all the signatures he needed, and we had our car!

3 days after I got the car, the TPM went off and the menu screen got stuck. I called Kevin, explained the problem to him, he spoke to his technician, and he got back to me within 5 minutes. He showed me how to soft reset the screen by taking a picture of the page from the manual so I didn't have to flip through the manual. He also called me back to tell me what to do while I was driving on the freeway. By the time I got to my destination, everything was reset!

The next day, I didn't know what the wifi password was integrated in my car. I texted him and he immediately got back to me with directions on navigating the menu screen to find the wifi password. Before I knew it, I had all my devices connected to my car's wifi!

Kevin Brown has shown ""black card service"" with the purchase of this RS5. We highly recommend Kevin and/or this dealership if purchasing an Audi. I am confident that if I run into any issues throughout the years, he will continue to assist as needed. We thank Kevin for providing such exceptional service.",5
209,07-Oct-12,"This is the best Audi Dealership in the United States! Their customer service far exceeds any other Audi Dealership I've ever been to! I've been to a lot of sub par Audi Dealerships, including ones in other states to get service done on my vehicle. This team at DCH Audi Oxnard treats you like you are part of there family! I drive an extra 45 Miles just to get serviced at DCH Audi Oxnard even though I live in Los Angeles. All the Audi Dealerships in Los Angeles are over priced and provide Crappy A$$ overpriced service that sucks! I will ALWAYS drive the extra 45 Miles which usually takes an hour and a half just because of the TERRIFIC service! Bill  Profeta, always goes above and beyond to make me feel right at home! He always gives me a courtesy Audi so that I can play golf with my buddies right down the street at Saticoy Golf Course. Bill does a Great job at pretty much EVERYTHING! If you ever need to get your CAR SERVICED, this place is a MUST! If you don't go here for service your either a fool or just plain LAZY! 

BEST DEALERSHIP in USA!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Not COMPARABLE to ANYWHERE ELSE! 


A++++++++++ Service!!!! I PROMISE!",5

212,02-Oct-12,"All i have to say is WOW. Robert Duarte made it happen for me. I spent a few weeks trying to decide if i can afford the car i wanted and asked around. Robert was the only person that kept in contact and wanted to know my needs and wants. I told him exactly what i was looking for and my budget and he made it happen. He was very professional, optimistic, and worked very hard to make me happy. His manager was also incredible. He even offered to drop off my car in front of my home which worked out so good. I am in the car I wanted all along and thanks to Robert Duarte and his Manager. ",5
213,02-Oct-12,"From when we walked in, the Audi team made us feel welcome and took the time to take good care of us.  Everything ran smoothly and the the A4 runs like butter!",5
214,28-Sep-12,When I first went in Tyler approached me and we started talking about the Avalanche that I had my eye on.  Tyler was nice and his customer service was by far the best I have recieved when looking at a vehicle.  I have recommended some friends and would recoomend anyone to come in and talk with Tyler.  He was polite and worked with me every step of the way in the sale.  I would like to say thank you to Tyler for helping me get into my truck.  If I ever need another vehicle the first place I am going is to DCH Audi and I will go straight to Tyler no questions asked.,5

219,11-Sep-12,"The buying experience at DCH was Great!!!  Tyler Barnett was one of the most knowledgeable salesmen that I have come across.  He was very friendly and helpful before, during and after the purchase.  He even came in on his day off to help show me how everything works on the S4.  He is definitely an asset to DCH.  Dan Gates was great as well and a big help in the purchase.

The financing program was easy to deal with and seemed fair and easy to navigate.",5
221,08-Sep-12,"  this dealer went beyond what I consider to be normal with his efforts to make sure that the transaction of buying a new car went flawlessly...I would definitely recommend that a person looking for a vehicle new or used and especially an Audi contact Mitch Mayenschein at DCH Audi. I will say that all the folks at DCH Audi were very accomodating, from the finance man to the manager coming over and introducing himself..I will gladly come back when the time arrises to perhaps purchase again...Thanks to all  Randi Montgomery",5

223,04-Sep-12,"I had bought a previous new Audi from the DCH Audi Oxnard dealership and was impressed with their sales personnel and finance department. They were very helpful without being pushy.

It was one of the quickest deals I have made when buying a new car. Thank you Audi DCH!",5

225,03-Sep-12,"My husband and I bought a new Q5 from Robert Duarte yesterday and I can't possibly put into words what an awesome experience it was. I have never had a car buying experience like this before; every aspect of the process was stress free and easy.  We got a great deal and ended up with an awesome new vehicle. A day later and we have already received follow-up calls from Robert on a couple of extra items we ordered - and today is Labor Day! With the service we have received so far, we know we will get outstanding service when we return for our maintenance visits. Thanks again Robert!",5
226,01-Sep-12,Mitch delivered my car and spent an enormous amount of time and energy helping me to understand my new vehicle and troubleshooting phone and wifi connections.

Car buying experiences can sometimes be very hectic, but with Tom at DCH Audi, it was really simple. He was very personable, showed us all the Audi models we were interested in, answered all our queries and also made sure we had enough time while taking the test drives. This really helped us in choosing our right car. From the first visit to the final purchase, everything was completed in a breeze and we are very pleased with DCH and Tom. We will definitely be back for our next car!   ",5

234,15-Aug-12,"I can easily rate Mitch as GREAT in each of the categories.  I was very particular in the car I wanted regarding color and features and Mitch was not only able to locate the exact vehicle (when other dealers couldn't or wouldn't) but provide it a great price.  Mitch was extremely responsive at all times of day and is very personable.  He came in on his day-off to make sure the car was delivered at the right time and that things went flawlesssly.  Mitch was also very transparent with the pricing.

This is exactly how a car buying experience should be.  I would highly recommend Mitch to anyone interested in an Audi.",5
235,08-Aug-12,"The overall experience was great. I did not intend on buying a car on the day I visited the dealership but Mitch was very easy going and did not pressure me in the ways that typical car salesman do. I already knew the car I wanted when I went in. We negotiated a fair price and I was driving my new car within 2 hours. Most of that time was spent filling out the forms and waiting for them to wash and gas up the car, which is always nice! They also have a nice air conditioned waiting room with a big screen tv. Everyone I spoke with there was very friendly and they have fresh cookies too! What more could you want? ",5
237,08-Aug-12,"My entire experience purchasing the Audi Q5 was made easier.  Tyler came down 70 to Los Angeles to deliver the car, and made signing the paperwork easy!  In the past, I waited on average 6 hours in a dank office while the sales reps churned out papers or procrastinated or stalled; but Tyler was professional, informative, and VERY easy to work with.  He is approachable and knowledgeable of his product.  He took the time to show me all the car's features, and considering I am not tech savvy, I was not intimidated working the added features after his tutelage.  I am so pleased with my ENTIRE purchase!  ",5
238,06-Aug-12,"I have a personal relationship with a nearby competing dealership, and will admit, I was skeptical of experiencing the same customer service I receive at the competing dealership because of the personal tie. When Robert Duarte, spent the one on one time with me explaining how the Audi I was considering purchasing competed with the BMW, I was pleasantly surprised by his expertise, knowledge of both the Audi and BMW brands, and most importantly his above and beyond customer service. I am a overwhelmingly busy professional, so when Mr. Duarte offered to bring a test drive car to my office, I was pleased to experience a mutual sales person who takes customer service to a whole new level. ",5
239,03-Aug-12,"After researching cars for several weeks and visiting about every dealer in the area I finally decided to purchase an Audi. DCH Audi of Oxnard is by far the best dealership I have ever been to. I was pleasantly greeted by Kevin Soufi. He was extremely friendly and knowledgeable of the vehicles. He took the stress out of purchasing a car. After falling in love with an A4 Kenny Thompkins took his time to get me a great value for my trade in, low interest rate and amazing price on my new car! This is the first time I have left a dealership feeling I was truly taken care of. I highly recommend visiting Kevin Soufi and Kenny Thompkins to purchase your next vehicle! ",5
240,31-Jul-12,I couldn't have had any better of an experience with DCH Audi of Oxnard.  Kenny Thompkins was truly exceptional. Not only did I end up with a beautiful car but the ease in the process and enjoyable experience guarantees my business in the future.

246,19-Jul-12,"I bought my used 2006 mazdaspeed6 from here. I had found everything by pure coincidence, i originally saw the car in the auto trader magazine for about 15k. We were camping at sycamore state beach at the time so we went into Oxnard to get some food and other items we had run out of or were craving. After going to a Costco we had barely discovered a few days before we were heading towards the freeway while behold there was the Audi dealership with the car I had seen in the paper. We whip a u-turn and proceed to check it out. We are greeted by Robert Duarte who was quite knowledgeable about the car despite it being an Audi dealership. We took it out for a test drive, everything worked great. He was really friendly and great to talk to. We pull bak into the lot, get his card and were on our way. Compared to other dealerships i have gone to when my brother was car shopping who ask for your number too and just keep calling you trying to sell you the car even if you told them you fond a better dealer elsewhere. But i felt no pressure at all from Robert, he just said if and when we were ready to give him a call and come in. So the day I decide to head down with my dad, I call him to find out he was gone for the weekend (4th of july weekend) but he easily referred me to someone else and said to call if i had any questions. When we arrived to the dealership, the person who he told us to ask for was also on vacation so I call Robert again, he apologizes, said he didn't know that the other guy was gone for the weekend and then refers me to Tyler. Tyler was quite friendly also, an easy talker and quite knowledgeable. He was also able to answer my questions about the beautiful Audi's that i was just curious about but nowhere near able to afford. The whole process of negotiating and paperwork went smoothly. I would definitely love to deal with them again after finishing college and having a solid career. Maybe an RS4?",5
247,19-Jul-12,"My experience was wonderful. Kenny helped me find the right car, no hassles, great price. Mitch showed me all the features of the car. I would definitely recommend them to friends and family. My wife will be getting a car from them soon. Thanks and keep up the great work!",5
248,18-Jul-12,David was very helpful and thorough in helping me search for a very unique car.  He provided all additional information I requested and was very fair in negotiating a price. I would gladly do business with David DHC Audi again. ,5
250,12-Jul-12,Mitch was knowledgeable and helpful in closing the deal. He followed up with answers to my questions promptly. He spent enough time on the test drive to fully allow me to make the decision to purchase the car. My wife and I liked his friendly and professional approach to the sale. He did a great job representing DCH. ,5
251,12-Jul-12,Absolutely the best dealership by far! Everyone was so very helpful and kind. I've never bought a car via computer and phone but DCH Audi of Oxnard made it so easy.

253,02-Jul-12,"I have been purchasing cars from Kenny for the past 12 years.  I was looking at other makes of vehicles and did not like any of the sales executives I was dealing with. I was not looking at buying an Audi at this time, but after dealing with the other sales executives from other dealers, I knew I had to call Kenny.  I called him, let him know what I wanted, he got it (even if he did not have it on his lot) and I drove down that same night to pick up my car.  Kenny makes purchasing a vehicle so easy.  He is friendly, knowledgeable and honest.  He makes buying/leasing a car a good experience.  I would recommend Kenny for all your car purchases.    ",5

Totally would recommend Robert he's the best!!!!:)

257,25-Jun-12,"Tom really made my online purchase of a CPO 2009 S5 as easy as possible. I NEVER felt intimidated, silly, or dumb during the entire process, and I really appreciate that.

I had been in the market for a used S5 for almost a year, waiting for both good value and a reputable seller.  I saw the car listed on autotrader.com and Tom gave me a call when I made an inquiry about the car.  He was nice, unassuming, and knowledgeable.

Since I live in Seattle, I couldn't visit the car or dealership in person.  I talked with Tom for a couple days while learning about the car and he didn't mind if I sent him quick questions via e-mail or even text!

Finally, when I decided to buy the car, Tom helped me get all the paperwork completed and sent.  I booked a ticket to the Santa Barbara airport and Tom picked me up.  Since we'd gotten most things out of the way beforehand, I only needed to spend about 30 minutes at DCH Audi Oxnard (Kenny lead me through the final paperwork) before I was in my car and on my way back to Seattle.

Overall, really great to work with if you're buying remotely or online.  My web purchase went really smoothly, thanks to Tom's and Kenny's work.  

Just as a footnote, the dealership itself is really nice, when we first arrived from the airport, during a couple minutes of downtime I got to catch a little bit of the 24hr of Le Mans they had showing on a big LED tv in a lounge area.  Pretty cool.",5
258,25-Jun-12,I worked with Robert over the phone and email until I went to pick up my car. He was very helpful with my trade-in as well as my purchase. He made my Audi buying experience just as memorable as my previous BMW purchase. Very professional and respectful.  ,5
260,22-Jun-12,"Kevin and Kenny were very helpful and got me the best price for my car. From the moment I step foot in the dealership, Kevin and Kenny were very attentive even though my car had not arrived they pulled another exact car to show me the functions. I would definitely recommend this dealership.",5
261,19-Jun-12,Mitch really helped make buying a new car a pleasurable experience. We are very happy with our purchase of our Q5. Mitch went out of his way to locate a car with all of our specifications. We would definitely recommend this dealership.,5
262,18-Jun-12,"Excellent customer service.  Mitch went out of his way to ultimately get the car I wanted.  We had spent several months in the discussion where I was leaning toward to a BMW.  However, he put in touch with the service manager as well as the Stasis rep and ultimately provided the information I needed to make my decision.  I'm a very happy S4 Stasis owner.",5

Our deal was finalized with Kenny Thompkins who wrapped things up efficiently and whose manner was reassuring and positive.  ",5

Our experience with Audi DCH Oxnard was 100% positive from start to finish. ",5
267,15-Jun-12," We went to a few dealerships and the sale people were not very knowledgeable on the cars. Mitchell Mayenschein was able to answer all of our question we had.

268,15-Jun-12,"Kind, direct, clear, natural...friendly and honest. It is an easy place to go with good parking and a great selection of cars and colors.
 The service department is also excellent as they usually give you a loaner car.",5
269,15-Jun-12,"I was very impressed with everyone I dealt with.  I felt everyone was very honest and willing to help with any question I had.  I would certainly recommend this dealership to my family and friends.  I've been a BMW car owner for many years and just purchased a A5 and LOVE IT..  You definitely get more for your money as far as options than what BMW offers.  I'm now an official &quot;Audi&quot; lover...

The only issue I had is getting my phone/blue tooth to work.  I guess my phone isn't compatible. ",5
270,15-Jun-12,"Mitch made this visit so enjoyable. I came down to buy a new Audi and rather than the pressure and stress that comes with buying a new car he was calm, knowledgable and patient.

I would definitely return and would recommend him and the dealership time and time again. Thank you so much!

273,14-Jun-12,"We came in to replace the wife's car. We wanted a nice fuel efficient diesel. Drove the A3 TDI and gave Stan our wish list. The next day, he informed us there was nothing that matched our list, so we ordered the car. The order was placed mid March 2012, and arrived June 11. Had a tire/wheel swap & tinting. All along the way, Kenny & Rob (who took over for Stan) we very informative, helpful and pleasant. It appears they really like what they do, and enjoy helping people find the right car. We like to keep our cars for sa long as we can, and this is only the 4th new car in 30 years. By far the best experience ever!! Too bad there are not enough of these cars to go around for everyone.

He searched and found me the exact Audi S5 Convertible I was looking for. Including Color, Engine and Accessories. Thanks Kenny for all your help and hard work.  I love my new Audi!!

277,08-Jun-12,I really enjoyed working with DCH. They gave me a deal no other dealer would match. I will recommend they to my friends and family!!!!!,5
278,08-Jun-12,"I buy a car about every 36 months.  In the last 20 years, this is the best car buying experience I have had - period.  I'm a Ford guy and have always bought at Galpin Ford. This looked like a good deal and I drove 50 miles to check it out.  I made a fair offer and had a trade in; there was no silly haggling, no games.  My concerns were listened to and solved professionally.  I am in complete awe that in about 60 minutes including a test drive the deal was made, to my satisfaction.  To boot, I was given a beautiful Audi loaner while my truck was being detailed....I might add, this was a brilliant move, because I have never driven a more fun ""car"" in my life....and I've owned BMWs, Saabs, Volvos, Acuras, Hondas, etc....that RS is out of control AND luxurious...a true mechanical dream come true.  

I would like to acknowledge Tyler Barnett's great demeanor and professionalism.  Also Dan Gates, who gave Tyler the green light to close the deal without the antics many dealerships are so hell bent on subjecting buyers to.  If these two gentlemen are typical of your staff, then your selection process is ""on the money"".  I congratulate the dealership management and owners on a job well done.  Furthermore I will let all my friends and family in the market know about the great experience I had...which in this day and age is truly rare.

Thank you,

279,08-Jun-12,I had a wonderful experience buying a car. Kenny took care of us and found us a car that fit our needs. I am very happy with my buy. I had been to other dealerships but none can compare with DCH AUDI!!! no other salesperson can fit the shoes Kenny!!!!,5
280,04-Jun-12,Great experience with Audi of Oxnard. I live about an hour away from this dealership so I did most of the negotiating with Mitchell on the phone and over email. Mitchell was great and very patient with me with all the questions I had. Mitchell even worked with me on his days off to help get the deal done.  Car was delivered to me the same day!,5
281,04-Jun-12,Robert Belmonte was very professional and helpful to me on the transaction that concerned the selling of my car to the dealership he works for. He is a man of his word and is very reliable. The price I received for my used car was very fair. In the future when am looking for another car I shall positively come to the Audi dealership and see Robert Belmonte. Thank you for good honest service. Eddy C.,5
282,31-May-12,"Robert was very helpful and very kind to our Daughter! I feel like he went out of his way to make buying this Audi as easy as possible! He did everything he said he would to complete the sale! They had a problem with the shipping and he quickly took care of it by offering to refund the shipping and to pay for a ticket to get our Daughter back to LA ! He delivered the car today to her Apartment  just as he said he would and helped her sink her phone! We would buy another car from him!!

Thank You

283,31-May-12,"Robert Belmonte was a very helpful, pleasant, and knowledgable sales person.
He made sure to keep my posted on new inventory coming in, so I could find the right car to suit me. I would definitely recommend Robert Belmonte to all my friends and family looking to buy a car! He makes it a delightful experience and stress free.",5

289,29-May-12,"That was without hesitation the best car buying experience I have ever had. Kevin's response to my online inquiry was prompt, professional and he was ready to talk knowledgeably about the car I was interested in and not three other cars he thought I might like (for a far greater price tag) as had been my experience with other dealers.  From the moment Kevin returned my inquiry early in the work day to the final signing of the paperwork six hours later, buying 'Pearl' start to finish was a joy, I kid you not... I actually had FUN buying a car!

As a single woman, purchasing a car can be an exercise in utter frustration in a male dominated industry.  Not once did I feel demeaned, disrespected nor denigrated while working on the deal for my car.  To the contrary, that was a great experience.

Dion busted his butt with the banks to get me the best rate possible saving me hundreds over the life of the loan and enabling me to not only buy, but comfortably afford, the car I'd been searching for for weeks.  

The stars were shining on me that day... DCH Audi Oxnard was a dream to work with.

Thanks boys!!!  That was fun!!!

290,22-May-12,"Kevin is not a salesman...He is a now a problem solver. . His knowledge of the product is
overwhelming. He took such time with me explaining all the newest facets of the 2012..even
the fabulous radio. But his creative thinking helped me to decide to go forward..for the
tiny amount of monthly difference to take me from an '08 (which I already liked) to a 2012
which I love..was a huge innovative idea. I would encourage anyone even thinking of driving
a really stunning vehicle to give Kevin a call.  He really loves his work...better he loves
pleasing his clients..and he WILL figure out a way that you may not have even imagined. He 
goes to the top of the class...and raises the bar on caring about what's best for you!

295,16-May-12,"Awesome service and deal.  They work with you to get you a great deal and the lowest financing rate.  I drove several defferent cars and SUV's and Kevin gave me a lot of information and time to process it.  I finally made up my mind and am happy I chose the Q5.  We made the deal, signed the papers and he helped me set up for the telephone, navigation, media, etc. He made sure I knew how everything worked.  Super accommodating!  And I love the car!",5
296,16-May-12,"I found the car I was looking for at DCH on the internet.  I called ahead and they had it ready for a test drive when I got there.  Tyler went on the drive with me and was very informative, but not pushy.  After we returned to the lot, the sales staff was able to set up the exact deal I was looking for with no hassle.  Tyler even followed me home in my trade in, so my wife could sign her part of the paperwork and bought me a tank of gas on the way.  If you are looking for a great car buying experience, go to DCH and see Tyler.",5
297,14-May-12,Robert is an excellent sales person. He was able to get my financing done and provided me with excellent customer service. This is the second car I have bought from him and I would definitely return. ,5
298,09-May-12,"My Wife and I recently purchased a previously owned Infinity FX 35 that was in great condition: clean, low miles and in mint shape for an '09. 

At the time of our purchase, DCH Audi of Oxnard had several other vehicles that were very good values.

Tom Straszewski (Sales) and Dion Corral (Finance) were excellent in all aspects of assisting us with the best & most straight-forward vehicle acquisition we have been involved with.

They exuded honesty and professionalism and most importantly, were not pushy with trying to ""make another sale.""

We also felt totally satisfied with their trade-in appraisal & offer.

These guys are straight shooters and they seem to have a knack for providing excellent service.

This dealership is always going to be our first stop the next time we're out looking for a new car.

I would definitely recommend DCH Audi of Oxnard for your next vehicle purchase!!

301,30-Apr-12,"I was looking at a car on their lot from out of the area.  Stan did a very good job of keeping me informed and responding to both emails and phone calls in a timely fashion.  He even made two videos and emailed them to us to show us a bit closer the two cars we were interested in.  This helped us make our decision.  And, when it came time to purchase, he drove most of the way to meet with us (over four hours) to help accommodate to our schedule.  Most importantly, he did exactly what he said he'd do.  Excellent service.",5
302,27-Apr-12,"The customer service from Tyler was superior. He had much patience with me.

I highly recommend this dealership and Mitch!",5
306,15-Apr-12,"I went on to the Audi lot just to admire the cars out of my league.  Tom approached my mom and I to offer help, at which point we immediately made clear that I was not really a potential client with my budget.  After understanding my budget, he directed me to the A3 quatro.  He was clear, understanding, to the point, and not at all pushy.  My mom used to be in car sales, and I am personally in sales as well, and not for a moment was I off-put by my experience.  Not only was the car everything I didn't know I wanted, the price was the lowest out there, and they gave me a great trade-in value for my Land Rover.  An easy few signatures and I was out of there with a sparkly, clean, fueled, new car, a rad key chain and some great prices on accessories!  My first comment to my mom on my drive home (through bluetooth) was, 'why haven't I bought a new car before?!'  

To sum: I highly recommend DCH Audi Oxnard.",5
307,12-Apr-12,"Mitch was a true go getter from the start. We came to the dealership looking for a car that was on the internet (used) and walk away with that car. I mentioned to Mitch that I was waiting on a Q7 to come in around May, He said if he could find what I was looking for sooner would I buy it from him, I said yes. He found it and I got the car 2 months early thanks to his persistence.",5

I have to admit that I was very impressed with his professionalism and knowledge, so I test drove the A5 and then the A4 which I completely feel in love with. Mitch made my Audi A4 purchase a great experience, easy going, hassle free, and without the all BS. Being Latino, from the minute I walked in to the minute I walked out, the entire staff at Audi of Oxnard treated me like a customer should be treated and not as second class citizen. I would not hesitate to recommend Audi of Oxnard to anyone; just ask for Mitch, he’ll take care of you.   ",5
330,22-Mar-12,I had a great experience with Mitch. He took time to speak with me over the phone about a used car (non-Audi) and then made the purchase very smooth. The dealer was even able to beat my credit union's APR. I'd return in a heartbeat. ,5

Stan was very helpful, and any question we asked, the answer was at hand. We then drove a 2012 Passat TDI, and made our choice. I wanted to take the A3 out on the freeway, drive it a bit more, and see how things turned out. Stan & Kenny helped me through the whole process, and we ordered the car. Only 115 days left. Great people, very friendly, no pressure. I had to make the request to place the order. Hard to beat our experience so far.",5

343,11-Mar-12,"This is the 2nd new Audi I have purchased from DCH Audi. Even though Rusnak Audi is a lot closer to my house, I keep going back. I have gone to Rusnak several times only to find their sales staff to be unfriendly and unhelpful.  Last week I went to Rusnak Porsche to look at the Cayanne because my wife owns a porsche. We thought we would stop over at Rusnak Audi and was a little dressed down, and the sales rep wouldn't give me the time of day.  I am a younger guy and maybe they thought I couldn't afford one of their vehicles. I already own a 2011 S5 and wanted to add the 3.2 liter Q5 to my fleet. When we pulled up at DCH Audi, the staff was friendly and warm. I was well received and purchased a new Q5 that day. They were quick to finish the paperwork and got me on my way in a very short time. Later that week, I had ordered roof mounted roof racks for my new vehicle and Tom drove over to my business and picked up my vehicle to have the racks installed and returned it a short time later. Everybody was really helpful in answering my questions and the service staff including Bill are excellent. I will always use DCH Audi every time I buy an Audi and always get my service done there.

344,11-Mar-12,"We were fortunate to have Tyler assist us in purchasing a new Audi A6.  His honesty in informing us that this was his first or second week on the job impressed me initially.  He admitted he may need some help with some of the particulars;  however I could see right away that he was an Audi fan as he was well versed in their history, type vehicles and many of the options.  I would purchase from Tyler again as the need may arise.",5

Customer service was top notch, I felt very well taken care of.  They gave me a great deal, didn't try to screw me over with a high rate or unnecessary addons, and got me in and out of the door in record time.  They even found a way to not just match my credit union's low APR, but actually beat it.  We love our new 2012 Audi Q5 and are glad we went with DCH Audi Oxnard.  ",5

352,05-Mar-12,"After talking to several dealers prior to buying  my q5 it became apparent I had to look no further than Oxnard. Mitch wasn't the typical, won't leave you alone, salesmen. After our first meeting I knew he'd get my sale. He kept in contact and never ever once asked when will I be ready. When the time came! it was me that said, "" find my car,"". I will buy my next car from these guys. The first couple hours driving the Aud,i sold me for life. Not only are they a great value, the car performs. Hope this dealership continues its success for many years to come. Thanks again  DCH

Thank you Kevin and DCH for being smart enough to keep people like Kevin around and able to service discriminating customers like me.  ",5
360,29-Feb-12,"I visited this dealership twice and both occasions Robert helped me and took care of my needs.  He took me for a test drive and later assisted me with the purchase of a new vehicle.  The last 20 years, my vehicles have been ""toyota"", and I've been very satified with that.  I wasn't sure if I could make the change over to another dealership, but I did with the help of Robert.  He assisted me by answering all the questions I had plus more.  Thank you Robert!  You are a very pleasant person.",5

Robert is a great asset to your Audi dealership!!! Robert rocks!!!!! ",5

I am happy with the price I paid, I was able to order a 2012 Q5 built exactly to my specifications, and it is set to arrive on time!  

There is an Audi dealership much closer to my house – but my experience with Kevin, his direct, honest and professional service made me choose DCH Audi Oxnard!

This is the first time we have purchased an Audi and we are very happy with the style, quality and technology of our 2010 Q5 for the price we paid. Additionally, we were very impressed with DCH Audi's customer service both before and after the sale. Any questions or concerns we had were promptly and fully resolved by Kevin and the service department. We would definitely recommend this place to others. Thank you!",5
374,25-Feb-12,"After contacting over a dozen different Audi dealerships in Southern California, I was exceptionally lucky to purchase my Audi A7 at Audi Oxnard. When I called the dealership, Robert Duarte was our sales agent. He personally helped me order the exact model that I wanted and delivered it on time. After delivery, he was there to help us with every detail to insure that we were comfortable with the complexities of our new car. It was a pleasure to work with him.",5
375,25-Feb-12,"Robert was very friendly and straight forward about the process.  This was one of the first dealerships we visited that day and after finding the car we liked we still left to compare the ""deal"" with the other dealerships in the area.  We ended up right back to buy the car, it was not only the cleanest but also the best price.",5
376,25-Feb-12,"great, and friendly servive. came in bought a car for the price that i wanted and was out of there in no time. awesome experience",5
377,25-Feb-12,"I wish I could score Robert Duarte and Oxnard Audi a higher rating than 5.  I really appreciated Robert's low pressure approach.  I never felt like I was being forced into a purchase.  The team at Oxnard Audi is extremely professional and bent over backwards to accommodate me and I didn't even buy an Audi, I left with a used Nissan and was made to feel like I was one of their best customers!

Their follow-up is great too.  My boyfriend bought his care from here, I refer as any people can here and will come to Robert Duarte when I'm ready to make my next purchase.",5
378,22-Feb-12,"Excellent dealership experience.  We went to DCH Audi in Oxnard because of our positive experience at their nearby Lexus dealership.  We were not disappointed.  Our salesman Mitch was friendly, non-aggressive and honest.  We found the car we were looking for and the deal was both painless and handled without unnecessary delay.  We recommend this dealership to everyone.   ",5
379,22-Feb-12,"This was my first Audi purchase and I have been very impressed with the lack of ""sales pressure"" during my sales experience. Tom was extremely resourceful in finding the exact vehicle and options I had specified in our initial meeting. Once the vehicle was located and delivered to DCH Audi Oxnard, the final purchase steps were minimal and went smoothly. Tom presented the training on the new car features in great detail, my wife and I both felt comfortable with the new found knowledge. Everyone we met in the dealership was very courteous and professional, I know our new relationship with DCH Audi Oxnard will be one to remember.",5
380,22-Feb-12,"I just came in for an oil change and ended up buying a new 2012 Stassis A4!

They were all very accommodating and made buying a new car as simple and hassle free as possibe.",5
382,04-Feb-12,"Salesperson was very professional and did not put any pressure on me to buy the car.  

The dealership did not push any add-ons, like extended warranty and/or financing.

They allowed me to make a test drive on my own so I could really check the vehicle out.

383,24-Jan-12,"Robert Duarte is outstanding! He is professional, personable and friendly. He makes buying a car easy and painless. I am so impressed and congratulate you for your incredible sales staff! ",5
384,23-Jan-12,"I was apprehensive to purchase a new vehicle simply because of previous experiences with sales/customer service. DCH Audi of Oxnard has changed my mind. There was no high pressure sales, no haggling, no stress. Everyone was extremely helpful and made the experience wonderful. I would recommend this dealer to anyone looking for a new or used car. We were in and out in an hour and a half (test drive, trade in, financing, done!)",5
385,16-Jan-12,I went there to look and walked out of there w a new car. My experience was great and I am very happy with my purchase.  I really don't know what else to say. I am a happy camper/ Audi owner :),5

",5
388,02-Jan-12,"Having just completed my purchase of a beautiful Garnet Red Audi A7 from DCH Audi, I had to write this review to let the world know what a great experience this was. 

As an attorney, I am used to dealing with people who drive a hard bargain, and went into the dealership thinking I would be in for a battle. Not so. Robert Duarte and Kenny Thompkins were the consummate professionals, always helpful and responsive, even when I continually changed my mind about what car I wanted, and was insistent on them matching the best price I found after an exhaustive internet search. 
 
Both were poised, when they could have become belligerent, and made the buying experience a pleasure, rather than a burden. They even tolerated my three young children, who insisted on sitting in all of the Audi's, including those costing $175K, and scoffing down brownies and hot cocoa in the DCH lounge. 

As the Audi MMI system is a challenge to master, the help of the dealer in teaching how to use this system is critical. So far, so good. My first lesson with Robert went well, and I am confident he and the other knowledgable people at DCH will continue to provide the guidance I need to master this somewhat complicated system. 

Bottom line: If you are going to buy an expensive car like an Audi, you cannot do better than DCH Audi, IMHO.",5
389,19-Dec-11,"I gave a ""Great"" rating because as car buying experiences go, this was surprisingly smooth. Other than the fact that my 1st choice of color was not immediately available, although every effort was made by the sales dept. to find it. All in all, I enjoyed the Audi experience!

Thanks! ",5
390,17-Dec-11,"Good communication with Robert Duarte, was looking for a pre-owned vehicle. Their price online was great yet they were able to work with me to get me the price I wanted. All the negotiating was done over the phone, all I had to do was show up with the check.",5
391,16-Dec-11,"It was a great pleasure doing business with Mitch.  He was very responsive to my needs.

I will definitely recommend Audi Oxnard to my friends and family.",5
392,12-Dec-11,I recently bought an A4 and dealt with two other dealers in the area. The staff at Oxnard were the best and most helpful. I will be buying an A6 in a couple of months andI am convinced that these folks are the best to go back to.,5
393,09-Dec-11,"Walked up to an A6 and were quickly greeted by Tom S. He showed us the A6 we were interested in and took us through the process. A very easy and quick process, I might add. Over all a good experience.",5
395,03-Dec-11,"Customer service, friendliness and overall experience were GREAT. Thomas was very corteous and Robert was very understanding. My wife and I got the vehicle we wanted,at a price we can afford. The staff helped us complete our transaction within an hour from arriving. WILL NOT hesitate in sending customers to their showroom. ",5
396,28-Nov-11,"DCH AUDI of Oxnard had a 2011 CPO (certified pre-owned) AUDI A4 I was looking for and I exchanged few emails w/ the sales consultant, Mitchell. He got back to me very promptly via email and I visited the dealership very next day. Mitchell was a very nice friendly guy and we made a deal within about 20 minutes after test drivning the car! Mitchell made feel at home in the dealership, and also told me how the dealership seeks genuine relationships with their customers for long time even after sales of the vehicle. I had a great experience and super smoothe deal at this dealership. Besides all, my wife loves her new AUDI !!! ",5
397,19-Nov-11,"I sent an e-mail out to all the dealerships in the Southern California area, looking for a specific Q7.  Mitch got back to me.  He was surprised by the ""low offer"" that other dealers were making.  I told him that if he couldn't match it, that was fine and I was ready to move on.  However, he was very persistent (in a good way) in trying to earn my business.  He didn't make any smarmy statements like ""how can I earn your business?""  He just went to work.  He is a genuine person.  He worked hard to be competitive with other dealers and appeared to struggle to meet my demands.  Not your typical, smooth-talking, unctuous salesman.  A real, honest guy.  An added plus: English is his first language.",5
400,09-Nov-11,"My wife and I bought an Audi A-5 last year from them and we were so impresssed that I decided to get an Audi A-7 from them as my &quot;company car.&quot;  They sure tried to find the equipment and color I wanted (Red) but when it was not to be found en route they ordered it for me.  It takes some time to special order a car from Germany but they were very good about letting me know when I would probably get it and it actually came in a few weeks EARLY.  
Now this A-7 is a very, very well-equipped vehicle with all manner of electronics and Bill Profeta devoted several hours to training me in how to use the various controls. They even pulled my trade in up near the new car to facilitate the transfer of my personal items from my old car to the new car.  
The time devoted to training may seem like a minor thing, but it was a very important aspect of this transaction. If you haven't tried to use a new and fully-optioned vehicle it is much like using a new computer program: very steep learning curve - but terrific once mastered.  Bill helped get me up on the &quot;curve&quot; and I am now quite comfortable with the car. 
In summary, this is a terrific car and the dealer was as helpful as can be.  They even pointed out an Audi &quot;loyalty coupon&quot; that I could use to apply towards the price because we had bought another Audi (and still owned it). ",5
402,03-Nov-11,"I went to DCH Audi after being pre-approved for a loan with Capitol One.  I contacted other dealerships prior to DCH Audi.  They all gave me the run around and tried to get me to finance through them even though I already had financing handled.  I found a used Toyota Camry online at DCH Audi and made an internet inquiry and offer.  Within minutes I received a response from Bill Profeta.  He was very informative and very knowledgable.  I asked to come in and see the car and Bill made himself available during the evening hours for me to stop by.  I stopped by the lot expecting to  get into haggling about price, financing etc.  To my surprise, Bill and Kenny were familiar with Capitol One programs and got me very close to my offer on the vehicle I wanted.  Within MINUTES, my paperwork was done and I was waiting for my new car to be cleaned up and filled with gas.  It actually took longer to get the car ready than everything else!  While I waited I was offered snacks, refreshments, coffee and given instructions on using the remote so I could watch TV.  I was able to take my new car home that night!  I have never in all of my car buying experiences ever met a more efficient and professional staff.  Everyone went above and beyond to make my experience there comfortable and enjoyable.

I would like to note that I looked at Audi last, I was under the impression anything on an Audi lot would be out of my price range.  I was very surprised to find out cars on the lot are pretty affordable.  I wonder if that is a common misconception?

Last but not least, 3 weeks after my purchase, my daughter, a passenger and myself were hit by a drunk driver in the Camry.  The side curtain airbags saved my daughter and passengers life.  I will forever be thankful to Bill and Kenny for making it so easy to buy the car that ultimately saved the ones I love.  I have already referred everyone I can to DCH Audi and will continue to do so.  In the event my car is not able to be repaired, I will definitely come back to DCH Audi to get another car!

DCH Audi is amazing!

Sincerely,
Corinna Owens ",5

405,30-Oct-11,I have been looking for an Audi A4 for some time.  DCH Audi of Oxnard had a CPO with low miles that caught my eye.  I met with Robert and we went for a test drive.

406,29-Oct-11,"I was in the market for a dependable preowned car and a few friends had recommended DCH Audi Oxnard. I met a salesman, Bill Profeta, and told him my budget and what I was looking for. To my surprise, he showed me several options, various vehicles that may suit my needs. Thanks to his recommendation, I chose a preowned Volvo wagon that was everything I was looking for and more. Thanks to Bills excellent guidance we made the numbers work for my budget and with the help of Dion, the finance manager, was able to quickly do my deal and I was on my way :) I appreciate Bill's no nonesense, expert advice, in showing me various options in various price ranges and letting me decide.

I would reccommend Tom and the dealership to all my friends",5
408,29-Oct-11,"I went to DCH Audi in Oxnard looking for a new A4. As a frequent buyer of cars, I have ne'er experienced a purchase as easy and helpful as this one.  Jeff Macgregor is hands down, the best salesman I have ever worked with.  He provided me with a great deal, all of the information I needed on my purchase, and even went out of his way to assist me on his days off. I can say that I do not ever want to work with another dealership, nor a different salesman.  I would refer anyone to DCH Oxnard Audi.  I am one happy camper in my new A4....   Thanks Jeff and team!!!",5

410,27-Oct-11,"My new A3 purchase was very easy experience at DCH Audi of Oxnard. Mitch was a great salesperson. After an afternoon of test driving cars I had researched and being disappointed, I thought it would be fun to check out Audi. I walked on the lot without having researched or previously owned an Audi, told Mitch what I needed and he recommended the A3. After a test drive and some discussion of options, I drove off the lot with a car that fulfilled by needs and exceeded my expectations. I'm loving my new Audi! Thanks Mitch & the DCH Audi Oxnard staff!",5

Would highly recommend Mitch and DCH Audi.

Thanks!",5
413,16-Oct-11,"Bill was exceptionally knowledgeable and thorough.  Mitch was a straight-shooter -- here's what he could be flexible on, here's where he didn't have manuevering room.

414,14-Oct-11,"I came in to DCH Audi of Oxnard looking for a reliable and reasonably priced used car after being in my first auto-accident. I had received a recommendation about the DCH Audi of Oxnard location, and got in touch directly with Bill Profeta. Bill took his time to listen to my needs as a car buyer, and emailed me a few cars that he thought fit my budget and style. The attention to detail was incredible. By the time I met with Bill in person to look at cars, I felt as if we had known each other previously. He greeted me OUTSIDE the dealership with a friendly smile and warm welcome. He remembered exactly what I had been looking for, and showed me cars that we had chatted about in email. After test driving two cars, I was sold on a beautiful 2010 VW Jetta. I was impressed with his knowledge, and trusted that I was getting the best car for my needs. The purchasing process was convenient and easy; I really felt at ease with the entire staff at DCH Audi of Oxnard. Several employees took the time to congratulate me on my first car purchase, and to make small talk,  which I very much appreciated. The entire process took only a few hours, and I was soon out the door with a newly washed car and a big smile on my face. As it came time to drive off the lot, Bill once again took care to detail in explaining all the ins and outs of my new ride. Post-purchase was also a great experience; I received personalized 'thank you' emails from multiple staff personal. I feel confident in my recommendation to DCH Audi of Oxnard, and I look forward to working with the wonderful staff again in the future! Thank you DHC Audi of Oxnard!",5

419,10-Sep-11,"This dealership made me feel so comfortable when I was buying my car.   I felt like I was family.   The fact that they didn't make me feel pressured was one of the defining decisions for me to buy the car from this dealership.  I hate feeling like I have to make a decision due to dealership deadlines.   I wanted to buy the car from them because they made me feel like they wanted me to have the car for me, not to meet sales goals.  Bill was excellent, Kenny was so nice and really tried to accommodate my needs, the gentleman who did the financing and even the guy who drove my car to me at the dealership were so genuinely nice!   I gave them all hugs!   I will for sure send my friends and coworkers to this dealership.  I have even handed out their business cards already!

I cannot recommend them highly enough. Robert Duarte was a great help throughout my search for a 2012 A6 in Santa Barbara, Ventura and Oxnard. I think the best part was how good he was at responding to my emails, questions that i had about the car. Overall it was my best dealership experience ever (and I've been to a lot in the 18 years I've been driving). This review probably sounds a bit to glowing and happy but at least its true :)",5

428,12-Aug-11,"Kudos to Kenny and his team! This team is amazing!! I found this dealership to be the only one to offer exceptional customer service and go above and beyond what I would expect from a car dealership. While most of the dealers around here seem pushy and almost forceful to make a deal, these guys are not!! Kenny worked very hard to find me a car which I would be completely happy and satisfied with. He made me feel comfortable and did not pressure me into any deal!! I felt that my buying experience was truly in my hands and I my options weren't being taken from me. Kenny actually gave me even more options. I told him what I was looking for and wanted in a car and he found it. While the car wasn't at their lot, the guys actual went and picked it up for me and just a couple days later, it arrived. This team is friendly, knowledgeable and professional. I would most certainly recommend this dealer if you're looking for a nice car minus the headaches of a pushy sales guy who continues to harrass you until you buy something you don't want. I would like to thank all of the guys at DCH AUDI- Oxnard, who assisted me with my purchase, especially Kenny for the wonderful job they did.. WELL DONE FELLAS !!!!

430,01-Aug-11,"This is my second lease/buy with DCH Oxnard. 

I would rate this dealer in a top category for two reasons.  

I live in SF, CA, and called them from home to do the purchase.  They had a car and within two days, the deal was closed.
It took no more than 45 minutes of my time to buy the car at a great price.  The fastest deal ever.

Second, I had to drive 350 miles South to pick up the car.  Jeff and PAtrick facilitated this by meeting me half way in Santa Maria, which was a sacrifice for them, as it was time off the floor, but helped speed the delivery for me.  They will go out of their way to do the job and I really appreciated that.

I explained that I just started looking at different cars on the market and I wanted to test drive the A4. He was very patient and understanding. I looked at other cars that day and what I found most appreciative after my first day of car shopping was that Tom emailed me a week later. I find it to be very annoying when dealers call you multiple times. Tom was gracious to email me first. Not only was I sold on the car, but I felt very comfortable with everyone at the dealership. When I went to go finalize all the paperwork, I met 3 other people at the dealership. And I really apologize that I cannot remember their name. I am very bad at remembering peoples' name. But anyways the process was easier than I imagined and they all made me feel so important. I drove off the lot in my new car and just had the biggest smile on my face and I knew that I owe a lot of that to the people at DCH Audi in Oxnard.",5
440,02-Jul-11,"Robert Duarte made the new car buying experience painless and professional. No high pressure, no annoying calls. He was able to explain all aspects of the 2011 A4 Audi. He let the car speak for it self and it made it's statement loud and clear. An ""A-1"" rating from a new ""A-4"" owner!",5
441,29-Jun-11,The dealer and sales person were very responsive in obtaining the Audi I was looking for. Mitch gave me a great deal and I was very impressed with his honesty during the negotiation. The experience was great and I look forward to working with them again!,5
442,27-Jun-11,"Wonderful! made it easy. Very friendly, made buying my first car a really really great experience! Even after purchasing the car, they made ""ironing out the details"" a really pleasant experience. The Staff here really is THE BEST. THANK YOU MITCH !!! ",5
444,21-Jun-11,Robert has tirelessly handled every aspect of my car buying experience with grace and a smile. This is especially remarkable considering this purchase was a dealer trade from an affiliate. I will definately do business with Robert again.,5
445,20-Jun-11,Great experience.  Very easy and without surprises.  Mitchell worked very hard to find my vehicle for me.  I will certainly recommend this dealership to my friends and come back in the future.,5
446,18-Jun-11,"Went in looking for new A4.  Tom was great - friendly, knowledgeable, not pushy, and very fair..  We got a great price for our trade-in and were very satisfied with the price of the new Audi.  We LOVE the new A4!!  Would highly recommend the car, as well as the salesman!!",5
447,15-Jun-11,"Stopped in, wasn't sure if I could make the numbers work, was upside down on trade. I really wanted this preowned Audi. Dion and Bill went above and beyond to make it happen. After some paperwork issues with trade, everything's fine. I love my audi! Thanks to the hard work of the guys at Audi, they made my new audi possible.",5
448,15-Jun-11,"Robert Duarte is the best car salesman I've dealt with. He was very friendly, personable and knowledgeable about the vehicles he sells. He answered all my questions about the car, and even offered to come to my house to answer additional questions, should they arise. I am very happy with my A4, and I would recommend DCH Audi of Oxnard and Robert Duarte to anyone in the market for a new car.",5
449,15-Jun-11,Went in not looking for a car.  Found the perfect car and they met all my needs.  Couldn't be happier with the trade in they gave me on my old car and absolutely love my new.  I would recommend Gabe in finance to any of my friends and Bill Profeta was a wonderful sales person to deal with.  No pressure at the table.  5 stars all the way.,5
450,15-Jun-11,This was a good car buying experience.  Jeff was very knowledgable and provide a no hassle sales experience.  Additionally he provide me with options to get me in the car I wanted at the price that worked for me.  ,5
451,13-Jun-11,"very helpful with helping us find the car that we wanted.  made the transaction as smooth as possiable.  great guy, very nice and new all about the car that I had leased, was able to answer my questions. ",5
452,06-Jun-11,"This dealership and my sales person  went above and beyond to help everything run smoothly while going thru the process of buying my car. I felt 100% comfortable them which says a lot, especially when buying something so personal as a car!! I would highly refer Krnneth to my family and friends!! ",5
453,05-Jun-11,"Great salesman, great dealership.  excellent service all around.
Bought a used vehicle and was very happy with the quality of it and the pricing.",5
456,29-May-11,"took my car in for service. love that they had a car for me to use during this time, makes life so much easier!!  my work schedule varies and some times i get called in at last min. and the service dept. was so understanding, they never made me feel that i was a bother",5
458,27-May-11,"Coming in to the dealership I had no intention of buying an Audi, although it is a dream car of mine. I came in for a 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee, a vehicle I've wanted since high school. After inquiring online about the SUV my would be sales person, Jon Condran, promptly responded even though it was about 9 pm. I made it down to Oxnard from Santa Barbara, test drove the car and began talking a deal with Jon and Kenny Tompkins. The next day, bright and early they came back with a deal and offered me the Jeep.
My best friend who trusts no one except himself told me to listen to and buy a car from Jon. That right there is saying a lot.
They were out of this world friendly and understanding and did everything they could, despite me less than perfect credit history. I even got a cookie out of the deal! 
Without saying much more, my experience with DCH Audi of Oxnard was an amazing and enlightening one to say the least. I'm thrilled to have ended up buying a car from these guys.  ",5
460,26-May-11,"The Oxnard Audi dealership appears to be well maintained and the staff cordial and very helpful.  Specifically, I worked with salesperson Jon Condran.  He was very helpful.  He didn't make me feel pressured into buying a car and spent a lot of time showing me available cars and discussing purchasing options.",5
462,25-May-11,"Reg was very help full in deciding which car to select since we weren't sure whether we want to buy a new or a used car or an A4 or an A3. There wasn't any pressure. Reg and his Manager Gab worked with us regarding price and explained their cost and what is the best price they could offer. Reg also explained all the features such as bluetooth, navigation, etc in the car we bought and set it up for us. Reg was very patiently answered all of our repeated questions and made us comfortable there and the car buying process easier. I will go again to buy another car.",5
463,23-May-11,"Incredibly helpful, and most importantly, honest. At no point did I have the sense that they were trying to get one over on me, which is a refreshing experience when it comes to dealing with car salesman...will definitely return here for another car, and the car isn't bad either ",5
464,18-May-11,I gave Robert Duarte at DCH Audi all 5s because he made my car buying experience pressure free and he was very informative and accomodating. It was a painless purchase and I was in and out in no time. I love the car and feel I bought it for a decent price.,5
465,16-May-11,"Rea went above and beyond to help my wife and I get the financing we needed to buy the perfect car.  We came in there not knowing anything about our credit and how we were going to buy the car that we wanted and he worked all day to figure out a way for us to purchase the car we wanted.  Before that, he found the exact car that I had asked for right away (which was VERY specific).  I had talked to him on the phone before ever meeting him and he found the car I wanted that day and I had an appointment to come see it for the next day!  Not for a car kind of like the one I wanted, but for the exact car I wanted!  He was very knowledgable and had answers to all of our questions.  Not only that, but he was very nice and we just really liked him.  We wouldn't buy a car from someone who we didn't like!  We will come back to him in the future and tell all our family and friends to work with him when they want an Audi.  ",5
466,28-Apr-11,I had searched for my car over the internet and in-person with no success. Just left a car dealer that wouldn’t even talk to me regarding price after I told them how much I wanted to spend and  pre-qualified for a loan. Going home disappointed with the way I was treat decide to stop by Audi just to look. Mitchell came out and was awesome!!! Told him that I wanted the vehicle across the street and what had happened. Being that they dealers were owned by the same company Michelle went across the street picked up the vehicle and had me driving home in 1 hour. Didn’t over spend and received great customer service.    ,5
467,04-Apr-11,This was my first experience with Audi of Oxnard. Mitch was exceptionally helpful and straightforward and made the usually painful process of buying a new car pleasant and stress-free. He went to great lengths to help me find the right car and was very easy to deal with in negotiating a fair purchase price. The entire process went smoothly and they have made me a loyal customer. I could not be happier with my experience not only with Mitch but the entire team at Audi of Oxnard.,5
468,03-Apr-11,"As soon as I entered the dealership, I was met with a friendly group who really helped me find the exact car I was looking for.  I drove off with the car of my dreams.  This is a great team of salesman.  I look forward to the same service when I have my car serviced.  Thants to everyone for making my day!",5
470,28-Feb-11,"I have been shopping around for a while for a used Q5- these things are hard to come by!  I was looking for a Premium Plus because I figured it had everything I needed.  I then saw a beautiful black on black used Prestige at DCH in the Autotrader.  The price was unlisted, so I figured what the heck I'll check it out.

I got an email back from Jon, and as expected the price was too high.  And this is where Jon and DCH really came through.  I let Jon know that I really wasn't prepared to pay that much for a used Q5, and he promptly responded with a nice price cut.  He was engaging and clearly willing to work with me to find a price we could agree on.

We finally agreed on a price which I was very pleased with- by comparing available Q5 Prestige's in the ENTIRE USA on Autotrader, I got a great deal.  There may have been one somewhere out there, but honestly I doubt it.

I have bought quite a few cars, some new, some not. Anytime I have gone to a dealer I have felt like I would have gotten a better deal if I had gone to a private seller.  Not so with DCH.  I feel like we both did great with the deal and I am a happy buyer.

If you are looking for an Audi, new or used, I would highly recommend giving them the opportunity to show you what they can do for you to get you into the car you want for the price you want. ",5
471,16-Feb-11,"It's not very often that buying a car is a ""pleasurable"" experience, but Robert Duarte and the crew at DCH Audi of Oxnard were awesome!!  Not only did they get me the car that I wanted, but also at a great price. Next time I'm in he market for a new or used vehicle, you can be sure that Robert Duarte at DCH Audi of Oxnard is who I'm calling!",5
472,11-Feb-11,"My partner and I just bought an Audi A5 cabrio which we had special ordered.  Tom made the process quite painless -- really, the waiting was the hardest part!

We had gone to a few Audi dealers for test drives and we were the most comfortable with Tom.  He seemed quite happy to help us, but not in the normal high-pressure way that you expect.  He was simply seemed to truly like the product he was selling, seemed to be in no hurry, and that was his sales approach.  

However, for must of us, price is really the determining factor. So, when we were ready to buy we solicited a number of dealers, with the expectation that we would simply go for the dealer who gave us the most straight-forward answer with the lowest price.  We hoped that would come from DCH Audi, just because we liked them best, but weren't necessarily expecting that.

In fact, Tom responded quickly, matched our price, we made a deal, and that was it.  On pick-up, all the paper work was ready, everything was exactly as agreed, and we probably spent about 15 minutes total doing the paper work. 

I would recommend DCH Audi, and especially Tom, to anyone in the market for one of these cars.  I would say, however, that it appears that there is not a lot of stock out there for particular colors and packages, so if you are looking for something special, you may need to order it. You can, however, ask a dealer you like if they will try to track down a car from another dealer.  That was an option we considered before deciding on our special order. ",5
474,21-Dec-10,Robert and the entire DCH Audi staff were wonderful. They made me feel relaxed and comfortable while making my purchase. They were extremely kind and accomidating. And the Cafe Mocha was wonderful. Robert goes above and beyond what is expected of him and makes you feel as though he is helping a family member. I highly recommend Robert and DCH Audi for new or used vehicles.,5
478,05-Dec-10,"What a fantastic experience.  I live in Santa Barbara, CA and I have experienced multiple disappointments in the level of service provided by Audi of Santa Barbara. So, my wife and I took our business to DCH Audi of Oxnard and we have found our Audi dealer for life.  I am an Audi entusiast, I will likely buy Audi's for the rest of my life and I plan on making those purchases at Audi of Oxnard.  They have a better selection of Audi's than Santa Barbara, a dealership that is dedicated to AUDI, (no BMW sales or service guys looking down on you as I've experienced in Santa Barbara), and Oxnard's Customer Service is Top Notch.  We had two goals in going to Audi of Oxnard, trade in my 2006 A4 and get into a new 2011 A4...the goal was easily accomplished and it was the best car buying experience I've ever had.  The new 2011 A4's are incredible cars...I'm very happy with the improvements Audi has installed and the performance is 2nd to none for the money.  Go see Jeff and get a new Audi, especially if you're in the Santa Barbara area but aren't satisfied by Audi of Santa Barbara.",5
480,16-Nov-10,Exceptional service! No pressure sales and no hassle finance.  It was the best car buying experience I have ever had! My sales rep went above and beyond in so many areas.  He made sure that my used car purchase was safe and up to ALL standards.  Thank you DCH Audi of Oxnard!,5
482,02-Nov-10,"Robert Duarte was our car dealer.  We were blown away by 
the professionalism, efficiency and friendliness we received.
I would definitely refer friends and family to Robert.  My
husband and I are extremely pleased with our Audi and the
excellent customer service skills Robert demonstrated.
Robert really listened to what we wanted.  He was sensitive 
to our needs and worked out a deal we could not refuse!
Thank you Robert! Gabriel was awesome! This is our first 
Audi car and first experience with Audi. We are definitely 
fans! ",5
483,02-Nov-10,We were looking for an used Audi Q5 and were having quite a time finding the deal we could not refuse.  We called DCH Oxnard to make sure the advertised car was still available.  Gabe was accessible by telephone and told us the care was still available and was willing to hold the car until we could get there given the 1 1/2 hour drive to Oxnard.  The drive was well worth the deal we got.  I love my car!,5
485,29-Oct-10,"Tom was the salesman I worked with. I don't like spending a lot of time at car dealerships and he didn't want to waste my time. He listened carefully to what I wanted, encouraged me to test drive a couple of different cars--new and used--so that I could be sure to make an informed decision. No pressure at all, only the information I needed to make my purchase efficiently. Roger delivered my car and gave me a thorough tutorial in all of the controls and systems. This was a very pleasant experience.",5
486,21-Oct-10,"My sales person, Jeff, was helpful from the moment I walked in. He immediately understood what kind of car I was looking for, and we were testing driving a similar car within 15 minutes. Jeff worked hard to find me the exact A5 I wanted within three days, and the delivery service was amazing. Perhaps Jeff is so great because he is ""Women Certified!"" I'll definitely send my friends to him.

Roger, the brand specialist, has also been very helpful getting me used to all of the great new technology in my car. He doesn't seem to mind my many phone calls and questions, and always takes time for me.

I look forward to developing these relationships at Audi over the lease of my car--and hopefully onto the next new car.",5
487,13-Oct-10,"Robert Duarte was fantastic at listening to MY needs, and finding me the right car (truck) to fit my budget!  Gabe Ulloa was instrumental in putting the deal together and getting me the best financing for my situation...  I would definitely recommend DCH Audi, Oxnard, as a great place to buy a car.  And when I can swing it, I plan to go down and buy an A8 or maybe a Q7 from these guys...!! They are the BOMB!! Woohooooo!!",5
488,13-Oct-10,"This was an absolute great experience. Robert's knowledge and professionalism were great. He listened to what I was looking for and directed me to the vehicles that met my interests. His understanding to my unique situation and how my process was to be conducted, accounts to his understanding of ""Customer First"" and the process of taking the time to go over the options. I would definately recommend the DCH Family of Dealers and especially Mr. Robert Duarte to take care of you car needs. 

Thanks Robert....

489,29-Sep-10,"my dealings with Robert were fantastic. not only did i receive great attention from the staff but the showroom is as comfortable as my home. tons of refreshments and goodies, flatscreen with the game on, leather sofas, just fantastic. while surfing 3 days after my purchase, i locked my keys out of my car. so i borrowed a cell phone and called the dealership (since the number was on the registration sticker), Robert  insisted on driving 20 miles north on pch to bring me an extra set of keys. saved the day, thats what i call going above and beyond.

thank you Robert and Audi of Oxnard, your customer for life!

490,29-Sep-10,I went to just look at cars at Audi and ended up buying one beacause of the great customer services Gabe provided. He was very knowledgeable and helpful. Everyone there was great. I will definetly recommend this dealership to my friends and family members. ,5
492,22-Sep-10,"VERY GOOD SERVICE, PEOPLE IN THE DEALER IS SO KIND AND THEY TRY TO HELP IN EVERYTHING.

493,20-Sep-10,"This was the most painless car buying experience I have ever been through.  I am more than impressed with your dealership from the lot to the staff, you have a first class team!  Jonathan was very helpful throughout the entire process and was very well versed with the product.  Keneth was a consumate professional and made the business end of things very smooth and easy to deal with.  I would absolutely recommend any/all of my family and friends to use them in the future.",5
494,15-Sep-10,"The staff were seemingly honest.  The sales staff deferred to another departmental staff member for my test drive when I arrived (because all sales members were occupied), which I appreciated.  The staff is respectful and performed good follow-through.",5
495,14-Sep-10,"Customer service was exceptional, the staff as a whole was helpful and informative. Never felt pressured to buy. Smoothest hassle free experience with a dealer. They went out of their way to get the car we wanted from another dealer, had it the next day.",5
496,12-Sep-10,"We'd never been to this dealership and from past experiences in the purchase of a car it had never been quick and easy. Audi of Oxnard gave us an experience we never even dreamed of. Direct offers and counter offers, quick negotiations, unbelievably so. They were very nice people.  ",5
497,11-Sep-10,I went into this dealer just to look and test drive the Audi Q5. I loved the car and the salesperson Jeff. He was so helpful and explained everything about the car.. We went back and forth on the price and he called me the 24 hours later with the price I wanted. I had already decided I would wait another 6 months but it was a deal I couldn't turn down. I love my new car!,5
498,09-Sep-10,"I purchased a new A5 coupe at a price significantly lower than any of the other dealers in the area.  The salesman, Jon Condran, was extremely helpful and responsive during our negotiations.  I never felt any pressure to complete a deal by any specific time.  I would highly recommend working with Jon.  Thanks!!!! ",5
499,05-Sep-10,"I had a great experience with DCH Audi Oxnard. Outstanding customer service and follow through. Jonathan was extremely responsive and a pleasure to deal with. I would recommend him to all my family and friends.I really like my new A4 and had a wonderful overall experience.
",5
500,25-Aug-10,"Roger and Chase were straight shooters from the start and did not hassle me.  Understood that I was in sales also, and doing lots of comparison shopping at variuos dealers, Audi and other looking to stretch my dollar this time around.  I've always been a loyal BMW or Mercedes Sports Car driver, from previously owning a BMW 540 to a Mercedes E55 AMG.  Performance and Sporty Look is what I cared about.  This is my first Audi and I'm Loving It more than any previous model.. something I thought I would never say! Even took my girlfriend with me for the negotiatins, who is a Pit Bull at negotiating, and they were able to make her happy... god knows that's a challenge.

Extremely happy with the vehicle and the quality of service from these two gentlemen... Only wish the vehicle would have been taken away from Audi Keys in Van Nuys who were extremely rude, unprofessional and had no class as sales executives.  They should send their Sales team, including their Mgmt to Audi of Oxnard for training on customer service!  Sending several family members your way along with my girlfriend who is looking to trade her Mercedes E350 for the A5.

Driving down from Pasadena to Audi of Oxnard made it all worth while.  Thanks for the pleasant experience.

501,02-Jun-10,"I had a great experience at the DCH Audi because Gabe and Eddie were very helpful with informing us about the A4 that I wanted to get. The customer service was great! They were very friendly and helpful. The price was good as well because Gabe offered us a really good deal. Overall, I would recommend this dealership to my friends and family because I love the car I got and the price I got it for. ",5
502,27-May-10,"I went to DCH Audi to test drive and price A6's. I really wanted an A5 but had given up after getting two really high lease quotes from other dealers. The guys at DCH were really honest and easy to work with. After quoting a couple A6's they gave me a quote for the A5 I wanted and it was about $150 less a month then the other dealers. They gave me a great deal!

By far the best dealership experience I've ever had!",5
503,27-Apr-10,Chase and Roger were fantastic to work with.  Chase is the Internet Sales / Fleet Manager and Roger is a Sales Associate.  They were both extremely friendly and very helpful.  They took the time to answer our questions and made us a great deal on the car we were looking for.  I would definitely recommend these two to anyone looking to buy a new or used car from this dealer.,5
504,24-Apr-10,"Chase Dunning was able to get my dream car.  I went to the dealership to get a used car and Chase took the time to speak with me about what I was looking for.  He was kind, courteous, and professional.  He was so good at what he does, that instead of getting a used car with no warranty, I was able to drive out of the dealership in a BRAND NEW 2010 Audi A5 Cabriolet.  Chase made the options affordable, realistic, and smart.  After explaining the overall cost of the car over 3, 5, and 7 years, it was a no brainer.  I cannot believe that if I had not met chase that I would be driving a used car with no warranty.  Chase's knowledge of the cars, finances, and everything else is unfathomable.  I cannot imagine buying another car without speaking to him first.  

On top of everything, he didn't have the exact car that I wanted, so he went out of his way at peak hour on the weekend to get me my perfect car.  This dealership is the top of the line and should serve as the example for all others.  I am so grateful for all of Chase's help and will recommend him to everyone that I know!",5
505,17-Apr-10,"I went to a number of local dealerships and could not stand the people and the service.  It was unbelievable that a luxury brand like Audi could have such rude people.  I eventually made my way to DCH Audi and talked to Chase Dunning.  He was exactly what I expected from a luxury brand.  He was friendly, helpful, and did not make the experience unbearable.  In fact, it was the best experience I have ever had buying a car.  All of the other dealerships made me walk around a hot, dirty parking lot to look at cars.  Chase did not.  He asked me what I was looking for and found it.  Then, he brought the car up so that I could stay comfortable!  I was shocked at how professional and courteous he was.  I will never purchase any car without calling Chase first.  I highly recommend DCH, specifically Chase.  ",5
506,06-Apr-10,"I was looking around for a 2010 Audi A5 and called about 5 dealerships before I called DCH.  When I got through to DCH I spoke with Chase Dunning and in about 10min he gave me a quote over the phone that was WAY below what the other dealerships were asking.  Then I had to make sure they had the car...and they did (the other dealerships said they could ""get"" the car).

When I drove up there to pick the car up, it was detailed and ready to go.  The paperwork was even ready for me and as Chase said, it would only take about 30minutes to process.  Sure enough it took about 40min, but I must say...they are the best dealership to deal with.  I have even emailed Chase a few times with some questions and he got me the answer(s) the same day.  I think I am going to be an Audi owner for life or at least I am going to be dealing with DCH Audi from here on out!

No problems with the car and it is running like a dream!

Everyone has to give Chase a call, you will get the best price...!",5
507,25-Mar-10,"I was looking for a New Audi A4 for my girlfriend. I had called in all the dealers across the LA county, and most of them couldn’t give me a reasonable quote for us. As soon as I called to DCH Audi of Oxnard sales rep, the quote he gave in 5 minutes, and he beat all the dealers I have called. I previously had 4 purchase/lease experience in the past, and I have to comment that I never had such a great communication, personal approach, customer relationship and business experience from all perspective. All I want to say is that we had a car delivered to us next day and we are so happy with it. and I am recommending to everyone who is on the market looking for Audi. DCH Audi is your only place to go. Don’t bother even calling or going to any of them. Just call DCH and they will take care of you. I personally have to say that Dealership had proven that they guarantee that we got the car we wanted at the best competitive price and monthly payments. Good luck.

508,25-Mar-10,"I wanted to share my overwhelmingly positive and professional experience with a recent 2010 Audi A6 purchase through your organization. As a business executive with over 20 years experience in sales, marketing and technology I can honestly state I have not had a better car shopping, financing and purchasing experience than I did with the team of: Ron Garcia, Chase Dunning and Jon Condran.
Please keep in mind that I am not the easiest of customers – having been a car broker in the late 1980’s and having purchased over 8 new vehicles in the past 14 years. , I’ve been shopping for cars for the last 11 months seeking both a dealership as a relationship (one where the customer is treated with genuine respect and consideration) and someplace I truly would want to do business for this purchase and other purchases in the years to come.  I’m also technically savvy and highly knowledgeable about cars.  I tend to ask the tough questions, expect immediate feedback and I’m expecting desired results… sometimes without having to ask. In addition, I was really looking for a dealership and professionals that I can recommend to friends and my employees without a moment’s hesitation.
Over the past decade, the positive facets of the auto buying experience have nearly disappeared for consumers and many of the negative things you hear about new car dealers are unfortunately true… (just go across the street if you don’t believe me)...
Throughout California as well as other states I have traveled to in the past year, the exceptional service I received from the team of Ron, Chase and Jon at DCH Audi of Oxnard is by far the best and they are simply outstanding for their Knowledge, Honesty, Professional Approach, Patience, Follow Up, Communications Skills and Solutions.  On the shopping side, from the moment I first walked in the door to my second and third visits wherein all my questions were answered in detail and it became clear that your store truly has its “ducks in a row” and your team understands both the psychology of the sale and the detailed management of the process to make customers happy.
I’m Thrilled with my new purchase and I’m overwhelmingly  impressed with the buying experience, attention to detail, delivery professionalism and fluid manner you have created doing business with your customers at DCH Audi Oxnard. Please feel free to use me as a recommendation or reference anytime and be assured that I shall be sending more customers your way. Thank you and keep up the great work!

Over the past decade, the positive facets of the auto buying experience have nearly disappeared for consumers and many of the negative things you hear about new car dealers are unfortunately true… (just go across the street if you don’t believe me)...
Throughout California as well as other states I have traveled to in the past year, the exceptional service I received from the team of Ron, Chase and Jon at DCH Audi of Oxnard is by far the best and they are simply outstanding for their Knowledge, Honesty, Professional Approach, Patience, Follow Up, Communications Skills and Solutions.  On the shopping side, from the moment I first walked in the door to my second and third visits wherein all my questions were answered in detail and it became clear that your store truly has its “ducks in a row” and your team understands both the psychology of the sale and the detailed management of the process to make customers happy.
I’m Thrilled with my new purchase and I’m overwhelmingly  impressed with the buying experience, attention to detail, delivery professionalism and fluid manner you have created doing business with your customers at DCH Audi Oxnard. Please feel free to use me as a recommendation or reference anytime and be assured that I shall be sending more customers your way. Thank you and keep up the great work!
Sincerely,

Brian D. Skelton

510,25-Mar-10,"I was at the end of my current lease and deciding whether to keep current car or lease a new one.  I had been working with another dealership so I knew the vehicle and price that I wanted.  When I informed the other dealer that I was leaning toward keeping the older vehicle I never heard back from him.  With about two weeks left in the lease I decided to visit DCH Audi Oxnard.  Met Bill Profeta and Ron Garcia. They not only met the price I was looking for but beat it by a few bucks.  They were great to work with, friendly and professional.",5

After ordering a part for my son's A4, after a few days I had to call back to inquire if part had arrived. Judy told me that part had been received the day after I had ordered it. She was disappointed that parts rep had not followed up by calling me.
I told her I would be over that PM to pick it up. When I arrived she again stated that she was sorry that I had not been notified sooner & informed me that the part was mine at no charge because of the inconvenience.

This was not a normal result of a dealer error. I have been inconvenienced many times by dealer parts people, sometimes to the point of rudeness. Never have I received a discount or an apology: just pay the cashier...over there.

Judy has just earned DCH Audi of Oxnard a loyal customer, thanks again.",5

513,12-Mar-10,"My experience, from the beginning 'till the end was the easiest i have ever experience.
The greeting, the test drive, signing the papers, and the delivery of the car was awesome.

I will and have recommended the dealer ship to all my friends. Even though I live about and hour and a half away, it was worth every mile that I had to drive to get there.

Thank You

514,12-Mar-10,"unbelievable service and follow through!!  I went in to review my old lease on my car and came out with the car of my dreams.  The overall transaction was very fluid from beginning to end.  The negotiations were handled professionally and I received great value for my investment.  The sales person was courteous and walked me through everything to make sure I was comfortable.  I have to say, it did not have a rushed feel to it at all.  Most impressive was the amazing lack of paperwork that I had to see or go through.  Their computer system was used to do everything.  Joseph Malek, their head person, went out of his way to make me comfortable and feel at ease.  I would most definitely recommend DCH AUDI for your next car purchase.  The facilities, people, and technology are most deserving of the drive to Oxnard.",5
