1,"May 18, 2020","I have already sent in one survey but here is another one.

As I noted in my last survey, John Holzermer, Service and Parts Director and Steve Edwards, Service Consultant are great employees. They immediately responded to my concerns and I would recommend Riverside Chevrolet to anyone considering purchasing or having their car repaired.

Please let John and Steve know how much I appreciate their efforts.

It took almost as long to deliver the paperwork than performing  the oil change. I asked twice to see why I was waiting  so long for the paperwork. The women arrived and said the service writer said I did not sign the paperwork. This is incorrect that was the first thing I did on the back of the yellow sheet when he check in my vehicle. Some dealership pride  themselves on their servjce. Not sure what happened here.,3.0

26,"March 08, 2020","Faisal was my service advisor.  He was very helpful and explained fully my service issues.  I appreciated getting a diagnostic print out of my car, so I will know what future services I will need.  One thing I notice is that there is not a lot of personnel turnover in the service dept, that gives me confidence in your product. Also Faisal said there is one serviceman who specializes in Saturn, and that is very comforting.  Since Saturn closed down some years back getting a tech who knows the Saturn has been a challenge.  I have been a long time customer, since moving to Riverside in 2014, and as long as you provide excellent customer service I will be a repeat customer.  One thing of concern, please, please call a halt to your rising service prices, or at least offer discount coupons.

33,"February 22, 2020","Steve provide excellent information and service.   Steve and all staff friendly and informative.

Where GMAC has missed the boat for a very sellable auto is that it has not but a Bolt Battery in a Volt.

A car with battery range of Bolt and its energy recovery method and the reserve generator of a Volt would be a great car.  One could driver large distances without the need to stop for hours to recharge a battery, but still for most individual's around home and work would run mostly on the battery.   ",4.0

38,"February 14, 2020",This is the worst dealership (service depart) I’ve ever been to. I got a loaner car dirty with hairs all over. The worst part is leaving them my car back in October/November 2019 bringing it in twice. No communication. I was like a creditor calling them to find out the status and now I come to find out my gasket is still broken.  They never fixed it! thankful that Mark Christopher is taking care if their mistakes. I tried to complaint with Pearl about the service advisor James and left a message for their service manager. Guess what? He never called me just approved a loaner. I didnt bother going back to take them my car. I just contacted GM directly to file a complaint against them ,1.0

116,"September 03, 2019","I really dislike buying a car. It has never been a good experience. There is always stress, anxiety, and a bit of disillusionment. Riverside Chevrolet minimized the anxiety & stress to the point that I was happy when they made me a great deal. In this case all became a win-win. 

Alfredo, Steve and Derek were professional, sympathetic, very positive, friendly, and outgoing. I believe they were not only there to do their job, but to also make me feel good about the deal they offered me. I did not feel intimidated or disrespected. I felt they went beyond to make it happen. I left the dealership very happy at the contract I had just signed. 

Within the next few months my son will need a Commercial Work Truck and I have told him to see what you can for him first. I will recommend your dealership because of the Team that you have hired to serve the customer. I thank you.

cordially,

146,"July 16, 2019","Hard to find service like these guys give. Now a days anywhere you go it just feels like no one cares about your problem or wants to take time out to address concerns, questions, etc...
I was only in for an oil change but I would not hesitate to take my vehicle in for any and all maintenance.
While waiting to be checked in I noticed that all the service writers really cared about assisting everyone in a prompt manner and went out of there way to address concerns. One female service writer saw a customer waiting and since she was close to being finished with the customer she was with, she was able to help him.  I was impressed by this because most of the time service writers take their sweet time and even when they are done assisting customers they still have you waiting while they type stuff on their computer. I was able to over hear the guys complaint about a problem on his truck that had already been looked at but not fixed by another dealership. 
To make a long story short this service writer was able to get a technician to go on a ride along with the customer within apx 10-15 minutes of him addressing his complaint.
Now to me that is service!!! and that's someone who cares!!!
 Denny helped me out with my scheduled oil change, answered all my questions, walked me thru setting up auto diagnostics on my vehicle and by the time I went and grabbed something to eat and came back my truck was done. He made it a quick, easy, no hassle experience.

263,"January 09, 2019","I used to only go to Tom Bell in Redlands because that’s where I bought my truck.  

But every time I went there to get an oil change, they always said my truck was out of alignment (which I had to pay out of pocket) and it ALWAYS was at least a 2-3 hour wait.  They always would nickel and dime me on parts that weren’t covered in the extended bumper to bumper warranty I paid for...So, I took my loses and started going to another place for my oil changes.  
When I bought my new tires at Firestone they check and miraculously my truck was still aligned! Found out by them that it’s a sales tactic they use.  So Tom Bell never again!!

Now the positive side:

I had to get my truck looked at due to a recall so I went to Riverside Chevrolet and met Steve at the service dept.. What a great guy!! He was polite and told me it would take about an hour or so. I left to get something to eat and he called in 35 minutes to say it was done!! He also gave me a car wash voucher so I could get my truck washed!!!  All the people I dealt with at Riverside Chevrolet was awesome and Steve was fantastic!!!

I wished I had bought my truck from Riverside Chevrolet!!!

I would highly recommend seeing him, or visiting Riverside Chevrolet if your comparing prices and in the market for a new vehicle. 
The finance person we worked with had some errors in our finance agreement relating to options we were paying for, which greatly hiked up the price, though fortunately we caught them before signing and had him correct them.  Then the ""Due Bill"" that was written up by the finance rep wrote up was inaccurate, causing me to return to the dealership the next day to have it corrected. The finance rep ""Valarie"" I saw the next day was very helpful and correct the errors for me.
The Servce Team was great as well.  All additional options were installed and performed on-time.

He did stop by my car before I had been there very long and apologize for the wait I was about to experience and he was hustling so I know he got to me as soon as he could. I feel that they need to have a better way to monitor the appointments that are made online by the customers so they are not so over booked. When I was finally checked in I was told I had about a 2 hour wait and when I told the girl I had been told on the phone when I made the appointment that it would take about an hour she apologized and said that because I was waiting I would be given priority and I think I was because about 45 minutes later she came and said my car was done.

384,"August 07, 2018","I have mostly been very happy with my service experience at Riverside Chevy. The service advisors are knowledgeable and helpful, and the actual work on my car is great. But I have 2 main problems. The first is that whenever I call with a question and no one in service is available to take my call (which is most of the time, and I understand that's how it is in a busy shop), no matter how many times I call (my record is 4 times in a single day), no one EVER returns the call. Ever. That is unacceptable to me. The second thing is that the folks in charge of the loaners have told me twice that I was ineligible for a loaner because my car wouldn't be in long enough. But each time, it turned out my car was in for most of the day. The service advisor offered me a car at that point, but by then I had a ride and didn't have time to wait longer for the loaner. Again, pretty poor customer service. Also, on a side note, why did you stop providing free car washes? You say to conserve water...but of course I'm still going to wash my car...it's just not you that has to do it now.",4.4

Even when I had to bring my car back to have it re-fixed, I'm not even sure it was anyone's fault that it wasn't fixed in the first place. And they gave me a courtesy car that was way nicer than my car. So in all those respects, they are excellent. But here's the thing that doesn't sit well with me. When they fixed my car the first time, it ended up leaking big time all over my parking space after I took it home. If I had a nice driveway or garage, I would be pissed. One of those guys would be out at my place every day until that spot was clean. I'm not joking. I'm not sure what could've been done to catch that leak, and maybe there was nothing that could've been done. And I'm fortunate that I don't have a driveway or a garage. But it could've turned out disastrous. So when you ask if I'd recommend the dealership, I'd do so with a caveat.

I prefer to wait at home, so after I got there, I asked service advisor James Wood for a shuttle ride and was immediately given one (driver Manny?).  Shortly thereafter I was advised that I could really use 4 new tires, as I suspected.  They finished putting on the new tires and changing the oil and sent the shuttle (driver Bob) to pick me up and I got my car back the same day.  The new tires are Ironman tires of the same size and type as the mixture of Firestone and Bridgestone that were on it, but the new Ironman have A ratings for both tread and heat.  Everybody was friendly and I enjoyed the conversation with the shuttle drivers.

448,"April 20, 2018","What are the ups and downs of buying a car?  First finding what you want, then making a deal that works for both parties.  Finding a dealer, you like working with and that isn’t pushy about making a sale but works with you to get your long-term business not just one-time sale.  The best deal is the one where you get the car and price you want and the dealer gets the sale he needs.  
Over the years I have purchased a lot of cars and most have been a painful process.  Something always seemed to go wrong or you felt like you were cheated in some way and accepted it as doing business.  That wasn’t the experience I had at Riverside Chevrolet when I purchased my new 2018 Traverse.  It truly was one of the best car buying experiences I have had.
Currently with the internet it allows you to look at all the dealers in your area and see their inventory and find the car you think you want before going to the deal and making a deal.  I did just that and at first just went and looked and talked to a few to the sales people.  They didn’t have what I wanted but assured me that they could get it.  The dealers always have new cars coming from the factory, but don’t always know what is coming.  The there’s the salesman that you pick and I did.  I had talked to one of the salesman at Riverside Chevrolet a number of times, his name Joe Gotti.  We hit it off right at the start and though it took a few months before deciding I would buy a new car.  I knew that he would be my salesman.  I hope you get the idea, they want to work with you.
Let me cut to the chase and say he went out of his way trying to find the car I wanted.  I also checked out a number of other Chevrolet dealers, but it wasn’t the same.  Anyway, Joe Gotti found the car I ended up buying at another dealership in Southern CAL and brought it to Riverside not knowing for sure if I would buy it.  We did the normal back and forth on the final price but came to an agreement that I was very happy with as where they.  I would recommend Riverside Chevrolet to anyone interested in buying one of their products.  They really do go out of their way to make all parties happy.

536,"January 15, 2018","On Dec 15 and 16th of 2017 My wife and I drove our 2017 Silverado 3500 from our home in Oklahoma to Riverside, Ca. Just hours prior to us leaving on this trip, we were notified of a recall by the salesman whom we had bought the vehicle from. The issue with the recall affected the fuel gauge operating correctly. We had not experienced any of the symptoms related to the recall. But that changed just hours into our trip. We arrived at our destination on the evening of Dec. 16th, which was a Saturday. Knowing that there weren't any dealerships open at that hour, I chose to wait until Monday morning to contact a dealership near our location to see about having the issue resolved. 
At approx. 8:00 a.m. on Monday Dec. 18th I utilized Onstar to find a dealership near our location. Pearl, at Onstar connected me with Antonio, who works in the service dept. at Riverside Chevrolet. I explained our situation to Antonio and advised him of the recall that we had been made aware of. Antonia stated that if I could be at Riverside Chevrolet by 9:00 a.m. he could get us in by noon. I arrived at Riverside Chevrolet at approx. 8:40 a.m. Upon my arrival I spoke with Antonio and again advised him of the recall that I had been made aware of. Antonio stated that if the issue that I was having with the vehicle was related to the recall, the dealership should have the parts required to repair it. Because Chevrolet normally sends extra parts to the dealerships to repair vehicles that are affected by recalls. I inquired about a ""loaner"" vehicle since mine was in for service do to a recall. Antonio stated that I could get a ""loaner"" and that he would get one for me. I was then directed to another area of the dealership to fill out the required paperwork for the ""loaner"". While filling out the required papers for the ""loaner"", I was asked for a credit card. I asked why my credit card was needed if the ""loaner"" was complimentary. I was told that my credit card would not be charged, but that it was just put on file for incidentals, or in case in didn't refill the vehicle with fuel. I again asked why my credit card was needed, ""if it won't be charged""? I was then told that it wouldn't be charged with out my prior authorization. I advised that I wasn't comfortable giving my credit card information for no reason, if they are so certain that it will not be charged. I was then advised that I would not be able to get a ""loaner"" vehicle without giving my credit card information. And that I should really get the ""loaner"" vehicle because the dealership may not have the parts required to repair mine today. I then questioned why they wouldn't have the parts if it is recall related and if Chevrolet sent out extra parts to repair issues related to recalls; and that they are suppose to be able to get my vehicle in by noon since I had arrived prior to 9:00 a.m. At that point Antonia stated that they would do the best that they could and directed me to the customer's waiting area. 
The repairs were made by noon and I have not had any further issues to date. 
But I feel like I was simply be told what was required to get me into the dealership, and then to get me into a ""loaner"" so that the dealership could charge the manufacturer for the ""loaner"". I feel like the dealership was more concerned about getting me in there, and then figuring out how to capitalize monetarily however they could. And that the repairs would not have been made in a timely manner had I not periodically checked with Antonio and reminded him of the timeline that he had stated. 
I do not feel that the priority of Riverside Chevrolet is to be honest and forthcoming with the customers; as is getting the customer in, then capitalize on them being there. ",2.0

I was apprehensive to even try a GM product after I lost almost $100k (Retirement Fund/Stock Certificates) in the  bankruptcy/reorganization. My sister wanted a small SUV from the local Chevy dealership, against my better judgement, I agreed. 
It took three salesmen to try and beat us down but when that didn't work, they left us waiting for over two hours to make a cash transaction with finance. Even after we got into the finance department, a man who called himself ""The Director of Finance"" came into the office and interrupted us several times. When I told him to please leave the finance guy alone to complete our transaction, he got bent out of shape and lectured me on being respectful when spoken too.

I was using a rental car (provided by them) and was forced to bring it back (so it could be sold for the Labor day weekend.  While switching the rental, they tried to put me in an F-150 that was listed at $26,000.  I needed to be around $22,000 for the trade-in and payments would work.  They said maybe they could squeeze it down to $24,000 at the best.  Went home and found the same truck listed on the internet at $22,000.  I hate the BS games.  I was loyal to them and felt pretty screwed.  When I picked up my Captiva it looked like someone had eaten glazed donuts while driving it and was dirty as xxxx.  Needless to say....

When I walked into the service office there were 4 service writers in the office 1 helping someone and 3 pecking away at their keyboards, all 4 SR completely ignored me for about 10 while I stood there.  When I was waiting the 10 minute I over heard 1 of the SR calling on the radio for a Porter to bring up a vehicle he stated to who ever answered that the a lady had been waiting almost 30 minute for the to bring up her car...  Once a SR finaly acknowledged me I told him I was there for an oil change and break inspection and that I was leaving the car.  He said ""ok, but it wont be ready until tomorrow afternoon"" I said ""really?""  He replied ""Yes, we have like 45 appointment"" I then remembered and told him that I had scheduled an appointment for the next morning for 7:30 and told. He replied ""then it will be ready in the morning"".

The next day I went to the dealership to pick up my truck I like the lady the previous day waited over 20 minutes for my truck to be brought up, I assumed it was being washed so I didn't mind.  Turned out that was NOT the case, while I waited I witnessed a gentleman come in to the waiting area and conplain to the cashier of a similar situation she directed him to a manager at the front of the store just as a porter walked in the door he asked what the issue was in Spanish she told the porter the issue and he said to the casher the customer should ""go sxxxw himself"".  In Spanish.

679,"June 30, 2017","When I discovered that the airbag light needed to be resolved on my 2006 Saturn Vue (no service centers available) I asked the Jeep-Chrysler of Ontario service manager if they could check it so that it could be fixed.  He suggested Riverside Chevrolet since they were under the family of Jeep-Chrysler of Ontario.  I took my Vue in and was told they have a Saturn specialist on board and he would be the person to check everything out for me.  That afternoon I received a phone call indicating what the problem was, a part was needed to be ordered, and the car should be done the next day.  True to their word a phone call was returned the next mid-day and all seems to have been resolved.  So far, I am quite pleased.",4.8

They wanted me to fill out all of the paperwork, so i would only have to sign if i liked it.   I wrote them a $1000 check to show i was serious, and said call me when the car i want is here.  
I did not hear from them until late the next day, when the General Manager said they could only find a car 300 miles away, and well confirmed that he did not want to bring it in.   I asked for my check back, they mailed it back as promised.   BUT SINCE THEN THESE xxxxxxxx HAVE SENT ME TWO LETTERS SAYING THEY DENIED ME CREDIT, AND APPLIED THE DENIAL TO MY EXPERIAN REPORT !!!!   I NEVER SIGNED THE CREDIT REQUEST.    SO MY 750 + SCORE WAS NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR THEM.
I WOULD NEVER EVER DO BUSINESS WITH THIS CORRUPT AND ANGRY GROUP !  THE WORST EVER.        I ended up getting a new Lincoln MKZ Hybred up the street at the Greatest Dealership.
