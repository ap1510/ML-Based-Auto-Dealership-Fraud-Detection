I shared with my service advisor that I am not mechanically inclined and would be depending upon him to help me keep the car in top shape.  I love it and want to keep it for years to come.

381,"July 11, 2018","My car is less than 2 years old and went to the service center to have battery replaced under warranty. the test showed the battery was still good and just needed recharging. I reluctantly accepted this diagnosis. When 4 days later it would not start my car again Had AAA jump start it and made my 2nd trip to the service center, this time to be told it was my starter that was defective, but to leave it overnight to verify. I took a loan car home and the next day I made my 3rd visit to the service center  this time to be told it was my battery that failed and would be replaced under warranty. So after 3 trips and who knows how many hours of my time I received a battery, which gives me serious pause should I have a serious issue. Through it all my service advisor, Bruce, could not have been more helpful, even to calling me with follow up checks. I realize it was not his fault, as he was following the dictates of the policy of either the service manager or the agency or Lexus. So on the basis of.my experience I would have to say it did not exactly inspire confidence—given that I have spent almost $100,000 2 cars over the last 5 years. As I mentioned, the one saving grace was my advisor, Bruce, who couldn’t have been more helpful.",3.8

I had made an appointment (by email) to have my oil change and tires rotated, however on my arrival I was told that I missed the 30,000 mile check which I  overlooked. The issue was with the service tech proceeding to tell me that he didn't think he could have the 30,000 mile service done in time given that my appointment was for 1600.  No problem there;  just give me the oil change, rotate tires, and replace the cabin filter--I could come another day to have the full required service.  The tech did not express this alternative solution, but rather made me feel as though I was stuck on a hold/lost situation that I clearly did not received as sound customer service; I even made the comment that I could take my car elsewhere.

Keys and the instructions were placed into the overnight drop box since it was not normal business hours.   I called about noon on Monday, June 11 to check on the status.  I was told by Angel that the battery was replaced and that they had performed the 90,000 mile service.  I told him that I had specified the 35,000 mile service and that the car barely had 35,000 miles on it. His reply was that the 90,000 service was the same as the 35,000. Is it?  When I went to pick up the car, I checked the paper work and it stated that the service had been performed on a 2007 ES 350 that I no longer own!  I insisted that the paper work be corrected so that Motor City's information would be accurate the next time I bring the RX350 in for service. It was like he was doing me a favor to correct the records.  One would expect more attention to detail given what one has to pay for these cars. This was a sloppy job and not normal at Motor City.

I called from Highway 5 en route from the Bay Area to Los Angeles regarding a problem with the engine warning light on my 450H. From the moment I got Tony on the phone I knew that I was in good hands.
He was extremely helpful on the phone and in person. He really went above and beyond making time late in the day to run a diagnostic on my car so that I could determine whether it was safe to continue on my journey.
Both my husband and I own Lexus vehicles and when we purchase our next we will without hesitation come up from LA to patronize your dealership.
Tony is a true gem.

466,"June 07, 2018","Received a years worth of maintenance when I purchased my vehicle from their used lot in Jan. 2018. Had an appointment set for 715 and had to wait until about 735 until a service writer was available. Normally no big deal but mildy frustrating that day because I informed the representative who scheduled my appointment that I needed to be in and out as I had a meeting at work that I needed to be at no later than 8 am. When I finally got to a service writer Juanita did a tremendous job and was very polite, professional , and knowledgeable  which made my overall experience very enjoyable. only other minute issue was the amount of time it took for the work to be performed. They appear to be a high volume service department so I anticipated it taking a little longer but after dropping my vehicle off it took a good 5 hrs to get a routine service completed. Tremendous customer service and all around  great experience my only recommendation would be for them to try and address the amount of time it takes to have basic jobs completed and be a little more punctual with scheduled appointments.

Note of appreciation:
Lexus Team- excellence 

👍🏽Jayden Brar:

IT tutorials- very knowledgeable and informative-done at home with only an hour notice and spent about 3 HRs. All questions answered!! Many mysteries of technology revealed. 

👍🏽Faraz Ahmed:

Thought he forgot about the Lexus LS 500 that I requested in February 2018
until he called surprisingly to pick it up! On 05/28/2018. Exactly with features that I wanted.He is brilliant and very thorough in meeting customer needs. Love his attention to details. 

👍🏽Ali Douglas:

Made my transition from Lexus ES 350 -2017 to Lexus LS 500 -2018 effortless and transparent. Went way out of usual customer relations and got the transaction concluded as a close friend. He is pleasant to work with no hassles. 

Keep up good work!
A Team!

468,"June 07, 2018",I always look forward to Lexus visits. Staff re always helpful and friendly. The waiting area is usually stocked with a little snack to keep you going while waiting for your vehicle. Today the coffee maker was out of service along with the hot water for the oatmeal. That made me a little sad 😞. But the loaner rx350l was superb and clean. Thanks for everything you do at Lexus. ,5.0

591,"April 23, 2018","I have always been happy and satisfied with the Lexus Service and the quality of repairs and maintenance.  However, on my most recent visit to address the engine light on my instrument panel I was informed that it was a transmission problem/leak and that I should return it to Aamco, that had replaced the transmission only months earlier and that I should not drive it there although I had driven it to Lexus with no problem.  After having it towed the few miles to Aamco, I was informed that while replacing a broken fitting, which caused the leak, they noticed that my rear suspension air bags were broken and that the solenoids were stuck as a result of the system not being disconnected prior to being raised by the Lexus technician when checking underneath the car, which resulted in an extremely bumpy ride back to Lexus after my phone call explaining the problem and complaining about the condition of the suspension.  I was told at that time that the service rep had no knowledge that there was a need to disconnect the system before raising the vehicle.  Later that day, I was told by the same service adviser that the technician assured him that it had been disconnected prior to being raised despite the fact that he had told me previously he did not know of any such requirement.  When I complained that I did not feel that I should have to pay to repair something that was apparently caused by their own conduct.  I was told it may have been the tow company or Aamco that caused the damage and that I would need to pay, and did pay, another $1100.00 to replace the rear system at the insistence of the service manager.  It should be noted that at all times the service Adviser named John was very courteous, helpful and cooperative, but I believe that the decision of the service manager was unfair under the circumstances and that I should not have had to pay for those repairs.",2.0

645,"March 16, 2014","I was at another dealership in Hollywood being messed around with on my price. A friend had just purchased a truck through Bakersfield Lexus and told me to give Rocky a call. When I contacted Rocky he told me to simply walk out, that they were playing a game, and to come back into town and he'd get me in my truck. He brought out a low mileage 2013 Ford that matched exactly what I was looking for and handed me the keys. No trying to sell and push me to buy. When I came back we started the paperwork. I didn't have to haggle because the price was already great, and a few thousand was knocked off for me already. I'm a first time buyer and Jashan, Rocky, and the sales manager (I forget his name unfortunately) worked endlessly to find me the best financing possible. No BS no hassle of having to try to get my price dropped, nothing. I plan on upgrading my wifes car through them in the near future and would recommend them to anyone. ",5.0

All of the other sales force we're very friendly and enthusiastically helped us. Overall it was a wonderful experience and we'll be telling friends and family to head over to Motor City Lexus,",4.8

648,"January 18, 2014","I had to have the font bumper replaced on my 2008 ES 350. Connie did an excellent job of keeping me informed on the progress of the repair. It took the body shop a little longer than they anticipated, but that was because they wanted to make absolutely sure they had the correct red paint match. I had a loaner and had no worries they would make my car look like new and they did. Connie is always professional and a pleasure to work with. Due to the delay on the repair she gave me a great price on the work performed. The Motor City Lexus service department and the entire dealership team are the reason I will always come back to purchase and  for service.

Changed the oil for the 10K mile service. Washed my car and filled the tank with gas.  All on the house at no cost to me.  This is my second Lexus from Motor City.  I don't purchase out of town.  I want my tax dollars to stay in Kern County. When my 6 yr old Lexus was totaled by a red light runner, they went out of their way to help. Even payed for a 24 hour rental car so I could get to work the next day. I Love Motor City.  Will buy my next car from them too.",5.0

652,"November 20, 2013","I found the Lexus dealership in Bakersfield to be very professional, friendly and relaxed.  I was not approached by a salesperson in an aggressive manner like I have experienced in other car sale situations.  It was definitely a very easy-going manner in which the receptionist first approached me and asked if I would like to speak with someone regarding any of the cars.  I first spoke with Heidi who let me discover all the wonderful aspects of the Lexus GX and LX and answered any questions I had.  When I came on a second day I spoke with Marsella, who was very knowledgeable, honest , and very friendly.  On the third day I visited the dealership, I spoke with Sergio, who was equally as wonderful as the other two sales people that I had met with previously.  I appreciated the fact that if he did not know the answer to a question, he admitted that and found the answer immediately.  He was very professional and kind.   I must mention also that Jashan  also was wonderful and very informative as he helped  me to review and sign the sale contract.  He is a great asset to the team there at Lexus because he has a very kind, assuring, and honest manner about him.

When I met with my service advisor,  she took additional time to show me some features on my car in which I was not familiar. Her advice was very helpful. I received a gorgeous brand new courtesy vehicle to use while my car was in service. By the time I returned home, I had received a phone call with completed diagnostics & a plan that I was happy receiving. I feel Motor City Lexus is very fair.  They even washed my car & filled the tank before I picked up my car! This service department goes above & beyond to make their customers comfortable and feeling lucky to own a Lexus. ",4.8

We currently have a BMW and wanted to compare the Lexus SUV for overall ride, comfort and overall dealership friendlyness and customer interaction. We met the salesman Jason, and he was exceptional from the beginning. Jason was was willing to go the extra mile for the customer and showed us he was really trying to make the purchase experience a positive experience. We did purchase a 2014 RX 350 and are very happy with the vehicle. I hope my experience with the service department will be positive as well. Overall, a great experience at the dealership. ",5.0
655,"October 19, 2013","I have been to Motor City Lexus several times in the past for servicing of my 2006 Lexus IS 350.  When looking to purchase my new 2014 Lexus IS 350 F-Sport, I contacted several deals via the internet, including the dealer I purchased my Lexus from.  Motor City Lexus was the only dealer that responded appropriately.  I asked for their Out the Door (OTD) price and received an extremely fair price on exactly the model I was interested in.  In fact, their price was literally thousands of dollars lower than the price originally quoted by the dealer I bought my previous vehicle from (says something about the previous dealers commitment to their customers).  Motor City Lexus definitely went above and beyond to earn my business.  Marcella, the internet sales representative contacted me daily while we worked the deal and discussed pricing and trade in values.  She was open and honest and worked behind the scenes to ensure I got the best price on the new vehicle and a fair trade in value, consistent with Kelly Blue Book pricing for my trade in.  While Marcella was unavailable the day we came in to actually purchase the vehicle, Andie stepped in and handled the paperwork at the dealership.  She moved things along as quickly as possible and paired our cell phones and garage door opener with the vehicle before we left the dealership.  We were in and out in about 2 hours.  When I left some CDs in the trade-in vehicle, I notified them and they were sent to me the next day.  I have always enjoyed the service department at this dealership and now I can confirm that the sales staff is equally outstanding.  I hope to have a continuing relationship with Motor City Lexus and have recommended them to others looking to enjoy the Lexus lifestyle.",5.0
656,"October 05, 2013","     I came in to have my car serviced also because my check engine light was on. Got a 5% off service work in my email from Randy, he hooked me up with Bruce and Bruce hooked me up with 10% off, good thing cause every penny counts now days. 10% is better then 5%. When I picked up my car one of my windows was still acting up but Bruce had them adjust it while I waited, I sure appreciated it, they had it all done before I left the lot and did have to come back. I was very happen with the service. It all cost me some money but that's my fault for not keeping up the maintenance on it. I love my car and I didn't want some mechanic on the side working on it.

657,"October 04, 2013",I highly recommend Motor City Lexus service.  I have 3 Lexus cars and keep coming back to Motor City Lexus to purchase cars because of the great service.  My service advisor is always friendly and goes out of her way to inform me of everything that is needed on my car if it is something that is not part of the regular mileage service.  They always provide a clean new loaner so I am not without a car when mine is serviced.  My car is ready and washed when promised and if for some reason I need my car in a hurry they go out of their way to have mine done when I need it.  The prices are always fair so when I need new tires or anything else I feel comfortable having Motor City take care of all my car's needs.  I will continue to purchase cars here because of the great serve and buying experience. ,5.0
658,"May 23, 2013","I have to tell you about my overall experience with Lexus of Bakersfield.  Their service goes way beyond what is expected or required of them and over the past 3 years I continue to be surprised by their attitude and  work ethic.  As an example:

When I took my car in for a recall, I was told I needed new tires and was given a price.  I said no thanks (knowing that dealers always ask top price for anything they do) and decided to shop them myself. To cut a long story short I purchased them from the dealership and saved myself almost 50%.  In addition I needed gas when I dropped my vehicle off and knew where I was going to get it after researching through the gas buddy app on my smart phone.  However when I picked the car up the gas tank was full!  We all know this is not a $10-$15 give-a-way with the price of gas today.  The service guy Bruce did not even mention they had done this  so I did not have a chance to thank him or his team.  However, I thought a nice way to show my appreciation would be to let all the people in the area know that if they are even thinking of getting a Lexus either new or used THIS IS THE PLACE TO GET IT.

Oh!  they also gave me a loaner car while mine was being worked on.",5.0

662,"September 11, 2012","After purchasing our ES330 new in 2004, we had recurring problems with the rear windows not working.  After 3 or 4 unsuccessful service attempts, I finally gave up on Motor City Service. However, last week I came in to try to get them fixed prior to selling, or trading in our Lexus. One window was fixed, the other still doesn't work.  Other than the window issue, we have had absolutely no other problems with our ES 330. My wife loves her Lexus and we will be buying another

I have been in contact recently with both our sales person, and the General Manager.  They both seem to be genuinely trying to solve our problems.

We were having a hard time deciding between a ES350 and the RX350 and he was very patient and very knowledgable about giving us details about both options.  Once we made our decision the actual negotiation of the sale was very easy.  While waiting for all transactions to complete, we thoroughly enjoyed the TV area and comfortable leather chairs.  The entire showroom is beautiful and very comfortable.  The final transaction of actually receiving the car was flawless.  Jashan was very thorough at showing us all the details of the car...we still have a lot to learn but he did a great job of giving us the basics!

668,"November 30, 2011","After over a year of research on the type of car I wanted I came to the conclusion that my heart was set on a Lexus IS 250. My husband tried to convince me otherwise and took me to AUDI. They happened to have a Lexus like I wanted and after running some numbers there I was told I was better off leasing a New AUDI. Everytime I left the facility I was forced to take the AUDI with me. I also HATED that everytime I explained that the price was out of my range they brought down the price. The company lost credibility with me and I decided to visit my local LEXUS dealer. I called my father's recommended salesman at Motor city and he then in turn referred me to Jashan at Motor City Lexus. I immediatly loved the service from both guys and the way I was treated. I felt that I was more of a person than just a ""Customer and a Sale."" I ended up getting a great deal on a New Lease and it was terrific. It became one of  the best car buying experiences I have ever had. My daughter, who is three, even knows my salesman by names and thats the type of great experience I recieved. I had two great men who were NOT PUSHY by any means and knew alot about the vehicles that they even trust their loved ones in them. What I liked about Jashan was that he answered his phone at all times even if he wasnt at work and I can appreciate someone who can be there at all times for us. What I liked about Rick is that he was there every step of the way to check in on me and communicated frequently with Jashan on everything that I had going on. I felt really pampered the whole way through. If you are looking for a great deal and a great down to earth guy who can help you I reccomend seeing Jashan at Lexus. The Service At Motor City Lexus is remarkable. I promise you wont be dissapointed. ",5.0
669,"November 22, 2011","I recently purchased a 2012 Lexus RX350 SUV from Motor City of Bakersfield.  They are a great company who excel in knowledgeable and excellent customer service.  It was a joy to do business with Jashan Bal.  He was patient and sensitive while explaining the new Lexus technology to me.  I needed a lot of help because my previous vehicle was very basic.

Jashan made me want to do business with Motor City Lexus because of his customer service skills.  Customer service to me means concern after the sale which he definitely excelled in.  He set up an appointment for a return visit after I had driven my vehicle a few days, I did have additional questions.  He programed my cell phone, radio and garage opener.  My daughter didn't receive this detailed service with her new car purchase two years ago from a different car dealer.  He gave me his cell phone number and advised me to contact him anytime with my questions.

I have received several follow up calls from Jashan to ensure I'm a satisfied customer; now that's concern after the sale.  I would definitely recommend Motor City Lexus to my family and friends.  I'm a very happy customer!",5.0
