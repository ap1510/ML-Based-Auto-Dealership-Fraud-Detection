1,"January 03, 2020","This was our second purchase of a Hyundai, The first was purchased at another dealer, and we did eventually have a good experience after several visits and much haggling on price. I walked out of the first dealership a few times because of poor customer service, but it was close to where we live, and they had the model I wanted. This time we traveled to Central Valley Hyundai because of their inventory and competitive pricing. Our sales rep Olliver wasn't pushy or fake, and just made everything really easy to deal with. When it came to our trade in I was ready to argue, but nope, again fair and easy. I'm not used to purchasing a vehicle on the first visit to a dealership, but I had no reason to walk out this time! Not only that, but finance said we would be done in a half hour, and he came through. I can definitely recommend Central Valley to anyone looking to buy a vehicle.",4.8
2,"December 14, 2019","It was a great experience. We had visited many dealerships, and you guys really stood out from the rest. The minute we got there we were greeted by a salesman (Moe). We told him what we were looking for, and what he could do for us, and he immediately took us to look at some cars. We went to his office and looked at his computer. He had a car to look at, and he went to get the car himself, so that we didn't have to walk. That was nice. He offered us beverages. We bought the car he showed us, and are very happy with it. We were first looking for a 2019 model, but he showed us, and made it possible for us to own a brand new 2020 car. Thank you for the wonderful service. ",5.0
3,"November 30, 2019",My purchase experience with Hyundai was great. I got all the features on the vehicle i wanted including the price that fit my budget.

4,"October 22, 2019","I went to the Hyundai dealership to look at a New Hyundai Sonata that was listed on line. I had never purchased a Hyundai previously, but was greeted by Luis Casapia who was friendly and knowledgeable. During the test drive he pointed out different features on the car. I was able to drive to my residence do make sure the car would be comfortable for a family member. He has continued to keep in touch to help answer any questions I might have. Others at the dealership were also very kind and helpful. ",5.0
5,"September 11, 2019","Greg is a gift given to this world. The lord brought him to this earth and he has blessed us with his presence and his generosity. We could not be more happy with the service he provided us. He went to infinity and beyond to provide us with the utmost care. He met our every request, need and demand. The world does not deserve Greg, for he is the most wonderful man. Eternally grateful! ",5.0

8,"April 15, 2019","Bought a used 2016 Subaru Outback from CVVH on 3/25/19 that I later found out had a faint rod knock (major engine prob). My $6K down-payment check was cashed by them on 3/27/19 and I returned the car on 3/30/19 (via the 5-day ""contract-cancellation"" agreement), Upon return, my wife and I were presented with a ""cancellation document"" that we were asked to sign. Trustingly, we both signed w/o reading the exact language (foolish me/us!).

A week later, having not yet received a refund, I looked at the document more carefully and realized that it said, ""I/we hereby acknowledge  RECEIPT of a complete refund of all monies or other consideration previously paid by me/us.........."". HUH?? I called to talk with my salesman ""Moe"" and was connected with ""sales manager"" Chris Gonzalez, who said that it would take 9 days to ""process"" (??) my refund. But, after pointing out the language of the document we had signed, he agreed to ""expedite"" the refund.

Soooo.......ANOTHER week (4/15/19) and FIVE CALLS later, I was unable to reconnect with Chris, but was finally able to get in touch with another so-called ""sales manager"" 'Domingo' (first or last name? DUNNO), who - after I threatened to call the district attorney - claimed he would put the check in the mail that afternoon (today). BUT, even if he does.......apparently I won't actually receive my refund until 18-ish days after signing the document stating that I acknowledged having already received it!! 

 NOT the way to do business!! Ray Casner, Placerville, CA",1.0

11,"February 15, 2019","Saw A hyundai Tuscon for 20k, got interested so I filled out the form and got $207/moth for payment with my trade in, next thing i know the sales guy tells me there was a software glitch and MSRP posted on the site is wrong. Typical BS to get customer's contacting them then they tried to cut me a deal for a different car and for a higher payment. My advice.. STAY AWAY .. integrity and ethics is what wins trusts",1.0

13,"July 31, 2018","I must give it to Central Valley Hyundai for my new purchase of a 2018 Hyundai Sonata SEL and for hiring such a great salesman. I had Mohammed Salem and could not have had a better person to make me as comfortable as possible with my purchase. He was honest, polite, and informative to the tee. He made it feel as if my family was selling me the car. He also came in on his day off to finalize the purchase and to me that showed the commitment to his customer and his job meant something to him. It meant something to me to have the same person from start to finish during the process show the same level of professionalism. Once again thank you hyundai for hiring a great staff and most importantly Mohammed Salem. See you on our next purchase.",5.0

Casey the Sales Manage nice guy, he had to shepherd the whole thing through.

529,"August 10, 2015",My sales person was Kenny B. . Kenny B. went over and beyond and even came in on his day off for me.  Kenny came to my house to see if a certain vehicle I was wanting would fit in my garage and be the right car for my son regarding measurements as my son is handicap.  Kenny came to my home after the sale to set up the garage door opener option in my car as I could not do it.  I would refer business to Kenny along with coming back to him for my next car. I was not the easiest client to work with and Kenny kept it professional that whole way through the process.  ,4.6

547,"June 03, 2015","This new car purchase was a pleasant experience for a change!  The internet salesman compared the Costco Auto program and TrueCar for us and we ended up using the Costco program for more savings.  The salesmen and sales manager were very professional and straightforward.  The specific vehicle we wanted was hard to find, but they were able to find it and deliver it to our home.  The sales manager even found a Hyundai rebate coupon to cover the cost of transporting the vehicle.  After delivery of the vehicle, the salesman spent time explaining the features even though it was late in the evening and he was an hour and a half from home.
Excellent customer service!",5.0

550,"May 26, 2015",I attempted to buy at my local dealer in Merced however this became a game real quick. I call Central Valley in Modesto. I glad I did I spoke with Kenny and he delivered. First I called he text me the sticker price and we communicated back and forth for about 20 minutes than I called and got all the details. We decided to drive to see this unbelievable deal. When we got there Kenny met us and had the car pulled up took us on a test drive and made us feel like family. Kenny than went over everything again and there were no hidden things. It was just the way he had told us over the phone and texting back and forth. Than while I was waiting I met Steve another sales person. Steve wanted to make sure we were happy and comfortable. Alex in finance did not pressure us to buy anything we didn't want to. And explained every thing perfectly. Than Kenny has kept up his end of the deal. He calls at least once every couple of weeks to ensure we are still happy and to cover any questions we have on the car.,5.0

552,"May 12, 2015","We were contacted last week about something called the ""Customer Exchange Program"" by Kenny. At first we were extremely skeptical, as we had only had our car for a few years, and had purchased it new at that time. The offer that they were talking about seemed to be too good to be true, and that usually means that it is. But it was a lazy Saturday, and we decided to head out to the dealership to see what exactly the offer entailed. After talking with Kenny for just a few moments, and looking at the newest model cars, we decided that the program sounded interesting enough to go ahead and see what they could offer us. After going through the credit process, we were delighted to find that not only could we upgrade to a brand new car with more options than the one that we currently had, but we also did it with $0 down, a much better APR than before, and a lower monthly payment. This program is AMAZING, and if you ever have the opportunity to participate, it could definitely be well worth your time. It was for us! Thank you so much!!!",5.0
