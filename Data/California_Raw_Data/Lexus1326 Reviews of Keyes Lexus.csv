369,"November 30, 2018","I have purchased or leased numerous vehicles over the years.  
 
Without a doubt, the leasing experience with Ider in the Internet Sales Department of Keyes Lexus in Van Nuys CA was the easiest, least stressful and most satisfying. 
 
During our series of emails, Ider was able to provide us with exactly the vehicle we wanted at a price that was very attractive and reasonable, especially compared to other dealers.  He never applied any pressure to decide sooner than we wished,  or to purchase more than we wanted.   He was extremely responsive and never changed his quoted lease deal, despite changes in circumstances. 
 
When they sold the original car we wanted, he found an identical one from another dealer with every detail we preferred in time for our lease meeting. 
 
Before the vehicle delivery process, Ider sent us the lease documents in advance by email for our approval.  So, when we arrived at Keyes, the vehicle, lease documents,  and DMV materials were all ready, so we wasted no time in the dealership.   The vehicle was prepped and in impeccable condition.   Ider was diligent, prompt, careful, responsive and professional in explaining every aspect of the Lexus NX300. 
 
In short, we could not have asked for a more capable automobile lease or purchase experience with a focus on customer service. Every aspect was performed in an excellent manner. Everyone we dealt with in this first rate company was helpful, responsive, reasonable and customer service oriented to make this entire vehicle process with minimum stress.  If you are considering a luxury vehicle purchase or lease in the LA area, it would be a mistake to not visit Keyes Lexus and Ider in particular . ",5.0

Arshak is the only name you need to know, ask for him and everything will be taken care of correctly and efficiently.  I had a negative experience at another Lexus dealership and came to Keyes because they were the closest dealer to my home.  Arshak was the first person I spoke with and the last.  He took careful note of any and all of my concerns about my vehicle's needs, documented a clear order for the service techs and set me up with another Lexus loaner car.  All of the service records were sent to me via email and I was able to follow real time updates regarding the service completion.  When the car was ready, Arshak met with me in his office, discussed the line by line updates and remedies and walked me to my freshly washed car as it was ready to go.

Arshak shook my hand when we met and when I left, he's been in the service business for a very long time and takes serious concern for a genuine customer experience and relationship.

Other than a few different Service Tech's. at the very beginning, Anthony Pastoral, has taken exceptionally good care of ""Black Beauty"", as my wife calls the car.  She has been driving it since we traded in our 1998 GS-400 on this beautiful automobile, and we still love this car.  
Although, we purchased this vehicle from the same Lexus dealer we purchased our '98 Lexus from, and within the first 60 days our battery died for no apparent reason.  I contacted the dealer, and spoke to a service tech, and was shocked by the response I received from this service tech.  Right then and there, I said that's it, I'll never let them service this vehicle again.  That's when I called the service department at Keyes Lexus, which handed me over to a service tech whose name has disappeared from my memory at present.  After explaining my battery problem to him, he had the following words for me, "" Give me your address and I'll have a service man bring a new battery to your home and get you started"".  Within an hour, the service man arrived and had me going in less than 15 minutes.  I have been taking my car to them ever since and boy am I glad!  Thanks Keyes!

Worst I could say is that the pastries in the waiting lounge were not as good as last time! Also the 4 computers available for use were really just one, the other 3 did not work and no one had the thought to either fix them or put a sign on them until I complained about them. 

ON the other hand, because my tires were too worn to rotate them, and we did not do an oil service this time, no one thought to re-set the notices on the dashboard, has to ask in the service driveway.

However, a salesperson named Carina called and left two messages on my cell while my car was being repaired,  not indicating that she was, in fact, trying to sell me a new car, or get me to trade mine in. I do not appreciate being solicited when I am having my car serviced, and, what was egregious, is that she asked me to call her back! This made me assume she was from the service dept. and that something was wrong with my car and that therefore she was contacting me. I called her back, or tried to, and could not reach her.  (I had assumed she was in the Service Dept.) . All of this took 15 minutes of my time, and a while longer for the agency to figure out that no, not service, but sales had contacted me.

Despite many pushes by Mike Nazari and my multiple complaints, Enterprise has not fully credited back my account as of today (2018-01-10)..

Contacted Sam Santos for an appt. Sam introduced me to Alan Kwok who recently joined the Internet Group. Alan was very helpful in selecting a car that I would be happy with. Followed up with me.

I was searching for an RX350 F-Sport for a few months.  I was notified via a website that you had just the car I was looking for.  I contacted your sales staff and informed them of the price I would be willing to pay and stated how little time I had to deal with the typical car buying process.  

They quickly helped me, and we reached an agreement over the phone.  Within minutes, they sent me the documentation needed to get the process rolling.  I had given them the information they needed, and reiterated how fast I had to make this happen upon arrival at your dealership.  I had to be in and out in under 30 minutes for me to make a meeting later that night in Ventura, driving in from Orange County.

In retrospect, I was a bit challenging.  But, once I was at the dealership, your team had everything ready to move fast - the car was fueled up, newly washed, and the process in the finance office went very smoothly.   As a business owner, it is extremely clear you have a team that cares about the customer and will go the extra mile to give your customers an outstanding experience.  

To John and Jose, thank you very much for dealing with such a direct and demanding customer so well.  You guys are clearly a cut above others in the market!

Generally everything with him was fine - he didn't really try and sell me on anything as I was already there to get a new car.  He had to go to Glendale to get the car for me and took a really long time (like 2 hours). I was disappointed that he didn't point out to me that heated seats are not standard on the IS as it's standard on every other base model Lexus, but of course I didn't realize this until after I had already left.  I expressed my concerns and Chris Darby called and was really helpful and accommodating - he swapped me out vehicles to one that had the heated/ventilated seat function and upgraded me to one with a navigation system (which the previous one did not have).  I dealt with Myra when I came back to swap the vehicles and she was really sweet and thorough explaining everything and did her best to get me in and out quickly.

844,"September 05, 2017","We purchased our sixth Lexus at Keyes. Ultimately their price was the best but most importantly their service under Alan Pliss is spectacular which keeps us coming back.this is additionally the third vehicle we have obtained from Steve Wolpa who is the consumate professional. 

The reasons for the four star rating is twofold. 

We were informed they would give us a good price for our  Lexus that we were trading or selling which is a LS 460 in excellent shape and very low mileage that we have always serviced there. Instead of that they low balled us far, far below any value and we felt that their appraisal was not honest and was attempting to take advantage of a long term customer. CarMax actually offered us thousands more and one other dealership did as well. This is not how you treat your long term customers. Staff actually had to apologize and were embarrassed. That experience almost caused me to cancel the acquisition of my new car through Keyes, but the relationships with Alan Pliss and Steve Wolpa, are the only thing that kept us purchasing a car from Keyes when that happened.  

Second, a couple or few days after our acquisition of the car, we received a nice congratulatory letter for using Keyes with some type of purchase certification via e mail. Unfortunately they had the wrong model purchased and the wrong photo of our car. When I discussed with the dealership they apologized and indicated they didn't have that mode in their computer program so sent out a photo and a description (written) of the closest model they had in their system for congratulations. This is very unprofessional for an otherwise professional business like Keyes Lexus. Either put the right model in your system OR don't sent out a letter confusing your customers as to what they purchased. Rather silly and dismaying. A new customer or an old customer should never have to take the time to call the dealership to make certain the car we were congratulated on receiving was the same car they had in their records. .

971,"June 07, 2017","Somewhere, I got the impression that when you are having your car serviced, closing time is 7 pm.  I don't know where I got this idea but I did, and with the long summer evenings, it was still very bright when I arrived at the Van Nuys dealership in a dither.  Not only was closing time not at 7, but in my rush to get through the horrendous evening traffic, I got off of the 405 Freeway North and continued down Sepulveda -- but not Beverly Glen, as I had intended.  That then put me on Sepulveda instead of Van Nuys, a mistake many of us make; but in my case I have been making this mistake for over 40 years of living in the San Fernando Valley.  Only when I arrived in Panorama City did I realized that I had not really 'passed' the Lexus dealer, which I thought was just closing at 7 pm,, I was actually on the wrong street.  The dealership is on Van Nuys, the street which empties off of Beverly Glen.  Do I sound confused?  Oh, would someone please tell me that they understand and that they too have confused Sepulveda Blvd with Van Nuys Blvd.  I also had my GPS navigation map on the whole time, but I was really listening to the ""Children's Corner Suite"" by Claude Debussy.  So at exactly 7 pm, I realized that it was going to take me another 15 minutes to go east from Sepulveda to Van Nuys and then south to the dealership, if they were still waiting for me -- a bit absurd I know, but the music was so soothing that I didn't seem to mind and was really doing the best I could to get there by 7.

When I finally arrived at the dealership to return my rental car, all the offices were open, with all their lights on -- but there was not a soul in sight. How much stranger could this get? I wondered.  The Debussy had ended and I noticed someone in the dealership area.  So I parked right at the curb and went in, not wasting a moment because it was now 7:20 pm!

At the desk I ran into Melissa; dear, dear Melissa.  I told her that I was trying to return my rental and retrieve my own Lexus, but there was no one in the Service offices.  ""Oh,"" Melissa said, ""Everyone has gone home.  we close at 6 pm.  But let me try to call someone to help you.""  What a pleasant and na√Øve idea, that she was going to try to find someone to help me.  Stupid me!  The Debussy nitwit!  I even heard a voice in my head say, ""Why on Earth would she even do that?""  But she made me feel that she had nothing better to do than to actually help this simpleton get his own car back at this hour.

""Let me try to get someone to cover this reception desk for me so that I can try to help you.""  ""Thanks very much.  I really appreciate your help.  Is there a Men's Room nearby?  I have been driving for over an hour in traffic trying to get here before you closed.  So I am very happy that there is anyone here at all to help me.""

When I returned to the desk, I was just starting to think coherently  again.  ""Let's go to Mike's desk,"" she said, ""to see if perhaps he has left the keys to your car on his desk.""  My next thoughts were : ""I wish I had Melissa working for me."" She certainly is clear thinking.""   No luck finding the keys at his desk.  ""Let's try the billing office to look in the basket for any remaining serviced vehicles,"" she volunteered.  Bingo.  There they were.  ""If you could give me your credit card, I can check you out.  Meanwhile, I'll call the garage downstairs to ask if someone is still there to bring your car up.  And I can take the keys for your rental car.""  Bing, bang, boom.

I was so impressed, and managed to recover my composure.  I thanked Melissa profusely.  And she said, ""You are very welcome and don't forget to take a chocolate chip cookie with you if there is still one left.""  I was speechless - and very grateful.  

I even forgot to tell Melissa that my 2016 300H was the fourth Lexus I have owned, having driven only Lexus's for the past 20 years.  I bought my first one from my friend Aly, who was having trouble ending a leasing deal for his new Lexus prematurely because his daughter had just been accepted to UCLA Law School and he couldn't afford both..  She is now a successful lawyer.  And I am still a devoted Lexus fan.(notwithstanding the GPS system and the woman that only says ""Pardon"" ""Pardon"" ""Pardon"")

News to me is that Keyes is authorized to do smog checks and via internet ships the result to Sacramento so all you do is pay DMV by check or over the web.

Sure beats taking the old car to a specific smog check place and sitting there, biting nails, hoping it passes.  No problem this time as I didn't know until after the fact that the smog check had just been done.  Perfect.  And the price was the same as at any other ""smog check only"" outfit.

Anthony is personable and very professional and a delight to work with.  I was very happy with everything done this past week...

1033,"February 29, 2016","I leased my first Lexus ES350 Jan of 2013 from Keys. It was a 2 year lease, and together with it I bought a ""Protection Plan"" that I was told would cover up to $7,500 worth of wear and damage. I rarely drive so my car was in pristine condition and with only 3,000 miles, however, it had a crack on the windshield (which was covered by the protection). In December of 2015, a month or so before my lease was up, I went in Keys Lexus to discuss getting me on a new lease and out of the old one. After a lot of back and forth, we agreed on a price, and I was told that ""they would take care of the old lease and all I had to do was to cancel any automatic payments"". I handed them the old keys - they handed me the new keys, and I was on my way. At that time, I only gave them one set of keys because I couldn't find the second one - I was told that they'll take care of it and I had nothing to worry about... that I should just enjoy my new car. 

Fast forward to two weeks ago, mid-February, I receive a bill for $1,500 claiming excessive wear and use of my old lease from Lexus Financial. I was surprised to receive any type of bill, since I was told that it was taken care of, so I called Keys. I was told that the manager was not in (it was the weekend) and that I should call Lexus Financial and see what it was because I shouldn't have to pay for anything since I had the protection. 

I was obviously frustrated, but assumed that it was just the windshield so I called them to clear it out and move on. Apparently they didn't know I had the protection plan - they said that they'll remove that charge but that I still owe about $500 because I have to pay for ""sales tax for the windshield"" and for a ""missing key"". I immediately called Keys Lexus and asked them to sort it out because I shouldn't have to pay anything as we discussed - I was told that the person who sold me the car was no longer working there and that the lease agreement was between me and Lexus Financial so there was nothing they could do. I spoke with Karim who was the manager of the old salesperson and he told me that ""keys are the customer's responsibility"" which of course makes sense.. but when you are told that a Lexus dealership will take care of your old Lexus lease and they get you in your new Lexus lease then you expect that they'll honor that and won't claim that it's not their problem after they get your business. 

I had to chase Karim down and call over and over again, after he kept claiming that he would call me the next day and didn't 3 times in a row. At the end, he said that it was my responsibility and there was nothing they would do to honor what was told to me by their salesperson when I closed the deal. 

I feel taken, slightly disrespected, and above all disappointed at how some businesses treat loyal customers - both leases were from Keys... imagine what they'd do to new customers.",1.0
1034,"February 01, 2016","10 STARS*******  Bought my 3rd GX last week and I LOVE IT!!!!!  I am beyond happy with the customer service and the deal. Linda Barrera was superb!  I had to wait a while since the car was out of stock for over a month.  She was patient with my calls, informative, found the car I wanted and made sure everything went smooth with my purchase and trade in.  I also dealt with managers Kalei and Robert who were both very professional and friendly, made sure I was happy with my purchase.  Prior to this purchase I was a frequent visitor at Lexus Van Nuys for service and must say the service manager Alan is the best!!! He is very helpful, professional and solves issues with class and proper manner.  Thank you

The purchase and pick-up of the car went very smoothly.

1115,"March 20, 2015","The ABSOLUTE WORST auto experience of my life.. My second lease form them and its been nothing but problems from the start. First they said they would pay to black my windows, after 4 un returned phone calls, I finally had to go back to Keyes and threaten to return the car to get that done. Next salesman Emad and sales manager Joey told it was OK to return my spare key and cover from my outgoing car leased from them in a week. I did that. Then I get 1500 dollar bill from Lexus financial for the items. First Keyes denied I returned them, I had a receipt proving I did, I e mailed them my copy, they still denied it. LIE # 1. After finally admitting that I did actually return them, they said I returned them late, thats the reason for the charge. My wife is in the airline industry and was gone with the  spare key and wouldnt be back for 5 days, I made this very clear at the time of purchase. Both ""salesman"" said no problem, you have 7 days to return them. LIE # 2. I finally had to call Lexus Dealer Complaint to resolve the issue. The district manager finally resolved the issue with Keyes. They returned his calls....never mine. This ordeal took 7 phone calls 4 emails, hours of time on hold  trying to reach someone who could make Keyes admit THEY LOST my materials and then wanted me to pay for it. Finally after 32, days more calls and wasted time the district manger stepped in and made Keyes honor the commitment.
AVOID THIS DEALERSHIP AT ALL COST. Purchase a BMW we have never had a problem with them. I will never go back to Keyes Lexus, they are a mistake waiting to happen who run for cover when caught and refuse to admit the made a mistake.",1.2

2 days after, we went there to get a CT but asking for a better deal because price he told me that day was so different from the first day (i guess he knew we wanted the car that's why he took advantage). and i guess haggling for a price is normal when you're buying a car knowing how very tricky these car sales people are (nothing wrong about that i know it's their job) and then suddenly told me ""i think you shouldn't be buying a Lexus"". me and my wife felt insulted. it felt like he was telling us... you don't have the money, go somewhere else you could afford a car. 

today i called the Ryan (General Manager) because i felt like he should know what kind of people he have but it seems that he does not want to listen that's why i'm here writing this review. 

we were ready to buy that CT that moment he finally said he cannot go any lower but Ben's last few words made us leave.
he was very rude!

1194,"December 27, 2013","There is a sales named ‚ÄúKaalan‚Äù in Keyes Lexes, he provided me the false information so it lead me to make a wrong decision. 
At the beginning, I was still thinking purchasing a car or leasing a car, but he told us that even if I were to make the lease, in two years, IF I WOULD BE ABLE TO PURCHASE AND PAY OFF THE CAR WITHIN 10 DAYS I WOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY SALES TAX.   He was very sure about what he said and he even said it‚Äôs the government‚Äôs law. So after he told us this, I decided to make the lease agreement instead of the purchase.
After the purchase, I found out what he said was not true and it actually cost about $1200 more for me to make a lease agreement instead of making the purchase. Because I do have to pay sales tax even if I purchase the car in two years within 10 days.  I just feel so upset about this purchase. He told me false information and misleads me to sign the lease agreement.  I have already sign the contracts, so I know I can‚Äôt do much about this.  But I still gave it a try and contacted them and said I just want to change to a purchase instead of leasing but no one replies me. I even sent an email to their VIP Manager.  I truly feel  unhappy and unsatisfied about this experience with such irresponsible car dealer who give false information.   I hope their wrongful and irresponsible act will be recognized so no more consumers will have the same experience as I did.

1226,"November 06, 2012","Where do I start?  

After storming off the lot at Center Acura, we drove up Van Nuys Blvd and decided to check out an IS350 at Keyes.  Not knowing of Keyes prior it was purely out of convenience (and my terrible experience at Center) that we stopped.  I was in-between an Acura TL-SH or an IS350.  From the moment we stepped on the lot it was a great experience.

We were greeted by Gayle Rachtman who was greatly helpful, likeable, and easy-going.  I was in search of an IS350, 2012 or newer.  We test drove a stellar graphite CPO that was perfect but, it just wasn't EXACTLY what I wanted.  We perused the lot with 2012 models and 2013.  I fell in love with a white F Sport IS350.  

From Gayle we went over and worked with Joey Yerkanyan.  It was the first dealership EVER who sit you down and talk numbers straight with the sales manager.  Typically the sales person plays good cop, runs off to talk to a guy in a far off room who says ""yay"" or ""nay"" to your offer.  Here, I worked straight with the man making the decisions.  We worked it out to where I was comfortable, with the least amount of haggling, all straight talk.  Discounts were flying and I was showered with perks.  This was probably the easiest, smoothest transaction ever experienced at a car dealership.  We took a break, grabbed some food, and came back to Joey who had thrown together a few more discounts.

From there we moved upstairs to Rod Makou.  He was enjoyable to work with, which made signing my life away that much easier.  

Everyone I met at Keyes had a great personality and was a joy to work with.  I would highly suggest this dealership to anyone who wanted a great experience.  Not to mention; the cookies, coffee, and fruit are top notch! Ah, in addition they just sent me a custom video of MY new car...genius!

1229,"October 29, 2012","Five years ago, after being humbled, humilated, and put down by other dealerships, my husband and I walked into the Keyes Lexus dealership thinking we could drop and in and just look. We were upside-down with a Chevy Tahoe. The lease was up and I just assumed we could turn it in and get another car. Wrong! We owed thousands! Everyone, including many Ford and Chevrolet dealerhsips, quoted us astronomical lease payments.Other luxury car places just laughed at us. By the end of the day, we were weary and just wanted to look, or dream, about having a Lexus. 

Right away, Elia Shapiro welcomed us. Without any pressure, he asked us what we would like. We told him, but not in full sentences. We were embarassed, afraid---scared of being berrated. We told him our situation, said that we had good credit and nice personalities, but that was about it. We couldn't afford to pay more and we certainly couldn't come up with alot of money down. 
Moments later Elia came back and said ""What if I could take your car, get you a new car and keep the same payments?"" 

Wow!How was this possible? How could he do this? I thought I was dreaming!

That day we realized that anything was possible! Elia took care of us, treated us with respect, enthusiasm, humor and joy. He got us a new Lexus-- a better car and for less money-- better than any other dealership!!
 
Since that time, we have returned to Elia twice, for a lease and most recently a purchase. He definitely makes miracles happen. And his sales team are just as courteous and professional as he is.

I always enjoy coming into this Keyes Lexus dealership. It's different, beautiful, classy and welcoming. I can't imagine getting a Lexus anywhere else.

Additionally, Mania Alexandrian made our buying experience a joy. She's truly an asset for the Lexus sales team-- very poised and professional. Rod Makou, too,in finance, welcomed us like family--very effecient, patient, thorough and kind. No pressure from anyone.
Thank you Elia, Mania and Rod for making the unexpected happen! I have always wanted a Lexus Rx...and once again, you made an idea into reality!Thank you for everything!

1238,"October 07, 2012","Purchase lease on 2013 RX 350 Keyes Lexus. 10-06-2012

Keyes took advantage of our desire to avoid personal conflict with the sales staff and ‚ÄúWalk‚Äù.        

At every step of what should have been a very easy transaction Keyes sales management (Joey Yerkanyan) Lied about what RX350‚Äôs they had available with the options we had originally requested. As we discovered this cascade of ongoing misrepresentations about the features installed on the RX we were forced into repeated renegotiations.

After we made the long drive into Van Nuys because Keyes said they ‚Äúhad the car with the features we had very carefully specified in stock‚Äù this turned into a very unnecessary 4 hours of ‚Äúused Car sales tactics‚Äù.

Driving home the bad taste in our mouths about finalizing a deal with a dealer which employs such dishonest tactics made us decide to return the car the next day and cancel the deal. Unfortunately the Lexus Lease contract we signed has a ‚ÄúNO Cooling OFF‚Äù clause. After 4 hours we were a little too impatient to leave and didn‚Äôt check all the fine print.

After checking around about Keyes more thoroughly with other Lexus dealers it is clear LEXUS is willing to turn a blind eye to the Keyes sales treatment of Lexus customers as long as they move their products off the lot. We can only assume all the Keyes Auto dealer sites employ the same tactics. Our advice is never walk on a Keyes lot because you will regret it.

I had questions regarding the availability and the price and had indicated to her that I had a specific budget which the current listed price was not meeting.  I informed her that I had just started my car search and would keep the car on my list.  I provided Mania with my contact info.

Mania was very dilligent in follow up with me regarding the specific Lexus that I had inquired on and also advised of newly posted Lexus for sale within my budget.  She was dilligent, but not the bit pushy.  Mania was always pleasant and never pressured me.

I evenutall went into the dealership to look at the car and to take it for a test drive with me. Being the first time I test drove the GS 350 model, Mania was very informative and knowledgable in pointing out the key features that I was interested in: back up camera & sensor, Navi system, Bluetooth - how to set up and use.  We actually linked it on my iPhone and called a friend.

During the test drive, Mania was very pleasant and answered general questions I had like what a certified Lexus entailed, the benefits I would get if I purchased the car at Keyes Lexus, and reputation and availability of the Keyes service dept.

After the test drive, Mania spoke with her manager regarding my interest in the car.  Even though her manager was not able to meet my offer price, Mania was very understanding that I did not purchase the car at the moment.

The weeks after my test drive, Mania kept in contact with follow up phone calls on how my car search was going, informing me of any updates on the car I was interested in, and ideas on other possible/suggestive cars.   Again, Mania was very pleasant, professional and applied no pressure at all during her diligent follow up.

I eventually bought another car (different brand - not Lexus).  I notified Mania as a courtesy and she was genuinely happy for me!  

As a Service Relationship Manager for a big financial company, I am very critical of customer service of any kind.  

Mania more than passed my test.  She is the ultimate professional, very knowledgeable, friendly, has great follow up skills, and very genuine.

Because of Mania, I would say that my experience at Keyes Lexus was definitely 5 stars ! I would definitely recommend Mania to anybody looking for a great experience at Keyes Lexus

1246,"August 17, 2012","I had a so, so experience here.  In the end, I think I got a great car for a good price.

Here's what happened:  I bought a used 2009 Honda Fit here that was a trade-in.  I bought it for ~$1500 less than it was worth on KBB because I think they wanted to get rid of it.  They wouldn't bargain with me much but they weren't overly pushy salesman either.  JR was great and I don't remember the other guy's name but wasn't overly push either which I appreciated.  They had nice coffee, cookies fruit etc. up for grabs which is a nice touch.  

THEN the deal was made and I was taken to the finance department.  Arezu was pushing all the extras, which was to be expected but the kicker was when she told me that a $350 ""theft code"" (whatever that means) was included in the price.  I wanted to confirm that she meant included in the price that I agreed upon with the sales team and she said yes.  So we continued signing all the papers and the end price ended up being about $300-400 more than I thought it would be.  That may not seem like a lot compared to the total price of the car but I had working toward buying this car for a long time and that was no small amount of money for me.  So I asked here where that extra money came from and of course after crunching EVERY little fee, I realized it was in the little extras, she had charged me for the ""theft code.""  

I am so glad I calculated everything again.  When I asked her about this fee, she was all about making me think I agreed to purchase it when I clearly did not.  I had clearly told her I didn't want to purchase a theft code if it was not already included in the price I had agreed upon with the sales team.  It was SO annoying because Arezu obviously tried to sneak in that charge and be tricky with her verbiage to make me think I misunderstood her. 

So whatever, we signed all the papers without purchasing the stupid ""theft code"" and they finally handed me my keys.  I was completely exhausted after the finance discussion with Arezu because I felt like I had to read every little bit of fine print to make sure she wasn't trying to sneak anything else past me.  I got into the car and realized there were no floormats in the vehicle. I asked Sammy, the salesman, about this and his exact words were ""Well you test drove the car without the mats didn't you?  You should have asked then.""  GRRR way to ruin my first car buying experience, Keyes Lexus!  I didn't even feel like arguing with the guy so I drove the car home sans mats and decided that because I got a good deal on the purchase, I should just buy the mats myself.  

A couple of days later I got an email from Keyes Lexus welcoming me to their ""family"" and saying things like my satisfaction means a lot to them, blah blah blah.  After reading this, I decided to see if they actually meant it.  I wasn't hopeful but wrote back to the customer service representative about the missing mats, and low and behold, JR the original salesman I worked with that made the deal with me called me back to get my mailing address. He was going to mail me new Honda mats!  Of course, I had to threaten to write bad reviews for them online before I got such a positive response but I got what I wanted nonetheless.  

Later I had the car looked at with my mechanic and he said it was in great condition.  

So bottom line, I got a great car for a good price but I really had to advocate for myself to ensure that I didn't get cheated by these guys.  Expect that they will try to get away with things like they did with me.  If you can handle that, you'll likely get a qualify product from them in the end because they really really care about their reputation, especially their online reputation.",3.3

He was polite from the minute we stepped onto the Keyes Lexus showroom by showing us the differences between the selection of models. He was extremely knowledgeable using the specifications of every car and assured us he would match the costs we were provided by competitors without the BS (and he was right!). My mom and I hate haggling back and forth the managers & salespersons -- it's a waste of my time and theirs, so just cut me the best deal you can give and let's sign the papers. He understood what we wanted, what we could afford and made it happen. It was the little things that made it worthwhile for me. Even when we wanted to change the color of the interior, he still insisted we take it for a test drive, even though the model itself hadn't changed, but the color, he wanted us to feel comfortable in the car itself.

We bought the vehicles at the end of day and Edmund stuck around that evening after we signed the papers. While we waited for the finance papers, he showed us all the nifty features such as the blue tooth capabilities and how to set it up, where the spare tools had been located, how to use all of the electronics lexus had to offer. He went over all of the warranties listed in the manual including roadside assistance. And at the very end, when we went to pick up the cars, he had it ready with a gigantic red bow tie on top and provided to take a few pictures for me.

1280,"March 22, 2011","About a year ago, Lexus announced their new CT 200h hybrid hatchback would be coming out the following year. I did my research then and became obsessed with the car. I had recently totaled my first Lexus, a 2007 Lexus RX350, which saved my life, so I figured I'd go with Lexus again.

I did my research and finalized my pricing decisions.

As time went on, it looked like Lexus was not going to supply the US with many of these CT 200h's; most were slated for the European markets. That, coupled with rising gas prices anticipated this summer, along with the tragic disaster that struck Japan, many dealerships were not only not willing to sell below MSRP, but were also starting to mark up their cars.

I spoke with Sam Santoso, Internet manager, over email on several occasions. He told me he would beat any best offer I received from other dealerships.

Keyes Lexus, which is literally a 5 minute walk from my house, was one of many dealerships I actually stepped into to make a deal. I had my numbers ready and was ready to deal. They didn't have the car I wanted exactly, so I moved up and decided to get the fully loaded one they had on their lot. I believe I went in on Tuesday, 3/15/11. Sam, the internet manager was leaving, so he said hi to me and passed me onto a sales associate. The sales associate was young and probably new, but we connected because of our age. Unfortunately, when it came time to deal, the sales associate had to pass us onto a more experienced sales manager, who played games and refused to sell us the car at below MSRP, which the internet manager had me believe we could make a deal. This was after weeks of dealing with several dealerships in the area. I was getting frustrated and fed up with the whole game. I would either get this car at the end of the month, or wait until the 2012 one came out so I could get a used one. 

The problem with Keyes Lexus is multifold.

They foist a bunch of dealer-added accessory onto all their cars, and they don't give you the option of removing such add ons. Keyes Lexus is known to chrome ALL wheels of their new cars in stock. In fact, this is such a widespread problem that when other dealerships want to trade stock, the have to exchange the wheels as well, since Keyes does not stock unchromed factory wheels.

Additionally, the sales managers seem to like to play games and do the whole runaround the customer. I was on the defensive the entire time I was in the dealership, which is unfortunate. Whether you've done your research or not, the sales managers will always find a way to make you feel inferior and will actually get so offended when you offer a starting price that is below MSRP. They need to understand that for an entry-level car like the CT 200h, they shouldn't be expecting major profits as they normally would with their higher-end models. I ended up walking out feeling frustrated, disappointed, and insulted.

On Friday, 3/18, Larry Ellis of Vista Lexus in Woodland Hills got in contact with me to see how I was doing. I offered my price, but it was too low. However, the one thing Larry did right was to actually negotiate with me until we could both find a number that we would both be happy with. There was also a $1000 Lexus Loyalty Rebate that Larry was able to dig up and qualify me for, which none of the dealerships I talked to even mentioned. In the end, Larry was able to get me the car I wanted for $1500 off MSRP, fully loaded except for PCS/radar cruise control.

The whole deal took 1 hour, which consisted of me filling out paperwork. Larry and I made a verbal contract over the phone prior to this and he stood by his word and did not try to pull any fast tricks on me when I actually arrived to his dealership a few minutes late due to LA traffic.

The icing on the cake was, Keyes Lexus tried calling me 6 times while I was filling out paperwork. When I was in the office w/ Roger, who is excellent, btw, I finally picked up my phone and Sam, the internet sales manager who passed me off at Keyes Lexus asked me if I wanted to come in to deal. I happily told him I was at Vista Lexus filling out the paperwork for my new CT 200h and that he was too late.

It's a shame Keyes Lexus has to resort to such low handed sales tactics in order to make a sale. I can't imagine how they'll treat me once I'm their actual customer.

Each and every time they never fail to consistently treat customers rudely with horrible sales tactics.

One - they run credit even before they allow you to see or test drive a car.  No other Lexus Dealer (or Mercedes or Acura dealer) runs credit when you ask to see a car.
Secondly, they use delay tactics and hold your driver's license to keep you in the dealership waiting forever in their offices while ""they look for your license to return it to you.""
Finally, they use the hard-sell techniques of constantly sending in a higher ""manager"" to offer you a better deal three times over.

Why Lexus doesn't cut these guys out of the network is beyond me.  It's also stupid of me to have gone back over the years.  I should've learned the first time that they are run by a franchise owner with no understanding of customer service.

I'm sure Hyundai in 2011 will treat their customers better than Keyes Lexus.

so he said ""full detail"" and if it doesn't go away, he'll chnage the whole panel or  painted. or replaced. to a new car? come on. but anyhow, the deal was so attractive i couldn't pass on. 
so i gave my information and they ran my credit. i request to see the invoice. 
They gave me the deal we agreed on. however, they added LDA for ~$900. so basically the deal + LDA = actually worse than i got a quote from other dealer. i had to waste my whole weekend and drove 50 miles just to see this non-sense? so i asked, what's LDA? Fred told me he doesn't know. that doesn't make sense. he's assit manager. he should know what LDA means. and it's ~$900. he refused to explain it to me and he told me i didn't trust them. 

last time i saw other dealer's invoice, (Lexus of course) i did not recall LDA fee. if i saw one, i'd remember it. it's not just couple of dollars. it's ~$1000. we are talking invoice - couple hundreds of dollars and do you think i don't recognize that number? anyway, he refused to tell me what it was. so i walked away. later on, i found out that it's Lexus Dealer advertisement fee. what? I (not Lexus dealer) have to pay advertising fee??? hello. oh one more thing. their finace sucks too. before i went there, i did my homework. i got pre-approval from my bank. let say it came out x APR. their finance gave me x+3% APR. why so different? i understand that there will be some difference but not by 3%...

anyway, the worst dealer i ever experienced. if the sales person gives you great deal, ask if he or she is going to charge you for LDA. see what they tell you. ",1.5

I bought a new car IS250 Convertible from persistent sales manager Joey Yerkanyan. He is very friendly, nice guy and good service. They always offer me coffee, soda and friendly people working here. I have been in multiple times just browsing every time has been great. That staff does a great job with welcoming potential customers. Also Arthur was a very nice guy and knowledgeable. Thank you for all you have done so far. I will be sure to let friends know who to go to for a new Lexus",4.0
1294,"October 27, 2010","When I started shopping for a vehicle 4 months ago I had gone on line and went to Auto trader and compared many vehicles, they had a side by side comparison tool that let me look at BMW and Infinity along with Lexus. After using the comparison page to look I sent for a new car price from 3 dealers 2 will remain nameless as the called but never gave me the numbers I needed to shop, with the exception of ‚ÄúKeyes‚Äù. Not only did they send a quote with a few other choices but they offered me a lease payment also. 
Its been a few months now and once a month I get a call from Carol who always asks a great question. I like it so much I am going to repeat it.‚Äù If I could do one thing to move you forward today what would it be‚Äù? Well it‚Äôs a great question and it took till last week for the answer to come clear to me so I called her and told her.  She answered simply and said come on down I can pay off your car even though you have reverse equity we would be able to do that deal. 
So I set up an appointment and took my car to Carol. She made me sweat for about 35 minutes which seemed like 4hours however, when she came back I was told they had called around to other dealers trying to get more for my car and found a dealer that could sell it tomorrow. I know you wondering what the deal was aren‚Äôt you.  They got me out even cut me a sweet deal on the gas I wanted and I am overly happy to be driving my new car today. Its easier to make the payment when you love the car. Carol Ryan and Enamul thank you for your time and caring. You have won my business and everyone I can tell

After a few days I called & spoke to Oleg & he wanted me to come in & I gave him a day I could maybe be there.  Called ahead because I was driving 41 miles to see this car only because it was what I was looking for & would Oleg be there.  I was told Oleg had left but to come in & they would give him a call & he would come in. When I got there & asked for Oleg I was given the feeling he was there but they kept stalling by having Natashia show me the room with coffee & cookies.  After a waiting period, they said Oleg was out of town & couldn't make it in.  Then the pressure started.  I was dealing then with Edmund, & we could not agree on my trade-in, then the financing fee (only wanted to finance $5,000).  Then some other person gives the pressure on taking a extra warranty.  I will never go thru this again.  I didn't get out of there until midnight (they close at 9pm).  Next day I noticed the carpet on drivers side was very dirty.  I had other questions & when I e-mailed with my concerns, I received a general response that I would be contacted.  After about 10 days & no reply, I  sent a e-mail to the general manager R. Galllente asking my questions & would he please call me in the morning.  Now eight days later I have not been contacted.  I have received 4 e-mails of their great sales going on but that is it.

All downhill after I came to get the car.  40 minutes waiting for finance, no one offering to help me transfer stuff from one car to the other, no one to collect my old key at the end.  Sales guy was TOTALLY MIA at the end of the deal.  Car was still dirty upon delivery after waiting for it for 15 minutes after the paperwork was signed. It was a total WTF experience, unlike any Lexus experience that I've had.  Got 2 years free service as a promotion, so i hope the service part is better since I'm stuck with them.

After doing much investigation I took the car Dale in service. They discovered that the noise was coming from after market DVD that was put on the head-rest. Dale went ahead and fixed the problem by putting noise reduction pad. He also did some work axel, which was recommended and first owner never bothered to fix. The cost for all teh work were ZERO. And I got a great car wash. Every time I see a customer do not get the price they want to pay will make a big deal like the other two reviews that I just read. Now I have a question. The free cappuccino, Croissant,  Internet cafe... Are they really free? there is a price to luxury or you can go to JOE's Tire and pay $400, while you may not get the factory recommended service. If someone can't afford a good tire, may be think twice getting a luxury car. What is next? complain about Gas price and how GX470 gets less than 20 miles a gallon??

Then I took it to the regular tires shop, with alignment cost me less than $400... in conclusion they are a ripoff!

Today, just got a call from my friend, he went for a car wash. They damage his rim. They were trying to clean it, but still... it will cost $500 to fix. All they did was... send him home! (what kind of a service is this?)
