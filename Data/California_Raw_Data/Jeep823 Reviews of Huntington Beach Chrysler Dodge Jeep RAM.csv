Got very upset and hung up the phone. Finance department got an attitude with my phone and hung up on her. Don’t bring a trade in unless you want to get 1/3 of what your car is really worth.,1.0
1,"May 11, 2020","STAY AWAY!!! I wish I had read these reviews before wasting an entire day for these crooks to try and scam us. 

Drove 80 miles from San Diego to buy a car. When we got to financing they tried to add on a bunch of options including GPS, paint protection, and a COVID disinfectant spray. They lied saying that these options had already been installed so there was no way to remove them. The car we looked at they had just received and hadn't even been cleaned yet, there was no way any of this was already installed. 

I'm honestly so pissed we wasted so much time and effort to have them pull this xxxxxxxx. These guys are criminals and the textbook definition of why used car dealerships have such a bad reputation.",1.0
2,"May 08, 2020","Not willing to work with you and have products/packages that want to push unconditionally on top of the sale. 
I will be the first one to agree that its  understandable that we all have to make a living, but when the negotiations are based on deceitful and point blank insulting!?!?  Salesman said to me...  "" your cash is not good to me.    You have to finance ""  who the heck refuses a cash sale in order to get more money in interest!?!?! Specially in this economy!!! Aside from the BS products in their "" dealer packages ""  i found this one item very insulting.  So, I went back to the dealer I visited earlier and made the purchase.  when all was said and done.  I got the same deal than at HB jeep but with far less attempts to be taken advantage of.  
If you like to haggle and have your mental prowess challenged,  then this the place for you.  ",1.0
3,"May 05, 2020","Huge inventory so pricing is awesome. Sales Guy sucked though. Not courteous at all. Disrespected our time and money. No social distancing or masks or hand sanitizer. We came up from San Diego and knew we were making a purchase. So did our salesman, Oscar. Tried to rip us off. Had to bypass him to make the deal. ",4.0
4,"May 05, 2020","We were attracted to this dealer from the pricing, but what I learned in life was to deal online versus going in.  It saves everyone time and saliva from speaking and negotiating so much.  They won't deal with you via email because of ""high demands"".  More very old sales car tactics to bring you in.  Lets go back to that, high demands.  In this pandemic where many dealers are closed, lots are overfilled with unsold merchandise, and cars still on cargo ships where they are not unloaded because there's no room on any lots.  Sure looks like there is more inventory than demand.

Then they do the most irresponsible thing and maintain their old car sales tactics by bringing you in when we're in a pandemic and are in a shelter in place.  That is irresponsible on their behalf and comes to show they are more interested in profits than people's health.  I will not bring my wife and I to simply negotiate and possibly get sick.  We can do negotiations via email or telephone, then when we come to a price we both agree to, then we can come in and sign papers with minimal exposure.  Even my last two car purchases way before the pandemic allowed this (Lexus and Tesla).

I would avoid this dealer and if this is tactic is across the board, go to a different manufacturer that actually cares about people and willing to adapt and negotiate online or over the phone.  The car industry is hurting badly and they should be BEGGING us for business to move cars off their filled lots.  My wife and I were ready to drive away with a Jeep this week, but because of their demeanor, will try another dealer or manufacturer all together.",1.0

O boy did we get so disappointed , we sat down to run the numbers and BOOM we were at $25500 plus $520down🤣 we left that day 
We came back the neext day to talk about the price again and the added aftermarkets parts/ options ? because we were very interested 
They tried to tell us it had aftermarket dealer installed / vin etching bull$#@% for $4995  bringing the price back up 
We told them we dint want none of those 
And then told us that only 1 option can be removed , the others had to stay regarless so 2699 ontop of the 18400
We asked  them if they take out that extra option we would buy right now .
They told us that was not possible !!!

The prices advertised by this dealer are to good to be true .

11,"April 10, 2020","**UPDATE**
I hate to do this, but they (HB Chrysler Dodge Jeep RAM) got me. If it sounds too good to be true, with this dealership it probably is... I thought I wasn't getting scammed, but they just waited a week to start twisting everything around. 

First, was the chip in the windshield that they told me would get taken care of and replaced.  A month later, it still hasnt been taken care of.
Then I was given a copy of a clean Carfax, but I got home that night and noticed a basketball size dent in my bumper. I did not hit anything, and after telling the dealer about it, they reviewed their security footage and I was told they are ""not required to disclose damages unless they are a safety concern."" And that's not all...

A few weeks later, I was called back in for a better deal with a better bank and I need to come in to sign the papers or I'd lose my loan. I thought my current loan was decent, but better? Ok, I didn't think I was lied to yet, of course I'll come sign for a better deal. I get into financing and this time it's a paper contract (the first time it was all electronic and I was given a USB with all the files.) The finance manager has every paper stacked on top of one another covering the tops of the pages and only exposing the signature lines because ""the documents are all the same as before, only the finance company changed and we got you a better APR and monthly payment."" 

My original contract: 17.63% APR $368 monthly
My ""better deal"" contract: 22.89% APR $428.67 monthly

I purchased the truck for $11,500 and brought enough to pay off the truck that day. The finance manager told me if I want to build my credit get financing and just put money down. So I put $6,000 down in cash and was led to believe (all the way through driving off the lot) my financing was only for $5,500 +tax and license.  
 
I bought my first new truck from this place 20 years ago and I remember how comfortable and confident I was with all the decisions being made. It was the best vehicle purchase I ever made. When I went back to buy another truck last month, they gave me that feeling all over again. However, Huntington Beach Chrysler Dodge Jeep RAM aka Surf City Auto is not a dealership to be trusted. It's full of con-artists, cheats, and the epitome of used car salesmen.  

Original post: Let me start by saying this dealership has restored my faith in used car salesmen (at least the ones at Huntington Beach Chrysler Dodge Jeep RAM.) I was greeted by Victor, he was friendly and knowledgeable. I told him what I wanted, what I was spending and he found a truck better and still in my price range. Then I met Johnny and he was very straightforward, a ""no BS"" type of guy. There were no up sales, no ""bait and hook"", just a straight forward professionally ran business. I definitely recommend and will refer business to these guys anytime I can. A million thanks to Victor and Johnny and the guys at Huntington Beach Chrysler Dodge Jeep RAM!",1.0

13,"March 26, 2020","It started as a ugly experience where the price posted on the Internet was increased significantly with a number of unwanted additions. The salesman (Teo) handed me a brochure with four additional dealer installed items then handed me off to the sales manager who pressured me in to taking the deal or else. These included a list of useless and unwanted items (including a GPS tracking system) for thousands of dollars for all of them. I responded by threatening to not pay additional for the additions. When he said no I started to walk out the door. I got as far as the door when the sales manager decided it would be better to take my offer of the original Internet price than lose the sale.

Then after the negotiating and getting ready to sign the deal they let me know I had to finance the deal through their bank. I already had the cash and financing through my bank if I needed it-it didn't matter. The sales manager told me the deal was off unless I financed through their bank, I had no choice. I told him that I would pay off the loan before the first payment. He asked that I wait three months or they would not get their kickback from the bank.

The service was great. I got home and found that the sales person had not provided any training, did not go over the features and failed to provide an inspection before I left. The vehicle was missing the tool kit and one of the fenders had a number of scratches. I worked with the service department and they sent me the tool kit and new fender that I'll have a local dealer install.

Do not go to this dealer unless you are prepared to be firm and do not accept the unnecessary dealer add ons. Be firm, you may want to take an attorney with you to negotiate.",3.4

I said if they numbers do not work for what I am approved for I am not interested. They called up my credit union and requested an extension of a loan amount without even asking me and called me up saying “your approved when you gonna come get this car!?” They were absolutely unprofessional and rude. They had no authorization to go to my finance company and request an extension without my approval. Then when I got upset asking why would he think that’s ok, he hangs up on me.

16,"February 14, 2020","Worst and most bizarre experience ever. This dealer is absolutely practicing some of the worst deceptive sales methods around. After reviewing some of the posts here, it appears to be something that has become common over the last 6 months or so. I'm guessing there is new management in place but there is definitely some bad apples working there. Basically they've institutionalized a practice of luring you into the dealer with deceptively low advertised internet prices and then make up for the low price with add-on warranty packages or low ball trade in values. All dealers do this to some extent but this place seems to take pride in screwing the customer. When the sales manager realized he wasn't going to make the necessary margin on me he pulled the deal - and this is after we verbally agreed to an ""out the door"" price.  Avoid this place at all costs or make sure you don't fall for the tricks. I wasted about five hours of my life in this joke of a dealership and would never wish the same experience on anyone else.

22,"December 09, 2019","We came to buy a used Chevy Volt, despite reading many negative reviews.  I should've known better.  The car was great and the asking price was fair.  The sales guy said they are a no haggle dealership like Carmax.  Cool.  We pulled out the checkbook and were ready pay and take our new car home.  Easy.  Then we waited for two hours for the finance guy to bring the paperwork.  When he arrived, he looks at the computer screen and says he'll put together an estimated cost.  We curiously said ""ok?""  He then quoted $5,000 higher than their sticker price.  We very clearly said ""No!""  He asked what we want to pay, to which I replied ""If we are making up prices now, $9,000."" He then says, ""I can't charger more than our advertised price.""  So, I pulled out my phone and showed him the advertised price that we were willing to pay.  Then he said there were $4,000 worth of negotiable items already installed that they had to charge for.  We said we do not want to pay for what we do not need and he asks ""You don't expect people to do work and not pay for it? It's already installed.""

I spoke to the internet sales person, Bryan. I said I’m traveling from 2 hours away via rideshare if you can confirm that the price advertised is the price you will honor. I told him i don’t want any miscommunication or surprises if I’m going to travel all the way up there. But if the price is true, I’m ready to buy it. 

I told him I had financing through my bank already pre-approved. He said yes, that’s the guaranteed price. He acknowledged I have my own financing. 

I show up. He tries to make me sign a credit report per homeland security for OFAC. If you are not financing through the dealership, YOU DO NOT HAVE TO DO THIS. It’s a scam well documented amongst crediting agencies and websites like Edmunds.

He brings his manager over, they say it’s cool you don’t need to to do it. He makes some side comment about if my credit is low and if I’m worried. No, Bryan, I’m not worried, you simply don’t have authorization to check my credit.

He then tries to sell me on this $3900 buy up package with paint protection and security. He tells me it’s already on the vehicle so that’s all he can do.

I would have left if I had the option.
Basically they have this great text option that Henry would keep me updated on my car and respond quickly to my inquiries. It is great when they use it.
This experience had absolutely NO responses to my text messages. Attempts to call all went unanswered once transferred to my service tech. Messages both with operator and voicemail went unreturned.

34,"October 09, 2019","Get ready for a fight, or they will take you to the cleaners!

Found a 2018 Ram 2500 4x4 for a great price here while searching on the internet. I live about 6 hours away from Huntington Beach but this price was about $4k cheaper than everywhere else I could find this particular truck. I called the dealer, spoke with a Bryan and confirmed the price. I asked if there would be any surprise add-ons and he promised me that was the price I would get. I told him I was already approved for the loan and he said that was great!

My wife and I took the next day off, drove 6 hours, and got a hotel room so we could be at the dealer in the morning. This seemed like a good idea to save $4k. 

We went inside, asked for Bryan, he wasn't there but there was another nice kid who would be happy to help us. I told them I didn't want to cut Bryan out of his commission, they said no worries, he would still get it. 

We sat down with new kid. First thing he tells us is there will be an additional $4,000 for Theft Protection GPS, Surface Coating, and Service Contract. (All Optional in final contract, but I was told this is the only way I was getting that internet price.) Additionally, they insisted I used their financing even though I came in with a pre-approved loan. Their loan had an APR that was 3.4% higher than mine. They said I could refinance after 3 months. I said that would cost me three payments of nearly pure interest and they looked at me like I was crazy.

I said no way, I didn't ask for or want any of that crap. All I wanted was the price I was promised before I drove 6 hours and rented a hotel room. 

We fought all day. We left no less than three times. First time I left was because they didn't even have the truck there, I told them I didn't even want to talk to them anymore until they produced the truck so I could test drive it. We went to the beach and walked around with our feet in the ocean until they called us back and said they had the truck. 

After the test drive the fighting continued. All I wanted was the price I was promised and they told me I was being unreasonable. The manager said ""Okay, I can't earn everyone's business"", and walked away. We left, they ran us down in the parking lot and said they would come down by $1,750, but I still had to use their financing. I said no, they walked away. We drove off. 

We got about 5 minutes away and they called. This guy said he was the GM and he didn't want to loose my business because of financing. He said I could use my financing and take off a total of $2,300. We decided this is close enough and we took the deal. I know we could have nickle dimed them down some more, but it was getting late and we still had to drive 6 hours to get home. 

Now, this may be knit picking, but these guys got me on Yelp for the first time, so here we go...

After the the papers were signed, we waited a long time for the truck to be back from detailing. We were walking around the truck and my wife noticed a 2"" gash in the paint right on the edge of the front wheel well. I can't believe we didn't notice this before, and we had already signed. (Not really a deal breaker anyway.) I went inside and had the GM come out and look at the gash to see if there was anything they could do. ""Sorry man, AS-IS..."" and basically walked away. I thought, ""Really? Brand new car and I get AS-IS treatment?"" Still not a deal breaker, I can fix this anyways.

We were waiting some more, they couldn't find the rubber floor mats that were included or the spare key. They never found the mats, said they would be ordered and shipped. While waiting the same GM asked me to leave them a good review on Yelp and I said I would. I hope he didn't mean favorable, cause I would have said no.

This was an awful experience. This isn't my first time buying a vehicle, but I have never felt like I was dealing with such a crooked dealership. I left two stars because after a day of fighting and headache, we still got the truck cheaper than I could find it listed anywhere else in a 500 mile web search.

If you're up for a fight, got a day to burn, and don't mind walking out a few times to get what you were promised, then you might not mind buying a car here. Just don't travel a long distance and expect them to be upfront about pricing before you get there. All promises are out the window once you sit down with sales person.

I doubt I'll ever see those floor mats...

Steer clear! These guys are con artists. I have purchased many cars over the years. I called ahead of time about a specific car asked them for their bottom line OTD price, told them exactly when we'd be there, yet the car had to be chased down for 30 minutes. Test drive finished, we were ready to buy the car at the already agreed upon OTD price. xxxxxxx finance guy comes in and suddenly the price is up by over $4000, I told them, as I said before, we weren't interested in financing and wanted to get the paperwork signed for the previously agreed upon price. Finance guy says they can't do that, so we walk. Get a call a few minutes later, again promised if we come back we could have the car for the mutually agreed price. Now a new guy enters the picture and tells me he can sell it for the price listed on the internet, which is about $350 more than the agreed price even before they add all of the additional thousands of dollars of junk they try to force on you. we walked again, right into a reputable sellers store, and bought a the same exact car for less in a nicer color, including the extended warranty. We wasted way too much time at Huntington, getting passed on to several different ""managers"", I think three in all, not including the finance bloodsucker. Stay away if you care about your money and your sanity.",1.0
38,"September 27, 2019","worst place ever. Call the dealership because I saw a truck that they were advertising that I was interested in. Talked to one of the salesman on the phone, I ask him if he can email me a quote for that truck. I gave him my zip code so they can properly quote me. Then this guy replies that his dealership does not provide quotes. I was like WHAT????? What kind of dealership does not provide quotes? I have never heard that before. I told him if he can put it in writing that he can give me the advertised price on their website plus tax and license I would do the 2 hour drive from northern los angeles to Huntington beach. He keeps telling me I have to come down. I was not going to waste 2 hours of my life driving just to get there for them to bait and switch me. If they don't have anything to hide and that pricing is true, why couldn't they spend 5 minutes if that to write me a formal quote? I guess they did have something to hide if they repeatedly refuse to send me a quote. consumers please beware, this dealership advertises low prices to get people in the door but won't prove it in writing. I will be taking my business elsewhere.",1.0
39,"September 10, 2019","Too bad I had not read the reviews on this dealership well before wasting my time, gas & effort. Just reading the past 30 days of 1 star negative reviews sum up allot of how this illegitimate place works. Nothing but lies after lies well before you get into this dealership and then they continue when you arrive with the “Bait & Switch” tactics along with more lies. My opinion is that they need to be investigated & shut down for good.

I initially made contact with supposed salesman Androw Mansour on a RAM truck & was told the truck was available. I informed Androw that I lived in Hawaii & that I would be paying cash. He told me that they do not take cash or deposits on vehicles. He also said he worked in finance. I had been conversing with Androw for four days ensuring the truck was available & he confirmed it was. I called Androw on a Sunday & I asked him to please text me by the end of Monday night on the availability of the vehicle. I indicated to him that I would be flying all day & arriving late Monday night & would not be able to receive messages during my flight. I also made sure that he understood that I was driving to the dealership early Tuesday morning from San Diego to Huntington Beach.
   
Androw never contacted me on status and availability on Monday night as he said he would so I called him early morning Tuesday & he enthusiastically said “yes, the truck was still there”. So we started our 77 mile trip all the way to Huntington Beach. We were about 12 miles from the dealership when Androw called & said you’re not going to believe this and that the truck was just sold 10 minutes ago. He said however that there were 2 other trucks available, a Black & White one with the exact same features.

Not believing Androw, when I arrived at the dealership I immediately asked for the desk manager whose name is Jock. I inquired about the vehicle status that I came out to see & was told that it had been actually sold the day before. One of the other sales man Andy did a tracker on the truck and located it in Los Angeles. So I told Jock the desk manager that I had driven all the way from San Diego for this truck. Jock replied that they are the #1 sales dealership in the country & vehicles are continuously being sold. So I told him that this is what every dealership says which is a bunch of B.S. I also told him what he didn’t know and that was if the truck indeed had been sold the day before then why would your salesman Androw lie to me just over an hour ago & tell me that the truck was there. Jock’s reply was that he was going to have a talk with Androw.
 
When I asked Jock about the supposed Black & White trucks that Androw said were available, he then directed salesman Andy to look them up. Sure enough there were no trucks that Androw could produce however there were trucks at a higher price. So I asked Andy to get a hold of Androw & ask him where are these supposed trucks that he indicated on the phone that were available. Andy left & later came back & said he cannot find Androw. So I said to call him on his mobile & he said he didn’t have his number. I asked why is it that I have his number & the dealership doesn’t. He couldn’t provide me with an answer only to say that there are no trucks as Androw described however he again had higher priced trucks. I believe the kicker to this whole scheme is that Androw & Andy are one in the same person who is trying to cover up his own lies & mistakes.

So now it seems obvious that I too are another victim of being lured into this dealership by their false advertised pricing, con artist lies and illicit salesmen tactics all while at my own expense.
 
The good news however is that I did purchase a truck at Dave Smith Motors in Idaho. They literally are one of the highest volume dealerships in the nation with thousands of vehicles and availability to choose from. They don’t lie, are honest and pricing is unbeatable.

If there was an option for negative stars i'd put -5 and beyond. This dealership is filled with a bunch of classless employees starting with the person who answers phone calls to the sales reps and even more so, management! For 2 days i was trying to purchase a vehicle without even haggling the price of the vehicle. They would not send me a written quote, they insisted i come in. Once they found out i was going to purchase cash nobody wanted to talk to me i called every hour to try to talk to management, they were always ""busy"" and for 2 days i never received a call. I was told they do not take personal checks or cashiers checks by a sale rep and that i would have to finance through their bank and payoff loan after first month! I finally got through to another sales rep that said to just come down and within an hour and a half i was there. I walked in and they were slow i mean nobody there and it literally took 5 mins for someone to ask me if I've been helped! So much for the ""busy managers"" that couldn't return  my phone call! Anyhow, i told them the car i wanted to see and they said ""they sold it 40 minutes ago to a sister dealership""! Then i asked what dealership and that i'll go there to buy it. They replied ""they sold it to some family"". This place is a joke! If you have any experience buying cars and they cant sway you, you will be ignored and god forbid you want to buy cash and move a car that has been sitting on their lot for 100 days!  Usually they do all the calling if you enquirer about a vehicle but as soon as they saw cash coming, i was calling them and all i received was crickets from this dealership! I took off work drove in traffic for an hour lost time with my family just to get there and find out I've been lied to! THIS PLACE IS A JOKE! FOR YOUR OWN GOOD STAY AWAY! THERE ARE PLENTY OF CLASS ACT DEALERSHIPS OUT THERE AND THIS ONE IS NOT ONE OF THEM! THE CULTURE BEING TAUGHT THERE IS HORRENDOUS!!!!

45,"July 03, 2019","So this is for their Jeep dealership unit ( I have read about the other brand teams- Dodge, Ram- being equally notorious!!), - They had been advertising super low prices on their Jeep Wrangler models and refusing to engage much over the phone- They wanted us to be at the dealership to talk further! Understand this! So we went over to at their dealership. Even though we knew exactly which vehicle on their lot we wanted, they made us sit there for 6 hours!!- going back n forth on prices they had already advertised! Adding some weird unadvertised packages which made no sense at all to their final pricing! When we almost were ready to walk out, they called us back and removed that package amounting to almost 4000$. They sold off the vehicle which we test drove and agreed to purchase right under our nose to another customer!! How could you be so unprofessional in your dealings?
Finally- when the financing phase came, they didnt' realize that we had pre-approved ourselves on Chrysler financing and said that we will have to pay some high interest rate at something greater than 7% even though our credit scores were Tier A. When we brought it to their attention, they realized they couldn't swindle us on that front - so went ahead with the financing aspect. When they realizing we were not going to buy any additional extended care or maintenance packages from them, they got upset and started behaving rudely with my wife.- telling her that they know we are there because of the low prices they have advertised- Ofcourse that's why we were there- I mean isn't that the point of getting customers to your dealership! they were not favoring us in anyway!
 The only reason we purchased the vehicle from them was because, we didn't have time to shop around at other dealers and go thru the process all over again!- But if there was a police complaint i could make for false advertisements and unprofessional attitude,, I would do it right away!. Definitely thinking of filing a civil case against them for sure- so they get the message! Don't think anythings going to get fixed at their end though...",1.0

I told them I didnt want it and wouldn't pay for it. I told them that was not in the advertised price of the vehicle.

51,"June 01, 2019","6 HOURS to buy a car?   I called on Thursday the 23rd and made an appointment for the 24th at 9:30.   I told Ricardo which car I was interested in and he told me it was upfront. Victor was our salesman and he greeted us with kindness and enthusiasm and told me the car was in the back lot.  I was surprised to learn that the car I wanted was $2000 more than listed online. So George came in to explain it to us but instead we were met with arrogance and rudeness.  After a short but disturbing conversation/argument  he told us "" he's been doing this for 30 years and maybe we should leave and go think about it"".  At this point, my boyfriend left the desk to go ask for another manager and I told George I was no longer speaking to him. I have never been treated so badly.  George needs to realize that without me and every other customer.....he doesn't have a job.  Frankly I would of fired him if it were my company.

Now we're waiting for another manager, and Joe comes in and we have to start the process all over again after telling him how completely disgusted I am with the treatment I received from George. 3 hours after my appointment time, I finally get to see the car .....it is filthy.... dirt and debris everywhere.   It's so bad I don't even want to sit in it and there's no gas in it to take it for a test drive.   Also the rear passenger matching tire is not on and that needs to be replaced.   I'm told it will take an hour to change the tire and to clean and detail the car.   This is how they present a car to someone who wants to buy it??

An hour goes by... just 30 more minutes, 15 more minutes.... lie after lie. 2 1/2 hours later my car is ""ready"".   But I look in the car, it's still not completely clean and there's no gas in it.   Joe explained to me that the cleaning is subcontracted out, and they have no control over how long it takes for them to do their job. Really? This is the standard that is acceptable and you make excuses for them??

I arrived at 9:30 ready to buy a car..... that car and it is now 3:30.   The level of BS that was handed to me that day was ridiculous and insulting?   I love a jeep but I will never step foot back into that dealership again other than the required yearly visit through my warranty... and believe me I'm telling everyone and anyone.   And here's a suggestion stop eating at the front desk. Nobody wants to come in to buy a car and see you with a mouthful of food.  

Finally driving home I notice he Stop/Start is not working so I called and talked to Dan.  Who told me that it really doesn't save gas and is really hard on the engine, so I shouldn't worry about fixing it.  REALLY??  I buy a car that has 360 miles on it....EVERYTHING should work on it.  But after all his daughter has a Compass and hers is turned off and I should do the same.....  

The above is a sugar coated version..... it was a miserable day and experience.......it pains me to the know that I am part of their salary earned that day.  Buying a car should not be that miserable .....it shouldn't be miserable at all.......  and yes I could of walked away but I've had two Jeeps before and believe in the car.

They add in their $4k dealer accessories kit which is smoke and mirrors, and tell you that you must finance the vehicle through the dealership for atleast 3 months at 7% APR, then you can refinance with any lender. As someone with very good credit, I've never seen modern cars selling with 7% APR. I managed to shave $2K off their dealer accessories and took out the other xxxxxxxx warranties they tried baiting in as well, so for those that say its non negotiable, it is but they wont take it all off.

I walked, too much smoke and mirrors, hidden fees, etc. I will be buying a wrangler but certainly not from them.

64,"January 24, 2019","When you go to a dealership and buy a car new from the lot, you're not just buying a car but you're buying a piece of mine that anything that breaks on it is covered for the next 36,000 miles. You're not expecting them to all of a sudden after a year-and-a-half turn on you and try to rip you off looking for any reason they can. My radio broke a year ago and I took it out oh, this does not void the warranty, even though he's trying to convince me it does and trying to convince me that my air conditioner knob won't turn because I took my radio out of year ago. Not only that, I've been bringing my vehicle to this place for the past year since I got it and the last two times I brought it it didn't have the radio in it and because I didn't get this bearded self proclaimed mechanic as a service provider... it was never a problem and all the issues that were covered under warranty we're fixed. I wasn't asking for the radio to be fixed. This time it was my door latches and my air conditioner knob would not physically turn and he's going to try to tell me that that's because I took my radio out a year ago and it's so ridiculously underhanded and is blatantly transparent they are not out for customer service or do you good because you bought a vehicle from them...they are out to suck as much money out from you as they possibly can even as a loyal customer. I don't understand it because these guys, at the front desk, if they're not getting the money you've figured they would understand and it would try that help you get your car fixed...not try to say $150 to bring it in when it's under warranty. Yes you heard me $150 to bring it in and it still under warranty it's only a year-and-a-half old. I did not install any more systems I did not alter anything electrical inside I simply took the radio out of the dash. They wouldn't even compromised to fix my back door latches on my patch on the back because you know that's directly related to the radio(sarcastic) and makes a whole bunch of sense there. I really wish he wouldn't have been so stubborn with this, it's just not right, taking the radio off does not effect the door latches nor the A/C components and DOES NOT void your warranty... and he kept thinking if he explained it enough  to me that I was going to believe what he said. So basically they are trying to rip me off and weasel their way out of a signed contract warranty...when there's been multiple repairs on this thing...in the same condition as it's in now...so there's nothing really more I can say to get the point across. The Dodge I had bought had broken multiple times within the first year and they had it for upwards of two weeks at a time, 2 weeks and I didn't say nothing I didn't complain at all because they had me covered and they fixed everything that was wrong with it... everything that was DESERVED to be fixed. Now for a couple little things it would have taken maybe an hour and a half to do all of them, they're going to cause me and themselves this much trouble trying to squeeze a hundred something bucks out of me which...I got...but it's not the point. The fact that they serviced before in the same condition and now they're not lets you know that the inconsistency automatically leads to the conclusion that they're ripping us off every chance they can get...any time they can think of. I know this is common knowledge, that dealers rip you off....but I'm not having it this time....you should have just fixed my doors and A/C....I talked to my lawyer friend...my warranty is still valid....stop jerking people around. I'm about too move forward with being a real pain in the xxx for you HB dodge...you maybe enough of of people in HB...stop greed before I start a campaign. ;)",1.0

66,"January 05, 2019","Went to the dealer after they would not negotiate an out the door price over the internet or phone.  Turns out the Ram truck that was advertised was just a ploy to get customers into their door.  The truck is a Ram 2019 Longhorn with a stock number 50505 was advertised as an MSRP of 58K when the actual vehicle was 62K, they then proceeded to tell me that I had to buy 4500 dollars in additional dealer services to get the vehicle at the advertised price.  Makes sense since the garbage they sell as ""extra coverage"" is 100% pure profit and the sale of the truck is a just s small fraction into their pocket. 

The sad part of this story is my wife is 8 months pregnant and we spent 4 hours there just to be taken advantage of.  I even bought a vehicle here in 2014 and got the vehicle and at the advertised price.  Not sure if what they are doing is legal but its sad to see places like this are still in business.  Even contacted Ram which didn't have much to say.  

Really love the looks of these new trucks but I cant see a reason why I would want to give my business to people like this.  Would rather pay more for something less to an honest dealership that cares about customer service.

70,"December 16, 2018","Our salesperson Kenny was professional and non-pressuring throughout the the buying experience. 

Before going in I had heard a few stories, mainly from the competition;
1) The advertised pricing is a bait and switch. 
2) The customer service is terrible. 

Although far from perfect, I feel doing my homework before buying a car is a strong suit of mine.

The deal they were offering on the Cherokee Trailhawk was great, like 10k off sticker.

Funny thing, three other dealers told me there is no way HBD could sell it for that price.

I started with a call, Kenny was very helpful and confirmed they had the car. We set a time to come down ro do the deal.

My only issue was before we even started. Kenny told us the car would be on the lot cleaned and ready to go, it wasn't........

While gradding lunch, my wife and I got the call it was ready for a tezt drive. Now I don't test drive (slow my process down), but the car is for my wife and she wanted to kick the tires.

Anyway, my take on th HBD, they are a no haggle dealer, they sell cars at discounted pricing and the feel of the place is no frills IE; don't expect a free tank of gas. They have a sign that says they fill only 3 gallons in the tank to help keep cost down.

Where some shoppers might get confused thinking all dealers can deal off their lowest price, even when HBD is lower than most of the competition in the area, they may feel a better deal can be made, in the end do the homework before going in and as we did it could turn out to be a great buying experience also.

I called yesterday, 10/23, and made a 7:00 appt. for today 10/24. When I spoke to Henry Jimenez (service advisor) we discussed (and confirmed) fixing 4 issues; replace 2 front tires, fix the recall, door paneling falling off, and I needed a new key fob. Henry then told me that they would only need my car for a day because these were all very ""simple"". 
    My car was dropped off at the dealership at 7:05 am. Henry called me at 3:00pm (8 hours later) with a nasty attitude, and said ""I don't know why you had your car towed up here, we started it just fine"". I then reiterated the issues that needed fixing, and Henry said ""oh yeah"", and hung up. I then called back at 5:49 and asked Henry when my car would be ready, and he said I couldn't pick it up until tomorrow. I told him that it was crucial I get my car back, because I was taking my godmother to chemo in the morning & I had school. Henry very nastily replied ""yeah, well"". Then Henry lied and said ""We didn't have the tires in stock"". When I told him that wasn't true because I confirmed that there were 5 tires in stock before I made the appt. he again nastily replied ""yeah, well"". I then said ""If you had any issues you should have just called me"". Henry again ""yeah, well"". I asked him why he didn't call me; he gave no response. I then said ""New tires are simple and quick, you still have time to do it today."" Again Henry nastily replied, ""yeah, well - no I don't"". He then text messaged me at 6:02, and said I could get my car (with no new tires of course) which was the sole reason for dropping it off. Obviously I can't drive with no tread (that's why the car was towed).",1.2

Don’t bother getting a pre approved loan from a major lender they will not accept. Ie. USAA pre approved loans
Felt as if I was inconvenience to them for wanting to purchase a car. Plan on spending hours waiting on finance even if you are 1 of 2 people waiting.  While you are waiting you would think they would be prepping your car for delivery to you , however that is not the case. So after waiting hours on finance, plan to spend at least another hour waiting on them to take another hour to wash your car.

I had to call back the next day to learn that they tried to hide a FOUR THOUSAND DOLLAR extended warranty in those numbers, hoping that I wouldn't do the math.  We never once discussed an extended warranty, I never asked for it, and they never disclosed that they were adding it to the total amount financed.

If you absolutely must buy a car from this place, make 100% sure you know what the price of the car is...and what else you're paying for.  If your salesman keeps going to the finance guy and returning with only down payment and monthly payments, talk to the finance guy directly and see what the total amount financed is and an itemized list of things that contribute to that number.

89,"July 24, 2018","UPDATE: Problem resolved. The day after I posted this review, I received a text from one of the managers, David Nehrir, who apologized for the bad experience I'd had. Furthermore, they mailed a check refunding the fraudulent charges. 

INITIAL POST: The finance staff Leo (I don’t know his last name) and Cisco Mejia fraudulently charged me $628. I explicitly stated that I did not want to buy any optional goods or services. Leo said that the Nitrofill and Etch theft deterrent device were included on all vehicles and that there was no additional charge. That was a lie. I also explicitly stated that I did not want the vehicle contract cancellation, and they charged me for that. 

I have called and left voicemails repeatedly and have never received a call back. I have exchanged 7 emails with the finance staff, but they have not communicated anything with me regarding the fraudulent charges.  

All of their paperwork was on a screen. On each screen, Leo told me what I was signing and then scrolled down to the bottom where I would sign. I was not able to see that he was checking boxes that were the exact opposite of what I had said. They put all the paperwork on a flash drive but did not give me the flash drive when I left. I was not given any paperwork, contracts, or receipts except for a receipt that just listed the $2,500 down payment I gave at the time of purchase. I purchased the car on Sunday, June 10, 2018. Since it was Sunday evening, my bank was closed. When I came back to Huntington Beach (I live in San Diego) on June 14 to pay the balance on my car, I asked for a receipt, and that’s when I saw the extra $628 of charges. I met with Alex Sandoval who said his manager would need to talk to his manager before the charges could be reversed. It has now been over 6 weeks of me calling and emailing them and hearing nothing back. 

The Etch that Leo said was free was $199. The Nitrofill that he said was free was $179. The vehicle contract cancellation option that I said I did not want was $250. 

On their website, their core values include truthfulness, responsiveness, and consistency. I have experienced the exact opposite of these. The finance department has been deceitful, dishonest, unresponsive, and unreliable. These fraudulent charges and the process of trying to get my $628 back have caused a great deal of emotional and mental stress as well as financial hardship. The good experience I had with their salesman T. Wayne and their competitive pricing has been completely erased by their finance team’s deceitfulness. ",1.0

97,"May 30, 2018","There's a reason most people dread going to a car dealership. Imagine you negotiate a deal, come to an agreement, and then afterward the seller changes the deal and tries to charge you more. That's the system in place at this dealership.

I worked with a salesperson named Manny Avendano, who was pretty easy to work with, and we negotiated a fair deal to purchase a used car and for a trade-in.

When we moved to the finance office and talked with Don Vuong, that's when things went south. There were $509 in total fees added to the purchase contract that were completely ridiculous. 

1. $250 'insurance fee' that gives the right to return the car within 48 hours for a refund. This is ridiculous. There's no way this is a real insurance program that is underwritten by an independent third party; this is simply the dealership adding pure profit to the deal on the back end, and changing the terms of the purchase price through a deceptive add-on. Don insisted that this is a required part of the purchase contract, standard on all deals this dealership makes, and could not be removed.

2.  $179 NitroFill 5 year subscription. This is a standard add-on also, which pays for nitrogen in your tires and 5 years of roadside assistance. Of course, there's no good way to evaluate whether this program is any good while you're sitting there in the finance office, but between my auto insurance and a AAA membership, this is completely unnecessary. It was a xxxx of a fight and probably a half hour of arguing, but i did get this removed from the purchase contract. At first, Don insisted that this is standard requirement and could not be removed, but in the end he was easily able to delete it from the contract in two seconds.

3. $80 document processing fee. Every dealership charges a doc fee, and it's usually around this cost range. It's a BS fee that I've never had successfully removed from a purchase contract. But there it is, now you know how much this dealership charges. Keep in mind that all the docs are processed electronically. What is this $80 for? Software subscription? Am i paying for the labor hours for the finance manager? This is paying for dealership overhead, not my problem, bake it into the car's price.

And the people they hire there to sell us cars are just that know-nothing guys. But I guess that is how much respect HB Jeep has for its consumers. I really wish these guys got more training other than how to log into their dealer website and more Customer Service training but from what i saw the lady conducting part of the training was more concerned with letting the new herd of dumb flesh know how much more dedicated she is to the company than anything else. Maybe instead of continuing to hire herd after herd they should spend the money and commission theyre giving to these guy on some real training for how to treat a customer and most of all on a legal team or someone with some understanding of how advertising works. I guess nobody really cares of or has heard that false advertising is a crime. And maybe theyre just that disconnected and dont think that a knowledgeable and apologetic rep would mean the difference between a frustrated understanding customer and a pissed off misled consumer filing a claim for false advertising.

Also, this dealer loves to DAMAGE your new car by drilling holes in the front bumper for the license plate. Usually it's crooked (three cars I have purchased here) and they use rough sheet metal screws that make the PAINTED bumper/fascia pucker and deform. Who thinks this is smart at this dealer?",4.2

However, I soon find out that the old body shop manager I had been in Correspondence with left the company. So I assume the new body shop manager will probably come and talk to me instead. Nope, my new guy they had hired Steve, just blows me off when I try to introduce myself and shake his hand. Yet, the guy is too busy to even acknowledge my existence.  Then I look at my car and one side is darker in color than the other. They suggest to just ""buff it out"" and once it's in the sun the new paint will fade down to the old. So they're asking me to buff out the paint job they just did? I'm wondering why they're asking me to do their job after $8000 in repairs. In addition, I get in my car and drive home with a better indignation only to find out that my pants are soaked in oil from the seat. Apparently one of the mechanics leaked oil in my front driver seat, resulting in a new pair of pants ruined.

I took my vehicle over the holidays due to engine light going on, was told it was due to open thermostat which was not covered by warranty or extended warranty. When I asked why It was not covered under Federal Emissions warranty, the service provider simply stated it was not listed on computer and therefor not covered. Furthermore, he could not see how this would be an emission issue.  Their initial price for replacement and thermostat and flush was over $500.00. When I complained about their lack of adequate response for not being covered, no effort was made to provide me with proper response.  Furthermore, if I didn't have work done there, I would still be charged 150.00 dollars just for read the code.  They also suggested I get work done which had already been performed, i.e. tires.  When I informed them that I had recently purchased new tires, the response was ""well this is just stuff the computer prints outs as suggestions because of the miles""",1.4
107,"January 03, 2018","First of all I had a bad experience with this dealership!! When I purchased my vehicle back in May 26,2017 I told them that the car didn't have gas and that they needed to put gas in it. When I told them too they said that they didn't do that there. I was furious because I drove all the way from Riverside to Huntington to get a Jeep. Therefore I had to put my own gas. My first purchased vehicle at a different dealership made sure to put a full tank. Even at the dealership where my boyfriend bought his RAM truck at BMW of Murrieta put a full tank of gas and it was a used vehicle too. I was so disappointed after that. Back in November 2017 when I had my first car service I went in for a regular oil change and maintenance check. When I get there to check in the representative tells me that my car had a recall and I'm thinking like 'DID THEY SELL ME A CAR THAT HAS A RECALL AND THEY ALREADY KNEW ABOUT IT!?' I kept asking the representative what kind of recall and he said it was a sticker from the VIN number that I was going to receive a letter in the mail. Till this day I have not received any letter! The recall is supposedly called a T12? I tried using google to see what a T12 recall meant and nothing came up. I even went on the website where you search up vehicles with recalls and my car did not show up at all. I was so confused at that point. I don't know what kind of dealership this is and what kind of service they hold but my car service was not completed. All the checkups that they supposedly did they obviously did not complete the job. I got a description of all the services they made and they checked off that they checked all the fluids in the vehicle. Lies! I dropped off the car with low washer fluid and I never refilled it because I knew I was getting the service and they were going to refill it. I get the car back and it still had low washer fluid. I know what to expect when it comes down to car services because Valvoline would walk me through it, even Valvoline has better service then this dealer! I tried to complain about it and they said that they forgot to reset it. I had my boyfriend check and they didn't refill anything!

After doing my research online, I walked in knowing exactly which stock numbers I was interested in. After meeting a salesman and relaying the trucks I wanted to see, it took 90 minutes just to get the vehicle from their offsite warehouse to the dealership. When it arrived I looked at it, then went back in to get the keys from my salesman, only to be told that it was already sold. Huge bummer, but I'm determined. My salesman recommended I go grab lunch and he would call me when my next choice was ready to view. After TWO HOURS and no phone call, I call him and he tells me it's ready but he forgot to call me. I return to the dealership and sit down to make a deal. My salesman was doing at least three other things and got up several times. He also was less than informed and had to ask his manager for the answer to every question I asked. I didn't appreciate being charged an additional $900 than the advertised price because I had already secured my own financing. They also refused to honor a Ram $500 military discount for which I qualified. The manager had an opportunity to smooth things over and step in to save his struggling salesman, but instead was rude and unapologetic.

We have to ship the car to NC and need the registration papers and it is the end of April. We called again today and received the same answer. Really frustrated with the horrible service we received. I had to take half leave and drive to the office and also left a message on Pete's voicemail. After showing my frustration clearly, Candy ( DMV person) finally found the old owner's papers and promised me to do all paperwork by 2nd May and asked me to come and pick up the papers?

160,"March 14, 2017","So let me start this review by suggesting that I have purchased a multitude of cars from various dealerships and manufacturers ranging from inexpensive to very expensive! Never have I ever encountered a more unprofessional, disorganized and wasteful entity in my entire life! I essentially spoon fed them a sale! I called early in the morning and spoke to Oscar (this gentlemen is the internet manager and judging by my experience with him, it's really no surprise that the organization is as horrendous as it is). I told Oscar what car I wanted to test drive, when I would be there and reiterated the importance of timeliness as I made a 2 hour commute to get to the facility. I had also prequalified for a loan and secured financing prior to my arrival. In addition I got my trade appraised, through their website, and had my pink slip in hand ready to make my purchase! When I arrived, on time might I add, I had to wait nearly 30 minutes for my sales rep to acknowledge my presence. Afterwards he took me to the vehicle I was going to purchase. It was unkept and filthy! All of this was of little consequence as the vehicle was being sold at a great price and the inherent value was present. As I went to test drive the vehicle Oscar realized that the dealership had lost the key to the vehicle. They initially thought they locked it inside and I had to help them POP THE LOCK! (As far fetched as this sounds I'm not making it up.) we spent nearly an hour popping the lock to find the key wasn't in the car! It took nearly two hours to get a locksmith to make a new key! Again I waited through this process kindly and patiently! Durning which time I waited in a dilapidated showroom that was clearly not being maintained from an aesthetic or functional perspective with one of the most unprofessional managers I've ever experienced. Yet still I waited trying to give the dealership the benefit of the doubt! As my visit approached the three hour mark I finally test drove the vehicle and came to agreeable financial terms. One would think that after the courtesy and patience I demonstrated the duration of my experience would be seamless...however you would be wrong! Another two hours past as I sat aimlessly waiting for this inefficient, disorganized, and unprofessional people to get together the paperwork for my purchase. They could not manage to do so. I arrived at the dealership at 6 pm and at 11:15 pm I decided that I would take my business elsewhere! When I told them to cancel the transaction I did not receive so much as an apology! Very frustrating experience! It is no wonder that this dealership and the entire Chrysler, Jeep, Dodge brand is going under! DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME HERE!",1.8

171,"February 09, 2017","The problem started when I first leased the car in November 2016, the advertised price was 24, 000 $, after we agreed on the terms and everything, we signed the contract, and the Finance manager, David Gold, told me that there is no need to read the contract, just sign it. After I went home, I read the contract and the Purchase price was 34,000$, not 24K. I went back and tried to resolve the issue and cancel the contract, they said they are ""Sorry"" about this mistake, but they can't cancel it because the car have already been sold. The next problem happened last monday. I received a call from the dealership. The person told me that I owed them money. I made all of my payments on time and have paper proof. They said that If I am not going to pay, I have to come over to the dealership to talk. Today, I drove 2 hours to get to the dealership, spent 4 hours there and drove another 3 hours back due to traffic. And the problem was not resolved. They had me drive all the way to give them a couple of papers where I could have just emailed them back. I then tried to trade in the car I bought for another one, but the new manager told me that I cannot do that, because I agreed to pay so much on the first car that I will have to lose so much money If I want to trade it in.

185,"December 17, 2016"," Been thinking about new Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT Night for 6 months now. Finally a friend said ""you only live once"", and that did it for me. Decided to pull the trigger and buy one. Found the velvet red we wanted on the internet at Huntington Beach Jeep. I have contacts at another Jeep dealership and contacted them first, told them about the Jeep at HB Jeep. I was then told that that Jeep had been sold and was not available. I was bummed. I called HB Jeep and enquired about the Jeep and found out it was still available and was never sold! Wow! I was pissed that they lied to me. So we made an appoitment to look at it and drove down there. We were met by Mitchell Louie, a very nice young man. First thing we did was go for a road test. The sound of the exhaust was so nice, deep throaty American muscle V8. He had us drive it a few miles, down some long, open streets were we could open it up. Yes!!!! I fell in love with the power right away and it reminded me of our first Hemi, a 2005 Magnum (still have that one, its a show car now). Back at the dealership we took at close inspection of the exterior. The wife found numerous scratches and it was not real clean. I knew they would buff out but when your gonna drop 75k you want perfection. So they took the car to the back and had the detailer do his thing. Meanwhile we sat down and started to hammer out the deal. The car was priced way below sticker and I felt very good about the deal we got. Mitchell was the best, he was first of all very polite, friendly and extremely knowledgeable about the car. He listened to everything we had to say and how we wanted the deal to go down. He made sure everything was in order. Meanwhile the car was done at the detailer and ready for inspection. The wife took another close look at she said ok! It passed inspection, although there now was lots of polishing compound all over which they very quickly assured me it would be cleaned up real nice if we decided to go for it. So it was go! We were very excited, a new road trip car that we could now drive down roads that the Magnum was not suited for! So very excited. 
That took us to the dreaded financial room. We were greeted by Jose Rodriguez. Immediatly we felt comfortable. He was very nice and reassured us we would be done shortly. They have the coolest desks! The top is a computer tablet touchscreen the size of the desk! All the paper work comes up on the desk, huge and easy to read, we signed the documents right on the desktop, was very high tech and easy! Jose was the best, listened to us and did not try to up sell us at all. Kudos to Jose. 
So our experience at HB Jeep was great. From Sam, the first man I spoke with on the phone, to Mitchell who took such great care of us and really cared about us, to Jose who made the financial part so easy, we would like to send you all a huge thank you! All the people at the dealership were very friendly and nice, if even just to say hello. We would recommend Mitchell and the people at HB Jeep to anyone interested in a new Mopar. By the way they have at least 15 Hellcats there, almost jumped on one instead of the Jeep!",5.0

Within 10 minutes of arrival, I noticed that the MSRP on the vehicle’s window sticker was significantly LOWER than what they said in them adds; making their discount less than advertised.  I pointed this out to the salesman, who said – “I’ve never seen this happen before.  My apologies.  I’m sure my manager will honor the error.”  I mentioned that maybe the other vehicle was correct; sad to say, it too had the same deceptive error.  What are the odds!  If you’ve ever bought from them, you were probably quietly screwed too.
1 ½ hours later, after having most all the work completed to purchase the vehicle; the manager admitted the error; but, said that “in small print, it says if a mistake is made, we don’t honor them”.
I’m an employer, if my employee makes an error – I will do my best to honor it and serve the client.  They admitted the error but was unwilling to make even a ONE-dollar adjustment towards the $1,000 error.
Thus, they went from being a vendor I would recommend to a deceptive, dishonorable dealer.  I would suggest that you avoid them.  HONOR DOESN’T MATTER IN POLITICS; but, it should matter in business!

214,"October 16, 2016","EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED in how this dealership handled customer service.
After TWO WEEKS, our brand new Jeep that we bought at this dealership would not start. This was disappointing in itself, but my review is based on how inadequate the situation was handled. 

When the car did not start on a Saturday night, I tried to contact the dealership but found that not many people were there, which was understandable. I left a message with Tom Cruz, the sales manager, and I left two messages with Jacob Jacobo, the man that helped us buy the car. I also left a general voicemail with the receptionist that night for ANYONE to get back to me. 

I received no calls back the next day, so I left a separate message with each of the men above another message with a different sales manager, and another message with the receptionist again for anyone to get back to me. I had to have the car towed TWICE from one dealership that was the closest to me, then to Huntington Beach. This was covered under warranty, but essentially our day was gone while we waited four hours to get the car to the dealer. 

My husband and I work in San Diego, and we needed to get into a rental or something to get back and thankfully, the service department helped us with that, which is why this review is in my opinion worth one star (even if there is no option for zero stars). Although our car was not in the dealership's possession, they put us into a rental, but this would bite us in the butt later since we didn't get paperwork for the mileage coming in.

We still did not receive any correspondence back, after FOUR days, and after leaving voicemails every day with the receptionist, it was finally ridiculous and I sent an email to Tom and Jacob. Then Tom emailed me back right then and there and told me that him, and his whole team were out, and this was why no one had contacted us. I find that extremely hard to believe because the day before the receptionist let me know that Jacob had been in, but left early. After telling Tom this via email, I hadn't heard back from him, and still haven't. 

My Jeep was ready after almost two weeks of being in the service department, and while I appreciated that our car was worked on, when we got our car back there was almost 200 extra miles on the car. Now we did not have the paperwork as I mentioned with our situation of the car not being in when we received the rental. But the service department gave us the invoice letting us know the car came in at 1420 miles, which it did not, had been driven 5 miles to check if it worked, and it says that we received the car back with 1426 miles on it. However, we have pictures that our car came out at 1423 miles. Something wasn't right, and this whole situation was just wrong in the first place. 

I would caution everyone about coming here. It was not only disappointing, but just upsetting and a huge hassle that no one should have to deal with when buying a new car.",2.8

236,"September 21, 2016","This is regarding my experience with Dodge Huntington Beach... I was sold a certified pre-owned Dodge Challenger RT. The sales process was smooth, I don't really have any complaints about that. However, being a first time buyer, I was unaware that the dealership is required to give you a copy of the supposed 125 point inspection. Within 3 months of purchasing the vehicle, while driving down the freeway with my wife, we heard a loud 'clunk"" sound. That was the left radius arm coming out (think of it as a ball and socket joint) I got the vehicle home and had it towed to the dealership. While at the dealership, the service tech told me they would not likely get to my car that day and offered a loaner car, I accepted his offer. I get a call from the service tech the following day, demanding I return the loaner car. He proceeded to tell me over the phone that the type of damage was not covered and therfore, I was not approved to have it. Then he explained that the radius arm was damaged and/or broken and all 4 tires were bald. Also, there were missing nuts and bolts. I asked what could ha e caused this type of damage? He could not give me a definitive cause, he resorted to mere speculation. That it must be due to negligent driving. I have a 6 year old daughter that wants to go with me everywhere. To the fathers out there, you know what I'm talking about. There is no way in xxxx, that I would risk my daughters life, driving in such a manner. I reviewed the Carfax that was given to me, the previous owner was in a minor accident to the front, no further details. This was not disclosed to me at the time of purchase, which is my fault, I'm told the dealer is not required to reveal that to me. However, for the sales rep. to tell me that is has not been in any accidents, that's a different story. The Carfax report also shows the previous owner had all 4 tires replaced, then oddly enough, he had all 4 replaced only after putting less than 4,000 miles on the new pair. This is a 5 year old car, but it only had 16,xxx miles on it. Why would he replace the tires only after 4,000 miles on the new pair? Why did my tires go bald only after putting 9,000 miles on them before I had it towed to the dealership? I researched it and a suspension issue would cause early wear on the tires. What was affecting the vehicle when the original owner had it,  is clearly affecting my vehicle still. I pointed out all of this to the service tech. I purchased an extended warranty contract from them at the time of purchase. I contacted them, they told me to have the dealership call, to start the process. I asked the service tech to call, I waited 3 days, still nothing from the extended warranty company. I called the service tech to see if he had called. He said he hadn't, cuz he said he knew they wouldn't cover it. Well, I didn't know he had the right to make that decision. He agreed to call but it sounded like it bothered him to do so. They were no help at all. Finally, I get a car from Patrick, the rep. who the extended warranty company sent out. The dealership did not even make me aware that he came out to inspect the vehicle. Patrick told me that they could not cover the repairs due to they don't cover missing parts. He further explained to me, the missing nuts and bolts mentioned earlier, did not appear to be sheared off. Indicating, that someone forgot to put them on or did not put them on correctly. Patrick told me to ask the dealer how did this get missed on the certified pre-owned inspection? I pointed this out to the service tech and to the manager. I did not hear one response from them. While Patrick and I reviewed the Carfax so I could point out the original owner replacing the tires after only putting 4,000 miles on his new pair. His copy of the Carfax did not show this on the history. His copy just showed they were balanced. How does this type of pertinent information, that would be favorable for the dealership be taken out of the Carfax history? Now, the service tech changed it from we don't cover the type of damage, to my vehicle was out of the warranty period. My argument is that the problem existed before the time of purchase. All the things I pointed out clearly show that. The dealership has given me speculation with no definitive cause. They still would not cover the repairs. They still haven't. Mind you, what I mentioned wasn't a fast process. This is about 4 months after I brought in my vehicle. I'm paying for a car, I haven't been able to use. It was only out of the warranty period,  less than a month. You would think they would cover the repairs for a disabled Iraq veteran, after I pointed all of this out. I explained to them that I was a disabled veteran and I deserved better treatment from them, instead of being ignored for months. They didn't acknowledge this at all.",1.4

250,"September 01, 2016","DERRICK IN SERVICE TRIED TO SCAM ME FOR $800

I brought my vehicle into HB for Transmission service 5 days ago . 
the day after the service I noticed my vehicle was leaking fluid. (it has never leaked before) 
I called made and appointment with derrick yesterday . today he acted like I never called or spoke with him . 
  Derrick diagnosed my leak  as "" the gasket around the oil pan is leaking."" he said there was dirt caked around the oil pan on the edges holding in the oil . some of the dirt shook loose and now its leaking . he quoted me $ 800 . I told him that diagnosis does not sound accurate. I drive on the freeway . I don't drive through dirt for it to get caked up . I took my keys and went inside to talk to the General manager.   I waited for 10 minutes. Derrick came to me and said he wanted to put my car in the air and show me the dirt .. I said ok .. he took my car back and I am waiting for 20 minutes while its in the air.. finally I go back to see what is going on .. I then see derrick and the mechanic looking all under my car with flashlights and talking about where the leak could be coming from.. 

derrick comes back to me and says. 
"" well maybe the leak is coming from the top"" let me lower it and look. they lower it and look. 

then derrick says well maybe the leak is this.... we need to take some stuff apart to find out what is going on .. 

then derrick has the nerve to say I am looking at him like he does not know what he is talking about  . and he has been in the business 25 years and this is what he needs to do to diagnose my vehicle. 

I told him he is right I am looking at him like he does not know what he is talking about 

45 minutes ago he diagnosed my vehicle and quoted me 800 for repairs.. 

when I wanted to talk to management HE came back to ME and said he would SHOW ME the dirt caked up ect.... but once the car was in the air . he COULD NOT SHOW ME THE AFFORE MENTIONED DIRT WHICH HAD CAKED UP AND WHICH WOULD COST 800$ TO REPAIR . HE needed to look into it further when im under the car saying WHERE IS THE DIRT ?? 


this man Derrick totally tried to scam me.. I was at the dealership for 3 hours and I still do not know what or why my car is leaking . I purchased a jeep Laredo and a jeep patriot fromt his dealership and they  tried to scam me.


DERRICK TRIED TO SCAM ME WITH A 800$ DIAGNOSIS. TOLD ME HE WOULD SHOW ME THE DIRT UNDER THE CAR AND WHEN I WAS UNDER THE CAR WITH HIM LOOKING THE ENTIRE STORY CHANGED AND IT NEEDS FURTHER DIAGNOSIS..

Just be sure you know what you want because like all other dealerships, you will be asked to purchase extra warranties and other miscellaneous additional addons. I ended up purchasing the 6 years oil change plus tire rotation for less than $400 which beats the price that will cost to bring the vehicle to auto shops for oil change and tire rotation.

274,"August 02, 2016","In search for my new car I stepped foot in many dealerships trying to find the new car I desired. 

Luckily living in Orange County there are no shortage of automobile dealerships, but what I came to realize finalizing my deal here is that there is only one dealership I will ever go back to. 

Huntington Beach Jeep took care of me and worked their butts off to get me, a first time buyer, into the car of my dreams. Every day I would pass by this dealership looking at all the shiny and pristine looking Jeep Wranglers (the SUV I ended up leasing), and finally after months of research and desire I took the first steps in getting into the vehicle I wanted.

From the test drive to the signature on the paperwork, I knew I was in good hands. 

There is a reason these guys and gals are the best in the country, they will fight for you. I can attest to that. They have my future business without a doubt.

Initially I made an appointment with an associate but when I arrived he wasn't available. I was immediately placed with a very helpful and well mannered gentleman named Cristian Serna. He made the test drive and buying process very smooth. Later I met with a Finance person named Nader Heidary.He was also great and didn't pressure me to make a quick decisions. He offered different options that would work for me and that made my decision very easy. I didn't have to wait too long to have my finance papers drawn up and before you know it, I was meeting with Finance Manager, Bobby Valenzuela to finalize my paperwork. 

These three gentlemen went above and beyond to get me in the car that I wanted for the monthly payment that I wanted and threw in some extras too.

291,"July 06, 2016","I had been planning on buying a Charger R/T for the last few months. I live in Oakland and travel to SoCal several times a year. I used to live in the LA area, so I knew that I could possibly get a better deal on a car in LA as compared to the Bay Area. I contacted the dealership through their website and was contacted by Mark O'Campo. I was in the looking stage (maybe/maybe not phase) trying to see if I could get a good deal on a 2015. Mark stayed in contact with me for a few months. I liked that HB CDJR put their prices on their website. There were about 2-3 Chargers that I was interested in and I would occasionally check the website for price changes and to see if they were still available. In the meantime, I contacted a couple of dealers in the Bay Area who told me they could give me a below invoice price on 2015s. To make a long story short, the HB price on the 2016s I was looking at were a lot less than the 2015s in the Bay Area. I visited the dealership around Memorial Day since I was in SoCal, and met Mark. I didn't buy a car that day. Mark explained the advantages of leasing as compared to buying. I knew that I would be back in SoCal a few weeks later. In the meantime the prices of the models I was looking at had dropped again. I knew that I needed to move on the one that I liked best before someone else did. I came into the dealership when I came back to SoCal and we made a deal that I was happy with. I did end up buying instead of leasing. The staff (Mark, Nick Haddad) worked hard to get a deal done with me. So yes, it was definitely worth coming from Oakland to buy a car here.",5.0

305,"May 30, 2016","Let me start with a little car buying history before I review Huntington Beach Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram. This will be lengthy but well worth the read, I promise!
I have had the worst luck buying cars the past few years. I went to a ‘well known’ dealer and they found me a wonderful car (I thought). I found out very soon after taking ownership with that car, the dealer had really sold me a lemon!! Not mentioning names but it was a Ford dealer you have all seen on TV I’m sure! After having the car for a few days it started having major problems. They said ‘come on down!’ We’ll fix it. They didn’t!! After many trips to them I finally took it to Chevrolet dealer who, since I had gotten the best maintenance warranty, fixed the car properly and it was finally the dream car I wanted. (No thanks to that Ford Dealer!) That car was in a terrible crash a few weeks ago and totaled so here I go again, looking for a little car to get me around. 
Made another mistake going to a small dealer this time. The same thing was happening… junk car!!  I have recently learned that being a Woman alone, you often find used car salesmen are known to take advantage of you. An honest one is hard to find! Well I will tell you where to go to find honesty now.
As I thought “what to do?”, I remembered back in 1997, while looking for a car I turned into a Jeep dealer on beach Blvd. in Huntington Beach basically making a U-turn. A salesman asked me if he could help me and I told him no, I was looking for a specific type of car, not a Jeep. When I described what I wanted, he told me to park and take a look at a little car he had there on their back lot. Well, the car he showed me was a used 1990 Mercury Topaz. This car turned out to be exactly what I wanted and I ended up getting the car and keeping that car from 1997 until 2013 when “it” was hit and totaled. During the time I had the car I never had a bit of trouble with it. Hardly even needed the usual tune-ups and such. It was a truly wonderful little car!
So after my latest problems with dealers, I remembered that Jeep Dealer and decided since they had done so good for me before, why not go back. I am so pleased that I did!! 
I pulled into Huntington Beach Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram at 16701 Beach Blvd Huntington Beach, CA, and parked. There was a salesman standing there and he offered to help me. This person was T. Wayne Clark, Product Specialist and Senior salesman, I found out later. I told him about a car I had seen advertised on their site and we went inside to discuss it. He spent a lot of time with me making sure he knew exactly what kind of car I had in mind and the price I was able to pay.  I was also worried at that time if I would be able to finance a newer car and had my price set to a pay cash price that was within my budget. 
T. Wayne spent a lot of time with me and made sure what he showed me matched my criteria and after we settled on a car he explained all the things I would need to know about the car and financing. After getting the information needed, he took the paperwork to the financing dept. and walked my application through. Once they were finished they and called me in, I was amazed the deal they found me for financing! A great price with the limited warranty and all the necessary extras in warranties and Gap protection included. That part was so easy! I must say I was in a state of disbelief at what had been worked out for me! And I also was please they were able to find financing at a really good price. Without them knowing, they had financed it through my Credit Union where I had been a member for 23 years! It’s often hard for a Woman alone to get a true good deal, but believe me, if you need a car and a really honest car salesman… go to Huntington Beach CDJ Ram and although they have a quality they demand from their salesmen, be sure to look up T. Wayne Clark and take advantage of his longtime history with this company and let him find you the car you are looking for. There is such as large collection of many types of used cars there you will surely find the one you want and be as pleased as I with the service and attention you will get there!
Thank you T. Wayne Clark for being there when I needed an honest and caring person to help me.

I wrote a hold check for a $2,000 down payment. All said and done, the balance I walked out with on the lease was over $38K. So I dont know what happened to the discount, I guess it just dissapeared! 5 days Later  when I brought the car back to have the navigation software installed, the car ended up in the shop for 68 days, thats right, 68 DAYS! needless to say we got deep onto California Lemon Law over this car. The sevice departmet was good about it, but Pete was not! I told them that I did NOT want them to deposit the down payment check until I had settled the case with Chrysler, a very reasonable request. Pete Shaver was rude and nasty and treated me like I was some kind of criminal bent on ripping him off for the $2K. I told him multiple times that once the matter was resolved I would honor my commitment. Well, that was not good enough for him. Not only was he rude and nasty about it, and accused me of trying to rip him off, he had his business office deposit the check BEFOR the issue was resolved. I put a stop payment on it. Once the matter with Chrysler was resolved, I paid the $2K. Then, I wanted to cancel one of the things I had purchased, that I did not know I had purchased! Some kind of a GPS trackng thing that cost $995. I remember when I bought the car the finanace guy went over everything so fast, I dont recall him telling me about it. I contacted the dealership to cancel that thing 6 weeks ago, I was told then that it would be 4 to 6 weeks for the refund which goes directly to Ally Financial, the leasing company. So today I noticed that Ally had not rceive the refund. I called the dealership, they said they had no record of it. The manager in the business office told me she would call me back after she did some research. She did and told me that Pete refused to issue the refund, like the crook he is! First he screws me blue on the car and then he wont refund me for something I did not want in the first place. Now I have a car with a horrible repair record that I owe $35K on that is worth, at best, $18K, hows that for a good deal? I'll bet on a trade I wouldent get $15. The car is a piece of junk, as I was told by no less then 2 Chrysler technicians one who works for Mr. Shaver. Way to stand behind your product fellas! When I first spoke to Pete Shaver he assured me that this car because of the model and equipment would be easy to get out of within 6 months, I believe his words were that I should be able to trade out if it in 6 months, he told me that knowing that the payment was much higher then I could afflord, I trusted him, and he burned me. Now I am stuck with a $824 a month lease payment with no way to get out, and he had to know that when he sold me the car, what a horrifically despicable person. People like Pete Shaver are the reason the car business has the reputation it does. Oh, and I inadvertently left a set of jumper cables in the Jeep when I traded it in and when I went back to retrieve them, they were gone, stolen by someone in the Pete Shaver universe. Stay away from Chryslers, stay away from Huntington Beach Chrysler Jeep, and above all else, stay away from Pete Shaver!",1.6
322,"April 25, 2016",Looking for a special vehicle for a long time. I had a ton of negative equity and many dealers could not do anything. I had been in contact with HB Jeep/Ram for a while.

323,"April 18, 2016","Found my dream car and drove up from San Diego, had preapproved loan in hand just needed to verify it was the car I wanted.   After waiting an hour to get appraisal, finally got into finance, I was assured final dealer prep would be done before I got and finance wouldn't take that long, wrong on both.  Even though my bank had instructions for EFT finance insisted I needed a cashiers check, I told the finance guy this was the 4th car I had purchased with this bank and never had they given me a check.  He also didn't know how to use their touch screen system, which is supposed to speed things up, it didn't, had to bring in another finance guy to show him.  Spent well over an hour in finance and was now in my 4th hour overall.  Well at least my car would be done...it wasn't, also prior to going into finance I had requested the my personalized tags and tire valve stems be put in my new car...finally the salesman brought the car out after another hour of waiting, now well into my 5th hour at dealership.  The salesman said he had to do the prep, even though the car is gorgeous still had stickers and some marks on window, but now I was just ready to leave.   The tags and valve stems weren't in the new car either, even though I asked...got on the road with less then 1/4 tank of gas, my wife said just go, we were starving so went across street to grab some dinner before starting back to San Diego.  Got call from salesman, he still had tags, still trying to be cheerful went back and grabbed them, asked him about a tank of gas and he said they had to cut back....so it wasn't an oversight, I just spent $60k on a car and they don't even give you a full tank of gas!  I was now in my 7th hour at dealer, figured I should just be happy and get on road...

2 weeks later I notice that HBD still hadn't paid off my bank for trade, even though they had already sold the car.  My wife called to sort out the problem and almost immediately the finance guy started yelling at her...she asks for his supervisor and he wouldn't let her talk either...I get on the phone and he tells me they have 13days by law to mail the check and they mailed a check on the 13th day, I asked why this wasn't brought up in finance and they basically accused me of lying, when I told him we had been assured they process it in'a couple of days'...could hardly get a word in and by now the conversation was becoming more heated...

I finally hung up knowing I'd get no where with these guys, LOVE MY CAR BUT HATE THIS DEALERSHIP, VERY FRUSTRATING TO DEAL WITH, DON'T GO HERE, THEY TREAT YOU LIKE CRAP!",1.4

The first salesman I encountered was incredibly arrogant, condescending and dismissive- I don't think he understood that cars are a commodity and therefore negotiable in price ( unless you're selling the new Bentley SUV) , and it's very easy to drive a few miles in any direction and find someone else selling the same thing, so your customer service skills are indicative of your success so you don't lose a sale to another dealership. Fortunately, Nader the sales manager noticed the situation, swooped in and took over and  and introduced me to some super friendly, personable and gracious sales staff. I was about to take my business elsewhere after that initial experience at the dealership that gave credibility to its negative Yelp reviews-  but because of the great customer service afforded by Nader Heidary and Chris Moody and Pat Bankemper, I purchased a new 2016 Wrangler Unlimited from HB Jeep.

362,"January 19, 2016","I purchased a  used vehicle from this dealer two weeks ago and the sales people during the test driving of this vehicle had to know that it was a hazard to the public and to its potential owner. This vehicles front and rear shocks were so far gone that changing lanes and striking the reflectors would make the car loose traction and essentially become ineffective in its stability on the road. During test drive of this vehicle was short and i did not put the vehicle on the highway to allow it to convey its full capacity. However, on the drive home is when i noticed the traction was not there, and it was bad enough to cause an accident during any lane change or even pavement one may have experienced. Ethically, this dealership should have pull the car in to the service department regardless of the current expenditures they may have invested into the resale of this vehicle. Upon the return of the vehicle to the dealer me and my passenger hit a dip lost traction  and almost met our demise nearly sideswiping a moving truck. Moreover, Allowing someone to drive off their lot with a potentially life ending journey to get a sale is not the standards your site conveys to the consumer. Please all i ask is do the right thing for the buyer, and not put anyone else life in danger for economical gain.

However, the Solitary reason there was no litigation conveyed to this Dealer for Mischievous practices is because of the Service Managers Conduct Mr. Jesse Robles saved the day by taking care of my needs, and ensuring that he would localize the primary issue causing the car to perform the way it did. Jesse is a Rock Star, and he had my car perform as it should have been once leaving the lot.

397,"September 11, 2015","Recently {9/5/15} I purchased a Jeep Cherokee from Huntington Beach Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram. 
We went to the dealership and were looking at cars on the lot. Soon Mr. Fred Tabesh noticed us and introduced himself and made himself available should we need further assistance. Fred was very polite, professional and was not pushy in any way. 
Fred was very knowledgeable about the vehicles and everything he said verified completely accurate when we double checked his information.
He listened to what we were looking for in a vehicle, and when we were ready he provided some choices for us that fit everything we were after. He really listened to us, unlike some sales people at other dealerships who just “wait to talk” but don’t really listen.
When we were ready to move forward to purchase a vehicle Fred was with us all the way through the process. He made us feel comfortable and relaxed while he worked through the paperwork and various departments involved in the process.
All of the people we worked with (manager of finance, David in the document signing etc) were very professional and courteous and also very kind and respectful to my children as well! They took the time to listen and answer my children’s questions too without ever belittling them or making them feel inferior!
We feel like we got a terrific deal and are confident we couldn’t have done better elsewhere, not with price or financing.
Definitely I will highly recommend Huntington Beach Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram {hbJeep.com} and Fred Tabesh to everyone! 
Anyone who wants a great deal, no-hassle process, no long drawn out all day event (efficient, expedient no-nonsense best deal ever) call Fred Tabesh 714-475-6605 or email him at Fred.Tabesh@hbjeep.com

UPDATE:
After discussing at length with my husband the price, affordable financing & complete package we received 9/5/15 from Fred Tabesh at Huntington Beach Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram we decided to return 9/10/15 and purchase an additional Jeep from Fred! We were originally in the market for 2 new cars and after we purchased the first one for our daughter we were so happy we went back a few days later and purchased a second one for my husband and I!

The second transaction was also amazing. There was no gimmick, trick or broken promises. Fred handled everything and made sure we were taken care of again, all the way through the process. Samir in the finance department was amazing as well. Even though it was evening, after a long hot day of work Samir took the time to go over every piece of paper and didn’t let us leave until any and all of our questions were answered!

There is no way a better deal could be found. They can’t be beat in price OR service!!

400,"August 27, 2015","This is the second car I have purchased from HB Chrysler Dodge Jeep RAM in about one month. The first had a few hitches and the contract finance department called me to correct the error, they accepted the fact it was their fault and that alone made me a return buyer. Their honesty was refreshing you don't find that much in a dealership unfortunately.
I started shopping a couple weeks ago for a car for myself and narrowed it down to a specific Jeep model that was not easy to locate.
The new car I bought on Saturday is a Willy's Wrangler, it is the car I wanted except for the color. I asked Fred Tabesh If I could order one, he said yes and it would take about 6 to 8 weeks. A long time but I would get exactly what I wanted. We decided to purchase one on the lot instead. 
There was a Willy's Wrangler there in Huntington Beach that had been brought from another dealer, at the request of a buyer. That dealer was one that lost my purchase because they lied about their inventory, I drove quite a ways to buy that Wrangler only to find they did not have that car. I felt a bit shady about buying the car that had been shipped there for another buyer, but Fred assured me that if their was no contract on a car that is was still for sale. 
I paid cash for my new car as well as the used one I bought last month. The only complaint I have about that is that the dealer, as well as most others out there, charge the buyer an additional $500 to pay cash. Kinda silly, they definitely have plenty of profit built into each sale. 
Maybe HB will start a new trend and eliminate that procedure?
Sincerely,
SB

408,"August 06, 2015","I went to the dealership to buy a vehicle yesterday. I called before making the 3 hour drive to confirm the vehicle was still available. I also told them I was buying it and asked if they would hold it for me if I made the drive. Tom told me they don't normally do that but would ask his manager. He put me on hold a minute and came back saying that his manager approved it. They would hold the vehicle for me to purchase if I drove down that day. I take off work early and head that way immediately. I arrive there and we immediately sit down to go through the numbers to make the purchase. Keep in mind, I agreed to the purchase price of the vehicle before making the trip. I did not haggle with pricing at all. It was the price on the front window which was a decent price for this vehicle. They run my credit which is approx 800 credit score and I'm approved for the loan amount. I'm also putting 7500 cash down. I decline their extended warranty that they continued to push on me. After declining that, there is still 2k in hidden fees according to the length of the loan, monthly payment, and the interest rate they are giving me. I could of used my own financing but wanted it to go smoothly as it was late in the day and my bank was closed. I agreed to the 5% which I knew I could refinance in a few months with Chase @ 1-2%. They wouldn't show me the total and were playing the normal sales hidden numbers game. I ask one question - the break down of the fees. I never get this. After sitting around waiting, Tom comes back and tells me he cannot make the deal because the vehicle just sold! We are in the middle of a contract and they sale it? They failed to tell me they were doing two contracts at the same time for the same vehicle! They wasted 7.5 hours of my time and did not keep their word. If you cannot hold a vehicle, say so. If you tell someone you will hold it; keep your word. Why waste my time, get a bad review, and run my credit if you are going to sale it to someone else after promising to hold it? Shady shady dealership and sales people. Beware!

415,"July 15, 2015","I bought a used FIAT 500 last week. The advertised price was $11,598 (add $500 if you pay cash).
I had cash, $12,500, every last penny I could put into the deal. The salesman kept asking what I could afford, I said, $11,598, he really wanted me to give him a payment I was comfortable with so that they could figure out their profit. My plan was cash, I knew my budget and I worked with the salesman for hours and he finally got the manager to agree to $12,799, out the door price with taxes, and title work. I had to borrow the extra $300 from family....
I got to the finance department and prepared myself for the threat of gloom and doom that awaited me and how if I purchased an extended warranty that all my worries would go away. The car had 13K miles on it and a factory warranty of 3/36, 5/50 so I did not need to pay for the extra warranty.
They place the documents for signing on a table top screen so you can't really ""see"" all of the contract, which is probably not a good idea and also how they got the next item by me. The finance person said, ""You will have 'free' Nitro refills on your tires for life."" He said it something like, get Nitro fills for life.... Not so free, there was a fee of $179.00 in the contract that I did not see while we were signing. 
There was a ""3 day return"" option added in without the customer asking for it. That little gem is a fee of $250.00 I refused and he kind of huffed and puffed a tiny bit about having to print out a form stating I refused that fee. A total of $448.00 in ""hidden"" fees. I looked up their ""Yelp"" ratings and found several other customers complained about the same thing only to be responded with a warning to read the contract. That is sad, but I guess they really need that $448 per car, they don't have a customer waiting area to speak of and the vending machines are outside in the repair department. 
The last complaint I have was regarding a phone call a few days later asking me for $972 to pay the vehicle taxes. I was taken a back on this one. The price was negotiated, the deal was made, the money was paid and now they said that a slight paperwork error was made and I owed the taxes. It would be impossible for a customer to renegotiate a contract after the sale and get back any money, so why would this dealer believe they could renegotiate with their customer after the fact? I let the finance person know that I would need to consult legal advice as to my position on this request for ADDITIONAL funds. I have found no where that the dealer can ask for more money legally, and have not heard from him again.
Don't buy here unless you are very careful, make sure the salesman knows you can use a calculator to determine the actual cost of the vehicle you wish to purchase. Know the taxes for the county you are purchasing from, and get an idea of the vehicle tag costs too.
The price was reasonable and that is the reason I am giving it a 3 star. The salesman was really nice, personable, and I would buy a car from him again..... but he had no leverage, it was all up the the sales manager on duty that night which really prolonged the process.",3.0

During both purchases, we were given numbers up front and given straight answers that resulted us buying a Dodge Charger and Jeep Wrangler.  However, I wanted to express the disappointment my wife and I had during the negotiations at HB Jeep - New Car Sales and Used Car Sales the last two evenings.

On 06/16, upon our arrival at the HB Jeep new car sales, my wife and I was greeted by Stephanie.  Initially, we wanted to purchase a Dodge Caravan, which was indicated on the website as in stock, however, after Stephanie did some research, it was sold the previous night.  So, we test drove a new 2015 Town and Country Touring.  We decided to leave because we did not agree on the numbers because there was too much upside down on both vehicles.

On 06/17 my wife and I returned to HB Jeep Used Car Sales and we were greeted by Francisco.  We asked Francisco if we can see the 2011 Dodge Caravan that was advertised on the site and he found it after some time.  Because it was in a poorer condition and missing options we wanted, we decided to test out another vehicle, 2014 Chrysler Town and Country.  We liked the vehicle, we decided to sit down and negotiate.  Again, my wife and I decided to leave because we would be at the same payments.

After both visits, we were contacted by Pete Shaver to see if there was anything that he could do to make us happy customers.  Unfortunately, we've already gone another route to purchase a vehicle.

423,"May 24, 2015","Best car buying experience I ever had (and I bought over 10 new cars over the years).
I knew exactly what I want (Cherokee Sport with certain options) and was able to find a few cars on HB website with the best price around (beat Truecar and Costco).
They do not deduct the Military or lease rebates from their price, but show it as option only if you qualify (not like many other dealers who advertised price includes the discount) 
I checked with 6 other dealers (I'm from San Diego and Memorial day traffic is never something I like to go through) and HB Jeep had by far the best price for this car ( and other dealers warn me they will try to push all options on me to add to the price).

To make long story short, our sale guy Jack W.  was the best sale guy I ever dealt with. He listened when I told him exactly what I want and went above and beyond to get me the exact car I wanted, didn't try to push extra options (which I communicated up front that I won't take ) and made this a great buying experience.
The follow up in finance with Bob was the same great experience, he understood I don't want extra options, went right away over the details and explained every point of the deal.
We were done with Bob in less than 30 minutes and picked up our new great Cherokee at a great price.
As I told Jack when I left - I will buy my next car at HB Jeep and will ask for him to be my sale man.

This experience is the reason for my 1st review ever on dealerrater and if I do another, it is most likely be on HB Jeep again.

As mentioned, Milton and I communicated for a few weeks leading up to my visit. He was very good about keeping in touch via phone and email.

439,"April 13, 2015","I usually don't mind the car buying experience as it is usually an exciting time for most. However compared to my previous 4 car purchases this one was extremely exhausting and lasted several days. My sales rep would disappear for 30 minutes at a time whenever he would go get a vehicle off of the lot and when we were ready to purchase the 1st day he tried handing us off to another sale rep. which made my wife get up and walk out after spending 6 hours there already. 

I returned the next day, a glutton for punishment i guess, only to come up with a deal after another 5-6 hours and then have them change the deal on me again after agreeing stating that they misunderstood the what the sales person wrote down. The fact of the matter is that I would of and should of purchased through Kent Carr aka. Coach at TuttleClick in Irvine using Costco pricing with no hassle or even TuttleClick of Tustin using AAA and the pricing which both are pleasant experiences. The only reason I continued with HB Jeep is because of the reputation and work from Todd MacDonald with the accessories department as Todd was very insightful and gave me everything i wanted as I did add new wheels, tires, and 3.5"" lift, and back-up camera to my Jeep, you can thank him for saving this deal.

I also tried to follow up with my sales rep since he never followed up with me in regards to the MorseGPS system that I paid way too much for and no one in any department knew who my sales rep was and never heard of his name as they passed me around between new car sales, to used car sales, back to new car sales, and then to finance where i was finally left on hold for over 25 minutes before i hung up, yes i did give them the benefit of the doubt. Anyway when I called back I asked for the service department which was helpful in tracking down the correct person who emailed the information I needed to use the MorseGPS system. I know when i purchase my next vehicle I will most likely use Costco or AAA as my previous experiences using those services were great! I would however still consider purchasing my accessories and having them installed by Todd and his team as they were all professional up front with everything.

What I forgot to mention is that when I brought a certified check from the credit union after the weekend it still took me 30 minutes to find someone to accept the check, very strange!

PS - Pete Shaver I know you have ads and send blanket emails stating that if we have any issues to contact you however you don't make your number easily available which is unfortunate. I was looking for it when I was in the lobby trying to give someone my check.

Sorry to be brutally honest but I hope this is used in a positive way so others do not have the same experience.

441,"April 02, 2015","I must tell you, In the collection of automobiles that I've purchased - this  car buying experience was the worst that I've ever had. 

 

I initially inquired about a Ram truck online, and was contacted by Robert Bauer. I spoke to him on the phone and by email a couple of times and made an appointment to see him. I arrived at our scheduled meeting time, and he wasn't in yet. I waited about a half hour and he finally arrived, I introduced myself and he had no clue what I was interested in or seemingly who I was. He finally pulled up my info and proceeded to find my truck - I waited another half hour. He took me for a test drive, and when I inquired about the air suspension option and standard warranties he said that I really didn't need those options. After the test drive, we went inside to discuss price and an already lackluster experience spiraled out of control. I told him what I thought the truck was worth, he was offended and said that the dealership was already discounting it. So I tried to get an out the door price from him and he said that he couldn't do that till I was in finance. I explained that part of my decision making process was knowing the finance options , and he retorted by pressuring me to make a decision. I said that I wouldn't make a decision without the numbers in front of me and I didn't like his sales tactic. I said that we were done and he told me to take his card - and that ""you'll be back""

Fast forward two days -  I was still very dissatisfied with the experience at the dealership, but I decided that I would give it another go. I asked to speak to a manager and got Nick Farber. I explained the situation and he said that he would take care of me personally and try to make the situation better. I asked for an out the door price and he said that was against company policy.  I made an appointment with him for 9:30 AM on Friday March 27th. He called me later that day and said that he would be tied up in a meeting and wouldn't be available till 10:30, I agreed and appeared at the dealership as agreed. When I spoke tot he receptionist, she told me that Nick wasn't there, finally another manager told me that he wasn't in yet that morning and wouldn't be in till noon. At that point I was pretty irritated because he had blown my appointment off - I was told that Dan would be helping me in Nick's absence. Dan had no clue about the situation, so I had to explain everything all over again. I had secured financing with my credit union and had decided to go that way, I asked Dan to get me an out the door price so that I could make a decision. He told me that I would need to fill out a credit application so that he could take it to his manager before he could get me an out the door price. I went round and round with him, and explained that since I already had approved financing I just needed to know what the final price was going to be! He came back by telling me that I was being difficult, and that he thought that we were done. I was furious, and raised my voice. Another manager came over, and I asked to speak to the sales manager - after about 5 minutes Danny came over and spoke to me. He agreed that I didn't need to do a complete credit application since I was using my own financing. He got me an out the door price with all the incentives that were available, and I hesitantly agreed to make the purchase. 

He then sent me to Tom Cruz' office to complete the paper work. Tom had no idea who I was or what was going on, again I had to explain the situation and waited for them to get things together. Soon after that Nick Farber arrived, and took over the process- I was not happy at all by then. 

Finally, I went into the finance manager's office and explained that I was very frustrated and would like to make this as quick as possible. I explained that I wanted NO extras, however he proceeded to try to hard sell me an extended warranty, paint / interior protection, a maintenance plan, alarm, etc. I explained that I wasn't interested, and he persisted, and I lost it. I ended up signing the papers and getting out of your dealership as quickly as possible. 

In good conscience I could not suggest this dealership to anyone nor would I be likely to purchase from them again. It seems that customer service is the last priority at this dealership, and that hard selling / sleazyness is the corporate culture. If I'm contacted by Ram, I will let them know what my experience was like and how dissatisfied I still am with it. ",1.8
442,"March 25, 2015","I purchased a 2011 used 4 runner on 1/15/15. In March, I brought  the car in for it's complimentary oil change. The service department was wonderful! I was informed at that time that I needed new brakes. Bobby in the service department tried to work with the used car department but they refused to budge. He argued with them that I had only had the car two months. George Khoury, executive sales manager in used cars, would do nothing. So, I went across the street myself to talk to him. He said he could do nothing. He would be losing money. He is the epitome of the sleezy used car dealers. No wonder they have such  bad reputations. I have spoken to several mechanics since then and all of them agree I should not have needed new brakes after only 2 months. So I don't know what he did to make the brakes pass or they were just a fraction above the legal limit. I really liked this place and was going to recomend it to several friends but not after dealing with their executive sales mgr. George Khoury.

From the time we called on the phone, and eventually drove off the lot in our new JEEP, the staff was professional, courteous and above all focused on our needs as a customer. Prior to this, I was on chat line, on another JEEP dealers website looking for a specific vehicle, options etc and one of my parameters was a black jeep. The customer service person sent me a link for a red jeep and asked if ""this would fit my needs?"". Our experience here was people listened to what we were looking for and then showed us vehicles that matched up to those options. Brody was excellent at understanding our needs as customers, not being our first car purchase, Brody was quick to ascertain this and adjusted his approach to fit our needs.

456,"February 18, 2015","Called and e-mailed concerning a new 2014 Jeep Cherokee, was assured the car was still available.  Upon arrival at the dealership, I was informed the gentleman I was communicating with was busy and Tom Cruze gave me John Dreyer to help me.  John said the Cherokee was at their offsite storage area and drove me to that lot and proceeded to frantically look for the Jeep finally giving up in what seemed to be forever as I was standing among all of these dirty dusty vehicles in an unpaved parking area.  John was kind enough to allow me to drive another Cherokee back to the dealership so I could at least access whether I wanted a 4 cylinder Cherokee.  Back at the dealership he again began trying to locate the vehicle and somehow determined that is was at another lot and someone had disabled the GPS system the dealership uses to keep track of the vehicles.  Well, he finally got the vehicle to show me which was caked with dust and the wheels looked like it had been doing some off-roading.  This all took over an hour and a half and I had to leave for another appointment.  I called John when I got home and arranged for an appointment at 10 am the next day to perhaps close the deal on the car, he assured me the Cherokee was still available and someone would be there to appraise my trade-in.  Arrived at 10 am, John was there but no Cherokee, so he ran off to find it again.  I sat cooling my heels for 30 minutes and finally sent him a text to find out what in the world was going on.  He informed me he could not get in the gate at the offsite lot and was waiting for someone to open it - he said "" we just opened and I should understand that with over 2000 new cars, it is hard to keep track of them etc, etc"". I sent him another text to see if the trade-in could be looked at while I was waiting and was informed by John that he could not locate the used car guy.  I waited another 20 minutes and then left.  What I do not understand is why he did not arrange to have the vehicle ready and detailed for me to look at seeing that I showed a genuine interest in buying it and had made an appointment.

459,"February 15, 2015","I was looking for a new crossover SUV and researched for a week or two and spent countless hours looking at different models, specs and packages. I narrowed it down to 13 different models. Then I went to each of the different manufacturers that I had chosen (some had multiple vehicles that I was interested in) and looked in and around the car. Seeing it in person is much different than pictures on websites. My first meeting with Brent Melbon was in instant connection. He was different from other manufacturer's salesmen. He was never pushy and answered all my questions. He didn't try to get his sales manager to push me into buying like many of the other lots. I told him that I was narrowing my search to 5 and then I'd test drive the 5 I had chosen. After visiting all 13 vehicles I was interested in possibly purchasing, I went back to Jeep and he was there again. He helped me with the Jeep Cherokee Sport and after visiting the other 4 manufacturers, I did more research and did a comparison of each vehicle. It was a no brainer. The value is at Huntington Beach Chrysler, Jeep, Dodge, Ram. They deal in volume and have huge discounts that smaller lots do not have. I am completely happy with my vehicle and happily recommend them to anyone wishing to purchase a vehicle. One last thing---Many people dread purchasing a new car due to the salesmen and the haggling. There is almost nothing to haggle here because the prices are so low. Do the research yourself. The cars sell themselves and Brent Melbon was the icing on the cake!",4.8

464,"January 22, 2015","My experience with this dealership can only be described as a totally farce.

Having to move from the east coast to the LA area for a new job, I needed to find a car quickly and remotely. After lots of searching I found (on AutoTrader) what appeared to be a great deal at this dealer. Since I lived in Washington DC, I wanted to put a deposit down and secure the car. I called the dealership and spoke with Francisco. He seemed to not really know much about the car or how anything worked at the dealership. Eventually I got the information I needed and made an offer. Matt - the 'internet manager' - called me to say that they'd accepted my offer. After making the deposit (which for some reason took three people to get right and an inability to use the mute button on the phone while they fumbled and cursed in the background), I asked Matt to send me a breakdown of the cost, registration, taxes, etc... and that I'd be in several weeks later to pick the car up. Two weeks later and I still didn't have any of the information I asked for. Meanwhile, Francisco called me several times and asked if I was still interested in the car. After reminding him that I'd already purchased it, I further reminded him that I hadn't received the requested paperwork. At this point I'm already suspecting that these guys are totally incompetent, but couldn't imagine that they'd screw up any more. I was wrong. Very wrong. Three weeks after putting down the deposit and two days before I was to fly out to LA to start my new job, I get a call from Matt: 'We accidentally sold your car.' He said he'd tried calling me a week ago when it first happened but 'for some reason the phones weren't working.' When I pressed him for more information, he tried to sell me a another car for the same price. A few minutes later he said 'Sorry I didn't get back to you sooner but I just found out yesterday.' WHAT? At that point I asked for my deposit back and to call me when the refund was processed. Two days later and I've still not received any deposit refund, nor has anybody returned my calls.

My visit started with speaking with Noah Pike over the internet and then speaking with Nancy Nevin once at the lot. All the guys at Huntington Beach Chrysler Jeep Dodge RAM were Awesome! 
No pressure and easy to deal with. Nancy is friendly and not your typical ""sales"" man, he is there to make sure you are happy and take care of you.
They were able to work with us even with our minimal down payment and not so hot credit. We drove away as a Happy Customer of theirs in our New (new to us) Jeep Limited with Hemi. We were even able to get a great warranty!

The selection of vehicles to choose from at HB CDJR was awesome and I easily found the trim and color I wanted with the options that mattered most to me.

Before coming to the Dealership, my wife and I went on line to check out their inventory.  We saw the the car we liked, Chrysler 300 S, and the following day we went to just ""look.""  We met up with Duane Sexton, who was very personable, professional and he answered all our questions.  Everyone we met was very friendly and helpful.  Everything went pretty smooth except for the ""bottleneck,"" in getting the paper work done.  It took four hours... 

Overall, the experience was great and we highly recommend Huntington Beach Jeep Dodge Chrysler to our friends and family.

482,"November 18, 2014","A used car was posted online at $17899.  We went to buy the vehicle and low and behold the numbers were not adding up.  We know that on average tax/license fees total to approx 10% of purchase price.  This salesperson kept quoting about $2700-$3000 of closing costs which didn't make sense.  So when we were working the numbers out it just didn't make sense.  We asked to see the workout sheet and when it arrived the taxes, doc fees, registration all added up correctly but we couldn't figure out why the price was about $1000 over what we were adding up.  Then in a little line item directly under the price that is advertised for this vehicle online, was a weird term ""aftermarket"" and $774 added to the price of the vehicle.  So be very wary of buying anything from this underhanded used sales deparment.  We even asked the salesman to explain the line item and he blew us off and basically said he had tried his best!  I think they could be held liable for false advertising but I would rather pay $1000 more anywhere else, than wait forever to be messed around with.",1.8

He never once tried to sell me a truck i did not want he constantly emailed me links of trucks that he thought i would be interested in.

487,"October 29, 2014","My wife and I were greeted by Mr. Fred Tabesh at Huntington Beach and helped us with our selection. My initial option was a soft top, but Fred's helpful tips convinced me to go with a hard top model and under no pressure what so ever. Withing two hours, my wife and I drove away with our new red color Jeep Wrangler and I have never been happier with my purchasing experience during my 53 years of driving and owning various cars. In fact, the entire dealership experience was positive including finance manager Paul K., sales manager Eddie B., sales concierge Nick C. and parts advisor John H.

488,"October 29, 2014","I would like to start with the dealership. I was very impressed with the large selection of Jeeps and the amazing pricing.  There was no dealership within a 20 mile radius that could beat the prices being advertised at Huntington Beach.  The Huntington Beach Jeep Dealership's exterior and interior appearance is very pleasing, and the atmosphere was inviting. The pricing, discounts, and selection cut out all the hassle of haggling and made my car buying experience easier. They even offered me almost double what the competitors were offering on my trade in. Tom, the sales specialist, was very kind and patient with me while we went over all the details of my car. It seems like everyone was so kind and welcoming.
	My sales reprehensive, Dan Powers, has honestly changed the way I now view buying a car.  He never once pushed me into buying a car, and I never received harassing phone calls. Dan always had a calm relaxed vibe that really helped me since I was so stressed out with this being such a large purchase and also my first car purchase.  When we communicated through email he replied almost instantly, he was always happy to work around my busy work schedule and stay late at my request.  What really made him stand out above the rest is the amount of effort he spent to help me find a car.  He would cut my workload in half by keeping me updated on current inventory of new arrivals with all the accessories I was looking for and within my price range. When we would sit for hours discussing pricing he never made me feel like I was wasting his time, even when we couldn't settle on a price. He didn't try to pressure me into financing with the dealership and even walked me through my financing paperwork to make sure I understood everything.   His constantly reassurance in finding me my perfect car always kept me optimistic.  I was so impressed with all the great customer service that I decided to stop doing business with other dealerships and only work with Huntington Beach Jeep   After this amazing car buying experience I would recommend this dealership to everyone I know. Throughout this car buying experience I felt I had made new friends and wasn't seen as a just a sale. 
	On a side note, I did have some issues with the financing department, but Richard Lee was very professional and cleared up the situation.  He offered me a tank of gas and a free oil change for the inconvenience.  This dealership truly values its customers and should take great pride in its customer service.  I am glad I chose Hunting Beach Jeep as my dealership and I look forward to continuing my service with them in the future.

He was so friendly and professional. I had to put my buying experience
on hold due to some family medical issues, but still needed to purchase
a new truck. I called Jim on Saturday to see if he would be working on
Sunday. He said he was not scheduled to work but remembered me and said
that he would come in. He had a family event to attend but he still came in to
help me find my new truck. The entire staff at Huntington Beach Ram was so
unlike any other dealer I have ever been to before. Top notch #1 all the way !

492,"October 06, 2014","I had a rough start with this dealership. I found the exact car I wanted on Cars.com, then worked with an internet sales representative to get the deal lined up and ready to deliver the vehicle. That evening, I received an email saying ""bad news, [the car] was sold."" No real apology. Fortunately, they worked very hard to save my business by finding an alternative to the car I wanted and offered me a reasonable discount for my troubles. It took almost a full week longer to buy the car than I thought, but at the end of the day I got the car I wanted, at the price I wanted and am satisfied. They have one outstanding item to add when the parts arrive. Will update if that does not go smoothly, but overall I would say that they recognized a mistake and worked hard to correct it and keep my business. I am definitely a fan of Pete the GM who intervened twice to keep the deal on track. ",3.6

During the last purchase, I wanted to decline their option to bring back the vehicle within 3 days which they charged $317 for.  They said if I declined they would raise the net price to include that option.  They said the price was reduced by that amount during negotiations and if I declined it would just be added back on. They also refused to decline a nitrogen tire fill contact for $179.  That's $496 worth of optional services I wished to decline.  I ended up buying the vehicle, but I know now what they do to reduce their initial sticker price just to refuse to let you decline optional services.

When we got back to the salesroom,  Jim Beltran took great care of us and got the paper work going.  We paid the exact amount that was listed on the internet and received the exact amount that we were quoted for our trade in.  The deal was clean with no haggling.

We will definitely recommend you to our friends.

Chris Mason helped us consider some very attactive options.  Chris was fine with us passing on the options and didn't put through the sales ringer, as is the case with so many other dealerships.

Joe, in finance, was quick and accomodating.  Honestly, I don't ever recall getting out of the finance guy's office in less than 1/2 hr in my life.  Joe explained a couple of optional add ons but quickly realized that we just wanted to get out of there with the lowest possible payment and total cost.  

Finally, Bert took directly to the van and demonstrated the features, such as Stow and Go seating and blue tooth. 

BTW: We just love the fact that all the seats fold into the floor except the 2 front bucket seats.  Actually, it's more like the seats through themselves into the floor like a sceen from the Transformer movie.

I am a college student so I figured I'd bring my parents as a support group and we all worked together with both Michael and Travis to finish the night with a new vehicle.

I am definitely going to be encouraging family and friends to stop by and just get some feedback in terms of buying a new vehicle or even a used one too.  

Also, the sale concierge, Nick also was very friendly in guiding me with the options I had within the car.  He politely showed me the accessories and technology available inside the Dodge Dart.

The car is stick shift and neither my husband or me knew how to drive stick shift. The sales rep was nice enough to show my husband how to drive the car when we went in to look at it. They made the whole process very easy although it was a very lengthy process. We were there for about 4 hours. I was a little put off by the fact that the sales rep did not know how to respect my personal space. He continually stoon much too close to me and did not back up when I tried to put a little distance between us. When we were done with financing and ready to take the car home they took it to get detailed. I am not sure what their version of detailing a car is but what they did was not what I would have expected. I found trash stashed under the seats, the windsheald had streakes, and there were fingerprints on the windows.

It doesn't end when you purchase the car, that's only the beginning :) I tormented him for 8 long grueling hours before signing the papers and never once did he loose his cool or try to persuade me into something I didn't want.

541,"June 24, 2014",Huntington Beach CDJR staff is friendly and very helpful.  Bobby Webb is awesome !    We drove a long way to buy a car from Bobby and it was worth the drive.  He prepped the cars we were interested in and had them ready for us when we arrived.  He made the buying experience easy and enjoyable.  Huntington Beach Jeep is No#1.  ,5.0

543,"June 16, 2014","I have wanted a jeep wrangler style vehicle for a few years and just waited til my current vehicle lease was at the end of term.  After looking at two other dealers I decided to check out HB Crysler Dodge, especially since I live in Huntington Beach, and I am sure glad I did.  Jim Beltran and of the supporting staff were extremely helpful, patient and kind especially when I kept asking to see other models up until the time I finally made up my mind.  The Sahara it was!

I will rate this dealership 10 of 10 ",5.0
545,"June 09, 2014","    Tomas and Johnny were fantastic. My wife and I really appreciated their no pressure sales approach. We knew what we wanted and they didn’t push nor try to mow us over with something we didn’t want. We got exactly what we wanted and even more. Great experience. They were straight to the point and we never ever got that “being sold” feeling you get with some salespersons. My wife and I were immediately at ease talking with them about what we wanted.

    Mike in finance. He really knows his stuff. We were dreading that part of purchasing a car. In previous experiences, it was a nightmare when the finance person manages to add all kinds of things with the feeling of being sold. But NOT there. He was up front. He showed us options and gave us bottom line information and never once pushed, which was refreshing. When we left his office we felt really good about the decision that we made.

    Chris P did our delivery. He answered all the questions we had about the vehicle. In addition, he helped setup the hands-free before leaving the dealership.

    You have a great crew there. We've already told our friends of the great experience and we will be looking to trade in our 2nd vehicle as we’ve already decided to come back there to do it.

    Thanks for a great experience.",5.0

551,"May 06, 2014","I've been thinking about buying a new car for 2 years. I had finally settled on a Dodge Challenger R/T and have been researching where to buy for several weeks. There is a particular color for the R/T manual transmission I was interested in which is not easy to locate on the dealer lots. I did find one at a Los Angeles County dealer, but I was hesitant to buy there because of their reputation. I already knew Huntington Beach Dodge had a solid reputation and originally visited with sales person Noah Lacken and he informed me that when we were ready to buy, it could be done if they didn't have it on the lot. Some weeks after that we were ready to buy and were assisted by sales person Ron Williams. I informed Ron that the car I wanted was at another dealer. He assured me Huntington Beach Dodge would acquire it for us from that dealer and have it ready for our purchase. The day finally came when the car was available to us and it was the exact car; they had acquired it from the other dealer, no problem! The sales transaction went very smoothly and the finance department was very accommodating to our needs. We are very happy with the car and Huntington Beach Dodge!",5.0
552,"May 06, 2014","This dealership was great for my purchase of a 2014 Chrysler Town & Country Touring! Their website already has major discounts that I wasted days negotiating back and forth (by emails and phone) with other dealerships and Huntington Beach Chrysler was still the lowest right from the start.

Our salesman was Patrick Sammons and he was amazing! Very professional and courteous, no hassle at all regarding the vehicle or negotiations. The sales manager was super friendly and I had some great conversations with the staff there. They even gave me a great quote on my trade in vehicle that was already higher than other dealerships and carmax quoted me at, even with the major discounts they already had on my new vehicle. Other dealerships played number games with me, devaluing my trade in and saying they couldn't do it because they were discounting the new vehicle so much already. Huntington Beach discounted the new vehicle lower and gave me more money on my trade in! 

Don't know anything about the service department here, brand new vehicle, won't need it for a while. But the sales staff was extremely friendly and with such a great sales experience here, I will try out their service department when it comes time for, and and hopefully their service staff has the same friendly, no hassle, and discounted price as well!",5.0

558,"April 25, 2014","This was the worse vehicle purchasing experience that I've ever had. I went in and drove a new Durango RT based on an ad at a specific sale price. The salesman and finance guys negotiated the deal, sale price and payment terms on a car that I'd never even seen or driven. The claim is that there was a mix up with the inventory ID. All of a sudden the car that I drove was NOT the one in the ad. The one I drove was more expensive of course and had AWD. The dealer in attempt to ""make things right"" insisted on working to match the deal as close as possible on the car that I drove. It suddenly became a numbers game on the monthly payment amount in attempt to meet close to the payment amount and terms that was originally pitched on the car with less features. Consequently, I ended up with a car that was out of scope of what we originally planned for the purchase. We were handed of to 3 different salesmen during this process, which made it even more of a unnerving experience. It was a completely confusing and misleading process from the car to the warranty, where the finance guy uses the misleading terms that the warranty covers ""everything"" for as long as you own the car. Lifetime warranty, yes, but it doesn't cover everything. ",1.8
559,"April 23, 2014","Jay Asefi better know as ""Cool Breeze"" was awesome.  No pressure, no nonsense, and straight to the point.  This was the best purchasing experience ever.

561,"April 22, 2014","My wife and I drove from San Diego to Huntington Beach Chrysler Dodge Jeep to buy a new Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited.  Huntington Beach Chrysler Dodge Jeep by far had the lowest prices in southern California.  When we arrived we were met by salesman Shawn Nakhjavani.  We told Shawn exactly what we were looking to buy and he quickly showed us two different models.  My wife and I soon decided on the Jeep we wanted and Shawn seamlessly executed the sale.  Shawn was very friendly throughout the process, which made the experience that much more enjoyable!  After signing all the paperwork another staff member took the time to explain and orientate us with all the features of our new Jeep!  My wife and I are extremely satisfied with our car buying experience and would recommend Shawn Nakhjavani and Huntington Beach Chrysler Dodge Jeep to any perspective car buyer!!

572,"March 24, 2014","I have purchased 11 new vehicles over 8 years and this by far was the absolute worst experience I have ever had the displeasure of experiencing. I wanted to pay cash for a jeep patriot and pick it up in 5 days. I got the complete run around from these clowns. For some odd reason me paying cash had to be approved. Everyone I talked too talked over me and did not listen. How many times did I have to say I did not need financing? Well atleast 10 because no one listens. How many times was I told I do not matter? In many ways atleast 5.They basically treated me like trash because I was not there to pick up the vehicle TODAY.  They stated we have customers here now and your not. I ended up purchasing from Van Nuys Dodge along with another new vehicle that my son happen to see Van Nuys was a good dealer and took the very little time required to complete the deal. 

Do yourself a favor if you want to be treated like a human being and be heard do not buy a vehicle from Huntington Beach Dodge. The whole experience was a nightmare.How can you screw up a easy cash deal. I wire you the money and pick up the vehicle in 5 days. Why is that so difficult? 

Why did the sales manager Sean pass me off to a new sales person that had no clue about anything? Because they don't care.If you want more information on this horrible dealer email me @kenronni@yahoo.com. if you want first class service and a great experience call Dennis Dillon Dodge and have your vehicle delivered they have the best prices in the country and will make any transaction easy and take the time to LISTEN to your needs.

He was very low pressure and I went into the dealer today to test drive the Caravan. Again, Greg was helpful, knowledgeable, and low pressure. There was no BS. The sales manager and financing staff were equally helpful and the price of the vehicle was lower than I believe I would've gotten elsewhere. In addition, the process today was very speedy.

They were very knowledgeable about the products.  We love this dealership for their prices.  Absolutely the best around. My husband did his homework and we kept coming back to this dealership.  The new facilities are so nice and welcoming.  Another great addition to the dealership is the walk through with the techs.  NICK -- gave us a tour of the whole store and what it has to offer.  He was so patient and answered all of our questions.  Then when we got the car he walked us through the whole car -- never rushing us.  We totally felt comfortable with the car when we left.  We couldn't be happier with our whole experience with buying our car.  Again -- Dan, Noah and Nick were amazaing.  Johnny the asst sales mgr is always a joy to meet with -- he is very personable and easy to work with.  I can't say enough great things about the staff and the dealership.  Thanks again --

584,"February 26, 2014","I recently bought a brand new Jeep from Huntington Beach Chrysler Dodge Jeep RAM. It was a wonderful experience. The purchase was orchestrated with the help of two gentlemen, Julian Blaseio and Jerry Fontaine. Both extremely friendly, helpful and knowledgable individuals. They were able to answer any and every question I had with integrity and made a lasting impression in my first experience purchasing a vehicle. I was in and out within a few hours, from the test drive to the final signing of financial documents. I had previously spent my time looking for used cars that were in my price range, but when I showed up at Huntington Beach Jeep, I was able to widen my scope to brand new 2014 vehicles because of there amazing prices! I was given an incredible deal and both individuals worked with my financial needs and constraints. I appreciate all of their help and will certainly be back to visit from time to time.

589,"February 23, 2014","We went to 5+ dealerships before coming, from San Diego, to Huntington Beach dealership and they were the BEST. We were greeted as soon as we got out of our vehicle by Patrick Sammons. We had a fantastic experience with him from showing us the vehicle we were interested in, test driving and getting us at a place money wise we were very satisfied with. He made this simple! Explained thoroughly what everything meant, answered every question we had and was very up front once we got into the ""numbers"". They are a very busy dealership, however, we felt very attended to and taken care of from beginning to end. 

One of the great and rare things about HB dealership is that their sales associates do not work on commission!! All their associates are on salary. While they are motivated to get you into a vehicle, if they sell a car to you for $25,000 vs $15,000 it does not effect what they earn. To me, that is fantastic! That means that now we are both equally motivated to get us into our dream vehicle at a price we are comfortable with. Again, Patrick, can't thank you enough for a fantastic car buying experience with you!!

Once into the finance office we worked with Samir Roufaeil. We love Samir. I wont get into the very long story that lead up to us driving home in our new 2014 Jeep Cherokee, however, thanks to Samir we did just that. He went above and beyond to make sure we were 100% taken care of!! He gave us his direct phone number to call him with anything we might need. We have already called once and he took care of what we needed immediately. Samir is the best financial manager we have ever worked with!!

Have to mention Chris Piasecki, Dan and Nick that work in the parts department as well!! I'm not kidding every department that we went through had THE best customer service!! You don't get that at your typical dealership!! These guys took ample time to make sure our vehicle was pristine and that we knew every possible feature that it came equipped with. We felt like their number one priority while I'm confident they were very busy. 

If you are in the market for buying a car, we would HIGHLY recommend giving this dealership your time before making a decision!!! We looked online at Edmunds and Cars.com's reviews to see where to go and we are so grateful for the raving reviews because it motivated us to check them out which lead to our finding and purchasing the exact car we were looking for!!

591,"February 22, 2014","From the beginning to end this transaction was simple and straight forward, exactly how it should be. I found the vehicle online after searching the Chrysler/Ram website because my local dealer had said he didn't have what I wanted and he couldn't find one after a 20 minute search, then wanted me to look at something else! The truly great part about this was that Michael and I were able to talk through the process over the phone, come to a tentative agreement where I was comfortable driving the 65 miles to view my trade in and come to a final agreement. Once I arrived at the dealership Michael and Travis quickly worked their magic and actually gave me $500 more than my own estimated trade in value.... All that was left to do was the paperwork, all went very well.... Everyone at the dealership from Michael & Travis in sales to Finance, to prep and even the guy that explained the features were both friendly and professional.

With little to no customer service, I was ready to give up. I came across Huntington Beach Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram, on Auto Trader. Over the phone Travis Sorensen ( Internet Manager ) made me feel confident and secure to make the drive to HB. Not only did Travis get me into the SUV I've been wanting, he got me into a NEW SUV at the price of most used cars I had perviously viewed. He was the most friendliest and least pushy of all Sales People I encounter  while buying this car, and out of all the other  eleven car purchases I have made in the past. Overall the staff at HB was great! From the receptionist at the door to Sam Massuro "" Delivery Specialist "" Showing me how all the controls worked inside my new Jeep Compass. I will be recommending Travis and his team to my friends, family and co workers. I am definitely buying my next car from Travis. This is how buying a new car should be.

I will refer all my clients to your dealership from now on. Samir made sure I was taken care of with financing even though my scores were not that good and told me all my extra options with care for my future financial security. Great rates, low price, fast process and awesome customer service. Thanks to the management for picking out great staff and not encouraging them not to take from customers, but give the best customer service I have ever had. Base pay was the best choice. It encourages employees to care about the customer and not think about just surviving financially. I wish this way of doing business would catch on in other dealerships. Exceptional job to all Huntington Beach Jeep, Dodge, Chrysler Staff.

601,"January 25, 2014","Met with Dan Powers to assist me in finding my new Jeep vehicle. Walked my family and I through the many lots to help me find the exact vehicle that best suited me. I wound up trading in my VW GTI for a '14 Rubicon. Dan was an excellent salesman but more importantly he cared for the customer. He put my family and I number one in finding the exact vehicle I wanted as well as arranging that the process ran as smooth as silk, which it did. He was friendly, warm, nice, and overall, a very nice person to have as a sales associate both interacting with you on a professional but, more importantly to me, a personal level as well.

Thank you to Dan and the rest of the HBCDJeep Team. I see why this dealership is #1.

Having relocated from Florida to California he was responsive the whole time and was a very knowledgeable no-nonsense type of guy.

by Gene, Betty, Rose, Alondra, Chris & Spirit from Sun City, California | December 5, 2013
We've searched all over Southern California every year, on average, for the past five years. Purchased five vehicles from five different dealers. Until now we have felt scammed, deceived and lied to by car dealers. Buying a vehicle should be an enjoyable experience not a game of deception. Fortunately our need for another vehicle came during the Thanksgiving holiday. Dealers nationwide were having ""pre, during and post Black Friday"" sales. After a week of searching and researching we thought we had a deal with another dealer...... but they kept putting us off. We were getting the run around. We Goggled ""largest Jeep Dealer"" and .....Huntington Beach Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, Ram popped up. The most difficult part of our purchase was picking out the vehicle.......there were over 350 Jeeps to choose from! We found what we wanted (and yes we compared with dealers in San Diego, Riverside, San Bernardino, Los Angeles and Orange Counties, because we were still being cautious with who to trust). I called and spoke to Jim B. mid-evening on Sunday, told Jim our situation, I knew our ""deal"" was a difficult one. Jim was in early the next morning and by the time we called he had us approved for the vehicle we had picked out. ***The other dealer wanted us to ""accept"" a different model/ downgrade. Bottom-line.... Jim B had us in the brand new Jeep, we wanted, in less than 24 hours! JIM....you're amazing, awesome, terrific, wonderful and .... remember this review, we'll be back soon for our daughters vehicle. Next time we won't need to shop around.... we finally found a reputable, straight forward, low pressure organization......Huntington Beach Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, Ram Thank you, Jim!!! And many thanks also, to our finance wizard, Tommy, for making the recommendations he did. We are confident that we made an intelligent purchasing decision and look forward to doing it again soon.",5.0

Finance was able to advise us on several new items and assisted us in understanding every detail without making it an unnecessary lengthy process.  2 cups of coffee later, I had traded-in my Mercedes E350 for a 2014 Jeep Sport.  I love it already. We will continue to buy

615,"November 07, 2013","This was one of the best car buying experience we've ever had. However it was still  two and one half hours (2 1/2). GO FIGURE. We started our search for a 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited, three weeks ago with an internet search. I put a bid in on the vehicle they had in stock with the options we wanted plus a few additional. I was contacted by Gary who had Ron to contact me by internet the next day.

Ron and I discussed the price of the vehicle and he gave me the exact numbers with tax and license out the door. I told him I would shop around and he suggested that I do and promised no one would match the price for this model and if they did he would match their price.

I shopped five dealerships around my area and the closet offer for the exact vehicle was $1,500. dollars more. The other three dealerships claim they could not get the vehicle.

I emailed Ron and told him I would be in Saturday at 9 am to purchase the vehicle. We arrived and Ron and the vehicle was ready to go. There was no surprises or additional cost (as the other dealerships assured me would be because they could not sale the vehicle for that price and the price was a gimmick to get me to the dealership). What a gimmick to sale a vehicle for what you advertised it for. 

We drove 45 miles to the dealership and glade that we did.

When my Tundra was approaching 200K miles, it was time to start looking for a rugged replacement. Big tires to fill. I had checked out the F150's (innattentive salesman, but decent product) and the new Tundras (good salesman, few choices, though) I must say that I was leaning toward another Tundra  until....We (my wife and I) were greeted by Jason Kim at HB CDJ Ram. He let us peruse the trucks on our own, until we were ready to ask questions...nice, even paced sales technique that put us at rest. No confrontation. Absolutely no animousity. Truly professional . I am an unabashed technogeek when it comes to machinery. I was only interested in the V6 FFV with the 8 speed transmission, just a test drive--new technology and all..only a test drive...that's all--- or so i thought.  When it came time to pull a stock # we had selected for a test drive,Jason went to a lot of trouble to get it from out from all the way in the ""back 40"" (40 vehicles,that is). Getting the CrewCab out was no easy task. He explained the features on the model we had selected clearly and concisely and then we drove off. Silently I marveled at the smooth shifting, quiet ride and crisp acceleration put out by the V6 powered Ram. The miserly fuel consumption was a big plus as well. Pretty surprising..alot more than expected. Great presentation..and no babbling sterotype from the sales dept either. Jason is thoughtful and truthful on his answers and not a bit overbearing. Great Salesman! I think he had me sold on the 1500 when I turned around to look at it as I was walking into the office to discuss the deal with Jason...xxxx good looking truck !  ..Truly painless experience.

Jason, the GSM and Crystal with F&I did a great job keeping me pacified..not an easy task..we came to terms quickly and I only crossed my arms a few times.

Oh yeah, LOVE my 2013 Dodge Charger too - it is awesome!  Btw, from what I can see about the people who have posted negative reviews, it looks like they are either (a) first-time car buyers who lack experience with process and won't feel the same way after they have been through it a few times and understand it better, (b) other buyers who have not done enough research yet to understand the market for the car and financing terms, or (c) buyers who are trying to stretch financially into cars they really can't afford (which is okay to try to do, but be professional understand that when the dealership says ""no"" it's not ""shady,"" it's just that you don't meet the bank's underwriting guideliness and you should buy a less expensive car, for now.)  After reading this, I see it looks like I work for a car dealer or have a relative at Huntington Beach, but I swear to god - that's not true - I just buy a lot of cars and know what I am talking about",5.0
659,"May 25, 2013","After finding the exact car and options on the dealer website, I purchased a 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited 4x4.  With the dealers competetive web pricing we were able to work out a deal before I ever set foot in the dealership.  I arrived this morning at 9:30 to complete the purchase, looked over the car, went for a test drive, filled out the financing paper work and was ready to roll in less than 1.5 hours.  Erick was easy to work with and unlike many salesmen was very knowledgable about his product.  Prior to driving off in my new car, Erick walked me through all the features on the car and helped me get the customizable displays, navigation and bluetooth phone connection all working.  This was the best car buying experience I have ever had.",5.0

I easily found the car I wanted online and HBJ prices were not even comparable to any other west coast dealer. I spoke with Jerry, who guided me through the whole process. He was quite knowledgeable about the inventory and genuinely wanted to make sure I got the exact car I wanted...nothing less or more. He is also a pretty funny guy, he got a few laughs out of my sister and that is tough to do. The paperwork was easy and the financing department was extremely expedient, moreover they were even within dollars of the monthly payment I wanted, no negotiating necessary.

I have never seen someone work so hard to get us the EXACT deal we were looking for.  The price we got on the Truck we purchased was unreal, and they gave us what we wanted on our trade in.  The payment came back a little higher than we were expecting, so Howard kept working until he found an interest rate that brought our payment back down to where we could afford it.  We drove 80 miles from Hemet just to work with this dealership.  I have never worked with a more professional and well run dealership.  I recommend this dealership to anyone looking for a vehicle.

671,"May 12, 2013","Another ""Jerry is stellar"" review.  I negotiated with multiple other dealerships and none would even match the price HB Jeep had on their website.  One place went so far as to warn me about HB Jeep. Saying they wouldn't hold an agreed price if I didn't agree to purchase back end products (warranty, gap, alarm, paint protection, etc).  None of that was true.  In fact, it was quite the opposite.  Our price remained the same even though we didn't finance with the dealership or purchase any back end options.  

All around great experience and our next vehicle purchase will be from HB Jeep.",5.0

With previous dealerships, I always felt they were just trying to sell me a car and never felt as though they really cared about what was the right decision for me. I'm a single woman that was looking to lower my car payment in order to save more money to purchase a home. I had called the dealership and spoke to Jerry Fontaine about a used car they had. Jerry answered all of my questions and offered me many different options. He was never pushy and that's what I loved!! He was also great with follow up! I ended up talking to him about a new 2013 Chrysler 200. When I went into the dealership for a test drive, I felt very comfortable and ended up purchasing that vehicle.

I will definitely recommend Jerry to my family and friends!!

676,"May 01, 2013","My name is Carlos R. from Garden Grove. I want to begin by saying that this dealership was extraordinary and would recommend them hands down!! Here is what I went through and what the final outcome of my experience with this dealer from beginning to end. I was in the market for purchasing a new car. So in Feb 2013 I went to HB Jeep to look at 2013 Challenger R/T's. Right from the start a friendly salesperson came to assist me with any questions i had. I managed to look at a few cars, test drove them and discussed features, specs and options. I was sold on this black Challenger R/T. Came in the office to discuss numbers. I told them where I needed to be as far payments and asked what I needed to do in order to get there. All said and done, we closed the deal that same day. I was a happy customer. They agreed to take care of some minor chips and scratches and set up an appointment. I brought the car in to have it taken care of which took about 3 days. Here's where it takes a wrong turn for the worst.

I started to notice that the paint job had some blemishes. I discussed this with the body shop rep and was asked to bring it in. They made the full effort on their end to have this taken care of. After 5-6 times of me bringing the car in to correct this paint defect, they gave up. They decided to have Chrystler Corp informed of the situation. Chrystler opened up a case number and had a representative come down to personally inspect the car. After doing an inspection and consulting with higher management at Chrstler Corp, they decided to buy back my car. Not only did they buy back my car, but also reimburse me for a tint job i had done to it, aftermarket headlight (HID) installed and Mopar sequential tail lights. On top of that, they got me into a brand new 2013 Challenger R/T as a replacement. They transferred my downpayment that originally was used for the first purchase and gave me the same warranty, APR and monthly payments as the original paperwork. 

All this happened in a period of 2 months and they managed to make it a priority to make the customer happy. I can honestly say that I am a happy customer and happy to have made a great choice to purchase my first brand new car from this reputable dealership. Once again, I would strongly recommend this dealer if you want to buy a new car and to have in mind that if something minor or major, like in my case happens, that they will come through and take care of you.

681,"April 13, 2013","If I could say excellent, 25 different ways, I would just type that out. Since that would probably not be very descriptive, I guess, I will elaborate. We worked with Jerry Fontaine for a few days, in a row, over the phone. It was always very friendly and professional without avoiding being human. Most often a salesman reveals his true intentions within the first phone call, but Jerry never made me question his true intention of getting us a great deal and a great vehicle. Unfortunately, Jerry took to a personal issue on the day we were to make our 70 mile trip. I completely understood what he had to make adjustments for, and so he set us up with Chris Piasecki. Chris was just as friendly and personable as Jerry had been. He held our, proverbial, hands through the day, getting us into a car at the stipulated expectations of what was placed upon Jerry's shoulders. Chris never disappointed and even got us into a better finance situation than we had been expecting. Now we know it is not the salesperson who controls those sort of situations, but really those guys are the face of what people, sitting for hours on end, think of when they retrace the experience at any given dealership. By the end of the day we had met several great people, and had been treated just the same as the guy who was buying the 150,000 dollar car. The finance guys we spoke with Johnny and Samir were great and always made sure we understood that everything we had discussed was at our discretion and not a requirement to finalize the deal. We were treated as human beings with a need and we felt very lucky to have chanced upon their advertisement on Autotrader.com. Truly, I would recommend this dealership to any person who is in the market for a vehicle. As we looked around the lot, there were so many great deals we were surprised people were not fighting for vehicles. Then we realized that they were not doing so because their were so many deals that were great, that no one had to fight for their car. I would give Jerry, Chris and Huntington Beach Jeep a 100% without reservation if I had to give it a percent. I literally just got home and went right to the computer so I could pass along their great service asap if anyone just happens to be looking as I type.",5.0

When I arrived, Dan was a very pleasant person to talk to.  He took me out on a test drive and explained about all the features.  I can tell that he was very knowledgeable about the vehicle.  After the test drive, we made a deal.  It was a great deal on the car.  They gave me a fair price on the trade.  And everything was quick.  I got in and out with my new Jeep in under 2 hours.

I bought a 2013 Jeep patriot from Alan Goodall and it was a great experience. He's one of those sales people that would honestly rather see you walk out the door then go home unsatisfied or with the feeling you made a mistake. He spent my entire visit making sure that I was getting what I wanted for a price that suits both of us. It was actually pretty cool, I shook his manager's hand with a price set and he came back after to tell me that it was no good.. and told me they made me a cheaper deal. Overall I would have to say that this was by far my best experience EVER buying a car.

Within the last 7 years I've leased cars from both BMW and Lexus and my most recent visit to Huntington Beach Jeep/Chrystler/Dodge has been, by far, the best experience yet. From the moment we stepped foot on to the lot, we were greeted by a super friendly sales woman named Tess who ended up being extremely helpful while I was trying to decide between cars. My credit score isn't the greatest at the moment so at first I didn't qualify, then the following day I received a call from Tess saying they did everything they could and not only got me approved but got me approved at the terms that we had requested. Then while we were waiting for the paperwork to be written up, rather than leaving us for the ""Take Over"" guy to come finish up the deal, she continued to keep us company and treated us like family -- This was the first time I've given someone a hug after purchasing a car from them.

711,"February 16, 2013","We found a vehicle advertised by this dealership that had all the equipment we wanted and more.  Our situation was unusual in that we were coming in from outside California to buy the new vehicle.  The price as equipped was several thousand dollars less than any other vehicles in our local area, and while we did not make the trip exclusively to buy the vehicle at that price we found that we saved much more than the extra expense of traveling to California and paying the additional taxes and fees involved.

We first asked about the vehicle around a month before our expected travel date.  The salesman and dealer agreed to hold the vehicle, at the advertised price, until we arrived to complete the purchase - certainly a step above average and impressive, considering this dealership sells a high volume of cars and would have a lot of potential customers ready to buy the vehicle.  We greatly appreciate the willingness to work with us and to give us a great deal on just the vehicle we were looking for. - right color, right equipment, best price.

On arrival at the dealership we were greeted by several people.  Our salesman was out on break (we arrived 1/2 hour early) but we were provided a comfortable place to wait and were given free beverages for the duration.  The paperwork took a long time as compared to what we were used to in our home state - that was no fault of the dealership as all documents were based on what is required by the State of California (if you live there, please write your congressperson).  The finance person also did a great job explaining the available protection coverages (extended warranty) and had the DMV paperwork ready to go by the time we made it to her desk.

Talked to dealer the next morning...""No problem-we will take care of you"" well a few days later I did take our jeep in with about 126 miles and the service manager did hear it very clearly and of course our salesman said ""I dont hear anything""and walked away. WOW is that how they that take care of you? We have purchased 3 new jeeps from this sales guy in 2 years!   A 2011 Rubi Unlimited, A 2013 Rubi Unlimited and this 2013 Rubi 2 door.

If the jeep was making that sound when we test drove it NO WAY we would have bought it. So the dealer has turned their backs on us!  WOW!  over  $100,000. we spent there and this is how they """"NO Problem- We will take care of you"""" Please buy from another dealer - no car is made perfect, but this is how they treat a GOOD returning customer. Salesmen- Rob Trachman. and Service Manager is Rick B. I mean these guys really looked me in the eye and said that they would take care of me..........right.

I am sorry that i didn't read every thing in detail but I believe in a small amount of trust between us should be there so we could have a good relationship and they have shown that clearly they do not wish to proceed honestly I DO NOT CARE THAT THE VEHICLE HAS A V6 I am fine with it I do care however when i am told throughout that I have something that I do not. this is what happened to me and i feel cheated.

It started out with being told by my neighbor, whom just purchased a new Dodge Journey that this was the place to go for a great deal. She researched for two days all kinds of dealerships around Southern Ca and found a great deal at Huntington Beach Dodge so she called and got together with Dan Powers( salesman ). Her buying experiance was great she said and she loved the deal so she told me to check them out. I called and spoke to Dan Powers and I couldnt ask for a better Salesman!! He was probebly one of the most respectfull,friendly,salesman I have ever delt with for anything.I felt like I was buying a car from a relative or a friend that was looking out for me. But then When the time came to deal with other people at this establishment I saw that it was'nt just Dan, But everybody I delt with there was the same way. The People I delt with were Dan Powwers, Richard Ambrose, Ross Helman, and Crystal Ott. I have Been told that a gentleman by the name of Rick Evans operates this dealership and my hat's off to this guy for having such a great group of people working there!!! Dan was off at the time of my delivery and he had Richard Abrose take care of the deal. I really enjoyed how thorough and quick he handled us.He made sure we understood everything about the car and my daughter told me in the car when we left how much she liked him. A carbon copy of all the other people I delt with. I would not deal with anybody else except for Huntington Beach Chrysler,Dodge,Jeep,Ram. There is absolutely no reason to go anywhere else.

WOW, I almost didn't buy my Jeep here because of the negative reviews on Yelp.  I'm glad I ignored went ahead with my purchase because everything went off without a hitch.

First of all, I'm a young, small blonde girl....I'm pretty sure I scream ""victim"" when it comes to negotiations but I got this car $4k less than what anyone could offer in NorCal.  It was definitely worth the drive.

1.  Rob Trachtmen, in sales, is great.  I started by asking a few questions by email and then discussed the rest over the phone since I live in San Francisco.  I explained to him that I was worried I would drive down from SF and the specific Liberty I wanted would be sold.  He put it on hold for me and they even took it off the website right away.  When I got there we took it for a drive, it was just as described.  I literally had duct tape holding together parts of my trade-in and I still got $750 for it so I was happy with that.

2. Crystal helped me with the financing.  She's very sweet, it was very straight forward.  I already knew how much I wanted to finance and what I was putting down.  Since I was pre-approved by my bank, I already knew what my APR should be.  Do your homework before you go in and you won't be confused when they lay it all out in front of you.  The only thing I had to decide on at this point, was the extended warranty.  I was unsure about the 7 yr, 100k mile warranty bc I barely drive so she suggested a less expensive, 7 yr, 70k mile warranty which I accepted.",5.0

756,"August 14, 2012","An AMAZING story!!!!

A week ago my family bought a Chrysler Town and Country. It was a great van and great experience. 

We bought the van for the purpose of converting it to accommodate my son who is in a wheelchair. Two days after buying the van, tragically my Son passed away.

So here we were with a van that was too big for our now very small family with payments that would not be affordable. We called the dealer a day later to see what they would be able to do. (If anything) 

We talked to Ross Helman, the Executive Sales Manager. He was amazing. Extremely compassionate and sensitive to our situation. He offered to unwind the deal and return all the cash that we had paid with no obligation to buy another vehicle from them. Incredible!

Well I still needed a car, just one more affordable. They let me look around by myself and pick something else that I was interested in. I came back, they applied all the same financing and discounts I had negotiated for on the last car. Ross helped me get to a manageable payment. Erick, from sales helped the paperwork go easily and quickly, no pressure for anything treating things as sensitively as possible and Samir, one of the finance guys got things finished off without trying to push any of those things that finance guys usually do. They were all extremely compassionate and sensitive to the situation. I dreaded the thought, the day before my Son's funeral services, having to walk in and negotiate for another vehicle. They made things so easy.

The bottom line is that the Dealership stepped up and did the right thing. So hard to find these days in the crazy world of business, especially the car business. They could have made me keep the van and it would have been at no fault of their own. They didn't and really helped me out. For that I can see why I will be loyal to them for a long time to come. Thanks Russ for really helping us out. Amazing!!!! ",5.0

He was relaxed, upfront and honest with us from the very beginning about price, which was the best priced, and most compelling for my husband and I.

My husband talked to Greg on and off the day before Greg sent usan email to guarantee the price, we arrived early the next morning with a cashiers check for he exact amount. The car was waiting for us.  They never pressured us Toby anything extra, changed up the price by hidden costs or anything, they did exactly what they said they would do, they were even open to allowing us different colors of the same car for the same price if we so desired.  All staff was friendly, we were in and out in about an hour, which is amazing as to how long friends of mine have been at a dealership to buy a car.

787,"April 27, 2012","I had been casually shopping for anew Jeep Grand Cherokee since they came out with the new body style at the end of 2010. I decided to get serious about 3 months ago and visited some local dealers where I live in the central Valley. No one could come close to the price offered by these guys. Dealers in the valley were offended at the prices I offered for cars they had in stock while Mike (great guy to work with and highly recommended) was able to custom order me a vehicle for the same price. 

Local dealers told me the only way that Huntington could offer such low prices was to sneak in extra fees and give you a ""hard sell"" on warranties and other profitable items. It could not have been farther from the truth, they gave me a very clear itemized list of all my fees and the only extra fee was a $55 doc fee which is standard at every dealer I visited (I did see one dealer that wanted a $250 doc fee so watch out). As far as a hard sell, they simply offered me my options and when I declined that was the end of it, very low pressure and nice guys.

Because I was coming in from out of town Mike drove in from his house to meet me at the dealer when it was convenient for me, he even offered to pick me up at the local airport. I couldn't have imagined a smoother transaction or working with a more professional individual than Mike S and everyone else at this dealership.

The bottom line is that if you're looking for a Chrysler or Jeep product, and a great price and easy transaction are the most important things to you then these are the guys you want to be doing business with.

After doing research online, I decided that I wanted a Jeep and that Huntington Beach had the best deals. I went down to the dealership and test drove the car I saw online and fell in love. We went into the sales office, crunched some numbers and (due to my credit being way lower than I thought it was) found that the monthly payments for the car I wanted were about $100 more than I could afford to pay. After extensive checks and rechecks they couldn't get it to a number I was comfortable with so I was forced to walk away. However, I barely got out of my seat when the manager said he would make it work for $5 less a month then I had told him I would pay. I shook his hand and the deal was made. I never once felt any pressure or like I was being forced to buy anything. Every time I said ""no"", Richard went back to financing to ""see what he could do"" until he finally brought the manager over to get me the best deal possible.

It actually had information online about the vehicles (photos, rebate info, invoices and stickers). I first stopped by the dealership a month before I purchased my Jeep at this dealership. Erick was very personable and friendly. I didn't feel like he was pressuring me to make a purchase. He was the reason I ended up going back and started getting serious about a new vehicle. After that first visit I did call back to the dealership and ended up speaking with someone else, first name of Chris. That interaction left a bad taste with me. I would have gone to a different dealership if I had to continue the deal with that person. The interaction with the dealership at first was touch and go. I showed interest and wanted to trade in my vehicle. Edmunds.com showed a vehicle of the year I owned and in the condition with the low miles and options should be around $5600 trade in (not resale value). The first offer from the dealership was at $3500. After I called back, the same day the next offer was $4000. I felt like I was paying for this ""internet discount"" that the website had by them lowering the value of my trade in. When I was able to finally make a deal I was happy with, the dealer ship came up on the trade in to $5000. I felt this was fair and I was comfortable with the deal. If it hadn't been for Erick being friendly and helpful I don't think I would have continued with the process. I would have just kept the car another year.

806,"February 27, 2012","I was in the market for a 2012 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Sahara. After checking all of the local dealership's websites, HB Jeep had the lowest sale price. I called to confirm the price and inventory to make sure it wasn't a bait & switch. One of the discounts being applied to the sales price was for military only, of which I'm not, so that got added back to the price. However, even after adding back that discount, they still had the best price in South Orange County. I never felt that my salesperson, Semir, was being pushy or applying any pressure. It was more like he was just showing off stuff he had; if I liked it great; if not, no worries. Before I select which one I wanted, they had already made me an offer on my trade in, which was KBB full value for the condition my old car was in. After picking the Jeep I wanted, I then dealt with Mike in their financing department. Mike was very easy going; probably because Jeep was offering 0% APR for 36 months, so there wasn't much to figure out. He did his usual of offering a few up-sells, pricing them in both cost and payment. I picked what I wanted and spent about 20 minutes on paperwork. When that was done, I went to pick up my new baby, and they had a guy from their shop (didn't catch his name) spend another 30 minutes or so walking me through every button and feature. I thought that was a great touch! All told, I was in and out in less than 3 hours, got a fair price for my trade in, and a great price for a new Jeep. I was thoroughly pleased.

I talked to Chris on the phone before I came to the dealership, just to confirm the great price they had advertized on the internet. The price was real, so I went down there. Chris was busy with another customer when I got there, so he had Ron show me the new Liberty I had talked to him about. Ron took me for the test drive, and showed me all the features. He was very informative, and obviously knew the vehicle inside and out.

The third person I had to deal with was not as fun. They sent another person to set up the deal we me (trade-in, payments, etc.). In short, after three hours of negotiating (which I thought was totally un-needed), we agreed on the trade value of my vehicle, which was within a stones throw of Keley Blue Book, maybe even a bit better than I was hoping, since you never really get what KBB's value is. It would have been much easier if they would have made a realistic offer from the start. I guess that's where they try to make up for those low prices they offer.

All ended well, and I am a happy customer. My only suggestion is if you do go there with a trade, print out your KBB value, and if possible, get a written quote from Carmax, it may save you alot of time. The prices they list on the internet are real, and they never tried to ""adjust"" them at any point in the deal, great prices. I would deal with Chris or Ron again without question, they are good people.

I found the best price in SoCal for this car which was fully loaded with all options on their website. I thought the price was too good to be true, and I live 50 miles away, the last thing i wanted after driving an hour and a half with traffic is to find out the price was a bait and switch, or they didn't have the car they advertised. This was NOT the case. From my first call to Bill to inquire about the car, he confirmed the price advertised was what the car was to be sold as. No haggling, ZERO pressure to buy. As I said the price was too good to be true, 7K less than every other dealer in my area, so I was waiting for deal to get ""upsold"" or have hidden fees like VIN etching, or dealer prep fees.. But nothing like that ever happened, every thing was very transparent in the deal, and all questions where answered, with out any pressure to upgrade to other features like extended warrantees.

We arrived at this dealership and Dan Powers greeted us right away and hurried along to find us the exact car we were looking for. We had already had a test drive at the dealership so we went right into his office to work out a deal to trade our car in for. The team or ""cast"" (as Dan calls them) worked very efficiently to get us a great deal in the price range we were looking for. Dan was so nice and engaged us in good conversation the whole time. Of course (as anyone who buys a car knows) buying a car takes a bit of time to work out but Dan and staff made time fly. Dan was very thorough and made sure we knew about all the cool features of our new car. They also made no fuss over our two young children getting restless & running havoc.

We had been looking for months at the local dealers but kept getting the same price offered to us, which we weren't willing to pay (whats up with that San Diego?).  On a whim, I checked online within a 200 mile radius and Huntington Beach Chrysler popped up with some crazy good deals. I asked a salesman in San Diego if they could match the prices and they said that there was no way those prices were legit and they didn't want me to drive up to Huntington Beach and ""get my feelings hurt"".  So I called to see how real these deals were and talked to Jason.  He was great!  Seriously, take it from a mom and someone who has a tendency to have anxiety of big purchases, just ask directly for him because he made it so stress free.  Well, should I say, he will for you, I did stress because I was waiting for the deal to fall through or him to change it up on us but really, he was a straight shooter, I should have trusted my gut and not worried... but I did.  Jason treated me like a person who had some brains and didn't try to pull any of that stereotypical car salesman stuff with me (for example, not once did he call me ""sweetheart"", and once I told him exactly what I wanted he didn't push me to get something else).  Anyway, he gave me an awesome price over the phone (we are talking A LOT less than San Diego here), and I drove up the next day and did the paperwork at that price, not once did he try to change it.

The only reason that I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the length of the wait once the paperwork was done.  It really shouldn't take more than 45 minutes or even an hour and a half to clean a car and pull it around.  We were there a total of 3 hours with two kids under 4 and I don't think that was necessary.   I think the finance guys were trying to hook us on the extended warranty thing that we had declined because they came out of the office and brought it up again after everything was signed.

I had such high hopes for this dealership. Nice website, responded to my e-mail inquiry, etc, etc.  Not so!

Came on the lot with a 2002 Range Rover ready to trade.  My buddy and I got onto the lot where two saleman actually saw us and turned the other way.  We were to meet a salesman who does their internet sales who I can only describe as a scrawney pale Martin Short look-a-like with too much mouse in his hair making him look like ""The Heat Miser"" from that old Christmas show.  But I digress.

We came in our casual t-shirt and jeans and they treated us like dirt which is funny because we both work in the film industry (Director and Photographer respectively) and I plan on telling everyone I know to stay away from this dealership.  Simply rude and they assumed we were dumb enough to fall for their ""very slick"" sales techniques.  

Tried to sell us a car with a damaged front and rear and all they said was ""so do you want to buy it?""  Yeah buddy, I want to by your damaged goods and pay WAY over Blue Book.  They forget they're selling a Jeep, not a Lexus.

The Internet sales guy didn't even take the time to show us the car.  He pawned us off to what I can only describe as ""Cousin It's"" moronic brother who kept calling us ""bro' and drilled me with so many questions that I finally had to tell him to be quiet so I could listen to the ""clicking sound"" the car made as I drove it.

When i wanted to see any other inventory, they took us ""out back"" and showed us a Grand Cherokee that was not only filthy but looked like it had been caught in a flood.  I laughed until my buddy pointed to the License Plate on the car and it was from ""Louisiana"".  Katrina Salvage anyone?

I have to say, once we were going to walk off the lot, the ""original"" sales guy ran out and tried to wheel and deal, but by then I was so disgusted we politely excused ourselves and left.  Later we looked at each other and thought, here was a great example of why car dealers get such a bad rap.  The type of place that makes you want to take a shower afterwards.

I understand people have to make a living and people need to sell, but you don't have to be a jerk about it.  There are too many other dealerships that you don't have to subject yourself to the indignity of one like Huntington Beach Jeep.  Yeah guys, your ""Monkey in the Trunk"" logo fits you perfectly!

I just want to warn others who may think this place looks great on the surface as I did, only to be thoroughly disappointed.",1.3
822,"August 02, 2005","I went to this dealership last year, in order to start shopping around for a PT Cruiser. I had told them what I was willing to pay, we talked about monthly figures--and they said they would shop a loan for me and then we could discuss the final costs. I made it clear that I was NOT applying for one yet, but gave them my information, so they could do the credit check in order to get interest rates.

well, I get this call that said, ""Congratulations, we found you a loan, you can pick up your car!"" I said ""what? You were just supposed to be getting me figures!"" Of course, the figure was too high, and by then I was most unhappy that they had secured a loan without my permission. I told them the deal was off (I had not signed any papers) and drove my old car for another year, I was so scarred by my experience. I did eventually buy my PT Cruiser, but not from this dealer!",1.8
