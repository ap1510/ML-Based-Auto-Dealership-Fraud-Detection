He was telling us about a 6 month no intrest plan to come up with the down payment. He was very informative and nice. We met with a manager as well Bill he was very nice and informative as well. The car I wanted to get they wanted more down once they found that out they were already looking for a different car with less of a down payment. They found the perfect car windows were already tinted it had nice wheels and also push to start which I love. Once we went to finance we met with Kal.

356,"August 04, 2017","I am writing to express my gratitude for the great service I received at Bill Wright from Marcus Markham in Bakersfield, CA. He responded to my request quickly and professionally. When I explained to him the terrible tragedy my daughter in law was in (DUI) he expressed such compassion and sensitivity. I had expressed my needs to purchase the 2015 Scion XB and that I would like to know about other warranty options. He responded to me quickly and he provided a quote for me with 2 options. I explained to him that I didn't need financing and he didn't try to pursue me otherwise. He wasn't pushy or impersonal. I explained that my kids has endured enough tragedy by my daughter in law enduring a fractured ankle, broken leg. fractured pelvis, cracked rib and fractured collarbone along with our 3 month old grandson who endure bruising. They are both a miracle and if it wasn't for the donations of the televised story and family we would be without a vehicle on top of lost wages/time. This whole experience has changed my idea of a car sales man because he treated me like family and not like a number. Please recognize Marcus Markham for Customer Service Excellence.

357,"July 19, 2017","My visit was quick and exceeded expectations. It was a hot day and my salesman, Tom, was quick to offer me cool water which I appreciate in a heat spell such as this. I felt it reflected well on the brand and the dealership that I felt taken care of before I committed to anything. I wasn't offered a water at Honda and had to ask where the refreshments were. 

As far as the sale went, I was highly satisfied with the quick and easy nature at the end of my previous lease. I was able to get a new vehicle (in the color I wanted even) with toyotacare and gap coverage within three hours at a lower payment than I expected. I got the vehicle I wanted and avoided a costly end lease process many of my friends who leased through other dealers had warned me about. ""Haha they got me for two grand at Chevy and a detailing fee too, you'll see Joe!"" ""haha I can't believe you didn't get a Honda, they only charged me a grand to get into last years stick shift civic in a strange color you'll see.""

Well it looks like I'll get to have the last laugh when I pull up in my blizzard pearl white Corolla SE blasting darude's ""sandstorm"" from my standard(!) Bluetooth stereo. I'll give them a ride to the bank and chuckle when they view my bank account. I'm prepared to bring a yardstick to measure the distance their jaws drop when they can't find any toyota service charges or miscellaneous fees. I enjoyed my truly exceptional service at Toyota and will remain a life long customer. ",5.0

564,"June 14, 2014",Im not a person who likes to argue but today w the service I reseaved....just to get the car ditaiel makes me think if we did the right decision by going Toyota. We Had great service the night of purchasing. If u want happy customers be organied n professional. I waited in the lobby for 4hrs w my 2month old pasiently knowing that it was busy n I dint get called that my car was ready. If i wouldnt of asked they probably wouldn't of called me. That's disappointing. ,2.2
565,"April 28, 2014","After purchasing two cars and a long standing great relationship, the sales and finance department failed miserably to follow through on salient assurances on which the lease was based. Because of great treatment before, I was  prone to accept verbal assurances. That will never happen again.",2.2
566,"February 02, 2014","I was treated horribly by Jess Winters. What ever you do stay away from her at all possible costs!!! She was the single WORST salesperson I have EVER dealt with. She did not know Toyota's incentive programs and said that since I was in Fresno she was in interested in selling me a car since I was ""outside her market area"" Really??!?! My home town is Bakersfield and I am in Fresno for school. Seriously, the worst experience ever! Take your money somewhere else.",1.0
567,"April 26, 2013","I've purchased several vehicles over the last several years.  I am currently driving a Prius and love the service that I received at Bill Wright recently.  I made an appointment, however, I arrived early.  Beau Shepherd helped me out and arranged for a shuttle.  He had my vehicle serviced, washed and ready to go before I was ready to come back and pick it up.  Thanks Beau!",5.0
568,"March 20, 2009","I initially purchased a silver 2006 Toyota Tacoma 4x4 (2.7L) truck from Bill Wright Toyota, which got turned in due to the lemon law act for an unfixable front end problem. The replacement truck (a white 2006 Toyota Tacoma 4x4 SR5), had shifting problems and poor suspension issues from the start. Multiple complaints from me yieled no help on either problem. Instead, I got the standard reply of, ""The truck is working normal."" So, out of my own pocket I upgraded the shocks ($800+ dollars), only to find out of a rear spring and shock TSB issued by Toyota. After much lobbying, I finally got approval for this work to be done - which helped my suspension problem. However, I was out the $800+ dollars for the shocks. In the course of installing the rear springs, the tech inproperly installed the differential (wrong geometry), and this took out my driveshaft carrier bearing. I made multiple attempts complaining of driveline noise and vibration with the standard answer of, (you guessed it), "" That's normal driveline noise."" Took the truck to a driveline service center that found the chewed-up carrier bearing, the wrong geometry and a bent left rear axle. I guess, according to Toyota, this is all normal. Another Toyota dealership even gave me the same B.S. about the noise (Sierra Toyota). I'm now out over $1000 in repair of the axle, driveshaft and differential alignment.

As far as the shifting problems, I had the clutch pedal TSB preformed with little help to the crappy shifting of this truck. Funny, the first truck (the silver one) didn't have this problem. Along with the poor shifting, at 50K miles the clutch started slipping when I would go into 4WD. Again, disgusted with the non-service of the dealership (and Toyota corporate), I'm in the process of replacing the clutch with an aftermarket (Clutch Masters Stage 1) clutch using a transmission shop to install it. They suspect (based on experience) that the stock pressure plate is inferior (as seen on other Tacomas), and think that it isn't holding and engaging the clutch disc properly. This effort will cost me a total of $1100.  I'm hoping that the syncros aren't worn now...

There are (other) little issues, not addressed by this dealship on this truck, but these two mentioned problems stand out. I will NEVER own another Toyota vehicle ever again. And if this truck wasn't paid off, I'd be driving something else.",2.0
569,"February 21, 2009","Desperately needed new Tires before going over a snowbound grapevine, dropped into Bill Wright w/ No Apt. Service Rep was Quick, Friendly and Helpful. Needed 2 tires plus Oil Change. We waited comfortably in lounge. Kids loved the play room, but we were ready to go in about an hour. Thanks Bill Wright Toyota",5.0

I have owned eight Toyota‚Äôs in the past fifteen year‚Äôs; with the most resent being a 2006, 2005, 2002, etc. I‚Äôm personally selling my new Toyota because I refuse to take my vehicle back to the dealer, Bill Wright Toyota!
