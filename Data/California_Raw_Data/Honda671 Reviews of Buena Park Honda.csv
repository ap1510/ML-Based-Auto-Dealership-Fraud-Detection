87,"February 09, 2020","This dealership is amazing. 3 years ago I had leased my first Honda Civic. THAT experience was amazing. I was new to the car buying experience and they made it easy for me. Now, when it came time to end my lease and return my vehicle, I had preemptively stopped in and spoke to Tigran about my options. My situation was unique in that right before my lease was ending, I had to have repairs done to my vehicle. Tigran gave me the advice that would best suit ME, the customer. I got his contact information because I knew that when the repairs were done, I wanted to go back and work with Tig, and Tig only. 

Yesterday, I had my leased vehicle back and contacted Tig to set up the appointment. He greeted me with the same level of service and enthusiasm that he showed me previously. This time, I was no longer going to lease a vehicle, it was time to purchase one. Tig made this process so easy for me. We found the car I wanted, and he fought to get the terms where they needed to be in order to drive away in the car I wanted!

Thanks Tig and Buena Park Honda. You have a lifelong customer in me!

My only issue is that it took an hour and a half after 20 minutes of my scheduled appointment, so almost 2 hours hours. I didnt know I had to wait that long until my car was already being serviced.  It would have been nice to know when I made the appointment about how long it would take (they should have an idea of how long routine service maintenance takes).

122,"November 27, 2019","The process was pretty straight forward to set the appointment on the phone. They opened up promptly at 7am and had me checked in by 7:10am. I was a little surprised to see my truck parked in a lot in back at 7:30 so they didn't start working on it immediately. They were done with the service by 8:45 which is good but not stellar, considering it was just an oil change and tire rotation. I was surprised that Honda charges you for the first service, as Toyota gives you free oil changes for the first 36k miles. That is not the dealer's fault, that would be on Honda as a company. There really isn't any incentive to bring it to the dealer when you can go get the same price from Big O in half the time. The service writer was very polite and professional as were the rest of the employees. I'm not a big fan of the new policy to not wash cars to be ""eco friendly"". I see it as a way to save money. It makes you feel better to pick up a clean car. As far as dealers go, this one does a good job across the board. This is my first Honda and I have to say that we have a BMW and a Toyota, both received the first services free of charge.",4.2

166,"September 20, 2019","This was the first time i had to take my car in for service. I called in was able to get a quick, same-day appointment. Once I got there, I was helped right away. Overall, I felt like I was not given all the information or explained about the services being done. The service consultant told me that I had to get an alignment since they had put in new brakes when I first bought the car last year. I agreed for them to do so because she mentioned a discount they had on alignments even though I was only coming in for an oil change. When I asked about possibly getting an exterior car wash, the service consultant rejected it by pointing out the signs that said they were temporarily halting the car wash. She explained it was due to needing to upgrade it to be in compliance with city codes. I was given a time frame of about 2 and a half hours. She called back later to say I needed to have additional service done that would double the cost I had expected. After first accepting it under pressure of having to make a decision in that moment, I called back to decline the service. Each time she told me I needed additional service, she didn't give me a time frame or explain how urgent it was. That's why I declined the second time. The oil change and alignment were completed in a good amount of time (roughly 2 and a half hours) so I was glad I wasn't going to be late to my afternoon events. At the end of the night, however, the car notified me that I have to check my tire pressure. This was something that was noted ""Satisfactory"" and set to 35 psi on the service receipts. Needless to say, I am upset that I will have to take care of this on my own when it was marked off as being checked at the time of service. After comparing prices with others, I'm not sure I would personally return to this dealership; nonetheless, I would still recommend it to someone else. ",3.0

We were also promised a second key and have not heard back from this dealership. After you make your purchase don't expect to be taken care of by them.

209,"April 26, 2019","The service provider I worked with is Tony Lagos at Buena Park Dealer.  He is the typical service person insisting the customer has to ""listen"" to him by feeding me the information I disagree.   He didn't listen to me despite I kept telling him ""I got your point"".   I later open the case#09517955 with Honda HQ and adopted the right information in regarding to my new car manufacture warranty.  I'm not sure if Buena Park is the dealer to train him this way or so.  However, I confronted a very unprofessional services.  He speak a loop of story repeatedly to confuse me and embarrassed me in the public by implication of ""not listening to him"".  

I bought my Dec/2017 Civic LX with only 6.7K mileage thru House of Import and found the storage tray between the front seats was loosing and brought to Honda dealer to evaluate if caused by ""defected"".   With my car warranty within 11K mileage, I believe it should still be in ""manufacture warranty"" which I later learned from Honda HQ also called ""New Car Warranty"".  Tony told me there would be a different standard to evaluate this used car if the car was purchased thru 3rd party.  I simply disagreed.  There is only one standard in my ""manufacturing contract"" with Honda which is whatever the damage caused naturally thru ""defected"" or ""improper used outside force"" should have stated in the ""manufacture contract"" for conduction.  The only one standard to compliant is in my contract.   If the damage from improper used outside force, the dealer just have to give reasonable statement of investigation for consumer to decide further whether to fix it from out of pocket or leave it as ease.   Therefore, it's very difficult for me to understand what is he trying to fulfill by telling me those irrelevant things.   We haven't even got into investigation result yet and the manufacturing warranty is stated clearly be transferable.

309,"September 24, 2018","All dealership service departments are busy - all of the time.  
I was having several problems with my 2014 Honda Accord recently.  Trans shifting was jerky and at times slipped and hesitated.  Also my radar warning started reporting a problem.  Then my radio and navigation would just reboot on it's own while driving.
Last Friday the trans was acting up again while I was backing into a parking place.  I headed straight to the Buena Park Honda.  It was almost 5 pm when I walked in without an appointment.  I walked up to Gio's desk and waited patiently while he was working on his computer.  I went to him because he had assisted me previously with oil changes and a valve cover gasket leak repair.  
He stopped to acknowledge me (although I'm positive he didn't remember me) and let me know that he would be right with me as soon as he finished what he was working on.  Two minutes later he was taking my information and listening to my auto issues.  I left the car there and my wife came and picked me up.
By Saturday morning Gio was calling me to let me know that they determined all of my problems were related to a loose battery connection.  Everything is controlled by computers, the trans shifting included.  Apparently stopping motion and then accelerating was causing my battery connection to move enough to affect the cars computers.  They were going to return my car to me at no charge. I ended up getting other maintenance services that needed to be done anyway, but I still got my car back that Saturday.
My point is that the server reps are always on the move, meeting you at the car or entering orders.  Even without an appointment, I was greeted courteously, acknowledged and being helped within a few minutes of my arrival.   And on a Friday afternoon too.  
They kept me informed with text messages and a phone call to explain the fix, and offer recommended services needs.  Yes it was a simple fix for them, and the car is running great so far. 
I've taken my car to B.P. Honda whenever it needs maintenance because they have always taken good care of me and my car.  I've used the shuttle service to take me home when I've needed to leave my car too.

He was very knowledgeable and also surprised that he was a Honda tech and mechanic for some years now.

I met with Hugo and he looked deeper into the situation and had his mechanics even call their support team to figure out the problem. We found out it was the body control module and luckily my vehicle was still on the warranty. Hugo helped me out by not finishing my paperwork and had me come in the next day because I had to order the part. When I came in he dispatched my vehicle and they took it back right away and I was informed it would take a couple hours, which it did. They even gave me a complementary wash and Hugo was in contact with me the whole time they were working on my vehicle. If I had any questions all I had to do was just go talk to him.

337,"August 13, 2018","I don't take pride in giving 1 star reviews, and seldom do, but Buena Park Honda, you deserve this one star review!!  Absolute TERRIBLE.... I repeat TERRIBLE experience!  Bait and switch is in full effect.  EXCESSIVE wait for finance and delivery... and thats not the bad part!

I drive my 18 Ridgeline with 63 miles on the odometer home from the dealership.  On my way, I make one stop before arriving home.  I push the ignition button to turn off the engine and the battery dies... like 6 feet under dead!.  So, I wait an hour for AAA to arrive for assistance.  They run a diagnostic that confirms the battery is the problem and not the alternator.  They jump start me.  I drive around (as if the 30 minute drive home was not long enough) and try to back into my parking space.  The truck lurches and jerks both in steering and transmission to the point that I did not feel comfortable risking body or property damage parking in the garage, so I put in on the street.

The next morning, I go out at 8:30am to start up the Ridgeline and... drum roll please... the battery is dead again... I get a second jumpstart and let it run for an hour while attempting to call the dealership about this problem.  From 10:00am until 10:15am I could not reach ANYONE... NO ONE in sales, NO ONE at reception.  Frustrated with trying to reach the dealership, I decide I would drive back but just after a few minutes on the road, I have alarm chimes going off and icons displayed in the data info area on the dash.  Deciding that a 25 mile trip in 90 degree heat was not wise, I took this brand new Ridgeline with less than 100 miles to a Firestone facility I have used in the past.  They do an assessment and I'm buying a new battery to the tune of $207 for a brand new vehicle I have had for 16 hours!

I just spent north of $30,000 for a brand new vehicle .  While I hate to sound ""entitled"" the dealership should take 100% ownership for this issue and make additional compensatory steps necessary, because as of right now, NO ONE at Buena Park Honda is helpful!

I am so, so VERY ready for my survey from Honda.  I can truly say, that this is my 15th Honda product and as of right now, it will be the last.",1.6

371,"June 20, 2018","I went in for an oil change last month. Making the online appointment was extremely easy and convenient. When I arrived I did not anticipate a 45 minute wait just to check in. As usual, they ring you up and suggest what services my vehicle needed or did not need at the moment. I have never felt that any services were pushed just to make business. This is why I like coming to Buena Park Honda. My car had a few recalls that they had to take care of which prolonged the time of delivery of my vehicle, which I totally anticipated. They offered a free shuttle service in the morning and I was able to get some things done around my house. The shuttle service in the afternoon was not promised so I just Lyfted back to the dealership for a small cost. My car was delivered as promised and everyone I came into contact in the service department was amazing and pleasant to speak to. The only issue I had was the long wait at check in. I want to give BP Honda another chance because I noticed that everyone was mostly new. The time delay was the only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars. ",4.8

I thought they every time check up all of my car.
Because every time they recommended to replace. 
I usually replaced them according to their recommendations.
I trusted 100% for service advisor and their system.

Last Monday(May 14), I heard strange sound around brake so I visited here.

The service advisor said I had a problem with the disk because I didn`t replace the brake pads.

I couldn`t believe that. I repaired last January but The service advisor didn`t recommend about brake pads. 

The service advisor said other service advisor recommended to replace on Aug but I refused.

However I visited three times after I refused to replace brake pads.

I checked all of report when I got from Honda.

On Aug, Front brake pads level was 3 and checked red.
On Nov, Front brake pads level was 4 and checked green.

what happen?

I CAN NOT TRUST YOUR REPORT.

I was sacrificed by your mistakes so repaired my car with an unreasonably high repair cost.

Last Wednesday(May 16), the warning light came on and I visited again.

I was very uncomfortable and upset for service advisor "" Martinez Joanna"".

She said that if they inspect my car and find some problem, we have to pay more than $ 100

445,"January 30, 2018","I've just had the second of my two Hondas serviced by Buena Park Honda and am now convinced that moving my business from the other local Honda dealership is the best move I can make.  I've always looked after my vehicles extremely well and although both my S2000 and Element are more than 10 years old they are both in immaculate condition.  It was heartening to see this was noticed immediately by Jaime G the Service advisor and by the technician who took the vehicle into the service bays.

Jaime scheduled my service appointment over the phone, met me when I arrived at Buena Park Honda and went out of his way to ensure the cost of the service was even a little lower than I expected.  He also managed to get answers to a couple of questions I had about the S2000 which were never answered by the Dealership I used to visit.

I would highly recommend Buena Park Honda to any owner who treasures their Honda as much as I do.   ",5.0

Maybe there was a sign I missed, but I left my car and waited inside for a few minutes before anyone acknowledged me. Then when I finally got help, I was told that I was supposed to wait outside in my car for a service person. That would have been fine. I just felt like it was something I was supposed to know, so I was a bit annoyed. But Alvin made up for it when he came out. I dropped it off and got a ride home from a neighbor, so they not only changed the oil, but gave it a wash, which was an unexpected surprise. And Alvin was also great when I came to pick it up.

475,"December 19, 2017","My experience at Buena Park Honda was so SUPERB that I had to take some time out of my day to write an excellent review! From the initial contact that I had via email to the final purchase and follow up, every bit of my experience was amazing. My first communication with this dealership was via email. I communicated with Tony Huynh and he was an excellent sales person. He was able to successfully negotiate a price match on the vehicle I wanted with his management team. He remained professional and never pushy throughout the entire email correspondence. When I arrived at the dealership to purchase the vehicle, Tony was with another client, but he asked his colleague John Buhs to step in and assist. JOHN WAS AMAZING! (Honestly, amazing doesn't even describe John). He literally treated me like family, but remained professional. John ensured that the vehicle was in top notch condition before I drove off the lot. He spent nearly 5 hours with me and not once did he seem impatient or irritated with the amount of time I was taking in making my final decisions. Lastly, I wanted to acknowledge Michelle Padilla. She was so friendly and helpful in finalizing the paperwork for my vehicle. She wasn't pushy when it came to adding on additional features, but her honesty and patience actually resulted in me adding a 6 year maintenance plan to my purchase. The experience at this dealership exceeded my expectations. This was the first time in my life that I purchased vehicle without having my father present with me at the dealership. As a young woman, I was very nervous doing so, knowing some of the stereotypes of car salesmen and car dealerships, but I didn't feel pressured or taken advantage of at Buena Park Honda. If I or a family member/friend is ever in the market to buy a Honda, I am sending them to Buena Park Honda and referring them directly to John Buhs.

I had had the car serviced in June in preparation for a long driving trip and some of the 35,000 mile maintenance service was done then, according to my service record.  Jaime accurately predicted the amount of time (2 hours) and estimated the cost for the service.  My husband was with me and we were also purchasing a car, which took us 5 hours to complete so Jaime waited patiently before letting us know that our Accord was ready.  While checking the car in, Jaime and I discovered that we were both interested in art, he does acrylic painting and I'm a watercolorist.  He showed me a photo on his cell phone of a Halloween project that he and his daughter/son (?I can't remember which) had completed and it was terrific!  The one thing he did forget when it came time for me to pay for the service, was to deduct the coupon I had brought in that shaved off $65 from the total price of the service, and he needed to be reminded.  He apologized and ran the paperwork through to correct the error.

Now this is why I like Buena Park Honda and why I am going to go back. The day that I left a customer service from BP Honda texted me and asked how my visit was AND i got a email from BP Honda asking if I had any complaints. The person who texted me is named Eddie, and he was very nice and took time to hear me out and told me what I can do so that they can know what they need to fix/replace. Eddie is the man not only because hes was nice but took me to the body shop to show me what was wrong, what i needed to fix, and what options he has for me and man he has his customer service ON POINT. Usually when I see dealers and body shops I go in and tell them what I think or know is wrong and they just try to do it fast and get my money, and I dont even know what they did to fix it until they are done.

There were many open slots available, even on a Saturday. However, even with a reservation, we still had to wait to drop the car off. The checkin was quick, but we had to wait for a service advisor to be assigned to us (Giovanni). The wait was about 15 minutes. After explaining the problem with the car, the advisor told us a rough estimate of how long it would take to have the mechanic investigate & possibly fix the problem, if parts were available. The estimate was pretty close, we were told about 1.5 hours, it was 2 hours when we got the call to come pick the car up. The checkout by the same service advisor was quick & we were picking up our car, freshly washed.

Here is my review about Rude and worst  customer service experience. On Sunday June 11, 2017 I called  Buena Park Honda dealership to lease a New 2017 Honda Odyssey Mini Van.  Spoke to Internet Sales person named Patrick . I gave him my requirements and informed him my down payment and the monthly payment . I informed the sales person about the quote I received from Hardin Honda and also informed him that they do not have the EX-L model which I am looking for.  Finally I said let me drive to your dealership from Riverside County and you find me a good deal since you guys have several of these models in stock. While I was driving he texted me a down payment and monthly payment  but I responded that I  am driving towards your dealership so just check EX-L without RES for me.  But he texted me again a quote while I was driving so I could not respond due to safety and reached the dealership. Here comes the worst part................ I was with my wife who wears modest dress and wears a head scarf, So this sales person came up to us, looked at us and with no smile on his face   without saying Hi ,he said ""which one should I grab,silver or White"" , hmmmmmmm  I said can I talk to you about the final numbers before you pull the van , he said ""Why did you show up if you didn't agree with the  numbers"" I told him it was your quote not a final number. He became further rude and angry and left  to his room,left us wondering if he will come back, he came back with the quote copy and said here are the numbers I texted you. I said can we sit and talk and he said , nope that is the number and I cannot talk any further. Then I said can  you talk to your Desk manager and see if you can give some discount in down payment and he said ""nope"". I asked can I get a copy of the quote and he said ""Nope"" . In my observation it seems like this person need a major sales training to learn how to deal with the Intercultural customers. He seems like someone who  judged us based on my wife's dress and our demeanor.  My comment is not about the deal or the numbers, it is how the sales person changed his tone and attitude when he saw me and my wife. I suggest these type of sales persons must be either removed or retrained from the dealership. The sad part is this dealership is part of Sonic Automotive group and I am not sure how he is working here without going through a training to work with diverse culture and working with people of color. 
Just so you know, while my way home I stopped by at Weir Canyon Honda and received an excellent service and leased my 2017 Odyssey within an hour. I am not here to advertise any other dealership but I want to make all my fellow Americans know to stay away from the fake reviewed dealerships on yelp or other review sites as my personal experience was the worst at Buena Park Honda.

666,"April 20, 2008","I purchased a 06 civic dx from this dealership early this month only to discover that the bank would not ""work"" with me on this particular vehicle because its value was less than the 05 civic ex  they were placing me into, and the bank was merely ""looking out for my best interest.""  After consulting with my banker I made the final decision on the switch to the 05 civic EX that had over 50k miles on it and a body style I disliked with a warranty that'set to expire at 60k (wow!).  James Pak, who assisted me in the transition was not at all the person I wanted to sit down and finalize the sales contract with.  He came off as being a rude individual.  He made me feel that I was there wasting his time when he stood and left while I was still deciding on what I should do about the switch he snidely replied ""I'll let you guys decide because I've got a lot of  other important things to do.""  Whenever he spoke to me his eyes were constantly blinking and rolling as if I didn't know a thing about purchasing cars when this was actually my third car-buying experience.  Before I had begun signing papers in his office, I also mentioned to him (as well as the salesperson, Sean Kim) that the brakes were worn out on  the 05 Civic and I expressed a deep concern and explained that I will be using this car to transport my  six year old daughter and five year old nephew to and from school everyday , but James Pak looked at me blankly, gave me the impression he didn't care about my family's well being and that he cared more about this car being sold. He made me feel his time was more precious and that he just wanted to expedite signing of the papers so he can go  home.  He  firmly insisted that there was nothing wrong with the car and he told me that cars all have a different feel.  My cousin who was with me while test driving this vehicle noticed that Sean had to pull  the brakes up when I attempted to make a right turn.  After waiting for close to 45 minutes on the forms that James had printed,  one or two of them which he admittedly made mistakes on, he told me that he was tired,  I went over the sales contract with Mr. Pak  and  noticed that he had increased the amount on my gap insurance coverage.  I asked him to change to what it was originally on my old sales contract which was 495.00,  I even pulled out my contract and showed it to him, only to be rudely interrupted when he snapped at me saying, ""To make this easier on you, I wouldn't be able to complete this transaction without that figure being on there""  referring to the 650.00 that replaced the 495.00 for gap insurance.  From experience, I know that gap insurance should never exceed 500.00.  I felt ripped off.  I honestly would not recommend going back here to purchase another vehicle if Mr. James Pak is still working there.  He'd be better off working in the dealership's car detailing department where he doesn't have to interact with clients on a day to day basis.  The rest of the staff was very helpful and living up to their motto ""Honda Helpful""  I strongly recommend Sean Kim for a promotion .  He has been helpful from the start and deserves it. ",1.7
667,"October 15, 2006","Purchased an 07 Civic LX sedan from Buena Park Honda today.  

Background:  To say that this car is popular is an understatement as I've searched many dealers these few weeks and they've been out of stock and/or on order.  This is my second Honda Civic purchase in the past two weeks and what I've learned is that some dealers will hide a popular car until they find someone who will be pre-qualified to take on the extended warranty before they magically reveal the car is available otherwise it will be on the way ""in a week.""  Since I had been lied to by other dealers during my shopping experience, I wasn't going to take it anymore and I would only buy if a dealer had the car in stock, physically on the lot.

Well, after calling and emailing 7 dealers around SoCal, I was very frustrated with the false promises and thought I'd give just one more call before giving up...  I made this call to a dealership I hadn't heard about before in my area.  Buena Park Honda.  So George Roman took the call.  I wasn't interested in another round of games so point blank I asked him if he would be able to match one of the other dealership's internet price.  He was very upfront with me and said yes right away.  He then went to make sure the car was in stock and he called back to confirm.  We set an appontment and  made the deal happen in a little more than an hour.  No games, no false promises, it was quite a strange to tell you the truth; normally when I go into a car dealership, I'm expecting a circus that usually goes into buying a new car.  My other Civic bought from Honda World in Westminster a week and half ago, took four hours and it was the worst experience.  I will post it on the review board there when I have a chance.  Anyway, today's deal with BP Honda was probably the most pleasant car-buying experience I've had and it was so fast that I will definitely be back to buy all my future Hondas  there.

The internet pricing option saved me a lot of time and money and opened my eyes to a lot of dealerships.  Some are better organized than others and the one at BP is decent.  I had faster responses from their competitors, but they didn't have what I wanted.   It worked out well because I discovered a dealership that seems to be on the upswing.  I noticed many of the Buena Park Honda folks  were upbeat, enthusiastic and they all congratulated me on the purchase.  Again, this is unusual because at the other Honda dealerships I've been to, the people would look away or show their best poker face rather than give eye contact when I walked by after a purchase.  What a difference a week and a half makes.  Also, special thanks to Christina the Business Manager.  She took time to explain everything in detail and  was very professional in answering all of my concerns about the financing details.  Not only a great professional, she's a great person too.  

Thanks again to George, Christina, and everyone there for making the car-buying experience an awesome one.",5.0
668,"January 12, 2006","I found this dealer through an internet quote service.  George Roman called me and asked what other quotes I had received for the car I wanted.  I told him the best quote I'd received and he said he would match it.  I asked whether he had the particular color I wanted and he said he did.  I verified that he would give me that price for that car and that he had the car on the lot.  I then drove an HOUR to his location.  Upon arrival he showed me the car, it was indeed the color & trimline I wanted.

We sat down to do the paperwork, but suddenly the price had been inflated by over $1000 with ""accessories.""  He had not mentioned any accessories on the phone.  I did not want any of the accessories.  But he would not remove them.

I ended up wasting two hours and driving 80 miles for a classic ""Fargo"" accessories scam.  This dealer is not honest.

669,"January 06, 2006",I got a great deal and they gave me a more than fair trade-in amount for my Toyota.  They gave me a great deal up front and then were very patient while I looked around at Norm Reeves and Garden Grove.  When I came back they gave me an even better deal and worked with me to find just the right color.  I was honest and upfront with them and they were honest and upfront with me throughout.  Very nice!,5.0
670,"May 01, 2004","Had an extremely negative experience. Bought a car from Buena Park Honda in December '03 and came back in April for my first oil change, supposedly ""free"" as promised by my sales rep. He just scribbled a reminder on a piece of paper that the first service would be free-of-charge.After arriving and being greeted by the service rep, they immediately go on the defensive and tell me that they don't normally do free oil changes without the proper ""paperwork"" and tell me to see a sales manager. I go see the sales manager and pretty much tells me ""tough"" and that they can't do anything about it, except to go talk to the sales rep, who conveniently does not work there any more.I find it hard to believe that they don't care about their customer base, all over a $29.95 oil change. They were not friendly at all and were not very accomodating either. I would NOT recommend this dealership.I tried giving them a chance. First, the sales was poor and they tried to strong-arm us into trading in our used car for only $400 (excellent condition '91 Toyota Camry). In addition this added experience with the poor customer service just for a ""free"" first checkup for $29.95 confirmed my belief that this Buena Park dealership is incompetent, unfriendly, and not very accomodating to their customers.AVOID AT ALL COSTS.",1.0
