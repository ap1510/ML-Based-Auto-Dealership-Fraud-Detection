I really hate car shopping but he helped me find the perfect car. I knew what I wanted but had no idea what to choose because of the different trim levels.

24,"February 11, 2020","I just left the dealer and it was horrible.  I was lured in with a car and price. When I got there  there was a sticker for another 2900.00 for GPS and blah blah blah.  Then looked at another car which was same make and model oh and same year with that same added sticker of 2900.00.  I didnt want all that extra so the would ""remove it from the deal"".  They acted like they did me a favor with the orig price of 17353.00.  So they made it seem like I got a steal!  Never negotiated the price.  I just left.

28,"January 25, 2020","Tracy and everyone was wonderful! No pressure or even mention of crazy add-ons and completely honored the price we had agreed on without trying anything to get it up. Tracy even had the car washed and ready to go when we arrived and had even set up our app, gotten paperwork going, etc. I drove an hour and a half each way with an 11 month baby because Tracy had given me such a positive impression throughout the initial negotiations (there were several Hyundai dealerships 15 minutes from my house), and it was totally worth it. She was so patient and knowledgeable and explained all of the features of the car and genuinely made the car buying experience enjoyable when it is usually very stressful.

37,"November 22, 2019","Nick Alkhouri was amazing. At first, the deal almost seemed impossible. I had little hope that it could be done (knowing what my circumstances with my car are). He stayed patient with me for two days and really helped me get into the car and payment that I love and  feel great about. He was realistic and honest with me from the very beginning. He kept it honest and professional. I felt so guilty taking up so much of his time but he that didn‚Äôt bother him. He just wanted to make sure that I was taken care of and happy. By the time I left, I was beyond all that. Now about a month later, I still love my car. I cannot wait to go back for service.

48,"September 19, 2019","Jorge serviced my car and found I had no oil. Huge problem, I know. He put oil in my car and fixed a few other minor things going wrong like my horn and air bag light. There is something wrong with my engine but the cost to repair is extremely expensive so I declined service for that.  I gave this review 4 stars not because of Jorge but the dealership normally gives a complementary wash after but they did not wash my car. Also took quite a while. I dropped my car off at 8:30am and didn‚Äôt get it back until almost 2pm. Overall pretty good service. ",3.8

54,"September 10, 2019","        Although Anthony is 'relatively' new on the service-writing side of the dealership (recently promoted from within), he demonstrated the same stellar commitment to customer satisfaction that many Ontario Hyundai customers have come to know and value. One can see that Anthony is attentive and anxious to ensure any questions are answered, and he goes the extra mile when making the customer feel they chose the right dealer service organization. But dedication and professionalism doesn't end with Anthony. 
        The list of courteous, professional employees I've encountered is too long to cite. I'm always made to feel like family when having my car serviced, and these folks have earned my trust with their oft-demonstrated integrity. And this is why I drive 45 miles one-way to have my car serviced at Ontario Hyundai--as I have now since 2010.

60,"August 05, 2019","There‚Äôs a salesperson at this dealership that everyone refers to him as ‚Äò‚ÄôK‚Äô‚Äô. I respectfully believe that he he walks the walk and talks the talk that a professional salesperson should demonstrate. He connects with ordinary people at whatever level or walk of life they come from. A very professional, efficient down to earth engaging person listening to the clients needs rather then goals of the dealership to ‚Äò‚Äôsale sale‚Äô‚Äô.

I live closer to another Hyundai dealer but quality of repair and the satisfaction for the cost of repair at Romero can't be beat. This was my experience again with 
Spencer and the crew at Romero when I had to leave my car overnight for an ordered part. That was after great shuttle service to and from my school in the morning.  This is all on top of prompt scheduling and friendly follow up on all repairs.   ",4.8

70,"May 05, 2019","I drove out to Ontario after doing some research on a used vehicle i was interested in.  Though a great distance,  I hoped for a good outcome.  It ended up being a long draining day! The price was not what I had seen on line and what was verified prior to the drive. I immediately should have left. I was convinced by Devyn that the added STICKER pricing could be removed.  I was there 4 hours. I promised myself I would not allow this to occur & it did.  As late as it was there was no time to discuss the specifics nor get a feel of the car. Alfonso stated, don't worry we will assist.  I actually believed that he would honor his words.   Alfonso Morales stated that the additional sticker items would all be removed.  They were!  I decided to have him add one item to the contract due to the hassle free conduct expressed and done.  He stated that they did not want me to purchase anything I did not need or want.  I felt confident that they wanted to do business and actually put a change to their deceptive actions.  I purchased the car and soon noticed prior to leaving that the chip was missing and the panels on one of the doors was damaged.  They would not put anything in writing.  By now it was close to 9:00 p.m. I arrived around 4:15. Rocky Edwards promised to fix it.  Devyn promised to send me the chip to the navigation. It has not occurred and they are not being accommodating anymore.  I changed my mind the following day about the paint guard. I confidently sent out my emails and phoned the dealership.  I was ignored.  When I finally received a message from Rocky, he stated that certain items were not refundable never adding the paint guard as being one of them.  I made the long drive notifying Devyn and Alfonso and neither notified me not to come down to the dealership. I arrived only to be ignored and told by someone I had never met that I would not be assisted.  I was Livid.  Since that day, the dealership has not cooperated and I have filed a couple of complaints.  Do not find yourself purchasing anything extra! it is not mandatory and if you do, ask if its refundable and get it in writing.  I found their deceiving tactics distasteful. They wasted my time and had no regards at all! ",1.0

79,"January 30, 2019","Took my granddaughter to purchase a used car,the price was set. A very slow rainy day, no customer's, finance manager had us waiting for him a couple of hours, he was in his office adding options to the contract that we didn't need or want. I asked the sales guy to go see what was taking the finance manager so long. He finally came out and sat at our table showing my granddaughter and I what he is going to do for us , by adding extended warranty and gap insurance, for an additional $2900 . We told him no, he went on and on about how good it will be for my granddaughter to have the extended warranty.We told him no again. Finally we get into his office to sign papers on the vehicle, but before we do he had another offer for us. The loan was for a 60 month contract, but his new offer for the extra warranty and gap insurance was now $1995. He was going to pay the first 6 months and the contract went to 66 months, he was trying to pull a fast one on us. That really showed me that he was a scammer. They also padded the interest rate that came back from the bank. Buyers stay clear of Ontario Hyundai. They will try to add as much as they can to a vehicle purchase.

105,"August 07, 2018","My first real no hassle experience.   I know my cars and what I want and not every sales person or dealer considers a buyer‚Äôs past (Such as I ha e a Hyundai family and clearly I bought my car from same dealer and serviced my vehicle at Hyundai).  Tracy heard me, respected me, considered my past experience (including a not so good interaction with an F&I guy or sales guy).    I knew the car and price I wanted that would be realsonae for sales, and Tracy met me all the way on the deal - and she even went above and beyond.

If all sales people could do that, the reputation would speak for itself amc people would be back.   They were lucky I came back and now I have a much positive review.

Tracy would get my business again because she streamlined the process as best as possible.

Give the sales people more power and look at the results.    It is a win win.   Thank you, Tracy and thanks for my awesome new F&I guy.  I know they have a job but they got me and respected my wants.

We got no hassles from Ontario Hyundai like other dealerships.  We gave Tracy the details of what we were looking for in an SUV.  She told us she had one in stock, but it did not have the leather seats like we wanted.  She asked us is we wanted her to hold it for us since we couldn't drive down the hill until the weekend.  
Once we got to the dealership, we knew this SUV was right for us.  The process went smoothly, and we were in and out from test driving to signing the paperwork within two hours.

I had been to a few other dealerships where I had test driven different cars and couldn't entirely make my mind up. Nicholas was super helpful, very communicative and was not pushy at all. This made the entire process so easy - all while having my 6 yr old son with us. Compared to the other dealerships I had visited, Nicholas was the ONLY salesman that was able to explain how a Hybrid works, what was under the hood (important to my husband), and what the expectations of the car were. I eventually settled on a 2018 Hybrid Ioniq and couldn't be happier! ",5.0
114,"July 16, 2018","From start to finish Nick, our sales person, was very helpful in the process. We did use the Costco program and told Nick that going into it. We test drove three different models and two of them twice. All our questions were answered and many times with humor thrown in. This part of the experience could not have been better. 
It did take a long time to get all the paperwork done. To be fair, I can't remember the last time it was quick with any dealer. This seemed a longer than most. Not Nicks fault. When it came time for the final price it was not made very clear by the sales manager initially that the reason the per month price was higher than I had figured was because of an extended warranty they had added in. I did not get any push back when I asked for that to be taken off. In the future, however,  it might be best if the sales manager was a little more upfront with that at the beginning or at the very least showed two prices one with and one without. I know they like to sell those but by not truly disclosing this at the start it slowed the process more and it could make some people a bit concerned. 
On delivery of the vehicle a lot of time was devoted to us by Nick in going over all the features in the car, which were abundant. This even included pairing our phones for us and making sure they both worked and signing us up for Bluelink and making sure it worked. This made for a very pleasant end to the buying process. ",4.8

I came in looking a Versa Note, and my wife and I wanted to look at other dealers to compare our options. In order to sell us the vehicle, they told us that they would ‚Äúsweeten the deal‚Äù by ‚Äúthrowing in‚Äù a warranty as if it were new. That sounded like a good deal to me and my wife so we signed. They told us to sign ‚Äúhere, here, and here‚Äù and never even mentioned that they had added in $4,000 for the warranty, yes the warranty that they ‚Äúthrew in to sweeten the deal‚Äù.  Need I add that the Versa was only worth $9,000. They are a prime example of the stereotypical deceitful used car sales dealership. To make matters worse, I canceled the warranty to get the rest prorated back to me (I filled out the paperwork and handed it to them personally), but it was never taken off my loan value. The only thing that could make this remotely okay is if they took the $4,000 of my loan. Please advise your friends and family to take their business elsewhere. ",1.4
136,"May 20, 2018","My husband and I came in to purchase a 2018 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport that I had already pre selected and reserved. My uncle works for the Hyundai corporate office so we came with paperwork in hand. We asked for someone from senior leadership to help us as this was a simple situation and we did not need anyone in sales involved. 

Somehow Alfonso ended up with our paperwork, and came to tell us that the price would be around $2400 more due to some ‚Äúupgrades‚Äù such as special paint and some sort of additional insurance the dealership had applied to the car. These upgrades were not mentioned anywhere associated with the VIN number of this car, so we said no thank you, I would like the car without these upgrades, please honor my certificate for the price mandated on the paper. Alfonso wouldn‚Äôt do this and asked who my uncle is. I got my uncle on the phone so that he could explain that this certificate is a non negotiable paper from the Hyundai corporate office and they must honor it as a participating dealership. Alfonso said a few words, then hung up on my uncle and handed us the phone and walked away saying we are free to leave because we couldn‚Äôt have the car for the price specified on our rebate certificate. 

I was horrified and furious , I am 7 months pregnant and have never felt so disrespect at a dealership. We asked to speak to whoever is in charge and were introduced to Sam, who suddenly said they could give us the car for $400 more instead of the $2400 mentioned by his employee, so that they could break even on these supposed upgrades. 

We ended up leaving and driving to another dealership who had no problem honoring this certificate. ",1.0

When I arrived at the dealer we had a test drive and while on the drive Nicholas casually mentioned a ""market adjustment"" and that I had to speak to someone inside.

After waiting 5 minutes a guy named Ken (I think) came up and asked me if I wanted to put $2500, $5000, or $7500 down on the car. This confused me as that was not the advertised or agreed offer and I re-clarified that I wanted the advertised and agreed $2500 down and $275 per month that is all over Hyundai's corporates website and Ontario Hyundai‚Äôs website. He then tried to explain how they have the lowest mark up and that mark ups could be $5,000-$7,500. I then asked ""so you want to change me $5000 extra for this car"", he said yes so I walked out.

He then called me back trying to claim he was being upfront (upfront is posting the actual price online, honoring the nationally advertised price , and not agreeing to a lower price over the phone). He then tried to negotiate with me, I explained that I was lied to by his dealership so I would only take the agreed upon price of $2500 down and $275 a month. He said he didn't think his dealership would do that but that it was above his pay grade. I then asked him to put his GM on the phone and he refused. He then said he would talk to his GM and call me back.

He called me back and again stated he would not honor the agreed upon price. I am guessing he didn't actually talk to anyone since this dealership has proven they will lie and deceive to try and make a sale.

Do yourself a favor and find another dealership.

239,"November 05, 2017","I recently purchased a deep crystal blue mica 2017 Mazda 6 Touring from Ontario Hyundai Mazda. This is the second vehicle I‚Äôve purchased from Brian Webb. He was an absolute professional and helped me select an awesome vehicle that is fun to drive. After negotiating, I was able to come away with a deal that was satisfactory. 

When finalizing the vehicle purchase with the finance manager (Brian M.), I learned that Mazdas come with a third party security system (KARR) installed. I was informed that I would have to pay $895 to keep it activated. He indicated that if I decided not to keep it activated, my car would no longer have an anti-theft engine immobilizer. I was tired, wanted to close out the deal, so I went ahead and told him to keep the KARR alarm system active. Shortly after leaving the dealership, I reviewed the specs for the Mazda 6 again and confirmed that Mazdas already have an anti-theft engine immobilizer pre-installed by the manufacturer. I did not need to shell out an extra $895. I guess it was my mistake for not remembering that this feature was pre-installed beforehand. At the same time, I felt that the finance manager walked a fine line when stating twice that my car would be lacking an engine immobilizer if I did not pay to keep it activated. This was very disappointing, but a good learning experience.

During the walk-around of my new car, the car salesman and I both noticed that there were minor scratches to the paint on the right side of the bumper as well as on the driver side door. He mentioned I could bring it back to the dealership and offered to send it out to a third party auto detailer to buff out the scratches at no charge.

I took my car back to the dealership about a week or so later and it was sent out to a third party auto detailer. When my car came back from the auto detailer they used, I noticed there were swirl marks all over the paint of the car. I was upset and bit in shock that a car I had for less than 2 weeks now had swirl marks all over it. The swirl marks are more noticeable on the hood of the car, the right fender and the right back side of the car.

The appointment coordinator at the dealership who arranged for my car to be sent to the auto detailer agreed that the job on the car did not look good. She offered to send my car out to the auto detailer again at not charge. I was a bit hesitant, but decided to give it another shot. When I got it back the second time around, the paint on the car looked perfect. I did not see any swirl marks or scratches, so I was satisfied with the way the paint on the car looked at that time.

Fast forward a few weeks later. I always hand wash my car. After washing my car, I noticed that the same swirl marks that appeared on my car after the first trip to the auto detailer were back. I guess the wax the auto detailer used hid the swirl marks temporarily. Now, I‚Äôm back at square one. A part of me wishes I did not agree to send my car to the auto detailer. The issue is worst now versus when the salesman and I noticed those 2 or 3 small scratches during the initial walk-around. I guess I will have to live with it for now and will probably have a new paint job done in the future.

Overall, I love the way my car looks and drives. The car buying experience at Ontario Hyundai Mazda is better than most, so I would buy another vehicle from them in the future as well as recommend them to others. I decided to still give a good rating because I had a good experience working with the Brian Webb.

I've experienced my fair share as well so I was prepared for the worst when I went to Ontario Hyundai Mazda. However, what I experienced was the complete opposite. Everyone I met was very helpful and courteous. My salesperson was Alfonso Morales and he was extremely friendly, very knowledgeable, and not pushy at all. In fact, Alfonso provided one of the best car buying experiences I've ever had and I've purchased a lot of cars over the years.

She respected our decision to collect offers from other dealerships and only asked for us to give her a chance to beat it. Unfortunately, the financing side was unable to find an agreeable offer, but nonetheless we greatly appreciated her service.

But from the moment we walked into Ontario Hyundai we were greeted immediately w/ friendly faces, talked thru all of the various models to find the perfect fit, hopped in and test drove the car that we ended up driving home, worked thru paperwork and negotiated a deal (a great deal!) extremely quickly.

I asked why  he did not pounce on us as soon as we stepped onto the car lot. He said that it wasn't like that here. It is very relaxed here and we don't want to pressure people. From that moment I knew it would be a completely different new car buying experience. I explained what I wanted and what I did not want in the car. After discussing the options we decided the  2017 Hyundai Tucson Night would be the best fit. There was a blue one on the lot but I really wanted one in gray. Julian said he would check other dealerships to find it. We took a test drive in the blue Tucson and he explained the many features of the vehicle. When we returned from the test drive, a gentleman named Marcus handed Julian a set of keys. The keys were for the Colosseum gray Tucson Night. It had just arrived and was still packaged in its protective wrapping.   While waiting for the documents to be completed we chatted with Mr. Sam for a few minutes. Everyone there is friendly and seemed genuinely interested in helping you. From there the rest of the paperwork went quickly. Donnie in the finance department had things ready to go. I was asked why I travel to 50 miles to their location when there are Hyundai dealerships closer to where I live.   Basically the reviews for the closer dealerships were poor. Customers complained of poor service and unfriendly stuff. I am happy with my decision to give Ontario Hyundai a chance to sell me a car.  Julian made car buying fun and stress-free.

He wore a smile on his face, a cap on his head, was enthusiastic and polite.  He was extremely well informed about the multiple models of Hyundais in stock at Romero.   He demonstrated the vast array of vehicle options and gadgets and was indeed, a wealth of information.  We took test drives in several Hyundais and finally happily settled on a 2017 Santa Fe.  
I think many folks would agree with us, that shopping for a new car is not a barrel of laughs and actually, we would have preferred to have been at Disneyland.  However, Disneyland does not sell automobiles! 
Having said that, we want to thank Phil, a terrific salesman, who gave us a great shopping experience and we would highly recommend him to anyone who is ""car shopping.""

From the moment I entered the dealership offices, I was greeted warmly, and Tracy was ready with all the paperwork (we had bargained over the phone). She had previously updated me as to what would transpire once I came into the offices and had provided me a written offer that I had accepted before going to the dealership. She answered the many questions I had and was very patient with me.  I also wanted to acknowledge the receptionist. Prior to contacting Tracy, I had called this dealership with some inquires and the receptionist was helpful and very friendly.   The dealership staff went above and beyond with their customer service. In fact, Tracy and another staff delivered the Veloster to the place of residence of the borrowed car I was using so I did not have to trouble other family members to pick up my borrowed car.

418,"March 25, 2017","One of the worst experiences I have ever had with a business!!! My daughter is attending her masters program at SDSU and needs to replace her car so I start looking at Mazda dealerships because she wants a CX5 and I find Ontario Hyundai Mazda, also called Romero Mazda. I find a 2016.5 CX5 I like and set up a test drive with Brian Webb. I meet Brian and he shows me the car, I explain the car is listed online as a 2016.5 model and he says he's pretty sure that is accurate and will check, I test drive the car and tell him I will talk to my daughter. My wife and I have excellent credit scores and my daughter has been establishing very good credit so we will want to co-sign with her. I find another car listed as a 2016.5 on their website and call Brian for a test drive, I go in again but like the first car better so I set it up to come back with my wife and let her co-sign with my daughter.

The next day I see the car price has been reduced on the website, nobody informs me but I have to inform Brian Webb, was he going to sell at the higher price if I didn't see the reduction?

I want to trade in my daughters current car. I am offered $600 and I inform them that two days prior another Mazda dealer offered me $1000. I am told the car fax shows an accident which I have to explain was an accident that was reported to our insurance company but was not my daughters fault and the extent of the damage was a blemish on the bumper, we did not have any repair done. I say I'll take the car to Carmax and get more than $600, they tell me that with an accident on the record that Carmax will not buy it. I call Carmax from the dealership and find that Carmax has no such policy. I inform the dealership of their error so that they don't say the same thing to other customers. I sell the car to Carmax for $1600.

Brian Webb prepares a sale contract to fax to my bank for financing, nobody offered to beat the special rate my bank offered. My bank loan rep gets the fax and informs us the numbers are wrong and don't add up, Brian has to redo the contract and fax again. It is now late and our bank rep has left for the day so my wife and I go home. Our daughter will be up from school on the weekend and can complete her end of the paperwork. We get a call the next day that the second fax was not received and the first faxed contract was so bungled it was unprofessional. We inform Brian the second contract needs to be faxed again. 

We meet with another Brian in financing who informs us our credit is so good he can finance the loan himself and match our bank's rate, too late we are staying with our bank. Why weren't they offering this before? At every turn we are confronted with questions of their integrity.

On the weekend I meet my daughter at the dealership to complete the contract. I see on the final contract the car is listed as a 2016 and not a 2016.5 model, I ask Brian Webb is this true and he says it is a 2016. I explain AGAIN that the car is listed on their web site as a 2016.5 and was never informed otherwise even though I inquired with HIM earlier. Brian Webb tries to tell me that I should have noticed this earlier. Now I'm insulted and getting madder every time Brian Webb insinuates that I made the mistake which he does repeatedly. I researched the 2016.5 model and was under every impression that was what I am purchasing. I ask Brian for the difference between the 2016 and the 2016.5 models, ""I don't know"". Brian is not new to the dealership and does not know the difference? After more insinuation that it is my fault for not seeing the misrepresentation of the model, a senior salesman takes over. We research the issue for over an hour and find that the cars on the web site are listed as 2016.5 but are actually 2016, the difference is navigation and heated seats. Eventually I am offered the upgrades to close the deal. After hours of squaring away the ineptitude I was about to walk away but the senior agent was trying to rectify the issue in an earnest manner. After 4 hours that day, my daughter has her car.

2 weeks later my daughter gets a ticket, the registration tag is a year old and the paperwork placed by the dealer in a packet on the windshield was folded and not readable. I check the DMV web site and registration/stickers are mailed 5 days after electronic filing. I call the dealer and ask for Brian the finance manager who processed our paperwork, he's not available so I leave a voice mail to contact me and explain the issue. I call back 3 hours later, he's still busy so the receptionist takes my info and will give it to him to call me. 2 hours later I call and talk to someone who tells me it takes at least 3 months, wrong! I finally get a call from Brian the next day and the registration is being filed today, one month after sale. The dealer also was supposed to put paper plates on. We now get to go to them for replacement paperwork for the windshield, paper plates and spend time fixing a ticket.

Such a sad experience

427,"February 11, 2017","TOP 5 THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW WHEN BUYING A CAR AT ONTARIO HYUNDAI
1.The price on the windshield isnt the price  because with add ons fees and stuff you didnt ask for ,the price will go up .see sontata blog 2 and 1
2. Read the contract IT DOSENT MEAN ITS FINAL . The dealer gave itself a back out clause even after the contract has been signed by you and them
3.If you want to back out you have to purchase a back out of deal clause .but do they pay you ;;;nah
4. With us we signed a contract that was reasonable.but in less then a week  they backed out '[give us our car back ' the NICE letter said... why! we had a deal ,,nope
5.they will ruin or damage your credit. on the 3rd contact yes 3rd ,, they went through as many creditors they can find . with every credit inquiry it affects your credit , it did mine unbeknown to me the dealer  went through more then 6 creditors,
thanks ONTARIO HYUNDAI.

Called on Monday spoke to Brian in finance dept about the higher rate which is when he advised that Arrowhead wanted us to put $ down, therefore he went with Wells Fargo. He was to order the mats, but weren't. My husband got a call from a woman regarding our experience and he mentioned the whole finance charge higher rate  and what was the status on the car mats.

He always goes that extra mile, even though I left with a brand new car he never skipped a beat in servicing the old one. My salesperson Brian was amazing! So knowledgable and honest and friendly, he really made the deal impossible to refuse. He spent ample time listening to what brought me in and found exactly what worked best for me. I let him know what my concerns with my old car were so every feature he shared with me in the new Hyundai was tied back to one of my concerns. Brian partnered with another man on the sales floor who made it such a relaxed experience and they both celebrated the possibility of me leaving with a new car. I would really like to thank the general manager who really made the deal possible. That kind of generosity is what brings customers back! Donnie the financing manager was also very friendly and very professional.

We contacted Tracey prior to when we were ready to purchase our car and she patiently took us on a few test drives and pointed out all the features. Once we were ready to purchase we emailed Tracey to set up an appointment and she had two options for us to look at. We purchased the sport model in the color Sedona Sunset. 

Tracey practically read own minds for what we were looking for in Tucson and for a payment. We have worked with Tracey to purchase 5 vehicles now. It is always a pleasant experience. Tracey is very knowledgeable and does not leave out any details. She works hard to make sure the vehicle you purchase is ready to be enjoyed the minute you take ownership.

There were minor scratches due to its removal, but Amanda Watson and the service team did a great job fixing the scratches to look brand new again and gave me a free rental car as service was being done.  The sales staff were great as well when i purchased the vehicle.  Mark (don't know his last name) did a great job showing me the car and working with me through the negotiation process.  The Hyundai facility was very clean and professional, which was a plus.  The staff was good at showing me all the options, but were not pushy at all.  It's been a month now and everything has been great and I still feel like I got a very fair deal for my car.  I would recommend, however, to not add dealership stickers to the vehicles.  If the dealership would not have removed the sticker I most likely would not have purchased the vehicle.  I do not like having my brand new car be a driving advertisement and the stickers are very difficult to remove if the customer does not wish to have it.

I have always had excellent service at Romero Motors in Ontario, CA. Unlike most dealerships, they always wash your car after service.

Director who had tried unsuccessfully for a couple of weeks to find me a certain color and option package for a 2015 Genesis.  I spoke with Tracy  Saturday morning and picked up my car Sunday morning.  Tracy Benjamin was awesome and would highly recommend her to anyone looking to purchase a car.  She went above and beyond and I can say she provided me with ""World Class Customer Service.""

Spencer Gilliland is one of the best service advisors I have worked with.  He worked hard to ensure that I got the most ""bang for my buck"" when my Genesis developed an unusual electrical issue, and fixed the problem with only a modest labor charge.  Other dealers may have taken advantage of the ""mystery"" of electrical troubleshooting, and charged me accordingly.

I knew what I wanted, what I was willing to pay and was fine with walking away from any deal that didn't meet my price point.  This was my first experience with Hyundai, in fact, I never saw myself in one.  From beginning to end I was treated with respect and wasn't given the run around by my sales rep or the financing manager. Ontario Hyundai worked hard to meet me in the middle during negotiations and it felt good leaving the lot knowing I got the best deal possible.  Or at the very least, feeling that way.  If you hate the stress of negotiations, have done your research and know what you want, this is a great place to finalize your purchase.  ",5.0

When we arrived Ryan Youssef greeted us with a friendly smile and promptly began to ask us the pertinent questions. My husband and I are both in sales and appreciated this.  We both thought he was very thorough and knowledgeable.  There was NO pressure, which was great.  He was sincere in just wanting to know how to better meet our needs.

 After we found the car we wanted, in the perfect color, and with all the bells and whistles......we began the negotiations with Ryan's Sales Mgr Rocky. What an experience! Pleasant, no pressure and painless!!

In the end they really did meet ALL OF OUR NEEDS and at the RIGHT PRICE!! We were so excited and extremely happy when we drove off.  We have bought many cars in our lives and I tell you this was by far the best experience we‚Äôve ever had yet!

Let me say that up until this time they have been very courteous, helpful and timely getting me in and out. However, after waiting for the checkup to be done, they came out and showed me a list of things that needed to be done. Tires being one, I understood and expected this. But, a list of other items that were no where needing to be done. Specifically, brakes he told me I had only 5% left!!! On a 2011, Mazda 3 with 36,000 miles on it. REALLY??? Now, being that I have 3 brothers (1 is actually a mechanic) and a father that have taught me quite a bit about cars, I didn't think that was possible and declined having the repair done. With my work hours I didn't have the opportunity to have them checked for over a month, and when I did, I was told I had more than 50% left!!!! 
Shame on you Mazda service department. I understand you are on commission for upselling but really trying to get someone to pay that much for a brake service that is NO WHERE near needing to be done. Why?? Because I'm a girl??? I would think you would want to keep you customers coming back to you. I will not have any services done here other than my maintenance check ups. ",1.6

They first tried to rip us off with a very high monthly payment and high interest rate although i have excellent credit. Because i looked young, they probably didn't think i was smart enough to know what a good deal was, they were going make me end up paying 10,000 just in interest over the 60mo term on a trade in car that was worth 7500. i said no thanks. they called me back the next day and said they wanted to make a reasonable deal so they gave us a deal over the phone and said we had to come in asap to sign, this was in the middle of the week and was a school night for my son and i had to report to work early so since the deal couldn't wait till the next day we went to the dealer after hours after they closed and they made the deal which was still a bad one but my choice, i needed a vehicle. then they send a letter stating i need to return the car because they couldn't find a bank that would finance me. i called the dealer they said don't worry about the letter were still working an a deal with the bank. days passes no call, i called dealer back spoke with another person, this person said he had great news!! he found a lender for me and i will end up paying a lot less and fewer months with lower way lower way lower interest, it went from 18% down to 2%. guy called back and said sorry we cannot make that deal etc etc. okkkk... then they call weeks later to tell us we have to return the vehicle when we had already put money into the car like tint the windows, something that was irreplaceable and sold my previous vehicle because i got this newer one . I paid my down payment cash and when i asked if they can please return the down payment the way they received it they said no and it was the weekend banks were closed and i needed the money to go buy another car because i needed a car to take my kid to school and myself to work and school when i asked if they can give us enough time or a rental to find a new car they said no.

I started checking online prices for the different repairs and come to find out they were more than double for all recommended repairs. We then to our van to another repair shop which was highly recommended from Yelp and had them inspect the vehicle, they found the van had been in a front end collision at some point and the impact bar had been pushed into the radiator causing the leak and recommended a new radiator and condenser. He tested the water pump, thermostat, hoses, serpentine belt and found them all to be in like new condition. He was shocked to say the least that the dealer said we needed to change all of these other items! He checked the front brakes and found them to be over 50% of the pads left.

When talking with David Salem, not only did I receive the price I wanted for the Mazda 5, I was able to get the correct value for my trade in as well and they prevented me from driving to Los Angeles.  The whole process was expedient and worthy.  I only wish that Romero Motors was closer to my home so I could handle my servicing through them as well.    ",5.0
772,"February 03, 2012","Bobbi was great she really put my mind as ease. I had so may questions and concerns.I was also worried about my budget and not being able to get something that I really wanted, but Bobbi was really willing to help me and work with me. I never trusted any body when ever I walked into a dealership. But I really got the feeling that Bobbi cared and she was giving me the best deal possible. She just seemed so nice and worry free. She had answers to all of my questions. ",4.8
773,"February 02, 2012","Phil Schmall of Romero Motors Hyundai is the most professional sales person I ever worked with.  Phil is courteous, polite, helpful, patient and he goes the extra mile to get the deal accomplished.  I was definitely impressed.  I would definitely recommend Phil and Romero Hyundai to my friends :)

I bought a 2012 Hyundai Sonata Limited Turbo with Navigation.  ",5.0
774,"January 31, 2012","I bought my Mazda 5 in this dealership on January 28, 2012.  I was met by Nick Alkhouri, who was very friendly and knew his product very well. I continued with Zee Spall. He was really fun guy to make a deal with. I can say that both sales associates were pretty honest in answers.
After working some numbers with Zee, Brian Meschon came out to help me to get what I wanted. He gave the price I wanted for the car, and most important, he was able to get me financed. The reason is I am the first time buyer with a very light credit score. I was expecting astronomic APR, but it was surprisingly low for my situation. 
By the way, I made my homework and knew about true market value for the car. I got it for $500 cheaper than I saw on some car websites.
Donnie Harris from finance was super-fast with the paperwork.
Overall I had an excellent buying experience with Romero Mazda. And I want to thank everybody who helped me to purchase my car, which I love by the way!

775,"January 30, 2012","I had a 2005 Honda Civic with 342,000 miles on it. Time for a new car. I did my research and chose 2012 Hyundai. When I went to the dealership I was greeted by Joey Amaya. He had avery relaxed attitude, which was great because I cant stand the ""Rick Slicks"". He heard at my story on got straight to work on coming up with the best possiable solution for me. Joey and the 2 other gentlmen involved in the deal where great. Just Real People, working on a real deal. No Bull. I loved it.",4.8
776,"January 27, 2012","I stopped by after my sons baseball game last night to take a quick look and test drive a Mazda 3 Hatchback.  Brian Poff just happened to be walking by as we were getting out of the car.  He showed us the Mazda 3's and explained the difference in the models and options.  We test drove one of the Grand Touring models with the Skyactiv powertrain. One thing I appreciated was that Brian let us drive the car long enough to get a feel for how it handled at slow speed, during acceleration and cruising speed.  He answered all my questions and I left knowing that the Mazda 3 GT with Skyactiv was the car for me.  I have been looking for a new car for almost a year and finally found one that included all the options I had been hoping for in my price range... (excellent gas mileage, navigation, heated seats, Bose (BOSE - more than I had hoped for) speakers!, heated seats, power drivers seat, dual air controls, Bluetooth, leather package and more....

777,"January 27, 2012","When first arrived took a while to meet up with salesmen, which was a Hundai man. Then when looking at Mazda Joey was introduced to us and he was great. Extremely informative, friendly, not pushy, answered all questions, . I totally trusted all his comments. ",4.8
778,"January 26, 2012","it took me a while to write something about my first car that I bought. My family and I went to Romero to see Elantra or Accent. A sales man greeted us and showed us the Elantra. When we asked questions the first thing he said was, ""I will make sure that you have all the correct answers. On the same token I want you to know that it is my second day working at this dealership and with this brand.""
My family and I look at each other saying thank God we won't deal with old school sales pushing.

We test drove the cars and he gave us the numbers. We really wanted to get more discount but Elantra is the hottest car and since we liked our salesman we paid little bit more and got my first car!!

From the start till the end everything was perfect. At the end our salesman told us that it was his first car.... we took pictures -- good memories. Our salesman's name was Zee who is still intouch with us. Romero motors and Zee will always be on our list for our next cars!!!! Thank you for everything:) ",5.0

780,"January 26, 2012",I've been searching around for a new car ever since my ride broke down a couple months ago. Joey Amaya made me feel comfortable and at ease in my car hunt. He did not pressure me like other car salesman have done during this long search for a new car. Joey was very knowledgeable about cars and the Mazda 3 which I showed interest in. He acted in a professional manner and he was able to build rapport with me instantly. I will definitely be back to test drive the Mazda 3 in the near future and will be contacting Joey when I'm ready to make my purchase!! I would recommend others to buy from Joey Amaya. Very professional person!,4.8

So We Looked Around And Joey Helped Us Figure Out What We Where Looking For! We Checked Out A Few Cars And Asked A Lot Of Questions. Joey Was Very Knowledgeable With His Answers And We Didn't Feel Pressured At All. That's A Great Feeling When Looking To Buy A New Car! The One Car We Really Liked Was The Mazda 3! We Will Be Back To Test Drive It. If It All Works Out We Will Buy From Joey. Thanks, Richard.",5.0
782,"January 25, 2012","My wife and I would like to thank you for all of the kindness, courtesy and professionalism you showed us on our visit at the end of last year. We really didn't know what to expect at the dealership, and we were surprised to discover a level of caring competence that assured us we had made the right choice.
We're thrilled with the car, and already looking forward to a road trip to Vegas in February. Thanks again for taking care of us, and we wish you lots of success in the days to come.

Sincerely, 
Alfonso and Susie Wagner.",4.8
783,"January 24, 2012",Visited Romero this past weekend looking for a CX-9 and purchased one.  We were approached by Erick when we stepped out of our car.  He was very friendly and patient as we took multiple test drives.  He took time to understand what are concerns and expectations were and tried to make it happen. We traded in a vehicle with out any hassle and overall the negotiation process was fair and cordial. We negotiated with Fransisco who tried to help us get a deal that worked for us.  The visit did take awhile from the time we arrived until we drove off but overall it was a pleasant buying experience.  If you are in the market for a Mazda or Hyundai I would at least give these guys a shot. We love our new vehicle!!  Thanks guys!,4.8
784,"January 23, 2012","I went to this dealership to purchase a new sonata. Although I did not make a purchase, my dealing with dealer Marina was wonderful.she was respectful, knowledgeable and provided an enjoyable no pressure experience. I highly  recommend her. It was unfortunate I was unable to negotiate a deal at the hands of upper management.",3.8
785,"January 21, 2012","Joey approached us as soon as we parked, which immediately, was a turnoff.  However, my feelings changed when I realized he wasn't pushy, and he was very knowledgeable in the cars I was inerested in. Also, very nice and invited me on test drive even though I wasnt exactly ready to drive home in anything. (I'm waitinng for my taxes in about 1 month). The best part for me about him and this dealership is that he was or at least seemed he was genuinly interested in hearing me out vs. just trying to sell.  I plan on returning and hopefully he is still there. 

thank you for making my visit pleasant. :)",4.6

He was relaxed, straight forward, and just gave us the information we were looking for...with a willingness to accommodate our budget. Rare traits in car salesmen! If you want to buy a car, I really recommend asking for him to give yourself an easier and less stressful experience!",4.6
788,"January 13, 2012","My husband and I have purchased several vehicles from Tracy Benjamin with Romero Hyundai. She has always been attentive to what I can afford and to what my other needs may be. This is what I appreciate the most. For this reason, once you have had a sales person who has the knowledge and experience to advise you on all of your options. You hold on to them. I have referred Family, friends and co-workers to her without hesitation or disappointment. She never lets me down.

From my earlier car buying experiences. I would have never thought that purchasing a car could be fun. I can't wait to purchase my next car. 

Thank you Tracy.

792,"August 23, 2011","I started off going through internet sales and worked with Herbert Santamaria who was just great at calling me to explain the pricing, their interest rates and what my payments would be. He was very thorough, took his time with me and when I came in, he took me on a test drive and explained everything I needed to know about the car.

After that time I worked with Francisco Ferro to discuss my loan preapproval etc. He was definitely your sales type guy and at first seemed a little pushy (which I understand is what you would want in sales), but once I spent some time discussing things and working out all the details of how my credit union loan worked I realized what a great guy Francisco was. He was patient through the whole process (and believe me, the process got quite complicated), he continued to explain things and assure me we would get things worked out. Through this process I was constantly calling him and if I couldn't reach him and left a message he would promptly get back to me. Because of my credit union loan process I lost out on the vehicle I chose (not once but 3 times)and everytime this happened, Francisco found me another one. He truly worked hard to get me exactly what I wanted! For this I sincerely thank him and he gets an A++ from me for providing such wonderful customer service!! Thank you so much Francisco Ferro, you are what customer service is all about!!",5.0

The sales people I worked with were very friendly and made me feel right at home. Still need to get Zee that Pastrami sandwich.

Nevertheless I chose my preferred Sonata which was a white Hybrid. By doing so Mr RAhardjo kindly invited us inside and provided excellent hospitality along with a wonderful smile.
