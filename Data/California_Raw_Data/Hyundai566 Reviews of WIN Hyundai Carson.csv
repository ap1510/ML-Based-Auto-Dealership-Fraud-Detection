0,"May 01, 2020","STAY AWAY!!!! I leased a Sonata giving my leased VW as part of payment. They were supposed to pay off my old lease but it never happened. May is the third month I’m paying for both cars. They don’t return my calls and emails and I already went over there twice to try to fix it. They don’t honor their word and they don’t care about customers after the purchase. I am going to see a lawyer to make them do it right. If you are looking for a Hyundai or Chevrolet, don’t waste your time and health going there.",1.0
1,"March 11, 2020","David who'd helped me w test drive was very knowledgeable, patient, and laid back. I think he's the best car sales person I had ever worked with. I highly recommend him and would have given 5 stars but since it's dealer rating not a sales person I took one star off. Because when it came to financing portion there was some miscalculations, change of APR without pointed out to me. Overall a great dealership w helpful, friendly staffs. ",4.0
2,"March 06, 2020","Nothing but good things to say about Win Hyundai. Everyone from start to finish was incredibly kind and helpful! Our sales person, Dave, was super helpful in the buying process. Would definitely recommend them if you’re looking for a new car!!",5.0
3,"February 20, 2020","This is my third time returning to this dealership and each time we are welcomed, accommodated and heard. David was able to get me the car I wanted at the price I requested. We spent a good amount of time here, but the process was seamless. Thank you! I drove back down from Pismo Beach, CA to lease my vehicle at this WIN location. ",5.0
4,"February 03, 2020","We had an absolutely wonderful experience here!! Fantastic customer service! I was initially assisted by a young man Alex. Very polite and well knowledgeable!  David assisted in the financial portion and gave us a great deal!  The general manager Nima stopped by multiple times to confirm everything was going smoothly. They were all very honest and we walked away with a great car, a great deal, and a great experience! This dealership came highly recommended by a friend and we will be back next time our family needs a car!! ",5.0
5,"January 04, 2020","My decision to purchase the Hyundai Kona EV Limited was largely due to David Aguilar. 

David was super nice and made us feel so welcome. As a woman trying to shop for a car, I have gone into many dealerships where the salesperson ignores me completely or gets irritated with my questions and answers them with short responses. David treated me with respect, taught me a lot more about the future car I was going to buy, and answered ALL my questions with a smile on his face. He really knows his vehicles and does not try to pressure you into buying a car that you do not want. He is open with prices and doesn't try to hide them from you or add unnecessary charges. I was still supposed to check out the Kia Niro but because of David's AWESOME customer service, I WANTED to buy the car from him and we did that same day!

Thank you David for making this car buying experience so fun and actually enjoyable! 

TIP: If you know you want a hyundai, skip the chevy side and go directly to hyundai. The chevy people don't know anything about Hyundai's. ",5.0
6,"December 31, 2019","While in the market for a new vehicle, David Aguilar assisted me on arrival. He was very knowledgeable and allowed me time to ask many questions. I ultimately purchased a new Santa Fe from him and would do it again next time I’m in the market. Over the years I’ve seen different levels of service, but David Aguilar is a seasoned professional at all phases of the deal. Thank you David for making my experience both informative and affordable.",5.0
7,"December 27, 2019",The entire process was very pleasant and quick which I appreciate. No BS. David Aguilar was great and provided Awesome service. He answered every single question we had and he was very thorough in explaining the contract and the car itself before I drove off the lot. Would definitely recommend him to friends & family. ,5.0
8,"November 30, 2019","First let me say that David is the absolute best! We went to approximately 4 different Hyundai dealerships over the course of a month looking for a new Tucson and my husband hated every single one except David at Win Carson. He despises the whole ""car dealership"" experience and detests the typical salesman pressure that they give you as soon as you walk in the door. However, that wasn't the experience when we walked in to Win Carson. David was so helpful, patient with absolutely NO pressure at all. After we met David, we took a test drive and decided to put a deposit down to hold the car. After a couple days, we called David and had him cancel the deposit since we were having second thoughts. However, after thinking even more about the amazing customer service we experienced with David and his very calm and no pressure demeanor, we knew that we had to come back - and called the next day to have him hold the car until the weekend. The rest is history as they say - thank you again David for all of your help! We love our new 2020 Hyundai Tucson! (aka ""future car"") :)",5.0
9,"October 30, 2019","David was THE best! I didn’t have the best experience with this dealer previously, but David made all the difference. He was super easy to work with, flexible with options, and very transparent. He even went over each booklet with me and sent me additional car info online as well. He is like the perfect anti-sleaze sales guy! Thank you again, David! I couldn’t be happier with my car and my purchase experience with you and Ivan. :)",4.8

11,"September 12, 2019",I contacted Win Via cars.com. verifying the car I was looking at and the price before making the 35 mile drive. Looked at the car and loved it. Talked again about the price with sales guy Art Simon's I even mentioned that I use to work at a dealership for 19 years. He had to get the price okayed by the sales managers because I didn't want to buy the snake oil package of waxes and alarms. The sales manager agreed to the price as listed on cars.com. I went home 35 miles picked up my Daughter as this car is for her. Drove back she drove the car and loved it. I told Art let's do it. This is were this dealer gets shady. The managers work up the paper work and they slip in the 2k in accessories thinking I wouldn't notice.  I refuse the deal and the manager  Artsrun Oganesyan comes in and tries to offer a discount on this accessories that they want to install on the car . I mentioned again I am not interested.  He then starts making excuses about there's no money in the deal without the package and they include this on every car after the deal is figured out. BAIT AND SWITCH.  I ask him to contact the original manager that had already  agreed to this deal and he refused.  Today I call the dealership ask to talk with the general manager and the receptionist refuses to put me through to his voicemail.  I then asked for  Hani Nassif  the owner's voicemail. She hung up on me . I have tried to call back and now they just put me on hold. I would sure think the Gm and Owner would love to hear about my experience with there dealership.,1.0

14,"July 11, 2019","I bought my Ioniq Plug-In from David A. He is very patient and super knowledgeable about not only this vehicle but other competitive similar vehicles. He was not pushy at all and honest.  When we were considering my current vehicle, he pointed out another vehicle that was comparable and even more cost effective for us.  We ultimately went with the one we first looked at but he also traded with another dealership for the color I wanted.  There was a later point, for a revision to the contract, he drove all the way to my work to get the signature.  That is great customer service. ",5.0

I am EXTREMELY happy with it. Thank You David!",5.0

24,"May 14, 2019","I wanted to send a letter to alert Hyundai to the unfortunate experience my family just had trying to buy a new 2019 Hyundai Kona. 
After my experience, I’m pretty sure no one will read this email let alone care. But if I owned this dealership or this company I would want to know how I just lost a loyal, BUYING customer. 

Until today, my husband was a longtime Hyundai driver that would happily drive Hyundais for the rest of his life. When our family needed a new car he insisted on another Hyundai. We both drove and decided on the 2019 Kona SE gas model. 

We researched and talked to numerous dealerships to get the best price. We finally talked to a dealership south of our location that quoted us an out-the-door price. We spoke on the phone and texted. The person I talked to said she had spoken to her bosses and they were aware of the price quoted. My husband, our 2 year old son and I drove the one hour south to this Win Hyundai dealership in Carson, CA to buy the car. 

Once there we did not get to see the woman whom we spoke with, we were told she was the assistant. We asked to drive the exact car we were quoted and the one we were going to buy and we were told that the prices were the same and we could drive any of them, so my husband test drove the car he thought we would buy while I waited with our two-year-old. 

We were very clear from the moment we arrived that we were there to buy the car for the out-the-door price we were quoted. I didn’t care about monthly payments, colors, trims- we just wanted to buy the car we were quoted for the price we were quoted. The salesmen said that price was good and he would try to get the same price for the car we test drove. We told him we didn’t really care about which car, we just wanted them to honor the price we were quoted.

That’s when the games started. The car wasn’t at that lot. The keys to the car couldn’t be found. The mileage didn’t match. 
Almost two hours later after being assured this will all work out, a new manager came into the office and basically said they would not honor that price for a myriad of reasons and stared talked different numbers and installed packages that were never even discussed before.

Long story short, they did not honor what they promised and when we called them out they said ‘too bad’ smiled like real jerks and said we can leave.

Like I said before, after this experience I’m pretty sure no one will read this email let alone care. But if I owned this dealership or this company I would want to know how I just lost a loyal, BUYING customer. 


Sincerely,
J

I was devastated,  but my husband took me to Win Hyundai and David A. took care of us right away.

53,"November 29, 2017","Staff needs to be better educated of Genesis vehicle and its inclusive service maintenance programs for a better explanation to its customers.  I am looking at the owner's manual for maintenance and it is not clear as well.  It tells me to replace engine oil in 3,000 miles but doesn't say why when I am assuming the engine oil it uses would be fully synthetic oils(this is also not shared in the owner's manual), which then would require replacement in 10,000 miles.  Owner's manual also does not say how many(i.e. 5 qtz) nor what kind of engine oil(i.e. fully synthetic; synthetic blend; or regular) should be put into its engine.  Not being clear of basic maintenance programs offered by Genesis for the new genesis vehicle is very frustrating for its new owner.  I get it that this is a new brand and the sales staff I worked with also was new so there will need time to fully understand its products and services.  Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and the vehicle exceeded my expectation.  You have a nice product, just need to educate your staff to better explain your products and services.

The offer was $4500 over CarMax's offer.  After being in the dealership for just an hour, I do believe many of the reviewers' experience(s) were exactly as stated.    However, every-single-person I came in contact with was professional, courteous, friendly, personable, knowledgeable, and understanding.

96,"August 31, 2017","Recently called in on an ad car.  After several phone calls, I was very pleased with the ease of communication and decided to drive down (72 miles each way). We were greeted by Jovan and had a really positive experience.  Took less than a half an hour to decide between 2 vehicles that we liked and came to an agreement on an Out the Door price.  No trade, no finance needed but interested in the Hyundai 1.9 incentive pricing if Win wanted it.  I had a previous appointment and needed to leave and then call back to either proceed or not.  Jovan was busy the rest of the evening and we reconnected the next day. I agreed to the price quoted the previous day. After 4 more calls back and forth, the final terms from ""sales management"" wouldn't let me buy unless I financed with Win at 4.9 %. I finally agreed to finance a lesser amount with them at the 4.9 and then change over to my credit union later. I had to finace $28000 or more at their high rate (costing more than $2000 over the Hyundai or my own credit union rate or they couldn't honor the deal. I've purchased over 100 cars ...my head spins with these kind of tactics....Very disappointing and absolutely no regard for anyone's time, miles or gas.....

113,"July 23, 2017","I walked in under the idea that I would be able to purchase a car advertised at 21000 that ended up costing way more. Many of the rebates did not apply as I was not a college student or an uber driver. Being a car dealership, I should have anticipated the price was too good to be true, but I liked John and wanted the car.  My biggest disappointment was dealing with the finance manger who explained the items of the contract, but upon closer look some things were optional though I was led to believe that the dealer covered the cost, i.e. paint protection. I also declined several offers for the maintenance package and somehow it ended up on the contract until I corrected the manager that I did not want the package. Had I signed, I would have been stuck with something that was, I believe, discretely put in hopes I would overlook.  The biggest disappointment I faced was the trade in, which did not happen. Even though I own the car outright and had a notarized letter from the former lien holder stating so, I did not have the original title and the dealer would not work with me. I was not given any guidance as how to correct the problem. I was offered  to store my car at the dealership until it was resolved. After contacting several other dealers and DMV's I was told that the dealer probably didnt want to spend the money to find the title or to acquire it. I guess spending 28k doesn't tip the service meter anymore. I decided to contact the GM and was directed to a voicemail that had no greeting or name, just a ""please leave your message at the tone"". I left a message and no one has bothered to email or call me regarding this issue.  I can not fault John as he did everything in his power to get the best deal, but I think his managers were not interested in helping him out. I could see it on his face. I appreciate his integrity and hope that in the future his managers will do a little more to help him make the deal. It should be noted I left the dealership during mid negotiation to attend a meeting in OC and then returned to close the deal. That was my commitment to John.  It is unfortunate that customer service, helping the customer, going the extra mile isnt a part of your culture.  As a person in management, I would have a conversation with those negotiating the deals in the back room. Yes, you are selling a car, but you are also selling an experience and customer loyalty. Unfortunately, all I received was the car.",2.2

118,"July 07, 2017","I came in to test drive a vehicle and also take advantage of their Amazon Gift Card offer with test drive. I never received my gift card confirmation even after I asked for it. They said it would come via email at the end of the month which never came. Initially came to see a 2017 Hyundai Tucson but the specific trim I wanted to see was not PDI'd so I had to wait in the lobby. We went into a Santa Fe and I was excited to see a CD player and informed Chris that a CD player was important to me (I'm old school I guess). He nodded and said that the Tucsons sill had them unlike the Sonatas. Unfortunately I never looked at the Tucson close enough during the test drive because I did not catch the lack of a CD player. WIN Hyundai also did not have the color of the trim I wanted so they had to get one from another dealer and I was promised that it would be ready and delivered to my house by noon the following day but this was pushed back all the way to 4pm. I decided to just pick up the car at the dealership and upon receipt of the vehicle, I noticed adhesive marks around the car which tells me that the car was not detailed as promised.

Then tried to say price included prior Hyundai ownership $1000 rebate not available on that model and could only sell is the car at the True Car price which was about $1400 more. We said no, and Chris came back and said the sales manager made a mistske and the price he originally emailed was the correct sskes price.  After we finished paperwork, Chris came back and this time said there were $1900 in rebates/incentives we didnt qualify for and pointed to a line on the email that said the price included all available rebates and incentives. Nothing that said you might not qualify for them in the email. When we were talking price at first, he did not mention rebates or incentives once. He is the Internet Sales Manager and did or should have known. In my opinion this is bait and switch tactics, intentionally misleading, and false advertising. Four different prices, with the highest price last. What a huge waste of time. My husband drove from LA to San Bernardino to pick me up, then to the dealer. 2 1/2 hr drive home in traffic.

If that's a sales tactic it must work because we ended up finally leasing a car through him the next day. The numbers guy (forgot his name, sorry!) was on the level and made sense, but we had to hold him back so we could think about it over night because we suddenly had to switch gears and think about leasing a car instead of buying it. Our indecisiveness, inexperience and trepidation was certainly a factor in how much time we spent both Saturday and Sunday at Win Hyundai.

150,"April 05, 2017","I was looking to lease a new Hyundai Santa Fe Sport.  I contacted the Internet Sales department at eight different Southern California dealerships surrounding my home in Long Beach, California.  All but two gave me a generic response, ""Come on in, we have the best deals, we won't be beat.""  Same old meaningless wave to get you to come in and turn you over to the sharks.

Two actually gave me real numbers to lease the car that I wanted.  One told me about a program called Boost-Up which would match up to $500 in free down payment money if I put up that amount and left it with the account for thirty days, and told me about a program to cover up to $5000 in car restoration-to-new costs at the end of the lease, but the monthly lease cost was higher.  Ricky Peters at Win Hyundai in Carson quoted me a lower cost, and when I asked him about the two programs he said that he was including the $5000 policy in the quoted cost, and agreed that the Boost-Up matching program was a great deal if I could wait the four weeks to get a car.  He also increased my annual mileage to 15K without increasing the lease cost.

I became more impressed with Ricky as we emailed several times during the Boost-Up waiting period, and when we finally met in person last weekend my wife and I signed the deal.

I was then surprised when my wife contacted me that day and indicated that there was a deal presented to her by Steve Suh (internet manager/director).  I am a very skeptical on any of it at first.  However, my wife persuaded me and since I said to myself if we don't like the deal, we dont have to proceed.

179,"March 07, 2017","That low rating is mostly for the customer service. Which was/is poor. I posted my review elsewhere but here it is again, in all its verbosity.

Well I suppose it's time to post my review of Win Hyundai in Carson.

It started off fine. I purchased a car from saleman Mike back in the middle/end of December. It was a trade-in/purchase. No real problems there. In fact outside of the time it took, it was relatively painless. Mike was an amenable guy. The trade was probably as good as can be expected, although getting the hard sell during the paperwork was a drag, but I know it's part of the process.

The more painful part started when 1. I didn't get the extra set of keys and 2. there was some confusion with the registration/license plates. In fact, the last reason is a contributing factor why I am giving them a poor review. The customer service. Or rather, lack thereof.

It was annoying enough that it took almost a month to get my extra keys 'programmed' and that I had to wait almost 2 hours during a Sunday visit. Ok, no problem. But over the course of the last 2 months, I've been getting a few letters DMV regarding my lapsing registration for the car I traded it, including a renewal and a warning notice. I was under the (correct) assumption that the registration paperwork I took care of with the sales team during the sales transaction (including for the trade-in) was eliminating the need for me to register the car or would also take the old car (the trade in) off the DMV registration rolls.

Apparently I was wrong. I'm still getting notices about the car.

Which leads to my current (ongoing, frustrating, disappointing) issue with the customer service department at Win Hyundai Carson. It sucks. I've been getting repeat emails (form letters) from Win Hyundai about a service appoint. Apparently I was just assigned a random appointment without my knowledge of scheduling, and just expected to be present. For whatever reason (the email didn't clarify.) When I tried to respond to the email, and to the email of a one Daniel Hernandez (Service Manager) - nothing. Even after repeated attempts to contact via email. And via the online chat (with 3 different chat personnel, apparently, none of whom, of course, work directly FOR or WITH Hyundai, they are just random chat agents who 'contact' Hyundai with complaints - or not since NONE of the 3 times I chatted, were my complaints or messages relayed BACK to Hyundai, or at least, responded too. And I placed a few phone calls DIRECTLY to Win Hyundai Carson, and left a few messages FOR Daniel Hernandez, via the (somewhat clueless) ladies answering the phone or leaving him a voice mail directly, on 2 different occasions. They didn't seem to have a very good grasp on what was going on or even seemed to care that much. I didn't get the cold shoulder (ear) but there wasn't much sympathy from them, even after I explained myself (a few times) and my situation (a real drag.) Subsequently, leaving a voicemail and message with customer service for Mike, my sales rep (whether he's even still there or not, who knows!) was to no avail.

So to encapsulate: 3 chats, numerous emails, numerous voice mails, numerous phone messages left with customer service representatives AND 3 communicates through Facebook messenger - which were responded to, and I was promised a response, over a week or two - and guess what? No return emails. No return phone calls. No return Facebook message (other than the empty promise of 'we promise we'll get to your message!' - another lie? strung along again) - NOTHING even after WEEKS of trying to get Daniel (or Mike, or... anyone) to return my messages.

Which, at this point, I almost forget what my original questions/issues were. Actually I do remember, all to well. The appointment i was booked for outside of my knowledge, and the status of my car registration (or deregistration of the trade-in car since that was promised to be 'taken care of' during the sale/trade in transaction back in December.)

So my recommendation? Car sales - ok. Customer service? Poor. The worst part? I'm a NEW CUSTOMER of WIN HYUNDAI! I just BOUGHT a new car 3 months ago! Is this the way you treat a new, potential long term, future customer? I don't think so. Incredibly frustrating, very disappointing, and certainly, not a company or dealer I would recommend just on customer service alone - which is probably one of the most important facets of a business, especially one that thrives on customer service with such a high quality, efficient automobile they are representing.

Truly stupefying especially now that I'm going to be taking the car I bought from WIN Hyundai and having it serviced and accounted for elsewhere. As well as my friends and family - who I won't recommend to use WIN Hyundai. I've actually gotten better and more efficient customer service from the Cable Company. Which is saying something (we all know how abysmal the reputation of customer service from the cable companies is).",2.3

He also listened to what we said & asked then addressed our concerns and was NEVER PUSHY nor OVERBEARING.  At one point in the negotiations (we were about $300 apart) the floor manager came in and very gruffly said to ""take it or leave it!! "" This manager said he didn't believe in customer care and customer loyalty.  We were very upset with his attitude, stood up and left.  We went to another dealership to pursue a car.  However Franklin did some internal discussions, then called us and got another manager to agree to his proposals in the negotiations (leaving the floor manager out of the picture).  We reached a satisfactory arrangement and then bought the car from Franklin (WIN).   On another note, There were a couple flaws in the uphostery seats.  Franklin checked this with the service staff and coordinated making it right - he said he wanted a happy custormer who felt completely satisfied with the car and with WIN/Hyundai.

Total nightmare dealing with this dealership. 
I received a notice about a recall on my car. I went it, and they were backordered on the part. Totally understandable. I made an appointment to go in. I show up on the date of my appointment, to be told that there is a three hour wait. What's the point of an appointment?? I will not be going to this dealership again and will definitely not recommend it to anyone. Save your time and money and visit another dealer. ",2.2

470,"December 31, 2015","I was not provided a ""Notice to Vehicle Credit Applicant"" as per FFVR 35 which explains in detail your credit score and how it was used. Prior to Car Buyer's Bill of Rights(FFRV 35) it was common practice for dealers to lie about you credit score to charge you higher rates that's why they MUST provide you with a copy of said score. Furthermore they added a $2,800 ""Service Contract"" without my direct approval that only benefits the lender and obviously the dealer. I came to this dealer through Uber for a lease and Alex gave me financial advise and said that he could lower my monthly if I purchased instead. I'm not a haggler and believed that the auto dealers had to fallow certain guidelines as a result this is how they helped me.
Price.....$19,280  basic MSRP 17,900
Floor mats...$250.00
First aide kit...$30.00 ( a couple of band aids, gauze and $.99 scissors)
Service contract (which is not required for delivery or finance) $2,800. Total......$40,000 for a $19,000 car.  Wow they saw me coming
And most importantly 21.0% APR with a credit score of 580 which is not good but on average it varies from 11.0% to 13.0% with bad credit at about 14.0% I talk to some lenders today and hopefully I can finance through them since it""s a secure loan (the car is the collateral). Let me leave you with this guys Dealers want you to pay  high interest because the lenders give them a kick back. It;s called dealer reserve. 
The only way way to deal with these out of control dealers is to get financed somewhere else and make sure they don't add unnecessary charges. They think because you sighed a contract that it legally binding, and in most cases it is unless there was intention to mislead, misrepresent, or withhold information for the sole purpose of making a profit.

When I think sonata I immediately picture the grill and now the day time running LEDs  that line the fog light housing. I was told while at the dealership picking out the car that it had them. I was so excited and the process took a couple of days that when I got the call that everything was set I jumped and ran to the lot picked up my car and when I got home... My wife points out hey didn't you say there were leds in front I said yes she asked where?  I go to look and sure enough they're missing I called to ask, even putting it on me that it was my fault for not checking and asked if I could order them and install them and pay out of my pocket for them. Till now I haven't been given an answer or solution. Thanks win Hyundai for fighting and getting me into a car that I wanted.... Or at least most of the car I wanted minus the LEDs. I know it's not that big of an issue I do love the car but at the same time ITS A HIGE ISSUE. now I'm looking at buying from 3rd party but oem parts and its $600 just for parts!

I had been communicating all day with Ana Romero from Win Hyundai in Carson about a used van.  It seemed like the right van for my family and the deal Ana had offered seemed like a good one.  But, you never know what you're gonna get once you get to a dealership.

I was pleasantly amazed!  Ana Romero is not only a competent saleswoman, she is just a genuine, warm, and friendly person.  I enjoyed just talking with her and she made the time I spent at the dealership go by very quickly and pleasantly.  

From the start I told her what kind of day I had had, and expressed my desire to not be at the dealership a long time (I had just purchased a new vehilce a week before and spent over 5 hours in that process!).  Ana, and her sales manager Chris, took care of me as if I was the only customer.  I arrived at the dealrship at 6pm, and I was driving away in my new-used van by 8pm!!!

565,"September 04, 2014","HORRIFIC SERVICE DEPARTMENT & SALES

I don't usually waste my time writing reviews and I don't really have the time to do them, but I had to leave a review for this place. 

SALES: I purchased my 2014 Veloster from them and this should have been grounds for me to run. The sales guy at first was accommodating, friendly and pleasing to deal with. He found me the car I wanted and all was good... until the day came when they ran my credit and he realized I had a trade-in. To cut all this short, his attitude changed completely and became totally distant. He even went as far as to say, ""Maybe you can go to another dealer."" Bottom line is I still got the car here despite his terrible attitude, and it was due to his boss that was more professional than he. Still this was an unpleasant experience... but this is not the worst part. 

((SERVICE DEPARTMENT)) 

DO NOT COME HERE. Their service department is just the worst. Horrible customer service. I called to make an appointment with them to bring my car in for several problems I am having with the car, and the person that answers the phone, 2 TIMES, I had him tell me, ""Can I give you a call back?"" and never did. I gave them one more try before I left this review and guess what... he said the same thing to me again. I am just horrified that a place like this would have such horrific customer service. Just to get transferred to the customer service department it took almost 10 minutes. The number you call initially is to Win Chevrolet, from there the person that answers transfers you to Hyundai, then the receptionist there asks where can she transfer you... again. I just don't get it. Go anywhere else but here. xxxx, even Southbay Hyundai is better, and they were horrible also, but at least they took care of me. ",1.0
