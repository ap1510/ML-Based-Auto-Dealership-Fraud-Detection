0,"May 02, 2020","I brought my 2017 certified pre-owned Ford Escape in the day after I bought it used from a dealership farther away to ask a question about the car.  I spoke to Steve in the service center.  He was rude and condescending.  He told me that if I didn’t like the car I had two days to return it and even if I had an extended warranty they weren’t going to fix anything anyway.  I did eventually get an answer to my question that I was able to verify but not before he had thoroughly disparaged me with his attitude.  Actually, I love the car and didn’t want to return it.  I just asked if he could explain something to me that I didn’t understand.  Too bad I can’t love the service department at Ford Lincoln of Fairfield too.  ",1.0
1,"June 02, 2019",Was dealing with them for a ford mustang convertible. After giving a written offer on email and making me travel 100miles one side. They refused and said that was not the offer on convertible. Said some other person wrote that price on his name and he didn't knew. When on successive emails he was talking about same. Such a cheaters and liars. Definitely no one should go to buy vehicles from them. They will just waste your time and they don't care. Travelled 2hours to come back without a car. Atleast be genuine in the starting and say the truth . Why wasting customers precious time,1.0
2,"April 26, 2019","Matt is awesome. Very knowledgeable, and friendly. The process was smooth and took less time than expected. The general manager greeted me and my brother and made sure everything was taken care of properly. Do you need a vehicle? Go, visit Matt and everybody else in there. ",5.0

4,"July 24, 2017",I bought my Escape over a year ago and every time I bring the car in for an oil change they treat me like a VIP. It is easy to come in using the Quick Lane and Megan took care of me right away last week. She even remembered me from my last visit. It took very little time and I was back on the road. I didn't mind waiting because I enjoy looking at the cars in the showroom while my car is being serviced. ,5.0
5,"July 17, 2017","We stopped in at our local Fairfield Ford Dealership thinking about trading in our Edge. When we walked in, we were immediately greeted by a friendly sales manager, Bryan Rice. Bryan took his time showing us different models on the lot and listened to what we wanted and needed in a next vehicle. He answered all of our questions and made the buying process smooth and easy. No matter what question or scenario we threw at him, Bryan always had an option for us to consider. Having a selection of options made our final decision easy and clear. He is knowledgeable, trustworthy, and has a great sense of humor. He went above and beyond during our time at the dealership and we will always go back to Bryan Rice in the future. ",5.0

7,"April 14, 2017","Had electrical issues where all in cab controls froze up.  Couldn't even adjust volume of radio or turn on headlights gauges didn't register at all.  Radio stayed on after truck was shut off, so I disconnected power from the battery to reset the computer.  Truck controls came back up fine, but the re was a check engine light on.  I read the code (with my own handheld code reader) but didn't clear it so the service department could advise me, code was P2560, which I believe translates to ""low coolant level"", I checked the coolant level and it was right in the middle between max and min.  So I drove it in to get advise as to whether it was a glitch or actually valid, what should be a 5-15 minute assessment.  The service writer asked if I wanted to leave it or schedule an appointment, I said I wanted an answer as to whether it was an issue or not, the service writer then stated they were really backed up and wouldn't be able to get to it for 4 days, do I want to leave it or schedule an appointment?  Wrong answer.  These guys are clueless and aren't even willing to check with a tech for a simple answer and to reset a code.",1.5
8,"April 02, 2017",My wife and I had been in the market for a used F -250.  I made a call to Fairfield Ford and Brittany answered.   She let me know what she had and we came down.  She had the truck ready for us to take on a test drive.   She was extremely helpful and had a no pressure positive attitude.   After the test drive we sat down and talked price.   She showed us everything and made the experience simple and easy to say yes.   My wife forgot the check book so Brittany followed us home so we didn't have to drive back.   Amazing service and I will absolutely reach out to her for our next need. ,5.0

10,"April 01, 2017"," Recently I was in looking at a new Lincoln MKZ, Brittany was my sales person and she made the process simple and easy. I ordered my  New Lincoln and was given an expectation of three months for delivery, no big deal. To my surprise my car was delivered in a little over 30 days. This was not only extraordinary, but Brittany made sure to keep me in the loop on where my vehicle was in the process and when it would be available to purchase. Very happy Lincoln custimer!!!!

13,"March 30, 2017","My big thing whenever I'm buying something is how I'm treated. Whether it's a big screen TV at Best Buy, food from a restaurant, or a car from a dealership. Customer service is very important. And Benny M makes my family feel like family. Even my two year old likes seeing Benny.

19,"March 14, 2017","My husband and I have been in the market for a truck for about 2 months now.  After extensive research and multiple grueling trips to different dealerships, Ford Lincoln of Fairfield is what caught our attention.  From start to finish the sales people were easy, attentive to our needs, super friendly, and most important empathetic to the fact that we had our 2 1/2 year old daughter with us every time we came in. (My daughter loves their kids playroom) Mark Byrd is the wonderful young salesman who had assisted us in weeding through Ford's huge selection of F150's and was instrumental in helping us come to a final decision.  Even after the sale was all said and done Mark Byrd along with Nikki Rau went above and beyond to address ALL of our needs and concerns in regards to our brand new truck. Much love to Ford Lincoln Fairfield.  When looking into one's ""TRUCKING"" needs this place comes highly recommended in my book!!!! ",5.0

22,"February 26, 2017","I have been interested in purchasing a new car, but I wasn't sure exactly what I wanted other than a family car. I googled different car dealerships and was surprised to see the amount of positive reviews at Fairfield Lincoln Ford. I now know why this dealership has such a good rating. Our salesman, Mark Byrd, was great! He answered all our questions and gave us time to mull over exactly what we wanted and the ""finance guy"", Dwight, really looked for the best interest rate for us. We are very happy that we took a look at Fairfield Ford Lincoln.",5.0

29,"February 16, 2017","I don’t recommend shopping for a vehicle at Ford Lincoln Fairfield to anyone.  Ford Lincoln Fairfield is still unfairly withholding about $7,500 of what I originally used as a Trade In/Down Payment for a vehicle that I had to sell back to them within about 2 months time due to Financial Hardship of which I will be struggling through for quite some time.  They are not legally obligated to return this money so continue to retain it.  It is a moral issue that no consumer should ignore.  If there is a problem with the purchase and you miss the 3 day buy back guarantee, they seem to want to take advantage even when they know it's not right.  At this point and still they do not have my blessing until I am paid the money I feel they owe me.  They are not being fair about this.  Beware.",1.6

You're trying to negotiate the best possible price for the car you want while you feel like the salesperson is trying to extract every last nickel from you. I've walked away from dealerships in the past because of this exact feeling. Well not the case at Ford in Fairfield!! I Was greeted by Mark Byrd who explained the no hassle/ bargain policy.

I really appreciated the standard of total transparency while working with me to find the vehicle that would fit all my needs. 

I engaged with a few other team members during the lengthy time my wife and I were there considering vehicles for sale/lease. All my questions, whether about mechanical or financial aspects were answered in laymen's terms until I had a full understanding.

I was a little nervous about buying a vehicle so far away from home, but Ngawang was very helpful over the phone.  He answered all of my questions about the vehicle and the details about buying from out-of-state.  He also took and sent me a bunch of extra pictures which I requested of certain components of the vehicle.  Ngawang even drove 40 minutes (one way) to the airport to come pick me up when I flew in to complete the sale.

Butt this time was totally different ... I contacted the delearship and got a hold Ngawang. I wa actually interested in a used Ford Fusion energi initially but when we took the used Ford Fusion energi for a test drive, I saw the new one which caught my attention ... Ngawang worked the price with me ... For a moment I thought I was going to have relive those agonizing moments which I had to go thru for all the past four cars I bought .... To my surprise, Ngawang made it so easy for me ... None of the standard car dealership B.S .... He layed out all the option with car and gave a really reasonable price which I was totally happy with but your inner instinct tells you to bargain ... And growing up outside US, we lived every moment of our life with bargaining your way ... So I counter offered with an unreasonable price to which I thought he wa going to react with a standard delearship B.S response .... He actually browsed the web and showed openly compared the price and left it all for me to decide ... Didn't feel an ounce of pressure .... It was the unique and unexpectedly awesome buying experience that made to sealed the deal .... I would highly recommend Ngawang if any of you are interested in buying a ford  ",5.0
82,"July 02, 2016","We've purchased three Fords from this dealership and would come back even if we moved out of the area. The sales people are nice enough but it's really the after purchase customer service that sets them apart. It seems like each time we purchased our car something was going crazy in our lives. Our First Edge we had a 1 year old with napping issues, with our Explorer we unexpectedly gave birth to our twins and had to take possession of the car in the hospital and with our Focus my husband was about to head out of town for work. In each instance the customer service team went above & beyond to help us out. 

In particular we recommend asking for Rosellini at the counter if you need anything. She's always has a smile and even when we were stressed out beyond belief, she managed to reassure us that they would take care of whatever we needed. Whenever we need anything we ask for her by name now. Any hire is a gamble for a company, but they hit the mark on this one. So if you need anything for your Ford, ask for her! ",5.0

Since I was coming from Lodi (about 45 miles away) Brittany wonder the lot taking pics of different Mustang GTs and texting them to me so I could get a better idea of what was available in the inventory.  By the afternoon I knew which Mustang I wanted based on all the info she provided me.  I headed over to Fairfield and by the time I arrived - she had the particular mustang I was interested in parked in front of the dealership.  We went for a quick test drive and I was hooked.  
   I really appreciate all the work Brittany put in to making the deal happen.  I have to say it was the easiest car buying experience I've ever had.  Brittany knew the product and all the financing options available.  She did a great job.

The sales rep who who assisted me with my purchase was Diego Cuevas. We made a little small talk, I told him what I was looking for, gave him my list of ""need to haves"" and he went to work. He checked the inventory on the computer and we quickly headed out to the lot to see what caught my eye. Diego was very patient as I took my time going through a handful of trucks. He answered a ton of questions and I never felt rushed. We test drove a couple different models and I finally decided on a two-tone, White Platinum Metallic F-150 Lariat. The paperwork process was painless and the entire staff was very helpful and friendly throughout.

After the paperwork was wrapped up, Diego took an extra 20 - 30 minutes to sit with me in the truck and go over all the high tech gizmos. He showed me how to set everything up and made sure all my questions were answered before I drove off the lot.

Overall my experience at this dealership was fantastic! I can't say enough how friendly and helpful everyone was. I never felt rushed or pressured at any point during the sales process and their prices are waaaay better than what's available in my area. Well worth the drive.

127,"September 26, 2015","When I first went to this dealership on 9/3/15  I was shocked and ecstatic to be driving a new 2016 Ford Fusion with a payment budget that worked for me and my family. I was amazed that Ford Fairfield gave me $4300 in rebates and traded in my old car  which covered down payments and the first payment.  I am scheduled to make my first payment on October 3.  I was also told that a Lease agreement was a better option for me to help build my credit.

What has since transpired is straight out of a tragic comedy routine and not a good one at that. I was contacted by a Finance Manager (22 days after driving away) by the name of Matt yesterday at 1:30 in the afternoon (an hour before I was scheduled to go to work) and subsequently spoke with the Finance Director Kenny Calderon after several attempts to actually speak with this individual. Their reason for calling was to tell me that funding had fallen through and that I needed to return my new vehicle to their dealership (in fact was demanded to return by Matt), unless I was able to secure a
 co-signer who has more credit than myself or the car will be repossessed. 

How can a car be repossessed when the first payment is not due yet and not late??????

What dealership runs a business like this? Why was funding not secured and in place before I even arrived at this dealership? I did all the online application requirements.  I was assured repeatedly by Adam Herren, the Sales Director (who I had been dealing with before even stepping foot into the dealership) that all was taken care of. I even spoke to him the night before and was told that funding was still all set.

WHAT is the problem up there? Do you have any idea the amount of strife and emotional turmoil and panic that you have placed me and my family through and nobody seems to give a rip up there, all I am told is it's just business!  I am left with no car for my family because our trade in has already been destroyed.  Our family is now faced with having to walk to and from school and work, because we are being threatened to be completely without a car now.

And why was I able to get the car fixed up with ______ and NO ONE said anything to me while I was up there at the dealership then??

We are not getting any real answers from anyone because every time I call and ask for this person or that person that helped me on that first day, I am being told ""they are no longer working here"".....right down to the General Manager!!!   

Am I caught in the middle of something???  

Why am I not even given the opportunity to make a first payment to Ford Credit whom I was told held the lease.  I am left in confusion by all of this.  I don't know what to do, who to talk to or who to trust.

I will never ever recommend this dealer to anyone I know and will be telling everybody not just people I know but everyone that I come into contact with about how this experience at FORD FAIRFIELD was totally life changing in one moment and a Nightmare the next! 

I even did a Yelp review on their behalf and this was the response that I was given:

143,"August 10, 2015","Things started to go downhill after a great experience here. I knew I should have waited a month before posting my first review...

After a week and a half with the car I noticed my so called ""factory tint"" started to peel at my back window. After close inspection, these were not factory tint as my interior had water marks that I had to wipe off. (The marks reappear when you wet them by the way.) So, I had to bring the car in for Jeff Perkins to see. After ""speaking to the manager"" he pointed me to a local window tint shop called Pacific Sound & Protection that did the tints and told me he had no idea that the tints were aftermarket. I know, I should have inspected the vehicle before delivery but I trusted this dealership to know what they are selling. Honestly, I would prefer the tints to be removed and have another place of my choice to install them professionally at the dealership's cost.

Then this week I get a letter from the DMV called ""Notice to Suspend Registration"" on the car that I traded in because DMV says I have no insurance on it. Duh, it's not my car anymore so I transferred my insurance to my new one immediately. Of course calling the DMV with their ""stellar"" customer service didn't help but them pointing fingers at me that it was my fault. So I called Jeff Perkins about the situation. He told me he was going to make a phone call and then just hung up; I'm sitting there going ""hello?"" Since the letter gave me till Sept. 14 I decided to wait on any response. The next day I received an email with a subject ""DMV"" and a message ""Lisa should be calling you today."" I have no idea who sent that email because that message was literally the only thing in the body of that email. Two days passed and I responded to that email that I have not received any phone call what so ever. Then another 24 hours passed till I get a phone call from Lisa who left a voice mail that the Notice of Transfer and Liability was sent on the 27th; a week after I handed over my keys to this dealership. I have a feeling this is not the end of this.

Now, I could have sold my old car and get a better price than what all dealerships would offer. I know that for a fact but I didn't want to deal with the DMV part and obviously I had to deal with it anyways... Now that I read a few of my fellow Yelpers on here it seems this place has DMV issues.

Oh look I just found a bubble on the passenger window tints today, great... 

I still love my Focus ST though...",2.3

148,"July 30, 2015","We just purchased our third Ford (second from Ford Fairfield) and have been very happy with the service we received. For our most recent Explorer purchase we needed to upgrade in size from our Edge and felt like we got a great deal on the exact car we wanted. 

We weren’t really sure what we were looking for but Liz Lomeli and Alex Fisher in the sales department were really helpful and patient with us. They helped us walk through multiple iterations of cars until we found the exact one that suited us. I was really impressed with the way they worked together to help us out. We were pretty scattered and it was tough for us to make up our minds. They kept in great contact with us on our search and even held the car on the lot for us to accommodate our schedules for paperwork signing. 

We’ve purchased 2 cars in 2 years from this dealership and see no reason to go anywhere else. At other dealerships in the area I truly felt that the sales staff expected that we’d done all our research prior to showing up at the dealership and they didn’t need to do anything more than pull up the car we’d pre-selected and get the paperwork ready. We were really pleased that Liz and Alex actually took time to educate us on the different models and options available at Ford. It’s refreshing when the sales staff actually takes their job seriously! 

So short story; ask for them. You can’t go wrong.

Though she was already off work, and had locked up for the night, she reopened for me so I could rent a car. A man named mike offered to keep my car there and have it checked out in the morning.

I was torn between a Toyota, Honda and a Ford. I know they are all great cars but after doing a lot of research I went with a Ford. I went to several Ford dealers and I finally went to Ford Fairfield with my friend after seeing their inventory online. When we walked in the receptionist was friendly and not long after, Maribel introduced herself and assisted us right away. I already knew the car I wanted so she quickly pulled it up and after test-driving it I knew it was the one that I wanted. I brought all of info; pay stubs, a bill, a down-payment etc. She was not pushy/aggressive she was informative and quick she did not waste our time like a lot of others have. She was straight up with us and respected our concerns, questions and decisions. Although I have a decent paying job I have no credit whatsoever so a lot of places tried to take advantage of that and wanted to charge me ridiculous amounts of interest for way too many months. Maribel was understanding, and after taking everything else into consideration she got me a great deal on the car that I really wanted. All and all, Ford Fairfield was a great experience nothing like I’ve had with basically all the other dealerships I’ve been to. I would recommend anyone looking for a Ford to go to Ford Fairfield and definitely ask for Maribel Mata cuz you will be happy that you did.",5.0

This was after I had contacted 5 other Ford dealerships in my area to try and find the vehicle that matched my specs.

168,"June 01, 2015","It is unusual for me to take the time to post a review on the internet about something. Even when the only thing I have to do is click a few boxes I don’t generally go out of my way to express an opinion unless I’m angry with customer service, a product or the company.  This is the rare exception where the motivation for writing a review is not driven by negative emotions.  Rather, this review is driven by an ongoing sense of gratitude and customer satisfaction that is in large part due to Alexander, the young gentleman who assisted me at Fairfield Ford.
I hesitate to call Alexander a “car salesman” because that label would betray the true character of this young man.  It only took a few moments after we met for me to re-evaluate the stereotype I was expecting to encounter.  It was nearly 8:30 in the evening when I stopped in the dealership and Alexander seemed as fresh and eager to help as if it were 10 AM.  His readiness with answers to questions impressed me with his product knowledge and his excitement to show me around enticed me to engage him.
It has been awhile since I considered a Ford and I had no intention of buying anything that evening.  I have been a Dodge man for years now but my 3500 was just too big for the driveway.  However, with Alexander’s expert assistance I found a new F150 Crew that was perfect for my needs.  He walked me through the entire process; I got what I needed for my trade and stunned everyone when I drove home with my new Ford.
If it had ended there I wouldn’t be writing this. The extent to which Alexander and Fairfield Ford have gone to ensure satisfaction with my purchase so many weeks since had made me feel I must write something.  I have returned to the dealership to review some features and they have patiently walked me through everything this truck can do.  Alexander has even reached out since to ask if I am still doing well with the purchase.  I will be back to this dealership again.
Needless to say, I’m a happy customer.

169,"May 31, 2015","I recently visited Ford Fairfield after a friend had told me about the outstanding help and customer service that she recieved from Mark Harlow. I was getting ready to move to Texas but decided to go in and see Mark. From the very first handshake, this young man presented himself with confidence and extreme professionalism. He wasnt the stereotypical car salesman that tries to push you into a purchase but instead took the time to get to know me as a person before we even talked business. Over the next 2 or 3 days we ran into a few snags but Mark was determined to do everything he could to help me out. Through the whole process Mark clearly demonstrated an impressive amount of knowledge, honesty, and dedication. The thing that appealed to me was that Mark's dedication was to me as the customer, he really took the time to listen and dedicated his time, even after hours to getting me what I wanted. This says alot about Mark and the person that made the decision to bring him on the Ford Fairfield Team. Because of Mark's outstanding and unmatched professionalism, customer service, and knowledge of his job, I ended up purchasing the truck I had been wanting for quite sometime instead of waiting until I arrived in Texas. Since then, Mark has contacted me numerous times to not only follow up on the purchase but to follow up on me personally and how my family is doing. I can't say enough about Mark Harlow but if younare looking for a relaxed but satisfying experience when looking for your next vehicle, please go visit Mark Harlow and his team at Ford Fairfield...you won't be disappointed.

177,"May 11, 2015","I bought my car from Ford Fairfield. The buying process was excellent, they didn't pressure you, they gave you time, and it was easy. However when I started having mechanical issues with my car, thats where the problems started. I use my car every day to drive to work, and i bought a new car so i wouldn't have to worry about not having a car. So I took my car in, and it was going to be in the shop for at least 3 days. They told me that a loaner car was not available because they don't do that. I had bought the car less than 6 months ago and they were going to leave me without a car after buying a brand new one. I fought for nearly an hour with the service advisers before they finally caved in to give me a loaner car. They had the car for 10 days, then after getting it back, less than two weeks later I lost my electric steering and had to take it back. I lost the steering due to them failing to put a ground wire back on properly. Again, I had to fight for a loaner car to get to work. 

Less than two months later i had the same problem with the ticking. I took it back to Ford Fairfield. This time they would not allow me to have a rental car or a loaner, even after fighting them, so I will no longer give them my service.


After buying a brand new car from them, they were not willing to give me a loaner car, which i believe is bull crap. I would never suggest this dealership to anybody!",1.8

187,"April 17, 2015","I was looking for a new vehicle and after looking online found a specific car in Ford Fairfield's inventory that I was interested in.  So I stopped in, checked out the car and then received an estimate for the value of my trade-in.  I was happy with the amount they wanted to give me for my trade-in, and the discount off the retail price of the new car was fine, but I wanted a little more off the price of the new car.  I was told be the sales person that Ford Fairfield doesn't ""haggle"" on the price.  Well, I like to ""haggle"" a little bit so I didn't think it was a good enough deal so I left and took with me a copy of the offer, which a sales person asked me if I would like to keep.  So I went to another Ford dealer, showed them the offer from Ford Fairfield, and asked them if they could beat the deal by, maybe $2000 for a similar vehicle in their inventory.  They took the offer in the back room, took a look at my trade-in, and then a Sales Manager came out to talk to me.  He said the he couldn't even come close to giving me the same money for my trade-in that Ford Fairfield was willing to give me.  As a result, the vehicle at the second Ford dealer would cost me about $3000 more than I could have paid for the car I really wanted at Ford Faifrfield.  Great.  The Sales Manager said he had 1 question for me: Why didn't I buy the car with the offer from Fairfield?  So I asked "" So the Ford Fairfield offer was a good deal?""  And he said ""Yes"".  So what to do now?  I decided to suck it up and go back to Ford Fairfield and ask if the offer was still on the table.  They said ""Sure"".  So I bought my car there and I love it.  The sales people were really nice at Fairfield - B.J., and Tristen.  I liked how they never sent a Sales Manager over to work me over or anything.  And then Kirsten walked me through the whole process, even addressing all my picky concerns like what kind of gas she would fill up my new car with.  Kirsten even stayed about an hour past closing to show me the features on my new vehicle.  She was great.  And Sean in finance was amazing.

My Husband and I casually walked into the building and were greeted by Alex in a very friendly and casual manor.  We have purchased 2 cars from him in the last two months.  The first car we purchased was a 2015 Ford Fiesta for our company to be used by our Project Manager.  We didn't need to haggle over price.  It was fair and the financing was acceptable.  The second car we purchased was a used car for our daughter.   There was a little scuff on the rear bumper that was repaired by Ford Fairfield without us requesting the repair.  Overall our experience with Alex and Ford Fairfield has been easy and very professional.  My Husband felt good about the transactions and said ""Funny, I don't feel dirty after making these deals"".   Thank you Alex!

Matt hooked it up with everything I needed and gave me a ride to a neighboring dealership to drop off my old car. I can't really think of anything negative, which is rare when buying cars.

214,"February 23, 2015","I have never written a review before.   But my experience was so good, i had to.
This was my best car buying experience in my 25 years of buying cars.  even better than when I bought my previous and first Ford F150 at Hilltop Ford.  Fairfield Ford by far was my best experience.  I had been through a terrible accident totaling my favorite F150.  the next day I went to a couple of dealerships and then went to Fairfield ford just to start to look since I didn't have too much time to waste and feel sorry for my self after what happened in the accident.  Ken helped me that day and was very nice to deal with - with no cheezy pressure etc.  But I still had stuff to deal with regarding the insurance and mess in the accident in which my poor dog did not survive but by the grace of god...I did.  I rolled my ford f150 4 1/2 times - and that ford saved my life!!
so I promised I would stay in though and come back the following weekend.  I had very specific needs as to what I wanted and he did stay in touch and said he might have a couple of trucks that met my needs.  I also stayed in touch with him and let him know I would be back up to see if we could make something work - while I also checked out a couple of other options.
Ken was not able to make it and had his associate BJ call me from his personal cell and said that ken can't make the appointment but told me about what you went through and wanted to reassure me that he would take good care of me.

so Saturday came - and I went up and met BJ for the first time.   He was a total Gem.  a quirky, friendly, bundle of talent with more knowledge than I initially gave him credit for.  I worked in sales for many years and now own my own company.  I would be lucky to find a young man like BJ.  He never got rattled.  Never got cheezy or dishonest.  he was a solid as Sears and had good integrity.  I also met and dealt with Christian - the big corn fella with a heart of gold and a great personality.  my three kids were with me as well and both BJ and Christian hit it off with my kids and by the end of the day after being there for maybe 5 hours total - it all felt like one big family.


BJ is fantastic, creative, really talented and interesting....and honest.  no pressure.  just there to be of service and help you.  was super patient with us as we were super picky.  He even took me on extra long test rides knowing how important certain aspects were to me to really compare the different trucks I was comparing.

Christian - is like the big old by friendly teady bear that could probably squish you since he is looks like an ex pro football player.  he even looked at my previous contract from hilltop ford and noticed that I can get money back on an extra package that I had purchased and did not get to use since I had totaled my vehicle after only about a year and a half of driving it.  he didn't have to do that, and we appreciated his looking out for us.

Thanks again guys,

Can't wait to visit you guys again next time we come in to get an oil change or something.  I think I am going to supprise them by bringing the staff some doughnuts or something.  they were all super nice.
sincerely,

I had done business previously with Green Valley Ford in Fairfield and always received good sales and service.  About three years ago I went to the new dealership, Ford Lincoln Fairfield, about an estimate for a major repair to my Mercury Sable.  The service writer was TOO busy to help me but promised he would get back to me with an estimate.  He did not so I called him a couple of days later.  Again, the service writer promised but did not follow through.  It was then that I vowed not to return to the Fairfield dealership.  But then, earlier this week, I decided to give the dealership another try.  Fortunately for me, Jeff approached me on the showroom floor.  He was cordial and not at all ""pushy.""  He asked how he could help me and I told him I was looking for a Ford Fusion.  The rest is history.

In the C-Max Energi I could get a sometimes electric car.  The other Ford dealers I visited were the stereotype of the high pressure car dealer.  It is a game I do not play well, and I always feel I lose.  I had decided to work with a car buying service to avoid these haggling problems.  Using the buying service was going okay, but not great.  I had seen on the internet that Ford Lincoln Fairfield had some C-Max's in stock, so on a trip past them I stopped.  There were a couple of models which looked promising, so I went in.  Benny Maldonado met me, he was helpful, respectful, with no high pressure, and no games (""talk to the manager"", ""what price will get you to buy today"" - none of that BS).  The price he offered was reasonable, on a vehicle with the options I wanted.  I thought about it overnight.  I returned the next day to arrange the purchase.  My financing was not in place, so I needed to wait almost a week to take delivery.
I live in Rocklin, CA, which is about 65 miles from Fairfield.  So this is not convenient for me.  But the good customer treatment is worth the inconvenience.  Sorry to say I will not have much servicing done there as it will not work out well for routine service.

266,"December 08, 2014","I started looking for this car in April of this year. Every dealership was asking way over MSRP for them because of the limited production. In 2012 I bought my 2012 Boss 302 from Fairfield Ford. My salesman was Devin Abel, he was great to work with and gave me a great deal. There are at least 12 dealership closer to where I live than Fairfield ford is and I called them all. I decided to call Fairfield Ford and see if Devin was still working there. He told me it was still to early to order one and said he would stay in contact till that time . I was still calling other dealerships trying to find a deal. When the ordering banks opened up on 5/20/2014 I got numerous calls from dealerships. I called Devon and he told me to come in and we could order my car. I ordered it that day and got a far better deal than any other dealership, by a substantial amount. When the car came in because every dealership was marking it way up Fairfield Fords management thought I should pay fair market value. I didn't think that was right and Devin fought for me until I got the price I was originally quoted. Devin kept me up to date through out the whole process and was professional, honest and loyal. Two great cars and to great deals, I know when the time comes for my next vehicle I will defiantly will call Devin.
Thanks for the great deal.

267,"December 07, 2014","Well, Bryan has helped us with our new F150 Limited. We didn't even consider the vehicle because we thought it was well above our budget. However, Bryan Rice figured out a way to get the deal done within our budget! Now we're driving a $56k truck with all the goodies, safety features and color choice that we wanted. Bryan deserves a metal for his efforts as it took us two months to get everything in order. Bryan was patient with us and waited until we could get the right deal done - he didn't push us to make a move and was cordial every time we spoke (about once a week!). Finally we were able to get the perfect deal done and now we have the nicest truck Ford makes in the driveway. Thanks Bryan, you move mountains for your customers. ",5.0
268,"December 07, 2014","Even though the Sacramento area has a number of Ford dealerships, we chose Fairfield Ford/Lincoln some 40 miles away.
Based on a very positive experience 2 years ago when we got our 2013 Ford Fusion, we returned to the dealership because of our sales representative, Devin Abel.  We even brought a friend of ours to meet him so he too can experience the same quality relation Mr. Abel developed with us.  
We got a fantastic deal on our 2015 Lincoln MK-C.
The dealership is beautiful and allows the sales staff to work the deals, not like many other dealers.

Our experience was so good this time again, we also ordered our 2015 Ford Mustang from Devin Abel.",5.0
269,"December 06, 2014","Bryan Rice has sold us another F150. I purchased a 2014 XLT F150 from Bryan a few months ago and decided that I wanted to upgrade a bit to the Limited F150. They bought my recently purchased F150 for an extremely fair price and got me in the Limited for way less than I had thought was possible! I was also hoping to get an extra care service for my lease and they gave it to me at 66% off the retail price. Also threw in a  brand new bedliner to get the deal done. Bryan, once again, went above and beyond to get this done. It took me about 10 weeks to agree on a deal and Bryan stayed patient for the entire length of time. Never once did he pressure me to buy and never once did I feel like I should waiver on my exact wants. Really impressed with Bryan Rice, he doesn't act like he's ""selling a unit"", he acts like he is selling us a new member of the family. Bryan was able to give me the fun facts of the truck, like the 420 torque and he was able to tell my fiance about the rear inflatable seatbelts and other safety features. Fairfield Ford is lucky to have and we are lucky to know such a strong salesman! Keep up the hard work Bryan, it pays off!",5.0
270,"December 05, 2014","Fairfield ford was one of the better Ford  dealers that I visited. The sales department was friendly and non-pushy. Alexander Fisher and Courenew Rasmusson were very easy to deal with. They made me and my family feel very welcomed. I would definitely do busin essence with them again.
My only concerns are, I still have not received a call about the second key I ordered. Also that when I first looked at the car I was told it was a certified pre-owned car and when I purchased the car themail certified pre-owned title was removed.  ",4.2
271,"December 03, 2014","After shopping around and doing a lot of research I found a few vehicles that I was interested in test driving at Ford Lincoln Fairfield.  The price and selection was better than anywhere else I went to or found on-line.  Bob Martin was friendly, helpful, and went above what was necessary to assist me.  He was knowledgeable about the models of vehicles that I test drove, even though they were not Fords.  He insisted on coming in on his day off to ensure that my needs were met on the day of pick up.  I would highly recommend this dealership and Bob to anyone buying a car.  I have purchased over 10 vehicles in my lifetime and this was without a doubt one of the best experiences I've ever had!",4.6

273,"November 30, 2014","This was truly an amazing car buying experience. I came all the way from San Jose when I saw a used (2014) listing for a Ford Explorer Limited with an amazing price and low miles. This truly was the most competitive price around the entire Bay Area for what what was being offered so I figured it would be worth the 80 mile drive. I called the night before and made an appointment with Maribel for 11am the next day (Monday, 11/24/2014). Here is where the experience was already starting to set itself apart: After I made my appointment, Maribel texted me to confirm and asked if I had any questions. I loved that she didn't call me. I know that sounds weird but nothing turns me off more about the car buying experience then dealing with pushy sales calls. We proceeded to text back and forth and she was very responsive to all of my questions. 

When I got there for my appointment the next day, she pulled the vehicle around and gave me all of the facts regarding the vehicle with zero pressure. I think she could sense that there was something that just wasn't cutting it for me regarding this particular vehicle but she didn't push. She just allowed me to ask questions. In the end, I asked her if there was a way to purchase a brand new Ford Explorer within my budget that had everything that I liked about the Limited in this particular model but also included extras that I felt were lacking in this particular vehicle. Though she didn't commit to anything on the spot, she suggested that it might be possible considering certain incentives they had going at the time. In the end, she put me in a beautiful brand new 2015 Ford Explorer XLT with the Sports package which offered everything I was looking for (and more). The price was amazing, the customer service was amazing, and the low pressure sales experience will be what gets her referrals from me. All car dealer sales representatives should emulate Maribel. She truly is amazing! 

I'd also like to add that the rep that helped me in the Finance department was also really great! I came in with my own financing and he was able to get me a very attractive finance package with another lender. He also didn't do a hard up-sell at the finance desk which generally happens at most dealerships and for that, I am also very appreciative. All in all, this experience was fantastic and it has made me a true loyal fan of Ford in Fairfield. I would happily do the long drive all over again to do it again. Oh speaking of which, I forgot to mention that since I drove in and didn't have another adult with me, they had a representative drive my new car to my house 80 miles south so I could have it the same day. Now that's service!  Thank you!!",5.0

When we arrived here we were immediately welcomed and shown exactly what we wanted and all the salesman made us feel welcome. All the salesman cracked jokes with us and gave us absolutely no pressure whatsoever. That's what really sold us, we were able to ask our questions, take our time and get everyone's personal opinion without anyone saying ""you have to buy this car!"" Ron Tilson walked us through every car and every option and gave us a sweet deal. We were so happy with our experience that we ended up coming back 6 months later to trade up to a brand new truck. Same great experience and everyone even remembered us and were happy to see us back! We got an amazing deal we couldn't have been happier with the personal experience and the financial deal because you can't find that anywhere else. ",5.0

Second service they took the fuel filter out instead of the oil filter. They also left a double gasket on the oil filter. Third time they serviced the transmission and left something loose and it leaked all over. Had to bring it in twice to fix this problem. Fourth time they only changed one of the 2 filters and were going to roll it out charging me for changing 2 filters when they changed one.

363,"September 03, 2014","I purchased a brand new 2014 Ford F-150 FX4 and got a great deal.  The experience was great in the beginning, but then it all started bad when I had to come back at 400 miles with a broken Navigation and Bluetooth.  My audio module in the truck was bad so the service department at Ford Fairfield fixed it and I never had the problem again.  I only had the truck for 2 days and had to give it back to them for 4 days so they could repair a brand new truck.

I didn't start having problems with the truck again until at 4600 miles my check engine light turned on and my truck was accelerating poorly.  I then had to race home from work and take it to another Ford Service in Novato.  They determined after plugging into their computer that multiple codes came up that related to the wiring in the car.  After having the truck for the next couple days, they determined it was a loose harness so they took apart all the wiring, checked the connectors and then put it all back together.  They then drove the car for 90 miles and released it to me saying no errors came up when plugging the truck back into the computer.  I then drove it for another 500 miles and three days later the same problem occurred.  I then drove the truck up to Ford Fairfield where the service department is now trying to figure out what is wrong with it.  

I brought these problems to sales at 400 miles and 4600 miles where I told them I wanted a new truck because this truck was already having so many problems.  They proceeded to work with me but concluded that they couldn't help me any further and I would have to take it up with Ford.  They attempted to run some numbers on getting a new truck for me and buying my current truck back but told me the value had dropped on the truck.  This would, therefore, increase my payments to almost double paying for the same truck with no problems.  I said I was not going to do that and we would have to work it out.  They were nice enough to give me a loner truck for the time being but forgot to mention it was a 2 day loner.   After the 2 days was up, I was told by the salesman that sold me the truck they couldn't work with me on getting me a new, safe, working truck.  He  also proceeded to tell me he needed the loner back and I proceeded to tell him that I work in Dublin and had no way to get the truck back until the coming weekend.  I was then told they could report it stolen if I didn't return it and I told him to help me out because there was no way for me to get it back.  I eventually got this matter worked out with a manager who was able to get two drivers to pick it up no questions asked and apologized for the experience.

To sum this all up, the buying experience at Ford Fairfield after I started having problems was absolutely HORRIBLE and I would never buy a truck or car from this dealership ever again.  I know it was not their fault that the truck they sold me was having all these problems, but as a dealer you are supposed to keep your client happy and help them out anyway you can.  I have been told constantly by sales at Ford Fairfield that they can’t help me, but in order to keep a client you have to help them when there is a problem any way you can and not dismiss them.  Unfortunately, this didn’t happen and I will never go back to Ford Fairfield to purchase a Ford product.

The only dealer that had what I wanted (they actually had 3 of them) was Ford Lincoln Fairfield.  They had an excellent, no-haggle price; and I qualified for two rebates also.  Problem was I'm about 3 hours from them, and my wife was still suffering from a broken arm she suffered on Fathers Day and told me she couldn't make the ride up and then have to drive her car back, due to the pain she was still in.  I went ahead and made contact with them via the web, and within a very short time received a phone call from Michelle Domingo, who works in Direct Sales.  I told Michelle my ""co-pilot"" was on the injured list and she told me ""oh, no problem, we can deliver the car to you!""  I inquired about the cost of doing that and she said there was no charge and they do it all the time.  I nearly fell out of my chair!  Later, I received a call from Taurus Hamilton, with whom I completed the rest of the process; and whom delivered the vehicle to me a couple of days later.  The helpfulness and professionalism of both these folks went way beyond what I have come to expect when buying a vehicle, and is very much appreciated.  They obviously care about their customers, which is vital to an organization's success.  I will be recommending Ford Lincoln Fairfield to anyone I run into who is looking for a Ford product.

My mother in Redwood City wanted to lease a Ford Fusion, but she was unable to get to a local dealership, so my husband and I decided to visit Ford Lincoln of Fairfield.  Brittany took pictures of the car, quoted us monthly rates, and even offered to deliver the car once leased and approved directly to my Mom in Redwood City.  What could be easier?  All this information was shared with us within an hour's visit to the Fairfield dealership.  Minutes after leaving, i called my Mm, and she trusted our judgment enough to close the deal with Brittney.

What exceptional door to door customer service!  

Brittney Bogacki is the BEST!

396,"August 15, 2014","I found a car on the internet that was similar to what we were looking for. I gave Aaron a call to discuss the car. He was at another dealership helping out and I can tell he was busy, but he gladly stayed on the phone to talk things over about the vehicle and pulled up all the information for me. He told me someone from his team would call me back. Tiffany called me back a short time later and we discussed the vehicle further. If Tiffany said she was going to call, text or email me in 10 minutes, she did it in 5 minutes. I wish she worked for me! 6 or 7 phone calls later (sorry Tiffany) I was ready  to look at the car. Here is where it gets good. I had to drive 2 hours to see this car and if I wanted to try and have a local dealer trade it, it would have been $2000 more. I did wan't the car and luckily I have driven them before. I didn't even ask, Tiffany offered to drive the car down for me to look at and bring all the paperwork with her. I Asked, ""What if I don't like the car or my wife doesn't like it."" Her answer was ""Then i'll get back in the car and drive it back."" The bottom line is, could I have bought the car for $200 or $300 less? Maybe if I had 8 hours to haggle and wanted to walk out 3 or 4 times (I have bought 3 new cars this way before, it is fun sometimes). Could I have bought the car for $1000 or $2000 less? Absolutely not. The pricing was great and the people I dealt with were up front, honest and didn't put on an act.

Lastly, Christian figured out how to keep the process to just a little over an hour and valued my trade in  for almost what I paid for it a year ago.

Over the weekend I caught myself browsing for a new car at this dealership. I know I'm not quite ready to commit but in the next month or so I will be. So, I stopped in to check out the inventory. I was approached by a very professional young man. His name is Daron. He answered all of the many questions I had and some concerns. He did it with such patience and clear clarifications. He didn't harass me to commit to something I wasn't sure about. But he definitely led me to want to come back and get my new car from here. Daron is very passionate of the nature of his work and was very knowledge of the products of which he is selling. I commend him for that. Some sales people try to push you to buy anything for commission. But he is more compassionate and only offered options from what he felt would fit my lifestyle.

465,"June 27, 2014","Overall I felt that I got a great deal with great customer service. The reason I don't give it a great experience is the following:

1) The advertised and posted price was 19900+/-. However, after I said I wanted the car, the price increased $1600 +/- because the seats were aftermarket leather. When I was told that I would have to pay additional money I was prepared to not buy the car, however, Bryan went back to the manager when he saw I was upset by the change in price. He then came back and said that the dealer would honor the advertised price. 

2) When I went to pay for the car:
- the price I was quoted was not accurate. I was quoted a price that did not match the final price. That happened because the salesperson did not calculate the tax properly and that added $400 + to the price of the car out the door.
- the extended warranty was automatically added to the final price without discussing that with me in advanced. I had to find that detail and get it changed from the final price.

3) The leather seats in the back were stained. It required that the car go back to the detailer so this could be addressed. There was absolutely no problem getting this resolved. However, it made me feel like I had to check the car for other problems so I wouldn't find them after the sale.

4) The car was delivered with the warning light on for tires being under pressure. As a new owner I had no idea why I had a warning light showing up on a new car, so it would have been helpful to have that resolved before I took the car. 

The good news is I love the C-Max! A couple of final good things:

1) Bryan has been responsive, communicative and helpful both at the time of the final sale, as well as throughout the week following the sale. He has quickly answered my emails and phone calls and made sure I knew when I would be getting my vehicle and the status of the repair and installation of my sunroof.
2) Everyone at the dealership was welcoming and friendly.
3) The drivers who delivered the car were on time and very helpful.

478,"June 14, 2014","I had spent several weeks looking online for a new 2014 Mustang GT with a manual transmission. Where I live, summer temperatures make leather seats very impractical, so my ideal vehicle was a ""bare-bones"" GT in any color other than the ill-named ""Gotta Have it Green.""

My search eventually led me to Michelle Domingo at Fairfield Ford. Michelle made it a personal mission to find the right vehicle. She and Allie Maddux also worked with me to obtain a fair price for two vehicles that I planned to trade in on a new car.

Finding exactly the right car was a challenge -- I assume Ford assembly plants had already shut down production of the 2014 Mustang -- as dealer inventories appeared to be rather sparse. Michelle eventually found the perfect vehicle at another dealer and arranged to have it delivered to Fairfield. She worked tirelessly for several days and then drove the new car to my home in the Sierra foothills.

Everyone I worked with at Fairfield Ford was friendly and courteous. Michelle and Allie were especially helpful.",5.0

491,"June 01, 2014","My experience with Fairfield Ford was a huge roller coaster ride.  First, my experience with salesman Matt Swoyer was and still is amazing.  Matt is extremely knowledgeable and his post sales communication is the best I have ever had.  After the purchase I had a manufacturing problem (more on that below) and Matt was in constant communication with me, followed up with service for me, went to management and fought on my behalf to 'make it right'.  Whenever I would show up in service, he would always come over to say hello and find out if there is anything else that he could do to help.  Fairfield Ford has an amazing sales person in Matt, they will be lucky if they can keep him.

Now for the lows.  I ordered the 2014 Explorer Sport 2/9/14 with all the features we wanted.  It took 8 weeks to arrive which is exactly how long we were told it would take.  The night it arrived (4/8/14) we rushed down to Ford to pick it up, test drove it, signed the docs and took it home.  The very next morning on my way to work, the Explorer lost almost all power as I was accelerating onto the freeway and had just made it to the fast lane.  Engine light was flashing, barely made it back to the slow lane and limped it to my exit a few miles away.  I took it back to Fairfield Ford less than 24 hours after I picked it up and they put me in a loaner.  Then service we went through 44 days of trial and error replacing various parts, catalytic converter (had to order twice as wrong part was ordered), fuel injectors, PCM module and fuel management wiring harness.  None of these repairs have any effect on the problem.  While the vehicle was at Fairfield Ford, the front windshield had to be replaced as a rock from nearby highway 12 supposedly flew over and broke the windshield.  Service replaced the windshield.  More on why this was important in a second. 

By now my first payment is due, so I get the paperwork going to open a lemon law case with Ford.  I get a very rude lady on the other end of the phone that opens my case and tells me that my case worker will contact me within 15 business days. As of this writing, my case is still pending and I have not been contacted once by my case manager, but it has only been 10 business days, so we will see.  

I received a call (5/23/14) from Bruce Masters (service) stating that they replaced an aluminum fuel distribution tube.  He said that there must have been a manufacturing defect on the aluminum fuel distribution tube.  After they replaced this part the vehicle was running good again.

I pickup the vehicle the next day (5/24/14) and drove it to Vacaville and back, approximately 30 miles.  On my way back, the exterior pillar trim molding (piece that covers from the edge of the front windshield to the passenger door) flies off the Explorer, luckily misses everyone and slides off the road.  I take it back to Fairfield Ford and they put me back in the loaner.  Still I have had the vehicle less than 24 hours and already made a payment.  I asked that Adam Simms, owner of Fairfield Ford to contact me about my experience and to this date he has not.  Dissapointing that an owner does not have time or curtesy to contact one of his customers.  I reached out to both Fairfield Ford and Mercedes of Fairfield (I am a customer of both now) asking that Adam Simms contact me about this situation and have not recieved a single call from him.

Bruce Masters orders the pillar trim molding piece and replaces it in a couple days.  I pickup the Explorer and make it no more than 2 miles from Fairfield Ford when the new pillar molding flies off again for the second time.  Suffice it to say that this is WAY past the point of being humorous.  I take it back immediately to the dealership and back in the loaner.  Now payment number 2 is coming up due soon.  Bruce orders all the parts for the pillar post this time, all connectors and brackets.  He assured me that it was test driven at least 30 miles and ran through the carwash to make sure the piece would not come off again.  It has now been 24 hours since I have physically had the Explorer, so we will see.  Hopefully it will all hold together and run correctly now.   Oh one last thing, when I picked up the Explorer this last time, the vehicle had 310 miles on it and an empty tank of gas.  Thank you Fairfield Ford... 

My advice, buy from Matt Swoyer as he is on top of everything that he has control of, but be very cautious using Fairfield Ford service department.",3.6

497,"May 31, 2014","I first contacted Ford Lincoln Fairfield in August 2013. At the time, I was weighing several options, and hesitant after an extremely negative experience at a Honda dealership. In the first five minutes speaking with Taurus, and over the next seven months, he convinced me that he was focused on the acquiring and retaining a lasting customer relationship. Taurus advised me to take my time to make a decision, whether or not that decision would result in me doing business with Ford Lincoln Fairfield or another dealership. So, in March 2014 when I finally decided to purchase a vehicle, Taurus and Ford Lincoln Fairfield were my first (and only) stop. I was immediately greeted as I stepped out of my car; not with salesman pressure, but with a welcome that told me I was in the right place with partners who would do the right thing for me. Taurus was patient, and took the time to understand my needs from trade-in value to budget to need-to-have to want-to-have. He worked with the Sales and Finance team to put together options for me to choose from, and assured that I understood that at any moment I could get up and walk away. I had my heart and mind set on a 2014 black Ford Edge, but my credit and trade-in put constraints on making that deal. I was disappointed, but Taurus encouraged me to take a look at Ford Lincoln Fairfield's certified used inventory. He took me to the lot and showed me five possibilities to get me thinking. One of the options was a 2013 black Ford Edge, but he cautioned me to look at several purchase points across all the vehicles (e.g. mileage, package, cost). He also encouraged me to test drive. Considering all the purchase points, when I opened the door of the 2013 black Ford Edge, I was immediately sold. I had not told Taurus that my dream car needed to have black leather with red stitching, and that in his effort to do the right thing for me he had guided me to my dream. Taurus stayed with me through the finance and closing stages, and delivered the vehicle. I haven't covered everything in my review, but if you're in the Ford Lincoln Fairfield area, and whether or not you are window-shopping, thinking, or ready, stop by and see Taurus. Have a conversation, experience service excellence. I feel like everything is possible every time I get into my new car. Thanks, Taurus! Thanks, Ford Lincoln Fairfield!",5.0

I received a phone call within minutes after submitting an inquiry online, which is the reason I purchased this car the same day.  Other dealerships did not call me back until after 5 pm., by that time I had already finalized the deal with Ford Lincoln Fairfield.  

Sonja called me, found out what exactly I was looking for and called me back within the hour.  She emailed me all the info for the vehicles that she found for me.  Although I lived about 40 miles away from this dealership, I was there within a couple of hours to meet with her.  On our way there I was very nervous about going to a dealership to purchase a car because I've never had a memorable experience.  From applying for the loan to choosing the right car, Sonja really put us at ease.  She was professional and understanding of our situation.  The vehicle that we wanted was located in Marin, although she told me she was off at 6pm, she never hesitated to drive to Marin to pick up the car so that we could drive home with our new car the same day…must’ve been around 9 pm when everything was finalized.

Being a manager in sales/service myself, I really appreciate the great experience that Sonja gave us.  When she asked me to do a survey for her, I did not hesitate.  What a wonderful experience we had, and would definitely recommend this dealership to friends and family.

I told him up front that I was not looking to buy today or even in the next 2 to 3 month, didn't seem to put him off one bit.

531,"April 25, 2014","Have had mostly negative experiences with the Service Dept.  After getting home I found my computer was not reset.  A few days later I had to refill the window washer fluid as it was not done at time of service.  Tires were under inflated causing warning to appear on the dashboard.  I though transmission was making a clunking noise and service told me they reset the computer control on the transmission.  Did not help.  Took it to another Ford dealer and was told the problem was actually with the driveshaft and Ford had issued a bulletin to dealers making them aware of the problem and providing a fix for this problem.  

This was my first new car buying experience and over time I found that the salesman misled me in several areas.  Unfortunately for me, I didn't know all the right questions to ask.  Live and learn.",2.5
532,"April 25, 2014","My husband and I spent several days in search of a vehicle. It was tiresome and frustrating and I walked into Ford Lincoln Fairfield with what I would classify as a sour attitude. I have to say, immediately upon meeting Michelle Domingo she turned my car search experience around. She really cares about getting you and your family into the right vehicle to best suit your needs. She's honest and straight forward. My husband and I ended up with another vehicle a Mini Van, a product that Ford doesn't offer at this time in the end. But, Ms. Domingo was an amazing sales person and I would recommend her and the dealership to anyone in search of a New Ford. Thanks so much Michelle! ",5.0

Sonja guided me through the pre-qualification process which made being at the dealership alot easier than I expected. Paperwork was quick and trade-in was smooth. 
Both individuals were a pleasure to work with as they were professional, friendly & courteous. 
I would recommend Bryan and Sonja for anyone looking to purchase a new or used vehicle and to be shown the true definition of quality customer service. Additionally, Sonja has inquired to make sure everything was going well with the car. I appreciate the follow-up.
For any future purchases, Ford of Fairfield has my vote for a satisfied customer that will definitely be returning.

My wife narrowed down her search and noticed Fairfield Ford had one of the cars she wanted, only problem? It  was Friday at 7:30 pm and we were 70 miles away. She spoke with Tiffany and arranged a visit that same night and we got there barely before closing. Not only did we get a unrushed test drive, but everyone made us feel right at home. The price was a no haggling affair and it was one of the lowest online quotes based on the mileage and features of the car. Our trade was right in the middle between low estimate and high estimate which I also thought was reasonable. The entire staff was friendly, never made us feel like we were infringing on their night, and offered to buy our trade whether we wanted the Honda or not. More dealerships should follow this model-they do whatever is necessary to get the job done. Sincere thanks! We are already enjoying the car, it was a great purchase!",5.0
539,"April 19, 2014","I received excellent service when I leased a Fusion 3 years ago and always had Ford Fairfield as #1 choice when I was ready to buy and this time was no different. First Sonya was amazing at getting back to me and giving me plenty of options and when my lease was up - I was ready to buy. I was Ford Fairfield's customer to lose. I was looking at the F-150, as well as comparable trucks from other makers. The day I came in to give back the Fusion I met Matt and he was very friendly and patient. That combination worked and I left there with a new 2014 F-150 and I believe both parties were very happy. I know this party continues to be happy every time I pass a certain F-150 sitting in my driveway.

Thank you to Sonya and Matt for their dedication and hard work - I would definitely recommend a friend or family member to Ford Lincoln Fairfield. Now you should put on a class to teach these other dealerships how you do business - there is a reason you are successful and it all starts with the First Impression !

After shopping around some on-line and in-person (Paul Blanco, Oakland, and Concord Toyota), I came across the Camry I ended up purchasing from Fairfield Ford. Nikhil listened to my needs over the phone when I called asking about the car I found on-line and confirmed he still had it in inventory (my car was still in ""holding""). He listened to my financing concerns, and of course what my monthly budget could afford. I was pleased to find the car exactly as he described it once I arrived and went to work on the paperwork, etc...With computer system issues at the dealership and within the network, Nikhil personally ended up coming to my home in Concord to finalize the paperwork so I would not have to go back and forth.

556,"April 14, 2014","My husband & I knew we needed to get a newer vehicle but, our fears & skepticism of any honest, non-pressuring, fair salespeople even existing, prevented us from beginning the process. Then we were referred to Sonja Farias at Ford Fairfield and oh how a small conversation on the phone changed our way of thinking. I called Sonja and expressed the kind of vehicle we were interested in, what we had to work with...financially and that we had a bankruptcy. She reassured me that the bankruptcy wouldn't be an issue and that she would work to secure a loan with reasonable rates and affordable pymnts. Within a few hrs and after our conversation, via texts, Sonja had found the vehicle of our DREAMS and secured a loan with great rates, no money down & pymnts that won't break our bank account. Not only did Sonja go that extra mile to get the best rates.......she literally went the extra mile delivering our car herself. Sonja's sunny personality and no-pressure sales approach has made us life-long customers. 
We look forward to making our next car purchase for my husband.....as well as our daughters' first car purchases. Sonja Farias truly puts the FAIR in Ford Fairfield! I will highly recommend her and the dealership to all my family & friends.

It's a great little car!  I'm proud and happy to be driving a FORD!

The service department is always polite, they're right there waiting to take my keys and move my car to the next station before I've even put it into park!  Every person on the lot is friendly and helpful and polite!  The facility is clean and hospitable so I don't mind sitting there if I have to wait.

611,"March 14, 2014","We bought a used 2006 F250 Turbo Diesel pick-up at Ford Lincoln Fairfield last week and we couldn't be happier with our experience. This is how car shopping should be!

We were in the market for a diesel pick-up for several weeks now and I saw one in an online ad by Ford Fairfield that seemed to be a good fit for our needs and budget.  Upon my email inquiry, one of their internet sales reps - Sonja Farias - promptly replied. We exchanged a few more messages during which she patiently answered all my questions, before my wife and I were able to make the 85 mile drive from Auburn to Fairfield.  

Sonja was expecting us when we got there. She showed us the truck in question and took us on a test drive on the freeway and on some smaller roads taking us back to Ford Fairfield. Everything looked good and we were still interested.  This dealership has a no-haggle pricing policy and the price was a little more what we initially wanted to spend. But based on my prior research I knew that it was still quite competitive. And the financing conditions were much better than anything else I had been offered at other places so far.  Last but not least, Ford Fairfield offers a 3-day money back guarantee and a free 3-month 3000 miles drive train warranty - providing peace of mind that you just can't get from a test drive.  And here's the kicker: within the first 3 days I actually had the truck checked out by a local service shop and it passed all of their tests with flying colors. They also confirmed that the vehicle had recently been serviced, as all fluids looked new and the fuel filter caps were clean. Even without knowing the price we paid, their mechanic came to the front office while I checked out and congratulated us on having made a ""good purchase!""

Typically my wife and I are actually pretty skeptical about most car dealers and don't trust anyone easily. But our experience with Ford Fairfield was refreshingly different. Before, during and even after our visit Sonja Farias was personable, professional, and all-in-all just an absolute pleasure to deal with! Everyone else there was very friendly too - from the people manning the front desk to the financing department to a couple of folks we ran into on the lot.  The facility is big, clean, and inviting, yet we don't feel that we've paid for it with an inflated price - on the contrary! Sure it's not exactly around the corner from our home, but it was so worth it.  We will certainly check with Ford Fairfield again when we're in the market for our next car! 

Well done, Sonja and the rest of the Ford Fairfield team!
Thank you so much!",5.0
612,"March 14, 2014","I walked in and immediately felt at home at Fairfield Ford. Especially since they were dog friendly and welcomed our dog Diego. We met with Nikhil Manchanda and he sat me down and we went through some basic details. He then took me around to look at some cars. His attention to detail was impressive. It's obvious that he takes his job very seriously and is able to answer any question that I had.....and believe me, I had a LOT of questions. We picked a car and went on a test drive. During that drive, it was discovered that he and my wife are from the same city. We then got to know Nikhil the man, not Nikhil the Salesman. This was a clincher for us. We went back to the dealership and made a deal. 

Everyone was great at Fairfield Ford. From the guy who opened the door for us, down to the young lady in financing who worked wonders. We will definitely return to Fairfield Ford and recommend them to our friends. ",5.0

I felt that he genuinely cared that I was OK with the deal and my payment was where it needed to be for me to be comfortable. The dealership gave me a great price for my trade.

614,"March 11, 2014","I originally purchased a new C-Max via the internet a few days ago. After the car was delivered to me (I live in San Francisco) I noticed the Panorama Roof was chipped and the seal was damaged as well. I called Fairfield Ford immediately to discuss my options and decided it was best to drive over so they could observe the damage. As I walked through the front door there were two people standing by to greet me, the internet salesman(who sold me the first car and hand delivered) and Bryan Rice, the Direct Sales Manager. From the moment I sat down it was all about making me happy and quickly solving the situation. I decided that I would like another car rather than repair the chipped glass. I thought for sure this would be an all day negotiation with salesmen, managers, finance, etc. However, three hours later I was driving home in another new C-Max with the exact same options, identical interior and slightly different exterior paint. All for the exact same price! Bryan spent extra time with me to assure there were no defects and I couldn't be happier with the entire experience. I highly recommend Fairfield Ford and I would not hesitate to return for another new car. ",5.0

631,"February 21, 2014","I was ready to buy my first car with no more than a $2,000 down payment, and I was not going to buy used. Looking for an affordable new car while still making a wise decision proved to be a tough task for myself. However, I did find myself interested in the 2014 Ford Fiesta. I have always geared toward Toyota for ""reliability"" and never quite thought of Ford when it came to buying my first car. I now know what reliability truly is since purchasing my new car. Fuel-efficiency, intelligent safety features, and more warranties than I ever thought existed that cover the cost of everything from car washes to oil-changes and from dents to new engine components. Best of all, Ford financed my loan and provided me with an APR that is unheard of for a single 19 year-old male with no credit history nor cosigner.

Nikhil was the first person that I spoke with from the dealership. He gave me a call after I submitted a form on their website. I missed his call and ended up calling him back at 10:30pm, which was over an hour past his shift ended (excuse my manners). He answered and offered to have me visit the dealership and browse their selection. Lacking a vehicle at the time, I told him it would be hard to make it out there that afternoon, especially since my work schedule is pretty strict being that I'm active-duty military. He said that it was no problem, and even picked me up from my base to drive me out to the car lot and check out what was available to me.

I had my eye set on the 2014 Ford Fiesta SE, and, between the hours of 6pm and 10pm, we took care of everything necessary to have me driving that brand new car off the lot. The whole process was relatively painless, and I was involved with every step along the way. Nothing was hidden in plain sight; there were no tricks or gimmicks. After settling on a price and finding insurance, I worked with Seffie to go over all of my warranty options and final details of my payments. She, much like Nikhil, offered great customer support.

I felt comfortable with my understanding of everything that was going on around me, and I am typically a very cautious and indecisive person. I was, and still am, impressed with everything that happened.",5.0

Taurus, the first salesman I spoke to, kept in constant contact through the buying process- he described the condition of the car in detail, and kept me appraised of the degree of interest of other buyers so I knew when to reserve a test drive (I was 1 1/2 hours away, but decided to come up during the week to scoop the competition).   When we met in person, he turned out to be really friendly guy.  This is the forth car I've bought from a dealer (the second used car).  I think this was my best experience so far.

Signing papers within the comfort of your own living room is far better than waiting around the dealership.  I think more people would take advantage of this if they knew it was an option.

Most dealerships I've dealt with have not been as friendly under those circumstances. Easily the best new car experience I've ever had.

They didn't even pick apart my trade in vehicle. They went straight to low end KBB value as I would expect, but otherwise didn't try to undercut that for the bad tires, chips in the windshield and paint, etc. that I'm accustomed to dealers raking you over the coals for.

664,"February 17, 2012","My husband and I arrived on a Sunday with our 15 week old baby to purchase a used 05 Ford Explorer that we had seen online. We were greeted by Dave in the lot and Terry at the door and treated hospitably. It was very exciting that this was our first time buying a vehicle as a family and already daydreaming of where we might drive off to first once purchasing the suv. Until Terry came around the corner with this embarrassed and angry look on his face while gracefully telling us that the vehicle we were just about to sign papers on and waited for 4 hours with our patient baby was sold out from underneath of us. With that, my husband and I collected ourselves and child and left the premises with the thought and determination of Never Ever coming back! Thursday night rolled around still fuming with embarrassment and rage at what happened and how the heck these things seem to happen to us when Greg called. He was very apologetic, respectful and did not try to even hide what happened that Sunday. "" I would like a second chance at winning back your business if you are willing, if not I completely understand and regret you having such an experience"" Greg said. Poor Greg unfortunately got me, Debbie, on the phone at the time and was kind and patient listening to my experience and feelings on our experience. I explained that I respected him calling and I would love to give him a second chance at receiving my business if he was able to give me what I wanted at the right price. He offered an 05 mercury mountaineer, with everything included except a moonroof to keep this short. My husband and I looked up the details on the vehicles and their reviews and decided to go purchase the suv. We negotiated with Terry and then met Mo about dropping the price down more due to a part needing to be fixed. Mo and Terry were great at helping us come to an agreement. Upon our leaving with the vehicle and already signing papers we noticed tape and a missing part on the roof rack and Terry was wonderful jumping right into the situation with discussing the issue with Mo and taking care of the issue. I had to bring the truck back to get the part and tape fixed and cleaned at no additional cost. It was fabulous, until we noticed, oh my gosh there is rust and paint peeling off of the roof! We called Mo right away to figure out what the heck needed to be done and what the cost was going to be. It was frustrating, one thing going wrong one after another but without Mo being as courteous and caring about our business and family was willing to pay for almost the whole cost of getting the roof fixed. We only had to fork out 250.00 for the 800 dollar cost of painting the roof on top of only paying 10,900 for the suv. All of the guys were great with working with us and prices. Mo was very helpful and considerate when giving us a great price for a great vehicle. Terry and Greg were wonderful on getting us information we needed and taking care of business. The only thing I would recommend to the guys is to work on communicating better with each other. Other than that, my husband and I are very appreciative for the help and care given to us and look forward to a long and loyal relationship with Ford of Fairfield.",3.0
665,"November 04, 2011","You, and Ford Motor Company, deserve better.
Working with this dealership has been one of the most frustrating experiences of my life, with the sales and parts departments and dealership management proving themselves to be idiots or imbeciles time after time during the month that we tried to purchase a new car through the dealership.
During the summer I ordered a 2012 Ford Mustang GT from Ford Fairfield. In early September I was told that the vehicle was being off-loaded in Benicia, and should be ready for pick-up in the next day or two. Two weeks later it finally reached the dealership. 
Once at the dealership, three standard ""dealer installed accessories"" needed to be installed to complete the vehicle (these were standard parts that are shown at ""build and price"" section of the Ford website, and the accessories were spec'ed at the time we ordered the vehicle). When we first arrived to pick up the vehicle, none of the accessories had been installed. During the next few weeks Ford Fairfield tried to get us to accept accessories other than what we ordered, argued that the standard vehicle already included the accessories and otherwise lied and mislead us. Four times we were told that the vehicle was ready to be picked up, and four times we showed the salesman the parts that were missing - even going so far as to show the sales manager the parts on the Ford website and show the salesman the parts on other vehicles on their lot. Four times we walked away without the car since it was not as ordered.
The sales manager blamed the parts guy, but after weeks of addressing the same problem, that excuse was no longer believable. 
We contacted the General Manager of Ford Fairfield to voice our dissatisfaction with the way his organization had handled the delivery of the vehicle. While he was astonished to hear about our experience, and promised to investigate further, we never heard back from him or anyone at the dealership. 
Everyone makes mistakes, it's how you handle those mistakes that determines your reputation. Sadly, Ford Fairfield has shown that they are incapable of providing a vehicle as ordered, or taking the steps to get the vehicle completed and ready for delivery. Their salesforce is ignorant of the standard options offered on thier vehicles, and their parts department is equally ignorant and unable to provide the correct parts to complete a vehicle. 
There is no way that I would buy a $10 part from these imbeciles, let alone a $35K vehicle. If my experience is any indication of the competence of the individuals at this dealership, I  imagine the service department is equally incapable and can not imagine letting them put a wrench on my vehicle.
So, really, you're going to spend $20-50K on a new vehicle. Would you rather spend it at a dealership run by and populated by idiots and imbeciles, or go elsewhere and work with honest, intelligent people who will take care of you and appreciate your business?
Please don't spend your money at Ford Fairfield - and let's hope Ford Motor Company fires this dealership group and gives the franchise to a group / organization worthy of all of our business.",1.6
666,"November 03, 2011","I took 3 hours for an oil change and then the manifold smelled from spilled oil. I showed the service writer, Aaron where a proevious recall repair had been done incorreclty and he agreed to look into it. Later he said it had been over 12 months and he couldn't be sure it was from the recall repair. Then the car would have come like that, which is even worse. Anyway, they're someone else's problem, now. I'll never go back.",3.4

670,"July 06, 2011","Everything was as it was supposed to be.  Used Costco Buying Program.  Called in advance, talked with Justin twice; once before I looked locally and again the day before I drove down to pick up the F-150.  Everything as agreed upon, including installing the bed liner before I arrived.  Sales, appraisal, and other personnel were professional and friendly.  On our way in two hours; pretty quick for a car buying experience.  No hesitation recommending this program and dealer to anyone.",5.0
671,"July 06, 2011","Mark and Justin worked with me to tailor the deal for our needs. Justin went the extra mile to get the extra rebates that we qualified for. The aftermarket leather came out much better than I thought it would. Many thanks to Mark for his personal efforts in getting the leather package done on time. Great job guys!

673,"July 06, 2011","Just bought a Ford F150 on 05/07/11.  GREAT service, not the typical pushy sells person.  They went above and beyond to get the F150 that my husband and I wanted. The internet sells team work great together to make sure that they cover when one of the members are off.  They don't just leave you waiting.  They waived the dealer trade fee and worked with us to make sure that the payment was in the range that we had discussed.  I will definitely recommend them to all family and friends that are looking to buy a new car or truck.",5.0
674,"July 05, 2011","Very helpful in locating the truck that was right for me- found it, gave me a GREAT deal on it, gave me the best number on my trade in truck, found me -by FAR- the best financing (they actually TRY to help you!)  I didn't have to wait around forever, they did most of the work while I wasn't there!  Thanks guys!  Oh yeah- and they are DOG FRIENDLY, which is a big PLUS to me! :)",5.0

676,"July 05, 2011",Jack Droast was very friendly and professional. He took the time to answer all my questions in a polite and thorough manner. He went into detail about the necessary service required. He did a price match so that I would have the best price and he was considerate of my time. It was nice doing business with him. I would come back as well as recommended him to others.,5.0
677,"July 05, 2011","Friendly, no-pressure environment; enjoyed my conversations with the various folks; my initial point-of-contact at the dealership was very proactive and had my vehicles ready to go for a test drive in front of the dealership as soon as I got there.  Management was willing to work with me on price, I had a trade-in, I wasn't too happy with the trade-in value I got for my excellent-condition trade-in car (especially since now they are advertising it for over $4,500 for what they paid me).  The paperwork was excessive and could be more expeditious.  The negotiations were long, but I never felt pressured into agreeing to something I didn't feel right about.  Overall, a good experience, would have been great if: they gave me a higher price for my trade-in, adjusted their invoice price for the car.  ",4.2
