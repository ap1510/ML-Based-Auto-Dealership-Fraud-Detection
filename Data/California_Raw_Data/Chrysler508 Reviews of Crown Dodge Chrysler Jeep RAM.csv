7,16-Mar-20,"Overall a pleasant and ethical experience. My salesperson was Maximus. He was great, very easy going and didn't waste time. His managers and finance officer were equally great to work with, they definitely have some options for the credit challenged individuals like myself. I didn't have to drive far for the van I bought and now I have a dealership close by that I'll be going to for service for the years to come due to there great customer service. Thanks Crown üëç.

13,27-Feb-20,My 2015 grand caravan needed an hvac motor and diagnostic of suspension. I was not able to get a service appointment by phone so I drove in and waited in line and got an appointment for the following week. I dropped off the car Monday and it was finished the following Wednesday. They replaced the hvac fan motor and the rear shocks. ,4
14,27-Feb-20,"Overall, I had a good experience working with Aaron Lane in purchasing my 2019 Dodge Challenger GT. He is very friendly person and supportive even after I bought the car, a couple of days later I realized one of the key is not for my car and informed Aaron, he tried to find my keys and when he couldn't he ordered for a new keyfob and he told me that he can mail it to me so that I don't need to drive back to them. I highly recommend him and definitely I will buy my next car from him.

15,24-Feb-20,"Great selection of trucks as well as cars which is close to my Ventura County home and work location. 
CROWN DODGE has a great selection.....",5
16,22-Feb-20,"Cliff is always great.  He explains and recommends additional service.  Thanks
He should get a 10 for his service. He is the best I ever had there.",5

18,16-Feb-20,John worked with me and was able to meet at a price we both agreed upon. Happy with my purchase and will recommend to anyone,5
19,13-Feb-20,"Someone made a mistake with our paperwork. Mistakes happen, it's how you fix them. It took us 20 plus phone calls and hours of our time before someone took us seriously enough to look into our issue. If you work with Sammy, run. They could care less about their customers post sale.",1
20,07-Feb-20,Appointments for oil changes would be nice otherwise work was done within Two hours.  I was well informed by text messages about the progress of the work.,5
21,04-Feb-20,Terrible having to wait 1 hour before you have a scheduled appointment! Totally poor business! Apologies after apologies doesn‚Äôt help! Bad service for me,1
22,03-Feb-20,"Excellent customer service by Johnny and the cashiers when picking up my car per Johnny was clear and called
Me with updates on my service ",5
23,03-Feb-20,Took in my Jeep Wrangler 2018 for service and another issue. Taken care of quick and was set up with a rental. Issue was solved with In two days. When I came back to pick up my Jeep service was great and my Jeep was washed and is driving great. Brian and Robert were on it. ,5
24,01-Feb-20,"I am so pleased with this recent experience. My daughter had previously purchased a used car from Crown and was really taken advantage of. And while I understand that salesman are in this business to make money, this was way beyond that. And besides paying way too much for her car, she didn‚Äôt like it! I came back into the dealership with her and we met with Darren Stewart. He was just great! He helped my daughter get into a car she really loves at a price that was much more than just fair. For this we are very grateful. After a really great interaction with Darren and getting my daughter a great car, we were helped by George in finance. He is great, too!  Honest and  patient. And really fun to talk to! These two men changed my entire opinion of this dealership. Thank you!",5
25,01-Feb-20,"Again, as with other times, I have had a good experience at this dealership service center.  Johnny Lemuz who helped me, with arranging the service for my grand cherokee,  was exceptional.  Explained everything and answered all the questions, gave me updates and followed up. Great customer service.  Everyone I spoke to, were helpful.  Even though I do not live close, I would come back.",5
26,01-Feb-20,Fast and easy. Aaron was great to work with. I told him my needs and he delivered without the back and forth. They say the key to success is to deliver more than what the customer paid for and I got that from Aaron. He will be very successful.,5
27,31-Jan-20,The Service Management has a bad attitude and blames computers and an out dated shop for why they couldn‚Äôt fix my car. Will not use this repair shop again. ,1
28,31-Jan-20,"This review is a little late.  Several months ago I went to Crown Dodge for an Oil Change.  When I purchased my Dodge Durango, X amount of Oil Changes were included. The Service Guy that checked me in stated that the amount of Oil Changes have expired and I would have to pay for  all future Oil Changes.  I was not happy. This was not explained to me when I purchased my vehicle.  I went to find my Sales Person.  He  stated he couldn't do anything and brought me over to see Mr. Dave Weber.  Dave was amazing.  He took his time, allowed me to explain everything that happened, and understood my situation.  He had a few words with my Sales Person, then stated to me that he would make things right.  I thanked him for being so fair and empathetic and he said...""I BELIEVE THAT YOU SHOULD TREAT OTHERS THE WAY YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE TREATED.""  Thank you Mr. Weber for taking a horrible experience and turning it into a testimony in restoring my faith in Humanity.",5
29,29-Jan-20,It was a straightforward deal with no pressure.  My only concern was buying a truck at my age. That was the fault of whoever stoled my truck. The staff was very cooperative and made it a good experience. Thanks  ,5
30,28-Jan-20,"I bought my car on Jan 2 and I was told I would have 45 days until my first payment was due. I got a letter saying my first payment is due on Feb 1. I called the salesman that helped me with the car and he said just come in and we‚Äôll fix it. I came in and talked to a finance officer and she told me it can‚Äôt be changed and I should have read my contract and it stated Feb 1st. 

I‚Äôve now had this car for almost a month and still haven‚Äôt gotten a call for when I can get the tint put on. I could have saved money and went to a tint shop and gotten it done on the same day. The only reason I did it here is because I was told I would get a loaner car while they do the work, which after reading my contract I see also is not true. 

Now do I love the car, yes. Do I feel like I got cheated, not really.  It‚Äôs the inconvenience of it all. I shouldn‚Äôt be told one thing and not get it. That‚Äôs a real bad sales tactic. 

Moral of the story, don‚Äôt believe what they say. Believe what‚Äôs on your contract and read every single page before signing it. I will definitely not buy another car from here, nor will I recommend anyone else too.",1
31,25-Jan-20,"Jorge schweizer was very helpful to get a car thanks so much we live our new jeep Parriot, highly recommended him whe you look for your new car",5
32,23-Jan-20,Had an oil change and tire rotation today  and I was very pleased with the courteous and efficient staff who handled my service today. I would recommend the service Dept. ,5
33,19-Jan-20,"Beware of this dealership, You'd better know the ins & outs of car buying and financing.  Be prepared to challenge the employees. I've purchased 13-15 cars over the last 20 years & this was by far the worst experience. .  ",1
34,17-Jan-20,Went in to trade our car and got the best deal possible!! Thanks @Max for all your help! And Jordan! You guys were awesome!! Second purchase from them. ,4
35,15-Jan-20,"Took my jeep for oil change at 8am , no appointment needed . Express  oil change ! I was there for 3 hours ! I not sure the definition of express but Crown jeep in oxnard ca im sure is not at any point a express service ! I would lake a look  at renaming it to something more true . Besides that the year 2020 and customer service is non existent so i will not comment. . ",3
36,14-Jan-20,If you want to buy a car..go see Jesse or Jordan. They will find you the right car with the best price within your budget with little money down. When I bought my Chrysler I was making $8 an hour. I'm about to trade it in and buy 2 more. ,5
37,12-Jan-20,"Dealership advertised pricing and deal that was made originally was not followed through on. Sales guys blame finance guys, finance blames sales guys. Dont trust!",1
38,10-Jan-20,"I bought my 2019 Jeep Grand Cherrokee Altitude in November of 2018. It was sold to me with the wrong VIN number. Crown Dodge Ventura on King Street contacted me months later with the mistake. It took me countless hours, over 22 phone calls to the dealership, and dealership management with very few calls returned. I was offered nothing for my inconvenience. I had to call and correct the Mopar card myself. I feel I should have been compensated. I recieved 3 sets of registration stickers for the same car. The last set was sent to me Nov. 2019. I am so incredibly disappointed by this dealership, management and lack of customer service. Many friends have bought new cars in the past year. All I say is DONT GO TO CROWN DODGE. I love my Jeep but regret my choice of dealership. The customer service manager has yet to call me. I cringe driving to this place just to get an oil change. Which took 2 hours today. Unbelievable. Disappointing.......",1
39,08-Jan-20,"David Azizi is the best! Largest and best selection in southern California. Staff are attentive, kind, and friendly with focus on customer service. Highly recommend!",5
40,06-Jan-20,"The employees were very nice. My vehicle went in for warranty repair and when delivered it did not work at all. I did get a loaner. 

",1
41,03-Jan-20,Very good experience  and very professional  will recommend to others who  need work done on there vehicle . Brian was not pushy on trying to sell me other services.,5
42,02-Jan-20,"We had the best car buying experience! We were welcomed in by Roberto the sales representative who showed us cars we were interested in, helped us to decide on the car best suited our needs. We bought the new beautiful car and had fun and excitement during the process! Thanks all you guys at Crown Dodge for making it fun and easy for us!",5
43,01-Jan-20,Absolutely horrible experience. Incompetent sales and service is an understatement. Stay far away.  What should have been a happy experience for my wife and I turned into a nightmare that lasted 3 months.  ,1
44,31-Dec-19,STAY AWAY FROM JORGE! He‚Äôs a snake! We agreed to deal twice and at the last minute he tried to replace it with terrible numbers. DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH HIM. He is not a man of his word and you will regret it.,1
45,30-Dec-19,Drove 1.5 hours to purchase a truck and it was delivered as promised over the phone.  Mario Amparan was outstanding and Pete Rosca made the paperwork go by quickly.  Will Highly recommend ,5
46,30-Dec-19,Good dealership with a good selection of vehicles. We were waited on immediately and everyone was very helpful. This was my sons first vehicle he purchased and they made the process enjoyable. ,5
47,30-Dec-19,"I got a great car.  I just got back from Utah and it was very comfortable and did great in the snow, and I love the leather seats. Yes I would recommend Crown Dodge to everyone I know.

48,27-Dec-19,"Max is the man, I called him earlier today and with in hours I was in and purchased my new truck. Max is very professional, and he played no games. He is a man of his words and I will forever be grateful for him. If anyone is going in for a purchase I highly recommend working with Max. 

Along with Max being great, the rest of the team did tremendous. From Jordan helping out to Sami in the finance department.",5
49,23-Dec-19,"This is the worst Dodge dealership in the country. Do not even waste your time and go there. They lied to me and told me that they are going to give me 5 days option to finance my loan because the rate they gave me was so high, and after I got approved with my bank with 3% lower rate I called the dealer and they said that they already send my loan to the lender and that I cannot finance it with my bank. And I've been trying to contact anyone at this dealer to look into this issue and no one is answering me or even calling me back. 

THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS. 

Before I bought my car from them, they would call me 5 times a day to go their and buy the car, after I bought the car I cannot get anyone on the phone to talk to about my issue with financing.",1
50,21-Dec-19,Jorge took the time and effort to help me get in a new pick up with in a budget which was a priority for me . Didn‚Äôt think it was possible.. Thanks Jorge !!,5
51,12-Dec-19,Thank you Max! You have given me a chance to succeed in life. You took my busted old car and got me into a fully electric super sweet car! I love it and I‚Äôm so grateful. Thank you!,4.8
52,10-Dec-19,"This dealership is the worst I have ever purchased from! I had to find my own way around the BS they tried to throw at me. From interest rates on ore approvals to using. EP code from a retired worker to USAA rebates that arenas good as gold. DONT COME HERE, go to another Dodge dealer in the area!!!!! I love my car but I HATE the experience. ",1
53,09-Dec-19,"Service dept is 0 stars!!!My wife's car was at the dealership for a month. For the first 2 1/2 weeks, I could not reach my service advisor, who later on I found out he was out on leave, but no one took over while he was out. I could not reach anyone in service, I left voice messages after messages and not return phone calls. Service manager Dave was of no help, was borderline combative towards my concerns and requests ",1
54,06-Dec-19,"Jorge was awesome, he helped me very much to make the right Decision on my new car purchase, i am in love with my new Dodge Charger SRT :)",5
55,01-Dec-19,Where should I start? This place is a joke. This dealership gives you a runaround and puts a bad name to the brand. Specially when you have sales associate like Max Luis who lures customers at any cost even though the dealership doesn't carry the car you requested. Won't recommend anyone to go buy from there.,1
56,29-Nov-19,"Sales team was excellent. Process a bit slow, it's a very high volume dealership, took 3+ hours over all to complete transaction, on a busy Saturday. Reached a satifactory deal after a few back and forths. Sales rep Aaron Lane went above and beyond and gets highest kudos for his efforts. Finance / cashier need serious work and retraining in accurate info.and customer service response.",4.4
57,26-Nov-19,The service department provides awful customer service. I waited 30 minutes in line before someone got to me just to tell they had too many cars. They wanted me to reschedule. Despite me having a appointment with with them.,1
58,25-Nov-19,"My experience with the sale support was awesome, they were very pleasant  I am very happy with my purchase. Edin was very helpful  in assisting me with my purchase. ",5
59,23-Nov-19,"Very good service and pleasant staff and very accommodating, my 4th purchase from Crown Dodge. Great inventory of cars and priced very well. Happy with my purchase!",5
60,21-Nov-19,"I had a fleet vehicle sent to this site for pickup. I called to work out details on picking up and dropping off the old one. I was unable to get anyone to assist me for days. There were messages left with zero response back. It appears the vehicle was at the site for at least a few days to a week. I would get passed on to a different person whom was unavailable to help. The Dodge dealership in Manteca was 10 times better and would rate five starts. This group should get some training from them.

Jeff was the only helpful person. The receptionist was beyond rude",1
61,18-Nov-19,"Darren and Aaron was great! Made our purchase very smooth and easy...
Darren Handled everything for the most part. I‚Äôm very happy with my choice in the dealership. If I can suggest, you need cookies for your customers!! ",5
62,18-Nov-19,Service writer was very unprofessional. We took my 2018 Jeep Wrangler in for the ‚Äúdeath wobble fix‚Äù. The fix was part of a recall. He didn‚Äôt bother to look up my car or address the problem because his mechanic was unable to replicate the violent shaking I experienced. Told me he would just keep driving my car until it ran out of gas. When I went to retrieve my Jeep the service manager ( David ) intervened and was able to ascertain what the problem was and get it fixed. Johnny was rude and aggressive with my husband and I won‚Äôt be taking my Jeep back there.,2
63,17-Nov-19,Great experience in buying from this dealer . Not only did I get the truck I always wanted along with the deal I wanted ... I also made Few new friends. ,5
64,15-Nov-19,"1. The website after 3 years still will not let me sign in, or book appointments. 
2. The Service Department personal are overworked and most of the time act irritated if you have a question.
3. Even with a scheduled appointment it is a ridiculously long process to get checked in.",1.8
65,03-Nov-19,"Best sales man he went out of his way to help me get a new car, i would totally recommend him when you get a new car.",5
66,30-Oct-19,"Always happy with their work but wasn't happy with the checkout process as I was told the indirect price - TWICE! Gratefully the Cashier honored the last price I was quoted.  They (svc dept, I guess) lied & said they spoke with my father, he wasn't even around for them to speak to. Very grateful they did the right thing & honored the quoted price. Thank you!",4.4
67,26-Oct-19,"There is no such thing as Customer Service here.  They fake smile at you, and recite their corporate scripts, but if they can't make money from you, they do not care! I have been having reoccurring issues with my Jeep, which is still under warranty.  A simple part replacement would solve the issue, and I would be happy, but they refuse to order the part, citing ""compatibility issues"" which, is still not a problem for the customer.  Also, if there are compatibility issues with certain phones and how they interact with their vehicles, then they are at the very least guilty of false advertisement as no where in the vehicle manuals, dealer documentation or advertisements that only some devices may work with their internal systems.
Again, they looked at my under warranty vehicle, ran some tests that had already been done before AND was documented (which they had access to) and the end result was still that they weren't going to fix the issue.

DO NOT EVER DO BUSINESS WITH THIS DEALERSHIP!",1
68,24-Oct-19,Angel Bay helped me a lot with purchasing my new 2019 Dodge challenger! He answered all of my questions and more. I would recommend Angel Bay to family and friends looking for a new car or truck at crown dodge Ventura. ,5
69,22-Oct-19,One of the best service departments I‚Äôve ever had to deal with! Isabelle was kind and made sure I was completely happy and taken care of.,5
70,21-Oct-19,"I absolutely  will never come to this place again, I was sold a car with a major prior issue.  Only had car for 4 months and heater coil somehow just went out? Dealership try to charge me crazy about instead making this right.  Shame on you!!!!",1
71,17-Oct-19,"I took my car in for an oil change, I was previously told it would take 4 hours. I can do this myself in 30 minutes if I had the oil. Anyway it did take nearly 4 hours. The service writer was a nice guy but couldnt tell me what sort of oil they used for my car, which was the only reason I went there in the first place. I dont have confidence that they used the right oil.",3.4
72,15-Oct-19,"Jorge was very helpful and make my new car buying experience very easy, love my new Dodge Challenger SRT, I highly recommend  him for all your car needs ",5
73,14-Oct-19,"The service advisor was not professional Rude and and not been truthful with his statement
As for me I would not like to be Helped with this person if he is  the only option could help me  I would prefer to go somewhere else",3.6
74,14-Oct-19,They had the car and had a nice no nonsense experience I dealt with the Internet sales person Darren and he was very good about not playing games and her seeing how much she could get but gave me a nice fair price,5
75,12-Oct-19,I purchased a vehicle at a different dealership and they would not give me a second key. Johnny greeted me and informed me a laser cut key had to be made from Chrysler and I would have to have it ordered and return than to have it programmed . I realize the other dealership was at fault and I had no guarantee but the service I received from Johnny was outstanding he had it done while I waited. . I will return for service to visit my new service guy. ,5
76,11-Oct-19,It took me 4 (1. To check key stock and made appt 2. Went to appt and they sold the key so had to order another. 3. Went to appt and computers were down. 4. Went to last appt and finally got key) visits to get a replacement key and therefore it was very disappointing. ,1.6
77,11-Oct-19,"Great customer service . Very happy with the write up process, the service and the follow up. I would recomend the service department and will be back ",5
78,11-Oct-19,"Jorge was very helpful and friendly, love my new 2016 Chrysler Town and Country, I highly recommended him, I will buy my next car from him, I made the best choice!  ",5

80,08-Oct-19,"I called on Tuesday 9/17/19 to check status of our Pacifica van.@ 3pm.Was left on hold for 58 minutes.
Unacceptable! Kept getting transferred three times.After nearly an hour on hold, I was told the alternator was on order.It wont be here until Thursday or Friday.We have already waited a week.Seems like an alternator could have been found at another dealer and brought to your dealership in a week.Or obtained from another vehicle on your lot?You should keep such a common part in stock.Then,
when Duane called on Thursday to say‚ÄùYour van is ready for pick up,I was told the courtesy shuttle doesn‚Äôt come to Ojai.My husband is unable to drive 
at this time.I needed a ride to your dealership.They finally agreed to pick me up.Why so many hurdles to get a simple servicing on our vehicle?You have been in business for 40 years.No excuse for poor customer service!!üò¢ I‚Äôm sure happy that the van was under a lease warranty, so it was no cost to us.

84,02-Oct-19,"I truly went into the car dealership several times in the past with credit that was not up to par. I returned when I got things a little better and this salesman from the minute I walked in treated me like family. He went to bat for me which is something rare in this day and age. After hard work on his part, I left with a Brand New Charger 2019 off the lot which is a dream come true. Thank you, Angel and Crown Dodge.",5
85,30-Sep-19,"They really go the extra mile for us, makes the new car experience even better!  Service team is welcoming and respectful of our busy schedule ",5
86,24-Sep-19,JP was very professional while handling my service appointment. He informed me of other issues with my car and if I wanted to have them taken care of then or at a later date. He also informed me JP called me with updates and also had my car washed for me. ,4.8
87,19-Sep-19,There were multiple issues with my car. I fully expected to get it back after at least a couple of days. I dropped it off mid-morning and got it back the next afternoon. Thank you!,4.8
88,13-Sep-19,"Even though I scheduled an appointment and dropped off in the morning they do not put your vehicle in that time slot, you just go in line like everyone else.  Car was not done until 5pm for a simple recall fix,  then waited 30 min just for them to bring the vehicle out so I could leave. Could go on and on with this dealership, 
But the bottom line, go somewhere else. ",1.5
89,10-Sep-19,"My salesperson was very friendly and did everything to try and accommodate us. The original vehicle we went to see was not equipped with what we needed. She worked with us until she found the right one, and they worked out the price for us.",4.8

92,23-Aug-19,"Really bad customer service.
I went yesterday to pick up my truck, I told them to washed and it came back the same, I told the guy why you guys didn‚Äôt washed and he said I‚Äôm lonely I couldn‚Äôt, when he took forever to give me my truck back because he was to busy watching the game Raiders vs Packers. I was so mad.

I was told a General manager would call me to discuss this situation but he blew me off, so as far as I'm concerned I will not shop there again. I will go back to Ford..",1

106,12-Jun-19,If you are a young lady and not 100% sure about how to buy a car then they will steal from you. Everyone be aware of the shady finance department. They will pack your payment with product and then glaze over the paperwork in hopes that you won‚Äôt notice. Then when confronted they will try to deny and say it was your fault. They are doing illegal things and they are blatantly stealing money. They also use lies like ‚Äúyou get this interest rate because of your age‚Äù ... their finance department is dirty and I hope the authorities get involved to crack down on the blatant cheating and stealing that takes place. ,1

The second appointment the car was kept about a week, but they did arrange for a loaner.  When I picked up the car, the water spotting on the windows and mirrors was awful.  Evidently during multiple water tests the water was allowed to dry.  The car wash did not remove the majority of the spotting.  I had to use some low strength vinegar to remove all the spots.  Where‚Äôs the quality control that makes sure the vehicle is presentable for the customer?  I appreciate that my car has been fixed (awaiting the first real rain) but leaving the car in that condition was unacceptable.

141,17-Jan-19,"Owning a Jeep since 2009 I bought it at the Ventura Kirby dealership before crown took over  
I typically do most of the maintenance myself and overall the Jeep has been trouble free for 10 years.  Jeeps are the most reliable cars I‚Äôve owned.  This is number 3.   With that said my Jeep has a lifetime powertrain warranty and every 5 years requires a dealer inspection.   After reading many of the reviews of crown I was hesitant to bring it in.  The first 5 year inspection took them all day when‚Äôs they told me it would be 2 hours.  This time for the 10 year I was smart and just dropped it off.   Tony Lopez assures me he‚Äôs take care of everything for me and make my visit painless.   Indeed he did and then some.  Everything was as promised and they even went the extra mile on a few things.  I can only say it put my hesitation and concern ornery the crown reviews for service to rest.   I‚Äôd recommend Tony Lopez to anyone needing service at crown.   They seem very busy there but he‚Äôs a good dude and will take care of you.  Thanks again Tony!!!",5

Went the second day to see what was going on, I was told that if my truck had recalls I was going to get a loaner, the mechanic refused my loaner truck, 
So at the end I want it either my loaner truck or my truck, I didn‚Äôt get the loaner I took my truck back, the mechanic said some BS and tried to force  me to pay $150.00 for a service wasn‚Äôt done or leave my truck to finish the work

171,02-Oct-18,"My review is not so much against Crown Dodge, but rather the Dodge vehicle I purchased. 
On August 25th, I purchased a 2017 Dodge Charger. After only 2 days in the car, I got a ""service shifter"" alarm. Also, the service department at Crown called me and said there was a recall on the computer software system, so I brought the car in. After they performed the upgrade, the computer system crashed. That led to them having the vehicle for 2 weeks while they tried to fix it. It required them calling the corporate mechanics because they didn't know how to fix the computer. They ended up having to replace one of the computer components. After I picked up the vehicle, I drove it for 2 days, then began having multiple problems. The check engine light came on. I also had erroneous readings that all of the tires had low tire pressure, and some sort of brown fluid was leaking from under the car. Back to the dealership. They have now had the vehicle for the past 2 1/2 weeks. At this point, I don't even want the car back. As far as I am concerned, this car isn't safe. I just want Dodge to buy the car back and allow me to purchase a vehicle that actually runs. The whole reason I spent so much money on a new vehicle is for the reliability. I am afraid that if they make me take this car back,  the computer system will fail while I'm on the freeway and I could seriously hurt or kill someone if I can's stop. Computers seem to have influence over just about everything in cars these days.  I have an open case on file requesting a buy back option. The case manager is in Texas, I believe, and she is very difficult to contact. This car is not safe, but I feel like my concerns are being ignored or at least allowed to drag on. I bought this car 5 weeks ago and have only actually driven it for a total of 4 days. The car is still in the service department as I write this review. 
The dealership itself has tried to be helpful throughout all of this. Alex, my sales manager has been helpful and is doing what he can, but the buy back option is out of his hands. The service manager has been helpful as well. Also, JP my service advisor has been an advocate. Crown Dodge has provided either a rental car or a free loaner vehicle for me while my car has been out of commission. ",2.6

JP Henricksen is my favorite advisor I can always count on him for impeccable service. He knows just how long it takes to get the service done and he informs me of any issues or recalls I may have. I never have to go looking for him to find out what is going on JP finds me. If anything else comes up he keeps me informed at I wait. Your mechanic specialist Greg is awesome. I know when he is working on my car I don't have to be concerned. He just completed a recall on my Chrysler 300 2012 the alternator replaced. Greg is really a nice person and works very hard. He is experienced and does an excellent job on my car every time I am there. This is why I continue to return to the dealership because your staff does it right!  All of the service department staff and mechanics is professional and friendly. I feel right at home when I go there because they know me by my name.

184,12-Jun-18,"I was excited to finally find a car, I get a Jeep Compass which I was sold from first glance and test drive. Once the ink was signed and I drove it off the lot, the back up camera kept sticking, even in drive. The gas mph is supposed to be 22 in the city and 32 on the freeway. I have pictures now of my gas gauge is malfunctioning and not reading accurately. The radio switches back and forth from Media on it's on. I brought the car back in for other servicing to let them know. I reported both of these problems when I brought my vehicle in on May 7th. The customer service rep told me that I indeed needed a new radio and that they couldn't find anything wrong with the gas gauge. She would order the radio and it could possibly take a day or a month. What kind of timeline is this?! Especially on a brand new vehicle. It is not June 11th and I have yet to hear back from the service department on my radio. I am still having problem with the gas gauge and can show you pictures of the issue. I am very dissatisfied with this service. A new car should now have these issues and before leaving the lot should have a full inspection. A timeline for a part should never be a day to a month. The communication on this is ridiculous. I want my radio and gas gauge fixed! No more excuses. This is disappointing to pay so much for a vehicle to not get what you paid for. I will do a courtesy to call the service department today to see if my radio is in. I have already contacted the manufacturer. If this is not handled I will seek legal counsel. I don't have a problem with the customer service rep, I have a problem with the service. ",1.8

Thanks Max!!!!,5
191,02-Apr-18,"We had a terrible experience at the Crown Dodge Service Department. I spoke with Kristin on Friday. I made an appointment for Monday morning for repairs to our new 2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee. I called at 8 am on Monday to confirm. Kristen confirmed the morning appointment time as between 9 and 10 am. She instructed us to ask for her upon arrival. 

My wife arrived at 9:05 am. She parked the car and went to one of the offices in the service department. She spoke with Monte about the scheduled repairs. He asked who she had been assigned to. She said that we had only been advised to ask for Kristin. He reacted as if there was no Kristin. He took her to a window where there were three sheets of paper taped up listing the appointments for the day. We were not on the list. 
My wife insisted that we were instructed to ask for Kristin. He then conceded that he did know Kristin and advised where she could be found.

My wife entered the main office area where she found Kristin. Kristin asked where the car was. My wife said it was parked outside. Kristin scolded her for not getting in line. We were not instructed to get in line before. 
My wife moved the car behind the 20 - 30 cars that were in line. Why were we given an appointment, then placed in line behind 30 cars? What is the purpose of an appointment?

When she got to the front of the line, a young man tried to help her. He had to find someone who would work her in, since she was not on the list and had no one assigned to her. The young man was going from one person to another, but they were all saying they were busy.

Finally, Monte came to the car and asked what she needed. She told him about the trouble we are having with the car. 
He said he saw on his tablet that we needed ‚Äúa loaner‚Äù, but there were none available. She said that was fine, she just needed a ride back. He told her she would have to take a shuttle, and there was not one until 11:00. She said okay and waited in the cold waiting room.
Luckily a nice shuttle driver came in at 10:25 and offered a ride.

At 3:48 pm Monte called to ask what was the purpose of the car being brought in. My wife had to explain the trouble again. The car had been there all day, and they hadn‚Äôt looked at it yet.

I called at 4:45 and asked when we could pick up the car. Monte said they wouldn‚Äôt be able to look at it until tomorrow. I was furious. We had an appointment at 9 am! We had been without the car for an entire day, and now they were going to keep it another day. I told him we would come and get the car.

My wife went to pick the car up. She went to Monte who waved her off and told her to go in the office for the paperwork work in order to pick up the car.

The car remains in a state of disrepair.

192,30-Mar-18,"I came in to see what Chrysler Vans were available to replace our 2006 Town & Country. Tristan Schweizer patiently showed my new vans & the Pacifica models. He informed me that Chrysler stopped making the Town & Country vans and the last year was 2015. I asked to see what they had and quickly liked the Silver 2015 Town & County, which appeared in excellent condition. Salesperson Tristan, Manager Matt and finance management Joe provided excellent knowledge and professional skills to assist us in our purchase. This makes our 4th Van from Harbor, now Crown Dodge and the experience keeps getting better, thanks to you all.

195,01-Mar-18,dented my brand new car while getting a under coat and tint.  left garbage and changed our radio stations.   after multiple complaints went to get dent fixed.  didn't completely fix it and left trash in a 2nd time.  ,1
196,12-Feb-18,"We have had issues with this dealership since we purchased our car, but put it down to experience. 8 months after the purchase I came to find out that the paperwork required for my car had never been completed.
When I contacted Darren Stewart I was sent to someone else, who wasn‚Äôt willing to help me. When I reached out to Darren again, he just ignored my emails and phone calls.
After a very stressful couple of weeks of dealing with this I had to resort to pass the case over to DMV Investigators. 
I would go somewhere else to purchase a car!! 
Not only is this dealership terribly unreliable, but the non existent concern for customers is very disappointing. 
If you read this, RUN!! ",1.5

199,23-Jan-18,"Ever since I got my 2006 3500 Ram dually, I have taken it to this dealership. I have NEVER been disappointed either with the service done on the truck or my interactions with the folks in the service department. (They are a kick in the pants, BTW.) Kristen got me in with an appointment within a couple of days (I was expecting a lot longer) to get the air bag fixed. Thank you, Kristen, for helping me keep my grandchildren safe!

I feel like this place is home. If I ever had an urgent issue, they got me in asap. Thank goodness, most of the time, I am in for maintenance (which keeps those urgent issues at bay, right?)



Besides, I love the ten cent coffee machine. :D",4.8
200,22-Jan-18,"I brought my Flawless 2007 Dodge Nitro R/T in for its' five year inspection plus it had developed a ""splash-back"" problem with the fuel inlet.  
Called, spoke with Cliff Garnett, made a service reservation and I cannot tell you how happy I am with Cliff, Kristin in the Office and  the entire Crown Family.  The service experience was so satisfying that I bought a new Chrysler 300c one week later from Crown.  In summary, if it wasn't for Cliff Garnett and Kristin Spellins, I would not have purchased my new Chrysler 300c all going back 4 years to two bad experiences I had with a Service Advisor obviously no longer employed by Crown.

Not only did it have a wash but it was vacuumed and had shiny tires. When I asked the guy who pulled it up why they had done that he was honest and said because they had gotten a little water inside.

210,06-Jan-18,"I found a bright spot at Crown Dodge.  Her name is Kristen and she works at the cashier counter.  She is friendly & knowledgeable.  

I'm not a fan of Crown Dodge Jeep Chrysler.  Their sales & service are subpar, but then western Ventura County is stuck with Crown, and the management doesn't seem to want to improve the situation.  It looks like they managed to remove themselves from YELP somehow.  Their reviews on YELP were so low they were comical.

But should you visit Crown for your service or parts department needs, swing by Kristen at the cashier's desk on the way out and visit Crown's bright spot employee.",4

228,18-Dec-17,"I recently bought my second new Ram Truck in the last 3 years from Crown Dodge.  Why buy a second one?  Because the service department treats you so well that you'd be crazy to go anywhere else..  Today, Johnny and Kelsey, in particular, took care of all the new-car add-ons, with immediate, friendly, and thorough excellence.  Three years later, Crown's service department has proven that they always have your best interests in mind.  It's the trust factor I feel toward Crown's service department - the integrity that goes with their professional skills, that keeps me coming back.  ",5
229,16-Dec-17,I've been to a few dealerships and never had the honor to get the great service angel gives. He was ready and knew everything I needed before I could explain.

243,27-Oct-17,Went to this dealership. I found 2 chargers with 20% off sticker on windshield. Just what I was looking for.. The sales person was jonny.. Which was great at first but then when it came down to price I noticed he wasn't adding the 20% off when I asked he said both cars were a mistake and they should have never had that sticker. He should have owned this from the beginning... How is this my fault? He then came back and said they granted me the 20% off which was still a lie.. he tried explaining how much money 20% off was. It never added up. I pulled out my calculator so I could show him how much 20% really was.. Which he was off by 1k. I went to car and by that time they took off stickers of 20% off.. But they really think we buyers are stupid.. I went to the other car took a picture of the 20% off.. And i took a picture of the car I was trying to buy. This is not the first time they mix up window stickers like this.. I came a month ago and had this same issue.. Also the car was labeled as a 2017 it was a 2016.. WOW.. I still was willing to give them a chance because of the car itself.. Didn't happen though. Jimmy decided to pawn me off to one of his managers.. I saw jonny outside when I was leaving.. Its my fault if you look at the reviews it would let you know about this stuff.. The manager I must say was nice.. Gerardo I believe his name was.. That's the only reason this place gets 2 starts,1
244,07-Oct-17,"My husband dropped off the car and he asked about specials fir oil changes and Eduardo was kind enough to extend a Special offer. Upon my arrival to pick up the vehicle the service Technician directed me to the service desk. As I entered the door Shey directed me towards the back with a very direct welcoming invitation to assist me. My credit issues were complex (in my opinion) due to the Credit Card points, not to Shey though. She's made the transaction so pleasant. She also multi-tasked while holding fir the Credit Card company. I thought that was impressive. If I were that other customer I would of appreciated it. GREAT JOB SHEY!",5
245,05-Oct-17,"One thing  I will say about Crowns service department  is the service staff goes above and be on the call to meet customer satisfaction. JP is diffently a person with people skills, professional attitude, communicates well with customers and also friendly. His main focus is meeting the customers needs and completing the work in a reasonable amount of time.  I always ask for him first, only because of pass experiences. Everyone there does their best when it comes to service. Whatever work I have done on my Chrysler 300 at Crown Dodge meets my expectation of service. JP is an awesome person with a great attitude and service ethics. Thank You so much.

This last time, I went up the ladder to Dave Weber and it got handled finally.  This time he had me speak to Scott Shanen who directed the repairs and it came out right this time. I even had the Porter, Alex, ask if I could bring my truck back the next day to be cleaned since he did not have time that day.  I brought it back and Alex did a fantastic job on it!

251,12-Sep-17,Service department is not as organized as the Thousand Oaks location . I don't see what the point is of making an appointment if a walkin will always go before you. Waited for over 4 hours just for a oil change. What happened to the express lane fast oil change you advertise ? Really disappointed how the service department handled this situation . HORRIBLE service !!!!!,1.8

253,09-Sep-17,I will never be using this dealership again it is unfortunate I have already bought two cars from them hopefully this review will keep somebody else from making the same mistake... both brand new cars I have bought from this dealership have been like running a marathon.. it starts with the sales people lying about prices and trying to manipulate the deal into a monthly agreement as opposed to an overall price of the car... twice they came back with monthly payments acting like I was getting a deal because they didn't understand I know how to use a calculator and when I did the math and showed them they were lying about the price I would be paying for the car.. they then come back and say oops we must have made a mistake... either you are so stupid you do not know how to do your job both times I tried to buy a car.. or you're a liar and a scam artist and you hoped I would be too stupid to catch it.. I'm pretty sure it was the second reason.. their service department is atrocious they continue with their lying long after you have bought the car the service people are rude unknowledgeable about what they are speaking about and overall horribly unpleasant to deal with.. basically their thought process is if we make this as an unenjoyable as possible for a customer they will not come back as often thus we will probably save money on warranties... my wife's car is only a year old and has been shutting off as she drives the vehicle when she called service today they told her nothing we can do for you you'll have to come by next week sometime and maybe we can take a look at it... that is absolutely unacceptable.. when I called back they just talk over you don't allow you to speak and then hang up the phone multiple times.. Crown Dodge is a disgrace the owner should be ashamed that his dealership is ran by such dishonest unworthy people.. I was going to buy another Jeep this year I will be going to a different dealership and so should you,1

He followed through with everything to make this an effortless transaction. I would definitely recommend Angel because he did what he said he would.

262,14-Aug-17,"There was a bit of a wait, because they were busy, and it was nearing lunch time.  So I had to wait a bit before speaking to the service advisor, but I didn't mind.  The service advisor was professional and concise, told me it would be about an hour and a half to 2 hours.  So I left the key in the car and got an uber home.  Called two hours later, and they were just finishing up, so I hopped in another uber back, and they were just finishing up the paperwork.  Signed, paid (apparently I'd bought a package of oil changes at some point, and I still had one left over, so the oil change was free, but I also wanted them to take a look at an issue with the plastic splash guard coming lose, so I had to pay a few dollars for the hardware to re-attach it), picked up my car (it was parked right out front) and left.  Was a very fast, painless experience, as it always is.",5

265,27-Jul-17,"Angel Bay ‚Äì aka ‚ÄòDoc‚Äô ‚Äì I was fortunate to have had Mr. Angel Bay approach me and to have had him as my Sales Rep.   Not an easy decision to make, personally ‚Äì committing to purchasing another car ‚Äì but having an agent such as Angel made my experience both comfortable and easy!  Angel ‚Äòtells it like it is‚Äô ‚Äì and I truly appreciated his straight-talk.  He ‚Äòopened my eyes‚Äô and based on his experience, assured me and guided me in to what I now know was the best decision ‚Äì that is, trade-in my run-down former vehicle and driving out of ‚ÄòCrown Dodge Chrysler Jeep Ram‚Äô with a new one!  Thanks again Crown and Mr. Angel Bay, for making my purchase experience a great one!  You all have my ‚ÄòFive Star‚Äô ***** recommendation!  ",4.2
266,23-Jul-17,"Jorge was very personable, professional, knowledgeable, and especially, patient with me as I researched all my options.  Although I did not buy or lease ultimately, I appreciate very much having had the time I needed to think about vehicle options and finance/lease options while he did his best to work a deal for me.  He was responsive to phone calls and texts during the process.  I suggest that any customer would be well served to seek him out when buying or leasing from Crown.",5
267,16-Jul-17,He was really helpful also really caring he tried his best to get us what we wanted and he got it he is very well educated. Really respectful we came here looking for him because we've bought other cars behalf from him ,5

272,23-Jun-17,"My boyfriend and I came in to look at your Dodge Challengers. A Sales  Rep named ANGEL BAY said hello and not only welcomed us but thanked us for coming to the CROWN DODGE dealership. Angel was very enthusiastic and had a lot of POSITIVE ENERGY. It's obvious he really enjoys selling cars. Angel was very polite and what my boyfriend and I were impressed with most was the way he carried himself and how professional he was and how he made buying a car so simple. We came to look and what sold us was the way we were treated and the professionalism and customer service Angel provided. I've never had a Sales Rep at any dealership give us a cold soda in a bottle ( DR PEPPER). If car dealerships had Sales Reps like ANGEL BAY they would sell more cars and have repeat business.  This guy is an asset and a GREAT SALES MAN !!!
Who ever is reading this I HIGHLY RECOMMEND CROWN DODGE and working with ANGEL BAY. This guy is TOP CLASS, FUNNY & full of POSITIVE ENERGY!!!
: - )
My boyfriend bought a DODGE CHALLENGER and he is so HAPPY!!!
I will be back to buy a JEEP WRANGLER in a month and I will ensure to ask for ANGEL!!!!",5
273,14-Jun-17,"Before I begin, let me say that I take no joy in writing such reviews. As a reasonable, patient and fair person to a fault, I take such reviews seriously. I would much rather submit a positive review (and I have done so for many organizations I have done business with), however, when really bad situations arise, I think it is important to share with those that could otherwise avoid having to go through a similar experience. This dealership is hands down the worst Jeep dealership I have ever encountered. I tried to purchase/lease a vehicle from them several weeks ago. I started off by speaking with Scott Walters, then was passed along to Darren Stewart and finally to Paul Mills. I have been a long time loyal Jeep owner with excellent credit and had many models of Jeeps both purchased and leased from various dealerships where I have lived/worked around the country. I generally always asked the same set of questions to make sure all the figures/terms are clear, so not my first rodeo as the saying goes. Crown Jeep refused to answer very basic questions that I asked verbally and in writing and then gave me attitude for actually asking the questions. Furthermore, I have tried on (3) separate occasions to make the G.M., i.e. Mr. Crown via his assistant Terry Vasquez aware of my experience so they could use as a learning tool to improve customer service for future customers, hence the reason I have resisted writing this review until now. I have never had the courtesy of a reply from her or anyone else at the dealership. Needless to say, I took my business to another dealership and was treated fairly, professionally, courteously while valuing my time. I even contacted the GM of that dealership recently to let him know how positive my experience was with the Internet Sales Manager. Do yourself a favor and avoid Crown Jeep. They are dishonest (deliberately did not apply rebates/incentives I was eligible for, probably to pocket for themselves), unprofessional and just outright rude. The place is dysfunctional and clearly it all starts from the top right on down. If I could give them zero stars I would. These people need to wake up and realize in the year 2017 that many people want to avoid the haggle and complete as much of the transaction by telephone as possible and then go in, sign the docs and be on their way. If you don't want your valuable time wasted, not to mention being unnecessarily frustrated/ripped off, then don't give this dealership your business. Go somewhere that they actually value the customer relationship and appreciate your business.",1
274,29-May-17,"Usually buying a car feels like a hassle and is I dread having to do it because cars are so expensive these days and everyone has these stupid ""dealer markup"" things. My wife and I went looking for a new car for the family and she has been eyeing the Jeep Grand Cherokee.  Anyway, long story short, we had a specific number in our head and Jorge Schweizer went above and beyond to get us that number. He did have to go back and forth with his manager but he save us a ton of time and a bunch of money. My wife was actually shocked when they said we were done and got the keys. Hands down best car buying experience to date. And I had heard all the bad things about Crown before. We just went to look and Jorge made it way to easy. ",5
275,24-May-17,"Angel is awesome and made the buying experience pleasurable. He gave me all of my options without being pushy and went above and beyond to make sure I was completely satisfied before making my final decision. I started the day off not expecting at all to drive away that same day in my dream car, but thanks to him and all of his help, that dream became a reality. I have never been happier! Would definitely refer them to anyone looking for a vehicle!",5
276,12-May-17,"we were lied to and once we paid we discarded and made feel like a burden. the sales person that hooked us up with the car was let go, and we fell through the cracks. I ended up with a car that is ok, but I would have never purchased it, had I known how unprofessional this place is. Stay far away! No one gives flying monkey about you, once you have signed that check.

Unfortunately the head of finance is not listed int he ""employees worked with"" section. 
He definitely is the guy to stay away from! ",1.2
277,11-May-17,"I came into the dealership to look at a truck my son and I planned to purchase. He had been there earlier in the day and no one was taking him seriously....until Angel Bay took the time to talk to him. He was so personable, and after a few minutes the two of them realized they had something in common. Turns put they both have/had served this great country in the military, Angel in the Navy and my son in the Marines. The military teaches integrity and honor and his service was nothing short of that. He showed us respect and we respected him greatly in return. Service was above and beyond anything I've ever experienced at this dealership and I have purchased my last 6 cars there. Angel consistently kept us in the loop on every aspect of the transaction and even brought some paperwork to us when we had last minute things to finalize. I highly recommend Angel Bay for anybody who is looking for an amazing experience purchasing a vehicle...He will not disappoint.",4.6
278,08-May-17,"I've bought many vehicles in the past, but Angel's professionalism and tireless efforts to ensure we were completely satisfied and taken care of was by far the best experience I've had!!!! He was always courteous and we never felt pressured throughout the process. I have recommended my friends and family to come and see Angel for their car buying needs to get the service they deserve when making a major purchase like buying a new car. I highly recommend him to anyone!!!",5
279,29-Apr-17,Came in looking for a Wrangler Sport 4x4 and Johnny Mikhail made it very easy and completely comfortable. I'm still young only being 25 and just starting a family I was nervous about getting into a crazy payment I couldn't afford. I straight told Johnny what I was working with and he totally made it happen no problem easy payments bad ass Wrangler. ,5
280,10-Apr-17,Came in late at night. I worked with Vince and Kyle late on a Thursday night. I came in and told them what I wanted and they made it happen. I would highly recommend these employees and this dealership,5
281,06-Apr-17,Got a good deal with Crown Dogde on a 2013 Chrysler 200. Johnny is a great salesman that looked out for us and made us feel like family. We appreciate everything ,4.8
282,05-Apr-17,"Salesperson...Vincent Jenkins and the finance office worked so hard for me. I am so grateful and I recommend that Crown Dodge is given your first choice in search of purchasing a car. Thank you Vincent and Crown Dodge :}

283,02-Apr-17,"Angel confirmed that the dealership had a Jeep Grand Cherokee Altitude 4x4 in every color and they wanted our business. Apparently, they do not since we DROVE 2 HOURS to see the 4x4 only to find out they do not have any on the lot. We have now wasted 4+ hours in travel time plus gas. This is the example of shady business. Angel didn't even show up to tell us there was no 4x4 but another salesman (JT) had to take the blame. Angel deserves zero stars.",1
284,21-Mar-17,"Vincent and Bob really overdid it will the help and service they gave to me! Much appreciated! They went above and beyond on service, help, time and assisting me with my trade in. I will recommend and be a customer for a very long time!",5
285,16-Mar-17,Mr. Bay helped me get the car that I purchased about a month or maybe a little over a month ago. He tries to stay in the budget that you want to stay in and he has also helped me get the problem taken care of with one of my headlights. I would send anyone I know looking for a car to him. ,5
286,16-Mar-17,I came in about two weeks ago after looking st some calls online. A phone call from Angel bay convinced me to walk in the door. He assisted in showing me the different options that worked for my budget and overall goals. At the end of the day I drove off the lot with my brand new 2500 cummins and I couldn't be happier. I'll continue to return to Angel for all my car buying needs. I won't hesitate to recommend him our Crown Dodge to anyone I know. ,5
287,16-Mar-17,"Mr.Bay went above and beyond my expectations on helping me get my FIRST car, I had been looking for my OWN car for a while and wasn't sure exactly what to get and was sort of in a tight budget & angel said he completely understood where i was coming from, and he really did. he helped me find a car I like and at a price i can afford ! I didn't have much credit and wasn't sure if id be able to even get a car and yet he said not to worry and called a few banks ETC and by 9pm i had the keys to a jeep compass that I liked and was a first car owner ! his customer service was beyond any 5 star rating, I work in retail and deal with customers on a daily and know how it goes, he was patient and i felt he genuinely wanted to help me out and i greatly appreciate that so thank you ! ",5
288,14-Mar-17,I've been looking into getting out of my small SUV. Angel went above & beyond for me. He took his time and made sure I was happy with what I was getting. I had an amazing experience purchasing my new full size SUV. I'm sure to come back to Angel again!,5
289,13-Mar-17,"Dishonest sales practices.  Paul Mills, Internet Sales Direct sent me an email stating, ""110% of Kelley Blue Book for your Trade!* Every day, every trade.  We Take Anything on Trade - Surprise us!""

Paul presented me with a KBB Valuation of my trade.  I said ok, now ad the 10% as you offered in your email.  He refused, made a ton of excuses why they couldn't honor his written statements. Bob Amar, Sales Manager wouldn't comment. Gus Said, General Manager was suppose to call me that day.  Two days later I call him, he left on vacation today.  

Intentionally fraudulent statements to get me into the dealership.  I would never recommend or purchase a vehicle from Crown Dodge Jeep Chrysler in any city because of this treatment. ",1
290,12-Mar-17,"Angel helped me purchase my very first car! Believe me when I say I went through months of looking for a car I could afford on top of being able to carry 3 kids. I settled for a midsize suv that would fit my budget, but would be a tight fit for my growing family. When I met with Angel, it was 7 on a Sunday night. He started working with numbers and I kept debating in my head over and over if this was really the car I wanted. We walked on the car lot and I told him about a minivan I thought was nice. Something I would like to get once I build my credit in a year or so. He looked and me and said ""show me the car you want"" and I pointed to a Red Dodge Caravan I fell in love with a few nights before when I came to the lot. And guess what? That is the car that I left in. He was patient and started up new papers, called the banks, called an insurance agent, and gave me the keys. 10:50pm, and my husband and I left with the car we wanted. He did that! 5 star rate!!! ",5
291,23-Feb-17,"Angel, Eden, and Elie have excellent communication skilks, understanding of the products, they are very patient and kind. Customer service is top notch and I never had a bad experience shopping and having my previous car serviced.  ",5
292,21-Feb-17,Angel helped me find the perfect jeep. He had me in his best interest which is so uncommon. I will recommend Angel to all of my friends looking for car and trucks and even keeps used or new . ,5
293,18-Feb-17,"My husband and I are extremely happy with the service we received from Max Luis. We didnt plan to buy that day, but we left with a new Challenger. We are very happy. Thank you!",4.8
294,09-Feb-17,"Looked up some challengers and chargers online and called Crown. I was then connected to Angel and he invited me over and set an appointment at the Ventura dealership. I was surprised at how he had each car I wanted to see lined up and ready to go for me. He had every single detail down of the car and every spec that I needed to know. He answered all of my questions and made it super easy and clear for me to understand the whole process. I would definitely recommend Angel Bay and Aris Khairzada. Aris was on top of it as well when it came down to explaining the contract and finishing up the deal. Super fast process too! These guys don't waste your time and make it a really great experience. Thank you everyone at Dodge, but most importantly Angel, for making it possible to buy myself an AMAZING car! ",5

296,27-Jan-17,"My husband and I were helped by David Azizi.  He was entirely low-pressure and negotiated with us in a peaceful way which made us feel good about the transaction.

It was helpful to us to have brought in the internet ad, so we could look right away at the car we ended up buying.",5

He was AMAZING. When it comes to buying and committing my self to something I'm very undecided because I look at the pros and cons in detail. And mr azizi was VERY patient and very open to negotiate on the prices. I was changing my mind several times before I signed  because the deals that were  given to me were awesome, I can say I'm a difficult customer and he made no bad gestures at all.  He was not pushy, he gave his opinion as the dealer and we did not feel like we were being pressured at all. He did his job very well. It is know to walk into a dealership and being followed, being asked questions and not left alone, feels like a fish in a shark tank but in this situation we loved it because it didn't even seem he was there at all. I totally recommend to go see him for a great deal. Ask for mr. David AZizi",4.8

The sales team from sales person to management are rude, curt and will change deals on you at the very end. Can not trust anything they say. Stay away from this dealership. Got to Thousand Oaks to get a jeep product or got to another brand.",1
301,10-Jan-17,"I stopped by to look at the Ram Promaster City.  In the parking lot, I met Angel, one of the salesmen.  I asked to see the vehicle and he took me out to the lot and showed me different models, ranging from your basic cargo work model, to the more elaborate passenger model.  Took the vehicle for a test drive and ended up exploring pricing.  The colors available were blue and white.  Blue was too dark for me, and white was too plain.  Absolutely no pressure from Angel when I said I'd like to think it over, and requested he contact me, if more vehicle options become available.  A few days later, Angel contacted me, to let me know they had just received a Silver Ram Promaster SLT Van, and suggested I stop by to have a look.  I dropped by, liked the vehicle, and negotiated a reasonable price with Angel, and ended up purchasing the vehicle.  I never once felt pressured or uncomfortable.  Upon completing the paperwork, I was introduced to Evan, the vehicle delivery manager.  He was also great, taking his time to explain all the features and answering my questions without hesitation.   Thinking of buying a new car?  Go look up Angel and Evan.  They will take great care of you.  :)",5

306,19-Dec-16,"ANGEL BAY is the most persistent Sales Representative I have ever met in my entire life. This guy called and left messages on a daily basis. Angel Bay left this one message that said he would not stop calling unless I came in and took a look at the HUGE INVENTORY at CROWN DODGE. This guy ( ANGEL BAY ) is like a phone terrorist - he called and left so many messages that my husband and I said lets go in and at least meet this Angel Bay and look at their inventory. When we arrived Angel was busy helping another customer. Jordan SWEISS helped us out and we ended up buying 2 cars. I will tell you this the reason we came in is because Angel just kept calling and leaving messages. He was very polite and professional when leaving a message. Over all my husband and I are VERY HAPPY with both our NEW CARS from CROWN DODGE and the professional manner ANGEL BAY & JORDAN SWEISS conducted thru the entire process. I have to hand it to ANGEL BAY this guy is no joke with a phone. If I were to own a business I'd want this guy on my team making calls ALL DAY LONG - talk about an ASSET $$$$. 
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND CROWN DODGE and dealing with both ANGEL BAY & JORDAN SWEISS üòÄüòÄüòÄ",5
307,07-Nov-16,"I will say this about Angel Bay  - this guy is PERSISTENT and Angel called me every single day and has left a message saying he will not stop calling me unless I come in and at least look at the 2016 CHRYSLER 300. 
He has always left a nice and professional message. It's obvious he loves what he does and enjoys selling cars. You can tell because of his positive energy and his enthusiasm not to just sell cars but the way he treated me and my wife as well. I must say he has always carried himself in a professional manner as well. Talk about HOSPITALITY & AWESOME CUSTOMER SERVICE.
 Angel offered me coffee and this amazing COLD COKE A COLA in a bottle. I've never had a Salesman at any dealership treat me with such AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE. He also had some funny jokes that had my wife and I laughing so hard we almost choked on our drinks. It was a smooth experience and I will say this about Angel Bay - the guy has class and dresses well . Easy and a very simple buying experience. I would HIGHLY recommend CROWN DODGE and make sure you ask for Angel Bay. I will ensure to tell ALL my neighbors, friends, family  to go to CROWN DODGE and ask to speak to Angel BaY",5

309,04-Nov-16,"       I came in to Crown Dodge because a Sales Rep called  me everyday and I must say Angel Bay is a very very very persistent Sales Rep. This guy has called me so many times and left so many messages in regards to a 2016 Dodge Journey with 15% off the MSRP. Angel Bay said he will not stop calling me unless I came in to at least take a look. So I finally came in last weekend to take a look. 
       Angel Bay was very professional and I must say he made it very simple in regards to purchasing a car. He went over every little detail with the car and made buying a car fun and simple.
       I had my two little boys with me and they didn't eat dinner yet and Angel ordered pizza for them. While I signed the papers in finance Angel Bay ate pizza with them and watched TV with them and ensured they were occupied while I was signing papers in finance. Talk about AWESOME CUSTOMER SERVICE. Angel Bay is a Sales Rep that really showed me that he really cares about the people he sells cars to. Any one can tell he really enjoys what he does. My two sons told me Angel was so funny and I was surprised how fast my kids opened up  to him - it was obvious Angel is a father. He showed me his two kids and I can  tell he is an Awesome Dad too üòä. 
I had a GREAT EXPERIENCE buying a car from CROWN DODGE and HIGHLY recommend anyone reading this to go to CROWN DODGE and ask for
 Angel Bay. The Customer Service 
I experienced from Angel Bay was beyond any experience I've ever had buying a car. If more car dealerships had Sales Reps like Angel Bay they would sell a lot more cars. 
       Angel also called me the next day to ensure ALL was A ok with my New Dodge Journey. He also asked me if I would give him ALL 10's on a Survey. 
I'd give him and CROWN DODGE 12 's and I will tell ALL my family and friends to go to CROWN DODGE and request for Angel Bay = Best Car buying experience I ever had üòäüëç!!!!!!

310,31-Oct-16,"I came in looking for a Dodge Challenger. The first day I came in a Sales Rep named Max helped me out. 
He told me  I would need a Co signer since I had No Credit score and would be considered as a First Time Buyer which meant my Interest rate would be much higher than someone with established and a very good credit rating. I told Max I would bring my dad since he has excellent credit. I brought my dad in and we asked for Max. The Sales Rep Angel Bay said Max was off work and asked the receptionist to call him. 
The receptionist had no luck in getting in contact with him. I asked Angel Bay if he was willing to help me out since I was able to bring my dad in and my dad wouldn't want to come back at a different time. 
Angel Bay said no problem. Angel Bay was so full of positive energy. Angel had us laughing and what my dad and I liked about Angel was he made buying a car and he had us laughing so hard on the test drive and in the his office. Angel Bay really made the experience of buying a car fun and simple. 
I Love my New Dodge Challenger and I would HIGHLY reccomend CROWN DODGE & make sure you ask for ANGEL BYAY - he's a very GOOD SALES REP. and what we liked about ANGEL BAY was the fact he really took his time and answered every single question and was very professional yet super funny. 
My dad liked Angel because he showed a lot of respect towards his elders and was very polite and very professional. My dad couldn't understand why he needed to be on line one on the credit application
ANGEL explained it and finally it sank in my dads stubborn head. 
We enjoyed working with ANGEL BAY and HIGHLY RECOMMEND you ask for him when you go to CROWN DODGE üòä He keeps it simple and what a funny guy üòúü§ò

Angel asked what if we could get in a new vehicle and lower our payments with little to no money down would we be interested ? My husband and I said why not. 
Angel made it a very pleasant experience and kept everything simple. He wasn't pushy at all what my husband and I liked the most about Angel was he was funny and was very professional.

While hesitant to go to this specific dealer to look at much less purchase a vehicle, my family and I met Steve Nishimura who provided us with excellent customer service.

A great guy who was excellent with the service he provided, he gave us complete and truthful answers to our questions. ",4.6
326,23-Aug-16,"Saturday evening on August 20th I walked into crown dodge with hopes of getting a car.   I was welcomed at the door by your amazing receptionist. She was extremely kind. Shortly after arriving I was greeted by Angel Bay. I explained my situation of having to jog 3.4 miles to work and how I was in need for transportation. I mentioned how I was promoted and I had to make it to work and meetings. Angel Bay went above and beyond to meet my needs. He pointed out a perfect vehicle to fit my budget. With persistence Angel was able to work together with Jordan Sweiss to find an offer for me. When Jordan Sweiss approached me he spoke with compassion and made an effort to help. Jordan Sweiss ultimately gave me an offer I couldn't refuse and they got me into a vehicle to drive home. You have hard and caring workers in Angel Bay, Jordan Sweiss, Jarrod Thomas, and Aris Khaizada and the rest of the Crown dodge Ventura staff. Thank you for looking out for a member of the community.

He was able to give precise answers and what we liked most he wasn't pushy in any way. Very professional and knew how to show the value of the Jeep my sister liked. Angel Baylon made it very simple and answered all the questions we had. I co signed for my sister and Angel explained how if I did we would get a lower interest rate. My sister has always helped me so I was more than willing to help her. What we liked about Angel Baylon was he truly was genuine and could tell he was wanting to help us all he could in getting her the Jeep she liked. I must say Angel Baylon is GOOD at sparking your interest into reality. He was  very professional and made us laugh and smile. We felt good about the purchase and didnt have buyers remorse because Angel kept it simple and explained everything. I highly recommend buying from ANGEL BAYLON @ CROWN DODGE to anyone because he understands how a customer should be treated. We were treated well and he made us smile and laugh the whole time.
HAPPY CUSTOMERS!!!!!",5
332,23-Jul-16,"I came in looking for a truck. First Sales Rep was nice. I asked to speak to a U.S. MILITARY VETERAN for I am a U.S. ARMY VETERAN and I felt more comfortable talking to a fellow VETERAN. I met ANGEL BAYLON. I was impressed from the get go. This guy has much CLASS. He had me laughing the whole time. Not pushy in any way. Just chill and knows his product as well. To top it off the ICE COLD COKE a COLA  had me SOLD!!! 
I wasn't going to buy but the way I was treated is what pushed me over and I bought. ANGEL BAYLON is an OUTSTANDING SALES REP for CROWN DODGE. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND CROWN DODGE & buying from ANGEL BAYLON!!!!
I looked him up at the VA(Veterans Affairs) my good buddy works there and this guy ANGEL BAYLON is a WAR HERO. 4 Purple Hearts & a Navy Cross
(Medal right under a MEDAL of HONOR). I don't think CROWN DODGE understands the caliber of person this ANGEL BAYLON is made of. 
OUTSTANDING SALES REP & personas a whole.
Yes I saw the news as well but so what this guy is willing to die for you and your family so you can have your RIGHTS as an AMERICAN!!!!
You should say thank you to him and ALL VETERANS that are willing to put their lives on the LINE FOR YOU!!!!
GOD BLESS CROWN DODGE & ANGEL BAYLON!!!!!

333,16-Jul-16,fui aver unos vehiculos y el muchacho guero alejandro barrera me atendio.  al fin maneje una jeep de el 75 anniversario blanco.  me gusto y la quise comprar.  no tenia mucho tiempo pero alejandro trabajo con migo sobre varios dias para conseguirme el prestamo.  al fin me consiguio el prestamo para el jeep.  gracias alejandro por toda tu ayuda.  ,5
334,12-Jul-16,"My brother JOSHUA & I (BO BARRO) came in late after CROWN DODGE was already closed to take a look around. This Salesman was leaving but stopped and got out of his JEEP WRANGLER & introduced himself.
Mind you it was way past 930pm & he (Angel Baylon) was so nice and very professional & willing to help out while all the other sales reps were wanting to leave. That alone shows me ANGEL BAYLON really loves what he does. He took the time to show us cars that my brother was interested in. ANGEL BAYLON was the only reason we came back and bought a car. The guy was way cool, super chill & had us laughing. What we liked about him was he was straight up & not pushy at all. When we came back we asked for him but the Sales Rep RICKY G said he was busy. We bought because of how ANGEL BAYLON treated us the following night before and ANGEL called to follow up. We will tell everyone about CROWN DODGE & how ANGEL BAYLON treated us - the guy has class and carried himself with professionalism. In my book I feel if more car dealerships had Sales Reps like ANGEL BAYLON they would sell more cars - the guy is SOLID & will ensure to send business his way!!!!! üôÇüôÇüôÇüôÇüôÇüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç",5
335,12-Jul-16,"My expectation was low and not expecting what service and professionalism I received from Angel Baylon. Angel's ability to assist me with the purchase of my Jeep was unsurmountable to say the least. I really appreciate Angel as a great sales person along with being a war fighter as myself. Angel made me feel comfortable and confident in making the right decision with my purchase. I highly recommend my friends, family and coworkers to Crown Dodge Chrysler Jeep RAM of Ventura and I'm only saying this because of Angel Baylon he is a 5 star talent and I will never forget my experience purchasing my car and it's only because of Angels professionalism and just being a good person that anyone would have the pleasure of meeting.     Mike Snead ",4.8
336,30-Jun-16,I can't speak to the Sales or Parts departments experience but the Service Dept is the worse experience in trying to just schedule an appointment I've ever had. Called 3 separate times. Every time was put on hold for close to 15 minutes average. First time the connection finally just dropped. Other two calls the receptionist came back on and tells me there is nobody available to help me. How hard can this be?Noticed they asked what type of service right up front. Maybe when they know it's a Safety Recall you go to the bottom of the pack (no big money there for them). I live in Santa Barbara and they are the closest dealership to me but I'm going to drive the extra miles to Lompoc or Thousand Oaks rather than deal with these guys. ,1
337,18-Jun-16,"I went with my sister & Angel Baylon made everything simple and very pleasant. 
He listened to what my sister wanted and was very polite. Not pushy at all like most car salesman. I highly recommend Angel Baylon & CROWN DODGE. My sister is very happy with her Jeep & I will ensure to tell all my friends and family.
Angel Baylon is a Salesman with much class & Integrity. He called the next day to ensure everything was A OK and it was a very pleasant experience.
I recommend CROWN DODGE &  dealing withANGEL BAYLON was GREAT!!!!

339,25-May-16,"Let me begin with ASK FOR ALEX BARRERA first! Deal with no one else but him . 
My wife and I had purchased a Dodge Journey from him and took my 3 yr Son . He also had a blast. 
Alex gave us a tour of the dealership and had lot of answers. He is definitely knowledgeable even with vehicles that are not Dodge . 
This is an individual that i can tell loves what he does and loves to truly help people buy the vehicle they want. 
For the first time in a while I actually left the dealership not having regrets or questions and it's all because of Alex Barrera.
Alex is courteous , top notch customer service, ready and willing to help you ( connected our phones to blue tooth and gave us education on how to use our features .Kept us in the loop the whole time we were in negotiations with finance and even entertained our 3 year old. 
Amazing follow up the next day as well. 
Again BIG THANK YOU! Our family feels safe and has plenty of room in our third row Journey! ",5

344,21-Apr-16,Not sure if their sales guy Richard was just lazy or didn't care about selling us a Jeep. He didn't even try. We took our business to Lompoc where we are getting what we wanted and a great price too. ,1
345,11-Apr-16,they helped out very well and answered any questions we had with great attitude! We ended up with a lovely car and money left in our pocket,5
346,25-Mar-16,"I gave the excellent rating because of my experiance with Ivan! He was very helpful from all the accessories in the car to motor/transmitting questions, Ivan helped picking my new car easy it's almost like he already knew what car I wanted!",5
347,25-Mar-16,"I went in with an open loan and I knew I had a bit of challenging credit. Nissan and Volkswagen told me I could only get approved for a vehicle u Fer 10,000$. I went in and Ivan made it happen. I came out flouring on a brand new Mini Dodge Charger ""Dart"". Super fast n I love it ! ",5

351,15-Mar-16,"They lied to me too many times. They wouldn't give me any specifics about the amount I would be financing or leasing.I gave them specific amounts I would agree to, they said the worked it out to my terms only for them later to try to up amounts agreed upon and say that was what I agreed to but still wouldn't show how much in total the purchase was going to be. They tried to intimidate me and they condescended me constantly. They wouldn't really let me speak. They tried to get me to sign on the first truck I looked at even after I said let me look at a couple more trucks or cars, just horrible customer service. They don't care if you leave happy or not, they just want you to sign and go. Their finance department lied to me by telling me I could come to them to get my name off a cosign I got into there a couple years ago, only to be told they don't refinance there by the same guy who told me me to go to him to and all I had to do was sign some papers with the other person. I wasted my one chance to get away from that car because I trusted them. In every aspect I had a horrible experience here, I'm not saying I wouldn't buy a Dodge or RAM, but I will never go to this dealership again and am very displeased that I'm stuck with a  car from them.",1
352,14-Mar-16,I walked in to Dodge really scared bc I do not have credit & I knew they would turn me down. Ivan was my sales man he was very kind and Patience as I had him walking all over the dealer ship. Ivan made it happen I walked out with 2016 Dodge Dart.,4.6
353,11-Mar-16,"If there was less than 1 star I'd choose that, but unfortunately I can't. To start, these guys are extra pushy. I begged my bf to go somewhere else. But he loved this car on their lot. Kept saying they just couldn't go lower. ...till you show them TruCar price. Ok, that just shows that they operate like the stereotype of a car dealership. Get into finance. Guy says the first payment isn't due for 60 days. Fast forward 3 weeks and a payment arrives- with a due date of the next day! We call the finance guy. Says sorry, he'll get right on it, fix it, call back. We don't hear from him. We call back the next day. He's not in for a couple days. We drive down there. Boss says they'll make it right, will call us the next morning to let us know. Nope. By the next afternoon we decided to call the bank and explain what the dealership has done to us. THE BANK set the due date to honor what we were promised. The dealer NEVER called back. DON'T BUY FROM THIS DEALER, RUN, GO ANYWHERE ELSE",1.2
354,07-Mar-16,We are very pleased with Richard's service. He took the time and energy to try to help us. He kept his word and continued doing his best though out the process I recommend crown dodge. Thank you so much Richard. We are so happy with our new 2016 Dodge Ram! ,5

356,01-Mar-16,"We have been looking for a car for a while, not have much luck anywhere until we came here. We found what we were looking for at a good price. They worked well with us and came home with what we wanted. They gave us good customer service, we will recommend them to others.",5

359,18-Feb-16,"I always use to dread buying a car. With high pressure sales hawks hovering around you the entire time. We bought a new jeep yesterday, and David Azizi was awesome. No pressure at any time. He stayed close to us to answer our questions before and after the test drive. When we came back the next day to make the purchase, David tossed his lunch in the trash and came to our assistance. He has a great personality that all sales people could learn from. David is a pleasure to work with. If you are in the market for a used car, or a new Jeep or Dodge please drive to Ventura, and ask for David Azizi!!",5

361,17-Feb-16,"This is the day I thought would never come and had to trade my dodge challenger.

364,05-Feb-16,I finally conviced my parents to take me out shopping for my first car. We had a game plan that went out the window once we ran into Roberto Cardenas cuz he was the opposite of what we had experienced. He was easy going n talk to. He was listening to me instead of ignoring me like the rest . Of course my parents were gonna make the final decision for me. We'll be ready in a few months and I'll remind my parents to go back to crow and for sure ask for Roberto. ,5

374,06-Jan-16,"The general attitude within the Crown service department is less than personal.  The staff are friendly, but don't follow-through.  Given the weather circumstances, I was seriously concerned about waiting another day to retrieve my Jeep that was in for 4 recalls.  Brittanye met me for my vehicle check-in the night before my appointment, offered me a rental so that my wife and toddler didn't have to follow me down from Santa Barbara repeatedly, then ADDITIONALLY followed-up to make sure I could not only pick up my Jeep, but also return the rental through after-hours support before the big storm is expected to hit.  I couldn't possibly ask for better customer service.",5

376,31-Dec-15,"My husband and I went to Crown with different ideas about the vehicle we wanted.  Julius was extremely patient showing me many vehicles and I actually drove 6 different ones.  He listened to what we said about our needs and made suggestions and we ended up with the perfect vehicle at a great price.  Julius made the purchase so pleasant, with no pressure, and lots of patience.  His follow up to make sure we know about all the features on the vehicle and that we are completely satisfied has been excellent.   I would definitely recommend Julius Mojica.",5
377,31-Dec-15,"When I found this dealership, it had the exact charger in the exact color and configuration I was looking for. Other dealerships had sent me quotes but Julius was able to beat them all and get me an APR I liked.

383,15-Dec-15,"I was in a couple of weeks ago.  At first I felt like I was going to be hounded by all the sales like the Nissan store i was previously at.  Alejandro was the young man that approached me.  He smiled and said hello and gave me some space.  As we walked to some of the used cars he would graciously  talk to my grand kids and would make them smile. he tried to help me find the passenger van I wanted unfortunately they didn't have one.  I needed a 10 Passenger van for $15,000.  Even though he did not have what I wanted, he took the time to show me several other vehicles that I wanted to see.  I will be gladly be going back to speak with him.  He showed me that not all sales men are hawks.  Thank you Alejandro for helping me and taking time to do what most would not do.",4.5

Great dealership and excellent customer service!",5
386,13-Dec-15,"I bought a Jeep Cherokee through the Internet.  My transaction was smoothe, quick and easy.  After the test drive I was taken immediately to the financial manager for paperwork.  There was literally no waiting.  He even chased after me once paperwork was finished because he saved me an additional 500$.!  My only disappointment was in the delivery of the car.  It only had a 1/2 tank of gas that would barely get me home because I lived so far and the windshield was so streaked on the inside I could not see clearly on my night time drive home. I thought it was a foggy windshield, but it was a dirty windshield.  I was late for my sons birthday dinner so I couldn't turn around to ask for these things to be addressed.  But when buying a new vehicle I feel it should be delivered clean both inside and out and with a full tank of gas.  It's a simple courtesy that goes a long way and could have earned this dealership a 5 star rating.  ",4.2
387,12-Dec-15," My cars have been used and i was thinking of buying a new car and really thought it was hard but when i went to crown dodge i was approved by Richrd Padilla and he was with a smile and came up to me and asked me questions,, by the time you know it i was with a new car, everyone needs to see this guy....for a car.",5
388,12-Dec-15,"I was apprehensive about coming onto the car lot, but was pleasantly surprised and relieved with my experience.

395,05-Dec-15,"     I went in the other day to look for a car and I was helped out by Jose Luis Torres, He knows a lot about their cars and trucks they have to offer to the public.

He had genuine interest in my family and was very respectful.",4.6
396,28-Nov-15,"In a perfect world, new automobiles would never need updates or have factory recalls.  However, because ALL vehicle manufacturers have them, the best you can hope for is to work with a dealer who has the highest possible competence and integrity in fixing these situations when they occur.  

Crown Dodge's service department exemplifies this highest level of competence and integrity.  I recently needed to a factory-required update to my Dodge Ram.  My schedule was very tight for getting this done and leaving on a trip.  As always, Robert, Isabelle, and Terry handled my every need.  They took my truck in immediately, provided an alternative vehicle to temporarily use, and had my truck ready for my trip the next day.  You simply can't ask for any more efficient,  more professional, or more pleasant people to deal with.",5

I unfortunately didnt do my research before we decided to buy our first car together as a young married couple. I posted a review of my first experience with them about a month ago, but after I posted my horrific experience on 4 different review sites they decided to finally do something about our situation. Long story short- they sold us the wrong car to drive off of the lot. We asked for a V6 4x4 and we drove a 2016 Jeep Cherokee 4cyl off the lot. It wasn't until the next morning that our financial adviser pointed out that we were driving a 4cyl, which was NOT the vehicle I specifically asked for. I returned the vehicle less than 24 hours later and after being harassed by multiple salesmen as my husband and I walked across the lot due to the fact that we were already returning the vehicle, they told us I lost $10,000 in equity and there was nothing they could do for us. Not to mention they lied to us about the cost of window tinting, the rental car agreement for servicing, and the details of the car we drove off the lot. I had the financial manager give false information to us and thankfully my financial adviser educated me before I went in. I had to call Navy Federal representatives twice during the closing of our deal in order to prove that our financial 'manager' was dishing us negligent information. They called me back 4 days later after my detailed and explicit reviews were seen by the entire dealership and bought my car back at full price and I finally was able to drive my 2015 Jeep Cherokee Trailhawk off of the lot. I thought that I finally put my miserable experience to rest, but that was a joke of a thought within itself. I scheduled a detailing appointment with Cassie on Friday, November 21st.I told her in front of my husband that we are leaving for Tahoe next week so we need our car. She acknowledged the information I provided her and proceeded to schedule my detail wash appointment on Tuesday, November 24th. Well, it is November 24th without my car. I called Crown Dodge 4 times today asking about the status of my car. I dropped my car off at 8:45am this morning. At 3pm, they said they didnt even get to my car yet. I called back again and my service manager didnt answer the phone. I called again at 4:30 and my car still wasnt finished. I called again at 5:30pm and my service manager didnt answer again. My husband dropped me off for my friends funeral this even WHICH I LEFT EARLY FOR TO PICK UP MY CAR after service hours. I called them as I was walking away from the funeral to head to the dealership and they said my keys were not available for me to pick my car up that i dropped off to get a DETAILED WASH ONLY OVER A PERIOD OF10 HOURS. I am scheduled to leave for Tahoe at 6am tomorrow with my husband. I am supposed to pick my family up along the way and get there in time for a scheduled event while my husband is taking leave before deployment. They once again said their famous words, ""I'm sorry Mrs. Cann, but there is nothing I can do for you."" I gave them the benefit of the doubt for fixing my car situation and took down my reviews on all of the sites, but this is the final straw. I am now being punished for the fact that not one person called my husband or me to tell us that the car would not be ready by the end of the day WHICH WAS IN FACT GUARANTEED TO US TWICE. I am now xxxx BENT on making sure I can continue to make sure I can pass our experience onto others so prevent them from buying and servicing at your dealership. I already called the Better Business Bureau once and I will be doing it once again tomorrow morning along with contacting Crystler. You have wasted enough of our time. I will be seeing you guys first thing tomorrow morning.

398,25-Nov-15,"After getting a quick appointment for my car my car was returned, dirty, scratched and the steering wheel and seat had been readjusted.   Also, my left front tire got a low pressure warning half way home.  When I went to the garage later it smelled like oil so I opened the hood and noticed some oil on the engine cover.  When I touched the cover it fell off.  I turned it over and found that the foam had been turnout and replaced.   I then decided to look around the engine and saw that one of the electrical plugs were not attached correctly.  And to top it off there are fresh scratches on the side near the hood.   I had just spent the past weekend dealing the car and there were no scratches where there are now.    I have sent an e-mail to dodge and I am waiting to hear back form them.

Sincerely,

399,24-Nov-15,"My wife and I had a wonderful experience looking for a new car. We went in because of TV advertising and there sales person was knowledgable about all of our questions. Jorge was friendly, courteous and polite. He never pushed us to do anything. We test drove a number of cars, asked lots of questions and picked a new Grand Cherokee. My wife had never had a leased vehicle. Jorge answered all her questions in a manner she could understand. We chose a lease because it suited our needs better. Thank you Crown Dodge and Jorge schweizer.",5

I certainly can say they have excellent service, friendly employees, and have so much to offer. I am looking forward to purchasing my daughters first car there! My husband works at Honda In San Francisco, but Crown Dodge Defanitely is a very professional and has such a great environment!

I always wait till the L√°st minute to do that because of bad experiences that i had in the past with dealing with different type of salesperson. The only thing  that i could day is that i was lucky to meet Roberto C√°rdenas at Crown Dodge and talk about someone taking the time to listen to all my needs and Wants on my New car.

403,15-Nov-15,"I called to explain I just paid 1500.00 to have a major tune-up on my
Chrysler 300 touring edition and after a few days of driving my vehicle
it began to knock and I found out it had zero oil in it.  I put in 5 quarts of oil.
It does not leak and the cap was on.  whoever serviced my car screwed up.
We are all human. Mistakes happen.  I paid $185.00 to replace the A/C & Heater
dial inside my car (cosmetic stuff) it looked old.  The part never came in?? I 
called the GM to tell him about my oil.....He said that type of service does not 
include an oil change. You have to request it? $1500.00 for a major tune-up and
an oil change is not included? Okay?  So where is my A/C part I paid for? Its only 
been 6 months? We will call you when it comes in,  He hung up on me before I 
could respond.
It's been over 1 year.  No one has called me,  I called three times before talking to
the GM. CSI used to mean something at dealerships. I know it still matters to
Leo Bunnin.  I wonder if Crown knows who is representing his Dealership on is 
behalf.  I couldn't get through to him and I'm still out my $185.00 and my vehicle has
never been the same after the knocking sound.  The Service Writers are always changing
Zack is no longer there and the two after him are not there. The GM's name is not listed

404,05-Oct-15,"I went in tonight to look at the dodge ram that was in the paper and online for 25K(new after rebates). I told the sales guy what I was looking for and he showed me what trucks where the 25k ones and took it for a test drive and came back and he asked if we could run some numbers. We went inside and he took down some information and told him that I did't want my credit ran and told him what it was since I was just at Toyota a month before(just wanted a rough estimate).....He came back and handed me off to his manager because he had another client that was interested in a car. The manager sat down and said that the truck was 35K. I told him that the paper and online said there were rebates that brought it down to 25k not 35k. He said that the only rebate he could give me was a $1500 credit....I explained to him that's not what the paper said and he said ""well if I could give it to you for 25K I still cant get it where you want the payments ""(acting like he was doing me a favor for giving it to me for what its advertised for). I told him that I understand that but wanted to run some numbers and see where we end up but he wanted to run my credit and he said ""if you don't help me why should I help you(being very rude at this point). I told him that I just wanted to run numbers but if it didn't work out that's fine and I just wanted my keys back so I could leave. He couldn't care that he lost this dealership money.  I have bought 7 cars from Toyota and have always been treated right. Toyota has always given me estimated number without looking at my credit(I even gave them my credit score so they could work with numbers). I should have listened to the yelp reviews and stayed away.

""Since purchasing my 2014 Ram Truck from Crown, I could not ask for better treatment from their service department.  Terry, Robert, Isabel (and Brittanye) have repeatedly gone out of their way to provide excellent mechanical help and the best possible customer service.  I've found all of them to be honest, professional, highly competent, and consistently expressing high integrity.  This has held true for everything from occasional phone calls, to routine services, to fixing recall items.  As someone who is not mechanically minded, I'm at the mercy of service departments, who could easily take advantage of me if they chose to.  Without exception, I've received the best possible treatment, and I feel that my trust in Crown Dodge's service department has been well placed.

I appreciated my experience!",4.6
412,03-Aug-15,"To those interested, this is a review still in process, the final rating and experience will be posted at the conclusion of my discussions with the dealership. I am starting with three stars because I see from previous posts that the dealership is making an effort to correct matters with other customers' issues and I would like to give them the benefit of the doubt until I have reason to state otherwise.

My issue pertains to my negative experience with the service department, in particular how I was given false information, How after paying $995.00 ransom my car was worse off than how it was when I brought it to them, how no one ""had authorization"" to address the matter on the Saturday I was there, and how telephone calls the following Monday with the Service Director were fruitless and in my opinion full of cover up.

Thank you for reading, I hope I have some positive news to share soon.

**(update 8/5)**

I'm pleased to share that I have been MORE than fairly taken care of by the dealership.

Keep in mind these companies are made up of teams of people, and individuals can make mistakes (I know I've made my share). A company's true character comes out in how they deal with such mistakes, and I can say that in my case, Crown Dodge showed genuine good character when I had the chance to talk to Terry Vasquez, their go to person for having your concerns addressed.

If I end up in the market shopping for another car I would prefer to buy here than another dealership, confident in knowing that if for some reason things aren't right, they'll fix it.

Good luck to the rest of you

413,03-Aug-15,Time to get a new car to replace old faithful.  Usually avoid dealing with sales people until I know what I want but I had some questions.  I met Diamond and he was very informative about the cars and features I wanted.    He helped me understand the difference between the models and I feel I made the right choice.  I really appreciated his help.,5
414,20-Jul-15,"In April of 2015, I went to this dealership to lease a truck.  The first person, Steve, was helpful and answered all of our questions.  When the opportunity came up of leasing a second vehicle we were pounced on by the (at that time) Sales Manager.  This was long and drawn out, but we ended up with two vehicles.  Both were supposed to have blue tooth and prior to leaving we were going to test all of the amenities to make sure all was in working order.  We were exhausted from the experience and ""believed"" that what they represented was what we leased.  WRONG. After several phone calls back to Crown Dodge, with no return phone call I was pretty disappointed at the absolute horrible customer service we received.  I pretty much wrote them off and let everyone I knew they were not reputable!!!!

Two weeks ago, I decided that  I was just going to drive the truck back and find out from someone what the heck was going on.  I was greeted by a host of sales people, and when I explained my situation the new sales manager came up and immediately pulled my contract and explained to me that, unfortunately, this was not what I actually leased.  Steam was coming out of my ears, then he called Warren who is the Director of the service Department.  Warren is and was wonderful. While I did not get what I believed I leased, he moved quickly to find a solution to accommodate my needs.  I needed to be Hands free for talking on the phone.  Again, it's not what I thought I paid for, but the customer service and Warren again, helped with a solution.  The former sales manager was either let go or left (no surprise here).  I was taking a long trip and made arrangements to have my car serviced and on the day of service I was greeted by two amazing ladies - Birttaney and Isabelle.  Bravo for you Crown Dodge for realizing women are customers too.  These two ladies know and have lots of information on vehicles, both go to school for auto mechanics and their knowledge is abundant.  What a pleasure to work with them!!  This review was for my most recent experience, not for my original experience.",4.6
415,17-Jul-15,I love this dealership! I met a guy named diamond who was an excellent car salesman. He knew so much about every car on the lot he was very informative and funny.

418,02-Jun-15,I went to crown to buy a car on the Internet price thinking it would be an easy process.  Come to find out the price includes all incentives and no dealer discounts.  I did not qualify for any incentives which no one could possibly qualify for all of them to get the Internet price.  This is false advertising in my opinion.  This is a bad business practice in my opinion.  Beware of the price they tell you cause it may not be what it really is.,1.2
419,25-May-15,"I bought a 2013 Dodge dart at the end of March. The vehicle immediately had transmission issues. I had to take the car back for service on 3 separate occasions.

Horrible customer service and truly the worst experience I have ever had in my life. ",1
420,18-May-15,"I went to Crown Dodge in Ventura and Angelito Baylon was the Sales Rep who really helped me out. He was very easy going and so down to earth. He had my 2 kids and I laughing so hard that we almost peed in our pants. Great guy and was very informative about every vehicle we looked at. I wasn't ready to buy but will buy a car from Angelito when I get out of escrow. I found out Angelito is a US Navy Veteran as well and has 4 PURPLE HEARTS.
I must say how can you not respect that? A person willing to die for our rights as Americans. I highly recommend Angelito Baylon @ CROWN DODGE. So who ever is reading this review and you need a new car go to CROWN  DODGE and ask for Angelito. : - )

I inquired about a vehicle purchase a week ago.  In the contact form, I specified that all communication was to take place via email because I didn't want to deal with the never-ending calls and harassment.

They started calling me within four hours of the request.  They never replied by e-mail as instructed.  I went as far as to call back once and told them not to call.  The on-going harassment by telephone continued.

The on-going harassment was so bad that I had to stop my work day.  Go outside, call them back where I was greeted by ""Mike.""  I told him that they were previously told NOT to call back again and they had violated that demand.

""Mike"" proceeded to call me ann ""xxx-hole"" and hung up on me.

I don't know about you... but I refuse to deal with that type of business.  STAY AWAY and buy your vehicles elsewhere.  I know I won't be buying any vehicles from CROWN DODGE.",1
453,30-Jan-14,"Update to my review below: Service center called and fixed the dent in my door.  Dave Weber is a class act and very personable and knows how to provide great customer service.  So all in all, I would go back and use the service center again.  One rude person doesn't represent the entire dealership.



Stay away from the service department!

They are slow, rude, lack customer service skills.

After I spend close to $40,000 on a car from Crown, I was told I'd get 2 years of maintenance.  FALSE.  You get 4 services, so if you use those up in one year, that's all you get.  They call you, hound you, to get go in for service every three months so you can use your services quicker than the 2 years.

Also, the courtesy wash is a joke.  I ask every time if I will get the courtesy wash, and they say yes.  Each time they call me and tell me the car is done, I confirm if the wash was done, they say ""Its getting washed as we speak.""  When I show up, do you think it's washed?  Never.  FOUR times the same thing happened, and by the time you pick up your car you just want to leave the place and not wait for the wash.

MY LAST STRAW was when I took my car in a few weeks ago and it was given back to me damaged all down the side, scraped and dented.  The service technician even wrote me a note saying that my car was perfect coming in and that it was damaged at Crown.  But, GEORGE says he will review the ""cameras"" and get back to me.  What do you know, the cameras don't show that my car was damaged so they wont fix it.  Do you think they'll show me the cameras?  Of course not.

How can a huge company like Crown not be able to pay out a few hundred to fix a customers car that spent close to 40,000 to buy a car there?

Stay away!  Go to another Dodge dealership!",3

457,28-Oct-13,Crown dodge has a diamond of a person in salesman Aris Khairzada. I bought my new 2014 Dodge Ram RT from them. The best part of all this is the next morning after buying P/U I went  back to dealership and asked Aris for a little help with all the hip features of the truck. Aris spent 1 hour with me helping me with every detail. Especially all the new high tech stuff Aris made easy and understandable for an oldewr guy like me. Tell Aris thanks soo much I will tell all my friends and fanily to ask for him if they want any vehicle from Crown Dodge youe guys are great Thank you Herve Favre-Felix Ventura Ca a happy new truck owner!!~!~,5
458,18-Oct-13,I walked into crown Dodge because I received an email from Aris. I just so happened to be in a sticky situation with a previous vehicle that I needed to get out of. ARIS was there to help me. He has been very understanding and extremely helpful since the start of the whole process. ARIS is not your ordinary pushy salesman. It was a pleasant experience to work with a salesman that was pushy and breathing down your neck for a sale. While working with ARIS I never once felt pressured to make the purchase. As a matter of fact I walked away from the deal the first day I spoke to him to rethink my agenda and talk it over with my parents. Those few days away were stress free because ARIS was NEVER pushy and I did not feel pressured. I came back to Crown dodge for ARIS. My next car will be from crown dodge and hopefully by ARIS again. I will recommend ARIS from crown force to everyone I know looking for a new car! Thanx ARIS for continuing to go out of your way for me. Your awesome!!! ,5
459,14-Oct-13,"We were first very impressed that almost immediately after we made an internet inquiry we received a phone call from Aris Khairzada to follow up on the inquiry and set up an appointment to visit the dealership.  Once we got to the dealership everyone was very friendly and welcoming.  We expressed exactly what we wanted and he tried to accommodate us as much as possible.  Unfortunately the numbers were not seem to work in our favor nonetheless Atis and Noee Ortiz who also step in with the sale, kept exploring the options so I would be able to take home the car I wanted.  I must say although I didn't end up getting the car color I had my heart set on, I ended up taking a much better option for me.  I thank both sales representatives for their patience and friendliness.    ",5
460,07-Oct-13,"I was interested in upgrading my Accord Coupe to something bigger. I wasn't exactly sure what I was looking for but i thought the new Jeeps looked nice. Aris was very paitient and showed me a ton of options. He was an expert on all the different models and trims and he even showed me options that were way under my budget just to make sure I wasnt paying extra for stuff I didnt really need. I ended up deciding on which car I wanted (Jeep Wrangler Sahara) and we started discussing the price. I had called a few dealers prior to get an idea of what I should be expecting as far as the price. His initial offer was already lower than the quotes I got from other dealers so i was very happy about the price.

All in all, he was very friendly and took the time to understand what I was looking for and did not try to push me towards expensive options that I wasnt interested in. The price was very fair and I didnt feel pushed to make a decision right away. I would be happy to work with him again.",5
461,04-Oct-13,Came in not really wanting to buy that day. Met Aris (really nice guy). Told me how it was and what he can do...made it really easy for me. Now I am a new car owner! Thank you ARIS!!!,5
462,19-Sep-13,"Worst sales experience ever - we tried but didn't end up buying at Crown. But still....If you're gonna buy a Dodge, make sure you have a good alternative for service besides Crown Dodge. I tried their service department today, and wasn't pleased. then I discovered that after my unpleasant experience, their service department (which was unable to perform the warranty service my car needs) found the time to put a Crown Dodge license plate cover on my car without my permission. I took it off immediately. Now I'm wondering what to do with the license plate cover. Any ideas?",1.8
463,19-Sep-13,I had a wonderful experience at this dealership. I went to a few other dealerships before I ended up at this one and I am so glad I ended up here! All the employees I dealt with while buying my new Jeep were fantastic and nice. I would recommend this dealership to everyone and anyone who wants a good deal without the BS. Thank you again! ,5
464,29-Aug-13,The Sales People need to have more experience and knowldge of the product they are selling.  They are thiefs and cover for each other on scams!!!  ,1
465,08-Jul-13,"Went in looking for a charger, they didn't want to work with me on price and told me i wouldn't get what i wanted on my trade in. I went to nearest dodge dealer and was complete opposite. I wouldn't recommend to friends or family.",1.4
466,07-Jul-13,Worst dealership ever! I've purchased 5 cars in the past years. Each single time the service has declined.  The dealership lost out on 100k in the last year from me because they want to sell me what they have and not what I wanted.  Needless to say i will never recommend anyone anyone to this dealership.,1
467,20-Jun-13,The poor rating is based on waiting inline for service more than 30 minutes after all vehicles infront of me had a visit from a service writer and their transactions were completed.,1
468,16-Jun-13,"I went to crown Dodge after I was in an accident and my car was totalled. They totally took advantage of the fact that I was a woman and needed a vehicle asap. They were so friendly acting like gentleman but it was all an act. The salesman Evan told me that the Jeep I was looking at came with a warranty and free service for 4 years and it was included in the price. Well now 3 weeks later when I am fixing a mess THEY created in financing, I realized they charged me over 3 thousand dollars for that service. My bad for not reading their contract with a fine tooth comb but morally, they are disgusting. Typical salesmen attitude only care about making the sale on the most money they can. I will never go back to this dealership and recommend people stay away too.",1.8
469,07-May-13,Mr. Amilee is a great salesman! He made my Jeep purchase very enjoyable. He was very helpful and not to pushy. He let me know that if I have any issue to feel free to call him and he holds true to his word! Crown Dodge has a wonderful salesman. ,5
470,26-Apr-13,I would definitely go back this was an excellent experience and Jordan treated us so good and made our buying exp one we won't forget! Who ever is looking to buy go see Jordan !!! ,5
471,19-Apr-13,Great and knowledgable salesman as well as great customer service. I got a good price for my trade in and a good price for the new jeep I bought.,5
472,10-Apr-13,"     I recently purchased a 2012 Dodge Ram 1500 from Crown Dodge with David Azizi as my sales representative. David did everything possible to make sure our transaction went smoothly and that we successfully agreed upon a sales price for my new vehicle. Having personally purchased several other new cars in the Ventura County area I would have to say that my experience with Crown Dodge in Ventura was very pleasurable and I do plan on highly recommending them in the future. 
     My only complaint with the dealership would be the fact that although very professional about their jobs; several of the sales department remained standing just outside the reception area smoking cigarettes. As an ex-smoker myself I understand their needs, however if my wife and children had been at my side during the transaction the situation would have been not looked upon very favorably by them. 
    

                                              Great job Crown Dodge, I look forward to seeing you again!

475,29-Mar-13,"Aris worked with us to get us what we needed.  I enjoyed his proficency.  I would recommend him as an agent to family and friends.  While we were at the dealership several men seemed to be constantly standing around smoking and ""hanging out.""  Had I not been there to meet with Aris, just walking onto to the lot on my own, I would not have felt welcomed or comfortable.  ",4.2
476,28-Mar-13,"Willie handled my negotiating over vehicle and price professionally and I never felt like I was being pushed to purchase anything I did not want.  I will admit I am difficult to deal with as my decision took several days and Willie displayed good patience and never ignored my request.  He answered every question and informed of many features in my new vehicle that I wasn't aware of.  I felt I was given a excellent deal on both my trade and new vehicle.  Crown's finance staff was organized and efficient, when all the negotiating was completed finance was able to get me in and out during my lunch break without cutting any corners on explaining the terms of the purchase along with extended warranty offerings.  In the end great dealership, felt like I was a part of the process.",5
477,27-Mar-13,"Great dealership. I felt very welcome as soon as I arrived. The sales associate I worked with was named Aris. He was very friendly and very patient. He really took the time to understand my needs, and his knowledge of their products and services was outstanding. Buying a car is so stressful, but I felt very comfortable working with Aris. He didn't try to pressure me into buying just any car.. Instead, he took the time to really listen to what I needed to better understand which car was perfect for me. I highly recommend this dealership to anyone who wants the best customer service. Be sure to ask for Aris! He's sooooo helpful. ",5
478,24-Mar-13,"From the beginning Aris was very friendly and informative. He answered all of my questions and really made me feel like he was on my side and would do anything to make sure he met all of my needs to get the best possible price for me and he did!!!! I also loved his personal stories and insights about him which made Aris very accessible and approachable. I've been to other dealerships before in the past where I was purchasing a car, and the salesmen were always just going through the motions and were very ho hum. My experience with Aris was the best car buying experience ever, bar none. ",4.8
479,24-Mar-13,"I would like to thank Aris Khairzada for all his help, he made my car buying experience a true pleasure. He went out of his way to find me the car i wanted, he listened to our concerns, and he kept his promise on all aspects of the sales process. I really appreciated him handling the transaction from beginning to end. 

Aris Khairzada is a true sales professional, we recommend him highly!!!

482,22-Mar-13,"My experience with Jordan Sweis was the BEST experience I have EVER had at a dealership. He was very knowledgeable of the vehicle I purchased. Not only that, he went above and beyond to get me into the truck that I wanted and for the price I wanted. He made it happen! If you are in the market for a new car I HIGHLY recommend Jordan. He really made me feel like family, that's how much he helped. EXTREMELY happy with everything at Crown Dodge! 

I dealt with Joe in finance. He is AMAZING as well. He also went above and beyond to do everything he could to help me out. 

I wont go anywhere else now when I am in the market again to buy a new vehicle. 

OUTSTANDING GUYS! ",5
483,02-Mar-13,"I have given this rating due to the way I was treated in the service department. I took my jeep into this place for warranty work. I was informed they would check out my jeep and call the warranty company and give ma a call by the end of the day. Two days later I had to call and was given some run around and was told there was a Chrysler bulleton out stating the jeeps were installed with faulty trans filters and that this would fix the problem. They made it sound like it was going to be covered it was not. 3 day later I had to call again and find out the status of my jeep now and again was given some run around saying they could not duplicate the problem and would I mind coming down to show them. Took off work early and took jim for a ride and duplicated the problem. 4 days later I had to call and find out the status and I was told they couldn't duplicate the problem that I had shown him 4 days earlier. I informed jim to stop all work and I want my jeep back and that I need it by Wednesday night at the latest he said fine and that he would do it and call me. Wednesday night no call Thursday no call until Thursday afternoon jim calls and says the jeep is done. The total is way to much for something that was played off as warranty. 
So I spent 13 days without a car due to jim not calling warranty right away so they could issue me a rental. This is why I purchased the extended warranty. Now after paying the high bill I get my jeep home and look under it to find the transmission pan is leaking transmission fluid as well as the front shock, control arms (upper and lower) as well as the half shaft and inner fender have a bunck of grease and oil all over them.
Unethical, sloppy mechanics.",1.4
484,14-Feb-13,"Anything past the excellent service I recieved from Ricky (salesman) has been HORRIBLE.  Crown has a new location, but the same bad service as their original location 15 years ago.  I should have never thought that this dealership would have changed.  All the sales guys (except Ricky) stand in front of the entrance and smoke, so when you try to walk into the building, you smell like you've been in a casino or bar all night.  The dodge durango citadel is a beautiful car, but I'd rather drive a beater then to have to deal with that dealership for the next 4 to 5 years.    ",1
485,26-Jan-13,"I'm Lucky that I did not get killed driving the unsafe 2009 Jeep Rubicon they sold me for an over inflated price.

The Sales Manager said this is a Chrysler Certified Per-Owned Vehicle that they spent $2,000 getting it Certified. After numerous break downs and phone calls, I found out it was not a Chrysler Certified Per-Owned Vehicle.

Some of the problems:
Broken rear track bar bracket, axle could fall off and roll over vehicle.
Wheel lug nut where undersized and wheels could have fallen off.
Dislocated rear axle spring.
Rear Sway Bar rubbing through break lines.
Transfer case shifting cable broke first time tried to use it.
Transfer Case is bad and needs to be replaced.
Oil press sending unit was bad.
Bad oil leak.
and a few other items.

The sales manager agreed to give me $3,000 off, then changed it to $2,000 on the contract without telling me. When I found out it was too late.

I got this 2009 Jeep Rubicon about 6 weeks ago, I have not been able to drive it for the past 3 weeks because it's unsafe to drive.

A few weeks after buying this Jeep I found Crown Dodge where running ads $1,000 less than what I had paid for it, I believe this is unlawful along with some other unlawful things they may have done.

I've been back to Crown Dodge over 20 times trying to straighten this out and just get the run around. This jeep has been it their shop 3 times and I have talked to half a dozen people there.

Also tried taking it to another Dealership, They did not want to touch it with all of the problems it has.        

This Dealership Needs to be Shut Down Before Someone Gets Killed!

489,10-Oct-12,"I was looking to get a 2012-2013 Charger SRT8. I contacted about 10 different dealerships, all with the same details: Give me your best price possible and I will buy a car from you today. Also, see what deal I can get on my 2010 Challenger RT. I was contacted by Richard Schwartz since I posted on the internet. We went back and forth. At once, I thought he was rude through email but its hard to tell if he meant it like the way I took it or not, so I brushed it off. I told him, here is a quote on the best price I have been able to find. Also what the best offer on my car as a trade in. He said, I can beat it, just come down to test drive the car and drive home in it. He said, come as soon as possible since I like to leave early since I have the day off. I said I will be there before 5. I even left early so Richard wouldnt be held back too much longer.

I get there and I notice the car isnt where it has been for the past few months. He said, oh, its been moved. We walked around for 10mins. He said, let me see if its somewhere else. I waited in his office for about 10 more mins and he came in to tell me it had be sold. OK, that happens, not happy, but I understand, you can always get another car. Then I am told the price I showed them wasnt going to happen. That it was a low-ball offer and no dealer could ever do that price. I didnt tell him it was a friends dealership that I have done business with in the past, I just told him and some other manager that I have gotten 10k off previous yr SRT8s. I wasnt even looking for that type of deal. Was told I dont know what Im talking about and Im pretty much smoking crack. 

Then as I am trying to leave and get my keys since they tested out my car to see what shape it was in, another manager told me pretty much teh same thing Richard did. Im a liar, dont know what Im talking about, blah blah blah. Well, Im never doing business there again.

I have been bringing my car there for a yr for service and had very good experiences with them, but after this, I will be driving 30miles somewhere else each time I need an oil changed or any warranty work done on my Challenger.

Another manager did call me to check up and see what the status was and from what she told me, this isnt the first time Richard has done this. If this is true, then why keep someone like that? If you know he is bad, why risk having a customer, like myself, be handled this way?",1

After hearing that I decided to close the deal. The next day (Friday) Luis called me and said he was leaving to San Juan Capistrano to get my truck. Luis called throughout the day to keep me informed of his ETA back to Ventura and this was very important as this was the only day (Friday) that my wife and I could get off from work and by Luis keeping us informed we could plan our day off and not waste our time waiting at the dealership (lot's of traffic on Fridays down south in L.A. area).

506,21-May-11,"I took my vehicle to Crown Dodge starting in January/2011 after Chrysler instructed me to take it to a Dodge service center if I wanted potential assistance with unresolved issues with the car. The initial problem was in regards to an air injection code that had been in the vehicle since a little over a month after purchasing the used 2005 Dodge Stratus. After a little over a week, I was told that my car needed a new O2 sensor and then after opening it up they found that it also needed a cadillic convertor (spelling?). I agreed to replace these parts and the problem was still not resolved and I was up to about $3,000 in repairs. About a week later my service rep told me that there was a special emissions warranty on the car and that I would have to pay for any of those repairs. My car was at Crown Dodge service center for 6 weeks. During that time I got very few updates on what was going on and I finally let them know I needed to go out of town and needed to know if I would have my car. I was told to pick it up and I drove to Nevada. When I got there, my car had an oil leak and the air pump was still staying on. I had to disconnect my battery every day to keep it from being drained by the pump. I called Sandy (my service rep) the day I arrived and she told me to bring it back when I returned. I remained there for 3 weeks and on my way home the dash was glitching (back defrost turning on and off, radio/clock turning on and off) and about half way home the odometer readings started flickering all over the place. I returned home on Saturday and took the car in Monday. I was told there were 2 oil leaks (cost almost $800) and I got those fixed. They told me the dash was flickering initially but they couldn't repeat it so come get the car and bring it back if it continues. I paid for the oil leaks (3 weeks later) and didn't even sit in my car before noticing the dash was flickering. I left the car and then was told that there was a ground issue and they were having trouble finding where it was coming from. Eventually I was told they found it and that cost me $225.00. After I picked up my car there was a loud noise coming from my engine (it was heard over my radio) and the car was still puttering at slow speeds and stops. I took my car back and Sandy advised me to take it to my mechanic to make sure it wasn't the transmission and to let her know what they say. I did that and then took it to a transmission shop, per my mechanic. They confirmed it was not the transmission and that you could clearly hear the noise form the engine. I called Sandy back and didn't get a return call so called again a few days later. I was instructed to bring my car back in to Crown Dodge, so I did and after a few days they called and told me it was a loud alternator (Sandy was not there and I got a new service advisor, Jeff). I told Jeff that I wanted to follow up with Chrysler because I didn't understand how there was a new issue with the car that wasn't there before. I also asked him about the puttering and her told me it may be a core issue inside the alternator, but they wouldn't know until they replaced it and also asked me to follow up with the service manager, David Weber, about my concerns. I left a message for David and never got a call back. I also called Chrysler and after them speaking to David, they agreed to pay for the alternator. After the repair was done, I picked up the car and to my surprise it was still puttering. I left and immediately called back to Chrysler. I also found that a rodent of some sort had been in my trunk (how I don't know) and chewed up some papers and a piece of the weather strip in my trunk. I called and spoke to Jeff on a Saturday and he asked me to leave a message for David on Monday, which I did and he again didn't call me back. Chrysler got a hold of David regarding the puttering of my car and I was asked to once again bring back my car. I did and now they are telling me it needs 4 new motor mounts and the car isn't puttering. I told Jeff not to touch the car because I wanted to follow up with Chrysler because it didn't make sense to me how it now has another repair that wasn't needed before and how the issue it has had all along that was never fixed, suddenly isn't there. He asked me to call David and I said he doesn't call me back so who else can I call. He said Stewart, a new service manager. I left a message for Stewart that Friday and surprisingly David called me back Monday. I explained to David my concerns about the recommended repairs because each time I bring it back there is something else wrong with it that wasn't there before. All he kept saying was ""you need 4 motor mounts"", over and over again. I told him not to touch my car and I was following up with Chrysler, which I did. My rep from Chrysler called me back after finally getting a hold of David and told me that David said they are recommending I replace the motor mounts, but based on the mileage and year of the car they didn't really have to be replaced and they weren't really worn down that bad. For this reason Chrysler said they couldn't authorize a repair that was ""needed"", which is why I questioned it in the first place. Chrysler has offered to send me to another dealership service center for another look. I picked up my car from Crown Dodge on Monday May 16th and attempted to file a complaint against David Weber and the woman I spoke to attempted to address my concerns by bringing David in to speak to me. This was a big waste of time, David told me good I was going to another dealership and I also let him know I had filed a complaint with the Bureau of Automotive Repairs and he said ""ok, good"". I told him I didn't understand how my car continues to have new problems every time I bring it in and how he didn't return 1 phone call I made to him, except that morning after I left a message for someone else. He just kept shaking his head at me. Then I asked him about the weather strip in the car and he told me to have the new service center access it and call Chrysler. I said ""so Chrysler is responsible for damages that happened to my car while at your service station?"" and he said ""yes"". I said that doesn't make sense, how are they responsible for damages that happened at your service station and David said because a rat couldn't get in my trunk. I said I don't know how it happened, but the damage happened while it was at his service station and he told me to call my insurance company and file a claim. I said, ok, so now my insurance is responsible for the damages and he said yes. I said that doesn't make any sense, the damage happened at your service center and he said ""I don't know what to tell you, it's an insurance issues. I told him he didn't make any sense and I needed my key. I was told it was in my car and he walked away. I continued to express my concerns with the 2 women at the counter and 1 informed me that David and another guy looked at my trunk and said it was normal wear and tear and a rodent didn't do it. I showed her the pictures I took before I cleaned the trunk (to make sure a rodent wasn't still in there) and a pillow case with the stuff that was chewed on was in my trunk for them to see (I don't know if David ever looked at it). In total I was without my car for about 13 weeks and was never offered a rental car, except for 1 weekend when I was dropped off to get my ""fixed"" car and had to leave it there for continued issues. I am insulted by David's lack of returning any of my calls to him and his response to any of the concerns I presented to him and my service reps. My car is still not fixed and I have to take it to another service center this upcoming week.   ",1.6
507,20-Jul-10,"Salesman was more interested in what was happening to the USC football team then selling me a car.  ""Look at what's happening to USC...awful isn't it?""  No.  What is awful is this dealership.  Crummy selection and worse the whole team there seemed like the ""used car dealers"" that we have all been warned about.  Didn't bother to buy the car there.  Neither should you unless you want to hear about the over rated antics of USC.   Epic FAIL.....",2.6
