It is easier for me to explain myself to Jasmin Lawson at Oxnard Toyota, she is very understanding and excels in customer service with a personal approach.  I did not have a very good experience when I first bought my car there, but the manager made sure that my next visit I would be  assisted by their very best. Jasmin is a pleasure to work with and I feel extremely comfortable talking to her and I feel she excels in the way she deals with customers.  ",4.8

2,"January 01, 2020","Worked with Mr. Al 'Captain' Gaines at the dealership. The deal went through so smoothly. They don't play games like many other dealers. He told me my 'out of gate' price, followed by negotiation and purchase. Smooth and good deal.  ",5.0

4,"December 28, 2019","Have a 2003 Sequoia and have had it serviced and repaired at Oxnard Toyota since it was new. We had trouble getting it out of 4 wheel drive after a trip to the mountains and thought we blew the transmission or differential actuator or something expensive as we could not get it into any gear, it would not move. Called and spoke to Juan Arriaga and he stayed with me on the phone while I tried out his suggestions and IT NOW RUNS PERFECTLY!  A simple fix And it did not cost me a cent, he made our New Hear happy! Thank you Juan. ",5.0

6,"October 07, 2019","Can't reach anyone to schedule service or to get questions answered regarding warranty. Called the Finance department several times, no answer but was able to leave two messages. Yet days later, no returned call. Emailed twice no response. Meanwhile, this dealership sold us car finding out later that all four tires were too small and definitely not for that car, which eventually forced us to have to replace all tires. All of these issues seemed to have now compounded making me realize that the dealership is only trying to make the next sale, and not interested in taking care of existing or prior customers. Perhaps I am taking this all out of proportion, but how would anyone else feel if they can't seem to get anyone on the phone or anyone to call back, not to mention the other issues that we are having with the vehicle.

8,"June 27, 2019",Sales department of course was great. Once they hook you and shake on the deal your pretty much at the bottom of the priority list. Been a few weeks and Finance department hasnt paid off my trade in but has already been sold at auction. Dont know how that is. Anyway trying to get a hold of Tim in Finance is close to impossible. Try another Toyota dealer do yourself a favor.,2.2
9,"June 22, 2019","I started my look for a Toyota approximately one month ago. I found their ad on CarGagus, cars.com, and had a terrible experience. They added on a anti-theft on for $895 and said it couldn’t be taken off.. How could I trust a company like this.",1.0

After reading some of the other reviews I can see this is business as usual for this place.  Shady sales practices...and then when you try to resolve they say bring the car in and they will buy it back.

This place is terrible.  Would not recommend it to ANYONE.

I purchase a car and they really up sold a door protective wrap.  If you are getting that pitch do buy.  they are literally $15 from 3M and the up sell for $500.  That should have been my first clue what these guys are all  about. ",1.0
12,"May 07, 2019","Stay away from DCH Toyota

These guys are real CON artists in the car sales game.  If you just can pass up a deal they are offering be VERY wary of the bait & switch they play.

They scammed me out of $500 which fortunately was not a huge amount but I will never go back there again!!!

After reading some of the other reviews, a lot of similarities on how this guys operate.  STAY AWAY

If you have a choice definitely recommend you look elsewhere….",1.0

15,"December 13, 2018","About 6 months ago, I found a Subaru I wanted at this place so I went in to make the purchase. The sales rep we had was actually nice and relaxed (Jose Leon, super nice guy) but once we went inside the sales team leader (Richard Abboudd) was absolutely terrible. He talked really fast and was acting very manipulative, completely overwhelming me, my mom and even Jose. When he brought out the numbers, there were multiple high dollar charges he tried to sneak under my nose (engravings on the window, maintenance agreement, key scratch guard, xxxx I didn’t need), AND HE KEPT TRYING. He would come back with the charges gone, but would add a super high increase on the interest percentage and vise versa. (I should have just left right then...) 
I purchased the vehicle and left the lot semi happy with the price I got it for. Not even a mile down the road, the check engine light comes on. Awesome..
I took it back immediately and they said “oh it’s nothing”, and literally just reset the light. I had to take it back 6 TIMES over the course of 2 and a half months or more, and they were never able to fix it. The car was even sent to Subaru twice and they also said they couldn’t fix it. (It was an electrical problem, multiple sensors kept going out). I met the sales manager (Drew Holbrook) and he said “If we can’t fix it one more time, we will take the car back from you.” He was super nice and understanding at first. He wanted to “help me out and make it right”. 
Of course the light came on 2 days later. So I took it back, and guess what, the manager Drew proceeded to ignore me for about 2 weeks no matter how hard I tried to see him. Finally I went in and spotted him hanging by the coffee. (Got you now!)
Drew literally said, “I know we sold you this car which seems to have faulty sensors and electrical problems, but you drove off the lot with it, it’s yours. So the best we can do is a trade-in”... ARE YOU JOKING??? I’m about to loose a ton of money. I would have completely lost the $5000 down payment I made, as well as have to now owe $6000 on my financial loan. I was blown away by his response. Ya, I drove it off the lot, but the xxxx check engine light IMMEDIATELY came on, AND this was a certified vehicle!! He didn’t care. He was not budging.
We left in a rage, trying to look at legal aspects, but decided that wasn’t the route we wanted to take if we could avoid it. We went back to try to spark a better deal and I ended up getting a used Camry with a good warranty thrown in without loosing too much on the TRADE-IN I had to make.. xxxxxxxx.. If I would have just come in and purchased the Camry with the $5000 down payment I had, my payments on the car would be lower. So I still lost a lot of money after all said and done. The only reason I decided to take the Camry was because of the good warranty they decided to throw in. (Could have still been a better warranty but I was so tired of fighting) 
Oh and it also took them 3 months to finally take the Subaru off my name at the dmv so that was also a hassle. Luckily, the Camry has been running good with little to no problems. And I’m very happy with it. 
Just when I thought the hurt was over, the other day I wanted to use the coupon I got for “first maintenance visit 50% off”, so after my first 7,500 miles or whatever I go to schedule my maintenance. But guess what? They put a 60 day expiration on it. 
Oh, so you just do that so no one can ever really take advantage of this offer because no one is driving that much in 60 days..(They wanted to charge me $160 for oil and tire rotation). 
I hope I never have to go back to that place ever again...",1.2
16,"September 23, 2018","We looked from Alhambra to Ventura for our new Prius.  I was lucky enough to speak to Elijah Willis at Toyota of Oxnard. His deal beat the others by $3000  (Alhambra Toyota’s best deal) all the way down to $700 at Toyota of Simi (next least expensive to Oxnard).  But in spite of the great deal this dealership rocks. It’s beautiful, clean, with helpful people everywhere.  Elijah (Sales Mgr) turned us over to Christian Sosa for the nitty gritty, finding the car, test drive, feature demo, paperwork, etc.  Between these two gentlemen I was ready to buy another new car for my wife.  These guys are awesome.  And then you get into the dreaded Finance Office.  Andres was great.  My son who was buying the car had maxed out his budget so he couldn’t add anything on other than the extended warranty and Andres just made sure we understood the other options and kept moving.  Christian delivered the car sparkling clean with a full tank of gas and began the lengthy description of all the hi tech features in the Prius.  He set up the phone and basics to get us going.  I really can’t say enough about Elijah and Christian.  It’s almost unfair to us consumers when car dealers make buying a car so stress free and actually fun. If you’re looking for as great deal with people who understand the meaning of honesty and integrity, at a dealership that makes the experience something you’ll remember, go see these guys.   ",5.0

I have been bringing my TACOMA P/U for service since I bought it new from the dealership in 2001,  The truck is use as my daily driver and for pre-running/chase/Pit vehicle in desert races both in the states and Mexico, so my truck has to be in top condition.  Jasmin is very knowledgeable and is a straightforward regarding additional services or repairs my truck needs or may need.    I'm very happy having Jasmin as my service adviser and DCH of Toyota as my dealership of choice for my Toyota.

19,"April 10, 2018",Thank you Al for making my buying experience fast and easy. I’ve never gone to a better dealership and be in and out and in my new truck in an hour and a half. You want a salesman who doesn’t haggle give AL “CAPITAL “ GAINES a try . I guarantee he’ll beat any offer (within reason) you have received from another dealership . You don’t even have to leave the comfort of your home. Send him an email with a picture of your best offer and watch my man AL “CAPITAL “ GAINES blow your mind with his offer. Thanks again AL I would definitely recommend to anyone to give you there business. Keep up the great work 😎,5.0

I was coming back from a trip had luggage with me asked him to please have the vehicle ready for delivery. Super shuttle dropped me my wife and I off Albert Gaines had my vehicle ready we loaded the luggage went in and did the deal. Best buying experience I’ve ever had. He didn’t play the “let me check with my manager game” if you know what I mean. I was in and out within an hour and a half. My deal was as EASY AS PIE😎,5.0

28,"December 05, 2017","My buying experience could not have gone any more perfect! Talked to Matt Dimmit over the phone, he gave me a price (that surprised me to be honest), I called him up to confirm and I was on my way to Oxnard from Anaheim in the middle of Thanksgiving traffic mind you. He set me up  with Al Gaines, who couldn't have been more patient with me. Finally I met with a nice young lady by the name of Debra Dimmit who was very sweet and understanding. 

I was in and out in about an hour! Which is the fastest time frame I've experienced at any dealership by far. Why more people don't deal via the internet is beyond me. 

Oxnard Toyota had the exact truck I wanted and for the price I wanted. Once again, thank you guys for helping with the purchase of the truck I've wanted for a long time.

31,"December 03, 2017","COMMENTS BASED ON MOST RECENT VISIT ONLY.  
Although I didn't purchase my 4 Runner at Toyota of Oxnard I have always taken it there for scheduled maintenance because it is closer than the dealer I purchased it from. I have always had a satisfactory experience and Bob Cobos has always been great. However, this last scheduled service on 12/2/217 was unsatisfactorily. Mr. Cobos was not there that day so David Pat handled my service. The appointment was schedule for 9:00 AM. I checked in at 8:52 AM. Mr Pat told me that it take 1 1/2 to 2 hours to complete the service. I told him I would wait at the dealership. Needless to say 2 hours passed and Mr. Pat came through the waiting area several times and not once did he acknowledge that I was there waiting or offer a status update on my vehicle.    

2 more hours passed without a word when I finally went to the front desk to ask about my vehicle. To make a long story short, according to the invoice my vehicle was ready at 10:36 AM. I spent 4 hours waiting for my vehicle unnecessarily. Mr. Pat offered no apologies before sending me on my way. 

2 hours of my time wasted. If I return for service in the future I will certainly keep in mind that if the service adviser is David Pat I will request someone else or go when I know for sure that Bob Cobos will be there.

I always deal with Raymond Martin and he is AWESOME!!  I bring in my coupons and he'll find one that I can use on my service.  If things on my vehicle are starting to show signs of wear and tear, Raymond will bring them to my attention.  He understands that not everyone has the time or pocketbook to fix things at that moment.  He offers the customer a printout of upcoming maintenance that will need to be addressed in the near future.  I bring it home with me and then return when I have the money and time to drop off my vehicle.  The shuttle service is also outstanding.  The drivers are friendly and you meet some nice people to chat with while they are dropping people off at work or home.  If I do wait in the lobby, I can eat the fabulous cookies and enjoy the free WiFi on my device.  I don't take my car anywhere else.   Why should I?? ",5.0

He balled faced lied to me and told me ""the rebates were not for the car we wanted, but if we bought the extended warranty he would honor the rebate"" He is a THEIF and a LIAR.

41,"April 18, 2017","I inquired about trading in my 2009 Avalon that i bought from this dealership for a 2014 Avalon. When it came time to talk numbers these guys wouldn't even budge 30-50 dollars on the monthly payment...

 I have bought 2 vehicles from this dealership before. This would had been my 3rd time. I felt asking them to come down 30-50 dollars a month is not asking for anything unreasonable especially since I am a returning customer for the 3rd time. These sales people dont understand how to keep a customer happy and keep them a life long customer, which in the end they would had made back that money plus much more in customer  referrals and interest. 

Very unsatisfied this time around. It felt like a slap in the face . We ain't talking 100s here on a payment just 30-50 dollars. 

I was trying to be reasonable. Even after offering a reasonable down payment. My credit rating would be considered good to excellent.

I would not recommend buying from this place. They have lost my business for life over a very small amount here.",1.0
42,"March 30, 2017","Good afternoon John Hautman.. i purchased a 2017 toyota tundra trd pro this weekend and traded my 2012 m3 for this truck.. i test drove the truck and liked it.... we made a deal which wasnt the best of deals but i was ok with this purchase because i wanted the truck.. i got home and realized after driving it just for a few hours and it was a lil too big for me to live with and would not fit in my garage.. thats ""my"" fault i admit.... the truck had 22 miles when i bought it.. i returned the next moring and was hoping even though i know theres no cooling off period inwould be able to switch over to the white trd pro tacoma in the show room.. i asked Paul Panz who is a great guy and very helpful sales person so no shame on him... he is the only one i felt that tried to help me in this problem.... i asked Elijah Willis if there is any way that we could do the same deal on the tacoma trd pro as on the tundra.. he said NO.. ""no way he will do it"" he said its ur truck now and you should have thought of it. I agree for the most part but i didnt want to take my business elsewere.. both trucks were already highly marked up anyways because of the limited pro series witch im ok with.. i said is there anything he couldndo and he said we can trade it in for the tacoma.. we went over numbers and he came back with a ridiculous amount of money for this tacoma.. i just payed over 60 grand for this tundra and now it has over a 100 miles on it and he wants to give me 45 grand? Thats insane.. he said he coukd do the deal with 5 more grand down.. more money? Thats just too much insanity! I already got screwed and i didnt want to get screwd again.... i looked at the cement gray trd pro tacoma which Elijah said he can give me a better deal on this model cuz its a demo with under 1000 miles on it and he informed me you were driving this truck and thats why there are milage on it.. i was ok with this truck cuz i really liked the cement gray and the truck was really nice.. i really felt like i got f____ed on this deal big time!! No custermer service at all!! Only from Paul!! He was only one trying to help us!! All i wanted was to work out a deal better than what we got.. i understand its a money thing and i get it! But weres the custeremer service!? I am a huge car enthusiast and changing cars quite a bit.. i know you loose money on this but to loose all this money now im paying almost 90 grand on a 45 grand truck?!!!! This was a no loose money deal with this truck purchase..!! It just went to greedy! Elijah said my m3 is not worth much but now i see it listed at 39 grand! .. i wanted to try toyota because of the pro series line.. i love the truck.. i was always getting german cars and never had a problem with custermer service.. me and my brother is in the tow industry.. we tow cars and recommend people all day long.. we and i will never recommend dch oxnard ever again!! Horrible and a rip off!! I will never buy a toyota ever again!! Its a joke..!!! I felt like ur management team was only trying to screw us because they knew we wanted the truck..all this could have bin resolved in a different way and everyone would have made money and i would have bin happy.. i am happy with the truck but furious with the deal!! I feel like a dumb idiot for paying that much for a truck thats not even that much!!! No one helped except Paul! Is there any way we can solve this? Right now i am so mad i will defiantly fill out the css survey and rate negative all across the line!! I will contact the state attorney general and the better business bureau. I dnt want to go that route if we can solve the issue.. 90 grand for a trd pro tacoma?

Christian Soza provided excellent customer service.  Gabs Tamsing did a expert job with the paperwork.  They were as nice as can be.  They were efficient - the whole deal took just a couple hours.

44,"February 07, 2017","I walked in to Oxnard Toyota to get some updates on the 2017 86 I was interested in leasing, only to be pulled into the office of Mr. Lee Jaitt and was being treated in a completely disrespectful way. Here are some key points of my experience:

1) Acquisition fee with Toyota is $650. It's the same with about 12 other dealers I called. Mr. Lee Jaitt insisted that the fee was $900 even after I told him I have a quote from another rep in his own dealer showing $650. 
2) I was looking for a basic 86 with no addons, halo color with the 6 speed manual transmission, and the MSRP is around $27k anywhere I called in the last 2 weeks. Instead of assisting me in finding exactly what I was looking for, Mr. Jaitt tried to shove a fully loaded 86 over $30k MSRP with all the optional TRD parts installed down my throat. 
3) He then tried to school me on MSRP vs dealer invoice price. 

I wouldn't say that I am a seasoned car buyer but I have leased 3 vehicles in the last 2 years, all with Toyota/Lexus, and have no plan to get any other brand. It's very unfortunate that Oxnard Toyota is only 1 block away from my company but they will not have my future business.

I had been researching Siennas through the COSTCO Auto program and had previously contacted Dan Rolag, the COSTCO Auto Program Contact. While at the dealership I met Johnny Mikhail. Now I have had some horrific experiences in the past with car salesmen so needless to say, I was apprehensive. In a matter of minutes, Johnny put me at ease. Johnny thoroughly demonstrated all the features on the Sienna and arranged for us to test drive it. Johnny was very knowledgable, professional and personable. What impacted me the most was how genuine he was. I knew I could trust him to honor his word. Johnny went out of his way to help me resolve some transportation issues. He even gave me his personal cell phone if I had any questions or ever needed a ride to work from Service. I have never met a salesperson I would recommend till Johnny. If you are ever in the market for a Toyota, go to DCH Toyota of Oxnard and ask for Johnny Mikhail. I guarantee you will have the best service experience ever!

Over all a bad experience with the sales department. I set up an appointment with the sales department to look at a car. I got an email confirmation about the car with the specs of the vehicle. We drove up  2 hours to the dealership because he said that everything was ready to go. We were almost to the dealership (10 minutes away) when we received a text message, not a phone call, telling us that the truck wasn't even at the dealership. I was told the truck wasn't even for sale. My wife and I then turned around and drove back home.  When we arrived to our house, 2 hours away, the salesman called us to tell us he had another truck available. He gave us information that sounded like a great deal so we proceeded to make the trip again. When we arrived to the dealership we were told something different from what the salesman had told us. He didn't clarify certain things over the phone since he was trying to get us to the dealership again. To make this long story short, the salesman had to get his supervisor and then he disappeared. We spoke to his manager and when we were leaving, the salesman magically appeared as we were walking out. They didn't seem genuinely apologetic over us driving down there twice!",1.0

I will be honest and tell you  why I'm giving you only 3 stars

* the first star is to Edgar Cordova salesman . when I spoke to him over the phone, I told him the I was tired and did not want to spend hours and hours waiting for a lame offer. he then said to me. Elisa I would have number for you in 45 minutes..... well he did. then when I negotiate w/ them they did give me the payments I was looking for.

*the second. star is because after I shop around and was tired they did give me the best APR. me and my son have bad credit so it was nice to see a low apr.. 

*3rd star is because you took my car the I still own $7200. and give me $4000.00 that make me happy. to me it was fair and nice of you.

now the reason you did not get 5 stars is.

1. I did not like the way Edgar took  the paper work when I told him I was going to think about it over night. feel rude,  and did not like the aggressive way. you talk to me when I told you to do a discount. I did not like it at all. 
* i did not like the car was on empty on the gas when I stay there till 9pm. most dealers have there car w/ gas or give the costumer a voucher.. 

2. I did not like the way your  financial Manager talk to me, Mr. Santander when I ask you what the $399.00 was for? you keep telling me the it was in the price the Edgar give me.. when I talk to Edgar he toll me all was going to be explain by you.
you never toll me it  was for and extra warranty the is optional to buy... you avoid my question. I did not like that.  you need  to be honest and answer your costumers questions and concerns. 
also did not like the way you make it sound the my car service was going to be free when in reality I'm paying $760.00 for it. I did notice it,  but I took it  because at the end,  is a good deal. 

now I have post on Yelp like you guys ask me. but I will also talk to my co-workers when they ask me where did I buy my car ( really nice car by the way)  I will  let them know  what my experience was . ( is only 1500 employees)

144,"May 03, 2013","DCH Toyota of Oxnard was one of the best dealerships my husband and I have had the pleasure of experiencing. One of the best things about the dealership was our sales person, Edgar. He was sincere, understanding and very patient with us as we chose the next addition to our family. We spent a total of 6 hours at the dealership from start to finish, and never once did Edgar show any signs of frustration or fatigue. He completely went above and beyond the call of duty; he offered his honest opinions on color and specifications and even gave his own life stories to better support his opinions. My husband and I were only browsing when we came to DCH, thus, we left all the necessary paperwork at home. This was no match for Edgar and DCH - Edgar drove us through traffic, over 60 miles, to obtain the necessary documents, and never once let his smile leave his face. Not only was Edgar attentive to us, but the entire DCH team treated us like humans - not paychecks - and every team member we met was warm and welcoming. I understand as a dealership, you want to make a sale - but with DCH, and especially with Edgar, this was not the case. The entire sales team went above and beyond to find EXACTLY what I wanted (as the car I wanted was not available in their lot) and delivered above expectations. The sales manager, Debra, was sweet and very truthful; she did not advertise options that she herself would not want because she knew it would waste our time. The whole experience was, without a doubt, effortless and exciting. The team made us feel like we were part of their family, and the facility was beautiful and clean - it made me feel like the dealership really cared about their clients, not only with their cars, but with the entire experience. 

I cannot recommend DCH of Oxnard enough; apparently, my parents also purchased their most recent vehicle from DCH of Oxnard as well. It seems that good taste in cars and dealership runs in the family. I highly recommend DCH Toyota of Oxnard and will definitely keep them in mind when it is time to purchase another family car.

But Lee gave us a very high trade-in value, and managed to reduce the monthly payment to a point where it made sense.  We've been extremely happy with the Camry since then.  It's wonderful having a car with lots of modern features such as an electronic key and built-in bluetooth and dual temperature control.  The car is amazingly quiet, the acceleration is fantastic, and the gas mileage is of course exceptional.  It makes me wonder how we put up with the Mirage for as long as we did.

The most recent, I relieved myself of on Monday with the personal yet professional help of Ron Parks at DCH Toyota of Oxnard.

We told Claudio what we were looking for, he pointed us to a few items, then when we mentioned we were looking for a specific used vehicle, he said, ""Why, we just took one of those in trade today!"" and then proceeded to make the purchase happen. He was honest and straightforward, and a pleasure to deal with. There was no pressure or a sense of urgency to get the deal bought - he knew that we wanted that vehicle and wanted to make it happen for us. Elijah was also a pleasure to work with. He went over the options and insurance information in a very thorough yet business-like manner. I am absolutely thrilled that I got the exact car I wanted with a minimum of hassle. This was probably the easiest car purchasing experience I've ever been through. Thanks, guys!",5.0

I was unhappy with a previous deal I made with DCH Toyota and yes I am very much at fault but being at fault doesn't excuse the dealership for taking advantage. Before this gets off on the wrong foot let me explain what happened to change my mind. I recieved a promotion from a nearby dealership Hyundai who said they would take my trade in blah blah. When I got there they said no way your upside down on that vehicle and would need at least 3k down. Then their finance manager suggested that I go to Toyota and have them return all the extra insurances and warranties that way I wouldn't be so upside down and it would cost me less to do a trade in. So taking that advice I went to DCH Toyota and I happened to talk to the finance manager and simply asked if he could remove my warranties and insurances to bring down the over all loan. He was puzzled why i would do this so I explained. Then he said wait this is not how we want a returning customer to feel so he had Paul Panz Specialist take me out to look at a 2012 Scion and I loved it then the finance manager worked with me on how to come up with the financing I can afford and how to get a loan even though my credit had taking a bit of a hit from the last time I was in. I have to say this was above and beyond my expectations. Thank you! ,5.0
244,"June 08, 2012","Ron Parks made sure that I got exactly what I was looking for, down to the color and additional Package. He's a hard charger and do what it takes to ensure you walk out with a smile on your face. He was very honest and up front with me and made sure that I was comfortable with what I was buying and the price. Not once did he apply any pressure (Like the Yo-hos over on Johnson do). I'd definately recommend him to family and friends looking for a New or Used Vehicle as go back to him peraonally if I ever had the need for another vehicle. IMO, I don't think DCH truly knows thaty have a shining star her. Now they do. DCH as a whole has treated me fair and square. I bought a Honda CRV fom DCH Honda a few years ago and was impressed with them as well. That was my main reason for going to DCH Toyota.",5.0

After visiting a bunch of other local dealer ships and even some in L.A. and Pasadena I stopped by DCH Toyota on a whim just to check out their used vehicle selection.  Ron was very helpful and informative.  No pressure sales.  I got a great deal on my truck and am very happy with it.  

In all honesty I do have to admit being little disappointed that the truck was given to me with the fuel tank completely empty (not even enought to get home!) and needed an oil change - but other than that everything is in great condition.

259,"April 05, 2012","For over a month I conducted research on a specific vehicle that my wife and I were looking to purchase. I spoke with several local dealerships and got the typical, aggressive salesman approach...... Headache! Then, I saw a vehicle fitting our needs at DCH in Oxnard. My initial instinct was that it was too far from our home, but the price seemed reasonable in comparison to other identical vehicles. After calling in with an inquiry on the vehicle, the Sales Manager; Matt, connected me with Al Gaines..... What a blessing in disguise! Within two minutes I realized that he was a no-nonsense and knowledgeable guy. He answered all of my questions right away and was VERY personable. We left the phone call with him putting zero pressure on me. He offered his assistance and left me his numbers in case I had further questions. Four days later we drove 2.5 hours to see the car in person and it was exactly what Al promised. Within twenty minutes we had finalized the purchase of our new vehicle and the trade-in of our old one. Just as important, Al made a recommendation for a place nearby  to eat lunch, which was also excellent! At the end of the day my wife and I felt extremely comfortable with Al - as if we had known him for years. They may call him Al ""Capital"" Gaines, but it should be Al ""The Man"" Gaines! And, the DCH Toyota dealership is a huge facility that was well maintained. Coffee, delicious cookies and an overall kind staff!  Thanks DCH and Al!!! We couldn't have asked for a more pleasant experience!

304,"February 07, 2012","I bought a new (2010 model) Toyota Prius from Al Gaines at the DCH Toyota of Oxnard in February of 2011.  It was the third Toyota dealership I went to (also Van Nuys and Escondido) and I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised by my experience at this dealership.

To give you a little background, I'm a little ""frugal"" and this was my first new car.  I guess a lot of people like the experience of shopping and like to see what is out there.  For me, I knew exactly what I wanted going into the dealership and don't like the feeling of being pressured or ""sold"" on something else.  I just want somebody to give me the best deal on what I want.

When I spoke to Al Gaines I felt like he understood where I was coming from and willing to work with me.  He laid out my options with different level trims of the Prius and helped me evaluate what the price difference looked like on a monthly basis.  And at the time Toyota was offering a special of 0.9% financing or cash back.  Al helped me run the numbers and figure out which one would be my cheapest option.  In the end I ended up choosing the base model Prius (which I still am very happy with) and Al never made me feel like I was being cheap, or pressured me to upgrade, or make a funny face, or anything.

So all in all, I would say that I was very pleasantly surprised with the level of service and would highly recommend Al Gaines and DCH Toyota of Oxnard to anybody looking for a new (or new to them) car, truck, or SUV.

Hope you find this information helpful and good luck with your car search.

Purchasing a new vehicle can be a very stressful process, however, I can honestly say (much to my relief) that from the time I pulled into the DCH  Toyota  Oxnard lot I was treated with respect and no ""pushy"" sales approach. I had studied the Internet and had a fair idea of what I was looking for.  Salesman,  Thomas Guzzo,  was awesome!  He was polite, informative and listened to (and heard) what kind of car I was looking for.  Best of all, there was no haggling.  I got a great car at a terrific price.  Thank you, Thomas, for making what could have been an  unpleasant experience  become an exciting one!

I found the perfect Toyota which, by the way,  is my 4th.  In my opinion, the craftsmanship and reliability of Toyota and the service of DCH Toyota of Oxnard can't be beat.  This is what car salesmanship is all about!

Making a trip into DCH Toyota of Oxnard was a great experience. I wanted to look at the selection to compare to the other cars (jetta, civic, mazda etc) I have been looking at. I was met with Richard, a salesman at DCH Toyota of Oxnard. I am a first time buyer and it was helpful to have Richard help me. I met with the sales manager of DCH Toyota of Oxnard, named Oscar. I felt like a valuable customer with help from these two guys. I drove a saturn before (engine problems) and wanted to switch to a reliable car company. I looked everywhere for the best deals on practical cars. I decided that the Toyota Prius would be the best car for me. I was able to afford a Prius on my budget. It has been one of the greatest decisions ever! I drive a lot which is one of the reason I got the Prius (up to 50 miles per gallon! or 600 miles a tank!)

In dealing with Thomas Guzzo there was no BS sales pitch, he was honest, respectful, professional, and knew about the product he was showing me. I was very pleased that when we sat down at the table and were working out a deal, there was no over the top pressure from him or the Sales Managers. Thomas Guzzo did a great job walking me through the different options and explaining everything I had questions on. Once we agreed on everything I sat down with Elijah Williams, who was very respectful and professional. Elijah Williams walked through all the paperwork with me, ensuring I understood everything.

WHAT A BREATH OF FRESH AIR!!!!!  

This is what I posted on the main Toyota Facebook page:

Ok, so I FINALLY did it!  I found a reputable Toyota dealer!!!!!!  I NEVER thought it possible, but Toyota/Scion of OXNARD is the BEST!!!!
They replaced my radio, safety checked my car, fixed a nail in the tire, put a new battery in my key AND washed the damn thing, all for a whopping $13.22!!!  When I told Joshua Del La O about ALL THE OTHER CRAPPY DEALERS in the area, that gave me the runaround and wanted to charge me $100, all he did was laugh and say:  ""HA! We don't roll like that!"" 
How can dealers be SO DIFFERENT???  WHY don't they ALL want happy customers like Oxnard???  
Joshua is the BEST!  *And if you wanna BUY a car, hit up Chris H.

372,"May 10, 2011","It was a pleasure working with James Gray in our efforts to buy a new car at DCH Toyota/Scion of Oxnard.
All through the acquisition process he was prompt, helpful and honest in his dealings with us. We have never had such an easy time buying a new car. He located the desired Corolla LE on line for us in just one day and streamlined the actual purchase at the dealership to about an hour. He handled all of the details for us, including even working directly with our agent to seamlessly transfer the insurance coverage from our previous car to the new one.
He also took us on a trial ride in our new car and in very clear terminology, explained all of the operational and maintenance details en route, before washing the whole car, filling it up with gas and sending two very satisfied customers home with the exact car they started out to find and the price they wanted to get it for.
I can recommend James Gray to anyone desiring to purchase a Toyota with the minimal fuss possible.

I told her why I was there and that I would need a shuttle back to work.  I was in a shuttle and on my way in under ten minutes.  When I came back that afternoon to pick up my truck I was told there was a leak around where the timing chain is.  I would need to bring my truck back in a couple weeks to check it out.  Not so happy about that, but sounded like a safety issue and so of course came back at the appointed time.  This time, Cynthia not only met me at my truck as I pulled in, but called me by name as well.  I was given a rental car, the fix was under warranty and three days later I returned to a working truck.  Cynthia was extremely knowledgeable in her description of what was wrong with my truck from beginning to end.  She always wore a smile and is the epitome of customer service.

When we got there and met Al it was quite a new experience for me. I had never been treated with the dignity that I received from him. He made us feel like we were talking with a friend although very professional. He worked with my daughter and came up with a price with full coverage that would be comfortable with payments that she could afford. At no time did we feel like we were at a car dealership dealing with shrewed salesmen who only cared about what they could make on the deal. In fact I don't believe he made enough from the sale to make his time worthwhile. I will go on face book and whatever I have to do to let everyone know about the service we received from you. My hat is off to you and I salute you for the quality of character in Al Gaines. You have a great salesman doing great work for you, Also Randall Holt Service and parts manager who gave us a hat and water container for my daughter and I. You would have thought we were buying the most expensive car there instead of a used one. Also Matt Dimmitt and especially his wife who engaged us in a great conversation and added a much needed insurance at an affordable price. They all made us feel comfortable and relaxed in the hands of professionals that cared about us and treated us with dignity and respect. Thank you all for a wonderful experience. I am still amazed.

394,"January 10, 2011","I would highly recommend Jim Gray for the reasons that first off, he was very cordial upon our meeting.  He was knowledgable about the Prius, of which I was interested.  He searched other dealers for the particular car in which I was interested, but could not find anything within the 100 mile radius.  He offered to show me what he had in stock, and soon I was convinced of one of the choices he had given me.  Jim was always very helpful and informative.  He worked on my behalf to make the best deal, including the change out of tires to the Michelin brand.  As we accepted the vehicle, Jim spent as much time as we needed to become acquainted with the car.  I am a previous Prius owner, having traded in my 2007 for the new one, so had some knowledge of the Prius.  I can, without reservation, recommend Jim Gray as an outstanding salesperson for your company.

399,"December 23, 2010","After researching Toyota Tundra's for a year, it was finally time to purchase one. Being deployed in Afghanistan, it makes it hard to do this via email, but I decided to give it a shot.

When we first visited DCH Oxnard in June, we met with a sales person who was great. He took the time, talked with us before test driving a truck. When we were done with the drive, he went over every square inch of that truck, showing us features and safety items. It was nice to have that kind of personal service shown to us, even with him knowing we were not going to purchase that day, but not for a few months.  Our original sales person was no longer there, but Jim Gray was and he was a blessing!

Jim Gray answered my email, and with his rapid responses, it was refreshing to see someone take the time to answer my questions. He sent me prices, quotes, pictures on 2011 Tundra's, both SR5 and SR5 TRD, and was excellent to deal with. 

When it came down to chooseing the one I wanted, Jim took the time to email me all the specs. Before I could even ask about what prices they would accept for this one I choose, Jim had sent me a price quote, which I didn't even need to counter with! Tremendous savings!!!

Next it was off to finance for my wife to do this on her own. Before she got there, Jim had already researched and found additional rebates that were more that we thought! Then to top it off, DCH Oxnard actually got us the 0% financing! What a holiday treat!!  Sending my wife to do the finance without me being able to be there was nervewracking, but wouldn't you know it, Jim had already taken care of it all. Whey my wife got there, the Finance dept was ready for her, and did not pressure her in to buying additional items. They respected her and treated her fairly. Additionally, she dropped her 2010 FJ off at the service department and they actually stayed late to do an oil change while she was completing the sale!! What great customer service by the service dept!

There is one work which encompasses DCH Oxnard, VALUES.  Not just the blatent monetary value of the great price of the truck, great financing, awesome rebates. That just was the best. But more important, personal values. Treating people with honesty, respect, and just plain friendly.  

I am looking forward to finally seeing in person and driving my new 2011 Tundra SR5 TRD, and meeting Jim and the rest of the staff. ",5.0

The Parts Dept. ordered the part and let me know that it would be a few days before it arrived.  The next morning on 10/21/10, I received a call from Toyota of Oxnard letting me know that the part had arrived.  I was unable to fit in a visit to Toyota on 10/21/10, but on the morning of 10/22/10 I called Bob and asked if I could drop in and have the part installed.  Bob said to come on over.

When I arrived, Bob immediately greeted me and said he would be with me in a minute.  A few minutes later, Bob had checked out my car and said he could get someone to install the part in a few minutes.  I thought I would have to take a shuttle home and wait and then come back in a few hours.

Within an hour, the part was installed and my car was washed.

Bob was resourceful to get the attention of a technician and have him install the part quickly.

I DO appreciate the great service and mindfulness of my time at Toyota of Oxnard.

My local dealership is DCH Toyota of Oxnard. Their staff was so friendly and helpful. The rep that helped me (Ricky) answered all my questions and took extra time to explain everything going on. He even took me to the garage while they were working on my car so I could get a first hand look at the work they were doing. I was even able to ask the mechanic questions.

Since then, Bob Cobos has been our almost exclusive Service Consultant (exceptions being his vacations, or having time off, etc., on those few occassions when I needed the vehicle serviced at the time of his absence).  I am pleased to say Mr. Cobos is an exemplary representative of Toyota of Oxnard.  His attention to detail, his way of making a customer feel welcome, his maner of dispelling concern about the mechanical problems the owner's vehicle is experiencing, and his assuring concern that the problem(s)will be expertly corrected, has allowed me to have the confidence that when Bob is my Consultant, the job will be done right.

I would also add that because of what I just described, Mr. Cobos surely just have the respect of his fellow employees; more specifically, the mechanics that do the repairs.  They have to know, because of Mr. Cobos, quality work is the only acceptable kind of work they must perform.

Mr. Cobos has made is possible for me to drive my Land Cruiser knowing I won't have repeat problems, or have to return the vehicle for fixing faulty repairs.  My thanks to Mr. Cobos, and to Toyota of Oxnard for having him represent them.

449,"September 15, 2010","I had a recent experience with your team at DCH Toyota of Oxnard and I want to share that with you.  First of all, I want to thank you, Chris Case and the team for renewing my belief in the Toyota brand, vehicles and service.  

Earlier this year I had a problem with my 2007 Toyota Tundra CrewMax that caused a loss of speed and acceleration as a result of a failed emission component and resulting notification system response.  I drive over 100 miles a day for work on the LA freeways and this rendered my truck useless to me.  After visiting DCH Toyota of Oxnard, I was initially told that the repair would cost $1200 (or more).  

After receiving that news, I began researching the problem on the web.  I read story after story of disappointing support from the Toyota Dealerships on what was clearly an emissions related defect.  I began to get a sinking feeling in my gut that I might have made a mistake on my recent purchase of the Toyota truck.  With all of the media about the recalls and faulty workmanship, I began to question my lifelong commitment to the Toyota brand.

I had recently switched my service to DCH of Oxnard after a long term declining customer service experience at Toyota of Ventura and other dealers that I tried.  I decided on DCH because I felt the service was more professional and efficient than I had experienced at the other locations.  After I contacted you about my problem, Chris responded to me and was able to work out the repairs as a warranty and good will gesture from DCH Toyota of Oxnard.

I have been a proud owner of Toyota vehicles since I first got my license in 1986 and have owned many Toyota vehicles since then.  After the care and service that I received from your team, my longstanding confidence in the Toyota name has been renewed as I have confidence that Toyota will stand behind its product and do the right thing for their customers.  I rely heavily on my vehicles and will continue buying, servicing and recommending Toyota and this Dealership as a result of this great experience.  

I appreciate the service that Chris Case and the DCH Toyota of Oxnard team has provided me.  I am once again a “loud and proud” owner of a Toyota vehicle and will continue to spread the word about your great product and service.

Dan walked me through the details of the car, a complete orientation, introduced me to the service department, never pushed a hard sell on extras.  Just as great, the Business Office completed the process of payment without ramming a bunch of extras at me, a completely and wholly unexpected pleasure.  The ""extras"" were fully offered and explained, but not pushed.  The purchase process was fast without being rushed.  Dan has followed up with email and a call post-sale to make sure of my satisfaction.  Lastly, I also executed a trade-in as part of the purchase.

Their response was quick and exactly what I wanted, an unpressured purchasing experience. The salesman that helped me was James Perez and I seriously recommend hunting him down at the dealership because he treated me unlike any other salesman from other dealerships I went to in this whole process. I don't want to name names but at the Toyota of Northridge I was inches from purchasing a car before I walked out because I checked the same car they had in the lot online and it was $1,500 cheaper when it was listed on autotrader.com then what they would sell it to me for. 

If you want a car purchasing experience where you are treated with respect and don't feel like you have to take a shower to wash the slime away from some sleezy salesman then you should go to DCH Toyota of Oxnard. 

*** Their Finance people were great too!

Because of the conversation, we went into the dealership knowing what we wanted and with a quoted price and knowing what our monthly payments would be.  Matt then turned us over to Jim Perez who was super friendly and it was clear that the customer was very important to the dealership.

This month (October '09), I took my car in to have the brakes checked out. They were soft and spongey feeling. As it turned out my car needed master cylinder, booster, strut, and the caliber braket worked on and/or replaced. Sean in the service department totally stepped up to bat for me assuring me that the master cylinder and booster issues would be covered under my extended warranty and Chris the service manager went to bat for me in regards to my bracket and strut problem. Both Sean and Chris were very proactive in making sure my car needs were addressed and covered by the Toyota extended warranty program. George, who is a mechanic, got on the phone with me to explain in simple terms what they were doing mechanically to my car so I would have a better understanding.

482,"August 14, 2009","My husband and I felt compelled to send a letter to the management team and owners of DCH Toyota regarding Paul Renteria. Paul is certainly the most customer oriented, professional sales professional we have ever dealt with. He exceeds any expectactions we had of our car buying experience. From the first meeting we had with Paul he was very relaxed and welcoming. Treated us as though we were his number one priority and he was very intuned with our needs. In fact originally my husband had his eye on a Corolla S but unfortunately there were no more Corolla S model vehicles left for sale, the last one had sold the night before! Paul quickly turned my husband's disappointment into interest as he described the options and availability of the Corolla XLE. He took us for a test drive and fielded all of our questions, which were many! In the end it turned out that my husband and I were happier with the Corolla XLE so we appreciated that Paul went the extra mile to show us the XLE even though that isn't what we originally were shopping for!
When it came to the financing portion of the deal we already had a loan approval from our credit union but Paul mentioned that perhaps the dealership could offer us a more attractive rate based on our credit evaluation. So he escorted us to Dan in the finance department to continue the contract process. Dan was able to offer us a better rate for financing and also sold us the additional options that we were interested in purchasing. The experience was very pleasant and was not a lengthy and laborious event.
We also noticed while we were at the dealership that all the employees we ran into were very polite, asked us if we needed assistance or were looking for someone and a number of individuals also offered us drinks and cookies. In short it was a very relaxed, inviting environment which was a very nice change to the usual tense feeling that one experiences at a dealership! 
However the thing that really impressed my husband and I was something Paul did in the end that was very unexpected. I can't drive because I am healing from a shattered ankle and am on crutches. We were trading in our 'Clunker' and needed to leave the vehicle with the dealer and wouldn't be picking up our new vehicle for a few days as it was going to the service center for PermaPlate treatment.....Paul offered to drive us home to Camarillo and to pick my husband up on the day that the car was ready to be delivered! We were very impressed that he would go out of his way to do this for us. He had already done so much to assist us, get us a great deal on our new vehicle, great financing and now a ride! Wow, we were ever so greatful. 
We have already recommended the dealership to 2 family members and when our daughter takes up driving in a year and a half we will be back to purchase another vehicle as she will inherit the Corolla XLE that we just purchased It is a perfect, safe, economical vehicle for her to start off with!
Our many thanks to YOU Paul.....you are the best and we hope someone 'important' is taking note of the fact that you are making 'The Difference' everyday! ",5.0

490,"July 11, 2009","A quick note to let you know how much we appreciate the salesman Paul Renteria. Briefly, I found Paul while searching the Internet for my wife’s new car. Calling the phone number on your web site, Paul answered and at the get-go was courteous, professional, and refreshingly direct. We had just literally walked out on a deal from Santa Barbara Toyota for the very same car. We had the paperwork, and checkbook in hand at SB Toyota and they offended us in every way. After that, we were willing to take the 45 minute drive through traffic to avoid working with the Santa Barbara sales team. Boy are we glad we did. 
You need to know, that Paul was nut pushy, extremely knowledgeable, presented a “Can-Do” attitude, and gave us a very fair price without all of the sales-speak and usual time wasting “…well he’s not gonna like this, but I gotta talk to my manager…” and making us wait for 15 minutes each go-round. Paul made the usually uncomfortable, stress-filled car buying experience easy. He was quick and efficient. He is our new best friend.

In closing, we like him so much, we decided to buy a second new car from Paul. As soon as the 2010 Prius solar package IV Blizzard white, bisque leather is in, I will come down to seal the deal on that one too. 

As a business owner myself, I like to reward the good employees. From my point of view, Paul Renteria is one of your best!
