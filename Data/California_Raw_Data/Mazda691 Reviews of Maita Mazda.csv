I worked with Ricky who was very friendly and knowledgeable.  They did an oil change, a recall, and replaced the battery on my Key.  It was fast, and although they made recommendations, for additional services they did not pressure me to do any like I have experienced other places.  I will be back they did a great job.",5.0
1,"May 09, 2020","We had a fantastic buying experience. We love our new CX-5 signature. Thank you Sherri Wilkerson and Scott behind the desk. Your professionalism was extraordinary. They buying process was enjoyable and no pressure. Thank you Sherri for all your time explaining the high tech features of my wife’s new car.  The safety features and technology that are standard on this CX-5, are usually on much more expensive cars.   

Well done ! 
Will be recommending you to friends and family.

2,"May 08, 2020","Process was smooth even with COVID-19. Appreciated Solvi's patience while I was finding the best deal. The trade-in value offered for my previous Subaru was a little disappointing as it was 1/3 of what I was able to sell it for privately but I supposed that is to be expected.

3,"March 23, 2020","I worked with Bert Johnson. Very good customer service. He found the car I wanted. When I was ready to purchase I walked in took a test drive and purchased the car. Everyone was great. The finance person was a fast talker to get everything in a short amount of time. But took the time to go back and explain everything slower for me.
The followup is fantastic. ",5.0
4,"March 14, 2020","Buying my outback at Maita was the best car buying experience I have ever had. Very professional, friendly and really listened to my needs. I never felt like anyone was trying to up sale or change my mind on what I wanted. ",5.0

6,"March 08, 2020","We purchased our new Crosstrek from Maita.  From the time we contacted Larry Bilger on the phone, to actually going to the dealership, to purchase our car, it had to be one of the easiest and pleasant experiences we have had purchasing a vehicle.  Larry is an  exceptional salesperson.  He is very personable, and knowledgeable.  He returned phone calls, and there were no surprises when we met him at the dealership.  ",5.0

8,"February 16, 2020","I love my car and believe I got a fair deal. However, my fault for not paying attention during test drive, it needed service. The air filter needed to be replaced, it needed an oil change, both key fobs were low on batteries. Plus updates on SOS and navigation. So $400 later I still love my car but I think these should have been taken care of. Then, finance went through without discussing interest rates with me, I’ll likely refinance myself.",3.4
9,"January 18, 2020",Our experience at Maita was incredible. Daniel Espero was not only personable but professional and when we purchased the car spent great time showing us all it’s features. ,5.0
10,"January 15, 2020","This was the 1st time I've ever bought a Mazda and it will be the last. Maita Mazda on Auburn Blvd in Sacramento is the worst. DO NOT bring your car there. Paul, one of the salesman overcharged me 3 times, then had to go back once I explained the details. I brought it in for an initial problem with the engine. I bought the extended warranty, everything should have been covered. He tried to charge me for that. Once the major work had been completed I got my car back, but the navigation didn't work and there was a rattling under my dashboard. I had to bring the car back into the shop a week later to get those fixed. He tried to charge me $140 to diagnose the issue. When I explained to him there shouldn't be a charge because it was their fault, he looked through his notes and took off the charge. (No apology). They did not give me a loaner car even though both issues were their fault. I paid $40 for UBER to get me back to the dealership. They said the navigation still couldn't be fixed because their main guy was out. I brought it in a few weeks later (7am appointment). Paul once again tried to charge me to diagnose the issue. The guy called in sick, so I had to reschedule again! I had to make another appointment, which Paul said he would call me. A month later I had to call because Paul never called. I spoke to another person and made an immediate appointment. I spoke with another salesman who said they would look into the issue. After waiting 30 minutes, Paul came over and said they don't know what's wrong and they need to call Mazda. He wanted to charge me another $145 for diagnostics and said it would take at least 4-5 hours to figure out the issue. I told him to go xxxx off and give me my car back. I wouldn't give them a dime because he tried to charge me 4 different times and never got back to me about anything. This entire process lasted over 6 months. FIRE Paul! DO NOT bring your car to Maita Mazda in Sac, Auburn Blvd.  ",1.0
11,"January 14, 2020","I love my Ascent (my first Subaru). Taylor Hills knows his job. He knows the car. He showed us all features of the car and it’s functions. That guy is awesome. If I had to buy a car again, I know exactly where and whom I had to go to. Thanks Maita Subaru!",5.0
12,"January 07, 2020","I started my journey looking at various makes & models, loving them an soon finding something else that captured my attention .. But then came the Mazda CX-5, and I was hooked! I watched the YouTube videos for months, and finally went and just sat in one, but I didn't take it out for a ride, cause I wasn't ready to purchase one just yet. But now it's January 2020, the time was right, but which one to chose...! The problem arose when I saw the CX-30! Awwwwh! I test drove it,and almost purchased it instead... I had to pray on it.... The next day I knew... CX-5 was my choice☺️.. Let me tell you, everything went smoothly, Kelly, Ira, and Sherri all worked together to make my purchase of a 2019 Mazda CX-5 a blessing.. I only been driving it a few days, and my wife and I have been very pleased, .. I thank Jesus for sending me there, and placing these fine people before me to help me in gettin this vehicle ... Maita Mazda, THANK YOU,.... & Shalom",5.0

18,"October 27, 2019","This should be Maita Subaru not Maita Mazda!

Great experience. Got the car I wanted at a great price after shopping around for six weeks. Sergei Samolik and Larry Bilger helped me. Sergei sold me the car and he was great. All around I am so happy with the car. I have owned only Subaru’s since I was 19, and this is my first cat in 17 yrs. party!! ",5.0

If you’re looking for a great sales person, ask for Kelly. I appreciated all the help, guidance, and time spent during my decision making and purchase. ",5.0
25,"September 20, 2019","We had an Awesome experience with Maita Subaru. To be honest our search for a new vehicle was really easy. My last Subaru, a B9 Tribeca lasted for 235,000 miles. I had that vehicle serviced as Maita Subaru and have had the Pleasure of working with Ben Lee as my service manager. He has been awesome. So we knew we were going to by a Subaru, and we knew we were buying from Maita. We had a wonderful experience working with Randy Wurschmidt as our sales person. He took his time with us and allowed us to see lots of different vehicles in the inventory and we drove them all. He was knowledgeable and patient with us, and a real pleasure to work with. I would recommend this dealership to anyone.

27,"September 04, 2019",iRa and Kelly help us find the car of our dreams. My wife picked the red with a tan leather interior. They brought it from another dealership. When it was discovered that a ding and scratches needed to be fixed they took care of it and made us a fair deal. They know how to take care of the customer,4.8
28,"September 01, 2019",Not since 1992 Saturn that I had a no haggle experience.  Maita and Randy went the extra mile to get me the best deal and service. Randy stayed with me until it was done including the insurance on a late Saturday evening. ,5.0
29,"August 30, 2019","I look really young. Visited several other places in past and get treated like a kid just wanting to drive some new cars.

30,"August 25, 2019",Ben was a great to work with and was very accommodating of our needs. He was with us every step of the way. Finance went super quick and we got a good deal on what we wanted. We would definitely buy from Ben and Maida Subaru again.,5.0
31,"August 21, 2019","Up front, honest and helpful. Bill our salesperson was the best! No BS and helped us to get the best deal possible on my Mazda6. Will shop the Maita “family” for cars in the future. 

Went to Mazda Elk Grove first and had the worst experience. Hesitant when I walked through Maita Mazda because of it. But Bill was great and very helpful. Made me feel like part of the family and worked with me to get the best price and banker interest rate for a loan. 

My husband and I agree...we will only shop at a Maita dealership in the future. Would HIGHLY recommend to anyone looking for a new or used car.  ",5.0
32,"August 02, 2019",The staff at the dealership are very good to deal with.  They are helpful without being pushy.  Tony Yang was the main person I dealt with though there were others whose names I do not recall.  Buying a new car is stressful enough but Maita reduces the stress considerably.  ,5.0
33,"July 26, 2019","My husband and I are extremely happy with the whole experience of purchasing a new car at Miata Mazda.  From the time we walked in the door to leaving with our new car, what a pleasant surprise.

Our salesperson Solvie Noonan, was great.  She was very knowledgeable about the car, and could answer all of our questions easily.  During the purchase process, the sales manager came out to greet us, as did the the contract person.  We didn’t have to wait long for Solvie, to come back with a very good offer.  Signing the contract and all of the paperwork again was easy and friendly.

The whole experience was really refreshing compared to other dealers we visited before buying at Maita.

Yesterday, we took the car back so Solvie could reexplain some of the features of the car, again we were very happy, she graciously  took us through everything we didn’t get the first time.  Lots of new technology for us.",5.0

39,"June 09, 2019","I would have loved to have in-dash nav system,, I found out too late it is not available on my new Outback Premium.. someone should have asked me what was important to me in a new car,,, before signing the paperwork!! My fault??? maybe?? am I expected to know what is available and what is not? Or should the sales staff go over the options with the buyer???
As far as courteous staff 5 stars! speed of the overall transaction 4 stars! Price of the vehicle without the normal haggling 5 Stars! Sales staff knowledge 3 stars!  ",4.3
40,"June 08, 2019","Sherry and other staff went out of their way to make a big decision and purchase as smooth, easy and fair as possible. We used the Costco discount and Sherry handled this readily and helped with other ways to give us a very fair price on exactly the car we want, especially with all the safety features we hoped for.  We have an appointment with Lea next week to make sure we can utilize our Outback’s special features.  We feel very well supported in getting the most out of a great car. ",5.0
41,"June 02, 2019",We purchased a used 2016 Mazda cx5  we found on the internet and traded our 2015 Mazda3.The dealer gave us a fair trade in price.The car had a small hole in the windscreen and it was agreed it would be repaired but when we picked the car up we were not happy with the repair so after discussions the windscreen was replaced with a factory one at a shop of our choice.We were very pleased with how the dealership dealt with the issue and are very pleased with our car!,5.0
42,"May 30, 2019","Had an excellent car buying experience with Maita Mazda. Best price, great Mazda representative, fast paperwork... but there was an issue with our new car and we were told it would be fixed and delivered in 2 or 3 days. After a week, it was delivered and the update they were supposed to make was done poorly, so we sent it back. After TWO WEEKS and two days, we finally got our new car. Definitely took the excitement/happiness out of the car buying process. (And no, they did not offer to compensate us for their shoddy work/2 week delay.) Started out so well but lacked in follow-through. It’s a shame. ",4.0

44,"May 08, 2019","I brought my Subaru Outback in for service and asked Jose for a test drive of a 2019 Subaru Ascent.  This would be our seventh new Subaru (majority were Outbacks) since 2001 if we had decided to purchase it.  For us there isn't another vehicle maker that offers the value, styling and reliability that Subaru offers so there is no point in driving anything else!!  None of our Subaru's has ever left us stranded!!  We bought the Ascent.  Maita made us the deal we were looking for and the new Ascent is our best Subaru yet!  It is beautiful inside and out and is very versatile and re-configurable.  The interior ergonomics are very well engineered.  It is very quiet and fun to drive with more than ample power and room.  Maita made it a pleasure to do business with them!",5.0
45,"May 05, 2019","While searching for the car I wanted, I came across their website and emailed about the availability.  They responded very quickly and without any pressure or sales pitch.  I reviewed them online to see how others felt and got such a good feeling about what others were saying.  I had to wait a week before coming into the dealership so I was hoping it was still there and it was!  Super nice staff, clean dealership - no problems at all.  Thank you so much for everything",5.0
46,"May 05, 2019","Knowing exactly which Mazda 3 my husband and I were interested in checking out, I called Sacramento Maita Mazda and asked to be directed to the sales MANAGER. Lo and behold I was immediately directed to Scott. He made arrangements for the red and white cars to be brought over, washed and ready for us to see the next day. From there Bill and Scott sealed a deal we were happy with and we were in and out of Maita with our brand new beautiful red 2019 Mazda 3 hatchback!",5.0

I have been incredibly happy with my new car. Thanks!,5.0
50,"April 13, 2019","My wife and I went in to see the 2018 Mazda 3. Ira Carter was our salesman. He's kinda pushy event though I made it clear that we want to see the number & might not buy on that day. Spending more than $20K on a car is a big purchase for me so I'm shopping around to get the best deal out there. He gave me a higher price than he quoted me previously on the email (it's $1,500 different). His reason was the previous quote was for hatchback. However, I confirmed the price is correct before I came to the dealership.  

We left the dealership and he contacted me for follow up the next day.  I did put my offer to him but he never responded back to me.  At least give me some response. That's how you treat the potential customer?? Where's the customer services?  ",1.2
51,"March 30, 2019","This dealershipsl’s online communication was better than any other dealerships I dealt with.  They know that what customers, who choose the shop online, are looking for— no nonsense, detailed, out the door pricing.  I traveled all the way from Bakersfield to purchase my car from Miata Mazda.  They made the process simple and direct, with no surprises. I got the best  deal on a new Mazda 6 from Miata Mazda!",5.0

54,"March 13, 2019","Overall, five stars. The best car buying (& selling old car) experience we ever had. 

Tony, our sales person was wonderful and we liked him as a sales person.  He was not pushy at all.  He was knowledgeable, friendly , and easy to talk to.  He made us feel very comfortable , which was very important to us. 

Kent, the deal making gentleman, was great.  He made the ""deal process"" so quick and great for us; this process takes so long and stressful at other dealerships, but Maita was so fast and least stressful that we could not believe it.

Eric, the finance guy was very friendly and professional.  He made us feel comfortable as well.

We have never purchased Subaru before (no family member has one either). We were planning to buy a different car from other dealership.  We stopped by since we drove nearby, and we are so glad we did!

We will definitely make Maita Subaru our first stop when we need another car.  
We love driving Outback :)  great car.
Thank you all very much!!

No haggle, no wheeler dealer.  We bought two cars, one for my 87 year old dad, one for me.  Bob Brant was fabulous on making sure we understood all the new technology on our cars.  He was thorough, patient, and welcomed all our questions.   We later could set up an apt to meet with  Lea Rosa to revisit all the technology on the car after we have driven it for awhile.

Nobody was pushy and everyone was very nice. Unfortunately I cannot remember the wonderful woman I worked with in the finance office however she was amazing as well.

Ira hooked my husband and I up with a deal that was so good other dealerships couldn't even try to compete with it. And I have full confidence that Mazda stands behind their cars with full confidence, Lifetime Warranty?!?! I still can't believe that is really a thing!but it is,cause I got it! I've  never been to a car dealership that is so transparent with their customers. This place is truly a diamond in the rough. we've bought a lot of cars in the past and I've never felt as good as I did with this car buying experience, I only wish I had found this place sooner!

70,"December 23, 2018","I’ve given up with this dealership it has been nothing but problems and very poor service. The people are nice but quality of work and customer is very poor. I brought my brand new Mazda in for the apple car play agreed to have my car washed while it was there. They took about 3.5 hours with my car. When I came back to pick up my car, they pulled it up and it was dirtier than when I left it. When I said something the service writer said sorry it was under a tree when your drive the dirt will blow off and ran back inside. When I got into my car it was filthy, there was no respect for my vehicle. I couldn’t stay and deal with the issue because of time constraint, however I called them on my way home only to be on hold by service department. I called back and just told the receptionist to have them call me when they are free. Once at home I went over to passenger side opened my door and my seat was never put back together the plastic pieces were just left on the side of it between the door. I also hate a chip of paint on the door handle. Even more furious I called back again and they were still too busy to discuss the issue. Instead I fixed the seat myself and I am having the chip in paint fix else where but I’m never going back to this dealership again.

2nd, when I bought my car last February, their was a scratch on hood, They said they couldn't fix it so to compensate, I would get free oil change.  Now I find out, when you buy a new car, it comes with two free oil changes so I was screwed over when I bought the car..

76,"December 18, 2018","We used the Consumer Report site for information about the cx-5 and also its internet purchasing  service.  Ira contacted us within a few hours after which we connected with him.  A very reasonable price was agreed upon which included incentives.  The following day we met with Joshua (Ira was busy with other responsibilities at the time) who began working with figures different from those agreed upon.  After further discussion it was discovered that a mistake had been made on the amount of the incentives. This was corrected by lowering the agreed price of the cx-5 so that the total price was the initial offer. 

Joshua was superb as a salesman. Shane was helpful in Finance. We have purchased many vehicles in the past and  are both certain that this was probably the most pleasant, stress-free purchases we have ever made.

94,"November 30, 2018","I brought in my Mazda 3 for a check engine light on a Saturday, and was told that they were closed Sunday so they would start work on Monday. “Fine”, I thought, thanking them and taking the complimentary lyft back to my apartment. “Couple days without the car, I’ll just bike places.”

From this, though, we spiral downward. Monday slides by without a single call, voicemail, email, or text message. I call after getting off work. “Oh didn’t you get my phone calls?” Nope, I didn’t. “Oh we’re having an IT issue.” 

This, I can only assume, means that the issue is they didn’t do IT (pun very much intended). But we press forward. “We did the diagnostic and it’s a recording issue, the technician said the test drive was fine so we’ll finish it tomorrow.” Oh, fantastic, price doesn’t seem out of hand, great I can pick it up tomorrow at 2.

Tuesday rolls around. No phone calls, no nothing. 2 comes and I call them. Again. A new rep picks up the phone. “Your rep isn’t in today, so we’re going to do the diagnostic today and it should be ready for pickup tomorrow.”

Excuse me what? I could’ve sworn we just did this. Now, slightly worrying I’m trapped in a Groundhog Day situation, I ask what he means. “Oh I don’t know, it’s not my file so I’m not sure what is being done on it.” I mean, sure, but how about we don’t tell the customer that we have no idea what’s going on.

“We’ll give you a courtesy car though.” Fine, whatever, I just want my car back. I go to pick up the car after I get off work, and meet rep 2. He begins sassing me for not having my insurance on me, since like a normal person I keep it in my car, especially when I don’t have a thought that I’m going to need to get a courtesy car. Huffing and puffing he helps me get the courtesy car.

Now we hit Thursday through Monday, where we have nothing but silence. So I call. Again. Rep 1 is back. “Didn’t you get my calls?”
Yeah, you didn’t call me. At all. “So the issue wasn’t the issue, and the technician says that he didn’t actually do the test drive. But he isn’t comfortable doing it until you replace your wheel bearings, so $900 and then we can try to fix the problem. But don’t worry, we took the price of fixing the not issue off the bill.”

What. The. Absolute. H.E.L.L (edit: I guess the swear filter decided to pick this up. Funny, I thought I was self censoring this.)

Now we get to me being angry. “You’re telling me that not only do you not know what’s wrong with my car after having it for a week, but now to find out I have to spend almost a thousand dollars before you’ll even do it? And on top of that, the technician who is working on my car and telling you things is lying about the work he’s doing on my car?”

“Oh, yeah, that sounds bad...”

Now I have to speak to the manager. I used to work customer service, I hate being the “let me speak to the manager” guy. And these idiots are making me do this.

“What’s the problem sir?” Insert almost verbatim repetition of above comment. “I’m just as angry as you are sir.” No you aren’t, but I’ve been there you’re saying the same things you’re supposed to. “I’ll have my foreman look at it. But he isn’t in today.” Of-flipping-course he isn’t. “But I’ll call you with information tomorrow morning.”

Uh huh.

Tuesday morning, no phone call. No nothing. 11:30, I get a text. “We’re working on the diagnostic now.” Isn’t it funny how now the wheel bearings aren’t a problem? “I’ll give you a call in a couple hours with the results.”

Uh huh.

That night I get another text message (see: things that aren’t phone calls). “Issue resolved, we are going to make sure it’s fixed but the car will be ready tomorrow.” I ask when I can expect his phone call. “10 am.”

Uh huh.

Wednesday morning comes and goes, and now it’s later in the day. My phone rings. It’s Rep 1! “Your car is ready for pickup, total bill is $240.” Isn’t that just fan-freaking-tactic?

I get off work, I get to the dealership. It’s close to closing, and Rep 1 says “didn’t think you’d be coming in!” 

The last of my brain cells slowly seep out my skull as I struggle to say “yeah I had work, and your call was later than I expected.”

Rep 1 doesn’t notice any of my popped blood vessels, and keeps going. “As I was getting the paperwork together I noticed how bad it all looks. So we knocked it down to $140. But hey, we gave you the same estimate to fix the wheel bearings if you want to come back!

I pay. I get my car. I leave. The words “as I looking at the paperwork I noticed how bad it all looks” ring in my head. They haunt my dreams.

When I inquired about this, they said that these service items should have been offered at 30k miles and yet, when I brought this car in for service at that time, these service items were never discussed then.

146,"October 16, 2018","I normally work with Christian @ the Mazda Maita, but he was out the day I needed my car serviced. Two odd alerts continued popping up in my dash, two of which the manual said were emergent issues and to be serviced immediately. After the 3rd time this occurred in my vehicle, I decided to bring it into the dealership. Paul, whom I have never worked with, vaguely explained the situation and did not guarantee a fix as this wasn't a consistent occurrence. He said if it takes longer than 10 minutes to isolate the issue, that he would indeed need to charge me $145 for the labor. (10 minutes of ""looking"" = $145). I then asked him then what would I need to do to make sure that these lights didn't pop up again? Paul said I would need to just bring the car back in. I told him I would take a loaner car as his next availabe appointment was @ 715am the following day. I get into the loaner car; there is less than a quarter tank left and the car is dirty with past passenger trash in the vehicle. I figured the less than quarter tank would at least get me to and fro the dealership to home to work back to the dealership. No, not enough so I fill the tank with $15. I get off work expecting my car to be done as my appointment was at 715am. It is 2pm and I am approaching the dealership. Paul answers the phone and says the car has not even been worked on as my battery died the night before? The night before? If the battery died the night before (unbeliavable as my full car check up said my battery life was good), why didn't he call me the NIGHT before? Why did he wait until i called him to PICK UP MY CAR? I had explained to him the night before that i would not have any service as work as I work in a hospital, so that anything that needed to be discussed needed to be doneso the night of or early morning before. Paul said he called 4 times and left 1 message. I did not have service. Calling did nothing. So because my battery died he had to wait to isolate the issue and look into my car. I was frustrated and explained to him that because of this, I now needed to fill up the tank with an additional $10 to just get back home and back and that with this I needed to purchase a $150 battery. My total spent on this car BECAUSE the lack of communication and lack of professionalism cost me over $300. THe issue? The battery was ""dead"". So now apparently all the emergency lights are fixed and they still charged me the ""service charge of $145"" because it probably took barely over that 10 minute mark where if it took longer than 10 minutes, they still charge. Paul wasn't there the day i picked up my car, so i explained to christian my frustration. he apologized, yet still did nothing about reimbursing me for the gas that i had to pay for. Paul explained that some passengers don't filll up the tank so that is why the gas was so low. ...So I have to pay for other drivers gas?? A $35 worth of gas? Unbelievable. I really enjoyed coming to Maita Mazda for my car services, but I am positive I was overcharged hundreds of dollars and also positive that they have no regard for the customers as they did not apologize or reimburse me for the gas of other car loaners.

No one, after waiting three hours for their car, should have to clean out the plastic sheet and cardboard from the driver's seat area.

I believe it was one of the best car-related decisions I could have made!  From the minute we hit the door, we were treated with respect and courtesy; There was no pack of hungry salesmen waiting for us.  We had been told to ask for one person in particular, and that person came out right away.  We had a friendly discussion about what I was looking for, and we were off to look at the different models in person.  The GM checked in on us during the sale, and the finance manager was friendly and helpful.  After the sale my salesman came back out and spent a lot of time with me helping to adjust all the electronics in the car and gave me his card in case I had any questions.  I have never had a salesman that was so knowledgeable about the product he was selling.  Every person we met was great, and I look forward to bringing the car to Maita for its regular servicing.

Got back to the dealer and ran some numbers and shook the hands of the gents insuring me of my new ride. 

Kelly was extremely helpful through this whole process. He provided me with pertinent information anytime and even followed up with me after to see how things were going.

256,"July 23, 2018","Already working in a service dept. of a different dealership and knowing the hiccups and shortcomings of a typical sales department, it's refreshing to have a great experience buying a car at a different dealer. This is how car buying SHOULD BE (very cliche, right?). I was looking for a specific used vehicle - a Smart to be exact - and they had what I was looking for in the color I wanted as well. 

Ira, my salesperson was great! He made the process smooth, quick and flawless. I initially made an inquiry that morning online, Ira called within minutes and confirmed it was there. Told him I was working and would be there later in the afternoon. Got there - road tested - liked it - agreed on an awesome price - waited for final prep and finance (Beth is was very friendly and clear on paperwork as well) - finished that - got into my newly cleaned, freshened up and gassed up Smart, and sped away (yes sped away, floorin' that bad boy to 85mph!) into the sunset of Hwy 70 North (ew, I know). Clean car became bug ridden again, but hey, I just had one of the easiest experiences buying a car. I was in and out in maybe 45 minutes, including my extended road test.

276,"July 06, 2018","I was contacted by Maita within hours of posting this review and they arranged to have my windshield replaced -at my residence- without further question. The work has now been completed (Mon, 7/9) I appreciate the speed with which the issue was resolved and that it was handled with little to no inconvenience to me. Sometimes things go wrong, and I am satisfied that Maita acted swiftly and appropriately to make things right, which is an important quality for any service industry.
-------------------------------
Dropped off my CX5 for recall work yesterday (fuel line & hatch). Even though their charges for oil change and 'check engine' light diagnostics were considerably higher than my local mechanic, I authorized these services for convenience's sake (two hours travel time to dealer, plus several hours for recall work, I figured might as well knock it all out at once).
1.) When I picked up my car, I found a massive 16"" CRACK IN THE WINDSHIELD. I grabbed the departing service advisor to inform him that my windshield had been cracked, and he spent a good deal of time reviewing photos (presumably taken during service) to corroborate my 'claim' that the windshield was without defect at drop-off. The photos of course showed an uncracked windshield, but he insinuated it must have been caused by an existing chip and that I would have to wait until Monday to talk to the service manager. 

I am not amused. I am, in fact, exceedingly angry and mildly insulted. I understand that things happen, and that some customers try to pull one over on service providers and that said providers have got to cover themselves, but this was ridiculous.

2.) Mazda. The service engine diagnostic came back indicating a need to replace the heater coil at a cost of $2200. Shocked at such an expensive repair for a just-off-warranty 3+ year old vehicle, I did some Googling and found legions of people getting hit with the same known defect. Also, a large variance in the replacement cost from $1200 to $2400 from dealer to dealer. Seems like Mazda is trying to avoid yet another recall on this vehicle to me, and that some dealers are cashing in more than others. 

I hope that Maita's service manager will contact me first thing on Monday and have a less defensive attitude about my presumption that a car dropped off with no crack in the windshield should not be returned with a massively cracked windshield. I'm confused by this whole experience - did they think I wouldn't notice? I just don't understand.

I hope that Mazda will at some point acknowledge this problem with the heater coil and make right by their customers. 

But for now, I am pissed at Maita for cracking my windshield and trying to imply they didn't, and I will not be purchasing, or recommending the purchase of, a Mazda brand again.

277,"July 06, 2018","I went in for an oil change. Waited 3 hours for it even though I had an appointment. On my way home, I heard noises from the bottom of my car. The dealership already closed by then. The next day, I called them. The operator said the technician was with a customer and he would call me back. He never called me back. I drove the car later on, the noises were still heard. I went to check the bottom of my car but didn’t see anything. When I was on the freeway, a very loud noise came from the bottom of my car and it made me swerve. It took me a few miles to pull over to a safe spot. I saw that the whole undercarriage cover under my car had fell off to the ground. So, whoever did the oil change either didn’t screw the bolts back securely or he completely forgot to even put the bolts on it. The undercarriage cover is pretty much ruined.

Then I called around to a few standard repair shops...and they were all about the same for that particular repair.

This is the first Mazda I've ever owned, and I needed some quotes (and had some general questions) a few months ago. Christian was super helpful, which I remembered. So I came back to Maita to have the recall AND the repair done.

I was blown away by...well, everything! From being able to book online (not to mention the Developers had the forethought to include ""add to your calendar"" functionality), to little bags of potato chips in the waiting room. And Lyft, they use Lyft now instead of a shuttle! And not only did they include a free car wash, but the repairs were done way faster than quoted or I expected. 

And Ricky, the Service Advisor, was amazing.

I had made an appointment, which means they should take me in at the time I reserved. Apparently, there were other cars ahead of me, which I can understand having to wait another 15 mins or so, no biggie, but two hours for a simple oil change? That’s ridiculous. I came in a time prior for a look at my car, since a part had been recalled. They said it would take between an hour and a half to 3 hours, depending on if the part needed replacing. I asked to be dropped off at the mall and picked up when it was done. They were nice to give me a lift and I walked around for the time. I was at he mall for 4 hours, waiting for a call. I called them, they said they haven’t even started on my car because of a pile up of other cars. I told them to pick me up and I would take my car to another shop. They picked me up, and when I got there, they had started on my car, so I had to wait another hour before I got my car back for a part that didn’t need replacing... don’t get me wrong, the people were nice and they apologized for the 5 1/2 hour wait for a 1 and 1/2 hour job, but when i make an appointment, I would hope they would stick to that appointment time vs the walk ins",3.4

She hands us off to another salesperson (B), who refuses to give that quote with the 0% financing, saying that quote is only available with standard financing. He brings over the original salesperson A over, and then she says ""yes that quote is only available with standard financing""! I show salesperson A the multiple e-mails and texts that she sent me confirming the quote with 0% financing, and she said ""I apologize, I must've made a mistake."" The manager would not honor the quote either, even though when we were texting, she mentioned the sales manager was right there with her. They tried to brush it off as a misunderstanding or a mistake, even though they confirmed multiple times that they could do that price with 0% financing.

We did have a good experience  with Daniel over the phone, invited us to visit Maita the following day ( Sunday) with his lowest price offer compared to  discount thru Costco.Everything was smooth until we went to see the finance officer.  
Vang Xiong talked to us in a rush, he talked to so fast and not fully absorbed what he was saying which were very critical in decision making. We explicitly explained to the Daniel that we wanted a 72 month plan, assuming that we have been talking about a 72 month plan, we bought all the add ons on 72 month plan. We got home, reviewed the small prints of the agreement and found out that it was an 84 month plan. We went back to see Vang Ziong to modify the plan. Took off all the add ons to be on the 72 month plan. I think we were mislead from the start when we went to see him, paying same monthly but on a longer term so we can get all the add ons.
It was a lot of hassle. Good lesson for us next time when buying a car.  Not to be in a rush when buying a car and read the fine prints and the details of the agreement before leaving the dealership. Also its a good idea to record the conversation. ",3.5

453,"July 11, 2017","I was given a pleasant and easy sales experience at Maita Subaru, my salesperson was Taylor Klisiewicz. Unfortunately a few days after taking this lightly used vehicle home I noticed that the stereo control panel was unresponsive, none of the buttons responded to being pushed and I was unable to change the radio or select a different audio source. I immediately called the dealership and was told to call back to schedule an appointment (I live in SF, the dealer is in Sac). A few hours later I got back in the vehicle but this time the control panel worked, being optimistic and not wanting to spend a whole day driving out to Sacramento I called the dealer back and said that I thought it was working again. The issue persisted into the next few days and I decided to just bite the bullet and go back to have it fixed. I called Taylor directly and explained the situation, after going back and forth with mechanics and various others at the dealership it was decided that because i didn't buy the $1,200 extended warranty they would not be able to help me. Essentially the dealer had sold me a poor product and was refusing to stand behind it and fix the situation. I expressed my dissatisfaction to Taylor and he said he would get me in contact with someone else at the dealership. After not hearing from anyone for a few days I sent him a text message with no response and wrote an email to the dealership (also no response). I highly recommend that anyone considering Maita save themselves the trouble and buy from someone else. The feeling of forking over 16k to a business and then having them refuse to even fix your radio a few days later is not one i'd wish upon anyone. Happy car hunting!",1.8

Jeff listened to what happened at Elk Grove Subaru and guaranteed me that he would not waste my time.  the purchase of a new car is a not like buying a new pair of shoes, and certainly you can not return it if you feel it does not fit.  

I was and am SO pleased with the customer service and the knowledge of the staff.  Knowledge, yes, I forgot to mention this. The Elk Grove staff were Absolutely not a subject matter expert.  Perhaps they should sell shoes.

Since the first time, this dealership has been more like a friend than a car dealership. They treated me so well with my first car, not to mention I got a lease deal on my car that I couldn't refuse. The people were always warm and helpful, and not-pushy ever. Now, with my latest car, I don't even live in the area anymore, in fact I'm 3 hours drive away, and I made the excuse to see a friend nearby and drive back to Maita to get my new car rather than going to my local dealership. Even though there are a lot of new faces there since my fist time, they still just seem to operate with such a warmth and helpfulness, and this time I even settled everything over the phone so I could just come and finish the deal and pick up the car. It was seemless and the salesman working with me made me feel like I made a friend (which has been the case with previous salespeople I've worked with there, I even stay in touch with one of them years later).

    Mr. Ozwald  was very knowledgeable about the different models and their features. He took over an hour explaining all the features of the vehicle and demonstrated how to operate all of them.  The only problem is that there are so many features, it is somewhat of a memory overload. He also went
through all the manuals and reference materials with us.
  Lisa Park made the paperwork process almost painless, except for the amount of papers
that have to be explained and signed.

502,"December 07, 2016","I was initially referred to MAITA Subaru by the COSTCO AUTO program.  I was in the market for a new Outback 2.5i (base).  

I was quickly contacted by no less then TWO sales people acknowledging my request.  Both Rob Pierce and Sherry Kharrazain were polite and offered every assistance possible in my new car search.

Sherry was very quick in issuing my offer for the exact car I had requested.  

Only one small, itty bitty glitch... THEY DONT ACTUALLY HAVE THE CAR!!!!! The car is due to arrive 12/27... 22 days from my initial request!!!!

As I found out, the base models are very sparse in the region, I understand not being able to fill my request.  HOWEVER, perhaps the email start with the fact that the cars are NOT in stock!??!?!?

Why would I want to make an appointment for a test drive if you won't have anything close to what I am requesting for more then 20 days???

I especially liked being told I could pay $500 as a deposit to hold the car, so when it does arrive... I get first dibs.  

THE BEST PART:

After a simple internet search, I found the car I was looking for at a competing dealer within the region.  I bought the car upon inspection.

As a courtesy, I called Sherry to thank her for her time and its not her fault that she doesn't have the cars in stock.  

Sherry was very gracious, HOWEVER, I find it very tacky to ask how much I paid for the car I did get!!!!

NOT AT ALL professional!  Want to better serve customers?  Have cars in stock or be HONEST when you email and state that they are in transit!

Regardless of what I paid, the deal occurred because the car was IN STOCK!!!!

ENOUGH DEBBIE DOWNER...


The Parts DEPT guys are great!!!!

Quick, no pressure, and even fast to apply coupons I didn't have access to.

So, on Monday I get a call from the finance manager saying financing fell through, and I would either have to come up with more money or return the car.  I asked how much more via email, no reponse on that.  I informed them that I would return the car, and we can leave it at that.  I think from a business perspective that it is very poor way for a dealership to operate, where a customer is not fully approved by financing before the customer drives off with the vehicle, and despite what I thought was great customer service this particular issue is just unprofessional.  If there had been any question, I could have waited until Monday to find out, not after I take the vehcile home.

One identified themself as the ""Costco Director"" while the other, although claiming to be a Costco sales rep for the dealership, seemed to be part of the regular sales consultants.

Later that morning, I decided to go by Maita Mazda since I could get an oil change while I was there, and check in with their Costco director.  I did check-in with my contact.  We weren't interested in a test drive that day since we knew what we wanted, and unfortunately, there was nothing on the lot that interested us.  I told my contact what I wanted to see if I can get a Costco dealsheet.  I was told since they didn't have anything in stock, they couldn't produce one, but basically the Costco deal is $500 off invoice.  Unless you are getting a car in high demand, you can get $500 off invoice if you sneeze at a car lot, so I was surprised at how underwhelming the Costco deal seems as portrayed by the staff.  I had previously purchased a Mazda 2 year ago through Costco at a dealership in Roseville and knew from the deal, the Costco price was so good I bought the car on the spot.

While I was there waiting for my car to finish its service, another roving sales person approached me.  I told him I was just there for a service, and he flippantly said something like ""fine, I'll buy it back for a trade-in.""  I am perfectly happy with the current Mazda and didn't appreciate the hardsell.  I told him I was already working with the internet department to make him go away.

Before I left the dealership, I let my contact in the internet department know that I am interested in obtaining one if they can get it or get more in their inventory.  The next day, the other sales person who originally emailed me called again to see if I was coming in and I told him I was already there yesterday.  He tried to get me back in the dealership again, but I made it clear that because of work and family obligations, I didn't plan to drive out their from Davis just to chitchat.  If they had my car, then fine, otherwise, it would not be a good use of my time.

But over the next few days, this guy kept calling and emailing me, which eventually led to him texting me.  I contacted my internet rep to let them know that I'm fine working with either them or this other sales guy, but they need to figure it out who's to be my point of contact.  Again, I emphasized what I was looking for and asked to be notified if they get that or more stock for me to consider.

In case the Costco deal was truly underwhelming and not just a misrepresentation or poor representation of the savings by the dealership, I decided to try another online car buying portal called TrueCar.

Through TrueCar, I was networked to the Mazda dealership in Elk Grove.  I reached out to them by email on a Monday morning, and casually exchanged emails with their General Sales Manager throughout the day.  It was low key and no pressure whatsoever to get me out to their dealership.  Using the Mazda USA website, I thought they had a similar vehicle to what I was looking for, but when I asked, they told me it was their error and that vehicle was unavailable.  I told the sales manager what I wanted, and within the hour he responded to tell me it was available in the region, and he can get it transferred to Elk Grove by the next day.  Without even committing to the transfer, the sales manager was willing to explain to me the TrueCar deal and break down the costs for me.  I confirmed that the deal being offered would be for the vehicle that wasn't even on their lot yet, and was told yes.  When I agreed to the fair price (which I was able to confirm beforehand through other sources), Mazda of Elk Grove was able to transfer the car the same day and arrange for a pickup for me the next day to finish the deal.

This was a deal that could have potentially been done through Maita, but because they seemed wishy washy and was more focused on getting me back on the lot rather than working with me online to make the deal happen at a fair price, they turned me off with their overbearing nature and hardsell practices and drove me into the waiting arms of Mazda of Elk Grove.

Over a few weeks we decided on the color and minimum options we wanted - leather, power tailgate, EyeSight, and navigation.  Jamie at Maita was very easy going and made us feel comfortable; he really wanted us to understand and appreciate the Forester.  So when we were ready to test drive we called him for an appointment.

Their test drive car was high end, with all the bells and whistles.  We were allowed a long test drive, going home to see if the tailgate could open in our garage, and over several roads and routes we were familiar with.  We were sold on the car and the options.  

We told him to call us when one came in with the options and color we wanted.  Dang if one hadn't come in the night before.  It still had all the plastic on the inside and the white paper on the outside.  So we sat down to see if we could afford it.

We were pleased to deal with Jamie throughout the whole process, though he had to 'check' with management a few times.  We quickly realized we couldn't afford to buy the car.  We then explored leasing.  Maita was able to get a monthly lease payment well under what we had in mind, with a minimum down payment.  Then we dealt with Eric for all the paperwork.  Another very pleasant fellow.

Did we get the absolute lowest deal?  No.  But we felt we got a very fair deal.  Always negotiate from the dealer's invoice.

We'd go back if we knew we were going to deal with those gentlemen.  We will be taking our car to Maita for service.  We would definitely recommend them.

612,"September 10, 2015","I'm usually not the person who takes time to write a ""negative"" review online. But this was my first car buying experience in USA and it was the worst. I am extremely unhappy with the quality of service and want to voice my opinion on this forum.

I had been researching on new compact and midsize cars for a couple of months and decided to get a mazda. I test drove a few cars at a couple of dealerships and decided to go with Maita Mazda, Sacramento. The salesperson, one Mr. John Reid, was not at all responsive and seemed so uninterested in selling the car. 

I finally got an appointment from this person to complete the purchase process and he said he would be there. On the day of the appointment, after I left for the dealership, he ""texts"" me saying that he may not be able to make it. I couldn't believe that a salesperson can be so irresponsible failing to provide the customer sufficient notice before trying to cancel the appointment. However, he was able to make it and was late to his own appointment. By this time I was a little doubtful about his interest in selling me the car. He was callous in taking my details for the credit application and after an additional wait for about half an hour, came upto me and said the car was gone and that somebody else bought it. This can happen to anyone so I tried to ask if there was a chance for a dealer trade. 
At this point, he started making passive aggressive comments while he was talking to me and my friends saying that I lost a perfectly good deal by being late in making a decision. I ignored it and waited for the dealer trade option.  I felt so unaccommodated at the counter that I wanted to leave . After an hour long wait, he came to me and said mazda doesn't finance people with an immigrant visa. I confirmed this over phone before I made an appointment and he said everything is absolutely fine. It seemed like he was trying to find reasons to send me away..lol! 
He told me it would take him a day to get back to me regarding the financing option. 
I never heard from him again after that. It almost felt like he knew the car was gone but just didn't care to inform me about it. Maybe he thought he could sell another car to me on the spot..I don't know. I DO NOT RECOMMEND this dealership to anyone or at least I advise caution while choosing the salesperson you deal with.

I returned two months later ready to move ahead, but was very nervous about what the whole process would entail. Bogdan was again very helpful, accommodating and calming. I was impressed with his willingness to do whatever was needed to assist in the process.

No only did Kay go out of his way to make sure I was comfortable with my new Mazda he made sure I would be happy with the car I picked and didn't try to hard sale me into getting a car that was much more expensive with things I really didn't need.

Daniel found a 2006 Toyota Highlander for me with the third row of seats that I needed and that fit in my price range.  He enlisted the help of Glen Berni, the general manager, to get the most out of my trade and the best possible interest rate for my loan.  When it came time to sign all of the paperwork, Eric Stroud, the finance manager, explained everything very clearly and arranged some extra coverage as well.  From start to finish, Daniel, Glen, and Eric made the car buying process easy and enjoyable!  I highly recommend this dealership, and especially these gentlemen, to anyone looking to purchase a new car.",5.0
676,"November 02, 2014","After doing some research on Mazdas, I came to the conclusion I wanted to do Business with Maita Mazda in Sacramento. I arrived and ended up working with DJ. What a great and funny guy. I have ""challenged"" credit as I was told during the process. Alex, the big russian teddy bear Manager went to bat for me and made everything work. Thank you again Maita Mazda!",5.0
677,"October 03, 2014","I had a terrible experience at Maita Mazda a couple of weeks ago. I am a return customer at Maita Mazda and picked out a CX5 and wanted to trade in my 2014 Mazda 3. I was told to go home and they would get back to me. At 6PM I received a call back stating they were able to work the numbers and to come down to sign the paperwork. I got my newborn baby ready and drove all the way down to the dealership. When I got there it was a different CX5 from the one I picked out and my payments were $100 more than I wanted. I felt embarrassed and lied to so I ended up leaving. I was told that I could only get the base model due to my credit. No one asked me if I could get a co signer (which my mom would have done for me)
I went to a different Mazda dealership and was only there for an hour and a half and left the dealership driving a 2015 Mazda 6 Grand Touring which I picked out and love. 
Not only did Maita Mazda lose a sale but they lost my confidence in them. Hopefully this will not happen to another customer.",1.0
678,"September 16, 2014","Can be described with two words: ""awful service"". Service person was alright but the sales manger wasn't nice at all. Yet better it seemed we were the only ones to know the difference between different trims. Thus despite a fact that a decent deal was offered after an hour of negotiation we just walked away and end up buying from a different dealership. ",2.2
679,"February 02, 2014","If your willing to wheel and deal, and go fight for a price, then you will be okay with this dealership. 

If there was a ""kind of"" option for the recommendation I would have gone with that. I don't really have anything bad to say about them, not a lot good to say either. They were willing to bring the price down a good amount though.

I ended up buying my car from a different location not because these guys were bad, just because the other place was better. ",3.4
680,"December 02, 2013","Maita Mazda and Jim made our car buying experience easy and we feel like we got a great deal with the incentives that were offered.

681,"August 03, 2013","Bought a Lexus RX330 from Maita Subaru and we were very happy with the purchase. They delivered on everything they promised. After looking for months I was very familiar with what a good deal was and we feel we got that from Maita Subaru, the price was even as good or better then most private party sales. The salesman was Jim Thuerwachter and he's not a hard sell type guy, very personable and I felt that he cared, obviously they want to maintain a good reputation. Highly recommend Jim. ",4.8

683,"October 13, 2012","I had the most amazing experience with Maita Mazda!  Zeke Wong is the most imformative, kind, and helpful Sales Rep. I have ever dealt with in any dealership!  I also worked in Sales for Automotive Advertising.. So I have experience with Automotive Dealers..  Well, I must say, that I got all the best services you would want going to a dealership!  Attentive, fast, and no B.S....  They weren't pushy, but very informative.  I am very happy with my new car and wouldn't reccommend anyone going anywhere else!  Zeke truly was amazing and even put note tabs in my manual to help me on any common questions I may have on my car!  Thank you Zeke and staff at Maita Mazda for an amazing experience!!

684,"August 08, 2012",Went in to purchase a new vehicle. Had contacted dealership prior to visit and they had agreed to match a competitor's price.  Salesman was great but otherwise a nightmare.  Not only was the agreed upon deal not honored but the finance person dropped the ball and it took 3 repeat visits to the dealership to complete the sale.  Would have gone elsewhere except the salesman did his job and I didn't want him to lose his commission.  No apology from management or finance for their screw-ups and no compensation for the inconvenience and ineptness of the finance department.  Wrote a letter to the manager and received no response.  Never again!,1.4
685,"August 02, 2012","We showed up at the Maita dealership on the work of a close friend who had purchased a Forester from this great dealership.  We were shown all available cars, by Frank and Al, our questions were all answered, and the deal closed.  Since then we have had things added to her by the Maita Service Department.  The work was completed far faster than we expected, and done perfectly.  We have named her, Ruby Tuesday because we bought her on a Tuesday, and she is red.  An attempt on my part to name her Yokahama Mamma did not fly!

Would I recoment Maita for buying a car?  YES!!!!   Would I recomend Maita' s Service Department?  YES!!!!

Thanks to all of you at Maita.

686,"April 10, 2012","Sales Manager Glen Berni bent over backwards to give us enough to help us drive out wit our Best car ever !  
He responded to my email quote request right away and was very courteous both online and in person. He was incredibly helpful, not pushy at any moment, and just a pleasure to deal with. I never got the weird, high-pressure sales vibe from him. I had been researching a variety of different cars in depth and had narrowed it down to three options. My husband and I went to a few different dealerships to test drive models and talk prices. We ended up at Maita to drive the Impreza, but they didn't have any on the lot that matched our needs. Phil took us down to their holding lot, to walk around a new shipment to find one for us, in the rain. He is super knowledgeable about both Suburu's and Mazda's. I just wasn't a fan of the Mazda. The Impreza, though, fit our needs so well. We negotiated a price, which felt more like a conversation than anything. Phil went out of his way to find us a car at another dealer that matched the features we wanted, and even went along to drive it up here. He helped expedite our paperwork so I could get to work on time that night. The other staff members were helpful as well. We felt well taken care of, and Phil even offered his email to help answer any questions we may have later. Overall, the experience was a great one, especially as it topped a week in which my beloved Scion got totaled by a kid running a red light.
Phil Gundry provided us with the most courtesy and knowledge of his product than any other salesman we spoke with while shopping for our new vehicle. He was most patient in helping my wife and I find exactly the right vehicle for us. The entire experience gave a feeling of professionalism, courtesy, friendliness and caring. I must say that the final price of the vehicle was very fair and very easily accomplished thanks to Phil and Alex. Vang was very professional and thorough with the paperwork and financial part of the purchase. I will most definitely return to Maita Subaru Mazda again to purchase a vehicle and will recommend this dealer to my family and friends. ",5.0
687,"March 21, 2012","Maita Subaru is great.  Have used Maita service back when it was Maita Hyundai (we purchased s new 2005 Hyundai Sonata).  Since 2005 we've used Maita for everythibg from purchase to all maintenance work.  They are always friendly, and since we only have one car now (2009 Forester) it is very nice to get shuttle service from the dealer to my home, and then back to the dealer when my car is ready - that is a reat service thatr I reallky appreciate.  They make life easy for this senior citizen.",5.0

689,"December 18, 2011","he sales side of the easy going and low stress and that's where it ends.

But, some of the folks in parts and service side need to be replaced.  I had to take my 2010 Forester in 3 times to correct an issue with the interior mirror that had become loose and would vibrate and clunk while driving.  I would point out the issue and the techs were able to duplicate the problem.  They even went as far as to replace all parts of the interior mirror, except the part that was bad.  

On my visit last weekend, they finally corrected the issue.  After living with a loose and rattling up mirror for 15k miles.

Last weekend I also decided to purchase wiper inserts from the parts counter so that I could install them the following day.  I left the counter with the front two inserts and had wanted to replace the rear one, but they don't stock the part.  Anyway, the following day (Sunday) I attempt to replace the inserts and low and behold, I was sold the WRONG PART!  I guess it's too much to ask for a dealer to supply the correct wiper insert.  So, I called the office and found that they are unable to do anything about it until later in the week because the parts department is closed.   The lady who answered the phone less than understanding and didn't appear to care about the issue.

I event went as far as to write the parts and service manager through Maita's website.  It has been a week and i have not received a response.  

I WILL NEVER VISIT THIS DEALER AGAIN.
I WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANOTHER SUBARU AGAIN.

Thanks,
Bill Freeman

690,"July 16, 2011","This is a worst nightmare situation - unbelievable. I &quot;sold&quot; my car July 1 - today is July 16 and THEY STILL HAVE NOT PAID ME. 

BUT THEY ARE SELLING MY CAR!
http://www.maitasubaru.com/detail.cfm?ID=84809&amp;V=2010%20Subaru%20Impreza%202%2E5i

They lie, they avoid, they insult -- it's just unbelievable.   They give nonsense answers and refuse to admit they CAN pay me, they just don't want to (classic: I asked how it works when someone trades in a vehicle and walks out with a new one.. and was told - actual quote, I made sure to write it down - &quot;Look, I don't want to be put on the spot, I have 4 people waiting for me&quot;. this was from Al Palmer.

I have been put through to service technicians instead of financial officers 
(see &quot;Vang&quot; http://www.maitasubaru.com/special.cfm?ID=262&amp;Page=Our-Employees)

This list is truly endless. I am willing to discuss more if anyone has any questions. 
No one ever calls back, no one is available... 

After talking to a car salesman (for BMWs) it may be that they are having cash flow problems.... and can't pay me until they sell the car. if this is the case - stay away, because you will get some similar form of treatment, whether buying or selling. Desperation makes people ugly, and these guys are hideous 9although I do not know why they are doing this! but, yes, they are hideous). 

I just cannot believe I am experiencing this, I don't think I should have to -- and I don't want you to, either.
