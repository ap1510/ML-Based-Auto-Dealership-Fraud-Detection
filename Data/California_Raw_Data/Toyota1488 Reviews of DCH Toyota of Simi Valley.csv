0,"May 19, 2020","Although the dealer had good cookies and a licensed masseuse on some days of the week, the older staff was very rude and short with me (perhaps because I was younger). Although there were some great staff members sparsely between the staff, I was always treated by the older staff. Huge lack of respect, they talked down to me like a child rather than addressing me as a customer who was paying for their service. The moment my 2-year service ended, I immediately switched to the Toyota in Mission Hills where they provided much better customer service and treated me like a normal person. I do not know if it was my age, because I looked young, my student occupation at the time, my skin color, or even my quirky glasses - they definitely should not have treated me the way they have. It was ill-mannered and presumptuous. One instance, I accidentally dropped my service papers on the floor. Rather than kindly acknowledge my mistake and help, the representative said ""hey, you might need that buddy, it's money."" Completely unnecessary. Another instance, a representative did not believe me that it was my car, they belligerently questioned my ownership to the car. Although yes I did co-own it with my father, he did not believe that it was under my name, despite it being on the contract and on the service paperwork. A ridiculous excuse for childish behavior. Unfortunately, there are more bad cases than good cases on my behalf. I will never go back there again. ",1.8
1,"May 11, 2020","Very pleased with the interaction we had with Austin Cosby who was very professional, polite and dealt with my wife and I in a straightforward manner. Although it was late afternoon on a Sunday, we were able to drive the car home that very day. Not entirely prepared as I had left my checkbook home, he went to out nearby residence and was able to have him deliver the check back to the dealership. This is my 4th purchase over many years patronage at Simi Valley Toyota.

6,"July 09, 2019","Through the Costco auto buying program I was directed to Simi Toyota dealership.  On the phone I worked with Bryan Long, he very promptly returned my calls, answered my questions and accommodated my needs, if there was something to follow up on, he sure did follow through.
Once I made the decision to purchase, I visited Simi Toyota and worked in person with Brendan O’Neill, from the start he was very friendly, he already knew who I was and what I was looking for per info Bryan had provided.  Brendan presented me with facts and figures, and gave me the time and space to think things over and make a decision.  No pressure no hassle.  Once I had made a decision on a model, Brendan worked with his management to acquire the vehicle from another dealership, Brendan provided frequent updates and explained why the exchange between dealerships takes so long, they did nonetheless got the specific car I wanted, on the very same day.  Brendan stayed after hours to ensure the vehicle was as I expected when delivered.

It’s been a few months now, I have taken the care back to Simi Toyota for scheduled service, my experience with the service team has also been very positive.  ",4.4

Waiting area was comfortable and had one of those fancy coffee/cocoa/almost anything machines.  Donuts there also, but I think you have to get there early, as the last donut disappeared about 10:30 and the box was never replenished.  Wait time was as promised.  Could have used some newspapers in the area to help pass the time.  All I found was a week-old LA Times.  Overall, a good experience.",5.0

I just wanted an email address but they refused to provide one and instead insisted that I provide personal info (name, email, phone, address).  Then they ""hung up"" when I wouldn't provide it.

19,"January 07, 2019","Update of my review:

Although everything that I have written in the below review is correct, the matter has been resolved with the intervention of Larry Puryear, General Manager of DCH Toyota of Simi Valley.

About a week after the review I complained to Mr. Puryear via email about the damage to the moonroof of my car caused by DCH Toyota Service, Simi Valley. The email received no response. But when I sent the same email with pictures of the damaged moonroof to Mr. Puryear via certified mail, I received a call from him. At his suggestion I took the car over directly to him at the Service Center at DCH Toyota.. GM Larry Puryear was very courteous and pleasant. He assured me that the moonroof of my car would be fixed within 2 hours. In fact, it was fixed in half an hour, and now closes perfectly at both ends. 

Why couldn't the service manager, Michael Sheets, have done the same  on January 3 when I brought the issue to his attention? The matter would have stopped right there and there would have been no reason for me to publicly report my dissatisfaction?
*****************

I am very dissatisfied and upset with the Service and Repair section of DCH Toyota of Simi Valley - both with representative who attended to my car and the service manager, Michael Sheets, whom I met later. I've been getting my Camrys serviced at this place for almost 20 years because it is conveniently located. But it appears that the mechanics here cannot repairs. They only do expensive replacements. And, the management encourages this.

On Dec. 28, 2018 I brought in my 2005 Toyota Camry XLE car DCH Service to have only one issue looked at: A few days ago the automatic closing mechanism of the sunroof (moonroof?) of the car had suddenly stopped functioning properly: first it would close smoothly (a perfect fit),  then it bounced back a few inches. To close the moonroof entirely I had to press the button  a little a time  till the roof closed fully. But it did close fully - at both ends - and was a level and complete fit. I thought that the local Toyota place would know how to correct the automatic closing mechanism. The rep who took charge of the car was Juan Carlos. 

When the car was returned to me a five  hours later Juan informed me that they had taken the roof off and had tried to fix the problem but they could not fix it. I was charged $135 for this ""looking"" at the problem. He told me that the only option was to replace the roof for $2000. Since the car is old, and I didn't want to put that much money into a cosmetic feature, I asked Juan Carlos to have the roof put back as before - fully closed - and do no work on the car. I asked that the moonroof be fully closed as before, but otherwise did not need a new moonroof. (I had already test driven 2018 Camry XLEs at the dealership section of DCH Toyota of Simi Valley, but had decided to wait for the 2019 models, or an Avalon or even a Lexus.)

Although the DCH mechanics couldn't fix the problem that I asked them to help me with,  Juan Carlos cheerfully provided me with an unsolicited  list of suggested repairs and replacements, and another inspection for another $135. I was disappointed that they couldn't fix the automatic closing mechanism, but did not any further work done on that visit.
. 
Later, as I drove back I could hear the wind from the moonroof, but from inside the car I could see that the front of the sunroof was closed. It was later that I realized the wind was coming from the rear of the roof. The sunroof was now warped and while the front of the moonroof was in place, the rear end was lifted an inch higher than the roof of the car.. 

I got an appointment with the service manager, Michael Sheets, on the morning of 1/3. I explained to Sheets what had happened. All I wanted was to have the moonroof of the car closed back to a fully closed position - as it had been when I brought the car to DCH to have them to see why the moonroof would not close on its own. Sheets had a mechanic look at the moonroof for 5 minutes, and then gave me back my car keys saying that they couldn't put the moonroof back in its original position. He said that if they tried to fix the problem I would have to take the glass of the moonroof back in the trunk of my car - and no roof on the top of the car. My only option, according to Mr. Sheets, was to get a new moonroof for $2000.

I love the ride and reliability of Toyota Camrys. My current car is my third Camry - and I've been happy with all my Camrys. I'm not dissatisfied with the car. I am just dissatisfied with the quality of workmanship and customer service of the Simi DCH Toyota. This place has a legal responsibility to straighten the moonroof of my car - and seal it  to the clsosed position, if necessary. So far, I have received very poor customer service and poor workmanship, and it is my opinion that the reason for this lies in poor management policies.",1.4

21,"December 25, 2018","Watch for a rip off. They offer me 50% of the trade in value of my car posted by KBB. Showed me instant cash value by KBB pretending that’s my car trade in value. Beware!
Overpriced used inventory. If you decide to go there make sure you have KBB application installed on your phone and check your trade in value and value of what you buying.
Don’t let them run your credit unless you are 100% sure you will make a deal. Unfortunately I have a hard inquiry on my report for nothing.

27,"October 23, 2018","Don't buy from these people via internet unless you are close!  They didn't know how to deal with an out of state sale.  I told them I wanted the car...asked for total so my financing check would match. (They never asked or recommended for $ down to hold) While the GM was ""figuring it out"" apparently someone came in and purchased.   So much for being men and a hand shake deal.

It was $100+ for them to investigate the ""check engine"" light, so we approved that.

At first I thought ""great....$100 to screw the gas cap"" but the service guy said he did not charge for it!

41,"July 03, 2018","My husband and I were shopping for a car and we went to multiple dealers looking at Acuras, Hondas, and then Toyotas.  We stopped at Toyota of Simi and Kareem was the salesman that helped us. Kareem was extremely knowledgeable of all 3 vehicles we test drove and provided us with lots of information on all the features of each car.  He also was did not pressure or try to hurry us to make a decision which is extremely important to us.  We later spoke with Omar regarding pricing and payment options and financing. This is the step in the process we specifically do not like as you don't always get true transparency and are often pressured. Not in this case, Omar explained all our options and tried to get us in a price range that worked for us with and with no pressure.   We ended up buying an Acura from an Acura dealer as it was just the car I wanted. However, we were so impressed with the service both Kareem and Omar provided that we wanted to leave a review. We will be back to Toyota of Simi when my husband is ready for a new car as we know the buying experience will be smooth, informative and with no pressure.

I traded mine in and they were generous on that end as well. By this time it’s about 7:45pm, were waiting for finance to finish up another deal and Brian goes: “ Are you guys hungry? What do you like?” Honestly right there I was convinced that’s my dude right there. I mean not every sales person is that courteous to even think about that, let alone ask you that. The one other thing I’m going to say before finishing this review is, at NO point did I or my wife feel pressured to do this big purchase. They did their thing with numbers and they were about where I thought and hoped they be. So if you need to finance or lease a vehicle I %100 recommend Brian Lamb and the rest of the team at DCH.",5.0

71,"November 15, 2017","I had a 1996 4Runner with over a 400,000 miles on it.  She was a great car but her time had come.  I briefly considered other manufacturers but quickly decided to buy another 4Runner, but my specifications were unique.  I live on a dirt road which becomes a mud bog after a hard rain but this would be my families primary vehicle.  So I wanted some hardcore off-road features (KDSS, locking rear-differential, running boards, etc.) with some convenience features (moon roof, navigation system).  After visiting a few lots and spending some time on the internet it became clear that my combination of features was rare and ordering a vehicle was my likely route.  I talked to many dealers who simply had no interest in ordering a vehicle for me.  Others were willing with a significant markup.  Brian Lamb at Toyota of Simi Valley, was willing to do business with me at first contact.  His price was good, he was professional throughout and even gave me a good deal for my beloved '96.  We love our new 4Runner (which is already very dirty) and I have nothing but great things to say about Brian and his team.  Thank you Toyota of Simi Valley.",5.0
72,"November 13, 2017","We bought a new 2010 Sienna XLE and a Camry from Mr. Brian Lamb at DCH TOYOTA Simi Valley. He is energetic, always friendly, and professional.
One faithful morning, the Sienna with 119k miles, stop recognizing the keys after a short drive. It stayed four days in an auto shop, and three weeks in Simi DCH. It was concluded that immobilizer ECU is dead and requires a complete front wire harness set. The existing repairer bill is $1000 plus additional astronomical parts and labor cost without a guarantee of repair. TOYOTA does not have a wire harness in stock and the wait will be 3+ weeks. Everyone including TOYOTA agrees this is an extremely rare case. After calling TOYOTA for days, they agree to credit us a small amount toward future TOYOTA purchase. TOYOTA ask us to work out the bills and sales deals with the dealer.
Thanks to Mr. Brian Lamb and Mr. Randall Holt (Service), we were able to work out a reasonable deal toward a new 2018 Camry. I do not believe any other TOYOTA dealer will do the same. Simi DCH shows they value long term customer relationships. I highly recommend buying future TOYOTA from Mr. Lamb. He provided us a truly unforgettable life experience!",4.6

My sales person was Brian Lamb and he was assisted by Kelly.  Brian KNOWS his cars and earned our trust with the advice he gave to help us select the best car for the money.  We visited another local dealer before we went to DCH of Simi Valley and even though we had a comfortable relationship with the other dealer we were fortunate to end up with Brian and the Simi Valley DCH team.

Brian took the time to explain how the vehicle works and made himself available to help us understand what the car is able to do and that he will be available for additional instruction when we need it in the future.  We purchased a 2017 Prius and there is so much to learn that I am sure we will take advantage of his offer soon!

107,"April 11, 2017","In general, I hate the new car buying process. I have never come across a salesman that treats me with respect and they almost always try to play games. Brian Lamb is the first salesman that has treated me with respect through the whole month and a half car buying experience. At no point did I feel like I was being taken advantage of and he was nothing but informative and straight to the point every time. If I had the money, I would gladly go buy another truck from his today. I can not recommend him highly enough. I bought my 2017 Toyota Tacoma TRD Sport 4x4 from Brian on 4/4/17.

I randomly came across Brian after I sneaked past all the salesman in the front of the dealership so I could look at a truck in peace. Brian drove by and noticed I was alone. He asked if I had any questions or if I needed any help. I asked a few technical questions about the engine configuration (3.5L 6 speed vs 4.0L 5 speed), all of which he answered confidently and to the point. After I was done with questions, he told me his name and that if I need anything, to just ask. And like that, he drove away. No pressure to follow me around, no ""so when are we looking to buy"", no ""I could get you into this today"", just being helpful.

When I was ready to buy 2 weeks later (and many nasty salesman later), I emailed Brian and told him that I wanted to do business with him. We setup a meeting and placed a truck on order to be delivered about a month later. During that month, he kept me up to speed on any updates and when the truck was delivered, he had all the paperwork for a previously negotiated price (by far the best price I had seen) ready to sign and drive when I got there. I was in and out of the dealership in 1.5 hours. The best part was there was no games with the price. He was transparent through the whole process.

Would I recommend Brian... ABSOLUTELY! I can confidently say he is the only salesman that I have met that I would go back to. On top of that, I thoroughly enjoyed the process with him. We talked about aftermarket modifications, only to find myself in his personal truck looking at similar modifications. Who does that! I believe he is a genuinely nice, kind and helpful guy. I can also honestly tell you we have never met before running into him on the dealer lot.

Don't hesitate to call him, just do it. You won't regret it.",5.0

Ashley, the cashier who schedules the shuttle, was very poor service
 She scheduled my pick up way after it should have been
 She sent the driver to Moorpark instead of sending him to pick me up when I was right down the street   Resulting in me having to wait an hour for my pick up 
 I've never had to wait that long for any pick up 
she didn't look to see where my address was to coordinate a timely pick up 
she had her child at the counter when I was  finally able to get my car
 she was not available three times when I called and it went to her voicemail when I tried to call about my pick up  and why it was taking so long 
None of this is acceptable service!
 I have been coming to this service center for 30 years and never had such a bad experience or bad service!
when she heard my complaints at the counter upon getting my paperwork,, she not once apologized for the inconvenience or her lack of scheduling.
Instead she ignored everything she heard knowing full wee that  she's in charge of scheduling the shuttle.
 The driver relayed to me that this happens all the time and then he ends up getting the brunt from customers .

I have gone through problem after problem with my visit. They tell me it will take a hour for a routine service, and I end up waiting for 2 to 3 hours. I have no updates ever. It's really annoying because I do make the appointments (sometimes on Saturdays but also during the week too IF I can come in then, always in the morning)....This time, it took 4 hours when I was told a two hour wait. I had to be at work, and hate having that expectation being wrong. I am a patient person, always have been, but after numerous visits of this occurring, as well as being pushed into buying things my car doesn't need, I had it. Bill took care of me and same thing occurred but this was the worst. I came in for a oil change, and requested my parking brake be tightened (I had my breaks done a year ago there, was told that it was done then but it literally was SO loose, I thought it was going to come off). So they said they would do it. NEVER told me it would cost anything, and just gave me the estimate for the oil change.

Turns out the previous service writer for the breaks didn't disclose that I couldn't have it tightened at the time and he just told me it was done. That was upsetting. Bill got the manager, and she took care of the price of it, and they comped it for the breaks as they should. Bill was helpful, so was the manager (didn't catch her name). They listened to me vent, and I appreciated that!

152,"November 19, 2016","In September, my husband and I went to Simi Valley Toyota to look at a 2015 GMC Sierra, black that we saw in the internet. The truck looked nice, and that's what caught our eyes. It was $32,000, with 27,000 miles. We get there after a 1.5 hour drive, see the truck from the outside, get out to look at it. We had to stay there looking st it, going inside it, and my husband pops open the hood to look at it. No one comes out to see if we needed help to look at it. We go inside, I ask for the internet team and my husband gives his name, and this guy acts like he didn't know he emailed us about the truck. Then he took us out to look at it, and he acted like he didn't know nothing about it. Then we asked if we could talk to the manager about lowering the price. Then this heavy set Hispanic guy comes out, with a bad attitude tells my husband to close the hood, then he says if we want to test drive it. So my husband test drove the truck. The handle to the drivers side had black duct tape on it, and he said that's the way it looks, it was already like that. Then he drove the truck, we liked it, went inside to try to negotiate a deal. We said we have excellent credit. We have 820 credit rating, and 6,000 cash to put down. We wanted a comfortable payment of 400 a month, and this guy told us we had to put $10,000 down for a payment of 400 a month;). We told him with a credit of 820, he didn't even want to hear about the credit, he was acting like we didn't have credit, and that we had to put that huge down payment on a used 2015 GMC.  lol, that is for some one who don't have credit, we looked at him and said that was ridiculous. This company is a joke, A person with 820 credit should not have to put $10000 for a down payment on a used 2015 truck. We didn't even put that huge amount on our house. Toyota of Simivalley has bad service, a bad manager, lazy car salesmen that don't want to help you, and act like they don't remember your name when you ask for the internet department.

163,"September 19, 2016","I'm a High School Math Teacher in Simi Valley, CA.  On Aug 31, 2016, my wife and I purchased a brand new 2016 Toyota Rav4 XLE Hybrid from a truly wonderful salesman, Cody Segal (at DCH Toyota of Simi Valley).  I would recommend Cody Segal to any friends, colleagues, or students looking to buy a car.  Cody was knowledgeable and really cared about us finding what was right for our needs; we gladly put our trust in Cody, now and in the future.

We began our search several months ago.  My wife and I were planning on buying a 2-3 year old used Toyota with low miles.  We stopped by the Simi Valley Toyota dealership to test drive a Corolla, Camry, and Prius.  (Note that I have owned several Toyotas in my life; Supra, Camry, and 4-Runner - I like the dependability of Toyotas as well as the Human Engineered ride of the Toyotas...so, we were planning to buy a Toyota at all times.)  While at the dealership, I met the salesman, Cody Segal.  Cody also had us sit in the Rav4, and my wife immediately fell in love with this Crossover SUV...that decision was made, we wanted a Rav4!

At this time, we were still expecting to buy a used Rav4 rather than pay the price of a new vehicle.  But then I started reading online about the Rav4 HYBRID models.  I fell in love with the idea of this gas saving Hybrid, along with Toyota's front-running experience with Hybrids (because of their Prius background).  And since, the 2016 was the first year for the Rav4 to offer a Hybrid, there simply weren't any used ones available!  My wife and I started to consider buying a new vehicle just because we liked the Hybrid idea.

So, we started talking to Cody Segal about the pros and cons of New vs Used, Hybrid vs Gas-only, etc.  I kept on looking at the AutoTrader.com site to see used deals from private parties (on Gas-only Rav4s), and I also investigated Toyota Dealerships for Certified used Rav4s, but mostly, I kept in close contact with Cody Segal at DCH Toyota of Simi Valley.  Cody would tell me what was available in his Used Rav4 inventory, and we would have long discussions about getting a new Hybrid model.  Cody was always terrific; he never pressured us to buy one car over another.  Instead, Cody would listen to all my thoughts and concerns, and then give me excellent food for thought in his knowledgeable and always upbeat responses.

As we moved into August, Cody could see that we started to lean towards buying NEW, so we started getting down to business on price negotiations.  Keep in mind that since I'm a public school teacher, I registered with my union benefits to be able to receive ""Internet"" pricing from all the Southern California Toyota dealers (I also registered with AARP deals and something called Edmunds as well...but all these ""Internet"" pricing deals were basically the same.)  However, when I registered online, suddenly I was overwhelmed with e-mails from lots of Toyota dealerships here in So. Cal.  Now, I was dealing with lots of dealers, and they all wanted my business.  I started getting lots of price quotes, and frankly, I would discuss the deals with Cody at SV Toyota.  He never said a bad word about any of these other dealers; in fact, he often sincerely suggested we take one of the other deals if that would make us happy.

As August unfolded, Toyota's clearance specials began to surface (as the 2017s were going to be in showrooms soon).  Suddenly, there were rebates and financing options that started to significantly bring the prices down.  Now we were in full negotiation mode; we had decided on a brand new Rav4 XLE Hybrid, and all that remained was being able to afford it on my single teaching income!  I had a direct phone number for Cody, and I would call him day or night or weekend to fire questions at him, as well as try to negotiate an affordable price.  Cody, at all times, kept up his always-positive-attitude and would always try to accommodate my issues.  Again, note that I was also in contact with North Hollywood Toyota, Hamer Toyota, and Frontier Toyota as well...and believe me, they all wanted my business as well!

Finally, on Aug 31, we decided to bite the bullet and buy our new Rav4 Hybrid.  Cody had gotten us a great price for a new White 2016 Rav4 that he had on the Simi Valley lot.  Frankly, I wanted a Blue one, and that day, I spoke to a salesman at Frontier Toyota in Santa Clarita.  Frontier Toyota had the Blue one I wanted and they agreed to match the price we were offered at the Simi Valley dealership!  But when I discussed it with my wife, she said she would be happy with White, and we both agreed that we wanted to buy our car from Cody Segal in Simi Valley.  After two months of analysis and negotiations, we felt like Cody was almost family to us, and we were thrilled to finally do business with him.

We've now owned the car for less than 1 month.  We love it.  And every time I show my friends the car or tell my students about it, we bring up Cody.  He's the reason we purchased our car from DCH Toyota of Simi Valley, and we would not hesitate to buy other cars from him in the future!
Thanks Cody.  My wife loves our new 2016 Rav4 XLE Hybrid, and Happy Wife = Happy Life.  :)",5.0

177,"June 08, 2016","Brought my Camry in for some ""recall"" work, and asked them to check out an intermittent power window on front passenger side.  It would get stuck in the down position, but eventually go up after several pulls on the window switch. They said it would cost $125 to troubleshoot and do the estimate, that $125 can be used towards the repair cost. The estimate to replace the window motor was $706 ($392 for part and $315 for labor). I thought this was high, but agreed. After that work was done, I then received a call saying that the technician thinks that the motor failed because of a fault of the ""Master Switch"" . He also stated that if the Master switch is not replaced they would not warranty the original work, and I would be back at square one. The cost for the Master Switch was quoted at $430. So now they had me in a precarious position. I felt as if I was being extorted.   I was in too deep to take a chance and walk away with no guarantee on the work already paid for, so I reluctantly agreed. Total cost to fix an intermittent window was about $1,100. Does that sound reasonable? Sorry, not to me. I did some research on the same OEM parts they used, same part number, build to same spec, same part. Turns out the Motor assembly they charged me $391 for, I could get (online/Rockauto.com) for $75, and the $430 master switch I could get for $155.  So, they charged me over $800 for $230 worth of parts. I understand a ""dealer mark-up"", but a 350% markup cannot possibly be justified in my book. Or, is this just a case of the Service Personnel pushing unnecessary labor and overly inflated part prices to reap in greater commissions?  I own 2 Camry's, one was purchased at this dealership. Needless to say, I will not be returning for a new car, nor will I let them perform any repairs or maintenance of my vehicles.  I am even considering not going back for warranty service.  Shame on me for not doing my homework earlier and listening to my instincts. Shame on them for threatening no warranty unless additional repairs were done (whether they were needed or not), and marking up part prices to ridiculous levels. $1,100 to fix an intermittent window, really? This is a Toyota not a Ferrari!!!!  Bottom line, beware of their service department and verify/validate what they are trying to sell you. Question everything!",1.6

We needed a car with more seating than my Tundra could accommodate, so it was time to upgrade to a Sequoia. I reached out to TO Toyota regarding availability of a 2016 Sequoia and they informed me they didn't have what I was looking for. No explanation; no offers to help me get what I wanted. I reached out to DCH Toyota of Simi Valley and was lucky to partner with Brian Lamb. He too mentioned that they didn't have what I was looking for but explained that the Sequoia was currently in limited production but that he could try to get me exactly what I wanted from the plant. Brian kept his word and delivered. Within just 2 weeks, Brian was able to locate and request the exact Sequoia that I was looking for. It had not been built at that time, but during the entire process, Brian kept me informed of the build schedule, the shipping schedule and the arrival date. This had to have been the easiest car purchase I have ever been through. The fact that DCH Toyota of Simi Valley was willing to do all of this for me shows me that they put their customers first. We also dealt with financing and he did his job offering the pre-paid service plans and the extra add ons, but when we declined, there was no additional pressure put on us.

Che was the only trustworthy person we spoke with and the reason for the one star, otherwise they don't deserve any stars. After a test drive we sat down to go over the numbers. Everything was fine up to this point. Omar the manager came out. He came off as the typical used car salesman and my wife and I both didn't trust him. After agreeing on a price we met with Ron. Ron was extremely unprofessional. I understand that trying to sell the gap coverage and extended warranty is his job but the blatant lies and scare tactics were ridiculous . First he tried to convince my wife that our banks financing would have a cap on the gap coverage and we would be screwed, complete lie. Then he went into how expensive repairs would be and that since these cars are so new no mechanics would touch them and parts were extremely expensive. We kindly declined but he would not let up. He went on to explain if the key was $550 just imagine how much the parts are going to cost. It was amazing how unreliable he was making the car sound. If I hadn't done my due diligence  on researching the reliability of the Prius plus the extensive track record my wife and I have had with previous Toyotas, I would have walked out.

198,"July 04, 2015","Purchased a vehicle on 6/15/15 that included a trade-in; dealer sold the trade without paying me and continues to withhold funds citing an internal policy.

Dealer paid the loan balance on the trade but has yet to deliver the additional $7,212 equity payment to me personally. After repeated demands for payment, dealer cites internal policy preventing them from releasing the equity payment until a paper title is received from my bank.  Yet DCH is fully aware that the bank electronically released the lien and title through California DMV's Electronic Lien and Title Program on 6/23/15. No paper title is then necessary for the vehicle to be transferred to a new owner by the dealer, nor will a paper title be issued by the bank, as it can only come from the DMV by specific request from the dealer, if dealer so requires.  DCH is aware of this, as well.

So aware that the dealer has in-fact sold the trade vehicle already and is STILL withholding my equity funds.

This is in direct violation of CVC 11709.4(4), prohibiting the dealer to sell, consign for sale, or transfer any ownership interest in the vehicle until all balances are paid. They are in further violation of CVC 11709.4(1) by not agreeing to pay my equity funds within 21 days (7/5/15).

If this claimed internal policy is correct, this appears to be a deliberate business practice for unjust enrichment by withholding of funds that should have otherwise been released, thus saving the dealer interest expense from drawing down their credit lines to actually pay funds their customers are owed.

DCH Auto Group is a finely tuned machine for maximizing profits, and so be it, in a capitalist world.  But they should at least be held to the minimum standards of the law.

If you are going to trade, I recommend demanding a payment time-frame be included in the contract for the pay-off.  Any claim of risk about not receiving title is void as they will have not only possession but they are also only giving you wholesale value for the vehicle. (zero risk to DCH).  Negotiate accordingly or simply trade elsewhere",1.0
199,"June 02, 2015","This dealership is horrible..go to Hammer only 18 miles away. The Salesman didn't even care what car he was showing as he said ""They're all just cars to me"" And he didn't even know anything about the cars. I talked with the sales manager and he said ""we don't bend over backwards for customers. We just sell cars....""...Every ones attitude was terrible like you were in their way and had no time for you. No general customer service abilities at all. Even the General manager made me wait like 10 minutes before deciding to talk to me and then he just said ""I heard your conversation already so you know how to take care of this..."" and he walked away. I then told him to kiss my xxx. They are all very arrogant and really don't care about customers. Really just go some where else....if i could give them negative stars i would.

200,"May 15, 2015","I have purchased 3 cars from this dealership in past 15+ years and have always had a good experience.  I also have brought all my Toyotas (4) in for service in the same timeframe.  For many years, I had always felt that the Service Department had integrity.  While Mike Powell was a Service Advisor and then Manager, he always made me feel that whatever service being recommended was actually needed and the service was completed accurately and professionally.  Ever since he left, I never felt the same.  Now when I bring my car in for service, I feel as though I am being recommended service that isn't needed and have to question everything.  My last service on April 22-23, 2015 proved my fears.  I brought my car in for an oil change.  After waiting approx. 2 hours, the Service Advisor, Amanda Robinson, greets me with a list of ""require immediate attention"" service items totaling $912 plus a warranty issue that needed to be fixed.  These services included: Brake Flush, Manual Transmission Fluid Change, Battery Replacement, Fuel Injection Cleaning Service, Water Pump, and  the usual cabin and engine air filters. After the shock wore off, I made the appointment the next day for the warranted water pump service and told her I would let her know about the other items.  I went home and reviewed my previous service records and to my dismay, I determined that I just had my brakes flushed at the last service and it had only been 10,000 miles since that service was performed.  The cabin and air filters had also been replaced previously.   When I brought the brake flush service to Amanda's attention she was surprised and admitted that she did not review my service history.  As a result of that admission, I questioned the validity of the other recommended services such as the transmission fluid change.  I asked her what should the oil look like to determine if it is dirty.  She didn't know.  She called up the mechanic that had worked on my car and he said purple but couldn't show it to me because it had to be raised in a stall.  Since my car required warranty service, it had to be sent to the main service area for Pat Schulps, Master Technician to oversee.  Amanda had me brought over to that location to speak with Pat about the service issues.  They had the car up in the stall and the technician showed me the transmission oil and yes, it did appear dirty since the color of transmission oil is actually like a clear gold not the purple that the original mechanic stated.  So that service appeared to be needed, even though the original mechanic and the service advisor had no idea what the oil was suppose to look like.  I then proceeded to ask Pat about the other items.  Looking at the air filters they were only slightly dirty and could easily be cleaned by an air compressor. On the battery, there was a little bit of acid corrosion.  The technician cleaned it and retested the battery.  The result was:  Good & Pass; state of health 94% & state of charge 100%.  The test printout from the previous day showed Bad & Replace with a 62% & 71%. Finding that to be odd, I reviewed and compared both printouts and noticed that the ""bad"" test had a test date on 4/7/2002 on it with different volts and ratings on it.  So either the first test was performed on an outdated machine or they have some old printouts that they use to ""trick"" the customer???  Needless to say, I don't need a new battery.  Pat did mentioned to keep an eye on the battery if the corrosion occurs again.  The fuel injection service was not necessary as well.

This service was the worst.  I waited 2 weeks to write this review hoping to calm down from the experience.  I am amazed that DCH Toyota, Simi Valley would hire and retain service advisors that have no mechanical knowledge and mechanics that just want to check the box.  I have spoken to other people who have had similar issues with the service department.  While I give the service department an ""F"", I do want to thank Pat Schulps for his willingness to go over my service issues and handle them personally.  He may be the only ""good one"" left. Just by reviewing previous reviews on this site you can see that when Mike Powell left the 5 star review diminished.  That should be a red flag for top management!!!!",1.0

204,"February 12, 2015","Thanks to Brian Lamb, my husband and I had an easy, honest, and enjoyable car-buying experience. Before contacting Brian, we visited and communicated with several other Toyota dealerships. Each time, we met the usual run-around sales tactics and could not get a straight answer to any of our questions or a bottom line price on the Toyota Highlander that we wanted. We were exhausted and frankly were about to give up on purchasing a new car at all. That feeling quickly changed as soon as we contacted Brian Lamb at DCH Toyota of Simi Valley. From his first communication with us, we knew that he was different. He immediately gave us a bottom line price on the car we wanted, and the price was fair and competitive according to our research! He continued to impress us with how easy he made the whole transaction and how hard he worked to locate the exact car we wanted. My husband and I were pleasantly surprised by his honest and straight-forward nature. No games, no sales tactics. .Brian Lamb has an inherent sense of integrity that is rare.

205,"January 25, 2015","I've been involved in over a dozen vehicle transactions - New & Preowned.  From Dealerships that claim they are the best in radio/tv/print to small independent lots.  Never have I been so impressed with a Dealer, but Brian Lamb of DCH Toyota Simi Valley earned my respect from the get go.  I visited and contacted about 10 dealerships in a 200 mile radius to find this specific model SUV.  From my experience, I'm very skeptical and guarded.  Brian picked up on it, but was always very friendly, respectful, never pushy and answered all of my questions.  I travel very frequently and so the transaction duration from first contact took over a month.  Many other Dealers would be put off or could have ignored my sporadic inquires.  But each time, Brian would chat as if we spoke an hour earlier.  My family and I had a hectic schedule so we arranged an appointment for paperwork and sign off to be done quickly.  There were no surprises when we arrived - the vehicle was in detail, we filled out the paperwork, got the TFS credit approved, through Finance without any pressure and into the vehicle for the tutorial.

206,"January 19, 2015","This is a review of the parts department.  I purchased my 2014 Toyota Avalon in November.  Costco offers a 50% coupon off parts and/or service up to $200 for going through them.  When I attempted to use this coupon in December to purchase illuminated door sills I was refused.   I was told by the parts manager they since they are running a 20% off parts I could not use the coupon (although the coupon clearly states you simply cannot COMBINE discounts).  I was told to return in January.  Today I went in again.  The 20% sign was still up and I imagine it is always there.  Again there was a lot of time spent verifying the coupon.  After checking with a manager I was then told the price of the part had gone up and they would ONLY charge me $200.00.  That, of course, would mean this item retails for $400.00.  I questioned them but in the end decided to purchase the item.  Then I was directed to the service department to get a price for installation.  After someone chasing after about five different people I was quoted $390.00 for installation only.  REALLY!!!   After leaving I quickly called Thousand Oaks Toyota.  They quoted the part at $299.00 which I later determined is the retail price for this item.  They also quoted me $125.00 for install.  Let's see ... that is $175.00 LESS than DCH quoted me with my coupon.  This is nothing more than a scam and a rip off.  I returned to DCH, cancelled my order and got a refund.  I advised them to never go into their lunch room and start complaining about government dishonesty and being ripped off because DCH contributes to the same culture that creates angry, disgruntled citizens by their dishonesty.  I came home.  Purchased the part on line for $245.00 with shipping and will have a body shop install it.  I don't care if I paid more because I would never give DCH the satisfaction of getting any money from me in this manner.
Recommendation.  yeah...don't buy parts from DCH.  Shop around, dealers, body shops, on line, anywhere but DCH.  And if this is indicative of the dealership I guess you need to be very careful of your purchases and service as well.  Such a shame that people continue to make decisions to work for dishonest companies thinking saying I'm sorry covers it all.  Uh huh, sorry you got nailed no doubt.  Things will never change until people stand up and refuse to accept it or perpetuate dishonesty.",2.8

Although DCH Toyota was the furthest dealership we were working with, with over a 2 hour drive, Brian's professionalism and honesty made us feel like it would be worth it to make the trip.

We weren't disappointed.  Brian had everything set up for us.  There were no surprises.  He made us feel like we were real people that mattered to him, not just some number on the monthly commission report.  In fact, everyone at the dealership was great.

Richardo Salazar demeanor was very professional. We would definitely recommend him as well! No pressure, and no bad dealer tactics here.

I have high standards as in my honest opinion, a customer should be. There have been many times post-sale that I had questions, and have requested support as well as concerns with the vehicle, Andy has welcomed me to contact him on his cell with any ""questions or concerns"" on his ""hotline"". I did take advantage and he has been easy to get a hold of and has addressed my concerns every time, and has supported me after the sale and listened to me whenever I requested.

After my purchase, I had an issue resolved with my alignment, my freon was topped off, and a belt was also replaced. Duke Arnone was AWESOME to work with!

246,"August 26, 2013","My sister and I stopped by DCH Toyota to look for a used car for our mother. We were just going to get ideas to present to her. Andy was the sales person who helped us. He was extremely knowledgeable and helpful. We spent a number of hours looking at cars and test driving them. He let us drive two cars up to our mom's house so she could look at them. We did not want her to be burdened by making hard decisions or being overwhelmed in the car buying process. Andy could not have made our decision to buy a new Corolla Special Edition any easier. He went above and beyond what I expected from a salesperson. We were able to take care of all of the paperwork at the dealership and the next day (Andy's day off) he came in to work drove the new car up to my moms house. All the paperwork was prepared so all she needed to do was sign on the highlighted areas, in the comfort of her home. He them thoroughly went over the new car with her so she was familiar with it and them drove her old car away!  WHAT INCREDIBLE SERVICE!!!!!  I never expected the process to be so easy for her and for us. I am amazed at this level of customer service and have told everyone I know how great it was. Andy was a true professional and took the stress of buying a car away and made it a very pleasurable experience. I am happy to know that in the future my mom will be able to deal with this dealership for all her future needs. ",5.0

Andy Sasso also helped me out in picking the Prius and informed me of all the features during the test drive. He has a very welcoming attitude and you feel at ease talking deals and purchasing a car from him. 10/10

Ricardo Salazar was the finance manager whom I spoke to after the car was purchased.

When I informed Amanda that I called and got approval for the coupon by PATTY she said that there is nothing she can do. I was there and in order to salvage the rest of the day I reluctantly agreed to their higher price. After three hours to do simple oil change I got my car and drove off. Then I noticed my car was leaking oil. I took it back and waited another 2 hours for the problem. They said the oil pan nut was not put on correctly and they wanted $300 to change it out!

290,"May 05, 2013","Without Nick, Simi Valley Toyota would have lost me as a customer.  I had an issue with my seat belt latch,  Not a big problem, but after Amanda handled it-- the mole hill turned into a federal case.  I first noticed a problem 4 weeks ago, and I called right away and Amanda set up an appointment to have it checked.  Of course, the seat belt worked fine for the mechanic. I was told they could do nothing and to bring it back when it happened again, so the next day when it happened again, I brought it in --the service department was closed, but lucky for me Angel was able to see the issue. And so I had to make appointment 2--3rd visit.  The teck confirmed the problem, and since no one ordered the part, just in case- I had to make another appointment to install it.  This makes visit 4-same issue-to install-- And as it goes, someone either ordered or someone sent the wrong part.  So near the end of the day, Amanda called and said I have good news and bad news,  Now Amanda had the car for 4 hours-(quoted 2 hours)-I was under the understanding since this was the 4th time here--they were going to jump on it straight away. I was wrong, I did have an oil change done this day, and when Amanda said they had the wrong part-I suggested that at least i could get an oil change for my trouble.  Amanda said she would see what she could do for me.  I picked up my car and Amanda said she got a discount approved. $10.00 for 4 days.  Since she said she got the $10.00 approved, I felt I needed to speak with a higher manager than the service manager.  Lucky, I went into the show room--where I bought my car.  I spoke with Nick--He made the customer service difference.  (If we don't take care of the customer--someone else will!).  I wanted to let the corporation know how one employee makes a difference. Nick took care of my oil change charge, but more important is that he cared about how I was treated- and he wanted me to leave with a positive experience.  Thanks-Nick.

300,"March 11, 2013","We had a great experience buying a Prius C at DCH this weekend. In fact, it was the best car-buying experience we have ever had (we are both in our mid '70s so that is a lot of experience). Cesar Garcia was our sales rep. 

We were unsure that the car would be what we really wanted, so he (they) let us take the ""unwind"" car for an extended test drive (it already had about 300 miles on it from a short-time owner whose credit had fallen through). Then we went home to do some research that evening. We wanted to check on whether the price was really a good deal (it was) and whether getting a 2012 with all of the ""bells and whistles"" would be better than getting a 2013 with fewer features (it was). So we went back yesterday and bought it!

We had also researched extended warranties and found we could get a better deal through an insurance policy, so we declined the policy they were offering. We declined a few other options, but did opt for the interior/exterior surface protection (sort of like Scotch Guard for the whole car). We want to keep it looking nice!

After the paperwork was done, Cesar helped us sync my phone to the bluetooth system and showed us a lot of the features. He also told us it would probably take a while to learn how to use everything and to come back whenever we needed and he would help us learn to use them. It is sort of like driving a powerful computer!

I began my online search on/about 1/18/13. I am not new to the game, and had been leasing for many years with another brand of car. I asked for quotes through Edmunds.com as well as directly through dealer websites. 

I knew the exact car I wanted, and was determined to have a dealer meet my terms. I visited one dealer in the San Fernando Valley in person (mistake!), and talked with a few others via phone and email. I was RELIEVED when I was contacted by Michael Dowl at DCH Toyota of Simi Valley. Not only did he tell me up-front which terms he knew he could meet, he promised me he would get back to me to confirm the remaining terms of the deal I wanted. There were no games, no broken promises, no bait & switch tactics. What a refreshing experience. 

DCH Toyota of Simi Valley met all of my terms in the most professional & friendly manner. I felt that I was treated as a customer should be treated. I want to especially recognize Michael Dowl. He is an asset to this organization, and a true professional. Ricardo Salazar was also very easy to work with, and explained all the financing very well. Everything that Michael & I had agreed upon for my lease, appeared on the paperwork by the time I met with Ricardo; again, no tricks or games. I also had the pleasure of meeting Doug Holzkamp when I went to the dealership on 1/24/13 to sign the paperwork, and again when I picked up my car.  

Overall I couldn't be happier with my experience at DCH Toyota of Simi Valley. I have already recommended this dealership to a family member and to a friend. I would NOT go anywhere else for my future vehicles. I guarantee they will work with you in a fair and ethical manner. Stop searching around and just call Michael Dowl at DCH Toyota of Simi Valley. 

Signed,

308,"January 25, 2013",Once again this dealership stepped up to the plate and went out of it's way to assist me in receiving a discount from Toyota Headquarters that had expired.  They never said that it could not be accomplished.  They called headquarters and were able to reinstate the discount for both cars that were leased.  It shows that this company will always keep the customer first in satisfaction.,5.0

   I just want to let you know what a great experiance I had with Bobby Gutierrez. Wow! He was so patient, honest, and knowledgeable.He was able to get the dealer to allow us to buy the car and then hold it for about a month so we could wait and present the car on Christmas day.Every other Dealer we went to would not work with us this way. Bobby also came in on his day off(Christmas Eve)to help us take delivery of our new car. I will not hesitate when it comes to recommending Bobby and DCH Dealers to my Friends and Family.Thanks for everything Bobby and DCH.

315,"January 02, 2013","I bought a used Toyota Corolla from this dealer.  Andy Sasso was the sales person who helped me with this purchase.  Andy was very friendly and helpful.  He tried to get the best price for me and very patient when I had to go back and forth comparing price with other dealers.

The only problem I had was the dealer forgot to put the registration sticker on the car.  But then I called the dealer and they took care of it immediately. 

Overall, I am very satisfied with this purchase.",4.8

The salesman we worked with, Jay Z, was very patient, understanding, and kind. This dealership had the best prices on cars. Everyone was ready to not only hear but actually listen to the customers. Had a great experience and recommended this dealership to other family members and friends. Also told them to ask for Jay Z. He really puts the customer first and really goes out of his way to help.

320,"December 25, 2012","Dennis stopped out and helped me right away. He listened to my needs and brought me to the cars I was describing. This was much better than the treatment I received from other dealerships. He even told me about a great advertised deal on a car I was interested in and I then was more enthusiastic about getting a new car and right away. I was lucky on the day I went in I guess. The only small things I had a problem with was some of the pricing beyond the vehicle itself. The protection package, which is only the edge covers for the doors costed $499 plus tax and the MSRP online is $109 (that's quite a large difference). And then there is the security etching package that is $299 plus tax. Both these things are not optional and are way over priced. Besides these two pricing annoyances, I believe the overall experience was good even though the purchasing processing took longer than it should have. I hope other services are more competitively priced.",4.6

328,"December 17, 2012","We had made a decision to purchase a Toyota Prius III, however couldn't decide if we should get the solar roof package (since it costs more). We went to the dealership with open mind in regards to the solar package. Dean, greeted us and as soon as we started talking to him we realized he is different and was willing to work with us on every front. He was extremely friendly, easy to talk to and work with. We had visited couple other dealerships before, but did not have a good experience. Dean was not willing to match competitors offer but even offering better prices than rest of them. Dean offered us a price for prius III with the solar roof and other incentives that was close to prius III (without solar package & incentives). The dealership offered the 0% APR without any hassles either.  The dealership offered extended warranty that was very reasonable as well. 
Overall we were extremely satisfied with our experience ( customer service, price, incentives, professionalism). I would definitely recommended DCH toyota of Simi Valley.",5.0

I had to call multiple numbers to get a hold of someone who could even look for my car and tell me that i could pick it up. I find out that the service center is closed on sundays which means i would have never received a call until monday morning that i could pick up my car. When i arrived at the dealership I overheard another person on the phone with the receptionist that had the exact same problem. One of the sales associates brought me my paperwork and keys, without even checking any form of identification. I wanted to speak to a manager but all were gone. They told me to call back on sunday and told me that someone would be in to handle the situation.

335,"December 08, 2012","We expected the worst; buying a car is often a horrible experience. As it turned out our experience was unusually positive. The salesman, Ceasar Garcia, followed up with us on the phone and quoted us a terrific price on a new car. (We had done a lot of research.)

When we arrived there was no haggling, no bait and switch, nothing negative whatever. Instead Ceasar was refreshingly forthright and honest and actually explained why the price was low. (Basically we lucked out.)

Nobody tried to make us buy anything extra. There was no pressure whatever. There was no haggling. There was no, ""Wait here and I'll talk to my sales manager."" It was like going into Costco, choosing an item, and knowing you paid a low and very fair price.

They prepped and detailed the car quicky and put in a full tank of gas.

Frankly we were amazed. Even when buying a Mercedes we had not experienced such a straightfoward and pleasant situation. We previously had known nothing of the dealer (another dealer is much closer to our home) but certainly would recommend DCH to anyone.",5.0

And with a polite and pleasant disposition, we never felt pressured, they should train everyone to be this way. He was on top of things, worked fast and precisely, this purchase was for our 19yr old son, we are on a tight budget. Angel Ascencio worked with Jay-Z to give us the best available options for lease, and accomodated us with a budget friendly monthly payment, we were very greatful for this.

My buying experience was FANTASTIC, hassle fee, and easy. I got the car at the price I wanted and got better trade-in value for my Venza than Northridge Toyota dealership offered to me.

357,"November 01, 2012","I had been putting off having to go to ANY car dealership because I really HATE the pressure and the games that sales people play. However, I couldn't have been happier with the way I was treated here! When I walked up, I wasn't attacked by the usual pack of wolves. Instead, I was met by a super friendly and unobtrusive gentleman named Cesar Garcia. He simply gave me the info I was asking about and a little more. Showed me that cars I wanted to see. Took me on a few test drives. Helped me weigh a couple of decisions about EVs without doing the obvious push to sell me something he wanted to unload. He made it clear to me that he only wanted to be of assistance and that only my complete satisfaction would do. I am in the process of selecting my vehicle this week so...there will be more to add.

Everything was just as Dean said it would be and as he sent  to us over the internet or via fax. We test drove the Tacoma and loved it and he spent at least an hour telling us about the vehicle and how to do the Navigation and misc other electronics and the overall features and benefits of the vehicle.

People were not running around with shaved heads and tatoos. The bathrooms were clean and tidy. The Finance person told us about the different programs and warranties and made suggestions as to the programs.

379,"October 02, 2012","We were very pleased with our experience at Toyota of Simi Valley, most especially with our salesman, Mike Harris.  Having been almost exclusively satisfied Toyota owners for more than 30 years, the last time we purchased a car (in 2004) we quite naturally immediately headed for the Toyota dealerships.  Unfortunately, we became so turned off by the salespeople at two other places, we ended up disgusted and purchased a Honda instead.  

We found out soon enough that all the propoganda about Hondas being as good as Toyotas did not apply to the one we bought, and we had many problems with that car.  We swore ourselves back into the ""Toyotas Only"" club, and when we set out to purchase our new car today, the only question was ""Where do we go?""  

Had we known about Toyota of Simi Valley back in 2004 and given them a chance before buying a Honda, perhaps we would not have been so eager to trade it in this ""soon"" (our 1998 Rav 4 has 260,000 miles on it and is still going strong.  We are in no hurry to part with it.)  We were greeted by Mike Harris, who was the shining star of our experience.  His pleasant, easy going personality relaxed us immediately, and his enthusiasm and knowledge of the cars was both impressive and reassuring.  It is astounding to us how many people know so little about the products they sell, but not so with Mike. Though we were already pretty set on purchasing a Prius, when we began to question Mike about the Camry he seemed to be just as ready and able to answer any question we might have had about that model as well.  After just a brief time with Mike, our dread of the ""New Car Purchase Experience"" left us, and both my husband and I felt confident that this would be the dealer from which we would purchase our new car.  While we had come prepared with the addresses of three other Toyota dealerships we anticipated needing to compare, it was, without question, Mike's manner and professionalism that was fully responsible for our realizing early on there was no need for us to go elsewhere.  

Ricardo, who did our financing, was also very pleasant, knowledgeable and efficient.  We expected a long day of exasperation, and were not the least bit disappointed to instead end up spending a pleasant afternoon with courteous, friendly, and professional people, finally driving off in the exact car we wanted.

Thanks to all at Toyota of Simi Valley.  We are hopeful we have finally found our lifelong dealership.

Sincerely, 

Connie and Ed Gombert ",5.0

384,"September 29, 2012","My wife and I were shopping to replace her 2001 Honda CRV. We came in to look at Prius' both used and new. Michael Jones (MJ), our salesman showed us the new ones and a used one. MJ answered all our questions about the vehicles as he explained the features of both cars. He was very knowledgeable about each car. MJ did not pressure us about taking a test drive or going in to talk pricing, or which Prius we wanted to purchase. We decided to test drive the used 2010 Prius IV, which my wife did. My wife liked how it drove and MJ explained how the various features of the car worked. Well, after the test drive we had a decision to make, was this the car for us? We asked MJ to excuse us as we wanted to discuss our feelings about purchasing this Prius, it was a 2010 Prius IV, Toyota Certified, with about 25k miles. MJ understood and let us go to discuss the car. We decided to purchase the car and went inside to price the car. MJ never pressured us during this whole process, we had expended at least an hour so far. MJ was very low key, which we appreciated very much, this immensely added to our total experience of purchasing the car. We settled on the deal, which MJ guided us through. MJ was wonderful to deal with, a very nice gentleman. Without his demeanor and patience, we probably would not have purchased the car. The whole ordeal with Michael took about 2 hours, he never once made us feel like we were not making the right decision. Michael SOLD THE WHOLE DEAL FOR US, he is a great salesman without being pushy or inpatient. Once we settled the deal, we met with Gus Herrera, to do the financing, registration, and warranty paperwork. Gus was great also and quite personable. He explained our warranty options in detail, including the advantages of adding a car alarm to the purchase, which we did. We also purchased an extended warranty. Both Michael and Gus are without a doubt very valuable assets to this dealer ship, DCH Toyota of Simi Valley. We will be recommending DCH to anyone looking for a Toyota, especially recommending Michael to be their salesman.  ",5.0

We live in Santa Barbara CA, so our first stop was our local Toyota dealership.  What a mistake!  We faced a barrage high pressure sales tactics and constantly changing prices.  They never honored any price that they had told us on previous occasions.  So, we decided to research other dealerships on the central coast and in southern CA.  

By a stroke of luck, we happened to call Jeff Johnson at DCH Toyota of Simi Valley.  He immediately located the exact cars we wanted: model, package, and colors.  The only catch?  They were 2013's instead of 2012's, and the price was cheaper than any offer we had heard!  So we drove down to DCH Toyota of Simi Valley and met with Jeff.  Jeff treated us with respect, he never engaged in high pressure sales tactics, and he stayed true to the original price quote.  One week later, and we now have our new Corollas.  We are more than satisfied with the shopping experience with Jeff at DCH.

Thanks, Jeff!  You're an honorable and decent salesman; something sorely lacking at most dealerships.",5.0

396,"September 08, 2012","Took car in for oil change and tire rotation on my van.  Was called and told there was a recall on the rear gate lift system that needed to be performed.  This rear gate has never malfunctioned in the 7 years I've owned the van.  Now rear hatch won't close at all and I was left stranded at VONS with groceries in the van and the rear hatch unable to close.  I requested to have the car fixed at another Toyota dealership due to previous issues by this dealership, such as them selling me and installing the wrong sized tires on my car that wore out in a year and they admitted they sold me the wrong tires.  Not enough room here to list all the issues we've had with this dealership over the past 7 years. The Service Manager has informed me that he can not help me accomplish getting repairs done at Thousand Oaks Toyota and I have to make all the phone calls myself.  I never wanted to be an employee of Toyota, but I am sure having to put in hours of my own time getting my van repaired after they installed struts that are not supported by the motor. I was informed by Simi Valley Toyota Customer Service person named Crystal that this has happened to at least 9 of the vans on this recall at the Simi Valley Dealership. Why I had to hear that from her and not the service manager is because the service manager said he was unaware of this.  It is his job to be aware of this information.  He also would not guarantee the work on my van if I brought it back to them, stating, ""Anything can happen"" when I asked him what if I bring my van back to you and more things go wrong?  Not what a customer needs to hear. A customer needs to hear, ""I am so sorry that this has happened to your van.  It has happened before with this recall and we know how to fix it.  We will have your van back to you in a timely manner and have full confidence that we can fix the problem that was created when we did the recall.""  Greg did not have his facts straight when he said to me that I had called to have the recall performed.  All he had to do was check what I wrote on my night drop box envelope for type of service to be performed. It stated, ""Oil Change and Tire Rotation.""  We were never notified of a recall prior to bringing the van in for the aforementioned service and certainly did not request it.  When I tried explaining this to the service manager, he started harrassing me, and telling me that I must be a very unhappy person who always needs to be right to keep going on like this.  Well Greg, when you don't have your facts straight, and keep talking over me, I am going to keep telling you what the facts are and if you can't handle the truth then I need to speak to your boss. When I asked for the name of Greg's boss, he told me that it is a corporation and I'd have to look it up!  He then started rambling some very unpleasant, harrassing statements that I do not wish to post here and I told him I was done with him and would be hanging up. Stay away from this dealership.  They are not helpful and they blame the customer.  ",1.3

He actually ended up climbing a ladder, taking the cover off of my garage door opener so he could find the button that needed to be pressed to pair the car and the opener, and then put the cover back on!

There is one more person I would like to mention, but I do not remember his name.  I was looking at Prius's in the lot on my first visit.  He told me he was the internet sales manager.  It turns out that I had just emailed him a few hours before and I told him so.  We went inside, he found my email and talked to me about what I was looking for.  I told him that I was not buying for a few weeks because I was in the middle of refinancing my house.  He was very understanding.

However, I kept thinking about that white Prius and Prius V and suddenly saw them everywhere I went. And I fell in love.

But that isn't what we ended up buying on Friday and Saturday. Meantime, my son had wrecked his car, a Toyota Corolla. So, I emailed Skyler and we came out shopping for a Toyota Corolla. My son gave a Prius a drive but ultimately, thanks to Skyler's gentle and thoroughly informed manner, we bought a  terrific 2010 Toyota Corolla at a great price.

I look forward to seeing Skyler again and buying a Pruis from him. Of all the salesmen we saw as we looked at various types of cars for my son, none were as capable and friendly as Skyler who went the extra 10 miles. I suspect he is one of your best salesmen.

I came to service my 2010 Toyota Camry SE and left with a new 2012 Camry SE. To my delight, I was introduced to Andrew who immediately bonded with me as I explored the lot. Within a short period, he offered some options that made sense to trade up. All this without the pressure and anxiety usually associated with investing in a new vehicle. Andy Sasso was Andrew's support and both of these staff should be cloned. Thank you for a wonderful experience. I look forward to seeing them again when I come back for my future services.

440,"July 19, 2012","This was my first car I've ever puchased. So let's just say I was thrown into the fire with regards to sales and negotiations.

Cesar was a the BEST help. I was unable to actually purchase the car from Cesar (I closed the deal with Dennis who was also great) but he was still EXTREMELY helpful even when he knew I was not going to purchase the car at that time and still going to shop around.  He was able to assist me when the Thousand Oaks Toyota dealership was rude and completely unhelpful.

Dennis was awesome too. He was not too pushy and was able to answer all of my questions.

Overall I had a great experience with DCH Toyota Simi Valley & I hope to continue the relationship with them.",4.8
441,"July 19, 2012","We purchased a new Prius using the Costco buyers referral program.  Michael Dowl clearly explained the process and reviewed the dealer's invoice and Costco program savings to us.  He was completely reassuring, plain-spoken which allowed us to shop with confidence.  Jason Schuyler showed us many choices, clearly differentiated our options and concluded the terms of our sale and trade-in. He was patient, able to answer all of our questions and was forth-right in negotiating with us.  He was especially informed about the many digital features of the Prius bluetooth, apps, audio systems, taking time late in the day to orient us to the Prius.  Bijan Rahimi made the final contract and financing arrangements for us.  He was speedy and on top of the process, making this drudgery less loathsome...we are most grateful.  At Toyota of Simi Valley we found many choices, a friendly patient staff, and fair pricing with immediate delivery...a great buying experience for us.",5.0

I had to beg them for a status update several times.  I had too actually go by the shop multiple times for a status, two days after no communication from the service department.  Very poor communication and broken promises to call with a status.  The day the car was supposed to be ready, I called several times and finally reached a service person who told me my car was ready and no additional services was required.  When I got home I reviewed the paperwork in detail with indicated that I need brake service, dirty air filter and a tire rotation.  I thus call and was told to bring the car back for couple of more days.  Really, like the hundreds of dollars in car rental fees were not enough.  This is the same Toyota dealership; I have been going to for two decades.  Up til now I have always had exceptional service.  To be fair it has been a couple years.

444,"July 15, 2012","We were in the market for an affordable new sedan for my 17 year old daughters first vehicle.  Costco Auto Buying program referred us to Miller Toyota, Culver City, which is 30 miles from our home, and we had an appt set up with a rep at 2pm yesterday.  Our first stop was William L Morris Chevrolet to test drive the Chevy Cruze and Malibu.  Jeff Morris was very concerned about my daughters satisfaction with her first car and the fact that we would have to leave in the mid day heat from Simi Valley to Culver City Toyota, when I stated that he had a very good relationship with Nick Dulea, general manager across the street at DCH Toyota of Simi Valley, and that, if we wish, would make a phone call and have Nick and his team take care of us.  We agreed to do this at least to see and test drive the Camry and possibly avoid the hassle of driving to Culver City to find the same car.  Jeff Morris made the phone call; and we were greeted at DCH Toyota of Simi Valley by general manager, Nick Dulea and rep Tony Fierro, with smiles and handshakes making us feel right at home.  After describing basically what my daughter was looking for, Tony swiftly escorted outside to the lot to look for the camry SE 4 dr White exterior with Black Leather interior minus moonroof and navigation. Nick from the very moment we arrived assured us with confidence that the price and auto would meet or exceed our expectations....and he was correct.  Once we narrowed down the specific features of the auto; Nick dealer located the exact vehicle at Northridge Toyota; dealer traded the vehicle in the 1 hour timeframe it took us to have lunch and return to dealership.  After lunch, Tony returned with the car; had us inspect to make sure it was indeed the exact auto we desired with all included features, meanwhile Nick kept showing us the features and made double and triple sure all features were just as we desired so that he could meet our needs of finding the exact car with the exact features Nikki desired.  After verification that the dealer traded Camry was exactly as we desired, the car was sent for detailing and we proceeded with the paperwork process and financial.  All the team members were VERY kind and compassionate and congratulatory at every step.  Overall, the entire customer experience, which lasted a total of 4 hours, was worth the time effort and persistence and easily among the best we have had (10/10).  Nick assured a better than Costco price, delivered on his promise, made us feel at ease without pressure or coercion, and due to the huge savings, we were able to afford some essentials, like LoJack System, Door Guard safety package, protective 3M rear window tint package, AND most importantly, 7 year 75 Mile extended Platinum Care Coverage. One of the salient selling features of this car was the 10 airbag and 5 star safety rating as well as many many years of customer loyalty record sales and the fact that we were recent purchasers of a 2011 Toyota Sienna Minivan.  Cheers to DCH Simi Valley Toyota - Nick D, gen mgr, and his entire support team, for making my daughters FIRST auto experience painless and extraordinary.  God Bless DCH, and all the future and past happy purchasers as well as Jeff Morris at William L Morris Chevrolet for thinking beyond the almighty ""sale"" to truly satisfy the customer !!!",5.0

Mr. Brett Fick made the leasing experience as simple as possible offering full explanations every step of the way. Our tade in was priced fair and above market value and the new vehicle was discounted below what othewr dealers were quoting for even LESS equipment than the Highlander we chose at DCH. This transaction was our second at DCH and most certainly not our last. I HIGHLY recmmend the entire dealership to anyone who wants a new or used vehicle at a fair price.

452,"July 02, 2012","Got the best price when they had their 4th of July sale.
I was negotiating online and Gus was one of the rare guys that actually sent me the spec sheet of the car that I was going to buy. That itself got me to trust him a little more than all the other guys.
Several of the other dealers (ESPECIALLY Oxnard DCH Toyota - don't waste your time with those bozos) totally try and keep you in the dark and feed you crap to try and get you come down to the dealership so they can scam you there. But this wasn't the case with him. Initially his FINAL price wasn't the best, but they happened to put the car that I was interested in on sale for 4th of July and so I got a price that couldn't be beat.
And when I got there, there was no pressure at all to add more crap. I got what I went there for and did not get anything extra while not getting charged for VIN number etching and door treatment and all the other nonsense that other dealers try and add on hoping that you don't read the bill carefully enough.

453,"July 02, 2012","I'll be the first to give Mr. Carpenter a review.  Took my 2010 Tundra in for a faulty windshield moulding, this caused that annoying ticking sound while doing highway speeds.  Dropped it off in the morning and picked it up in the afternoon.  I was hoping he would initially replace the part but instead they had the moulding sealed.  However, Mike said if if pops back up to give him a call and they'll replace it.   Anyway, a few weeks go buy and noticed the moulding started to warp .. so I figured to give Mike a call.  Plus, there was also an issue with the truck engaging while I was at a full stop.  It felt like being bumped in the back so decided to have them take a look at it along with the moulding. Dropped it off in the morning and I received a call from Mike providing me with a detailed list of what he intends to do withthe truck.  Unfortunately, they didn't have the part so they had to special order it.  They kept the truck for a day and picked it up late eveining.  The moulding was replaced and a new drive shaft was installed.  Thanks for keeping your word and not trying to ""jerry-rig"" the moulding.  Now, I knew about the driveshaft before I went to the dealership--I knew there was an existing TSB available and wanted to see if these guys would bring it up.  To my surprise-- they did.  He mentioned during the assessment that there was a TSB for the problem I mentioned about the bumping feeling when the truck is stopped.  I'm surprised because I've owned several Toyotas from the first gen Tundra's to the first gen 4Runners, and I've taken these vehicles to other dealerships and never got the service I received from DCH.  I know my Toyota's and I know when a good service advisor is honest.  The last honest service advisor I had was in Van Nuys several years ago-- this guy went above and beyond when I had my 2002 Tundra supercharged.  On another note, when I left the truck for service that day, I mentioned to my wife I left 25.00 in cash in the center console and some change in the dispenser.  This was after the fact so if it was taken then I wouldn't have an argument to stand on --when I picked up the truck low and behold money and change was still there.  That was an outstanding feeling.  Reassurance and honesty from a dealership--- who would've thunk. Thanks Mike and the Service team--looking forward to using your services in the future. ",4.8

At the dealership Gus was the same pleasant and straight forward person he was online. He worked diligently and quickly to finalize the purchase transaction. When he saw that my 2 young daughters were getting bored he went over to the overhead flat screen TV and put on the cartoon channel for them. Wow, that was remarkable.

Bijan Rahimi did a wonderful job of covering all of the different finance, warrantee and car options that were available for the Prius. He even offered my kids some treats to keep them happy while he covered all the aforementioned topics. He made sure we understood all the details by explaining them clearly and in addition, provided printed information with valuable information.

Upon actual delivery of the car to me, Gus sat in the car with me and my family to explain the operation of the Prius. He setup the electronics such as the pairing of my cell phone to the on board blue tooth. In addition, he set up other on board systems for me and covered all of the other important details of the new car making sure we understood it all.

499,"May 17, 2012","I had an appointment with Ceasar but, he wasn't there. Instead, my wife and I showed up and to my delight we dealed with Jason instead. I found him very honest and knowledgeable with the Toyota cars. He helps in getting what the customer wants and what they would need. He might say what is in the cars in regards to what it has, and regarding the Hybrids, what it takes to fix the cars, and how much it costs to fix the problems. He let us try a few cars and try to over rate the driving. He knows how to use other features that are different with the cars and our experiences. He makes it very comfortable for us to ask him questions even if it would seem not relevant. He takes it to a place to make it relevant and he gives back-ups to drive home any answers. He says that it might even be redundant to answer some questions since these are Toyotas and to compare the vehicle to another brand is not necessary since the other brands have no equvalent. I subscribe to Car and Driver magazine and I know that Jason's not lying. I really liked Jason, and felt really comfortable dealing with him with no stress of ""Gotta buy a car right NOW!!!"" kind of feeling.",5.0

Dennis did a great job of explaining all the features in the car and getting us set up to get on the road.  Ricardo in finance was also a pleasure to deal with.

I was willing to spend a little more money than I initially intended because I trusted that Mike was giving me an honest deal.  

Gus Herrera was very helpful and knowledgeable with the Prius technology.  Any question I could think of, Gus answered effectively and thoroughly.  He also displayed willingness to work hard for the (very) specific vision of car I had in my head.

Bijan Rahimi made the most painful part of purchasing a car enjoyable.  He lowered the prices of the extra care/maintenance packages when I wasn't comfortable with them.  He also made my wife and I feel comfortable by indicating interest in us as ""people"" and not just ""customers.""

I had an excellent experience overall and I will go immediately to Simi Valley Toyota next time I""m in the market for a Toyota.

Additionally, he did what he promised to do relative to helping me with my lease of a new Prius.
Then I was ""blown away"" when Dennis Piechowski offered to drive the car to my house to show it to me. Dennis also did what is promised and went out of his way to come to my home twice in one hour. Dennis exemplifies what i thought was a lost art; ""CUSTOMER SERVICE"". I would highly recommend both Dennis and Michael to anyone in the market for a Toyota.

597,"March 10, 2012","My wife and I could not be more please with DCH Toyota of Simi Valley. A little background on our situation: my wife was in an accident which necessitated getting another car at a difficult time financially for us.  In the past I have leased a new Ford, financed a new Honda, a used Toyota and a used VW.  Unfortunately in the present our credit was such that we were not even sure if we could even be financed.  Because of this, prior to going to DCH we had spent the previous week jumping through hoops for a mid-town ""dealer"" that sold auction vehicles.  Learning as we went, we discovered after being told the car ""had clean title with no accidents"" and our credit run - a TWO accident history.  When we confronted the manager on this she lied saying a) I never said that and b) the car was just sold to someone else. Enter DCH's ad for a dream MDX priced UNDER market.  Too good to be true.  We called half thinking it would have been sold already.  Not true, Gus took our call and was willing to send us all sorts of documentation before even pressuring us to come over and see the car - totally interested in OUR concerns and not in his potential commission.  Now, making matters even more interesting for me, my wife has to work and says ""go on over honey I trust you.""  Geez, no pressure.  So, I go over and meet Gus.  By the way, when I called for Gus, the receptionist answering the phones was also totally professional and helpful - like I was the most important call of the day.  Back to Gus.  First thing without even asking, he shows me the Carfax.  We took a test drive, made a list of items I wanted addressed.  Gus explained that Nick his GM trained him to focus on the customer's needs, that Nick sets the price fairly so there is no typical back and forth game I have experience at dealerships like a Baghdad rug market. I spoke with my wife and shared with her my thumbs up and got the ""I trust you honey.""  So, we did a credit app for Gus and came back that evening half thinking ""well it would be nice, but let's not get our hopes up too high as they probably have an A-List credit customer closing the deal in the other room and Gus is going to try and push us in a 1993 Corolla.  Not true, Gus met with us and let us know that they are happy to work with us, yes, there are some challenges, but we are no different than many of his customers.  He went over the numbers he got from their Finance Department and gave us a list of further documentation they needed to see.  We went home and got Gus the additional documentation and came in the next afternoon.  When we met with the Finance Manager, even his interest was in getting us the best rate possible and made a prideful point at how he was able to save us significant money.  I began to wonder if I walked into a reality movie set or something.  You hear about the Golden Rule in Sunday School ""but nobody in business practices that anymore.""  Not true.  There is a Santa Claus Virginia! Now here is the golden nugget as far as I am concerned:  After getting our money and signature, instead of treating us as an after thought, the levels of courtesy and service elevated to the next level in working through the list of items that needed handling on the car as a part of the deal - From Gus staying in touch to Juan ensuring all was being taken care of.  Nick himself took the time to meet me personally to assure me he would stand behind the deal to our full and complete satisfaction.  I cannot thank Nick and his team enough.  They made such an impression on my wife also that she holds them up as so special and rare that we will likely not find another dealer to come close when it's time for our next car.  And, oh by the way she LOVES her car!!

Very friendly and accurate service, the fact that the dealer made it a point to thoroughly inspect and issue a certification for the used car I wanted to buy was to me an indication of their commitment for quality and support not just for new cars but for any cars they sell.

I contacted total 4 dealerships, it became a competition between DCH Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks Toyota. After about 2 weeks of negotiation, DCH won my business.

I was helped by Dennis Piechowski and he was very helpful. The first time we spoke on the phone, he's not like regular sales persons who over acting and try to be your best friend. But when I met him, he's actually very friendly and very knowledgeable about Prius because he actually owned one. He helped me through all the buying process, went back and forward to the finance department to get me the best deal I wanted. The whole process took about 3-4 hrs, from test drive till I got the keys. He also picked me up him self, to get my Camry which was due for an oil change at the dealership.

I got a free bluetooth which was installed in the 2nd week after purchase, no problem with that. I was told the installation takes about 1-3hrs, it was actually completed in less than an hour. The Prius was also missing the hooks for the carpet floor mat for the driver seat, but Dennis took care of that, no complaints.

Compare to Hamer Toyota (where I bought my very first new car from, a Camry 2011), DCH is a winner in all aspects. Trust me, don't go to Hamer Toyota, they suck!",5.0

Even though it is far from my house we went because of the way Schuyler was on the telephone and the ad. they had in the newspaper. In the past I've always bought/leased from the Toyota dealership closest to my home. That morning we went to the other dealership planning on buying a car from them. We were treated so badly that I was almost ready to never buy a Toyota again. Now, because of the wonderful treatment we received from Jason Schuyler and the other people at the Simi Valley dealership I believe that I will continue to buy Toyota cars. (I intend to buy one for my other son in two years) They had the cars that were in their ad. , three or four different colors, and I qualified for all of the rebates except for the leaser rebate of $750. Everyone there was extremely friendly and made us feel at ease and welcomed. Jason answered all of our questions and answered questions we haven't even thought about but would have later. This was to be my son's first new car, a 21st birthday present. What started off as a bad experience at a nearby car dealership turned into a great experience because of Schuyler and the rest of the wonderful people at DCH Toyota. Throughout the experience several people came up and help with any questions that we might have had. By the time Jason Schuyler had given us a tour of the dealership and finished up explaining all the features of our new car, one of his managers came up to congratulate my son and gave him a few gifts for him to use for his car.

683,"January 06, 2012","This is the third vehicle we have purchased from this dealer, and the second car in as many years.  We specifically asked for Jason Borst because of his laid-back demeanor, lack of pushiness or opinions, and honesty.  He listens to what you want instead of trying to tell you what you want, then he gets you exactly what you asked for.  I hate being steered toward a different vehicle, color, etc. because it is convenient for the dealer or salesperson, and Jason never does these things, so he's our guy.
Scion has &quot;pure pricing&quot; so price was not an issue for us this time, but when we bought our Tacoma 4x4 last year it was, and Jason got us a GREAT price on the truck.  We went in with the price we had in mind, he delivered on it with a truck that had more features than we had priced out!  A month later our best friends bought the same truck at a different dealer and they did not get near the price we got.
When I went in to buy the iQ on the first of December, Jason was temporarily out, and Billy Lennox started the process of tracking down the car I wanted.  It was a lot of work for both of these men to call all over the place trying to find the car I wanted.  Jason finally found one at the dock in LA, on its way to the main Toyota plant.  They both kept after the guys at the plant to hurry and get the car done- it was Christmas, so people were on vacation.  They called the plant every day.  
When I picked up the car today they were both so tickled about it- it's my very first new car, and I could see how happy they were for me.  As a woman, I appreciate being treated in a professional manner, especially at a car dealership. I am very happy with my new car and with the hard work Jason did on my behalf.  ",5.0

688,"January 03, 2012","Dear Reader, Who likes the tension of visiting a dealership to buy a car? If there is pressure, tricky  sales tatics and dishonesty, no one does. But my experience with Marc Kolohe at DCH Toyota of Simi Valley was just the opposite. He was helpful beyond description. And the amazing thing is, I didn't buy that day. Still, it was clear that Marc was committed to my best interests, not just a sale. That's why I'm sold on him and the dealership. Serveral years ago I bought a Camry there. I was very satisfied then. But just because I didn't buy over this last week end, doesn't mean I won't be back. In fact, my experience with Marc makes it a certainty that I'll be returning to see him and pointing others to do the same. Way to go, Marc. And thank you, DCH Toyota of Simi Valley remains my first choice.  Warmly, Steve Brewer, Pastor of Simi EV Free Church",4.8
689,"January 02, 2012","The reason I put ""n/a"" on all the categories above is because I had two different experiences at DCH.  In a nutshell, my experiences with Skyler and Mark were all 5s, these men absolutely embody the idea of ""delivering customer happiness.""  If my DCH experience had been limited to interaction with Skyler and Marc it would have been absolutely the best car-buying experience of my life.  Unfortunately, I had to deal with Billy, for which the number 1 is entirely accurate.  I'm going to tell you exactly what Billy did to drive me away from your dealership and over to another Toyota dealer, but I'm going to begin with exactly why Skyler made me a customer and how Marc brought me back.  

First, when I called the dealership and they put me on the phone with Skyler, I told him my situation, which was that I had definitely decided on a Prius, I would be paying cash with an immaculate Mini in trade, and I needed him to show me the car and take me on a test drive.  I told him that I felt it important to give my business to whomever took the time to do this, but that my husband would make the final decision based on the deal offered.  I also told him I was not buying a car during that first visit, but that I would be buying a Prius before the end of the year.  Skyler assured me that he would do everything he could to earn my business, and even though at that point he asked for the sale directly, he did it in such a ""no pressure"" way (just very direct, but not pushy) that I felt very comfortable coming right over, which I did.  Skyler met me at the parking lot with the beautiful Blizzard Pearl Prius I asked him to have ready.  Skyler showed me all around the car and explained everything in a way a non-car person such as myself could understand.  We went on a test drive and by the end of it I had promised him I would come back the next day with the Mini so he could have it appraised.  Now this is important, as when I went in to DCH I had no intention of making any definite plans to do anything of the sort.  My plan was to go back home, talk to my husband that evening and possibly return to the dealership over the weekend.  I changed the plan because Skyler made me feel that he was on my side, he made me feel comfortable, and he made me feel that I was not in a typical car dealership where they look at a middle-aged woman customer the same way hyenas look at a wounded doe at the water hole.  

I came in the next day with my son, Ethan.  Again the plan had changed.  I felt so comfortable dealing with Skyler that instead of just coming in for an appraisal, my husband gave me the go-ahead to make the deal that afternoon!  I was so excited!  I was going to drive away that afternoon in my new car!  And then Billy stepped in.  Within the first two minutes of meeting him I was completely alienated.  When I explained that I wanted to make a deal, but that my husband had the last word, he stepped up to me and sneered, ""Oh, so YOU don't make the decisions.""  It was such a blatantly obvious attempt at intimidation (the getting in my personal space) and manipulation (trying to put me on the defensive) it irritated me more than anything else.  So I made a joke of it to try to lighten up the sudden tension and said, ""Well, that's how you stay married 30 years, you let your husband make those kinds of decisions.""  Instead of taking the olive branch I offered, the next thing he did was invite me to leave.  He said, ""Why don't you leave now and let your husband shop us and then come back when you're ready to make a deal.""  Now let's look at that statement.  He told a paying customer who was ready to buy a car that day, to leave?  And then there's the shopping part.  If I had been interested in shopping his price, why in the world would I come back if another dealer gave me a better deal in the first place?  

After that there was the usual back and forth, with Skyler going to talk to Billy and coming back.  After a couple of times Billy came in and sat down in Skyler's chair.  It was obvious he was going to ""school"" Skyler and show him how a real car salesman makes a sale.  He started to spin stories about how the dealership made no money, etc.  What he must have seen was that wounded doe and her little baby fawn, but what he got was my son, who is incredibly savvy with money and blessed with a brain like a computer when it comes to numbers, so whenever Billy would throw out some B.S. numbers Ethan would come right back at him with the actual math, which proved that Billy's B.S. was just that.  This made Billy angry.  And belligerent.  The fact that we could see him  getting angry and that he treated us in such a way as to make us feel disliked and unwelcome is not indicative of  the precepts posted on your wall; there was no ""pleasing and friendly spirit"" emanating from Billy.  Also, it's just not good salesmanship, is it?  At one point Billy sat in Skyler's chair, slammed his hands down on the desk, glared at my son and said, ""This is my last offer.  No negotiation!""  Ethan just looked at him and mildly inquired, ""What's going to happen to me if I do?""  I'm a little cloudy on what happened next, because I was trying not to laugh, but I think we were invited to leave again.  At any rate, we left.  

When Keith, my husband got home that evening we talked about what happened and discussed that he would come up from the price he had told me to use, I said, ""Great, I'll call Skyler back."", and Keith replied, ""Don't bother.  It sounds like that Billy guy just really doesn't want to sell us a car, and he's obviously Skyler's boss.  I guess he just doesn't like you and it's worth it to him to pass up a sale.  He just doesn't want to deal with you.""  So Ethan and I made plans to go to Santa Monica Toyota after Christmas.  Read on to find out how Skyler and Marc literally snatched us out of that dealership and back to DCH...

The morning of December 26th Skyler called.  Now that's a great salesman.  His boss, who is supposed to be helping him make sales,  destroyed his deal and yet he's still trying.  I respect that kind of determination.  I told him that Keith was willing to go up in price, but that we felt Billy didn't want to sell us a car, so that's why I hadn't called him.  I told him what the new ""top price"" was, and that I'd love him to be the one to sell me the car, but that I wouldn't deal with Billy again because he is, as my son so aptly describes him, ""kind of a dick.""  Skyler said he'd talk to his boss and get back to me one way or the other with a simple yes or no.  

The next morning Ethan and I headed out to Toyota of Santa Monica. We were in the dealership negotiating with the salesman when Marc called.  He apologized for Billy and told me that he knew we could salvage the deal.  He couldn't believe that Billy let me walk out of there without trying to reach some kind of middle ground.  He gave me a price that wasn't quite what my husband wanted, but was a lot closer than what Billy had said was his final price.  We called my husband and he gave us another number.  We called Marc back and he gave us a deal we liked, so we walked right out of your competitor's showroom and back to DCH.  Where Marc and Skyler did indeed, deliver customer happiness!

I will be happy to recommend DCH Toyota of Simi to anyone, with the caveat that they ask for Skyler or Mark!  And walk away if Billy show up.

Sincerely,
Lisa Stark",4.0

She's been driving a Ford Expedition for about 12 years, and we're getting old so she didn't want a sedan nor another large SUV. The Venza is easy to get in and out of. We visited a few dealerships and, frankly, received a slightly lower price than DCH Toyota of Simi Valley from the dealership in Thousand Oaks. But we selected Simi Valley because of two salespersons, Christian S. and Bill L. They were friendly, attentive and answered all our questions honestly. Moreover, they followed up on our request for a particular color and equipment option in a timely manner. (It wasn't in their inventory, so it had to come from another dealership.)

My sales team followed up, listened, asked questions, and showed professionalism and genuine interest in fulfilling my car needs.  When I returned to trade in my lease, the dollar amount didn't work for me.  My sales team took an almost unrealistic request and made it happen.  If it were not for my team, their commitment, and knowledge-- I'm positive this deal would have never happened. They fought to meet my financial need and then some. I was so happy, I returned the same day to trade in my second vehicle.  I had already contacted several other dealerships to find the vehicle I was intersted in and the amount I was willing to pay. To no avail-- other dealerships were not willing to compramise or negotiate.  Marc and Christian found my ""other"" dream vehicle at another of their dealerships and made this deal happen too.  Where another dealership was asking $7k more for the same used vehicle, my sales team lowered the price considerably to make this deal work for me.

We did not find anyone more knowledgeable, direct, and easy to work with than Jason.  Before stepping in the door, he had spoken to the DCH Toyota's general manager to get the pricing we were asking for pre-approved.  During the test drive, Jason was attentive to our questions and had an answer to everything.  Since we had already been researching for so long, we had exactly what we wanted and what we were willing to pay in mind, and Jason facilitated the transaction with ease, effectiveness, and efficiency.  We were in and out of there in under 3 hours.

We couldn't have been happier with the service and price for the vehicle.  Jason kept emphasizing how it's the dealership's mentality to ensure customer happiness so that they maintain long-term relationships and establish repeat customers.  He lived and breathed this motto with everything he did for us, from getting the pricing pre-approved to addressing all of our concerns to making sure there were cookies in the kitchen.

I left the dealer at 11:45 PM on a Friday night and on Sat AM, Cesar picked me up from the car rental agency, Nick put my new floor mats in and got me a gift bag.

Ceasar needed help with some of the paperwork and at least two other members of his team stepped in immediately to help him - all very pleasant.

I talked with Jeff for the entire week. Jeff explained on Friday that the car was sold,eariler that morning. I was a bit disappointed. On October 8th 2011, I called Jeff once again, but I spoke to Peter Conway, about asking Jeff if could return my call which he did. Peter was one of the most professional men that I have spoken with in a long time. I was in retail for twelve years and I know just how customers should be treated. Jeff did return my call. He spoke of having another auto that I may be listed in. We continued to talk regarding the auto. Jeff and the Simi Valley Team worked very hard to get me the note and the auto. I just wanted to say that Simi Valley is my best car buying expreince. I will recomend them to anyone that is in the market for a auto.

836,"September 25, 2011","Yes, you can believe the reports about Jeff Johnson--he's the most straightforward car salesman I've ever encountered. (Also, you can rest assured that, unlike other Toyota dealers in the area--COUGH BOB SMITH COUGH--all of these are real.) I also have to say that Jeff &amp; DCH are notable for what they *didn't* do (bad stuff) as what they *did*:

1) A closer Toyota dealership in L.A. didn't have any Toyota Corolla CEs, and prob. didn't want my business; the guy didn't want to offer me a price until I was &quot;ready to buy.&quot;
2) Another L.A. Toyota dealership, the hyper-aggressive salesman refused to quote me a price without running a credit check on me, which would've given him a huge advantage over me in terms of sales negotiations.
3) An outside-of-LA dealership was better than the previous two, but Jeff's offer was $1100 lower than theirs. Yes, that's right. $1100. Granted, I got lucky by wanting a car they wanted to increase their volume of sales on, but still.

Jeff emailed me a very good offer, complete with OUT THE DOOR PRICE; he and the rest of the Internet team were courteous, polite, and straightforward. When I first came to the lot to check out the car under a different internet salesman, AT NO POINT did the salesman pressure me to buy the car. 

Repeat: AT NO POINT did Jeff's co-worker pressure me to buy the car or fill out any sort of &quot;credit check.&quot; WHILE I WAS ON THE LOT.

During the actual sale the next day, AT NO POINT did Jeff try to upsale me on anything I didn't want, or try to steer me towards one of the more expensive Corollas. 

The final price I purchased the car was the OUT THE DOOR price quoted in the email, plus $100 for mudguards; Jeff also saved me money by pointing out I could get the mudguards uninstalled and avoid the labor fee. Which I did. Let's look at that again: the OUT THE DOOR PRICE incorporated ALL SALES TAXES &amp; FEES. There were NO HIDDEN FEES tacked on that were not previously mentioned. NONE. 

What exactly do they put in the water at DCH Toyota and how can we get it into the water at other car dealerships? 

Overall experience downrated slightly because the Finance Team tried to get me to buy the useless extended warranties, No reflection on Jeff &amp; Bryan, but they may want to have a word with their finance dept. about not trying to sell people things they don't need. 

However, given Jeff, Bryan, and the internet team's excellent behavior, I would strongly recommend seeking him, and DCH Toyota of Simi Valley, out as your first choice when you're looking for a car. Doesn't matter how far away you live. It will be worth it. Shop around, to be sure, but pay particular attention to what Jeff does &amp; doesn't do as compared with what other salespeople at other dealerships will try to pull. Treating customers with honesty &amp; integrity deserves to be rewarded.

Needless to say my husband and I were really aprehensive after the experience with Ventura Toyota, however, we really needed a car after my car had been totaled out in an accident. Thank GOD!!! for Gus Herrera our ""Knight in Shining Armor"". From the time we met him he let us know that we were in the drivers seat, he was there to provide a service for us. For the amount of time it would take to make the deal, he was our employee. He was not going to insist that we purchase something we didn't want, whatever we purchased would be our own decision. It is this sense of customer service that enabled me to get alot of items included in my purchase, extended warranty, lojack, etc because my husband trusted Gus. So to make a long story short whenever anyone asks where did I got my beautiful 2011 VENZA, I will highly recommend DCH Totota of Simi Valley.

I realize that it took more than one person to make our deal and I want to thank them as well however, we spent a majority of our time with Gus. My husband and I have even decided to get our vehicle serviced there even though it is approx 40 miles from our home because of the customer service.

853,"September 08, 2011","I could probably go on forever....I had suffered through going to Kia, Honda, Nissan, and two other Toyota dealers.After three weeks of test driving and fighting off crapy salesmen ""aka voltures"" my sister recommended that we stop at DCH Toyota. Upon our arrival we saw several salesmen standing outside and the two of us immediately looked at eachother and rolled our eyes at what we thought was to come. As we approached the door Christian greeted us and we responded that we didn't need assistance. Once we went and looked around we sought him out to request a test drive. He was quick friendly and knowledgable (three qualities she and I didn't think were possible in a car sales person) after the test drive, we went in to talk numbers. Christian introduced us to Nick who provided me with an array of price and package options. He was like a freaking Wizard or something lol he was great. Once a price was agreed upon for the Venza, Christian introduced us to his partner (forgot his name but it's not my fault. Please understand that I was practically brain dead from dealing with all of those idiots at other dealers). His buddy was so funny and informative. He explained the Warranty and Maintenance agreement to us and then I was introduced to Bijan in the finance deparment. Bijan was so efficient and though I was dreading this part of the deal, he made it so painless that I wouldn't mind going through the process at least quarterly. Hell, bi-monthly. All and all I had one of the best labor days EVER spent at this dealership. They even had freakin CHEESEBURGERS and SODA. I will never go to another dealership and I would recommend other places to anyone that is intelligent. All I can say is if people value their time and have self respect they will go visit Christian. And last but by no means least,....their popcorn was even better than the Northridge Toyota's popcorn (this could have been becasue I was enjoying myself and not just eating it to fill the void of crappy service). Yum.  My conclusion is #1 my big sister is super intelligent and I am glad I listened to her and my #2 conclusion is that This dealership is built on a firm foundation with a core desire to build lasting relationships with their clients. I spent so much time writing this review because, with their help, I saved oodles of time not having to continue to car shop, I get to be here at home comfy with my laptop with my fluffy multi-colored socks with my dog on my lap and my brand new car parked in my driveway.

It's rare to find individuals that enjoy their job and are good at it...but Dean Dixon is definitely one of them. He is prompt, true to his word, and very responsive. I never felt pressured to buy or like some slimy salesman was trying to pull one over on me. In addition, Dean (and the dealership) honors their commitment to allow you to return your newly purchased vehicle within 3 days (no questions asked). After 2 days, I realized that the used car that I bought was not exactly what I needed. Dean committed himself to finding me the perfect replacement and, within 24 hours, I successfully exchanged it for an even better vehicle with no hassle (although there was additional paperwork). 

In addition, the other salesman were friendly and respectful and I had a pleasant experience with the finance department.

I recommend Jason Skyler at DCH Toyota. If you are in need of an auto, please do youself a favor and talk to Jason Skyler at DCH Toyota.",5.0

Angel kindly agreed to have Mark drive over to help me. He almost immediately spotted my keys inside the windshield wiper area. Of course, I felt like a complete doofus.

constantly asking us what could they assist us with. Mark came up to us when we first arrived and asked if we needed any help and my husband told him we were just looking.

From the time Marc Blumberg picked up the phone when I called to see if they had the car I wanted in stock, I knew I was in good hands.  He was friendly, upbeat and inviting.  He made me WANT to buy a car from him.  I am an owner/manager in a sales profession and I just wish everyone in my office was like Marc.

The price we negotiated was great, even though they had to spend time and money in a dealer trade from a Toyota store over 100 miles from the dealership.  The car was ready when we needed it to be and was beautifully detailed.

I have never had a salesperson and a dealership take so much time familiarizing me with a vehicle.  With today's navagation system, bluetooth, HomeLink and other features it seems you need a computer degree to work the car.  Marc taught us everything we needed to know.

956,"June 06, 2011","I had an opportunity to work with Ed Tastic for my new Prius purchase. 

Unfortunately, the dealer didn't have the color that I wanted and I ended up purchasing the new vehicle somewhere else. But I wish I could do business with Ed and the team since they have provided me with the great, genuine customer service that I could ever experience at car dealerships. Ed is a very honest, caring person who looks after customers' benefits. 

Additionally the dealer's physical layout creates an airy, welcoming atmosphere and I felt very comfortable sitting there. It was unlike any other auto dealerships cluttered with cubicles. 

I will definitely come back to DCH Toyota Simi Valley to have my car serviced as well as future purchase.

He maintained a most pleasurable attitude during the process of trying to negotiate a deal and although I left not having purchased the vehicle at this time, Christian left me feeling that he did and will do all he can to earn my business.

Nothing could more fantastic than working with Ed*Tastic, who took excellent care and patiently ensured that customer's questions and doubts were addressed, all the way from model description /differences, selection, test drive, to timely delivery of the car and keys! He also provided great after-sale customer service, in addressing customer's requests even though such requests were not is his area of function.

I'm not one for car salesmen, in fact I avoid them whenever possible, but not with Claudio, he was very friendly, and I felt no pressure of any kind.

He promised to see that our new car would be detailed after hours at a discount, but he never made a serious effort to arrange it. He said we would receive a fabulous gift bag of stuff worth $160, but it turned out to be a bunch of crap worth about $7.

Ed is far from the worst car salesman I ever dealt with. He's just a typical car salesman. He will say anything to get you to sign. We are satisfied with our new Scion TC.

1020,"April 17, 2011","From the time I initiated contact through the Kelly Blue Book page, until I drove off the lot in my new Prius yesterday, this dealership was fantastic. Great customer service, fair pricing, and an honest approach to everything. The salesman, Jeff Johnson, was great. He e-mailed me a quote on the model I was interested in. The price was right what I was looking for and well in line with Kelly Blue book. I set up an appointment, selected a vehicle, and test drove it.  Jeff was very knowledgeable about the vehicle and spent quite a bit of time answering all my questions. The negotiations were pleasant and professional. Financing was easy. After I signed the paperwork, Jeff spent time helping me program the vehicle for phone use and review for any questions I might have. The manager even came out with a bag filled with some promotional items to take with me. I would highly recommend them to anyone and will be back when I purchase my next vehicle.

1055,"March 11, 2011","I was interested in a Toyota Prius that was priced at $17991 at a DCH Honda dealership in Lemon Grove, CA. Christian, the salesperson, had originally  brought this vehicle to my attention and showed me the stats on the vehicle and said he could get it to the dealership in Simi Valley easily because they were sister dealerships through DCH. I noticed that it was coming from a Honda dealership, not Toyota, so I specifically asked if this car was certified and had the certified warranty. He replied ""yes absolutely they all are."" I went home that night to sleep on it and decided to look at the car on the Lemon Grove website, the price at that time was $17991 on the website. The next morning I decided to look at the website again and the price had been reduced to $14995. I immediately called Christian and told him that the price had been dropped and that I was interested in buying it. He was very surprised that the other dealer had lowered the price and expressed that he thought it was a mistake. He called the Lemon Grove dealership and confirmed that the price was indeed CORRECT, he then told me that he would not be able to offer me the vehicle at $14995 because it still needed to be certified. When I asked why he had told me the vehicle was certified when it was NOT he claimed he didn't know that it was coming from a Honda dealer. I don't believe that was true because he was the one that explained that it was a sister dealership the day before. So I asked him what price they could offer and he told me that the total certification and ""shipping costs"" (he had not mentioned shipping costs before this) would bring the price back up to $17995. (Hmmm convenient). I obviously was not happy with being lied to and made that clear to him. I was seriously contemplating making the drive to Lemon Grove to purchase the car there and just buy an extended warranty through them. He told me he would have his manager call me to see what they could do. A few hours later I got a call from Nick the general manager at Simi Toyota. He told me that they would be willing to offer me the car at the price the Lemon Grove dealership was offering, which he said was $15995. When I told him the website advertised it at $14995 he told me to check the website again, because what he was seeing was $15995. I happened to have the webpage already up on my computer and refreshed the screen, they had changed the price from $14995 to $15995. I felt a bit like I was being duped, but still thought that $15995 was a fair price for the car with the certified warranty, so I asked him to have it shipped to Simi. I went down the next day to test drive and really liked the car. I worked with Nick that day and felt he was more honest and straight forward than Christian was. I went home feeling good about the car and told him that I would be back with my fiance the next day, to have him test drive it. Nick had told me that I would be working with Christian the next day because he would not be in. I was a bit worried about this. We came in the next day and my fiance inspected the car. He immediately brought to my attention that there was significant wear on the front tires and they would need to be replaced very soon. When I mentioned this to Christian he said he wasn't sure if they would be able to put new front tires on because the ""deal"" that we had worked out was with Nick and not him and he would not be able to change it. (I was thinking, didn't this car go through a certified warranty inspection, shouldn't this have been caught??) Nick had told me the day prior if we had any problems to give him a call. So I asked Christian to call him to see what could be done. He called Nick then handed me the phone telling Nick I needed to talk to him about something. (we were still in the middle of the test drive, I was in the passenger seat). I explained to Nick the problem with the tires and he told me to tell Christian to have their mechanic look at it. I relayed this message to Christian. It turns out that the service department was closed that day and I would have to come back another day to have them measure the wear on the tires to make sure that it was above the certified standards of 5/32"". A little frustrating when the car should have gone through an inspection and they should have already measured this. Also at the beginning of the test drive I had noticed that the low tire pressure warning light was on and asked Christian about this. (Again, this car supposedly went through a certified inspection, shouldn't this have been caught??) He assured me that it was just the weather that caused this and it was normal. Suffice it to say, I had my doubts. The light ended up staying on all day, and it was a nice sunny day, not freezing cold. Another thing that happened at the beginning of the test drive the day before--when Christian went to demonstrate the smart key door sensor, it did not work. He told me that the keys just needed to be reset, and this was an easy fix. (Again, shouldn't this have been caught??) When I came in the next day with my fiance he told me that the keys actually didn't work and I would be getting a ""brand new set."" (exact words) What I was actually given was one used key (that started the car and locked/unlocked it but did not work with the door sensor) and one new key (that didn't work at all). He then told me to get them reprogrammed I would need to go to a dealership in Oxnard because they do not charge the dealership for the reset fee. I asked him why I was getting one new key and one used key when I was told I was going to get ""a brand new set"", I felt I should be getting 2 brand new keys to make a ""set"". He replied that Nick was already giving me a good deal and I should be happy. (Ummmm ok.) I explained that the way he worded the expression of ""a set of brand new keys"" was misleading. Ultimately in the end I bought the car with the promise that 1.)They would check the tires to see if they needed replacing, 2.)They would check the tire pressure when service was open on Monday 3.)I would be driving to Oxnard to get my keys reprogrammed. When I came in on Monday to get the tires checked, the mechanic measured them and indeed said they were below the certified standards. (Did this car go through an inspection at all?) They needed to order the tires and I would have to come back when they came in, also at that time they would check the tire pressure warning light. Nick said they would be calling me when they found out when the tires would be in and also to give me the information about who to see at the Oxnard dealership to get my keys reprogrammed. When it reached Friday and I still had not received a call I called Nick to find out if the tires had come in. He apologized for not calling me, and told me the tires would be in the next day and I should come in the next Monday to drop my car off to get the tires put on. He also said that they would be reprogramming the keys at their dealership after all. (I guess whatever deal that Oxnard was giving them was not available anymore?) I was happy to not have to drive out to Oxnard and thought that it should have been planned this way all along. I dropped my car off that Monday and they gave me a ride to work and picked me up at the end of the day. I was happy to see that the tires were on, the pressure warning light was off and both keys worked. When working with Nick I felt that he listened to me and did his best to accommodate my requests. When working with Christian I felt he would say anything to get me to buy a car, regardless of whether it was the truth or not. I don't feel like Christian listens to his customers questions or thinks before he answers, he just says whatever he thinks you want to hear. Also he touches you on the arm frequently like you are best friends, which can be a bit off-putting. I prefer a bit more professional approach. I also got a call from him today AT MY PLACE OF WORK following up and asking when I was going to write this review. How he got this number I do not know, because I am actually at a different office today than I am normally at and I did not put this office number on my application. The number that I gave him to contact me was my cell phone. He did not call my cell phone, he somehow called here, interrupted my exam with a patient that I had at that time on an extremely busy morning, just to ask if I was planning to fill out this review. I found this very inappropriate. Ultimately I am happy I bought my car, I do love it. I also feel I received a generally fair price in the end. I felt like I had to fight tooth and nail to get that price in the end, and it was a bigger ordeal than it should have been. I felt like I had to watch over every little detail of the purchase to make sure I was not getting screwed out of money because I could never really trust what I was being told. I am also concerned with the certified ""inspection"" process that the cars go through at this dealership.",2.8

Dale handled it all very professionally and with good communication between us.  He also looked for the best coupon combination for the best prices for service.  His service pros found that the water pump was leaking; it was replaced under warranty.  We also had a recent unusual clicking in the dash when the gas engine started up or turned off (like at a stoplight).  It turned out to be a mixer assembly.  Parts were ordered, arrived within a week, an appointment was set-up and it was replaced under the extended warranty ($50 deductable).  Dale also arranged for the dealer to pay for a rental car for the day while service was being done.  Usually I just use the convenient shuttle to get to/from work during service but unexpectedly needed wheels during the day so this was greatly appreciated.

Thanks Dale!  Thanks DCH Toyota of Simi Valley! ",5.0
1064,"March 04, 2011","The experience at DCH Toyota greatly exceeded my expectations. Buying a car is usually a very stressful experience for me, but not at this dealership. The Sales team lead by John Daniels (Salesmen) and supported by Financial Executive Mike Dowl made the experience for Kristin, Kayla, Rebecca and I a memorable one.  I have bought a lot of cars in my life both new and used but what I really liked at DCH was there ability to listen to what are needs were, and provided a vehicle that met those needs. No pushing us into a car that we could not afford or adding options that we did not need, just providing a good car for a good price and then going through the financing process without pressure or glitches. In fact, we were happily surprised that the interest rate and associated monthly payment that we agreed on the previous evening ended up being less when we came to finalize everything and pick up the car the next day!! I think that everyone in my family agree that we finally we found a dealership that we fell comfortable trusting in addressing our current and future car needs. Thank you Jon & Mike.  Job well done!!!

I gave her my credit card to hold the car,then two days later I went to pick it up.  

I personally buy all our equipment, big trucks, forklifts, and 95% of our inventory at work.  So I am not at novice at purchasing.  I can't explain to you in words how easy and painless this transaction was.  Natalie and Brian (I think her boss) from DCH Toyota in Simi Valley were extremely pleasant and very very helpful in every way possible.

I could say if you are looking for any model Toyota please call Natalie or Brian, they were truly outstanding to deal with on all levels.

Furthermore I was most impressed how they went out of their way to go over each and every bell and whistle to make sure I knew how to use every option on that car!

1068,"March 01, 2011","I had a really great experience buying my new Scion Tc.  Everyone was very friendly and the process was quick and easy.  Last time I purchased a car from Mazda, the dealer doubted I had the funds to purchase the car and it wasn't a great experience.  

Jason was very responsive and had lots of patience while I checked out cars.  The couple cars I chose to drive, he basically ran to get the keys so I would have to wait.  I really hate processes that take forever when you have the cash and just want to write the check.

Dean Dixon is a cool cat.  A very friendly guy and he took the extra effort to get to know me and my girlfriend.  Dean did a great job of explaining the contract and all the steps of receiving my Tc.  I felt like he was proud to deliver the car to me and that I was happy with everything.  

Bijan Rahimi worked very quickly to get threw all of the paper work.  Explained all of the service they offer and any other services they provided.  He never tried to push anything on me. Bijan just gave me advice and information.

I'm very happy with this dealership and look forward to having a long and great relationship.  The reason I gave them a 4 on customer service was because sometimes it was hard to get someone on the phone who knew the status of my car.  Partly I was really excited to get my car back ASAP with all the upgrades I ordered.  With that said they did rent me a car and delivered the car on the day they said they would.  ",4.6

1072,"February 28, 2011","My experience may be slightly unique among car buyers.  I had been in a desperate need of a car, walking around Simi Valley Auto Mall, and facing a situation that required making a very quick decision on a rather large purchase.  Mind you, since I hadn't recently been in the market for a car, I had to also make this decision with no research.  In terms of buying a car, I knew this was an extremely precarious position.  Only a trusted dealer could have gotten me out of that perfect storm.  Imagine having to put that much trust in a person you just met.  

Only by pure luck did I end up walking into DCH Toyota.  Within a few hours, Christian had me in a used car, and I was on my way home with a full tank of gas to boot.  However, the story does not end there.  The used car had quite a few miles on it, and I had become increasingly paranoid about its performance.  Eventually, I drove it back to DCH in the hopes of trading it back in.  The folks at DCH could have pointed out that I had made my purchase ""as is"" and sent me on my way.  In fact, I was expecting that to happen.  To my surprise, there were no scowls - no twisting of arms - only a smile and an immediate compliance to unwind the deal using my innitial down payment for a 2011 Camry.  This is a beautiful car in every aspect.  

DCH Toyota is a rarity in the modern retail culture of customer pressure.  There is a reason they are the number one rated Toyota dealer in the state.  It's pure and simple - their number one priority is the customer, and my experience is proof of that.   ",5.0
1073,"February 28, 2011","I found dealing with DCH Simi Valley Toyota straightforward and hassle free.  I researched the car I wanted online, Venza, and asked for quotes from several dealers.  Jeff Johnson was the first one who responded with choices, specs and price (MSRP and internet price).  He was quick to respond to my subsequent questions, either by email or call.  When I found the car I wanted from more than one dealership, I went to Jeff first because he's the most straightforward.  But of course, I wouldn't buy off the bat without going to another dealer to validate the price and perhaps make a better deal.  The trip to the second dealer showed me that Simi Valley and Jeff Johnson was definitely the better choice.  Long story short, I asked Jeff to search high and low for the car I wanted and he got it for me at a price I'm happy with.

Michael Dowl, the finance manager, was also pleasant to work with.  He's organized and efficient.  He made us feel comfortable with the financing process.  He disclosed what needs to be disclosed and offered warranties, one of which I bought.

Everyone we saw had a smile and a friendly nod, making us feel more like we were hanging out with friends than buying a car.

Dean Dixon, the salesperson who worked with us, made the entire process enjoyable from start to finish and was genuinely interested in our needs and wants. He has a gentle, non-stop sense of humor that made even the necessarily lengthy paperwork procedures painless.

We came upon this dealership pretty much by accident.

But more to the point, she is amazingly straightforward, down-earth, honest and without any pushing or traditional selling whatsoever. She responded to all my questions and concerns immediately and made the buying experience actually great. And Bijan in financing blew me away. He's incredibly experienced, knowledgeable and truly worked me to get the best financing I could imagine. Way better than even my credit union which always beat everyone in the past.  
My car came all set and equipped with everything as I'd requested. And all the follow-up questions and things that have to be done were also done quickly and to my satisfaction. And it seems that everyone in the place is friendly without that pushiness you see in most dealerships.

I do not begrudge a dealership from trying to turn a profit on any/all aspects of the deal, but I had to decline this extra several times before they finally moved on.

More customer service than sales person which is why we bought a new car.  If Hugh had been the standard aggressive sales person, we would never have purchase a car from this dealer. He was thorough and quick to respond.

Good experience because of Hugh.  

Although we did not finance, were sent to see Finance Manager, Bijan Rahimi.  Again professional but not pushy in final closing process.  This is often an unpleasant experience and very lengthy.  Previously we had the whole buying experience soured in the ""Finance Office"" because of the hard sell attitude.  Bijan understood that we wanted a streamlined closing situation and responded to us, his customer's desires.  

Last time we came into this dealership, we left without buying.  The sales person was not knowledgeable and took a long time to get information.  The ""closer"" was inflexible and we went up the street and bought a Honda immediately after leaving this dealer.  Glad to see the dealer is hiring a more professional level of sales people and the dealership has become more responsive to type of experience the customer seeks instead of trying to ""force feed"" the customer.

1145,"December 29, 2010","I had the best experience I've ever had at a dealership's service dept. when I went to DCH in Simi Valley. Dale was my advisor and he was warm, friendly and informative. It's difficult (at least for me)to trust a dealership's assessment of problems on a vehicle because you can't be too sure if you're being ripped off, so to speak, especially if it's happened in the past.  However my experience with Dale was different and I didn't get any sense that I was being taken advantage of and felt very comfortable with his findings and advice.  To top it all off, when I was scheduled to come back in for service, Dale fell ill before that day and called me to say he wouldn't be there. He did assure me that I would still be taken care of if I chose to still go in. That goes beyond basic good customer service. I had planned to continue going to the service dept. there but that call from Dale sealed the deal. Like to add that when I went in while Dale was out, I was treated very well by Mike in service and he took good care of me, they make a great team. Reviews are very helpful but you can't be too sure of who is writing one. So take a chance and start off small, such as an oil change, if you're reluctant, and see for yourself how you're treated. I don't believe they'll let you down.  P.S. I went in one day for something I thought I needed and once Dale checked my records he let me know it wasn't needed yet. It could have been a sale, but that's not the way to keep customers. I'm definitely a customer for as long as I have my Toyota.",4.8

Steven was great; he walked me through all the features and answered every single question (I had a lot).  He never pressured me, and made sure that the car I got was exactly the right fit for me.  He's the best!

Bijan was also great.  Normally I would not consider the extended warranty, but since the Prius parts are so expensive, he basically just armed me with the information I needed to make a choice and walked me through some scenarios; he did this all without scaring me or pressuring me.  He worked with me, and had a great attitude and a lovely demeanor.  

This is definitely not your run-of-the-mill dealership: the people are friendly, the prices are right, and I just couldn't be happier with my new car!",5.0

Thanks for everything.

1254,"August 18, 2010","customer Service was great, the internet response was quick and i received both an email and a phone call (Maria?, not sure what her name was).  Everyone was friendly during the whole experience. Quality of work was good, i showed up and had to wait about 10 to 15 minutes until they could find an ""internet"" sales person but i found out that the internet prices are availalbe to everyone and not a special price for internet so i did not see the importance unless it is needed to distribute the leads. Ed was very pleasant showed us the cars and had answers for all questions.  i felt i was given a fair price for my trade in, i figured i would not get much but it was better than having my wife deal with strangers coming by the house to see the truck. Overall experience turned from great to good during the final price and the attempt to add additional cost to the deal.  I understand up selling and offering additional items but i felt the attempts were deceptive.  The $299 etch window service was added and not discussed.It was brushed over with the commit that this is already added in the payment. After noticing it on the final purcahse contract i had it removed.The extended service plan was offered at 2 different prices ($1995 and $1595).  Bijan sold it to me after i declineed the higher price that was originally offered but after considering what i paid for, the employee discounted price of $1595 (what i paid) was actually 63% of the original price and is really just prorated because it is a used car (original purchase was 2007) so i don't get 7yr/100k miles but 4yrs/65k miles so the price was just prorated or that is how i see it.  I understand that was probably fair but it was sold as if i was getting a special price if i took it at that time.  i probably should have thought about it longer. I had financing arranged but Bijan convienced me to use toyota's financing at the same interest rate. I paid a little more than i wanted to pay after research on the internet but this is my local dealer and wanted to start there and did not really want to travel around more, it was a hot day and i work long hours so i figured i would pay for the convience. We were given a voucher for after market hubcaps, the ones on the car were scratched pretty bad.  i felt that was nice but i also felt like i was asking for something that was never asked before or that it was too much to ask. Ed was able to get it and i have already been notified that the new hubcaps are in. Lastly,my wife and i distinctly remember 2 keys plus a valet key. We noticed that and enjoy that convience of each having a key when needed to take a car. We were given 1 key and the valet. I feel that one key must have been misplaced when the car was taken back to clean up and gas up (full tank). i've inquired but Ed assures me that we got all the keys. He offered me an option to purchase a key for $275 but that just seems ridiculous since we saw an additional key. Overall Experienc was a 3, 'Okay'. Everyone was very nice, i like the car but a few things made it just an Okay experience.  ",4.2

I purchased a Corolla from DCH Toyota in Sept. 2009. The experience was pleasant an professional.
For the past few months, I have been researching and looking for an additional vehicle at DCH Toyota and other dealerships. When I came back to DCH Toyota this past month, I met Mr. Lawrence Richardson who assisted my wife and myself in purchasing a 2010 Prius. I found working with Mr Richardson and the Sale Manager a stress-free negotiation.  I found the neogotiation process very smooth without any major and unnecessary haggling. Bidding and counter bidding were direct by both parties, and I found it helpful in meeting my purchasing goals.
I finalized the financing and contract w/Finance Manager Bijan Rahimi. Coincidently, I had worked with him in Sept 2009 when I purchased the Corolla. I found Mr. Rahimi very efficient with the paperwork and knowledgeable of Toyota products, and his 
attributes still hold true for today.

They explained different option for us and they added on features we wanted, and called us back right away.

The entire process was stress-free, quite a change from the usual hard sell that you're subjected to in car dealerships.  Anyway, at the end of everything, not only did I get the car I wanted at the price I wanted to pay, I even got a few extras which I didn't expect.

1305,"July 21, 2010","I purchased my new Prius by requesting a quote from their Internet Sales Manager Brian Lamb.  I compared Brian's quote with other online new pricing guides and found DCH in Simi Valley to be very competitive.  The entire process was totally enjoyable, Brian was very pleasant and professional and the price that was quoted was the price I paid.  Mike Dowl, who did the finance paperwork, was equally pleasant and was very helpful in explaining finance options as well as other options such as the long-term benefits of extended warrantees, etc.  I have already recommended this dealership to my friends and will return next year when my wife will be purchasing a new Toyota for herself.",5.0
1306,"July 20, 2010","We had such a great experience with Pedro Leon.   He has serviced our needs a couple of times now and we really trust him.   He is very friendly and not too pushy.   We always know what we are looking for and how much we can spend.   Some salesman are too pushy to spend more and it's a turn off.   Also,   Hank and Chris in the service department always take care of our vehicles and they are awesome too.   We will continue to return to this dealership in the future.

1307,"July 20, 2010","I purchased a used 2006 Honda Accord EX V6 Coupe with 60k miles that I had seen an ad for online. The car was in good/excellent condition, especially good for being 4 years old.

I dealt primarily with Internet Sales Manager Brian then was turned over to Bijan in finance. Brian was excellent in all regards. He was responsive to how I wanted to handle the transaction. For example, I was focused on the total price and not a monthly payment so that's how we negotiated. He didn't do that pushy salesman thing of just brushing me off and continuing with his agenda or any of those ""tactics"" in general.

Bijan in finance was typical of a car salesman but not overly bad. He tried to sell the extended warranties, upgrades, etc. although it was more mechanical than pushy. I think it helped that I was prepared; it took the wind out his sales a bit. His typical little comments like, ""I'm not supposed to go this low BUT..."" insulted my intelligence.

So, Brian gets 5/5 and Bijan 3/5 for an average of 4/5.

As always, prepare:
1. Read Consumer Reports and test drive until you know what car you want.
2. Arrange for financing through your bank. Use it as leverage to negotiate APR at the dealer.
3. Line up an honest mechanic that you can bring the car to for inspection.
4. Research mandatory CA fees vs optional dealer fees at the DMV site.
5. Look up the Edmund's TMV price (more useful than KBB).
6. Shop around the Internet.
7. Make notes and take them with you to the dealer. Know your price ahead of time.

If you do all that, your transaction will likely be silky smooth. They won't jerk you around and you'll get a good a price. Just remember to let them make a few hundred dollars profit, too!",4.4
1308,"July 18, 2010","I did not expect my local dealer DCH Toyota of Simi Valley participates in the Costco auto program (which I highly recommend). My wife and I were pleasantly surprised how knowledgeable, courteous, and professional Jeff Johnson and the staff were. There was no pressure at all and we actually walked out initially since we were not ready to buy. Then couple of days later, we came back and purchased our Highlander. It was the best experience we ever had at any dealer, even after visiting 5 other Toyota dealers for the past couple of weeks. The price we got was incredible thanks to the Costco auto program. We will definitely buy another car here again in the near future. Maybe I can talk my wife into getting a Prius to replace her 2003 Corolla?

He listened to my car needs,and matched me with my PERFECT car, which FAR exceeded my expectations.  I have given his business card to one friend/co-worker already, and she plans to drive from Oxnard, CA,to work with Mr. Gamez.

Of note: I had only planned to test-drive a couple of Scions at DCH Toyota of Simi Valley, and was going to another dealer in the San Fernando Valley, where we purchase most of our cars, to actually buy a car.  My son got his Scion at DCH in Simi just over a year ago, and the experience was good, so we decided to try them for the test drive.

1312,"July 15, 2010","I did my homework and went to another dealer for an initial test drive of the Prius.  Thousand Oaks Toyota.  The sales guy was nice but the Sales Manager was a waste of a heart beat.  Would not even get out of the chair and shake my hand.  Done with that dealer.  Came across Brian from the Toyota web site.  Brian and I discussed options, colors and then price via the internet with NO sales pressure what so ever.  Brian came back with 100% of everything I needed/wanted.  Also had the most competitive price.  Obviously the most important detail.  

Made an appointment to meet with Brian. I thought for sure he/they would try and change the #'s or not honor the internet pricing we agreed on.  I was wrong.  Totally honest, upfront with absolutley no hard pressure selling techniques I have experienced from past car purchasing experiences.  As a bonus, they even gave me significantly more for my trade in then I expected.  The entire purchase was extremely easy, quick and thorough on Brian's part.  Brian really displayed enthusium about the Prius I purchased, spend a lot of time going over the features with me having thorough knowledge of the car.  Much more then any other car sales person I have ever worked with.

Brian was professional, honest and even came to my home to pick up the title to my car that I traded it as I forgot to bring it to the dealer.  Lastly, the General Manager came out to thank me for purchaing the car there.  A real class act!  The entire staff was obviously professionaly trained.

Steve Van Velzer went over everything in the car to make sure I knew how to use every option before I left and made it clear that if I had further questions or problems, that I could call him anytime.  I would definately recommend this dealership to my friends and famly.  I did not feel taken advantage of due me being a single female entering the dealership alone.

1360,"April 25, 2010","Did not intend to purchase, however found the employees helpful and able to help me get the car I wanted within the payment range I found acceptable. Originally found a similar car on ebay under this dealership.  When I arrived, it was not available so I was shown those available. ",4.8
1361,"April 25, 2010","First, I would like to thank Servando for making our auto purchase experience so enjoyable. My daughter and I were looking for a used car under a tight budget since this was my daughter’s first purchase of her own car after college.  The last one she drove was purchased from a used car lot in the Valley by her parents.  We were hesitant to go buy another one from the used car lot again after experiencing the added repair/service charges that you can not avoid when you purchase a used car with some years of driving.  So we were looking for the best deal possible used car from a dealership where the cars are at least checked out better, but we immediately found that the prices there were higher than what my daughter could afford.  As we were about to walk out the lot feeling that we needed to try somewhere else, Servando was introduced to us by Jason, who made the right decision to hand us over to a pro.  

We were determined to keep our pricing in check not to go over our planned numbers.  Knowing that you will most likely end up with more at the end of signing the purchase docs because of all the other wonderful packages they will offer you; we made sure that we would keep our original purchase price as low as possible to meet our final goal. After going through other dealerships, we really didn’t care anymore what the car sales man thought of us for insisting on the price we wanted to pay.  Toyota has been under a negative spotlight lately and I was even thinking (hoping) that they maybe desperate to sell a car so they will give us an incredible deal.  There I was wrong, I realized, like myself, more than enough people know that by heart how great Toyota cars are from their own experiences of buying cars over the years.  Even with Toyota’s unfortunate parts purchase choice that is also possible with any auto makers, by knowing the high standards that Toyota is always striving to achieve, I myself was certain that Toyota would do even more thorough checking and make their cars even safer now than ever.  Servando’s confidence in Toyota came through loud and clear with his amazing skill of making us feel that he actually cared what we wanted.  

When I was trying to save a few dollars/month payment, which was normally embarrassing to ask for, he was still smiling and showed that he understood rather than making me feel like an annoying bargainer that I probably was.  He made me feel that it’s OK to fight for my daughter’s best deal. Well, I’m not sure how he did it, but we ended up with a brand new Yaris, a cutest hatchback according to my daughter, with 6 year/100,000 mile warranty, which we couldn’t have with a used car, within our final budget plan. Yes, we did spend more than what we thought we would pay for a car right now, but yet somehow, it made all sense to us.  Interestingly the payment itself came just a few dollars more than a used car we almost purchased at another dealership.  0% interest rate did help.
 
After coming home, my daughter said the funniest thing.  She said to her dad that Servando is the kind of person you want to invite to your home.  I have never heard of that about a car sales man.  He will instantly become your friend who wants you to have the best. That is something that most people will never understand unless you meet Servando. We have purchased cars in the past from different dealers, and Servando is the first who emailed and called us to make sure that everything was fine even after the purchase.  His service is superb in our opinion.

1362,"April 19, 2010","My family and I recently began looking for an additional car to add to our family. We were looking for a full size to travel in comfort that was not a minivan (have one already) and not a  SUV gas guzzler. We decided between checking out the Toyota Avalon and the Ford Taurus after reading reviews online. We visited a Toyota dealership and a Ford dealership in the San Fernando Valley, but we were extremely unsatisfied with the way things went, we ran into bored, feigned interest, impatient, or even annoyed. 

After wards leaving the Ford dealership I decided to search on my Iphone to see if dealers were rated or at least some commentaries online by hitting that old favorite Goggle search. That led us to this site and after reviewing it we saw that there was a high rated Toyota dealership not to far from us, DCH Toyota of Simi Valley. So we got back on the freeway and we were NOT disappointed.

As soon as we rolled into to DCH Toyota of Simi Valley lot, Servando Games was waiting for us we rolled out of the car. He was very affable and came off very sincere after only a couple minutes. At some of the dealerships we went to it felt like we were eyeballed as too how much we could spend. With Servando, it didn't feel like he was judging us or eyeballing us. Did I mention he was charming? My entire family went and my mother fell in love him haha. We ended up going higher then we intended but felt it was worth it after talking with Servando. Heck I was giddy walking around with Servando and listening to him talk and answer our questions about the Avalon, here was someone who knew what he was talking about and selling. No pressure from him and if anything he felt like he was a good friend eager to show off his prized collections. His charm and friendly attitude sold us on the car and on his dealership. After wards he handed us off to Mike Dowl in fniance and we found another cool cat who listened to us (ok my mom bantering about our bad experience with another Toyota dealership). The fact that he sat through ALL that and remained just as cool as ever scored points with me. He got us through all the paperwork with ease and walked us out after wards back to Servando.

While Servando walked us through the car after we signed the papers the Sales Manager Bill (i think) walked up and gave us a gift bag and then the General Manager Nick came out to meet us, take our picture with the car, and we all shook hands.

I've traveled often with my family when we've bought cars (we have 4 already) but this level of courtesy, friendliness, and personal touches are step above the other dealerships I been too. I've yet to try their parts & services but for this experience alone I'm confident in recommending this dealership to anyone looking for a good experience in buying a new car.

1363,"April 18, 2010","I walked in knowing exactly what I was looking for and had the Edmunds TMV report in hand for pricing comparison. They worked with me on pricing and we ended up splitting the difference between what I was asking and what they were asking. Because I didn't finance the vehicle, it was a relatively simple transaction, but the service I received was pleasant and the sales person didn't come across as being pushy. That's important to me as a buyer to keep me from walking out the door. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them. An undecided buyer who is financing might spend more time there and have a different type of engagement, but I think they would be great to work with on that kind of transaction as well.",4.0
1364,"April 18, 2010",Awesome job! They were very patient with me because I was being indecisive. Smooth transaction once I did make my choice. Car was clean on delivery and they went over all the features completely including programming the blue tooth system and the garage door opener.,5.0
1365,"April 16, 2010","Gus Herrera was great!  He was patience, not pushy, and explained the product thoroughly.  He gave us option and realistic opinion.  We don't like spending whole day in a dealership which is why we don't like buying car.  However, this time, I have to say that it was much painless, we get in and out and be confident of getting the best deal too.
When we came to pick up the car, Brian Lamb was very thorough.  I expected they probably would not pay too much attention with us since the deal was already sealed, but NO!  Brian really took his time with us explaining the car feature, setting up some complicated function for us and just really gave us the CARE.  I am very impressed with this dealership.  Would definitely recommend this place to others.  

One thing I don't understand from some dealerships was why they are wasting their time in haggling and exhaust the customer?  In the end, they are losing because customer walked out exhausted and didn't have good experience, probably grouchy... that feeling etched forever and prevent people from returning.

Anyway, DCH Simi Valley should keep up their great job in hassle-free transaction with their best price too!",5.0

This time I was looking for the PRIUS 2010. I narrowed it down between Toyota of Hollywood and DCH Toyota of Simi Valley.

At the end Toyota of Simi Valley was more willing to work with me on the lease package with out much haggling at all, they came out with their best cost right off the bat, so quick I didn't  believe it, so I called Toyota of Hollywood and explained to them the plan. 

Their response at first was that the deal was a looser, how can they do this. I said to them it's a winner for me!

After 30 minutes Hollywood called me back saying that they would match it, but by that time the deal was earned by DCH Toyota of Simi Valley. That was just the start, it got better as they delivered the car.

I was there less than an hour with paperwork signed! -  and my car ready to be picked up, WOW! never before. 
That part really impressed me. Mike in Finance was super cool, no pressure.

Servando and Steve did an outstanding job, very experienced reps. Getting to the point right away, thats what I like! 

Servando walked me over to the service manager an introduced me, two years free maintenance included!
I love my new PRIUS, several of me friends have them and they really like them. I got it while the deal is great, wait until the summer time as gas goes up to $4 per gallon back up to above list. 

My wife asked me, ""Do you trust the car enough to put your kids in it"" I said absolutely, I do and I trust Toyota will always stand behind their products.

I hope this helps anyone looking for a new car! I definitely plan on making DCH Toyota my new dealer for cars.

Servando was personable, informative, knowledgable, and laid back with a great attitude. Nick, the General Manager was hands on, down to earth and friendly. My son wanted the magnetic grey Corolla that Simi Valley was out of, but were able to locate one at the Oxnard dealership.  They arranged to pick it up, wash it and fill it with gas prior to delivery.  They even texted us with the progress of the car, so we were able to go sightseeing until the car was almost ready for us. We had such an awesome experience buying a car here that I could hardly wait to buy one myself. 

My son bought the car he wanted and had a great experience doing it. I purchased a few new cars in the past and always dreaded the experience. It was always very high pressured and time consuming, but not at Simi Valley. I would definitely return to Simi Valley to purchase a car.    ",5.0

This dealership and particularly Brian Lamb went above and beyond for sales and service. Brian Lamb took the time to explain all features of my new PRIUS, and made sure I understood it.

I shopped all of the Toyota dealerships in my area from Oxnard to Mission Hills, from Thousand Oaks to Van Nuys Toyota....for price and service Simi Valley Toyota and especially Brian Lamb took his time to find the right car and explain all of the features.

1407,"January 09, 2010","My wife and I went to DCH Toyota to test drive a Rav 4, and ended up buying one from Steve. This was the easiest dealer experience we've ever had. No pressure, and what seemed to be a good price (do we ever really know if it's a good price?). What really surprized me was that Steve let us drive the car off the lot by ourselves for our second test drive. Of course it only had 3 cups of gas in it, but I was glad to have the time alone in the car to evaluate it.

Over all a good experience, and I would recomend these guys.

I previously said I would never step inside of Thousand Oaks Toyota after being deceived during a previous purchase. 

The only uncomfortable time I experienced was when the final sale was written up, I opted out of a etched in glass security system.  It's purpose was explained to me, however at no time did I agree to purchase it and the ""closing person"" seemed upset that he had to redo the paperwork. ",5.0

1410,"January 05, 2010","Having had a bad experience with another dealership we were going to take the car to an “independent”, but a friend told us to try DCH.  Our service advisor, Paul McCartney, listened to our long winded explanation, without complaint, and explained what he would ask the mechanic do.  He told us he would call us when the car was ready.  He called earlier than we expected to say that an additional problem had come to light when the mechanic had taken the car out for a test drive.  He was very apologetic about the fact that the additional repair would mean that the car would not be ready for pick up that day, which was fine with us.  We wanted the car fixed properly, not fast.  Paul said he would call us on the Monday when the car was ready, and he did.  When we picked up the car, Paul went over the bill with us and discussed the mechanics findings in depth.  

We couldn’t have asked for a better experience.

I purchased a Toyota Van about 10 years ago and my Mom bought a Camry two years ago (at my recommendation) both to our mutual satisfaction.

We were greeted warmly by Steve Van Velzer who walked us around the entire facility showing us the various trucks (Tundra & Tacoma).  Steve showed us a used Tacoma, spoke positively about the vehicle but realistically and took Brett on a test drive.

We then provided our financial information to Steve and discussed various options.  During this process Steve was professional, honest, personable and straight forward.  Steve worked well with us and for us fairly representing my son and I and the dealership.

Bijan (financial manager) was very professional, personalable enough offering the various additional (optional) packages.  Straight forward, efficient, did well.

Overall our experience was very positive - I'd buy again from this dealership - and I would ask for Steve Van Velzer.

1454,"September 22, 2009","DCH Toyota of Simi Valley, is such a nice dealership and also very customer friendly.  They really worked with me and got me the car I wanted (2010 Prius) without any hassle or deception.  I prefer this dealership over every other one I've been to beacause their customer service is amazing.  They really don't want or even need to scam you, they just want you to be happy and thats something you can't say about other dealerships such as First Honda of Simi Valley who wants to just make themselves happy (I know from experience).  Best of all, even after you get your car they are always there to answer any questions and they even sat down with me and helped me get accustomed to where things were and how to work my vehicleS. So thank you to Jeff Q., Dan, and Jason you made my experience wonderful and I love my new car.

1455,"September 07, 2009","We were in the market to buy a new Toyota Yaris or Scion. We came into the dealership and were greated by a typical sales guy. He asked what we were looking for (Yaris 3 door or a Scion XD) and imediately told us he did not have any, but he did have a Corolla and a Matrix we would like more. He was not trying to sell us something we wanted, but rather something he had, which is a big difference. We left and did not feel very good about that visit. We actually came back a few days later and were walking aorund the showroom trying to find a Scion brochure, when we asked the one guy that made eye contact with us, he kind of shrugged his shoulders and said, he didn't think he had any or did not know where they might be and then proceeded to exit the showroom, not even trying to help us. I would not recommend this dealership as they just don't have their act together.

1456,"September 05, 2009","I dreaded the thought of car shopping but when my car (not toyota) got totaled, I had to take the plunge. I actually had a very pleasant experience while buying a car.  I went in prepared for battle and found everyone there to be caring to my needs, finances, and reason for a purchase.  They worked hard to find the car with the options I had reasearched. They knew my budget and stuck to it....not a pushy sale.  Thank you DCH Toyota",5.0
1457,"September 04, 2009","I live closer to 7 other Toyota dealerships.  I chose to drive 30 miles for 2 reasons:  1)  Other dealerships were insulting with their tactics, gouging, hardcore salesmanship and policies.  2)  DCH emphasizes customer service over sales which is a welcomed change and relief.  They don't charge over sticker for high demand/short supply vehicles nor do they disguise over-sticker pricing by charging $2000 for bluetooth (yes, true at another dealer) or other over-priced, mandatory upsales.  The sales manager, Danny Scott, and the salesman, Gus Herrera, did as they said, said as they did and made the process a pleasant one instead of the drudgery other ""closers"" often do.  I've purchased 2 cars from this dealer and have referred a few friends resulting in 3 more sales.",4.8
1458,"September 03, 2009",I was pleased with the promptness of service and friendliness. Vidal made a point to make himself available. Bijan was wonderful to work with. He was patient and kind. I feel comfortable knowing that if I have any issues that I can go back to them for help. ,4.8
1459,"September 01, 2009","After a very long day sitting in a pushy and not super friendly dealership down the street, my husband and I decided to hit one more dealership. Vidal greeted us immediately with a huge smile on his face, ready to serve. I personally felt comfortable talking with him from that very first moment. He took us straight to the Mazda 3 that we had been searching for and laid out all of the details of the car very clearly. At the other dealership I felt that we had to ask a question about every little thing just to learn a little bit about the car, but Vidal helped us know if this was the right car for us or not by sharing as much information that he could. I appreciate his friendliness and willingness to be patient with us as first time buyers. We had never financed before and were a little weary, but he allowed us time to make the decision as our own decision... there was no pushing involved and that is a big reason I would recommend this dealership. All of the salesmen were all smiles everytime they walked by and if we ever needed anything they were willing to guide us and help us out. Vidal and his manager did everything they could to help us get the best APR (which is tough as first time financers) and keep our payments at what we needed them to be. Thanks, Vidal... we LOVE our new Mazda 3!!",5.0
1460,"August 31, 2009","It was a very good experience. Servando tried very hard to meet our needs and make us a deal that we felt good about. Both he and Bijan were not pushy, and there was no back and forth nonsense with a ""manager."" When we felt it waa unfair to pay for extras, Servando quicky saw what he could do to accommodate us and help. I felt that they understood our financial situation and didn't press us into something we could not afford. I felt that Servando cared enough to get me into the car that would suit my needs, at a fair price. He seemed genuinely friendly and I will recommend him to my friends and co-workers with confidence.",4.2
1461,"August 28, 2009","I purchased my Prius near the end of the cash-for-clunkers program, when all demand and prices went up (I was out of town beforehand so it was simply bad timing).  Fortunately, I found an ""unwind"" that was exact model/colors I wanted, and since it was an unwind it did not qualify for cash-for-clunkers, thereby allowing me to try for it as I didn't have a trade-in.  DCH Toyota is highly rated and I found all of the employees very helpful.  Jeff Johnson worked tirelessly on the deal.  My main problem was that I'd asked why the vehicle was returned by the previous owner (it had a mere 342 miles on it).  The reason I was given was the same from all 3 employees I asked - they all referred to a woman owner and that she couldn't secure credit.  CarFax showed no records either so I figured it was fine.  Turns out once I got home there was an invoice in the glove compartment outlining minor body work that had been done under the front bumper.  If its under $500 it doesn't get reported to DMV, so that's why CarFax showed no report.  Needless to say that's when I called the General Manager, Nick, who is quite helpful.  My main concern is that the dealer was not straightforward in the deal, and the fact that all 3 salespeople I spoke to had the exact same line which might indicate this was the agreed upon line, likely given by management.  I didn't mind the car having minor bodywork but not telling me makes it harder for me to bargain a fair price.  I also feel like I gave them my honest info, credit check, $11,000 downpayment, etc...  I was straightforward, so I would expect a dealer of this stature to do so as well.  Its also not clear that the mis-representation of the unwind was intentional.  To their credit, Nick D. took care of the issue and was accountable by giving me 2 years/25,000 miles of free maintenance at any Toyota dealer.  I would have rated higher on ""quality of work"" but there were some minor issues getting me my temporary registration paperwork and LoJack installation had a technical snag with its timely online registration, but in the end this was all resolved, its just that it took a bit of follow-up by me to make certain.  Otherwise they would get a 5 here as well.  I'm also skeptical about the window etching as a theft deterrent.  I did buy it at $300 and it was explained to me that they etch their entire fleet.  In retrospect I might have avoided the cost even though it was on the invoice.  21st Century Insurance only gave me a discount for the LoJack, not the etching, so I wonder how effective or proven it is.  I also give high marks for their Finance Dept, Bill Greene, who was very good to work with overall and made sure my deal went through to my credit union's financing.  ",4.8
1462,"August 24, 2009","I always dread going to car lots.  The back and forth game and knowing deep down they don't care about you and they just want to sell a car.  Our experience was so different dealing at DCH of Simi and especially with our salesman Servando Gomez.  Management must be really big on customer service because Servando really went above and beyond to accommodate us.  We also enjoyed dealing with Toyota Tim for our financing.  They were helpful, caring, funny, and professional.  The experience was so different than what I am used to. I will definitely go back and recommend them.

Thank you everyone at DCH Toyota

1463,"August 23, 2009","We were interested in a new SUV that allowed us to turn in our old one for the CARS program, so we first called the dealership to check what they have. Servando (our car dealer) checked the lot and came up with a few different options in our price range, so we visited the shop and he showed us the various vehicles. We found a Highlander that we absolutely loved and were even able to trim $500 off the sticker price so we can get the monthly payments we could afford. Servando was friendly the entire time, patient with us as we had to run home to find some paperwork for the CARS program, and he even helped us get CDs out of our old vehicle which had been stuck there for months when it had first stopped working. Overall we were very impressed with this dealership and I don't see how the service could have been better than it already was, an excellent experience!",5.0

Servando immediately greeted me with a warm smile and a hearty handshake. He made me feel very comfortable and secure, which played a big part in my decision factor to buy from DCH. He is kind, courteous, knowledgeable and did not make me feel an ounce of pressure into buying. He answered all of my questions and was easy to get a hold of f I had additional questions. He worked hard to reserve and get my truck to me in a very timely fashion and I appreciate the effort he made for me. :)
The whole process including going over the manuals, the signing of documents, and such forth, was fast, painless, and easy...and was explained to me thoroughly. 
I am satisfied with the overall price of everything.

THE CAR I BOUGHT FROM DCH  SIMI VALLEY WAS A 4RUNNER SPORT EDITION WITH 4 WHEEL DRIVE
MY EXPERIENCE WITH JASON WAS POSITIVE. I BOUGHT THE CAR YESTERDAY BUT HAD TO GO BACK TODAY AS THERE WAS DAMAGE TO THE CHROME GRILL.JASSON STATED HE WOULD WRITE A WORK ORDER SO THE REPAIR COULD BE DONE.I APPRECIATED HOW HE LOOKED AT THE SITUATION AND FOUND A FAIR SOLUTION.
JASON WAS THE FIRST SALES PERSON I MET AT THE DEALERSHIP AND ALWAYS TREATED ME WELL. JASON WOULD ACKNOWLEDGE WHEN HE DID NOT HAVE AN ANSWER RATHER THAN  TRY AND FAKE AN ANSWER. I RESPECT WHEN SOMEONE WILL ADMIT WHEN THEY DO NOT KNOW SOMETHING.ALSO HOW HE HANDLED THE PROBLEM WITH THE CHROME GRILL WAS VERY POSITIVE.  HE
NEVER PUT PRESSURE ON ME TO BUY A CAR AND JUST SPOKE OPENLY ABOUT THE COST OF THE CAR.
DANNY SCOTT WAS ANOTHER INTERESTING BUT POSITIVE EXPERIENCE.HE TRIED VERY HARD TO BE OPEN REGARDING THE COSTS 
OF THE TWO DIFFERENT CARS I WAS INTERESTED IN AND ACTUALLY WENT OUT OF HIS WAY TO GET A CAR FROM ANOTHER DEALER FOR ME.THE DEAL ALMOST DID NOT HAPPEN AS I COULD NOT FIND MY TITLE FOR THE CASH FOR CLUNKERS PROGRAM.DANNY WAS FAIR AND GAVE ME TIME TO FIND THE TITLE WHICH I EVENTUALLY DID.HE ALSO WAS A STRAIGHT SHOOTER
WHICH I APPRECIATED FROM THE  START.
ALSO DEALT WITH GUS,IN SALES, WHO WAS PROFESSIONAL IN ADDITION,THE FINANCE OFFICER I DEALT WITH WAS ALSO FAIR AND PLEASANT  DURING THE TRANSACTION.

1469,"August 16, 2009","Savono was fantastic from the first time I reached him on the phone.  I was searching for a Prius, and having a lot of difficulty finding one, as cash for clunkers is in its 3rd week (8/16/09).  This dealership had just received my basic Prius III the night before.  

I was very happy with their assurance that they charged msrp - no extra even though the car was in such demand, and no haggling -- I was tired of that after a week and a half of haggling with other dealerships.  

I left the dealership I had just driven 45 minutes to get to just to discover they had sold the car that the salesman had talked me into considering (more extras, marked up and little wiggle room.  

I met with Savano right away and since I had pretty much decided, I wanted that prius, even though it wasn't my first color choice.  Savono walked me through the process and made it easy and painless.

1472,"August 05, 2009","Bought a new Sienna CE from this dealership after struggling to find a fair-minded dealer with a fair price. Spent more than a week doing research on the car, calling/visiting different dealers to locate the car, and finding a salesperson who took the time to communicate. It was extremely difficult to find a reasonable dealer at this time, for the KLUNKER program turned the car market in to a SELLER's MARKET. 

I called Simi Valley dealership knowing it might be my last stop before deciding on a different make/model or settling for a BLACK color Sienna. Thom was straight forward from the beginning and didn't want to push for something he wanted. He listened well, and understood what the buyer wanted perfectly.

1475,"July 26, 2009","I had researced the 2010 Prius for about 8 months as I planned to replace my 10 year old Mazda MPV Van for my wife.  My wife wanted the Barcelonia Red color and I wanted the Prius 11 model. ""The Clunkers Car"" program was launced on July 24th and I wanted to take advantage of that program as well.  I called DCH Toyota on Monday July 20th and Vidal answered the phone.  I asked him if he had the car in stock and he said he did.  I said ""I'll be right down to take a look."" I drove to the dealership and Vidal gave me a tour in the car with myself driving and I loved the car.  Vidal was very knowledgeable of the car and explained and answered all my questions.  We went back into the showroom and Vidal went through all the paperwork with me for the sale, but I had to wait until Friday July 24th before I could take delivery as that was the first day the program would be launched.  On Friday I came back with my wife and Vidal had the car all washed and detailed and ready for pick up.  We completed the sale with ease and then Vidal took us out and gave us a complete run-down from A to Z as to the car. Vidal was very curtious to my wife in helping her hook up her IPOD which other than the color red, was all she cared about with the car.  I also was very pleased with ""Bejan"" the finance manager at DCH.  He was very easy to work with and explained all the financial matters very clearly.  I purchased both the extended warrenty and maintenance for the first 11 5000 mile checkups.

My best friend was thrilled with the car, and I'm sure my will be, too. I have had two other hybrid cards in the past, including a first generation Prius. It is hard to describe how much more fun it is to drive a hybrid, rather than a simple piston engine.

He gave us a great tour and service that surprised us.  We shaked hands and left and promised he'd be helping us on our next car.

Guess what, this morning my wife brought up the idea to trade in our old car (well, she wants to smell the new car).  Toyota is always our first choice for their reliability, quality and price.

What I had gathered from all the other dealerships was because the prius was so popular they were all marking the car over the sticker price.  The thing was that I called all these other dealerships and asked them if they were marking the car up they all said no.  Then I came into the dealership and they sprung the markup on me.  To say the least I got up and walked out on all of them.  I still wanted a prius so I called Toyota of Simi Valley.  I  asked for sales and got transfered to a man named Russ.  Russ was very friendly and answered all of my questions.  He actally got me excited to come in and see the car.  Before I came in I asked him if they were asking for over the sticker price on the prius.  This is when Russ, not knowing it, earned my buisness.  He told me the truth, something no other dealership had done.  Imagine that.  He told me they were, but also said he wanted to make sure I got the right car for me, and he would be more than happy to present any offer I was willing to make to his sales manager.  After that I knew I had to come in and meet with Russ.  Upon meeting Russ I realized he was a young man..about mid twenties and he told me he had been in the car buisness for about a year.  I went on a test drive and came into talk numbers.  Russ and another salesman by the name of Oleg walked me through the sale, and I actually got the Prius for the price I wanted to Pay.  It was seriously the best experience I have ever had with a car dealership, and I wanted to let erveryone know about it.  So on behalf of my family thank you Russ you were amazing. Also thank you Toyota of Simi Valley.  As long as Russ is there you have a customer for life.",1.6
