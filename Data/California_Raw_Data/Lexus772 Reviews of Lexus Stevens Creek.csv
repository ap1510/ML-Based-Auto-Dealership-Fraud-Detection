1,"August 13, 2019","I recently purchased a RX350 and worked with Jay. He is beyond awesome, extremely professional. He took his time to explain everything to us.  I loved the fact and he wasn’t pushy like some other car salesmen. Excellent customer service. Robert Riley (finance manager) was also very nice and took his time to explain every single paper I was singing.  I never had good experience with car dealerships but these two gentlemen made me change my mind.  Thank you so much Jay and Robert ",5.0

6,"September 13, 2018","This was my first time taking my  2007 IS250 in for a replacement of the Takata airbag on the dashboard (a recall item). I just recently purchased this vehicle and inherited the issue at hand. I had an appointment at 10:00 am. When I arrived, I waited in the waiting room for a service consultant to assist me with my vehicle,  When we finally met, I felt he did not greet me with a sincere welcoming.  As we discussed the issues of my vehicle in his office, I felt that his assistance was insincere and rushed.  When we walked outside to my vehicle, I noticed he veered off to a different direction to go greet another customer in their vehicle with a hand shake with a smile.  Overall, I was not impressed with this Service consultant assistance.  This will be my first and last time taking my vehicle to Steven's Creek Lexus Service Department.",1.8
7,"June 05, 2018","Working with Herman has been my absolute best car buying experience.  He was very helpful and informative. He explained my options thoroughly and made me a very good deal. He was considerate about my time and even had my car detailed and ready before I was done signing the paperwork! 
When my lease term approaches the end, I hope I have the opportunity to work with Herman again.

8,"June 03, 2018","At first I was not sure I wanted another RX350.  It would be my forth and I was not that enchanted with the new body style. I got my prior vehicle from Herman Samaniego at Stevens Cr eek Lexus, I had a professional experience dealing with him. So I contacted Herman when my lease mileage was getting close to my limit even though I had six month remaining on my lease.  Herman explained my options and told me he would contact me when it made sense.  When it was time I set an appointment with Herman and he knew what I was looking for in the vehicle (color and equipment) and he had it waiting for us to look at and test drive.  Herman reviewed the differences between by prior and the new vehicle. He went over the new features and how they worked. In the end we made one change going from the RX350 to the Hybrid RX450H.  When my lease comes up in 4 years I will check in again with Herman.

Sincerely,

Barry L. Baltor

9,"May 23, 2018","This is my second time getting a car! and the experience was excellent as last time! I got to work with Domingo which I wasn't sure how it will turn out since I worked with different person last time. And guess what! Domingo is so great!! He is very understanding what I need and he even remember me back 3 years ago too. Those small attention to detail really matter to me come to car buying. He has great knowledge about cars and that is also plus for the question I have.  I will definitively come back future!

It is my second time working with Gary and I was happy that they assign me to him again, and He also has great knowledge and even remember me back 3 years ago make me feel very warm welcome!  Gary made the boring paper work seem very fun with good talks! 

Overall, Lexus Stevens Creek did very well with pairing people up and know how to treat return customer well! and I can say I will come back for future! ",5.0

All the process was smooth and easy. Herman looked for several options which could be interested to me and helped with the right choice. Made it super easy to transfer from my current lease to a new one.
Financial part was also super easy, Jennifer completed all the paper work and explained me all the questions I had.
Over all great experience this time. I wish I had same experience for the first purchase.

26,"November 20, 2017","We have been loyal, Lexus of Stevens Creek, customers for over 28 years.  In our opinion, and supported by personal experience, the sales and service staff are true professionals.  They are well trained, competent, personable and, above all, dedicated to insuring complete customer satisfaction.  While we agree that the Lexus product is of high quality, it is the Stevens Creek employees that make us return to the agency on a regular basis. During the past 7 to 12 years we have been assisted by two outstanding representatives, Herman Samaniego (sales) and Anita Clevenger (finance).  These exceptional employees have provided us with both courtesy and continuity.  It's reassuring and comfortable working with familiar faces for so many years. Visit this agency.  You won't be disappointed! ",5.0
27,"November 11, 2017","Wow! This isn't what we expected from a luxury brand. Just had a terrible terrible experience at this dealership with a sales manager named Neil Chandra. He was condescending, rude, manipulative, uninformed. Just a shady character. The dealership itself seems nice. We were seen quickly and has a decent experience till Neil started to try and give us the hard sell to make the sale. Insisting that he could only give us the 'best' price after he had run our credit. After I showed him that the Lexus website publicly advertised a better rate than he was showing us. He started obfuscating about how they were advertising a different vehicle. We are going to buy a Lexus but definitely not at this dealership and not with Neil Chandra.",1.0

30,"November 03, 2017","Hey I just wanted to share my experience with Stevens Creek Lexus since it was great.

I had been looking for a LX570 that fit my budget since it would be an offroad vehicle used for towing and playing.  A long time Toyota fan and owner of 7 Tundras, a Sequoia and 2 Tacomas, I decided to try the LX570 over the Land Cruiser.  I've been very happy with my vehicle choice and the service from Lexus is outstanding.  Sam had a great attitude and was very easy to work with and complete the deal.  This was the fastest car buying experience I have ever had with no games or back and forth.  There were a couple items service took care of after I purchased my LX and the service team was as amazing as the sales team.  In and out of there quickly and they went above and beyond to overnight the parts so I could be on my way the next day.

Thanks again to Sam and Todd for making my first Lexus experience so great.",5.0

34,"September 09, 2017","My wife and I wish to express our appreciation of the excellent service extended to us by Herman Samaniego, who is the Portfolio Manager at Lexus of Stevens Creek in San Jose, CA.  He went out of his way to find the perfect RX350 with the specific features to fit our particular situation and needs.  Herman carefully listened to us and provided the rare extra personal attention not always available when one shops for a car.  Herman exhibited sensitivity and professionalism in helping us through every step of the process of finding and acquiring a new car. This is the second opportunity we have had to work with Herman, and he always turns what can be at times a stressful exercise into a pleasurable experience.  Lexus of Stevens Creek is indeed fortunate to have Herman on its staff.  ",5.0

He took the time to understand what are the must-have features in a car, the pricing, color etc. and found us the best matched vehicle within our budget.  Herman was very attentive and caring!  He made sure he avoided bumps on the road during the test drive that would aggravate any pain from an injury my wife had sustained from a recent accident.  Herman also personally delivered the car to our house, set up the home link, mobile phones, etc.

47,"March 22, 2017","I don't think they are a good service. The only thing I see it good there is coffee and water during waiting for my  car. However, I was waiting over 3 hours only in for maintence service  5k miles. I bought new car around 4months the tire defect but I did not know. I did bump in the curb but the impact the tire shouldn't be a big tore multiple places. I also showed them another area that I did not hit, still has little crack. This tire is defected before I hit the curb but  they denial, that my fault. They are careless what I tried to tell them. One manage talked to me and tell me stop to listen to him. I am so frustrated and feel disappointed the way he  were handling the issue. I thought they stand for the product they sold to customers but they don't. I never buy Lexus again for sure. ",1.2
48,"March 16, 2017","Walked into Lexus of Stevens Creek and met Joe Minster, a polite and welcoming sales consultant. He was extremely efficient with my time (which I absolutely appreciated) and asked a few baseline questions to understand my needs. Following our brief discussion Joe immediately took me to see a handful of his vehicles that best matched my description, not trying to upsell one over the other. What impressed me most was Joe’s detailed knowledge of each vehicle, incl the specific features and variances from one model year to the next. He could even point out specific flaws (if any existed) and recited a description of the vehicle’s history and time on the lot. It was obvious he took the time to study each vehicle inside & out, which relieved me from feeling the need to go over the entire vehicle with a microscopic lens. From test drive to purchase, Joe was completely professional and accommodating. During negotiations he was direct and honest, ensuring I was made to feel comfortable. This was my first luxury vehicle purchase and I have Joe Minster along with the rest of the Lexus of Stevens Creek staff to thank for making it a memorable experience. Thank You Joe!",5.0

Obviously the first time was smooth enough that when I found myself in need again, I went straight back to Herman.

51,"February 21, 2017","We were at the tail-end of our first lease and had decided that we were going to just buy our leased RX because it had been such a great car.  Plus, we didn't love the look of the new grills.  But in his excellent non-pushy way, Herman offered to tell us a bit about the safety features of the new RX.  When we said that we were likely to just buy our leased car, he didn't pressure us one way or the other.  But since we were there, he wondered if we'd like to take a look at the new cars (and who doesn't like to look at new cars).  So even though we had no intention of getting a new car, he was willing to spend lots of time with us and share his strong knowledge about the car's features.  It came down to a decision between buying our old car and exactly one specific RX hybrid--Herman found that car for me in two days, and we are now the delighted the car and the fantastic service we received from Herman!  And dealing with Anita for the lease documents was also a great pleasure.  Both are a credit to Lexus!",5.0

I had come in previously a year ago looking for the same car, but was unable to decide on which one to buy and was reluctant to take on a car payment even though Stephen was able to help  me find something within my price range & need. This year I started the process of looking for, looking at, & buying the car and finished in 1 day. I went home happily with a CT Hybrid in a color that I loved with the bells and whistles that I was looking for thanks to Stephen!

I heard positive feedback from friends and colleagues about Stevens Creek Lexus so I decided to check it out. When I walked into the dealership Stephen was very welcoming and began to ask me what I was looking for. I gave him numbers and he admitted they were pretty aggressive, but he was willing to work with me. Took out an IS 200T F-Sport with navigation and immediately fell in love.

62,"December 05, 2016","Yesterday I leased my 4th car from Lexus at Stevens Creek. This was my third car from Herman Samaniego having leased my first car from Brian Crocker, who is still there in a different role. 
(Brian always makes it a point to stop by to say hello and chat with me. :) )
It says something about a company who has long time employees.
My husband thinks it's crazy for me to drive the 80 mile round trip when there are at least two dealerships closer to us. But it is rare to find a place that is so friendly and has ""the heart"" that they do for their clients. 
The dealership itself is always bright, airy and immaculate. Tis a great place to get a car for sure...

64,"November 28, 2016","We were soured and unhappy with our Lexus after the horrible experience we had at another dealership in Redwood City. We had a CT 200 that was ready for early lease return. It was in mint condition with extremely low mileage. The other dealership we went to held me hostage for 4 hours while a revolving door of salesman came in to try to explain why I wasn't getting the deal they committed to over the phone. I left there feeling beaten and angry. I was convinced it was the car and not the dealership and decided I wouldn't lease another Lexus. Then, a friend suggested I try Stevens Creek Lexus. I went into the dealership, having had a short conversation with Herman Samaniego a few days prior. Wow! What service and integrity. Not only was this dealership night and day from Redwood City, it turned out it indeed was the dealership and not the car. We left with a brand new car with a payment that met our budget and a car that met our status. We were thrilled at how lovely and easy the transaction went. Herman was outstanding! I cannot begin to even tell you how wonderful buying a car from him was. He mapped out all the cars similar to the one we were looking at and did a breakdown in cost for us to review. Anita explained the deal to us in full detail and we were able to ask questions for clarity if something was confusing. Herman took our picture, held our hands and made sure we had an amazing experience. All this on Black Friday! Thank you so much for changing our minds about Lexus. We love this dealership and think everyone should buy their Lexus from Stevens Creek! When you do, say hello to Anita and Herman from us~ The new owners of an NX Turbo! Beep Beep!",4.8

The test drive was a pleasure as Herman knew the function of every button and control in the car and was barraged with non-stop questions during the drive.. The financing was carefully explained and comparisons on different pricing options were discussed very simply.  A pleasure to deal with Herman.

83,"September 29, 2016","Update (scroll down for original review):

I received a response to my review from the dealership, asking me to contact the Fixed Ops Director & Parts Manager, Andy Aguilar, to follow up on my experience.

Over a couple phone calls and emails, Andy quickly got to the bottom of this, and 2 weeks later, I received a check for the entire amount of the repair. Andy was efficient, professional but friendly, and great to work with. If I had been working with Andy from the beginning, this definitely wouldn't have dragged on for half a year.

I'd give Andy 5 stars. Taking into account the first part of the whole experience, updating the review to 3 stars.

--- ORIGINAL REVIEW ---

Avoid this service center at all cost. Here's my story.

Brought my (almost) brand new Lexus GS with 1,000 miles for some minor adjustments. Got a call hours later from service advisor Chet Mielcarz that the front bumper was damaged in their care, possibly by the technician doing a test drive. He kindly sent me two pictures of the damage.

The dealership offered to make repairs at a body shop they worked with. Unfortunately, I had very negative prior experiences with the body shop (they neglected to reinstall all the wheel lug nuts -- a MAJOR safety oversight, not to mention paint mismatch and clear coat over-spray onto most of the windshield). After repeated negotiation with Todd Rebhan, the service manager, the dealership still refused to allow me to bring my car to an established, reputable body shop in the area. I had no choice but to proceed with my own insurance.

Fast forward a few months, my insurance reported back that Todd had refused to admit fault to the damage, claiming that the dealership only offered to repair the damage out of courtesy. This was despite the fact that Chet and Todd both mentioned verbally that the damage was likely caused by a technician and that the paperwork showed my car was damage-free when I brought it in.

I contacted Lexus corporate, who promptly followed up with the dealership. Unfortunately, Todd repeated the same excuse and refused to admit fault. Since then, the Lexus corporate contact has been unable to reach Todd for a week at the time of this writing.

Accidents do happen at dealership service centers. All I was looking for was the honesty to admit fault, but the dealership would rather avoid a small repair bill that they had offered to pay for via another body shop anyway.

A dealership that would sacrifice customer trust to avoid the bill on a small bumper repair should be avoided at all cost.",3.0

In addition, he was smiling the entire time...a sign of an individual who truly enjoys his profession!

Prior walking away Stephen offered to show me the NX200 FSport model which came with red interior with white exterior. I was sold the moment I saw the red interior - the color was just stunning....exact ""red"" I was looking for.  To cut the story short - I brought the car! Stephen was superb! He wasn't the typical ""pushy"" salesman - he treated me as ""friend"" instead of a ""customer""! Very presssional and knowledgeable all around!

89,"September 07, 2016","This rating is for Nate Persall. I will try to be very objective in this review and will let you judge if I was treated fairly or not. 

I went to test drive a car last week, and Nate happened to be the person who we bumped into on the parking lot. 

So he brings us in with a big smile and asks us what we are looking for. I tell him that I am looking for a Lexus NX, and would like to test drive one. And then the first question he asks is when I am looking to buy the car, and I said a week perhaps if I like it and once I have test driven a couple of other models. Fair question, right? And I could visibly see his interest level drain. Even more apparent was his reluctance to let me test drive increased exponentially. 

Nate did not let me take the car on the freeway, as apparently he will do so only if I decided to take the car home that day, just before signing the paper. Really? Every other dealership I went to on Stevens Creek including Volvo and Acura let me drive the car on the freeway and you won't let me till I promise to sign on the dotted line?

Also, when Nate asked how would I like to pay for this car (i.e., lease or finance), and I mentioned I would like to buy it, he said, and I paraphrase, 'Oh! I thought you would be leasing this."" Really Nate, what makes you assume I am unable to pay for a Lexus? Please do tell. 

Oh, and finally, if you have ever test driven a car, you know they give you a printout with the estimate per month pricing etc. Nate refused to give that to us as apparently he cannot justify this to his managers! 

I am sorry Lexus Stevens Creek that you are employing such an unprofessional and rude sales associate as Nate Persall. It's been a long time since I have been treated this badly by a sales rep and if you claim to be a winner of the ""consumer satisfaction award"", you should at least treat every customer fairly and with respect and dignity. And I hope you will employ sales rep more professional than Nate, as he is clearly not one.

108,"July 17, 2016","I have been a Lexus owner for over a decade and have getting my cars only serviced at Lexus dealerships. My most recent experience(s) at the Lexus of Stevens Creek in Santa Clara, CA have been the best because of my amazing service advisor Mr. Paymon Khajavi! As we know all visits to the dealer, seeking answers to concerns may not be good news, as It wasn't for me on 6/12/16 when a routine oil change service turned out to be a major repair based on an timing chain and an oil leak!
Mr. Khajavi did an amazing job explaining the issue in detail and offered different solutions. The cost of the repair was almost $4000, but based on his honesty and sincerety I decided to have the repairs done at Lexus vs. another mechanic for much less in cost! The repairs were done as promised and I was very happy!
On a different occasion, this past Friday 7/16/16, I experienced another issue with my car related to the alternater and battery. I had to get my car towed to Lexus of Stevens creek over night and left a note in it explaining the problem and asked Mr. Khajavi to contact me. To my surprise, Mr. Khajavi called me the next day at 7:09 a.m, letting me know he has the car and will have an update for me by mid day on what was going on. Despite that day's heavy workload, he worked quickly to secure a loaner car for me so I can make it to work on time. He contacted me by mid day as promised and told me the alternater and the battery have both failed and the cost of this repair would be $1000...Again only based on the trust I have with Paymon, I approved for the work to be done, regardless of being able to have it done by an outside mechanic for half the price...Why???? Because Paymon has built an awesome professional and trusting relationship with me and I would continue to get my car serviced there as long as he works at Lexus of Stevens Creek! He's always welcoming and friendly and takes full interest in hearing your concern and is very quick and efficient in responding!
Please recognize Mr. Khajavi for his amazing customer service skills and commitment! Your company is lucky and privileged to have Mr. Khajavi representing it! Thank You Paymon!",5.0

110,"July 11, 2016","I went into the dealership on Saturday ready to have a panic attack.  I hadn't purchased a vehicle in over 15 years and I dreaded going through the entire process again.  However, this experience was so unlike any of my previous purchases.  Joe Hart was extremely helpful throughout.  I expected to have to haggle back and forth on the sales price, but I didn't have to.  The vehicle Joe suggested for me after talking about budget had just the right set of options and the price Joe gave me was right on target the first time. (I'd been doing a lot of research on sales prices on RX 350s.)

The other point of anxiety for me was financing.  I already had a pre-approval from my credit union, but I figured I'd have to do a lot of work to get the purchase docs to the credit union so that they could cut a check which I'd then have to go back to the dealership to drop that off.  Not the case this time.  Gary in finance was able to confirm the pre-approval and worked some magic to get the loan with my credit union finalized and all I had to do was write a check for the down payment.

I drove out of that dealership with my new vehicle without any of the post purchase anxiety I was expecting and so far I'm very pleased with my new ""Dreadnought"" (that's what I've named it). Thanks, Joe and Gary!",5.0

If the auto industry is looking for a clone this is your model. Thanks Joe for a great experience.,5.0
132,"June 04, 2016","In shopping for my current vehicle, I visited half a dozen dealerships in the area and Ryan Schrantz is by far the most knowledgeable car sales I came across. I was particularly interested in the advanced safety technologies available on the new vehicles. Not only does Ryan know inside out how they function, he has also tested all of them himself, with first hand knowledge of how they behave under different circumstances. He even recommended against getting one of the technologies due to its limited utility under realistic driving conditions. Even though I owned a Lexus and like Lexus cars in general, I didn't initially set my mind on getting another one. It was really after meeting Ryan that I seriously began to consider getting another Lexus because I wanted to buy a car from him! Thank you Ryan (and Lena) for making my car buying experience smooth and enjoyable. ",4.8

He followed through on your needs and save your time.  You shop the best price, bring it to him in person, with proof. He will match it or beat it at Lexus of Stevens Creek dealer with his boss's approval?
He also is a very patient guy.  For instance, my toddler 3 yrs old insisted and cried to go test drive with me.  He waited for me to transfer a baby car seat on a new car.  Clearly answered to you when you have questions and walked through with you on getting started owning/ driving a new car.
Gary Luu was efficiently on your finance paperwork and explained manufacture coverage and extended warranty options for your purchase.
Bonus: As a new Lexus owner at Stevens Creek dealer, you will get a FREE lifetime of Valet parking at the Valley Fair shopping mall with a Stevens Creek license plate frame and your VIN #.  I highly recommend, prefer and count on Daniel Marcias for your next car.",5.0

147,"May 19, 2016","Met Ryan when I was doing Internet search on Lexus sedans. Explained what I was looking for and the budget I had to work within. Ryan found cars I that met my requirements and I scheduled a visit for a test ride. Ryan was never the typical pushy car salesman. Listened to my needs and actually put me in more car than I thought I could afford for less than I had budgeted for. Took wife in to make final decision and to ride in the ES350 he had found for me. We were in and out of the dealership in less than three hours with a new Lexus ES350.
Wife happened to mention she liked the RX350 and what she would want in it if she bought one. Ryan called her that evening and told her he found three she might like in the budget restraints she had put down. We scheduled a time for her to go in on Saturday. She found the RX350 she liked and he got her top dollar for her trade in and we left with a new RX350 for her below her budget restrants. 
Ryan knows his cars and listens to your desires, but never pressures you on anything. He presents the facts and you make the decision.

Started out to replace my Prius with a more comfortable and safer ride and ended up replacing both cars in our family with more comfortable and safer vehicles.

     Domingo was my my sales rep.  He was incredibly knowledgeable about the Lexus, being able to answer all of the questions I had.  He had great people skills, and though his job calls for negotiating, the way in which he proceeded with the negotiations was respectful of me.
      Even after I signed the paperwork, everyone at Lexus (Domingo, Robert in Finance, and the follow-up calls from customer service) was extremely kind and helpful.  Lexus of Stevens Creek definitely has the motto of customer 1st, customer care, and customer follow-up.
     When one thinks of ""the finance department"", one mY not usually think of a pleasant experience, but Robert was great.  From the moment I saw him, he had a smile on his face, a pep in his step, and a joyful tone in his voice.  As with the sales end, Robert is bound to offer some of their add ons like a protective coating or an extended warranty, but he was brief yet thorough, and he respected my decision and dealt with me pleasantly.

After I decided to buy, Herman carefully walked me through the features which can be daunting but he took the time and was very patient with me as I tend to not be very technology literate. Herman even came out to my home to help me link my car to the garage door opener after I screwed that up. In 10 min he had it all fixed and all was good. 

Anita is such a pleasure to do business with. So calming and so nice, she feels like family when we are all done the paperwork. Since I have purchased cars there before I actually told her I feel like I am coming home to family. I trust her to give me a fair but good deal and she explains all this in a tone that is very calming and not challenging in any way like other dealerships. here long tenure with Lexus allows her to answer any question or explain my options very efficiently and she is fantastic at giving advice on what she would do given a choice of options.

We have always taken our 2008 RX 350 to them since we purchased the car used in 2009.  Their service is always impeccable and I have never felt like they tried to take advantage of us while the car was on the ""rack"", unlike other dealers and mechanics I have experienced.

The water pump malfunctioned while driving on the freeway causing the engine to break down.  We had the car towed to their service center and they proactively convinced the manufacturer to cover the entire cost of replacing the water pump and engine.  

The car only has 50,000 miles but because of its age, is out of warranty.  They did not have to do this and we would have had no recourse but they did so because we have been loyal customers and they recognized it was not our fault.  

Customer service is a dying art in the U.S. but not at Lexus Stevens Creek.  They have a customer for life and I will continue to sing their praises to all of my friends and relatives.",5.0

200,"March 05, 2016","Lexus Stevens Creek Service didn't track and manage my 2015 Rx350 case. With a scheduled appointment for my Rx350 engine system noise problem, I brought my car to Lexus Stevens Creek Service at 7am on Nov. 7th, 2015. Service Adviser Carlos Munoz met me and handled the appointment. A technician spent about an hour with me to diagnose the noise problem. He test-drove my car, measured the engine idle speed (the RPM was normal), and compared my car's noise with another Rx 350 (which had similar mileage to mine) and one Lexus 350 sedan. Apparently, my car's noise was higher. He also opened the hood and listened my car's engine directly. The engine itself was quiet but we did heard the noise at the front seats. At the end, Carlos told me two things: (1) Stevens Creek Service wouldn't be able to do anything with the noise problem and will pass the case to the Lexus manufacture and (2) Stevens Creek Service would follow up the noise problem again at 5000 miles maintenance after the car system further ""broke in"". I did request Carlos to record the noise problem and investigation result, and Carlos promised to do so. 

By the time at the 5000 miles maintenance on Feb. 6, I learned that the noise problem and my scheduled problem check on Nov. 7th was not on Stevens Creek Service's work record and the Service Schedule had ""no show"" on my Nov. 7th appointment record. And there was no record for my previous visit and associated technician work for the same problem in October 2015 either. 

I communicated the situation of customer case mishandling to a service manager (Todd Rebhan) in person at Stevens Creek Service as well as to the service manager and Carlos Munoz in email, requesting documenting the missing case. There has been no result.

Once I reached out to him, his customer service was very welcoming. This was important to me because I wasn't looking to talk to a shark who has bad motives. He asked the right questions and gave me some options/recommendations on what could possibly work for me. We scheduled a one-on-one appointment to review the cars to see which one I would like. From there we did a test drive, showed me the features, and gave me some history about Lexus. Although I wasn't ready to buy the first day I met, we exchanged information and kept it contact. I had many questions, but Herman promptly responded and helped me out as much as possible. The next time I went with him, we went over numbers and looked out for my best interest since they a great rate/incentive going on. He made everything work in my favor and I left the dealership with a 2016 Lexus IS 200t in my favorite color (Sonic Blue Mica), which is a very hard color to find out here.

207,"February 26, 2016","We just purchased what is essentially a new 2015 RX 350. Why do I say essentially? Because it was one of several of the dealership's loaner cars it makes available for sale each year around this time. Given all the recalls underway we had to have a tried and true car for my wife and newborn so we naturally turned to Lexus. Our new barely used car is in tip top shape and comes with a 6 year UNLIMITED MILEAGE warranty. That's something. The definition of faith in a brand and the automobile right there.

But enough about the car. When your salesman, Joe Hart, drives your car to your home to complete paperwork because we have a newborn, drives to and from the dealership to deliver said car during rush hour and has a smile on his face while doing so, I'd say he deserves a positive review and then some. Joe and Mike made purchasing our new family car a breeze and saved us so much time. Can't thank these guys enough and if our seven soon to be eight week old son could talk he'd do the same.

266,"October 05, 2015","first off I would like to say that the Lexus showroom is just absolutely
stunning. First appearances truly create the initial energy any person will
have when walking into a room and the way the Steven's Creek Lexus is set
up including the friendly greeters makes this place so inviting.


I had the pleasure of dropping by to look at vehicles on a night you guys
were hosting an event and what an event it was! As for my shopping
experience Numer Talag went above and beyond in meeting all of my
expectations. I can't express enough how exceptional the customer service
was. Car shopping unfortunately has a stigma that creates tension with the
customer when walking in to browse. You tell yourself that you have to keep
your guard up and be prepared to have to talk your way out of the
unnecessary. I can honestly say that I lost myself during the test drive.
Numer wasn't selling the vehicle alone, he was truly selling me the joy in
driving the vehicle. I could not stop laughing and smiling during my whole
experience from the test drive with Numer, to the outstanding talent of
Eddie Ghanim in the Finance area, down to the final signings with Robert
Riley. I was done by 10:30pm and I felt like I just made several lifelong
friends.


Not only did I leave with the most beautiful car but I left with the
guarantee of future successful purchases made by myself, friends and
colleagues. I cannot thank everyone at Lexus enough!",5.0

275,"September 24, 2015","As a gentleman beginning his early career in sales, Stephen demonstrates the exceptional ability to investigate what is in the customer's best interest. He clearly does his homework and presents favorable options that are elegant and affordable, but it does not end there. Seeking a new car as a first-time buyer was daunting. Nevertheless, Stephen sprinted the extra mile featuring the entire array of Lexus models (even the ones I could not afford) with key emphasis on their pros and cons. Furthermore, his exhibition of such cars instigated prospective insight as to what direction Lexus is headed towards in 2015-2016 (who is the target consumer,what technological advances have been made, has the price range shifted, etc.) Like any customer that appreciates being fully informed, I was able to make a strong, painless, and satisfied decision by the end of the day. 

I highly recommend Stephen Tran to customers that are either new or knowledgeable in selecting a a dream car.

I live in fremont where there's another lexus dealer 5 minutes away. I actually did swing by that dealer before going to stevens creek and the level of service and interaction was drastically different. I'd take the extra 25 minute drive to stevens creek any day. 

He's the most honest and sincere, truly finding what you're looking for and within your budget. He'll go above and beyond to meet your requests and to fit your needs.

279,"September 16, 2015","I have met and dealt with a few sale people at Stevens Creep Lexus over the years, but the absolute best and most professional and knowledgable was Ryan Schrantz.  He is the  internet salesperson and my purchasing experience was impressive.  He let us drive the car as much as we wanted to really experience the drive and quality of my new Lexus NXt.  He explained everything about the car twice and how to use the interior dials.  He told me who the best service representatives to see at the dealers service department near the airport. 

I also went to the Stevens Creek Mercedes-Benz where the salesman did not provide the information one needs to know, but I had to ask all of the questions.  He did not even ask if we wanted to take the car out for a test drive or want to show us his inventory on another lot.  He seemed not to know how to sell a car and convince the customer that this is the car for him.  

On the other hand Ryan has a lot of low key passion and he got me the best deal possible.  He is flexible and understanding and of course, no pressure.   I feel that I could trust him and I could be treated  with honesty and get a fair purchase price.  I recommended him to my neighbor whose son in interested in buying a Lexus GS.

296,"August 05, 2015",First things first I would Highly recommend Stephen Tran and also Robert Riley who works at lexus stevens creek. Before I have ever met Stephen at a dealership I have actually met him at the local RCF unveiling at Santana Row shopping center. Not knowing who he was and that he was a cars salesmen he approached we on how I liked the car and asked if I had any questions. So we kicked it off and started to talk about cars for a good hour in hobbies etc. From speaking with Stephen I can really understand that he has a love for cars and is really passionate unlike some others cars sales guy that are in it for the money. For a year I have kept coming back to Stevens Creek and when we come across each other who would be very polite and asked if I needed help although I wasn't ready to purchase a car yet offering drinks or test drives. This is usually rare because people who come to check cars but dont end up buying the sales guy usually flakes them off. (Plus towards Stephen) He really truly does car about the customers best interest in mind. Not using forced sales tactics and is very genuine about your needs and what do you really look for in a car. He is all about you in what you want when do you want it and how do you want it. I can see why Robert Riley who I had schedule appointments in the pass for my family and friends really recommended Stephen.

I walked in torn between a hybrid and non ES, and actually ended up testing driving both (twice for the hybrid). Where else can someone find such a great salesman? Most would have been rolling their eyes at this point. 

Throughout the long process (I swear we were there for half a day), Steven was unfailingly polite, patient, helpful and volunteered useful information. He'd actually considered the same cars I considered when making his car purchase so it was a very enlightening conversation. Steven made the process fun, painless and took care of every single small detail. He never tried to upsell me or push more expensive options on me. He listened carefully to the things I cared about and gave me honest opinions/answers. Steven is fluent in both English and Mandarin so he was able to answer the barrage of questions from my family as well. 10 days later, I'm very happy with my purchase and only hope that he never leaves this dealership.

Looking to buy a new car? Go to Steven.
Unsure hybrid vs conventional? Go to Steven.
Want to have a fun and great experience? Go to Steven.
Need a Mandarin speaker? Go to Steven.
Need a comparison of Lexus vs other brands? Go to Seven.

I highly recommend Celine. She's very nice, helpful and professional. She's not that kind of sales pushing you to buy everything. She analyze the gains and lost for different options and give her suggestion based on our case.",5.0

I am so glad that I had Domingo as salesperson. I would highly recommend him to anyone going to the dealership. I am surely going to him for my next car!

337,"May 18, 2015","Just got a brand new RC Coupe from Lexus Stevens Creek! Worked with Celine Bian, one of the best sales person I have ever met! She seemed to genuinely care about my requirements and not just about making the sale. The first time I walked in and told them I just completed school and wanted a new RC as my first car, I could sense the skepticism in their faces, but none the less, Celine was very friendly and took me on a test drive. The car was as good as I had imagined it would be. Celine took the time to explain all the features of the car. 

Since I had no credit of my own and didn't want a co-signer on my lease, I had almost decided to give up pursuing this car when Celine did the research and got back to me with a possibility I could still get the car. Unlike most sales people, she limited her texts/calls/emails and never annoyed me with too many of them. I went to another dealer because they had the exact car I wanted and got a deal that I was actually happy with. Celine promised me that she would do her best for me if I went back to her. I didn't think it would help but I was really happy I did because she cut the price by 8% more on top of what the other dealer already did! Even her colleagues couldn't believe she got me such a great deal!

One final problem arose because of the fact that I wanted a special color - Delivery only after 10 days. However, I explained to Celine that I wanted the car as soon as possible since I did not have any other way of commute and she was able to make arrangements for the car to be delivered within 5 days! She even helped me with my applications and was there with me till I drove off with the car. Overall, I'd say one of the best service I've gotten in US! Buying a new car wasn't half as bad as I imagined it'd be!

For my next car, the Lexus LFA, I know who I'm going to! :)",5.0

341,"May 12, 2015","We couldn't have been happier with our new purchase on 5/8/15. Big thanks to our sales-woman Celine Bian & the Lexus team! :))

Now that our family is expanding, it's time to get a newer, reliable, & bigger car. Celine walked over to us as we were looking at the show cars in the building and I told her, I gave them a call the other day asking about a vehicle on the lot. We just came to check it out because we're still on the search and didn't want to buy a car right away unless it was the right price and if it had everything we wanted. Hubby & I would not settle for less. She fully understands and showed us around (offered snacks, drinks, etc) and my husband asked if we were able to get one today, can she ""hook it up?"" Lol. She said, ""She will do the best she can"" & SHE SURE DID!!

So we went outside to the lot, took a few looks at some of the cars. She answered every single one of our questions without any trouble. Now that is a great sales person! She's very smart & knowledgeable. Just talking to her for the first 10 minutes, I knew she is the one who's gonna make us the happiest first time car buyers at the end of the day. She definitely gave us her honest opinions and I couldn't have agreed more. I like the fact she's easy-going, very talkative, not pushy at all. My husband and I finally came to an agreement on a car & Celine was ready to start our process.

We met Sales Manager - Ted Liu, both he and Celine worked a large amount of great deals for us until we all came to the middle. They definitely did a great job on giving us the best deals. No other dealership would have offered us that great deal and wouldn't have given us all their time & effort. Big bonus to those two! Ted is such a nice man, also very knowledgeable, & he also made my family (husband, 3 year old son, and I) very comfortable and satisfied with our new purchase. 

Now, half way through our process we met Financial Manager - Robert Riley; a funny fella I must say. He did all our paperwork and financial stuff quick & simple. He covered everything we had on the car & if we wanted extra warranty and other small packages, but we kindly declined since our new car was already fully loaded w/ warranty. He called Celine on the intercom that we are ready and I asked him, do you guys ever call her Celine Dion? He laughs and said a few of the guys out there do. My husband then noticed that Robert accidentally left the intercom on and he can hear us loud in the building. Oops! Lol.

We weren't able to take our car home that night so we came back early morning the next day. I believe, Mark Hudson - Financial Director went over our paperwork one last time to make sure everything was signed and congratulated us on our new purchase. (: He too, is a nice man.

Last final step, Celine went over our car & showed us how everything works. Everything seems pretty easy to remember and if we did need help, we can always read the manual book or give her a text. Time to take this baby out on this beautiful Saturday morning! :D

Overall, our car experience at Lexus of Stevens Creek was great! We were in & out, done with paper work within 3 hours. No pressure. No heat. You definitely can rely on the Lexus team to get you the car you want and get the best deals in town! We don't regret our purchase one bit and I'm so thankful Celine was the one who helped us out. She is the BOMB! I definitely recommend her if you need help with purchasing a new/used car.

Stephen was very patient, helpful, and knowledgeable. I also greatly appreciated that he wasn't pushy like other dealerships who didn't have my best interest in mind and who just wanted to make a sale without offering me exactly what I wanted. After my initial visit with Stephen, I visited three other dealerships to help me decide exactly what car would be best for me. Those visits easily pushed me back to Stephen because, even when they had the same car in stock, none of them treated me as kindly or with the same level of professional and excellent customer service.

358,"April 10, 2015","I am a return customer to Lexus of Stevens Creek.  I had purchased a 2010 Lexus 450H and loved the experience that I had with Herman.  He was very nice and knowledgeable about the car and wasn't too pushy on things.  He took the time to explain the various things in the car and was very patient with us during the test drive.  Needless to save we drove off with a brand new car that day.  A few years later Herman contacted us regarding if we were interested in selling the car back to Lexus since we had low mileage on the vehicle.  After much debate, we sold the car back for a decent price.  Again the process was quick and painless thanks to Herman.

This past week I found myself in need of another car to buy.  I had narrowed it down to an Audi A3 vs. a Lexus IS250.  The test drove the Audi A3 the day before and had my mind set on it, but decided to give Herman a call to see what offers were available from Lexus for a 3-year lease.  I sat down and talked with Herman about what I was interested in looking at and we discussed the various options from the available cars.  The process was quite simple since I didn't need a navigation package.  He input a few things into the computer and the selection of available cars went from 37 down to 2.  They were both F-sport models on the IS250.  I hadn't done too much research on them but we took a test drive and I was pretty happy with it.

We went back to crunch some numbers and came up with a deal that was good for me for a 3 year lease and I walked out with another new car from Lexus of Stevens Creek.  I highly recommend Herman to anyone interested in looking for a new car.  He's been there a long time and will definitely treat you well.

The first time I visited the dealership, he helped me with test driving a couple of the CT 200h hybrids, as I wasn't sure I was going to like the feel of a hybrid. He let me drive a new and past year model to let me see any differences. Since I wanted some time to think about it, he offered me his card and told me to contact him if I had further questions. I ended up coming back the next weekend, for which I emailed and asked when he was available. He then helped me in running numbers and looking at the difference between several options. Even though it was the typical several hours (as is the norm when buying a car), he seemed genuinely helpful and didn't try to upsell me anything. He even gave me an honest opinion on how much of a trade-in value I could get from my current car and some pointers on features that he discovered being a Lexus car owner. He was very respectful and I am glad to have bought my car from him. There was just one minor issue with them not being able to locate the car, as it had been delivered just that morning and it had been parked in the used car lot. Steven was very apologetic and went around the entire dealership probably for at least an hour looking for the car himself and I felt bad for him, so I just told him I could come back the next day to pick it up.

When we first entered Lexus of Stevens Creek we were helped by another gentlemen sales rep. However he opted to be multi-task and impolitely turned his back on us in speaking to another party without advising us to wait. Anyhow, we looked around and we were fortunate enough to be helped by Celine Bian. We told her we did not commit ourselves to any sales associate yet. She is very professional, like-able, courteous, knowledgeable, not pushy, listened to all our needs, focused on finding us the most ideal car, worked with us in helping us to purchase a potential car within our financial means and that she did! We test drove 2 cars and ended up buying a nice white pearl 2013 certified Lexus GS hybrid 450 the very same evening! We simply loved the car and our experience at Lexus Stevens Creek has been outstanding because of her.

368,"April 01, 2015","As a first-time car buyer, going here is the right choice.

I am a first-time car buyer who recently decide to buy a Lexus car as my birthday gift. Few months ago, when I entered this store, Peter Chu hosted me nicely by introducing me some pre-owned cars they have, and in my following visits, I have a comfortable test drive on ES350.  About two weeks ago, I am still undecided on which cars I want to buy, so I decide to come here again to see is there any car that matches my taste.  That was a hot afternoon with many customers, and my friend and I have no appointment but Numer Talag actually hosted us nicely such that we can try the Mark Levinson audio system on RC even he has some customers on his hand.

After that visit, I am pretty determined to buy a Lexus IS and then I decide to quote a price online.  Jennifer Martinez contacted me swiftly, and made a clear statement that they will try to earn my deal if there is any better quote I could found anywhere; this is impressive since there is no dealer telling that.  More importantly, her prices are the second best when I met her, and she follows her promise to  meet and even beat the best price I bought.  Those are clear signs of quality service, which eventually earns my trust of buying car from them.

After I decided to buy IS350, Jennifer guided me to finance Nor Assad, and after a long day of work, I was originally pretty tired, and Nor helps me finishing those troublesome paperwork in a short time.  During the service, you can sense the humor from Nor, and his passion on his work.  That is a wonderful experience without doubt.  And today, I finally got my car, and please allow me to show my greatest gratitude to their service here.  ",5.0

From the moment we arrived dealer, and had our first test drive, without being pressured into purchasing right there and then, we knew that we would be back. However, with Add's follow thru, and expertise, and patience, it just made it so much easier to finally make that decision to buy my new RX350. Addy, at all times was very accommodating with my requests, regarding the specifics of what I wanted my new vehicle to be. She even went as far as to finding my PERFECT car when they did not have it in stock. To top it off, Addy gave me a very competitive price that I could not refuse. She is not your ""typical"" sales person, she truly does care about your needs and wants when it comes in purchasing a vehicle of your choice.

382,"March 01, 2015"," I recently took delivery of a GX 460 through Jennifer.  She was a joy to work with throughout the entire process.  I came in with a very specific idea of the vehicle I wanted.  We quickly came to the conclusion that the best thing was to order one from the factory.  I was given an expected price and time frame after my first test drive.  I had some concerns about the vehicle fitting in my garage since it was wider than my vehicle at the time, so she suggested we have another test drive which included stopping by the house and parking it in the garage.  The GX arrived well within the expected time frame, and Jennifer kept me informed as it made its journey from the factory.  Jennifer had the answers to all my questions, and spent a good amount of time both pre and post delivery explaining the various features of the vehicle, including the very GX specific feature (4wd system, off road handling).  Dealing with the finance department was a breeze.  I definitely recommend Jennifer and Lexus of Stevens Creek.  This was by far the best car buying experience I’ve had.",5.0
383,"February 28, 2015","The reason why I keep going back to Lexus of Stevens Creek is for one reason and one reasin only: Mr. Joe Hart! I leased my first lexus 3 years ago from Joe after being referred by another professional auto sales that I had trusted for years from another brand. So it was very natural to get a referral from him to inquire about Lexus when I knew it was the next car I wanted to drive. Everything from setting up appointments to viewing thought vehicle inventories and all the way through the financing and vehicle deliveries, Joe made every step as transparent and easily understandable as it can be. Joe never makes us feel pressured into any decisions, but has always provided the most comprehensive recommendations based on our needs, wants, and budgets. One week ago I went back for my lease end arrangement and leased another vehicle from Joe. Because how good the car is and how wonderful the car buying experience he created, I refferred another friend of mine to Joe and they just leased the same car as I bought from Joe today! I have confidence that whomever I refer to Joe and Lexus of Stevens Creek, Joe and the entire team there will always duplicate the wonderful expereience I had as a new and returned customer. Wish everyone an easy and hassle free for your next vehicle transaction!

Lie after lie which would have been okay except we had just driven 3 hours to see this vehicle. We were looking at a used highlander and when we got inside it smelled so strong like a pet groomer and 20 wet dogs. Then to make matters worse, the car didn't start. Literally. After he tried smoothing things over, we drove the car and we just couldn't get the smell out of our head. Then Parrish told us, ""don't feel bad... We will sell this car if you don't want it."" To which I replied, ""We don't feel bad for you! You should feel bad for us! We just drove 3 hours to a wet dog smelling vehicle that didn't start!"" Needless to say I was pissed, then of course when we get back to the dealership this xxxxxxxx tries to hurry us along because supposedly someone else ""is ready to buy it"". I mean he even had another dealer come out and hand gesture in a hurry as if there was someone actually standing there with a was of cash ready to buy.

When my wife and I decided to purchase a new car it was a no brainer to look Joe up again and see what he could do for us. Joe spent approximately five hours with us; procuring the best trade in value for our two vehicles, test driving the new 2015 RX 450h with us, discussing all its features and advantages over similar models, and then sitting down with us to give us the best purchase price on the RX 450h we had selected. In addition, after our purchase Joe gave us a tutorial of the RX 450h and told us that if at any time we had any questions to just give him a call on his cell phone. He will even take your call on his day off, which is exceptional customer service, but then again, that’s just Joe.

487,"April 20, 2014","My experience in purchasing a new car with Lexus Stevens Creek was EXCEPTIONAL. At the time, I was a current owner of 2 Lexus cars, a 2006 GS 300 and a 2008 RX 400h. I had been looking to buy a car for 3 weeks and had  visited numerous Lexus dealerships, that I had previously done business with, close to my home in Daly City but none of the sales reps that I engaged with seemed interested in helping me find the right car. 

I purchased my GX 460 after engaging with Vincent Nguyen through the internet. I researched for cars on-line and inquired to Lexus Stevens Creek and Vincent was the one that responded to me. I drove 60 miles to test drive the GX 460 but did not purchase because I wanted to trade in my RX400h but unfortunately, did not get the price I was looking for. 

I went back to dealerships closer to my home the next week thinking that someone locally would truly want to help me find the right car but my experiences were less than inspiring and I was questioning why would I want to buy a car from them. Vincent continued to engage with me via e-mail inviting me to come back and after my 2nd inquiry about the GX 460, we negotiated a price that was acceptable to all and so I came in at 6pm Friday, April 18th to buy the car. 

Vincent was ending his day but before leaving, introduced me to Celine Bian and she finished the deal, creating all the necessary paperwork. She was so kind and gracious helping me through the paperwork, staying with me to answer any and all questions I may have had. Soon after finishing the paperwork, I was then introduced to Eddy Ghanim who was extremely helpful in securing the necessary financing for the vehicle through Lexus Financial. Eddy helped to secure a competitive rate, with better terms. The one thing that really stood out to me was that he acknowledged and thanked me for being a long time, loyal customer to Lexus. Obviously, he had done his homework and made me feel extremely valued to Lexus, going well beyond my expectations from the financial perspective. Instead of selling to me, he helped me get a better value for buying the car. I ended up buying the Premier Luxury Care add-on because the value he presented to me was rational and provided a benefit to me over the course of 5 years and never, once, was any pressure placed upon me to buy against my will. 

So, I am very pleased and excited to write this review as Lexus Stevens Creek went beyond my expectations, made me feel extremely valued as a long time and loyal Lexus customer, and the service rendered by Vincent, Celine and Eddy was exceptional and exemplary at all times, I was in the market to buy two new Lexus's, the GX 460 and the IS 250/350 and so the first half is accomplished and I now look forward to relinquishing the RX400h in lieu of getting the new IS 250/360. Lexus Stevens Creek will be the first place I look to in order to get this done. ",5.0

He asked us if there was any particular color that we would prefer.  We told him we would not want Black, Red or White.  After searching for what was available, he came up with several silver colored IS 250's.

After the test drive, we were told that he would work out the best price for us, since we had been Lexus customers for the past 10 plus years.

From the initial meeting to driving our new Lexus off the lot was seamless  all due to Robert’s knowledge & professionalism. Please pass the word on to Robert  how much we appreciated his effort and will recommend him to anybody who wants to buy a new car. Also because of Robert we will be coming back to Stevens Creek for any future automobile purchases. 

Thank you

The team at Stevens Creek have a different approach to selling cars, and it is refreshing, mainly because they take the time to do everything right by the customer. They were competitive with the price (thank you Domingo/Vincent), kept us informed of what they were doing while we there, and RYAN was AMAZING at educating my father on all of the features of the Lexus.

499,"March 25, 2014","I have been looking at purchasing a new car for the past year and finally thought it was time to at least start test driving one. Despite researching on numerous models of cars and brands over the past year, I have continued to go right back to the Lexus CT200 Hybrid. My daily commute is pretty bad, so my requirements were something reliable, fuel efficient, and comfortable... The day before I had considered test driving this car, I figured I could at least send an email to sales on the Lexus site to just give them a heads up. Ryan responded and gave me all the information that I needed prior to checking out the car (what they had in stock, what to expect from seeing the car, etc.), so I already felt prepared when walking into the dealership the next day. Saturday morning came and we were introduced to Ryan... My feelings going into purchasing a car were completely thrown out the door when we met Ryan. I thought I was going to feel rushed and pressured into purchasing a car, but Ryan was quite the opposite. His relaxed personality was very contagious, as the whole process seemed conversational. He listened to what we were looking for, he respected the space and time that we needed, and he answered every question that we had. He definitely had our best interest in mind. I came in Saturday morning looking to just test drive cars, but I ended up leaving Saturday afternoon with a brand new 2014 Lexus CT200 Hybrid. Not to mention, we weren't at the dealership that long. We arrived at 1030 Saturday morning and I was home before 4PM. Talk about a great experience! Very much recommended.

We were originally thinking about getting an RX450h and Herman was gracious enough to ask us *why* we wanted to purchase a hybrid vehicle. It's apparent that he had our best interest in mind, saving the most we could while purchasing a comfortable vehicle, so we were pleased to know that there was never any pressure to purchase the most expensive version of the RX series.

We've been customers of Lexus of Stevens Creek for more than a decade and they are indeed the best at customer satisfaction in the Bay Area. Most people have terrible experiences purchasing a car from a dealership, but when you're getting a Lexus (which is a typically higher price than a normal vehicle you see on the street), you're paying for customer satisfaction, convenience, and a seamless experience in the purchase as well as the years after when you bring it in for oil changes and check ups.

I highly recommend this dealership and brand over others you may be considering. Lexus does an extremely good job taking care of it's customers and the amount of cars and returning customers demonstrates their success. ",5.0

As we were starting to sign the paperwork, things took turn with every conceivable bait & switch price tactic; these guys lived up to every negative car salesman stereotype in the book.  I mention this experience because it anchors one end of a continuum re: how to do car business; our experience with Lexus of Stevens Creek--Ryan Schrantz specifically--anchors the opposite.  From the initial (email) contact through driving out of the dealership's door last night, the process was efficient, respectful and super-friendly.  We got a beautiful roadster at  what I perceived to be a fair price for both parties; Ryan made it easy and hassle free; and his customer-centric attitude was front and center.  Before leaving, he programmed the bluetooth music system so I had my iPhone tunes and set the nav system to guide me home.

After going to a few dealers and car lots, we made our way over to Lexus. We walked around looking at the cars and a few sales staff just walked by us. Then, After a while, Mr. Robert Riley came out and began walking our way. His positive attitude, friendliness and his confidence caught my attention. He greeted us with a friendly hello and a firm handshake. He began talking to us like we knew each other for years, it was a great feeling. We told Mr. Riley,  we saw a vehicle we liked and that possibly someone else might be buying it. But as the saying goes, it's up for grabs until someone signs on the dotted line. We went for a spin and Mr Riley was just professional and courteous in every possible way. The second he acknowledged us and greeted us with a firm hand shake and then the kindness and friendliness he displayed, I knew I came to the right place and dealt with the right man. We talked and at no time he seemed pushy or any other way you may hear stories of sales men. Mr Riley was awesome and he gave us the attention only fit for kings. He truly made us feel welcomed and made me want to spend my hard earned money, there with him. Even after we bought the vehicle, he took the time to go over every detail of the vehicle and walked us through it and made sure we knew the type of quality of gas it took. 91 Mr Riley said, and it will run like a dream.

Our experience with the finance manager Edward Hsieh was very positive as well. He explained the extended Penske warranty without any hype, and initially I didn't want it, but ended up purchasing it due to all the electronic options the vehicle had (and which would be very expensive to replace).

When we got to the dealership, Joe came out and greeted us, but we told him we were looking for the salesman we saw a few days earlier. Joe was happy to find the other salesman for us, but later found out that he was busy with another customer. Guess we lucked out!

Since the car was for my wife, she was very particular about the color of the car, and Joe was very patient with her, as she couldn't make up her mind. Finally she found ""the one"", and we took it out for a test drive. Everything seemed fine, and Joe took us to his office to hammer out the deal.

Having done my research on the price of the car already, I was ready to go into full negotiation mode. Joe told us the price that it would normally go for, but using his ""magic"", he could get it down even more. It basically left me at a point that I had no idea how to negotiate on price since it went way above (or is that below?) my expectations!  

After the sale was done, and after waiting an eternity in line to sign all the papers, Joe was again very patient with my wife, as he explained to her how to operate the different functions and features of the car.

We took our car to the service center and the service rep that helped us literally ""raved"" and highly enthusiastic about how the 2013 Hybrids were completely redone from a mechanical/engine point of view.  With little from what we were able to learn from the 15 minute education, my husband was totally blown away and said ""If I knew what I know now, I would get a 2nd RX450H!""  I would only think that learning those features during the sales process would sell more Hybrids. (but that just my .2 cents) :) ~S. Furlanic, Aptos, CA

She spent all the time we needed to discuss the vehicle and we scheduled to come back the next morning.  Jennifer was friendly, efficient and helpful through the whole process.  This was by far one of the best experiences in buying a car that I have had at a dealership.  This was our first Lexus purchase and the initial experience will make it tough to consider another manufacturer in the future.  After the sale, Jennifer promised to follow-up on an item that I had requested.  She made contact the following business day and handled the request.

552,"January 06, 2014","I've known Joe Hart for several years now and this is the 4th Lexus we have purchased from him. He is friendly, courteous and knowledgeable about the cars he sells. Also, I first do my shopping around and then approach Joe to get his best price and he usually matches or beats what I have been able to come up with. This is a no-pressure sales situation - and he is quite helpful in other areas as well. For example, this time I could not get a hold of my insurance agent as it was the weekend. Joe recommended an alternate approach that worked very well and was quite convenient.

564,"December 22, 2013","From beginning to end, Ms. Martinez's performance and handling of my business was simply outstanding.  

Very late on a Saturday afternoon I completed an on-line request for information for a certified, pre-owned Lexus ES300.  That same evening, Ms. Martinez sent her first email acknowledging my request and offering to help.  The morning, she followed up with a phone call and we quickly set  an appointment for that very afternoon.  

When I arrived at the dealership, she greeted me with a friendly smile and from that moment on, I enjoyed the best experience I've ever had purchasing a car.  She took me out to the lot to see the vehicle, she answered every technical and business question I had, she offered to go for a test drive, and when the time came to get the paperwork done, she made the process of application very easy.  In a highly efficient and very courteous manner, she commanded the attention from her colleagues in the credit and finance departments, as well as every one else who had to be involved in completing the purchase.  I arrived at 6:30 pm; a couple of hours later I was driving home with the car of my choice.

Ms. Martinez was committed to see me go home with my newly purchased car and that is when she made the greatest gesture of customer attention and service:  I had driven to the dealership with a rented car and she offered to accompany me to the car rental office to return the vehicle, so I could then enjoy my new purchase that same evening.  With her kindness and insistence on accompanying me to the car rental location she also helped me avoid the considerable inconvenience involved in having to do this by myself.  And keep in mind, this is all happening late on a Sunday evening, at around 8 pm; well past closing time at Lexus Steven Creek, and well beyond the call of duty!

My highest commendation cannot be overstated.  If I had to lead a team of professionals to get things done, I would want Ms. Martinez to be o my team.",5.0

Now, I've moved to the Santa Cruz Mountains and need a vehicle that better suites my commute and lifestyle. I contacted Joseph to let him know that I was interested in a used RX, and not only did we set up an appointment to do some test drives, but he also worked with me prior to our appointment - providing me with further information about cars I was interested in or informing me about vehicles I may not have come across on my ow.. When I arrived at the dealership for my appointment, he was expecting me, which I really appreciated. 

Like many others, I live on a strict budget, therefore I had very specific perimeters for which I wanted to stay within regarding what I would receive for my trade-in, interest rate and monthly payments. Personally, negotiating is painful no matter what, but Joseph made the experience less painful and really helped me to achieve what I wanted. I did go over my budget for my monthly payment by $50, but I was able to include a service maintenance plan and an extended warranty plan - something that will be a huge savings for me. Joseph was great to work with and as long as I can afford a Lexus I will bring my business to him.

He was very honest about the price (which was already a zero markup for them) and there was no hassle on negotiation. The price of the car had already dropped down since it was posted online as they had the 'one price' deal going on. He also helped me get a good price on my trade-in car which had a structural damage. Joe had the car ready exactly I wanted it and I took off :)

I drove a 2001 Honda Civic and after finishing all my education and training and being out in the real world I thought it was time to reward myself. I worked with closely with Anita, Herman, and Edward and they are an excellent team. Herman and Eddie helped us pick the right vehicle for our needs. We chose a 2013 CT200h. Herman showed us all the pros/cons of each different model and the features that made this vehicle special. Eddie was knowledgeable and honest and really took the time to understand our needs and made appropriate recs. Anita was great! She took the time to go over EVERY financing option in terms of lease, buy, etc. We went through every fathomable way to save $ and come out on top. She explained lease formulas clearly and was very kind. She even offered to watch my young children so I could test drive with my wife. Now, that is impeccable service. Anita knows her stuff and will work with you and your family to put you into the Lexus that is right for you.
I highly recommend this place

I told him to run the numbers and we can go from there while Ann took us for a test drive.

629,"April 25, 2013","To whom it may concern,

When i came in to view the car i saw online, it was scratched on the outside and had burn marks on the inside and (apparently) was listed with a certified pre-owned price. Herman made no concession on the price for the damage as it was already ""such a great deal"". I learned that the dealership would not review the car for what was needed to certify it (so i wouldn't know what the problems were if i bought it without being certified) unless i opted to pay the increase. The cost to have it certified was almost 7% of the total sale price! After deciding (with help) that i should pay the increased, non advertised cost, I found after the inspection that the car needed 4 new tires, wipers and a slew of other minor fixes! that $1,000+ cost is something you would have hit me with blindly after my next required check in to keep my certified warranty valid! What happened to the idea of selling a car for what its listed at? Just tell me the price up front, no gimmicks!  

I had to wait an unknown amount of time for the inspection and changing of tires. I was told a few days, but it took over two weeks and I had to do the mole work to find someone who could provide me a straight answer on an expectation of when i would get the car that i had already put 15K down for. I personally had to call the dealership to find the service number (different location), the service manager then had to get back to me once he figured out what car was mine and still could not set my expectation for when i would get my car. 

All in all i was unable to get an effective expectation on anything, be it the price, problems, turn around or delivery date of my purchase. 

None of this included the finance manager who insisted i was STUPID for asking what the FINAL price would be (has he tried to up sale quite a bit, presumably due to his commission structure) since ""that should have already been covered by the salesman before i met with him""! I felt like the JPmorgan customer being refereed to as a ""muppet""!  

Please don't infer from the negative connotation of this message that i am an overall negative person who's incapable of being pleased. Quite the contrary, i simply expect to be treated fairly, up front and made to feel as if i am a customer and not the middleman between a company and its $. needless to say i will not be looking for any other business from this dealership. Should i need service or another car i will be going to another Lexus dealership and recommend the same to any who ask.

Sincerely,

Nate Tockerman ",2.6

Hi Ryan-

I wanted to take some time out and thank you for your time and efforts yesterday afternoon. It was such a huge pleasure to meet you and work with you through this process. 

From our first encounter, to leaving off of the lot- I felt extremely supported and hopeful (and thats not easy with me, ask Kellan!)  I was expecting to be rushed, stressed and pressured. I am extremely indecisive and you made everything very clear and made me feel comfortable the whole time. I definitely did not feel the typical way you feel when you go into a car dealership. I was not expecting to walk out with a vehicle yesterday, hence not even having any cash or our potential trade in car on me at first. I knew I needed the vehicle but it did not seem in reach. You were knowledgeable kind, patient… and I think the other dealerships can learn a lot from you.

My experience with the other staff, from your sales manager, to the front desk employee to the finance manager- and employees just walking buy- was so amazing. Your team has created an atmosphere of pure luxury and ease.

I now feel proud and safe with my new 2013 (OMG!) Lexus RX 350!!!! My dream car I did not expect to attain anytime in the nearest future.

Please forward this message to your manager and your team members.

I am forever grateful- and forever a lexus client! : ) and it is my pleasure.

Thank you again- and will keep in touch!

Herman was very patient while I went back and forth between the CT and RX, he never rushed me and once the decision was made he made sure that the paperwork was pretty painless.

655,"March 18, 2013","When deciding on where to purchase our latest Lexus from I thought of our local Lexus dealership here in the Monterey Bay Area where my wife's family had previously purchased two other vehicles from. No other dealership even crossed my mind, until I realized that they weren't interested in truly helping my find my CT200h nor making my buying experience easy. All I walked away with from the local dealership was that finding my CT200h in the color and interior combination I wanted was going to be a struggle, or at least that was what I was told. 

Thats when I decided to contact at Lexus of Stevens Creek, and after browsing their website and submitting a contact request I was  immediately called by Herman who was actively looking into finding my CT200h in the exterior color and interior combination my wife and I were looking for. Later that afternoon Herman called me with some great news and had located a CT200h that was on a ship that was due to hit the docks in a couple weeks. Being the anxious person that I am, I asked Herman what I needed to do to get my name on that CT200h. Herman mentioned all that was needed was a small deposit and over the phone and that the car would be mine! I was astonished that in less than a day Herman found my car which I was previously told was going to be to hard to find and just didn't exist. During the couple weeks while the car was enroute to the dealership, I contacted Herman many times by phone and email, each time he quickly responded and always had an update for me as to where my car was in its travels to the dealership. Herman was so good with his communication that I was able to pick up the car immediately after it had been unloaded of the truck. Ted in financing was great and was able to speed us out even with a trade in! 

The service advisors are awesome here, both Rick and Darren have helped me with the servicing of my car and I wouldn't dare take my car anywhere else. They have always been great and thats why I drive over an hour just to get my car serviced at Lexus of Stevens Creek. 

Looking back at my experiences at Lexus of Stevens Creek... Id say its been amazing and that there is no other dealership that I would purchase my next car from. 

Thank you Herman, Ted, Rick and Darren for making my Lexus experience a pleasurable one.

663,"March 01, 2013","I recently purchased a RX 450H.  Vincent Nguyen assisted me in the purchase. He did a professional job in helping me review my vehicle options that included test riding different styles and previewing different options.  From that point, he was gracious and configured many different options for my review.  In the end, we were able to negotiate a package that worked for me.  I felt respected throughout the entire process and would highly recommend purchasing from Vincent.  Only downside is that we missed lunch (inside joke).  ",5.0
664,"March 01, 2013","I rated this car dealership for the excellent service we were given when leasing a new car. Both Dottie Barbera and John Manasseh worked with us on leasing a 2012 Lexus CT200h. They are seasoned professionals who are very knowledgable and needless to say they gave us excellent customer service. Rich Sorrentino and Mark Hudson helped us afford the lease and finalize all the paperwork making it a breeze! This dealership gets a AAA rating from us. In fact we had such a great experience, we went back the next day and leased ANOTHER car from John Manasseh, a 2013 i250. Again Rich helped make our lease affordable and Eddie Ghanim made doing the paperwork effortless.

666,"February 26, 2013","My husband and I were going up and down Stevens Creek Blvd last week, and looked at various car lots. A few places did not even greet us or ask if we had any questions. We were interested in a particular vehicle and got NO service. So we decided to check out what Lexus had to offer. Right when we walked in the door we were greeted by a sales associate that was helping another customer. He let us know that someone would be with us right away. As we looked at the IS250 in the showroom, Dottie approached us with a friendly smile and asked if we needed help. We asked plenty of questions and she was very happy to help us. 
We ended up test driving the IS250, came back 2 days later and got a GREAT deal on a 2 year lease for the showroom car. Dottie was very patient with us as it took two days to go over whether or not this would be a good purchase for us. She followed up the day we were supposed to come back and made us feel welcome to come back.  It was a great experience! Dottie tabbed all the important pages in the Owner's manual for us, and walked us through all the features the car had to offer. She made sure to pair our phones to the bluetooth, and made the whole process very painless.
Once we were approved for the lease, Ted assisted us on the finacial side. He walked us through the terms and agreements and made sure we were making the right decisions best suited for our needs. Lexus of Stevens Creek is one of the best car dealerships we've been to!

These were critical times for me, needing a vehicle for several paramount consulting contracts in process, and real estate transactions for several families in process.

Too expensive I thought.  Little did I know.  I contacted Stevens Creek Lexus and there I met Herman Samaniego.  I explained my situation and told him what I wanted to pay ""tops"".  ""What if I can beat that,"" he offered.  He did.  But still I was suspicious.  In his business, who can you trust.  Little did I know.  Despite my visits to other dealerships, Herman stayed with me. . . .online.  His messages were simple.  He was patient and at no time tried to pressure me into buying a Lesus from his dealership.  When you're ready, come on in, Jim, and lets take a test drive.  And when I did, I was amazed at how friendly he and the people around him were.  When I still had more questions, he arranged for me to meet those individuals who could answer my questions.  Herman, I said, you're making this hard.  I have a friend who is the sales manager at another dealership who is making this hard for me.  Yet, even he couldn't beat Herman's price.  I was sold.  Price. Quality. Service.  Nothing beats it.

I was so incredibly, wonderfully wrong. Dottie is a class act in every sense of the word. She was both friendly and no-nonsense and made me and my mother feel completely welcome.

Our offer was accepted (though the asking price was great to begin with) and in less than fifteen minutes, I had the keys to shiny new-to-me car.

716,"December 29, 2012","I was here already 4 times, and tomorrow I am going there for the LAST TIME I WISH!!! The reason why it is the last time is these:

I was there for the first time at the 16th December, 2012. We chose one 2013 Lexus GS 350 with F Sport package. We agreed with the car and it's price at the same day. After agreeing in everything I asked them to give me their bank information, but they told me to get Cashier's Check in order not to wait until they receive the wire transfer.

The next day, December 17, 2012 morning we(me and my father in law) got the cashier's check and went to the dealership to get our car. We signed everything, did everything, saw our car again. And we told that we will pick up the car the next day.

I came with my friend to the store to pick up MY CAR, but they started to ignore me. Everybody in the office started saying that they told me ""Cashier's Check needs to be cleared after 10 WORKING DAYS!!! AND YOU CAN GET YOUR CAR AFTER THAT!!!"" which was a LIE!!!
I returned back home in SHOCK!

Next day I went to the bank, and got the statement. Took that statement with me to their office. The statement was saying ""MONEY WAS WITHDRAWN FROM THE CASHIER'S CHECK AT THE 18TH OF DECEMBER, 2012"" which was the next day when I gave them my Cashier's Check.

Yesterday, the 27th of January I told them that I will call my Lawyer and bring him with me. Even though, they told me ""You can take your lawyer and come to our office"", they even don't care about their clients.

I am calling everyday 3-4 times. Most of the times they even don't answer the phone. The salesman ignores me. The operator lady named Maya is also saying the same thing which Salesman says to me.(not only salesman, also a finance manager and the guy called Brian, who helped us to sign all the documents)

I told them at least to return my money back. They don't return my money or car back.

And now they tell me that they will give me my car at the 2nd of January. It will be 2013 and the car will be 2012 year produced. IT WILL  HAVE DISCOUNT ON IT.

I need some help to solve this problem! If any suggestions please send me an e-mail to this address: hajyatayev@gmail.com

717,"December 27, 2012","I had a good idea of the car I wanted and located several good options on several dealer websites, and used the online form to get more information about proceeding forward.

Lisa promptly wrote me back and invited me in to drive the cars in question.  She was wonderfully responsive (in a very busy time of the year!) and was able to quickly schedule my drive and deliver a quote that helped my family to make our decision.  (For the record, neither of the other dealers replied at all except for a canned email reply that didn't answer my questions at all.)

There was absolutely no pressure and so much support for the process.  She and her manager did a great job on getting us a good price on the cars we were considering, and everything was so straightforward -- never a moment of stress or pressure.

I did the final test drive on a busy Saturday, and didn't really expect that I'd be able to wrap up the final transaction that afternoon, but once I made my decision, I was fully paperworked and out the door with my new (detailed, floor matted, etc) car in a very prompt fashion!  (Cheers to Andrew who was easily able to do all the official forms after a date needed to be changed.)

Thank you SO MUCH for making this a wonderful year end.  We cannot recommend Lisa highly enough.

718,"December 26, 2012","Started out looking for a used ES 350 in the 20-25K range.  I did my homework looking for cars in that price range at other lexus dealers, craigslist, and carfax.  Found a couple of cars but they were selling fast.  Eventually found an LS with higher than preferred mileage but just under 20.  When I arrived at the dealer, this was going to be the first car I wanted to see since it was a new arrival with no pictures posted.  The staff was ready for my arrival with a nice posting of my name and no waiting.    I met Mr. Samaniego and he told me based on an earlier email, he had already picked out a car for me to drive.  I told him I wanted to see the LS first and showed him the web listing.  Guess what.  That the the same car he wanted to show me.  This is a very good dealership  and service shop in terms of customer service.  You may pay a little premium for the excellent service, but it saves me tons of time. 

One of my friends wanted me to consider some other brands but I have had too much success with the Lexus brand to consider switching.  I plan to keep this car for a long time.

767,"November 28, 2012","Just bought a new CT200h from Stevens Creek Lexus. 
   
Buying a car is a lot easier these days due to  the internet, but there still exists the need to interact with a salesperson and of the inquiries I made with many Bay Area dealers, I’m glad we happened upon Ryan Schrantz at the very beginning of our car search for my wife.    What a nice guy!  SCL was the closest Lexus dealer to our home and he took us for our initial test drive of the CT.   He was extremely patient on the test drive, didn’t rush us, is extremely tech savvy and took his time in explaining the various aspects of the car and there was no pressure to make a deal afterwards.   We left the dealership that day with a positive impression of Ryan and SCL.  He followed up the next day with a nice personal thank you via email for letting him show us the CT.   Little did we know that he would become the barometer for the other salespeople we met, as none of them measured up to that initial experience with Ryan……

I did keep in touch with Ryan throughout our car search and even though we didn’t buy a car for three months, once we decided on the CT200, he left enough of an impression that I took my best deal to him when we were ready and asked him if SCL could match it.  He was able to get us the price we wanted and we agreed to meet the day after Thanksgiving.   We had narrowed the buying decision down to two different color combinations and when we got there he was thoughtful enough to have both cars side by side ready for us.  Once my wife decided on the color, every aspect of the process of actually buying the car, from the paperwork to delivery, was done in a professional and courteous manner. 
  
I had a few questions after we got the CT home and he has always answered them promptly via email.   Refreshing to see  that it isn’t all just about the sale, but rather that the buyer is taken care of afterwards as well.

My wife dreads the entire car buying experience.  But with her new CT, she has nothing but nice things to say about Ryan and her experience at SCL.   Guess we are now Lexus customers for life.   That smile when she drove off with her sporty new car was priceless.  

Thanks Ryan for making this happen!!

770,"July 31, 2008","I saw an ad for a CPO 2006 Lexus GX 470.  I called the dealership and spoke to the salesman.I told the salesman that I had seen damaged cars on their lot before, but he said that was under the old management.  I told him that the dealership was far, but I would make the trip over there if he could assure me , that the car was not involved in any type of collision.  I told him that I was searching for a new SUV and that I had been to several Lexus dealerships over the past few months.  I also told him if the car was clean I would purchase it. I was told that the car was clean and that their philosophy is that the manager would never sell a car, that he would not sell to his own mother.

I rearranged my schedule and drove an hour and a half to the dealership in the heat. I also had to bring my 2 year old son along.  When i arrived at the dealership, the car was parked in the outside lot. It had not been washed and was quite filthy. The color was black, which makes it harder to see the repairs. After examining the car, I noticed that the front bumber was not aligned. I also noticed that the paint on the door did not match and was not smooth. The salesman said the stickers were still on the door jamb, but they can easily paint around them. I left the dealership annoyed that I had wasted my afternoon.  

I do not recommend purchasing a CPO vehicle from them.  I do not know about new vehicles, but I was left feeling that I could not trust them.

I think I will stick to BMW.",1.0
771,"August 22, 2005","Bought my SC430 used from another dealership, but these guys really treated me well when taking the car in for service.

Their service certainly isn't cheap, but it's worth it. =)

The dealership is brand new and looks fantastic. The salespeople were very knowledgeable about the GS430 when I took my friend in to look at one. Their service facility is the best I've EVER seen anywhere.

I sold the SC430 and went with a Mercedes Benz SLK55 for performance reasons, and boy will I miss the customer service from Lexus!!",3.4
