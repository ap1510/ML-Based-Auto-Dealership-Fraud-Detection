0,"November 12, 2019","Star Mazda worked with me to help fix an issue that happened during a service visit, and went 50/50 with me on a new part. The service manager and his team went out of their way to make sure me and my car were in great hands, and helped me get a new windshield quickly, efficiently, and cost effectively. ",5.0
1,"September 15, 2019",The staff is very accomodating & their service is fast.  I can just leave my car & have it fix. He provided me a ride i n going to my work & picking me up when my car is ready. I was able to get a good price for the repair because of the warranty. ,5.0
2,"August 31, 2019","From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with an amazing feeling. I had shopped around a bit, wasn't quite sure what I wanted, but I knew I wanted a lease. I wasn't expecting to leave with a car that day, but 2 hours later I was leaving with an amazing 2019 Mazda 3 with a great deal. Huge thanks to Ryan Sheikh for his amazing help with financing. My favorite leasing experience yet... I couldn't be happier!",5.0
3,"August 13, 2019",Went in to buy on a Saturday but needed the weekend to think about it. Didn’t feel pressured to purchase and was given the time to think about it. Went back on Monday and drove off the lot with my new CX-5 2019. Love my car so far! ,5.0

7,"August 11, 2019",I’ve been looking for a new car for months and Star Mazda made the process incredibly painless. Everyone I encountered had a smile on their face and said hello. MATTEO was my sales guy and was incredibly knowledgeable and attentive. He made the process incredibly simple and enjoyable. Don in finance was also great and explained all of the paperwork in very easy to understands terms. Will definitely recommend Star Mazda to others!,5.0
8,"August 11, 2019","Im practically in and out with my 30k maintenance service at star mazda. Roger is my man, he is spot on with time my maintenance will be done and hooked me up with free rides going back to work and picking up my car after the service. Overall, the staffs and crews are very accommodating. This is my go to place every time my CX5 check engine lights up. Always recommending them to friends and family for their mazda vehicles.",4.6
9,"August 11, 2019",Roy Wells always treats me like family and hooks my CX-5 up with great service! I’m happy to say that I’m a loyal Star Mazda customer.,5.0
10,"August 11, 2019","I always bring my mazda to this dealer for my routine oil changes and maintenance and Nathon usually assists me. The service tech noticed that my infotainment screen was acting up “ghosting” and Nathon I formed me that it could be replaced free of charge even after my car warranty was expired. Other mazda dealers charged me for diagnostic fees when I told them my display and backup camera didn’t work half of the time. 

Prices for services are standard and to be expected for a dealer but sometimes if you ask they’ll let you know if they have any service specials. 

The main reason for this review is to give a shout out to Nathon for always providing stellar service. ",4.6
11,"August 11, 2019",Gave them 5 star because they are very accommodating and they understood what my car needs without the hassle of explaining to them what was wrong with it. Thank you!,4.6

The inside of my car was dirty from the technicians, please consider wiping down the cabin once work is completed or wear gloves since my interior is light sand/ light light light greyish not quite white, I would appreciate since I make a huge effort to keep the interior and exterior as clean & conditioned as possible.  I did not mention to Roger because I did not know prior to entering my vehicle when leaving.

Great job Otherwise.,,,Thank You",5.0

20,"August 09, 2019",I had a flat tire on my Mazda6 when I was just passing through LA. After a few phone calls at several dealerships I decided to have my tires checked at Star Mazda. Deciding factor was the efficiency I experienced in securing a schedule. Craig and Ana were very helpful and explained everything and offered options as to what tires I needed. The atmosphere inside the waiting area was very pleasant with lots of reading materials and fruits. It was my first time to see a dealership offering this kind of amenities. I will not hesitate to have my car serviced again at this dealership.,5.0

They speak highly of their bosses and the owners and are clearly proud of where they work. They considered my needs as a customer on every level and I could not be happier with my whole experience. In particular Kyle worked to get me into the car I wanted and needed. He was kind, thoughtful and accommodating and funny. On top of that I completed everything in under 2 hours. Amazing. Will be a forever customer.",5.0

27,"August 07, 2019","I tried to start my car on Saturday morning and the battery was dead. I had to drive both of my girls up to Montrose for classes that they have on Saturday so I decided to jump start the car. After I got it jumped started, I took my girls to their classes. I then drove down to Star Mazda in Glendale. It was a pretty busy day, but they were able to squeeze me in. Jerry took great care of me. He said he only needed the car for a couple of hours, and arranged for a Lyft to take me back up to Montrose.  I came back about 2 to 3 hours later, and he had my car ready to go. They installed a brand new battery, and told me that it was still covered under warranty.  Jerry definitely went above and beyond my expectations.",5.0

31,"August 05, 2019","Our experience at star Mazda was very good, our salesman Brian was extremely helpful and just an overall nice person. I enjoyed my buying experience here and would highly recommend requesting Brian as your salesman if you are interested in purchasing a Mazda from this location. ",5.0
32,"August 04, 2019","What started off as a bad time at the dealership when they charged me for installing the rear view mirror when nothing was done to the rearview mirror, none of the USB outlets worked after installing the wireless charger and they would not let me borrow a loaner for the weekend as I had a camping trip. I felt pushed aside and drove a vehicle at night without a working rear view mirror. I scheduled a follow up appointment with the manager and the second time around it felt like they took me a lot more serious. They fixed the mirror, usb outlets, took care of three recalls in one day and let me use a loaner. A personal thank you to Roy the manager for the best service anywhere and for that I will be bringing in my other Mazda. ",5.0
33,"August 04, 2019",Kyle Groom was very responsive and helpful in getting us the Mazda3 hatch we wanted. He was quick to respond and very competitively priced. He took the time to walk us through the features and accommodated special requests with ease. ,5.0
34,"August 04, 2019","Will come back to this dealer/service department again. Henaro was awesome. Craig was awesome. Roy was awesome. Phone communication was excellent, keeping me up to date; they have a text service I've never seen before in any dealer and I've been through many. Had my keys duplicated/programmed/and cut. They uber you within 10 miles. Friendly high customer service staff. The only issue is that their car wash was down so my car wasnt washed at the time but it will get fixed so not a big problem. Maybe have a car wash stub/ticket to another car wash place if their car wash is down. ",4.6
35,"August 04, 2019",First service for my new Mazda 3. Friendly professional service with comfortable waiting area in Showroom with free Starbucks coffee and fruit. Jerry Chinchilla found me when service was completed so I didn't have to wait a minute longer. Nice!,4.8

Everyone is nice and patient with you even if you're frustrated at the car issues you're having. Roger Dominguez is great. ",5.0
39,"August 02, 2019","I go here regularly for oil changes and on-going maintenance. I had some problems with my breaks and got new pads and rotors. Also got new tires since the old ones had more than 54k on them and started to make a funny noise. My Mazda 6 feels like new again, and drives like new. I love this car and I am fortunate to have Star Mazda close to where I live. Roy Wells is the manager, he is very professional and truly looking forward to help and send you home a happy customer.

43,"August 01, 2019","Buying my new car was the best experience I’ve had at a dealership. John was great to work with, never a hard sell, always easy to reach. Working with the finance department was a joy, which rarely happens. If you want a mazda this is the place to go.",5.0
44,"August 01, 2019","Kyle was super helpful and I’m very pleased with the deal I got. 

I did not feel any pressure what so ever in my decisions making and was very pleased with the outcome. 

Definitely would recommend Kyle and Star Mazda. ",5.0
45,"August 01, 2019","I was told the service would take 2 hours, maybe 2.5 hours. Going back to work and then coming back would have been just over an hour so I decided to wait. The service took over 3. I wasn’t given any updates, even after I texted the phone systems that alerts you when you first arrive. The person in charge of my service never spoke to me, only said that he had to grab something that was printing, and we didn’t most of the transaction in silence. I was never shown what was fixed (I went in for a recall and an oil change) and honestly it would have been easier to go to Jiffy Lube for the oil change. 

I was really jealous of other customers because the gentle man. In a Mazda hat was so kind, and inviting. He showed people where the coffee was, gave updates, and spoke to people about the service that was going to be done. 

Not all employees are bad, and maybe I just was dealing with someone on a bad day, yet he didn’t make my day any better either. ",2.8

51,"July 30, 2019","After a few text messages and one phone call, I was ready to step into the dealership the following day to seal the deal.  The car of choice was ready for my approval and after a few questions, we just needed to wait for the finance person to be available.  (Unfortunately, it was a pre-holiday weekend, but given that, not long at all.)  The paperwork took as long as it took the printer to print.  ",5.0

58,"July 27, 2019",We shopped at multiple dealers for different brand autos and Star Mazda was the best dealership over all... Combination of safety features style and performance in a basic vehicle was outstanding for the Mazda 6 2018,5.0

61,"July 26, 2019",First time taking my CX9 to get serviced and Craig took care of my car in an hour. Thank you. Very satisfied with everything from start to end. ,5.0
62,"July 25, 2019","I’ve taken my car in for service a few times here and never had an issue before this occasion. The service employee told me my car was due for a specific maintenance, but a quick google search said it was generally not needed for another 10k on my car or if it had been 3 years. I questioned him about it and he said “you bought your car in 2017 and it’s practically 2020.” I bought my car in October of 2017 and it was beginning of July 2019 when he said this. That’s some significant rounding-up, considering it hasn’t even been two years. I declined to have the extra service done at that time and will likely take it to my old repair shop when it is time because I trust them more.

Secondly, when my car was ready I was called saying “it was going into the car wash as we speak.” I arrived 30 minutes later to pick it up and waited 15 minutes for my car, only to learn it had not even begun to be washed. I was told I could wait 25 more minutes but by that point I had to get back to work. I understand if they are busy, but just say so. It is insulting to be lied to. 

Overall I would take my car here for regular service, but not for any additional maintenance. It was an unfortunate experience after having no issues with prior visits here. 

Last note: There was a service employee whose name I didn’t catch. He drove the shuttle when I dropped off my car and helped me when I was waiting to pick up my unwashed car. He didn’t speak much but was exceedingly polite and professional, and I hope Star Mazda recognizes his value to their team. They could use more employees like him. ",4.0
63,"July 24, 2019","I was really impressed with the politeness and friendliness of the staff, as well as the  quality of service. Everything was explained in detail before they proceeded with repairs or servicing, and I felt their work was honest and reliable. Would highly recommend and will definitely return.",5.0
64,"July 24, 2019","Twelve-year old Miata retractable hardtop air conditioner drains required repair. Major labor (no parts), easy to cut oneself in process. No problems since car picked up. I’m happy at this point.  ",5.0
65,"July 24, 2019","Craig took such great care of my car and worked within my budget. His honesty on the timeline of what needed to be replaced immediately and what could wait took the financial pressure off of me in needing to replace everything all at once. As a single woman on a budget I never once felt like he was trying to up-sell me on products. Highly recommend this service, especially to other women who have had trust issues with their mechanics in the past—Star Mazda is respectful and will treat you fairly. ",5.0
66,"July 23, 2019",Kyle was great and very helpful. He helped me from start to finish. Great in explanation of the vehicle. I was in talk with 2 other dealers but Kyle won my business because how upfront and honest he was.,5.0
67,"July 23, 2019","Had an unbelievable experience with Star Mazda. Nothing but gentlemen. From the quick and free shuttle rides they offered to the cleanest sparkling car wash I have ever seen. They showed me that they truly care and left me driving off the lot feeling like I got a brand new car! Nathon is the man and took care of everything with prompt tenacity. Maybe it’s just me, but I could definitely feel a difference after this service visit. Thanks again, fellas. ",5.0

76,"July 19, 2019","After more than a decade of coming to Mazda for servicing, you can definitely tell that things have changed. I shouldn’t speak for everyone, as there are some amazing employees still that I interact with - Roy in particular is the best and am glad to see him still there as manager - but Roger in this case had zero interest in making sure the customer was satisfied. It felt more like the DMV - just get this person in and out + price gouge as much as you can without the customer catching on.

I understand it’s hard to acquire and keep good talent, but something needs to change. I’ll be back but to see Roy.",1.2

I appreciated the manager Roy coordinating the check in process and passing out bottled water for the hot day. The service department could use a few more staff checking in cars though to speed things up, saw empty desks on the left side. I heard David Gomez left the company, he was a big loss.

I decided to give Star Mazda a second chance and I’m glad I did because Roy ended up giving an discount and excellent car service.

I was given a ride back home which was nice, and I was told that I'd be notified when my ride was on the way after I got the call that my car was done.  My service was finished at around 1215, but I didn't get a call or text after that.  I had to call to remind the service center that I needed a ride back after giving them a couple hours.  Good overall service for the vehicle, but I don't like being forgotten about.",3.4

97,"July 06, 2019","Normally I enjoy coming to Star Mazda due to the excellent customer service. My last visit changed that. 

I worked primarily with Jerry Chinchilla, who was unresponsive via text and phone. I came in for a safety recall service appointment. During the 3 hour wait (longer than the provided estimate), I received no updates on my vehicle. When picking up my car, I talked to Roy Wells, who was friendly and pointed out that the car wash seemed to have ""missed"" one side of my car (there were in fact new streaks on my car, which I assume happened during the servicing). I did not have time to stay an additional 30 minutes for a new car wash, and so I left with a car that was dirtier than when I came in. 

After leaving, I noticed that the full-circle inspection had found a wheel misalignment (not mentioned at all when I picked up my car). I tried to contact my original advisor, Jerry, who told me he would call back after checking with the tech. That didn't happen.

Overall, just a very frustrating and sub-par experience from a dealership I normally enjoy visiting.",2.8

Can you imagine how alarming and upsetting such news would be?  Had he investigated further, BEFORE blaming the customer and BEFORE alarming the customer, he would have learned that the #4 intake rocker arm came off and that this was a known issue for Mazda with this model, having nothing to do with my oil changes.

The interior of the car was delivered dirty.  Sent it back to service to have it re-vacuumed and it was still delivered with dirty interior windows (had to stop on the way home and have the front window cleaned), the interior was dusty.

162,"June 04, 2019","So I will start off by saying that the staff here is very friendly, they always are. I have been going to this Mazda Service Center since 2015 and it was always good until this last visit.

I went in for an oil change and had a a tire rotation done as well. I got a call from the technician saying that I needed to change my breaks. He said that my back breaks were completely gone, down to the metal and that my front breaks were already past the point of being okay. I thought this was really weird because I had not noticed the slightest change in my breaks, not one of the typical warning signs of having low/bad brakes have been noticed and if I was down to the metal then I should hear some form of squeaking/grinding right? Or am I wrong here?  He told me it would be $299 to change out just the back breaks. I told him I could not do this at the moment but to please make a note of it for me. He calls me back and tells me that the manager wanted him to double check with me to make sure that I did not want to change my breaks because it was critical that I do it and that they would charge me just $199 for doing the back breaks but that $100 discount was only available to me at that very moment and would not be available if I went back another day. I still said no being that I felt my breaks were fine. A few days later I took my car to someone else to check it out. I told them I needed new breaks. After they took my car and began working on it they came back to me and asked why I thought I needed new breaks. I told them what happened at Mazda and they said that my breaks still had quite the miles left in them and that it was not crucial for them to be changed right away for in the near future. 

Once my service package that bought when I bought the car runs out I will not return to this location again and will go ask for a second opinion on everything that I am told I need when I go in for my services. Absolutely ridiculous that this would happen.",1.0

Mr. Madison did a terrific job welcoming me and taking my order.  There were problems with my Lyft however, which while is not in their control, didn't help the mood, and again when I returned to pick up the car, I was handed the wrong keys at first, which I flagged for them, then was told to go get my car out front.  After walking around and clicking the lock button to honk the horn, my car was nowhere to be found, because they hadn't pulled it out yet.

Where I'm unhappy is with the resolve!

I have brought my 2019 CX5 in three times now wanting help with my Nav System.  It only loads an extremely small portion of my contacts and the Text Message feature doesn't work at all.  All three times I have left the dealership with no resolve.

This last time, my check engine light came on and they fixed that.  BUT, yet again, I mentioned my text message feature not working and my contacts not fully loading.

For the third time they told me everything was working fine for them and a tech would show me how to make sure it works.  Well, I picked up my car, the tech came out to show me, and again no resolve.  The tech was clueless and told me to update my iPhone software to the latest update.  I told him i have done this the last two times and nothing was corrected.

At this point, I would like them to install the iPhone Car Play FOR FREE and we can call it even.

It has been almost a year with my brand new vehicles features not working how they should, I have brought the car in multiple times and no resolve.  The $250 installation would have paid for itself already in lost time (on both ends) and lost labor trying to fix this issue.

279,"April 04, 2019","We bought a Certified Mazda CX-5 from Star Mazda. Having done research on the vehicle ahead of time, having test driven the various CX-5 models, and with an appreciation of the assurances we would have buying a Certified model, we knew we could move quickly once we found one we were interested in.  The only variable we were left with was how difficult the transaction would be at the dealership, as almost all our car transactions have been long, painful, stressful processes.  We found the perfect model online and began a text chat with the dealership, and arranged to come test drive it that evening.  Our intention was to quickly drive it, give it a good solid visual inspection, and quickly negotiate a reasonable price within our budget. We arrived with very little time due to a sporting event we needed to attend and told the dealership we had 15-20 minutes only to get from test drive to completion.  First off, they took us seriously and worked hard to earn our business in that short time period.  In the end we drove the vehicle, reviewed its history, negotiated a fair price, and maneuvered through the paperwork and completed the sale in roughly 20 minutes.  We were thoroughly impressed.  We wish all car transactions could go this smoothly and quickly.  ",5.0

I did spend 3 hours at the dealership, a longer time than I would like. Maybe it is because I went on a Sunday afternoon and the salesperson was dealing with several customers at the same time. The best part of the whole process was the final wrap-up session with the finance representative Ryan Sheikh. He explained clearly all the financial terms on all the paperwork that I have to sign. No hard sell on additional products like other dealership, just very friendly conversational exchange, alleviating my displeasure on the 3-hr time spent in the dealership. Ryan should be a model employee in any service-oriented organization.",4.8

Decided what we wanted, picked out a vehicle from the USAA car buying program, of which Star Mazda is a participant in. I made arrangements with Brian Kim, the internet sales manager, for a next evening appointment. He brought the car down from storage and had it ready on the lot for us when we arrived, still having the transport wrappers on it. From there, everything was super smooth sailing. We had pre approved financing, but I wanted to check if we qualified for the incentive financing.  Took a little longer than expected, but at the end of a long week, I think my wife and I were just tired and ready to have the whole accident ordeal behind us. Don in finance was very pleasant and detailed our options thoroughly. Brian finished up our evening with the vehicle walkthrough, and that was that!

Craig even arranged for me to be taken back to work and picked up from work when my car was finished. This made the whole experience even better since I was able to leave my car and go about my day.

412,"February 05, 2019","I had to wait at numerous points throughout the purchase of the new car for up to 30 minutes at a time. I understand that it takes time to negotiate and run prices by the manager—that part did not bother me. But it took about 5 hours of being st the dealership (this was after the test drive and my intent was to buy the car). I had to wait approximately 45 minutes to speak with the finance person, who was extremely nice, but it was 4 hours into my experience at Star Mazda and I just wanted to get the car and go. 

Additionally, when I went to pick up the car in the afternoon a few days later, the car was in a lot that was about 10 minutes away. I had to wait again to go with the salesman to the lot, find the car, drive back to Star Mazda and stop to get gas on the way. Then the Apple car play that was installed in the car was not working when we tested it out. I was told to wait 20-30 min for the service center to fix it. 1 hour and 15 minutes later, it was ready for me to test out. Fortunately at this point it worked and I was able to drive home but the ordeal took 3 hours from start to finish. 

The people that worked there and helped me get the car we’re all extremely nice and friendly. I did not feel pressured to get the car. I have no complaints about the interactions. But especially on the day I went to pick up the car, I expected it to be in the lot and have gas, and also the whole reason why I waited a few days  to take it home was to have the Apple car play installed but this wasn’t even the case.

I live by the Culver City Mazda (I live about an hour away from Star Mazda) so I went there for service, and was told that my plan only worked at Star Mazda?! Culver City Mazda said that I could purchase the use anywhere location plan for literally the same price as this ""Star Mazda only"" plan, and that I could just call to cancel my Star Mazda plan and I would get a full refund since I had not used it yet. Call Star Mazda to find out that I will NOT get all of my money back (apparently, it's prorated) and I had to come in (over an hour drive) to sign a piece of paper saying I want to cancel.

424,"January 23, 2019","After much shopping around at other dealers, as soon as I walked into Star Mazda, saw the exact vehicle I wanted and met Sophia, an outstanding saleswoman, I knew I'd be in good hands. 24 hours later I was able to drive off the lot in a gorgeous new Mazda 6, at a deal with which I was comfortable, and, this may sound strange, connected with a group of fine people I would consider a warm part of my Mazda family (Mazdas have been in my family for over 25 years). 

Sophia was personable, honest, friendly, informed, and patient. In an industry of unsavory types, Sophia stands heads and shoulders above the rest as an excellent Mazda representative. John, the manager, went out of his way to make sure I felt comfortable and confident in my purchase. Even the finance guy (they're never known for their warmth) Ryan was fantastic. He was informed but also friendly and kind. Sophia, Ryan, and John made a challenging, lengthy process an absolute joy. 

My only criticism of my time at Star Mazda was some brief interaction with another manager, an Asian older man, who a month earlier came to me with ridiculous prices that nearly put me off Star Mazda completely. When I finally purchased this new car and had to deal with him, he wouldn't acknowledge me let alone smile when he was told I wanted to do one last check of the car I was handing in. His unpleasant demeanor stands in ugly contrast, quite frankly, to the stellar customer service from his colleagues. I would actually ask NOT to work with him in future dealings with Star Mazda.",4.8

This was the only place that I felt the staff truly listened to my desires and gave honest feedback about pricing and trims for vehicles that would suit my needs. The sales team did not push me to tell them about what I wanted my monthly payments to be, and instead guided me to first find a car I liked before ever discussing pricing options. It just so happens I also fell in love with some of the cars, and from that point forward I had a great experience in finding a finance plan that fit my budget and never once felt pressured to do something out of my limits or comfort zone. Abiel, Francisco and Israel were all incredibly welcoming, kind and helpful. Even Don made the finance signing quick and fun. ",5.0
464,"December 30, 2018","This is about my sixth lifetime new-car purchase and was far and away the best experience I've had car buying. For once there were no surprises. I submitted a request for bids on a new Mazda6 Touring model through True Car. Of the three dealerships that responded only Star's John Maisyan followed up personally with a bid that had everything spelled out--no references to unspecified ""additional costs."" It didn't hurt that their total price was just shy of the lowest price shown on True Car for my model in my area. I had also run my trade-in through Kelly Blue Book for an Instant Cash offer. As it happened, an offer for my trade-in also came from Star and was also very favorable. I made an appointment with John. I brought prinouts of his bid as well as the Kelly Blue Book offer and we were off and running. I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop and it never did. The car was in stock, the bid was honored as written as was the KBB offer on my trade-in. Jon Mach stepped in briefly to propose an easy solution to a minor hitch on my trade-in. Everything was going so smoothly it only made me look ahead with dread to the F&I meeting, but Ryan, who handled the transaction, put me at ease immediately. He didn't unduly push any of the cost-added extras. He had a (pretty cool) digital desktop that allowed easy review and response to the various offers for extended coverage and the handful of transfer documents that I was able to initial and sign digitally. Throughout he completely and clearly explained everything and gave me as much time as I needed to read and ask questions right up to the sales contract itself. Afterwards, John took as much time as I needed to walk me through the car features with a special emphasis on features that differed from and are the same as those on my trade-in. If you're looking at Mazdas in LA, Star should definitely be on your list of dealerships to check out.",5.0

Got a call about other items that were required to repair or update on my 2012 Mazda 5 pushing 90,000 miles.  All was pretty standard and one repair answered why I was hearing a popping sound.  Only one mishap.  Picked up car before closing on a rainy day, had had wipers replaced.  Left the dealer in the rain in lots of traffic.  Passenger wiper was excellent.  Driver's side wiper sounded like the rubber was solid and just streaked.  Got home and went in to make dinner and forgot.  Next day went across town for an event and same issues with wiper.  Star call to thank me for choosing them and I reported about the wiper.  Received a how to possibly take care of the issue as some clay preservative may be on the wiper, xxxx may be on the window.  My husband check the wiper and the packing plastic blade protector was still on the wiper.  All in all very happy with service and how my car is running.

They got me a Lyft ride to grab lunch while I waited for my car to be serviced, picked me up in their service vehicle when my car was ready and last but not least, my service representative (Nathon Madison) credited my brake service with a great coupon discount! I could not ask for more or better service!

UPDATE
I had to immediately return to Star Mazda the next morning after my car was expertly Services because I got a bolt in my rear tire. I was in financial straights from having to shell out most of my available funds on my break service the day prior. Nathon, being extremely empathetic to my situation went above and beyond the call of duty and made special arrangements for me to receive a whole new tire (due to the low level of tread being a safety issue if it were just repaired)... and I was only charged a minimal installation fee. This was more service than I could have asked for or expected. I literally had to pinch myself!!!

The Service Tea at Star Mazda are simply AWESOME! I recommend them to everyone... they treat you like the STAR of a wonderfully caring family! From the Sales Team to the Service Team... I feel the love??",5.0

663,"September 30, 2018","If you have a Mazda, whether new or old, why not take it to the source? As a dealer and a service provider I feel very comfortable that on matters relating to my Mazda I’m receiving expert care, and all of the right information.  I find that they take my individual needs into account, and have been very accommodating with me on a number of different levels. I have a warranty, and more often than not my warranty covers the majority of my repairs. My only real criticism of Star Mazda is that it is really at the upper end of price. To some extent I believe the old adage, “ you get what you pay for“, however sometimes I do feel that they are not quite competitive when it comes to pricing structure.  Still, having said that, many times I just disregard this concern because I just want to absolutely know that I’m getting an honest and true repair (very specific to my make and model of car ) without the risk of some discount that may cost me later. Other times they miss out on my business because I have to make another choice that is more financially realistic for me. Overall though I think the people at Star Mazda are very caring and decent people who strive to do an excellent job.",3.6

Instead of up-selling or assuming, he was clear about what the issue was, what they could or could not do, and how much all the options were.   They set me up with a lyft to and from the service center to Americana even though I initially said I was going to wait.

Star Mazda's only benefit is their competitive pricing. Other than that they are as sketchy as you imagine a call dealership would be.

We found a Mazda CX5 on their lot with low mileage and a fair price. We wanted to trade in our car and put down a significant down payment. We weren't able to agree on a trade-in value and so my wife and I left the lot without purchasing the car. Later that day they called and came up some on the trade-in. After researching other Mazda dealerships, we believed that the price they were offering was the best amongst all the Mazda dealerships.

The next step was to negotiate financing for the remaining balance. My wife and I are very fortunate and we both have credit scores over 800. Since this wasn't a new car, we didn't have the option of 0% financing. They offered us a very high rate and wouldn't budge much. So we went to Capital One, which is our credit card company. We found a more favorable rate and actually negotiated some additional perks through our CC by going with them. Star Mazda said that they couldn't go any lower. Star Mazda is a preferred dealer with Capital One, so it should be an easy process.

We called our salesperson at Star, told them the rate we negotiated through CO and said we wanted them as our lender. Get the paperwork together and we'll come in the next day to sign. They agreed and we were off. 

Next day we went into the dealership to sign our papers and take our car. Our salesperson was fine. He had been as helpful as a salesperson can be. While waiting Don McCurdy, the Finance Manager, we updated our insurance to reflect our purchase. During that process we were asked by our insurance who our lender would be. We chose Capital One and were presented with addresses to match our lender. We asked our salesperson to verify with Don the lender address. He told us the address that Don chose.

Then we were ushered into Don's office to complete paperwork. This is when it got really interesting. We were there with our 10-week old baby. She's the reason we were upgrading to a larger car. She was in a stroller. Had already been there 45 minutes. She was getting a little fussy and Don asked if the baby was a girl or a boy. We said a girl and he said, ""Oh yeah, girls are the fussy ones. I have three daughters.""

Which fine, not a big deal. Sort of a playful dad banter. Then he goes on to say that his daughter got married this past weekend. We congratulated him. He said, ""I didn't go. She had wanted me to walk her down the aisle but she said she wanted her mother to walk as well, so I refused.""

Then he rants about his three daughters. Rants about how he used to have a female dog but now he has a male dog and it's so much better. Female dogs are terrible.

He looked at our credit score and saw that my wife had a higher score than me and said that it was unusual for the women's to be higher because ""women have more credit cards than men."" 

My wife has an MBA in finance. She is very good with money. In fact, she's the reason I even have a reasonable score. Once I told him that, he asked what my wife did and then belittled what she did. My wife and I continued to look at each other, like xxx. 

We signed and left. We were just happy to get out. We got nearly everything we wanted, so it was a win.

A week later we get a call from Wells Fargo saying that they were the owner of our loan. We thought it was a prank call or someone trying to get us to give them our personal information. So we called Don to get the scoop on what was going on. He didn't return two calls and voicemails.

So we called the store to ask for a manager. They verified that the loan was in fact sent to Wells Fargo, not to Capital One. So the benefits we negotiated were out the window. We spoke with a few managers that weren't very helpful and finally, Don called. He got on the phone with my wife.

He told her that he bundled us with a less favorable loan. At least that's what she got after talking over him because he refused to let her speak. He told her ""not to get excitable"" on the phone. He then told her that he decides where the loans go, she doesn't. 

Needless to say, we're waiting for Star Mazda to change our loan or to at least apologize. They aren't doing either.

If you want to go to Star Mazda, just be aware that they are pretty sexist. They are extremely dishonest and they don't care to have your input when it comes to financing a car. They believe that THEY DECIDE. Not you.",1.4

I am really emotionally distressed since my last night experience in this dealership.
Please please please watch out about this dealership and do not deal with them.
So this is my story….
Last night after spending 8 hours looking for a car, finally we found a pre owned car in this dealership. On the sales tag that was displaced on the car windshield, the car was advertised with limited warranty for 3 months after purchasing. The salesman was a very professional and a nice man. He helped us and answered all questions we asked. We did test drive and decided to purchase the car. 
First of all, we wanted to purchase the car full amount with my credit card without going through leasing or financing with them. However, somehow they were pushing us to pay with my personal check (since they didn’t want to be liable for the percentage the credit card charge them to be extra expense for them). After going back and forth with their nonsense request, then they finally agreed to accept the payment with my credit card!!!!
When we start signing the papers (after 1.5 hours in there), the finance manager put a new sales tag (that says there is no warranty for the car) in front of us and he said “by signing this form you are informed that the dealer sold this car as is and the dealer doesn’t have any responsibility toward this car” !!!!!!!!!!!!
We were surprised. We told him that probably he made a mistake because the initial sales tag on this car was offering limited warranty (for 3 months) on the car. The finance manager denied it and he said there was no warranty on this car from the beginning. 
I called the sales man and asked him that if the car initially was advertised by limited warranty or not and the salesman admitted the limited warranty was included.
The salesman was very surprised and went to the finance manager. I heard that the finance manager was very rude to him and shut him down very disrespectfully. I heard that the finance manager said that they made a mistake to put it on the shield initially and now he decided to not provide the warranty any more.
I went back in the room and told him that even if it was a mistake, since it was advertised that way to the costumer from the beginning, they should honor it to their costumer. 
He rudely raised his voice and told me that he won’t give the warranty back on the car and either I take the car this way or the deal is off. So I refused to sign it and I called off the deal. 
I asked him to give a copy of all papers that I signed for my record (including that 3 months warranty form that initially I signed it in front of the salesman before I went to finance manager office to sign the rest). 
However the finance manager refused to do that. He gave only one and kept the rest. I asked him again politely to give the copy of the rest of the papers to me. I told him that by law he is obligated to give me a copy of any documents that my signature is on it, however, He refused and all of a sudden he stood up from his chair and insulted me by saying ” Get the F… out of my office or he is going to that”.  
I was so shocked that my whole body starts shaking since I never ever been to any place to purchase something for my entire life that an employee treats his costumer that way. He stood up and screaming at me to leave his room. Of course being a 5’5’’ petite female, I felt very unsafe and started recording the rest of the conversation. He kept saying I won’t give any paper to you and leave my office, get out of my office. I went directly to the manager’s office and told him what his finance manager done and he didn’t even get up from his chair to apologize or stop his unprofessional behavior. The only he did to pick up his phone and called that guy from his room and tried to calm him down.
The only person that looked so shamed and shocked was the salesman. He walked out with me and apologized for all the things happened. 
I am still emotionally distressed and so in shocked for their behaviors that I am not even feel confortable that my contact information/singed documents are is still in that company (dealership). 
I really recommend to you not even consider purchasing anything from this dealership because of their upper management team (Department manager/finance manager) are so unprofessional, disrespectful, unprincipled, unreliable and untrustworthy people.

Please “BE AWARE”

730,"January 07, 2012","If you need to buy a Mazda, look no further.  Star Mazda in Glendale is a great place to shop your car.  It is by far the only dealership that is willing to cater to the need of the car buyer.  With deal that can’t be beat, and I would know.  I went through a number of dealerships and found no other dealerships can and willing to beat the price I got from Star Mazda.  There is no extra hassle for the car buyer.  With 4 emails and a confirmation phone call, I got my new car within 24 hours.  

With services like this, Star Mazda is the only dealership I would recommend for anyone who does not want to be tricked by dealerships with bait-and-switch (in inventory and in price) and the long hours to make you cave in to them.  

If you want the best price and a service with efficiency and hassle-free, Nick (Nickolas Mongeau – Internet/Fleet Manager) is the guy you are looking for.  Ask a quote from Nick, He will work a great deal for you. I drove all the way from Orange County to Glendale to pick up my car, so you know the price he got for me is amazing and sincere. Thank you, Nick!

Look for Nick, and I guarantee your car purchasing experience will be satisfactory one that will put a smile on your face.

Now I am ready for a drive on my new Mazda3 (skyactiv)!  Zoom Zoom!
