0,"March 27, 2019",Did not follow through with pricing. Did not try to see what I wanted when she couldn't deliver on color or pricing.  I felt disconnected with the conversation between us. Didn't bother to go the dealership. I was off puted by her non reactive mannerisms. Didn't try to earn my business. No professionalism whatsoever. Not coming here again. No stars earned here but I have no choice to put one at least.,1.0

5,"November 13, 2018","When I contacted Winn Hyundai, from nothern California I told the person on the phone I wanted to talk to a sales manager.  Ali Rawji who was on the phone told me he was the fleet manager.  So I said ok I will work with you.  I told him I was calling from nothern California and told him what I wanted to pay for a Genesis.  Well  it turned out Ali was not a manager of any kind.  He lied to me.  It went down hill from there.  He told me a price for the car I wanted but when the papers were emailed to me the price was different.   Hi lies just continued to the point  I decided I would go to another dealership.
But be fore I did I saw the reviews on  Jane Namkung.  So I called her and told her about my bad experience with Ali Rawji.  She took over my request.  With in a few hours we had finalized on an agreement.  I purchased the car.  Jane was fantastic to work with.

I can not true fully rate the dealer as a whole.  My good experience was with Jane Narnkung.",3.0

9,"August 25, 2018","I bought Elantra, 7 weeks back. There was a discrepancy in the billing. I was promised to get the refund check but struggled to get it until I met Amir Nassif. Though he was not involved in the purchase or any other discussions, he took the responsibility on behalf of WinHyundai and settled the issue within 4 days. Apart from the money it involved, the customer considerations he showed in hearing the issue and settling it amicably is worth mentioning. Great customer care from a Sales person. Who said that all sales person are alike and shows the other face after sales. Here is the man who is very genuine and customer oriented EVEN AFTER SALES !!!! Hats off to him. Thank you Amir.

10,"August 08, 2018","Went to the Service Dept of Win Hyundai in El Monte and felt like royalty.  Raymond was our Service Advisor and he made my husband and I feel like a King and Queen.  

Not only was Raymond professional and courteous when we met him at 8:00 am for our Saturday appointment, he also welcomed our Win Hyundai coupon without hesitation and took the time to speak with us about few observations and concerns we had on our 6-year old vehicle, answering our questions thoroughly and patiently. 

Raymond even allowed us to speak with the Service Technician performing the service on our vehicle, so that we both could be confident that our observations and concerns were clearly addressed.

With that out the way, we were then treated to free coffee, donuts and popcorn with our HD movie while we waited for our service (which seemed like minutes - lost track of time enjoying the movie!). When the work was done, we received the car back washed and ready to go.

With workers like Raymond Zabala and his team on staff, it's easy to see why the Win Hyundai of El Monte remains in the running.  

Thank you Win Hyundai.

14,"July 02, 2018","General Sales Manager Kevin Smith, reacted unprofessional and disrespectful  to my 65 year old father right before signing financial documents.  My father requested to please verify the color of the vehicle he was purchasing, when Mr. Smith came up to us and told us with an arrogant tone of voice stating that the dealership has expended a lot of time looking for a deal for us and that car (with the wrong color) was already being washed and prep.  He also stated that the deal they offered us was applicable only to the vehicle we test drove and that to the specific color my father asked for.  I rate one start to the dealer ship because i can not rate Zero.  

Note: 30 minutes later the salesman called and tried to apologized on behave of his Manager.

30,"March 09, 2018","Looking for a great deal on a car is always difficult, many dealers try to maximize profits and sell you lemons but WIN Hyundai in El Monte Is far beyond those types of dealers! Alex Oh gave me a great deal on my new 2018 Hyundai Elantra. He walked me through the lot showing me the different options I had to choose and found the car that was best for me. I returned a couple months later for an oil change and was helped by Alex once again, he made sure I was satisfied with the car then walked me over to the maintenance center and there I was greeted by Christine. She helped me out with a few questions I had and offered spectacular service! After my car was serviced, she walked me through the service review and what they did to the car and she insisted I asked questions. I really didn't feel like I do at other places where they just want you to go home, on the contrary, she wanted me to feel at home and I truly appreciate that!  The whole team from top to bottom is spectacular! Big thanks to Amir for helping me find the best deal to match with my financial situation and for really being involved in my car buying experience. I've told many of my friends to check out this fine lot and they never hear the end of it! It was a wonderful experience and I would recommend this lot to anyone looking to get a great deal on a car, and also anyone who wants to return to a trustworthy dealer for repairs or maintenance!",5.0

35,"February 20, 2018",We came in to the dealership with some high expectations! We were trying to get out of our over-mileage leases but needed the new vehicles to have the same low payments as our trade-ins. We knew it was a lot to ask for but Jane didn't bat an eye. She was open and candid about our options and I really appreciated that! She worked her tail off to get us what we wanted and at a payment that we were comfortable with. We left the dealership really happy with the service and especially the cars! I would and will highly recommend Jane and Win Hyundai!,5.0
36,"February 05, 2018","I've had the pleasure of being helped by Christine for service on vehicle, and she is just as kind as they come. I loved working with her, she made me feel welcome and comfortable during my wait. I wasn't even in the market for a new vehicle yet and she convinced me to take one for a test drive. Well....2-3 hours later I returned my lease early and purchased a brand new car. Maggie Tellez was beyond helpful, made sure I got a good deal and made my wait pleasurable. Turns out we're almost neighbors and I feel a connection. I'd highly recommend Win in El Monte. Ask for Christine or Maggie.",5.0
37,"February 02, 2018","Like some folks, I don't post reviews unless I have had an exceptionally bad or exceptionally good experience. Happily in this case, my experience was exceptionally fantastic! 

Look, I started this car buying process just over 3 months ago when my lease expired. I went to 4 OTHER dealerships in the LA area and was meet with unknowledgeable sales staff about the cars they sell, ridiculously sophomoric sales managers who can't add, cars not prepped and ready for a test drive... and the list goes on. So I abandoned my search and got an 3-month extension to my lease in utter frustration.

I dreaded starting this process again, but happily my FIRST dealership this time around was WIN Hyundai El Monte. I had a Truecar quote in hand and phoned the dealership and that's when I had the pleasure of Meeting Jane Namkung. She immediately was able to pull up my quote. I told her what I was looking for pricing wise and she ran the numbers and text me the screenshot of her quote with all my discounts (ie., loyalty, etc), not only meeting my budget, but beating it! Over the Phone! (And let me tell you, I was no shrinking-violet when it came price negotiations.)

So, I made an appointment with her on the spot. When I arrived at the dealership, not only was the car I was to buy up front, cleaned and ready for a test drive, but Jane came out to greet me! Wow... What a difference a Dealership and Salesperson make!

I can't say enough abut Jane. She is personable, smart and knowledgeable about her cars AND the financing. She spent extra time to save the deal even though I had added a last minute [finance] feature I had forgot that would have sent me over my budget. But she worked with me and the numbers to actually beat my budget. All the numbers we had agreed to on the phone were quoted exactly. No surprises! I can not tell you how much I am impressed with Jane. Even the dreaded task of dealing with ""Finance"" after the deal was made was, well FUN! Bobby made his after-sale pitches, I took one but no pressure for the rest. He too, was a joyful person. The whole transaction with this sales team was seamless, transparent and exceedingly pleasurable.. 

One final note about the dealership. While I was at their, I was struck by how pleasant everyone was, greeting me and just making me feel... at home. There really is a 'family' vibe here. I had not experienced anything like this at the other 4 dealerships. A testament to the management of this dealership. Even though they were way-out (from me) in El Monte, I felt welcomed, like I was part of their family. 

DEFINITELY MAKE THE TRIP TO THIS DEALERSHIP.

You will be glad--like me--that you did!

38,"January 24, 2018","Christine is professional, always takes care of me in a way that makes me feel special. And I've witnessed her doing the same for all her customers. She is knowledgeable, understanding, always handles my requests, and issues quickly and efficiently.  Win Hyundai is a good dealership, but there are other's closer to me. Because of Christine, i would never consider going anywhere else.  She is the main reason I remain loyal to Win Hyundai.    ",4.8
39,"January 20, 2018","Jane Namkung Is the most amazing person ever! She went above and beyond, literally, to help me lease a Hyundai Elantra. Unlike the other salesmen/women at Hyundai, Jane actually kept in contact with me throughout the whole process and worked with me and for hard on my behalf until I was able to get a vehicle. She apologized for the bad customer service of the other employees at Win Hyundai and definitely turned my experience with Win Hyundai from extremely poor/negative to an amazing experience. I would come back just because of her. I was trying to purchase a vehicle for my veteran husband and had submitted an online application to see if I was approved for the vehicle. Throughout the weeks following the application submission, I received multiple calls/day from various different Win Hyundai employees asking when I would like to test drive the vehicle. When I asked about if I had gotten approved for the vehicle, they would tell me that they didn‚Äôt know but would immediately call me back to check up on the status of the application. None of them ever called me back. None. When Jane called, I was already done with Win Hyundai. When I answered her phone call, I expected to be given the run around all of the other Win Hyundai employees gave. However, instead, she apologized for the poor experience I was having and told me that she would immediately get to work on finding out about my application. I was expecting to not hear from her again, but I was wrong. She not only called me to update me on the status of the application but she also texted me as well. She finally told me I had gotten denied (I had just purchased a brand new vehicle 2 months earlier for myself). Instead of just giving me the bad news and moving along, however, she continued to work hard on helping me finance a vehicle. I told her about my situation and about how I was trying to obtain a vehicle for my husband who is a combat veteran and served our country for 8 years, and had no vehicle to get to and from work. She went through 10 different banks and I got denied by every single one of them. However, she did not give up! She did not give up even after I had. She was eventually, after super hard work, able to get me a vehicle! A new one at that! She is seriously so awesome and I cannot thank her enough for her hard work and for her determined motivated attitude of not giving up. She is sweet on the phone, over text message, and even more so in person. She is so outgoing, friendly, and down to earth. She gave me hope when I had none and I ended up driving off the lot with a brand new Hyundai Elantra, ALL thanks to her! Nobody else at Win Hyundai was able to do any of what she did for me, not even close. You should have seen the joy in my husband‚Äôs eyes when I brought him his brand new car, he was so grateful and thankful. Seriously, Jane is a boss! She deserves to be promoted to the very top, she is that awesome in every single aspect! ",5.0

She was true to her word.  Within 45 minutes the problem was resolved and we were on our way.  That time included washing our car.  We had never seen a Service Manager so pro active before and we really appreciated it.

47,"December 28, 2017","My partner and I arrived at win Hyundai and where immediately treated like family. We were greeted by a representative named Alex who was very honest and up front with us regarding the entire process.

We ended up purchasing a 2018 Hyundai Sonata SE and immediately fell in love. This vehicle was not only the color we wanted but had all the features we wanted and the price range we were looking at. To our surprise the vehicle is obtaining much better gas mileage than what the sticker stated. Currently I am getting over 40 miles per gallon on the highway and combined with City I'm averaging around 33 miles per gallon.

We were initially interested in a hybrid but went with the Sonata instead. I am very happy with our decision as this Sonata is getting the gas mileage of a hybrid although it is not a hybrid. I highly recommend this dealership.

Another thank you and shout out to the representative Alex the finance team and their general manager for working with my partner and I getting the vehicle we wanted considering the credit situation we had.",5.0

259,"June 06, 2017","Man the customer service in this place has gone down hill. Especially on the service side... This is honestly the first bad review I have ever wrote. Typically I'm very cordial, calm, and civil about things. 

Today was the worst experience I have ever had.... I went in to get service done on my vehicle today, and the maintenance rep was texting on her phone for 10 minutes before she gave any assistance. Secondly, one of my sensors in the back got pushed in and I asked her if the service guys could put it back into place. Immediately she stated ""You will have to pay for that."" Now when Rick was my service advisor, he would first go through the car and if anything was needed, he would explain thoroughly what was needed and my options.  After waiting an hour and a half just for an oil change and hoping they would do something with the sensor, she came back and said they tried to work on it and I needed a new sensor. ($140). Now the price didn't bother me if it was needed... When I went to my car after they said it was finished, I noticed the back sensor wasn't even touched. I went home and literally put it back in its place and it works fine... So now not only do I feel I am being screwed but the lack of work ethic from this dealership is inexcusable.  

Last year I purchased a 2015 Sonata Limited 2.0T from Raymond and because the service was so outstanding, My fianc√© and I went in not a week later and leased a veloster from him. The service was so great that I didn't even argue the sticker price on the sonata. I appreciate great customer service and loyalty to their customers. We were honestly wanting to be life long customers and was really contemplating upgrading to a Genesis soon. Now I'm not so sure that's going to happen with WIN Hyundai. 

A little advice to the people in service (Amber Morales) ... Give your customers your undivided attention. Make them feel welcomed and not a burden. When they ask for something small, do not immediately go into demands. By all means... if you have a customer waiting to be helped, put your cell phone away. You are on company time... not personal... If you provide great customer service, you will have life long customers...

Patrick Dooney &

He showed me the sheet that had the manufactures recommended price and the dealer invoice amount on it and indicated that Costco base price would be invoice less $700 but when we got to finance it does not appear they deducted the $700. Partly my fault as it was a long time from when we got to the dealer to when we got to finance! Too long and it was then early evening (about 7:00 PM - arrived at 4:00 PM) and my wife and I were tired and since we were paying cash I didn't pay enough attention to the numbers and didn't catch what I believe to be the error until the next day.

I was given the fair market rate for my Honda trade in and wasn't pressured to buy any extras by the fiance department.     Kudos to Clint for staying in contact with me to check and see how I was doing with the car and if I had any questions.

I also noticed and appreciate that the delearship employs a multiethnic and multilingual group of people. It is also intimidating walking into a dealership that is typically predominately male and so it was comforting that the first time I stopped by WIN to tentatively check things out it was a female salesperson who approached.

So I submitted the web request via their website and I was contacted by a very sweet lady named ""Maggie Tellez"" who's business card says she's their internet and fleet manager. After going through the motions with them, letting them see my bank statements and run my credit they got me an approval which I found to be an amazing surprise considering im fresh off a discharged bank ruptcy. Then Maggie told me that her finance manager said it was a today only approval that they bank would not approve it tomorrow. ""This was my first red flag, in my 31 years of age I have purchased a couple different cars and have never heard that one before."" So after some talking back and forth I left I promised id call back before their close time of 9pm. I went home got online and found that auto loan approvals are good for 30 to 60 days depending on the bank. I sent Maggie a text message saying their finance guy is lying to me and that if he wants to be straight forward with me and gets me a lower monthly payment ill go sign paperwork tonite. Via text message Maggie admitted that they are trying to meet a daily sales quota and I admonished that they are trying to meet their quota with deception and scare tactics. She said it was not her, that it was in fact her sales manager who made that decision. I told Maggie that I found that unprofessional and  not honorable.

He found the exact car I wanted and had it ready to go when I arrived. After completing the obligatory paperwork, Clint gave me a thorough tour of the car, hooked my phone up to Bluetooth and I was on my way.

I didn't even really care for the car. I felt overwhelmed and just wanted to leave. After that experience I was not looking forward to going to another dealership. I was referred to Win by a friend who works in the parts department, Adrian Iniguez. The min we (boyfriend and I) got there I felt at ease. We were welcomed by Jesse Murhuia. He asked me what I was looking for in a car and knew I was looking at two cars, the Hyundai Elentra and the Electra GT. We tasted drove both cars and he broke down each car and their features. He was so wonderful through the whole process. Never once tried to push me into another car and kept things easy and simple. I ended up falling in love with the 2016 Elentra. I knew this was my car. After that Jesse walked me through the financial part and with in a few mins we were talking with Bill in the finance department, signing papers. Everyone at Win Hyundai was real amazing. I got my car with a full tank of gas and a fresh car wash. They made buying my first car so memorable. Thank you

I did not like the fact that the protection ""lease"" coverage was not explained at the beginning, they tried to add it during the final signing, although they did include the minimum after I complained and did not want to complete the deal, the car was not completely clean when it was delivered (smudges, lots of finger prints and sticky crud on trim under doors) the electronics were not thoroughly explained which would have been VERY HELPFULL, I am still reading and figuring out the navigation system the stereo settings and personal preference for other settings ... besides that, over all I am very happy with the value of car and the handling of the deal at WIN, go see Arlen he was great!",4.0

537,"January 29, 2014","As a customer, you go when you have time, not on the sales reps availability.   He sells cars for a living. He should already know its a number game. What he wrote is very unprofessional.  Below is what he responded back to me when I sent him a courtesy email that I have purchased my vehicle somewhere else.  Basically, he is telling me that I lied and wasted his time.  He represents the company and that dealership. This dealership needs to train their sales on how to handle rejection.  If you can't handle rejection then this is not the job for him.  I will never go back to this dealership or tell any of my friends to go there.  I rather travel far to get better treatments and services.  

The unprofessional email I got from him:

""Thank you for letting me know that you bought it somewhere else .I also thank you for spending the time with me on Saturday which is one of our busiest days I have to make a income . Since we could not make a deal and you say that you bought it for cheaper when we check everyone's pricing daily . That means you got such a ""unbelievable"" deal on the XXXX . That we don't even believe it . I hope that next time you test drive and the salesmen takes his time to show you a vehicle . You at least give him the courtesy of earning your business. People think we make our money on test drives but we make nothing unless we sell you a car but thank you again for coming on the busiest day to take time from me making another sale . Thanks again and enjoy your XXXXX!""""
