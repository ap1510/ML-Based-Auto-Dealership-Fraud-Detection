55,"December 24, 2019","I had been in the market for a car for about a month. I had previously been with BMW/Mini for the last 10 years and leased 3 different vehicles from them. When my lease was up, I had planned on releasing either a BMW or Mini. Unfortunately, not only were their lease deals expensive, they offered little to no customer loyalty cash / rewards towards a new vehicle. 

I never saw myself as a ""Mercedes Guy."" I thought they were too far over my budget and not sporty enough. I was completely wrong about that. My super fantastic sales associate (John Blackledge) gave me a deal so good that no other car company could come close (includes Subaru, VW, BMW, Audi, Mini). He had my 2020 GLA250 deal completed over email and even found me the color and options I wanted. The next day, I found my shiny new car with a bow in front of the dealership waiting for me...WOW!!! Excellent, no pressure sales person. I cannot stress how wonderful my experience was with John at Long Beach Mercedes.

I also wanted to commend Jose Quintana for helping me learn the tech on the car. He is a very patient, attentive and knowledgeable advisor. Also a shout out to parts specialist Jovanny for helping me track down roof racks for my car. I truly appreciate your help!",5.0

70,"November 06, 2019","Nick was amazing. He listened attentively to my concerns and addressed them accordingly. I couldn’t ask for a more professional and knowledgeable person to be my advisor. I would like to give him the highest marks possible.
However, I’m very disappointed at the fact that I was charged $8.72 for gas reimbursement. I did in fact refuel the loaner car with an amount  I thought was substantial . I only wish someone would have told me I needed to add more fuel. I’m not at all happy about being charged dealer gas prices . I would have gone to another gas station and spent less money. This is my 4th purchase from Long Beach Mercedes and this is actually the first time I didn’t feel valued by your dealership . I hope to get over my disappointment soon. This is giving me serious second thoughts about where to get my next service and purchase from. It’s the principle and I do accept responsibility for my error. I should’ve asked if everything was ok when I returned the loaner car. 
Thank you for checking out my review, Donna Dixon, a loyal and faithful customer ",5.0

76,"October 24, 2019","My husband and I researched and test drove a number of cars in our search for a new car. We went with a Mercedes in large part because of the quality of the car, but also because of the service we received. There wasn’t any pressure to buy from them. We were told the price to purchase the car and we either accepted it or not. The price was less than the Genesis and Lexus that we were looking at. We returned a second time to look at other models and actually purchased a higher end Mercedes than we had anticipated because the quote was unbeatable.

I trust Dez and this is the second vehicle I've purhased from him.  I've kept in contact over the years since my first purchase in 2009 of a new  C350.  Periodically, I'd contact him regarding a particular vehicle on MBZ website.  He never made me feel like I was wasting his time,

We came down from the Central Coast, based on our trust in Dez for the purchase of the GLK350.

Whatever he's earning at MBZ Long Beach, his salary should be doubled.  He's excellent in customer service and a tremendous asset to MBZ Long Beach.

We went to many dealerships over a few day period to drive every mid size SUV on the market. I can tell you without a doubt the best dealership experience and salesman we dealt with was at LB Mercedes. The salesman went as far as telling us to pull into the Dodge dealership next door and park next to a Jeep Grand Cherokee Altitude to compare them since my wife was stuck between the two choices. We did not do it but it was nice that the salesman was not just trying to sell us a car he wanted us to get but the best car for us and best car for the price point. We made several trips to the dealer and changed what exterior and interior combo my wife wanted three times and our salesman gave us the best car selection for each request over a three day period until we finally signed the papers.

I purchased a used vehicle and despite the relatively low sales price of the car, I was treated the way you would expect when buying a $250K S65 AMG by Toshi Sato, the Fleet Sales Manager. After speaking with Toshi on the phone, I had a good feeling about working with him and decided to drive up with my wife from San Diego County. We were treated like V.I.P's as soon as we walked in the door by the entire staff including David - sales manager, Kennet - service technician, Robert - service manager, Erin - finance/contracts and Toshi's charming wife Lisa who handled the paperwork. Toshi could not have been more professional, courteous, thoughtful or efficient. It was no surprise to learn afterwards that he sells more Mercedes than anyone else in the world (not a typo). We are very happy with the car we bought and grateful for the great deal Toshi and David gave us. As an engineer who does most of the service and repairs on my cars, I was very impressed with the service group and their work area. I totally understood why Toshi stated how proud he was of the entire team at Mercedes Benz of Long Beach. I don't write many reviews but mostly do so to help other consumers (mostly warning them about negative experiences) so it is with great pleasure that I highly, highly recommend contacting Toshi Sato and this dealership if you are considering a new or used vehicle.",5.0

Nobody wants to spend money on the upkeep of their cars, I know I don't. But at least this year a had a Service Advisor that was friendly , concerned and kind to me. That might not mean a lot to some people, but to me, it means a lot. Thank you Rebecca for making me feel welcomed at Long Beach Mercedes.

The receptionist asked me for my info and she couldn’t find my info in the system. She transferred me and didn’t let me know, I was tossed back and forth between calls not being answered, I became frustrated, hung up and scheduled an appt online. When I arrived at my appt time and date, it was very busy. I let the gentleman at the counter know of my appt time. He allowed me to go in front of the long line. Not long, Selene Torres came to help me. She asked if I was getting picked up or getting an Uber. I let her know I requested a loaner when I booked my appt online. She then stated, they may not have a loaner since I booked online. I instantly became upset and explained to her about my call in and my experience with them so far is not going well. She apologized for the experience and said should would take care of me and provided her contact info to call her direct for further service appts. She kept me informed through the entire service process. Thank you turning what started experience into a great experience and made sure I was taken care of.

Approximately 8 months ago, I purchased my first Mercedes from Mr Toshi Sato and his lovely wife, Lisa. We were so impressed with the quality of business and care Mr Sato gave me, that, we came back to lease my wife a GLE 350. We have always been Tahoe customers, but since meeting Toshi and Mercedes of Long Beach, I will NEVER be without an automobile from Mercedes of Long Beach. With the impecable service that Toshi provided us and the incredible deal and prices, I have never been more satisfied with buying a car! Once I got to the financial department, Erin Say insured that I got a great interest rate and made sure that we got the perfect extended warranty, to insure no hidden costs in the future. The service department is 2nd to none! They take care of the automobile that your Mercedes deserves and Taidy only did the necessary service without tacking on unnecessary costs and repairs.

526,"March 19, 2018","We stopped to look as we were contemplating a new car, but what encouraged us to buy was the service.

Too frequently, when you begin the journey of purchasing a new vehicle, you can feel smothered and pressured by the sales people at the dealership.  We get it- you make your living by selling the car, but all to often, something that should be fun turns into dread rather quickly.

We were welcomed by Nael Issa when we arrived.  We made it clear, we were just looking and if we had questions we would come to him.  Imagine our surprise when he said, ""absolutely, take your time!"" and fell back.  There was zero pressure, there was time to look, digest and make decisions without feeling the salesmans breath on the back of our necks or feel like we were being stalked.

After about twenty minutes Nael came to check on us which felt very organic.  He answered our questions, was very entertaining and quite genuine.  To be honest, he was hilarious and we had a wonderful time with him!  He kept us in stitches!! We must say, it was the most pleasurable experience either one of us have had buying a car; that says quite a bit because between the two of us we've purchased an S500, SL500, E320 several BMWs, etc..  Not even the other Mercedes purchases came close to this level or courtesy or service.

With that being said, we are both pleased with our handsome new E350 and we are both looking forward to our next purchase with Issa in the coming months.

Accolades abounding for Nael and the finance manager who moved at a blur whipping together our contract and taking payment in time for us to make our dinner reservations.

Recently moved to America and will be trading my GTI up to something a lot more comfortable. The sales rep guarding the door Steve S. took me aside and was instantly cold and uninterested - possibly owing to my jeans and tshirt and age (29). 
Made it clear that I will be buying a top end luxury car but am just researching as I've got 6 months til the VW is done. and I'm yet to decide on the Model S, LS, A8l or 550. Id even asked him to get my details so I could test drive an E class with the upgraded suspension - he never took down my info.

He than called me an hour later and said my vehicle was ready, but it needed a new battery.  I asked how much and he told me it would be $247.  Less than 40 minutes later, he calls to say my car is ready.  Im surprised at the cashier with a $604 repair bill.   The service rep tells me it costs $202 in labor (less than 40 minutes) to change a battery.  Really?!  Dishonest!  I ask what the hourly labor rate is and I'm told it's a flat rate.  Hmmm....I wonder what the CA Bureau of Auromotive Repair would think about that one!   The Setvice Advisor tries to tell me it's an exhausting process and the seat must be removed.  Dishonest again!  Maybe he should watch the 8 minute YouTube ""How to"" video to see how it's done.  Yes...it took only 8 minutes and the seat does NOT have to be removed.  First...I was told it was $247.  I arrive to pick up my Mercedes & I'm told I CAN'T have my car back unless I pay $449 for a new battery!   I ask to speak to the manager...of course there is none available because it's Saturday at 4:45pm.  I ask them to call their manager.  Of course...he's not available.   So I leave the dealership with no car for the entire weekend and no way to get to work on Monday because the Service Advisor told me the battery was $247 on the phone, but added an additional charge making the battery change total a whopping $449.   He demanded I pay $449 or I couldn't have my car back.  I told him to put my old battery back into the car, but they refused.   LADIES....DO NOT TRUST THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT AT THIS DEALERSHIP.  They think we're all stupid and can overcharge us for the simplest things.

I did lease a new one in the color that I love with the exact package options on the car that I can only dream of  (make sure you walk all around the lot - I found my dream car hiding behind employees cars, almost like someone was saving it).  Dez made the experience very easy and he was not at all pushy in his demeanor.

Dez (Internet sales for MB of Long Beach) was the best thing that ever happened to Mercedes Benz of Long Beach.  He was extremely helpful and informative about the car I was about to lease (2012 Lunar Blue E-350 with all the bells and whistles).

I selected Mercedes Benz of Long Beach because it was my closest dealer and I assumed prices would be similar at all dealers in the area.  The man in the parts department quoted a price of $259 dollars which was higher than the price I had been quoted elsewhere but since I would save time, I was planning to pay that price.  Then he explained that after the key arrived, it would be necessary to bring the car in to have the key programmed -- another $65 charge.  That would be a total of $324 for a lost key.  I challenged this fee and was told it was Mercedes policy.  Then I refused on principle and left.  I then contacted Laguna Niguel who had quoted $250 for a lost key and asked whether there would be a programming charge and was told no.  

I recontacted the parts dealer at MB of Long Beach to point out that they were absurd in their pricing and was told that MB of Laguna may be different because there is a different owner.  I pointed out the reason they told me about the pricing was that it was Mercedes policy.  

Later I decided to contact MB of Newport Beach, expecting the highest price, and was surprised to learn that the cost was $234 with no programming charge.  

In addition to the price differences in the area, MB of Long Beach said it would take three to four days from the time I placed the order, MB of Laguna Beach said it would take two days, and MB of Newport Beach said it would take one day if the order was placed before 1 pm.
