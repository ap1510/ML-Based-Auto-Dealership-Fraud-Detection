58,"November 19, 2017","Thanks Mo and David for make it exceptional 
I returned my leased Hyundai nine months early, even though I was pleased with it, because I wanted to take advantage of the opportunity to ""trade up"" to a newer model. Not only am I happier with the new car - and am enjoying the improvements and refinements of the past two years - but the trade made sense practically and financially. 
I came in to the dealership mostly out of curiosity, and am surprised that it could be done so effortlessly. I am very pleased with my new car, and with the support I received from the people who worked with me to make it happen.",5.0

60,"November 18, 2017","Once again, Armen and the service department have gone out of their way to meet our (vehicle) needs - so we keep coming back. Yes... the department is clean, the work is completed by trained professionals, the car is washed before return... however it's the extra things that make this a five-star dealership. Today's example: the service tech wasn't fully satisfied with the diagnostic computer's report and called additional resources to find out what may have caused our 'intermittent' problem - not only did he go the extra mile, the team communicated with us every step of the way. Thanks again, Armen and the entire service department team.",4.8
61,"November 18, 2017","My buying experience at Keyes Hyundai went very well. It was quick, efficient, and successful. My sales guy, Jonathan put my in a car that met my expectations. The entire dealership, from the manager to Finance, assisted me every step of the way. Thank you!",5.0

I would definitely recommend my family and friends to Jonathan!,5.0
63,"November 17, 2017","Bought a pre-certified Sonata a month ago. On the day of test driving the car, noticed the low tire pressure warning was ON.Checked with the sales person about the same and he said he will have it fixed. Purchased the car the next day. All going on for two weeks and the low tire pressure warning was there again. I thought it’s one off situation and then it came again after another two weeks. Took the car back to dealer which is one month old. Apparently this issue pre-existed in their so-called pre-certified car on my opinion. however, the manager denied it stating even new cars get some problem immediately and that they are responsible. 
The car was checked by the Service department and the person found out there is a big hole in the tire and it has to be replaced and I had to pay for it. Later when the sales manager questioned how come the warning keeps coming only after 2 weeks if there is a big hole , the service person took a U turn and said the hole is not big. It’s a minor hole and it can be fixed by a private tire shop and Hyundai service cannot do that as per policy.",1.0

65,"November 17, 2017",I have had my 2013 Elantra serviced at Woodland Hills Hyundai...so it was natural for me to checkout the dealership for my new 2018 Elantra GT that I researched.  Micheal Reardon was very professional and answered all my questions regarding the car.  The test drive made me happy about my choice.  The sales staff worked with me in a stress free manner to finalize my purchase.  I would recommend Woodland Hills Hyundai.  I will be coming back to the dealership for my maintenance.,5.0
66,"November 16, 2017","Brandon Kugelman, service manager, and Matt Winston, Service Director, were amazing. Had some serious issues with my Equus. A rodent got into the engine and car - caused lots of damage. They were great - kept me in the loop, dealt with my insurance company and are just great people. I would highly recommend Keyes Woodland Hills Hyundai to anyone that wants great service. I have owned may Lexus, Mercedes, BMWs etc. and while those companies have great service, Brandon and Matt were ever better to deal with regarding my car. Thanks for all the help!

69,"November 13, 2017","My daughter and I were there as my car needed an oil change.  I had made an appointment in advance.  we arrved early (as I tend to do) and we were greeted very nicely at the door   Though every one was on the phione when we arrived they were cordial and explained that we would wat a few minutes.  As soon as someone came available we were told what was needed and escorted to the waiting area.  Cool new coffee machine, cold water, fruit and cookies avauiable.  the waiting area was quite cliean.  though we thuought we wuold be there an hou and a half we were done with in an hour.  everything was good with the car.  I was clearly explained the checklist and when I may need service.  car looked great when we opicked it up.  The only thing that would have made my experioence a little better would have been some outlets as my phone was dieing.

70,"November 12, 2017","Very great customer service! Warren and Moe helped me through the whole process and made sure I got the car that I wanted interior and exterior color. They didn't pressure me to buy right away, but gave me some time to think before I made my decision.",5.0
71,"November 11, 2017","This car dealership went completely beyond my expectations.   The other dealerships I had been to were nightmares of weird salesmen playing games.   I walked into Keyes Hyundai and was immediately greeted by the accessible, relatable Mike Reardon.  He took me on a test drive and I was just as impressed by the car as I was by his friendliness and honesty.   Michael then called in industry-veteran George to work the numbers which were approved by overall-manager Taimur Amin.   I don't remember the last time I have been as impressed by another business-person as I was by Mr. Amin. Taimur is simply one of the most fair-minded and caring people I have ever had the pleasure to work with (more on this in a moment). After settling on terms, I was quickly shuttled over to finance manager David Sarkissian.  Instead of adding lots of cost and needless paperwork, Mr. Sarkissian made the process as streamlined and fair as possible, finding ways to provide me with even more value.   While all of this was taking place, I was able to enjoy apples, cold bottled water, coffee, and freshly-baked cookies (???) in a clean, modern, well-lit showroom that, in terms of comfort, is head and shoulders above the Toyota, Chevy, and Lexus dealerships I visited.  [I'm not going to mention that I got a high-end luxury hybrid for half the price I would have paid for a Prius or a Volt.]  The day afterward I had a question about the car. Taimur Amin reached out to me personally (on his day off!) to resolve the issue and I assure you that if the issue hadn't been fully resolved, Mr. Amin would still be working on it to this day.   If you want to have a good car buying experience with NORMAL, NICE people who are trying to HELP you get a great deal, at a dealership that actually CARES, please go see Michael, David, and Taimur at Keyes Woodland Hills Hyundai. A week later, I'm still blown away by their kindness, caring, camaraderie and professionalism.",5.0

74,"November 04, 2017",I visited this dealer at 3:45pm today. I asked for sales manager. A friendly person named Armen tried to help me. He talked to sales person or manager about my request. He came back and asked me to wait for manager in waiting area and stated manager would be with you as soon as possible. I was looking at sales room when wating for manager for 10 min. They were not with any other client. Two people were talking together and laughing and another person who Armen spoke with him about my request was busy with his phone pictures!!!! As my time is valuable to me I left the dealer with dissatisfaction.,1.8

81,"October 30, 2017","I have been leasing cars for approximately 30 years.  The staff at Hyundai of Woodland Hills was, without question, the most professional, courteous and helpful of any dealership with which I have done business.  My sales person, Michael Reardon, in addition to the Manager and Finance person who worked with me to finalize our deal and to deliver the vehicle to me, were top-notch in all respects.  I very much appreciated the fact that they listened to my issues, priorities and desires, did all they could to address them, and were the most professional in their approach.

91,"October 13, 2017",To start I think I have the best service rep Armen. He is patient and kindly answered the questions I had and made sure the questions were answered to my understanding. He made sure I was comfortable while my car was being serviced. When my car was ready he reviewed the services provided and asked if I needed clarity about anything that was to my car. He said if there was anything I needed or thought about later to feel free to give him a call. He then thanked me for choosing Keyes. GREAT customer service from Armen! ,5.0

94,"October 09, 2017","Let's begin with--- I love my Santa Fe.  My appointment and the scheduled service was on time, and I presume all things were in excellent condition.  But with that said, I also came with a short list of technical issues that continue to out smart me.  Johnny Ramirez was wonderful in assisting me, and when a couple of tries didn't work, we drove into the service bay and your mechanic solved the problem. What remains is a tricky navigation system.  Fortunately I have a sense of humor, and a reasonable familiarity with where I am going.  I've been told that the Navigation System tends to have a mind of its own.   
The most important part of the review is that your service department is prompt, efficient and accurate, and that your service advisor made every possible effort to see that the client was happy.",5.0

104,"September 24, 2017","Bought a pre-certified Sonata a month ago. On the day of test driving the car, noticed the low tire pressure warning was ON.Checked with the sales person (Mo) about the same and he said he will have it fixed. Purchased the car the next day. All going on for two weeks and the low tire pressure warning was there again. I thought it’s one off situation and then it came again after another two weeks. Took the car back to dealer which is one month old. Apparently this issue pre-existed in their so-called pre-certified car on my opinion. however, the manager denied it stating even new cars get some problem immediately and that they are responsible. 
The car was checked by the Service  department and the person found out there is a big hole in the tire and it has to be replaced and I had to pay for it. Later when the sales manager questioned how come the warning keeps coming only after 2 weeks if there is a big hole , the service person took a U turn and said the hole is not big. It’s a minor hole and it can be fixed by a private tire shop and Hyundai service cannot do that as per policy. ",1.6

This was our first stop of the day so we let him know we needed to look at other cars for comparison. We noticed a plug-in hybrid on the lot and asked him a question with regard to rebate credit that he didn't know the answer to so he introduced us to Navid who was busy but stopped to kindly answer our question. We went on our way feeling good about the (no pressure) experience. After our research, lunch and further discussion we decided to come back and test the hybrid with Warren. It was clear to us that this would be a good fit for us.

169,"July 08, 2017","My salesman, Mo Alam, was great! He called me just as he said he would when the car I wanted arrived at the dealership. I'm pretty sure that if it wasn't for Mo, I wouldn't have been able to get the Ionic Electric. I am so grateful! He was extremely helpful and emailed me multiple times afterwards to check on me and see if I had any questions about the car. He made it a very easy process and always got back to me when he said he would.   Ali in Finance was very nice and friendly and the checkout process was easy, but I felt like I knew a little more about the lease terms of the Ionic Electric than he did. I believe they only sold/leased one more before mine, but maybe they could have been more informed about the Unlimited lease.  I leased two electric cars over the years and it's important to get the license plate number in order to apply for the carpool lane sticker. Both dealerships I worked with prior informed me as soon as they received my license plate number. However, when I called Ali to ask for this, he told me his DMV person was not in and I needed to call back the following week. He didn't offer to find out for me and call me or email me. It was my responsibility to call. So I checked in the following week and the DMV person again was not there so I left a voicemail on her phone. I didn't even know she had voicemail previously. I left more messages and I was a bit frustrated since I have a long commute and needed those stickers. I eventually gave up and went to my local AAA Club and they were able to get the number for me through their DMV services. Something that I feel like the dealership should have done. It took two weeks since my first call before Ali got back to me and I already had the number. So that was a bit frustrating. If I could make a suggestion, it would be to have a process in place in the future when selling electric or hybrid plug-in cars to supply the buyers their license plate numbers as soon as they come in. That way they could apply for their stickers before receiving their plates in the mail.   Overall, I was really happy with the experience. I think the fact that I was getting an Ionic Electric with the Unlimited Lease made the process very easy and smooth.",4.6

229,"March 31, 2017","I purchased a new Elantra from Keyes Hyundai Woodland Hills.  Although I ultimately got a good purchase price for the car, the car buying experience was awful.  Navid gave me false information.  When I pointed out the deception on the purchase contract regarding an owner loyalty rebate, Navid stated it was an honest mistake.  Navid works under the supervision of an entire team of sales managers- mistakes don't just happen.  This was an attempt to rip me off.  I imagine the sales team more often than not gets away with the deception otherwise the sales team would discontinue the practice.
If you an interested in learning more about my new car buying experience, please continue reading.  I purchased a 2017 Elantra Value Edition with an msrp of $21,350.  I negotiated a purchase price of $20,000 minus all applicable rebates.  I knew I qualified for $4250 worth of rebates.  I thought I qualified for an additional $500 loyalty bonus for a total of $4750 but I was told No by Navid.  Believing Navid's answer was truthful, I agreed to purchase the car for $15,750. (20,000 - 4,250 = $15,750)
When I went to sign the contract, this is what the sales team tried to pull off- they raised the car purchase price to $20,500 ($500 more) and now $4750 instead of $4250 in rebates appeared.  The bottom line price was the same ($15,750) but clearly something had changed that I was not told about.   I dug deeper and it turns out that I actually did qualify for the $500 owner loyalty rebate.that 30 minutes earlier Navid said I did not qualified for.  
When I pointed out that I agreed to a car purchase price of $20,000 minus all applicable rebates, the sales team adjusted the price to $15,250.  Had I not pointed out the false information given to me by Navid about the owner loyalty rebate, I am would have overpaid by $500,  
The sales team will claim this was an honest mistake,  I don't agree but judge for yourself.  In my opinion, there are way to many sales managers overseeing the purchase process for these types of mistakes to just accidentally occur.  I believe, the sales team counts on buyers to overlook these types of errors in the dealerships favor in the buyers excitement to drive off in their new car.
I am personally never going to buy another car at a Keyes dealership but if you decide to shop at Keyes, make sure the sales team does not give you misinformation or deceive you.",2.0

The one complain I have with Hyundai is regarding my panoramic sun roof. Apparently they seem to shatter all by themselves and they are not covered under the Hyundai warranty.

My girlfriend had only three days before purchased a car from Navid, and, highly touted him to me when I told her that I, too, was interested in a new Hyundai.  And, Carol was so right! Navid and Gilbert made my time at Keyes wonderful, and, how many customers can say that about leasing or purchasing a car!! 5 stars just isn't enough for this team...I definitely would give the experience a 10!!   And, on top of all else, I love my new Sante Fe SUV, and, am driving around town like a peacock strutting his colorful feathers.",5.0

On August 8, 2015 at about 8:30 a.m. I came in to this dealership with my parents to look at purchasing a Certified Pre-Owned 2013 Hyundai Accent GS.  I did not have a pleasant experience and feel that if I had not had my parents with me who are very experienced car buyers and have bought 4 different Hyundai's I would have been grossly taken advantage of.

Despite hearing negative reviews about this dealership I decided to give it a try.  My salesman (Luis Zappeda) was nice and I do not have anything negative to say about him.  The issue I had was with the upper management.  Specifically Aram Hovhannisyan the Sales Manager and Gregory Miller the Finance Manager.  To begin my experience Mr. Hovhannisyan had the price of the vehicle up to 16k.  This was rediculois when the list price online said 11,888, and is well over the price I could pay for a NEW Hyundai Accent down at Norm Reeves.  He kept trying to charge me for add ons I told him I did not want, and that had already been charged when the car was initially sold to the first owner!  He also had the DMV tags/Fees up to 529.00!!  When we confronted him about the very high cost he could not explain it and tried to brush it off.  Thankfully I had done my research and knew the cost to register this vehicle and get tags was much lower (176 to be exact).  After proving to him the cost was not what he was trying to charge he finally adjusted it.  

Additionally,when he first came with the APR for the monthly payments it was a staggering 7%.  After I finished laughing at this redicoulus attempt, I told him my credit union can easily get the APR down to 2.4%.  He scoffed walked away and low and behold came back a couple minutes later and had a 2.39%.  The fact that he even started with a 7% APR when my credit score is in the high 700's is ludacris, and once again confirms what I have heard about this dealership.  After a lot more nagotiating, the total price of the car finally go lowered to around 14k.  We informed the Salesman and Sales Manager that I can easliy go down to Norm Reeves Hyundai and purchase a brand new Hyundai Accent, get better service, and pay the exact same price.

We finally agreed on a price and moved on to the Finance Manager Mr. Gregory Miller.  This is where my real dissatisfaction comes from.  He was not trust worthy, he was rude to me as well as my family, and he was grossly unprofessional.  Mr. Miller tried to charge me $400.00 to CERTIFY my Certified Pre-Owned Car.  I was furious.  IT IS ADVERTISED AS Certifed Pre-Owned on the website at the dealership.  When my family and I got angry, showed him the paperwork from the car and from online that says it is already a Certified Pre-Owned vehicle he said he would ""honor it"".  As we continued filling out the paperwork we noticed there was nothing about having to pay an extra $400.00!  When trying to sell me the extra monthly warranty, I told him very clearly I was fine thank you and did not want it.  However of course he kept pushing and pushing.  He would not take no for an answer and seemed to get more and more frustrated and began talking down to me and my parents.

He was also very rude to my father and mother, they were helping me through the proccess as I am a first time buyer.  He rudely asked if my mom was an accountant as we were going over numbers and fine print of the contracts.  He later asked what my dad did.  My father is an LAPD Officer.  As soon as Mr. Miller heard that he asked my dad to sign off on a ticket he got.  VERY unprofessional!  My father was taken back as this guy had just tried to rip us off, was being extremely rude and condescending, then wanted him to sign off on a ticket!  My father, however, politely explained that it is the City's policy that Officers are not allowed to sign off on tickets when off duty.  At that point Mr. Miller lost interest and once again became rude.

I recently took my car back in to this dealership as the plastic in the wheel wells was coming loose.  I had another unpleasant experience in the service dept. with Rickia Smith.  She was also rude.  Tried to charge me 68 dollars to reattach some clip.  I specifically told her no do not fix it, as i was not going to pay 68 dollars for that.  I was then left sitting in the waiting area for 2 hours.  I finally noticed my car sitting outside and Mrs. Smith was no where to be seen.  I had to go ASK someone for my car so I could leave.  A guy completed the paperwork, slapped down a pen and receipt and tried to charge me 68 dollars!  I refused to pay as I did not agree to the price and specifically told them not to do anything.  He stared at me, rudely grabbed my keys and receipt shoved them at me and said don't worry about it, just go.

507,"September 06, 2015","I got a great price on a 2016 Hyundai Elantra that I had purchased from a sales-person named Ali at the Woodland Hills Hyundai. However, the price was negotiated on a couple of different models for me by my friend before I came in into the dealership. I feel like the sales person didn't take his time to compare the vehicles, which I had been inquiring about, and when my husband went on a test-drive with him, the sales-person wasn't invested in showing all of the vehicle capabilities. As a result, I purchased a vehicle without a blue-tooth system and a rear-view camera, which now I regret not having and I find the gas paddle to be too tight.  I am not sure if I had purchased the same vehicle model, if I knew all of this before buying. Also, Greg in the Finance Department, when setting us with a loan somehow included a ROAD Side Assistance plan for extra 500 some dollars for the next 3 years, which we didn't discuss. Both my husband and I only realized what had happened on our arrival home, we had to come in the next day on a Sunday and waste another 4 hours to rewrite the contact to exclude the unnecessary -for- my purposes Roadside Assistance plan. I got into a verbal altercation with a staff member named Russel, who was very rude towards me.  Needless to say that the staff was less than eager to help us. The only reason that we were able to cancel the Roadside Assistance plan is because the law was on our side: there was a cancellation clause in the Roadside Assistance Agreement and Because I work in the legal field. I know that my husband and I do not purchase cars every day but I would like like to think that I am not as easily fooled as other people, since I finished law school and work in a law office.  Based on the above, I feel that my experience at this Hyundai dealership was subpar. ",3.4

We were greeted by workers opening and closing the door (Excellent customer service!) front desk offered my daughter some popcorn, and they had delicious sweets!
Cameron Canaan was Gary's right hand man (AWESOME GUY). He made this transaction smooth and our first car purchase a great first experience. Even though the Prius wasn't his expertise it didn't stop him from going ABOVE AND BEYOND with getting us all the answers we needed. I'm excited to forward him any referrals.. He is such a great asset to the company with his great attitude, honesty, and knowledge. ",5.0
546,"March 11, 2015","EVERYBODY wants a GREAT deal~both the consumer and the dealership. This is the genesis where real car buying action begins. But in the end, who is going to be the real winner? 

After six weeks of car shopping at Hyundai dealers from Santa Maria to Pasadena:
I was tired, frustrated, feeing futile AND ready to change to a completely different auto manufacturer. I decided to call and give Keyes Hyundai a try DESPITE another dealer's warning.

What I wanted was a specific model, with specific color(s), and no frills. A base model. 
Nobody had one of these. If they said they had one, you get there and suddenly it's gone, or it's going to ""arrive on the next shipment."" But never does any dealer come up with what the customer wants, EXCEPT Keyes!

Granted, a sales person had to drive to pick up #thecarofmydreams in a dealer swap , but the right sales person and Keyes team made it happen! They cared enough to listen and work to honor their word. They brought the car into my arms all ready for it's new home! Because the entire staff cared, listened to and respected my request, they pushed through every obstacle to make this happen. In fact, they would not allow any obstacles in their way.

I am forever grateful to Aran, Raffi, Michael, Amir and Mike the GM for their humor, respect, persistence and reassurance that they exhibited. 

Rather than being called the dreaded ""Other Side"" of a potential ""nightmare"" sales equation, they became, for me, the possibility that lives in dedicated service and commitment.

Go celebrate guys! I know that I am and will continue celebrating a new car made possible by all of you!",5.0

I recently had the unfortunate experience of having to take my car to another dealer when it starting acting up after I moved 150 miles away. After being ripped off with repairs prices, false needs to buy a new engine and suggested to purchase a new car. The bad dealer crew fixed my spark plugs and sent me on my way. I drove 150 miles to my reliable service providers at Keyes Nissan where my car was fully inspected everything passed with bells and whistles and I can rest confortablely knowing my car is in good hands. Their customer service is extraordinary! They helped me by phone while the rip off dealers service department attempted to make me pay for unnecessary repairs. Oscar my service rep and Bruce the service manager are phenomenal!

551,"June 17, 2012","I was looking for a car and didn’t know exactly what I wanted. I started out with low budget and couldn’t find anyone that would take the time to listen to my needs before recommending me a vehicle. Jean from Nissan in thousand oaks was one that finally understood what I was looking for and not too concerned about making a key sale or large profit. She found me exactly what my wife and me needed considering the gas and economy level.  I would definitely recommend Jean to all off my friend s and family that may be looking to purchase a car in the future. My wife and me had stopped by there recently to let her know how much we appreciated the purchase but she is no longer there. A sales person told me she transferred to Woodland hills Nissan.  I know where wee will be going when it comes time for a trade in.  Thank you Nissan and thank you Jean.

553,"March 13, 2012","I cannot rate Mitch Freeman, Internet Manager and this dealership highly enough! I had just totaled our 2003 Altima that I loved, on February 8, 2012 and needed a car soon, so I could turn in my rental. 
 
I checked out other dealers, one with a car that I was ready to buy, that after the initial conversation would not return my calls...and they were a referral from Costco’s certified pre-owned car program.

I responded to a used Altima Ad posted on Motovy search site and Mitch immediately called me at home. We discussed the 2008 Altima with low mileage and other vehicles that might work for my husband and me. I liked him right away because he was very knowledgeable...having spent the last twenty years in marketing and sales of Nissan cars, but most important, he came across as a very up-front, easy going and honest person who answered all of my questions.

After we had been talking for awhile, Mitch asked me if I had thought of leasing a new car. I said we had done that back in the 90s buying a Nissan 240SX. He explained the benefits of leasing a 2012 Altima. The “bumper-to-bumper” warranty except for maintenance upkeep and the fantastic leasing price that worked into our budget, sold us on the deal over the phone.

We met at the Keyes Woodland Hills Nissan dealership the next night. Mitch greeted us at the front door and welcomed us in. He gave us a tour of this large, beautiful facility so we could pick the right color car for us. We then went outside and test drove the Altima that we leased and drove home.

Everyone was so friendly and professional with the energy being upbeat but not that hard core sales attitude of many dealerships...which I do not like. We met Mike Lahhan, the General Manager and of course, the Financial Manger, Edward and they, like Mitch, are all about the customer, establishing a relationship and not about just selling a car.

So if you are thinking about leasing or buying a new or pre-owned car, come to Keyes Woodland Hills Nissan and they will make your experience the best you have ever had. Oh...and the hot chocolate on a chilly night was delicious!
