While they've ceased free  delicious coffee and customer home return and pick-up that was very useful for me (partially disabled) my very recent simple service visit could not have been quicker or more  stress free.

7,"March 17, 2020","Took my car in to get it checked due some metal parts hanging from the undercarriage after just getting it serviced at that dealership. 
 Randy was extremely rude accusing us of lying about it and saying we had ran something over.  Saying he sees it all the time and that we were lying and he began making a big scene.  We weren't there asking for money or anything.  We just wanted to see if it could be lifted and maybe screw in the parts because that's what it looked like it was missing.  Supervisor came and asked for it to be lifted.  It was eventually lifted and it was found that the mechanic did not screw in those metal parts and that's why they were dangling.  Randy never apologized for assuming and accusing us of trying to scam them.  Overall really rude and unprofessional.  Never been treated like that by employee at any dealership ever.",1.0

15,"February 28, 2020","Very disappointing service. The service agent forgot about me until 2.5 hours later, when I approached her. I then found out parts had been ordered, so nothing was actually done except an oil change and standard service. If I hadn’t approached her, I’d still be waiting. At checkout the servicing performed wasn’t reviewed - I don’t know about tire wear or brake wear readings, I don’t know if recall maintenance was done, it was a rapid check out trying to “make good” for forgetting about me. I’ll be going to a different dealer moving forward. Sorry, Star Ford, the “service” in your Servicing sucked.",1.0

92,"August 17, 2019","I was forced to  buy  a car in rush to replace my favorite Crown Victoria. This was to be my last car I would ever buy (I am 90), relying on advise of others and unfortunately without doing my own homework. The dealer was extremely helpful explaining all the  electronic gadgets to my son (not to me) and taking us to the car lot with all available Fusion cars. None of them were fully as per my liking and I can blame only myself for not  having asked to show me and test drive another model. The Ford Taurus  from the look of it might have been  perhaps more to my liking and to what I have been used to.

 I did not like the available colors of the Fusion, the lack of personality, the Interior with  very  limited rear and side view, the dash board  displays some of them hardly legible because of glass reflections and diverting attention from driving, too much electronics, the keyless starting, no mechanical emergency brake etc.  I could kick myself  for having felt intimidated to buy a  car I disliked and I do regret it every time I look at the car or drive it. But  I blame only myself and I have only praise for the dealer, who was very polite and  tried to do his best. 

The lesson: Do your homework before buying.

112,"August 10, 2019","Took my car in 3 times for the same problem within a very short time frame. Told them cracking sounds form by front passenger side when steering wheel turns either direction. Car was there for 2 days and only contact is if I initiate a call.

Advisor stated might be axle or the “boot.”  They replaced it. Sounds reappeared and made another appointment. Car was there for 2 days again. No contact unless I keep calling. They said nothing is heard and to drive around with the service staff.

Picked up car and sure enough sound was still there. I dropped it off and another advisor, Kevin confirmed within 4 seconds the problem. My advisor, Eddie, said I kept stating it was the axle. I told that is not what the case, I said when wheel turns, sound forms. As an advisor, he “advised” it could be the axle or boot, etc.

I waited at the dealership for nearly 3 hours on the 3rd visit, and when I haven’t heard any update, I again initiate contact. Eddie said they JUST started to look at it as they went to lunch! I told him what about my time?! I am not here to hangout and spend HOURS waiting, let alone 3rd time here! I requested a rental and he said I am paying for it.

I spoke to Manny and he said he will cover the rental when I told him briefly the situation.

I am no longer coming to this dealership as the service is beyond unacceptable. I do not tolerate to have my time wasted and having an advisor claim I said a specific phrase when 100% not the case, then say I am paying for a rental! To this day, there is still no contact and I have to call AGAIN for an update!

I had a prior experience where I had to bring the car back in for poor quality work where I told them my bulb was out and they replaced it. They didn’t bother to test it and I said it’s still out, check wires???

They confirmed the wires were somehow loose/messed up and replaced. I spoke to Manny about this a long ago about why don’t they do their job 100%, instead of 50%???

I asked for regular service because I was going for a road trip and I didn't realize that my Mileage was already 39.8K very near to 40K of I suppose for a special service?, he didn't even remind me or state any concern? I am not sure even if I should have concern or not? Secondly it was clearly written full service including Car wash and interior vacuum, but when I picked up my car there was no touch on exterior or interior cleaning? He didn't even offer me ride when I left my car for service? And finally my Bill didn't have any Inspection card attached to show what was the result of multipurpose inspection of my car, even though it was written there should be one.

136,"August 02, 2019","my experience with star ford was an absolute nightmare. i had my car towed to them on a thursday. i dealt with service specialist Sam. she was nice on the phone initially and told me she would follow up with me the next day. i received no call from her the next day but i did receive an automated text saying i could contact that number if i had any questions. i texted the following day to check on the status of my car but no response. i called sam the following day on friday to see what the status was and she was unable to tell me any sort of eta, just that my car had not been looked at. i called on monday after again to follow up and they still had not even looked st my car and could not give me even a foreseeable date in the future that they would look at it. tuesday morning i called to let them know i would be towing it off of their lot since it had been there for four work days without any progress or updates on the end of the staff at star ford. of course, once i mentioned that, she then had the car looked at. she told us that she could not do a diagnostic until the battery was replaced which she wanted to charge $180 for. please note that the car battery was dead because the anti theft device had been enabled and because there car sat there from thursday to tuesday with no one looking at it, the battery died. i told her i did not want them to change the battery so i would be getting the car towed off the lot. i called her back to coordinate the tow and she did not take my call or call me back, she then went home for the day. when my tow truck arrived, they would not release my car because sam told the cashier we owed $115 for the diagnostic. however on the phone she told me she was not even able to do the diagnostic because the battery was not working. they turned my tow truck driver away and the cashier called me to ask for payment. i told her i did not owe any payment, nothing was agreed upon or signed and that i needed to talk to sam. she kept repeating over and over “i don’t know mam, i am just a cashier, i just need to take your payment”. i asked for her manager and she said he was gone and no one could get a hold of him. she and multiple other people on site continued to argue with me and refused to release my car. they said they were trying to contact sam or the manager of the dealership, manny, but no one was able to reach them. i told them i was going to come down with my title and the police to have my car released and then all of a sudden they said they had the approval from sam to release my car. this was the biggest nightmare of my life and was a waste of 5 days waiting on my car to be repaired or even looked at. i had it towed to a locally owned garage and they looked at it same day - come to find that they were able to charge the battery and it worked again. they suggested we get a new battery but i was able to drive off the lot same day. i will never return to star ford and i will be sure to tell everyone i know about the absolute headache of an experience i dealt with there. even if i didn’t feel that they were trying to swindle me with repair work i didn’t reall need done or a battery that didn’t need replacing - the worst part still would have been sam and the way she dealt with my situation. she never returned my calls and deliberately passed my account on to someone else so she didn’t have to deal with me. i’m also very disappointed that the manager never got involved or contacted me after the fact.

153,"July 31, 2019","I am truly on the fence with Star Ford. I bought the maintenance plan with my lease so I have come here for service I think 4 times. Each time it’s had gotten a little better but I always make an appointment and then wait for at least a 1/2 hour after my appointment to be seen. No one says “we will be right with you” or really acknowledges you until it’s your turn. Maybe they are just swamped and don’t have the time. Once it’s my turn the staff is always nice to me and seem very knowledgeable. When I was sold the car they told me that they wash the car every time you get a service, but that is not true. They also told me that my maintenance plan was for the entirety of my lease but that was not true either. I never have to pay (or so I thought) so when they told me my car was ready, I got in and drove off. About 1hr later I got 2 voicemails telling me I had an outstanding balance and to call back to pay it.  I called back and they told me that my plan had been canceled as of May. I asked to speak to a manager and they sent me to the finance person. I left a message and did not hear back from him, but I got al least 3-5 more calls from different ppl asking me to pay the balance. Each time I told them I was waiting to talk with the finance person and they would send me over, and I got his voicemail. The last person I talked to told me the finance person had left and I would hear from him on Monday (this was a Saturday). On Monday I received a call in the afternoon from someone (not the finance person) asking me how I was going to pay for my outstanding balance. I again told him I was waiting to hear back from finance and he transferred me and I left another voicemail. He did call me back (Mr Camacho); he listened to me and was very apologetic and understanding but said I needed to talk with the service manager. He said he would call me within the hour. Never heard from him.  The next day the service manager called me (Manny) and asked me how I was going to pay for my outstanding balance. I almost lost my mind!  I literally talked to 7 people at that place and it just seems to me that no one is communicating at this place. He told me that my plan expired and apologized. I was so frustrated at this point that I was rude and mean and seriously lost it (I’ll admit that I am ashamed for unleashing on him). He told me he would pay for it and I said thank you and hung up. Once I calmed down I did call back and left a message apologizing for my behavior and thanked him again for clearing the charge. I think this place is getting better and it seems there are some new people (or new from 3yrs ago when I leased the car). I am willing to give this place another shot and will probably lease again from the in a few months when my lease is up. I think they are trying and they are nice, just need to get it together in the communication department.",4.4

Initially I was given a wait time of about 2 1/2 hours for my car. I chose to leave the car. Three hours later, I called in for an update since I hadn't heard from my advisor. He told me he had no update yet. At 4 pm (seven hours after I dropped off my car) he called to update me on the problem and to let me know the part would have to be ordered for the next day, and to give me the estimated cost. I approved the installation and had no choice but to leave the car overnight. The next day I did not hear from my advisor at all, so I called in around 3 pm for an update. He told me the car should be ready between 4 and 5 pm. My only issue/complaint is that communication from the service department should be more proactive. Other than that, I highly recommend this dealer.",4.4

The following is the letter I write.  I get the feeling that no one will every get back to me, so I might as well copy and paste it here:
										July 14, 2019
Dear Mr. _____

I am writing to tell you about my disappointment with the service I recently received at Star Ford Lincoln.    
 
For the past 4 years I feel I have been a very good customer of your company.  I bought my last two cars from your dealership.  All car servicing, with the exception of buying new tires has always been handled there.  In the past, I have been extremely happy and grateful with the service I have received.

This was not the case last week.  Previously, in May of this year, I brought in my car because of problems with Bluetooth.  I believe Donovan helped me.  At the time, he informed me that Ford would have to order a part for the Bluetooth.  I picked up my car and a week or two later, as promised, I received a call from Donovan telling me the part had arrived.

About two weeks later I brought in my car, on a Saturday, with other problems—a broken belt and a catalytic converter that needed to be replaced.   Donovan was not there at the time, but Kevin graciously backtracked on the account and helped me get going on all the work.  That day, the car was checked out, and Kevin called me to tell me that the work would have to begin on Monday, as I had brought the car in late on a Saturday afternoon.  On Monday, I didn’t get a call from Kevin, so I called at the end of the day and was told by him that they were just waiting on a part for the Bluetooth.

On Tuesday I did not get a call, so I called the repair department.   During these phone calls, I was put on automatic hold and agent holds for long stretches.  Finally, a person on the phone told me, after almost a ten-minute wait, that Kevin is not in, but she was transferring me to Michael.  Michael was very nice and gave me an update, telling me the car still wasn’t ready, but Kevin would contact me the following day and give me the most up to date information.   On Wednesday and Thursday, I did not receive any calls on the status of my car.  After more long holds, only to be told to try Kevin at another time as things were really busy, on Thursday afternoon I finally drove down to the dealership to find out what was going on and get something out of my car.

Kevin was there. He told me they were still waiting on a part for the Bluetooth.  He was very nice.  I told him that I was frustrated that it’s so hard to get through on the phone and no one returns my calls.  He apologized, saying that he had been out with a leg injury.  I said, “All I ask is that you please keep me updated daily.  Not having my car is a big inconvenience in my life.” He told me he would, of course, keep me updated.

I did not hear from Kevin on Friday.  On Saturday morning, I tried repeatedly to get through on the phone to service, only to be put on hold after hold and sometimes my call was dropped. Finally, I was able to get a message through to Kevin asking him to call me back as soon as possible.  After an hour and a half of not hearing from him, on my final phone call, I pressed 0  on the main line to speak with an operator.   An actual person answered immediately.  I told
this person that I wanted to leave a message with Kevin that I am frustrated with my service at Star Ford Glendale and I would be picking up my car as soon as possible.  She asked me if I wanted to be transferred over to Kevin, and I said, “I’m done with phone transfers that leave me on interminable holds.”

Ten minutes later I got a call from Kevin, saying that they are still working on finding a part for the Bluetooth and problems reaching my insurance company, but the work should be done soon.  I told Kevin, “I’m frustrated with the service I received. I just want my car back.”

An hour later, I paid for the work done and drove away disappointed and drove away feeling like I was not valued as a customer at your business.  I don’t know where to go from here, in terms of where I will go next time I need car and/or service.  At this point, what would help as new start would be for the $187 I paid for the belt to be discounted.

Sincerely,
____

183,"July 17, 2019",My last visit was much worse than this time with diff service rep. The last time I was left waiting for hours when job was completed and charged much more than other visits . Also had an incident with my drivers side door getting pushed down so when I open door it hits the body of vehicle . I called the dealership back but was told it wasn’t their fault . Now I was told I can go to ford body shop for repair but I shouldn’t have to pay for repair since it was done under their care when getting serviced . ,4.0

188,"July 15, 2019","I have been to this center three times in 2 weeks. The first was just a check up, so they should have probably caught that the left blinker wasn't working. I mentioned it when I dropped off the car. So I had to go back and get that fixed, and they told me it would take half an hour to fix. It took three times that long. Two days later my right blinker broke, so I made an appointment at 12:30 on Saturday. They didn't see me until almost 2, and then called 10 minutes before they closed to say that it was ready. I couldn't get there on time and they were closed Sundays, so I had to get it on a Monday morning before work. 

I don't blame the service reps at all, but I shouldn't have to go three times in 2 weeks to deal basic maintenance issues, and it would have been nice if my appointment could have been honored.",2.8

203,"July 01, 2019",Came in with a scheduled appointment for a maintenance car service. When a service rep came to help. He took my info then said that my service rep would come in shortly. Shortly was like 8-10min. Who then came ans asked for all my info again. Went on my merry way to wait in the lounge. He said estimated time two hours because of a recall. After two hours I havnt heard anything and so I preceded to text him and ask how much longer? 30 min later finally replied it was finished. When I went to get my car He gave me the receipt but no report. Most service reps talk about your report and keep you up dated if something needs attention. I assumed that because he had nothing to say my car is good. then showed me to the cashier and left. Didn’t even hand me my keys or anything on where my car was.  I got an email later with the report and it had marked that I needed some immediate attention for brake and transmission fluid. Why didn’t he talk to me about that or why they gave my car that mark? Everyone was nice and courteous but service fell very short ,3.0
204,"July 01, 2019","I had to take my car in to get the passenger airbag replaced because of a recall. I got my recall notice about a year ago informing me that my car was unsafe to drive and that the airbag may cause death or injury. I immediately called Star Lincoln Ford and they informed me that they did not have the airbags in stock and that it would take a long time for them to get them in stock. So I waited and waited. Finally, a few weeks ago, I was able to make an appointment. My service consultant was very nice to deal with. However, when I picked up my car, the onboard Sync system no longer worked. I had to go back to the dealership and the tech had to take the car to the back to fix the Sync system. I was very busy that day and it was stressful to wait for 30 minutes longer than I expected. Also, my car has automatic lights and I usually don’t worry about making sure my lights are off when I turn off my engine. For some reason, my lights had been switched into the parking light mode and I did not notice when I got out of the car (there was daylight still). The next morning my battery was dead and I was late to work since I had to spend time finding a neighbor to jump start my car. Overall, this experience took way too much of my time for something that was Ford’s fault in the first place. I won’t be buying a Ford again!!",3.0

Seta had great customer service and literally hustled every step of the process to make it very efficient for me. I prefer to perform most of my own maintenance and dropping off the car for service is generally a poor experience for me; this was not the case at Star with Seta helping me out. I received an accurate quote, has access to talk with the mechanic, received timely updates via text and a prompt turn around once the work was complete. The complimentary LIFT to the office when I dropped off helped to make the entire process as stress free as possible. The dealership is very clean, well run and ultimately a pleasure to deal with. Thank you for getting me taken care of so quickly... ",4.6
213,"June 27, 2019","Hi, I have regularly come to you guys over the past year and have had a generally positive experience with your team. Last oil change I was told by your customer service representative that I would be to have my brake fluids changed within the next service or so. He quoted me around $300 and I told him I would most likely do it the next time I came in. This time I came in and the cs rep mentioned nothing about the brake fluids needing changing but then gave me a list of over $800 worth of services she recommended. When I got my car report it said that my brake fluids were completely green-- it wasn't even yellow like the report said last time I came in. This is contradictory information and as a customer I don't know if I can trust your business. I called yesterday to speak with a manager because I would like to understand what happened and why your recommendations  and the report are not consistent.  I was put on hold for 10 minutes and then asked for my name and number to be called back. I have not been called back yet.  I will not return to your business until someone calls me back. ",2.4

It was 2pm and I had not heard back yet so I decided to call to get an update. I was then informed that the vehicle had been ready. Excuse me, so why did I get a call to inform me of that my vehicle was ready. I didn’t say anything and just picked up my vehicle. The next day (June 21), I hear the break still squeaking. I called and was told that Kevin from the service department was on the line and would I get a call back. I called two hours later after I didn’t get a call back and spoke to Giselle from the service department and she informed Kevin is yet again on the phone. I explained the situation to her and she asked me to bring the car in again, mind you I had to get a day off to bring in the vehicle. at this point, I am frustrated because I asked for the day off work had to pay for two Lyfts and the car was not fixed which was the reason I brought it in the first place. Instead of assisting me, she was completely rude and hung up on me. I have been a customer at STAR Ford because of their great service from great former employee Donavin Etu, who unfortunately is not there.

Next day afternoon Eddie text me that the part was a wrong part ordered and we have to wait until the new part arrives and we don't know exactly how long.  So I said I will have my father pick up the car and you can let me know when the part is ready for me to bring in the car.

Wednesday my father and Brother go in to take the car. Eddie was rude to my brother and not answering him why or how long for the part to come. He avoids my brother and calls the sales man who sold the car, his name is Nardos (Nick). He was extremely rude to my family to a point where my brother told him back the F... up and they left.

Very terrible customer service on both service agent and the sales agent. I still don't know from Eddie the service department about the part.

253,"June 01, 2019","My car has had so many recalls I can’t count and when I go to get them fixed, I’m usually treated poorly and made to wait a very long time before I’m even acknowledged. Randy told me to smile, called me little lady, told me I’d “get a lot further if I was nice” because I wasn’t smiling after waiting to be greeted for 45 min. I was never rude or inappropriate, I simply wasn’t smiling. He treated me in a manner that I know he wouldn’t have treated a man. He also put me on speaker phone with a technician who said he should have charged me for 10 extra hours of labor and said he wasn’t going to fix the problem, unaware that I was on the line. Then after they had my car for 4 days, I picked it up and it broke down again, for the same reason. Which is to say the technician pretended to fix my car and sent me back out onto the streets with a dangerous and faulty transmission. Manny remedied the situation and the services were covered under warranty, but I have honestly never had a worse experience. I am wildly disappointed with the unprofessional, inconsiderate way I was treated by the staff. The only cars I have ever bought have been Fords and I’m sorry to say you’ve lost a longtime customer.

281,"May 22, 2019","I always come to Star Ford when my car needs service.  I love the service center and my service advocate Danielle ""Sam"".  She always treats me well and had a quick check-in and headed to the waiting room to hang out while my car was being serviced.  This is usually a good quiet time to catch up on my reading and e-mails, however this experience came with a predatory salesman named John.  He was like a pollinator, jumping from one service customer to another asking about their vehicle, what it's in for, how much they owe on it, etc.

I was never more uncomfortable and annoyed in a service department.  This captive-audience predatory practice is not appropriate at all.  Not only did it propagate an uneasy feeling among those in the room, it also publicly revealed private information of the ""prey"" as they divulged financial information, residential information, to John as he continued to ask increasingly personal questions.

I would recommend that someone speak to the sales staff and remind them that folks in the waiting room are not focused on buying cars, they are focused on maintaining the vehicles they already have and to put their faith in the fact that if someone is looking for a purchasing option, they will seek out help.  We are not helpless.

Other than that, I had a very positive experience,

308,"May 08, 2019","First of all I did not buy my car from a ford dealership therefore if I would have just gone there to have my car serviced. 
I received a postcard for a recall ford was having and it said call an 800 number which I did and the guy that answered was amazing. He took care of everything, found the location, made the appointment and even got me a rental for the inconvenience. My schedule changed so I needed to change the appointment for a sooner date. I called and was told that they don’t offer rentals and that what they did provide was a one way Lyft voucher, I then mentioned that I had received a postcard with a rental offer and she said ok when you come in prove it. Then I asked how long it would be she said it would be around half a day. I said ok, thank you. I then call the 800 number and fortunately spoke to the same person that I had spoken to before and he called the dealership spoke to them and assured me not to worry everything is set up. I finally show up to my appointment and as soon as I let the service technician know I’m getting a rental he looks at me with disdain and was appalled then proceeds to tell me that I don’t need a rental and they don’t give out rentals for this type of Service. I then let him know about my earlier conversation with the receptionist and he says she was in the wrong, so I say ok, well that’s not my problem she’s giving out wrong information. Finally he says since I have a case open they approved my rental. The voucher was for $25! You would think that after all that grievance it was going to be for hundreds of dollars! But anyway, I got the rental, and it took me a little  over an hour to drive home. It was probably 2.5/3 hours later when the sales guy is calling that my  car was  ready ... I said sure thank you I’ll be there tomorrow as planned. I seriously do not understand why there was a need to contact me. Then when I show up the next day the service technician could not give me the time or day, he was on the phone, did not Look up at me just had some papers out motioned for me to sign and gave me a piece of paper and said your car will be outside whilst never putting the phone down. I was beside myself. I really don’t understand if ford corporation was being so accommodating why this dealership was the complete opposite.

I was greeted by Randy, with a smiling face and he was so very helpful!!! I was reassured that everything was fine, and they were able to get me in and out in under 2 hours, after a super stressful morning, and i was starving and in a bad mood, so this totally brightened my day immediately.
     Secondly, I should remark, I thought that I was due for a 50K maintenance, well shockingly, they could've just taken advantage, but ""RANDY"" took the time to really show me the screen with all of my information, really broke it down for me about age of car verses mileage and sometimes it goes by miles, sometimes it goes by age, he really spent the extra 3-5 mins to explain to me that I didn't need the extra maintenance this week, but because I drive A LOT! I should come next month.
     ""MANNY"" the service manager was walking by, came over and said hello, asked me if there was anything more the service team could do for me, and it was the most superior treatment compared to the mechanic shop I have been to 100 times with my last vehicle. He walked me to the waiting area where there was a coffee machine and I was able to plug in at the counter area and get some work done, it was great, seriously all great. 
     I can highly recommend customer service gentleman Randy, and if you run into Any problems, ask to speak to Manny, the sales manager, he really helped me out when I first bought my used car there with a warranty, he was more than fair, and they really took exceptional care of my vehicle and actually ""cared"" about me as a client.

They were unable to find out what was causing the seats to fold up on their own.  No error codes showed up so at this point we just wait of it to happen again then bring it back in.  The service was pretty good and this dealership tends to be much better than the North Hollywood dealership.  The only thing I would have liked is more communication through out the process.

349,"April 25, 2019","I considered my experience poor for the following reasons: I received a recall letter in December 2018 letting me know that I needed to take my Ford Focus for Safety Recall service. The letter indicated that I would receive a notification when the parts arrived, so I could make an appointment. The first quarter came and went, and I never received a notification. When I called the service department, I learned that they had the parts. The service representative was not friendly and in a short and dismissive tone, told me that, ""Ford does not offer service for safety recall cars on Fridays."" I was stunned when I heard this! Fixing safety recall cars should be a priority at Ford: these defective cars can potentially cause an accident, as your letter clearly states, and endanger my safety and others.  
Then, when I took my car for service, Ford didn't want to pay for the Lyft driver because my work is over 10 miles from the dealership--my work is only 12 miles away from Glendale. In my opinion, this must be part of the ""free of charge service."" 

Finally, when I went to pick up the car, the cashier who called to get the car from the service department, was unfriendly and not even made eye contact with me once. She made me feel as if I had done something wrong for taking my car to fix the defect.

I always praised Ford not only for its quality of cars but excellent service. Now, I have nothing good to say: Since I bought the Ford Focus, I have taken it 3 times for service all related to the defect engine and CPV. And all three times, the service has been mediocre. I definitely, won't buy nor recommend to friends and family to buy a Ford.

Why wouldn't that have been done. I also had to buy brand new windshield wipers only 3 weeks after purchase. Also a brand new battery. These are things that should have been checked and replaced if needed BEFORE the sale. So I feel that they are not checking their cars thoroughly.

I can’t drive my car anymore not even to the grocery store, it’s dangerous. This issue has led to a National Lawsuit against Ford. I took my car for a diagnose again since they were not able to repair the shuddering transmission and long delay acceleration last time I took it, and for me to qualify for the settlement of the lawsuit I needed another diagnose. They had zero understanding, they just wanted to get rid of me and told me that now they had a new error code on the throttle body. And until I would not fix the throttle body ($1,200!!!!) they could not diagnose the transmission. For the record, the throttle body is a small part that costs $37 and a normal mechanic can replace in literally 15 min for $20.

When the windshield wiper fluid dispenser on my 2008 Ford Focus stopped functioning, I made an appointment at this service center. Sam Davis ""helped"" me, and she was rude from start to finish. She could't figure out what was wrong by looking under the hood, so she asked me to follow her inside. Then she asked if I was up-to-date on my routine maintenance. Well, she had my file up in front of her -- couldn't she see that I was just there for an oil change? Then, she printed off a quote and gave me a pen to sign off on it, without talking me through anything whatsoever. When I saw that the estimate was $145, I asked her what that would cover, and she said a diagnostic. (Treating me as if I were an idiot for asking such a stupid question.) She also told me that it would take ""at least a couple of hours"" and that this type of work is not done on the weekends. (For the record, I've had this issue before, and it was resolved quickly for a low cost.) Well, I work full-time during the week, and I needed to get back to work, so I told her I was leaving. When I returned to my car, I couldn't find my keys, so I went back in to ask her where they were. She told me that she'd left them on the windshield, but they weren't there. Someone else found them inside my car. Again, from start to finish, a negative experience. She was not friendly or helpful or considerate or accommodating. You've just lost a loyal customer. ",1.0

I had my car in less than a year ago for the recall on the transmission so was confused as to why my car would behave that way. I took my car in on a Friday afternoon, and was told there was yet another recall on my fuel tank that would get looked at first,  for peace of mind I just left it there and waited on a text or phone call update Saturday. I didnt hear anything Friday night or Saturday morning, I go back to work on Sunday so I needed a vehicle,  and texted the number that was given to me for text updates. I received nothing for 2 hours, so I called and was told they were still looking at my fuel tank without even addressing the issue I brought the car in for. After renting a car, I checked back in on Monday because  no one  has been updating me, and my service advisor was not available, and talked to someone else. He said it will be 2050 dollars for a new clutch and front brakes. I have an extended warranty on the car and got the entire transmission replaced less than a year ago , yet he assured me that had nothing to do with my clutch on an automatic transmission. When I went to pick up my car 5 days later,  no one greeted me,  there was one advisor helping someone and a bunch of other people except my service advisor. I didnt know where to go or who to talk to. I went to the cashier, and she said I have to pay before getting my car, understandable but I wanted to speak to someone about what went on, why I'm paying 2 grand, and the whole shebang.  Because my service advisor wasnt there, she couldnt do that, and no other representative could help me. I was very confused but felt I needed to bail my car out of jail.

Driving away, my car was still hesitating,  not shifting, but for 2 thousand dollars I was expecting a smooth ride.",2.8

443,"March 26, 2019","**I had sent an email on 3/22/19 to Manny Arguello but I have yet to hear back from him.


My name is Aremy Gomez. I went in for a schedule appointment to address issues with my A/C on 3/20/19. I was assisted by Michael Harry. Mike told me the service should only be a few hours. Around 4:30 pm that day, he texted me that they were still running the diagnostic and asked if the car could be kept overnight. I noticed the text around 5 PM and responded that was not acceptable since I drive for work. No response, 

I had to stop in the middle of a session with a client in order to contact Ford and inquire what was going on with my car. The woman informed me that Mike had already left for the day! I told the woman who assisted me that I was at a loss having been left with no car and no KEY to my apartment (same keychain) and asked for a rental. However, she told me that anyone who could authorize a rental was also gone for the day.  This was completely unacceptable and hurtful. I understand that I am not the only customer but this was incredibly inconsiderate. I felt so disregarded. I did not confirm that the car could stay over night and was not even given the opportunity or courtesy of a phone call to arrange for a car/rental to get home. The next morning, I had to CANCEL a session with a high-risk client due to having no transportation and needing to go into Ford to get a rental. Upon arrival, Mike did not apologize for his lack of customer service and appeared unfazed when I did bring up feeling upset about being left with no car and no apartment key. In addition, I was provided with a rental that was on empty which further prolonged me from starting my word day.

Ultimately, I just wanted to make to issue known to prevent this type of issue to occur in the future.",3.0

450,"March 23, 2019","This dealership masquerades as a legitimate operation. Be careful. Surprised that Ford would allow them to use their logo and brand.

I'm sure for basic service they're fine. When it comes to system updates or anything ford warranty related - they simply don't know what they're doing or have hacks to get around the system.

When this happened to me they held my truck and I had to fight to get it back in working order. The switched my person several times in the name of convenience, but the reality is they do this to change the story on you so that there isn't any accountability on what the previous person promised or said.

I was told it would be a simple update. No more than a couple of hours. Day one I was told it was the wifi, then i was told it was Ford, then I was told it was my truck. I couldn't afford to leave it with them as it's my main means of transport or income. So they made me wait two more hours to get it ready and updated. A week later I bring it and told the part is in stock and it should take no more than an hour. 8  hours later I'm told it's the wifi, then that it's Ford, and that I have to leave my vehicle.

Understand by this point I've dealt with 3+ people all whom know little to nothing of what the previous person said, promised, or advised. So each time you have to start all over again. They text you and don't reply. They don't engage in solutions only presenting and making it your problem. Frankly some of the people are just rude and think it's perfectly ok to leave you w/o a vehicle and to waste your day.

They take no responsibility and make all problems someone else's -- ford, the wifi, the system, and your vehicle. What a bunch of charlatans. My truck is still broken.",1.0

495,"March 04, 2019","I wasn't planning on writing this review but as I keep finding issues related to my car being serviced at Star Ford last summer I feel I should let others be aware as it continues to infuriate me. In July 2018 I took my 2018 Shelby GT350 with 7k miles in to have the engine replaced, it had a mechanical failure which apparently isn't an uncommon thing with these vehicles. It took nearly 3 weeks for Star Ford to even get around to inspecting the car and having Ford approve a new engine via warranty, I had to call in regularly to see what was happening as their level of contact was rather minimal.

After 6 weeks of the car being down I go to pick it up. This is what I find:

1) A nick in the driver door handle.
2) A nick in the dashboard.
3) A scrape on the rear bumper.
4) The interior was absolutely FILTHY with trash in it from working on the car and a layer of dust from presumably having the windows down for weeks at a time.
5) The driver side wiper was mis-adjusted too high and missing the cap on the nut.

Needless to say for a premier car by Ford I was thoroughly disappointed.

Now over time I have noticed other issues related to their work such as:

1) Damaged washer fluid hose from removing the hood.
2) Improper clips over the battery cover.
3) Steering wheel came loose while driving! For some reason they had to replace the clock spring behind the steering wheel when the car was in their hands, they obviously didn't properly tighten down the steering wheel nut. This is a serious one and could've resulted in an accident.

Frankly I am surprised the engine is even bolted in correctly at this point (maybe it isn't), needless to say I would avoid their service department at all costs. Maybe their sales team is fine but this would be the worst experience I've ever had with a dealer in regards to service.",1.4

Our sales person was Mark and have to say he made the whole process transparent, fair and easy vs. the hassle, haggle, headache we got elsewhere. Save your self some time go to Star Ford and ask for Mark he was so awesome even calling us the next day to make sure we were loving our new car. Highly recommend this dealer.",5.0

500,"March 03, 2019","On Feb. 25, I arrived at Starr Lincoln service center at 7 am... I stated that the charging ports in the console area used to charge phones was not working (not charging) and perhaps it might be a blown fuse.. they said they would check them.. Seta, the service writer, recommended that I could have a cup of coffee across the street while I wait... 10 minutes later I received a text stating that 2 fuses were blown.: I replied that I would be there in just a few minutes and that I would need them replaced.. I returned to service area and waited for 3 more hours til 10:30..
They finally brought my car and I was led to Parts Dept. to what I thought was pay for the 2 fuses that I know cost no more than $4 or $5 dollars.. to my surprise the total bill was $147... I was never told that it would cost that much.. I know it took only about 2 minutes to change those 2 fuses.., which are right on top of motor.. I told Seta that I could have done that myself in no more than 5 minutes.. She replied that “well, it’s already done!!”.. I went to the service center with a great deal of confidence in the workers.. I just went thru a severe heart operation and walked in there with a false sense of trust that I could get help with such trivial a matter.. it was 3 1/2 hours to change 2 small fuses which takes not even 5 minutes.
I understand the deductible part.. but even then, I was never made aware of what it would cost... I guess I was expecting friendly courtesy in making me aware that my suspicions were right and that I could just change the fuses myself.. Sooooooo disappointed..
I would hate to think that you are the type of establishment that would want me to install a new transmission when all it needed was a quart of oil..
3 1/2 hours to change those 2 little fuses .
$147 for 2 little $4 fuses.,.. and to top it all off.. the charging system still doesn’t work..!!!!!!!
It probably was never tested..!
Now you tell me, please, .!. am I making a big deal out of nothing????

Araya gave us the answers we needed, and information on how to work with Star Ford - removing every barrier to a sale with the dealership. He knew what we wanted and delivered exactly.

Onsite, the sales process when buying, was flawless. Araya ran the different financing options, explained everything, took care of us while our used car was being appraised, took care to provide the info we needed about the new car, and did the final handoff perfectly. He went above and beyond by personally getting the car onto the lot from a different dealership. He took the time to send us home with a full tank.

When I brought up the TSB concern the service advisor said she couldn't find a TSB issued for my vehicle.  The service advisor then brought out a technician who said ""it's not bad"" and proceeded to blow off my concern.  I even heard them discussing how I found this on the internet and it's not relevant.  

The oil change was fine, and completed within the time I was told.  The additional service concern was absolutely horrible.

I'm not your average car guy.  I have a low production high performance car with low miles.  I baby this vehicle and I keep up on TSBs issued by Ford.

The service adviser was friendly and listened to what I had to say. When the service was done and I had questions, the adviser went into techno speak that did not make any sense to my questions. 

When my car showed they immediately popped the hood (not usual) and did a battery test. Nothing had been mentioned about the battery. When I picked up the car I was told that my 1 year old battery needed to be replaced, and that it was the problem with the rough idle and shifting.

I asked why a 1 year old battery would need to be replace and didn't get a satisfactory answer. 

Rather than waste time waiting for an answer, I went home and searched for it on the internet. Why is it so hard to tell the customer the truth that there is a problem with phantom power drain on this vehicle? I guess it is not a problem if I get a new battery every year.",3.5

651,"January 12, 2019","This was my first experience with this dealership. Kevin McGlinchey was my service agent - he was down-to-earth, kind and communicative. I appreciated the warmth of the office, and playfulness between the agents. I had some things fixed while in for 2 recalls on my Lincoln. The repairs were more expensive than originally expected, and some confusion in how much time it would take - but overall, I'm happy to get things done. 

I wasn't happy about the scary recall - I had checked the vin# 1.5 years ago for a passenger airbag that releases shrapnel, and was informed that my lot wasn't included. And checking again after all this time, finding out I was in a dangerous car that has injured and killed many others was unsettling. Manny was the first person I talked with over the phone, and he kept his word and called back when he said, and was able to allow 48 hours of car rental once the part was in. I didn't like having no option for a rental car during the wait time, once I've learned I'm driving in a dangerous car. This was the main concern for me  - - and I'm not sure who is accountable for those decisions. You would think that the liability issues along with concern for the wellbeing of the drivers would be a priority to keep the reputation of the Lincoln and Ford name. I know the faulty airbag was sold to many car companies - - However, we are a Ford/Lincoln family due to their strong ethics and responsibility for handling their situations with care. It felt like this recall was not done with care. There was misinformation and a lack of providing options for those owners who are driving unsafe cars. And again - I'm overall happy with the experience due to the kind genuineness and  humanity of Kevin and those around that helped me. And the decisions made appeared to be the limit set by the executives, so it didn't seem to be their fault as they were following protocol.",4.4

People that showed up after me without an appointment were helped before I was (they said this was fleet service, but it was just a guy in a mustang).  I was then told they may not be able to do the repair and only the service.  I was not happy.  I was asked if I could leave my car overnight, and I explained that I was on call the next day and could not, but to no avail.  Luckily I ended up not needing the repair.  Also they didn't clean the car.  Everywhere I have been, a cleaning is part of the basic service.

Basically, I spent 40 minutes waiting to just get in for my appointment and ended up with a very basic service.  Not sure why I can't show up and walk inside instead of standing by my car.  Very lame and poor service.  Some of us have things to do besides waiting for service.

660,"January 09, 2019","Selling absolutely quick. Think as you were dealing with scammer. After you signed the paper, you are done. No communication AT ALL after purchase. I bought car as promised, so I decided to buy it. Already over a month, and I still haven't receive replacement for my car because dealer said OEM is too expensive. So, I guess this dealer does not use OEM due to pricey on OEM. Imagine what they would put inside the engine, mechanical parts, aftermarket??? Of course, OEM is too expensive, so this dealer will try everything to get the cheapest, lowest cost possible. I know something is not right when signing the paper and wanted me to drive the car home because I am not in a hurry to buy a car, but I made a very very stupid decision. Now, I think I should better pay someone to inspect my car because OEM is too expensive from what the dealer told me. 

So, if anyone want to do one-time business, buy from Star Ford Lincoln. Otherwise, think twice before you buy from them. Like my co-worker said, ""You're screwed"". Yes, I am screw this time. I just hope nobody will fall into same trap I did. I even tried contact GM, left voice messages and email, never receive one call back from, NOTHING AT ALL.

672,"January 03, 2019","What I appreciated most is that, as it turned out, I was offered a Lyft not only home but back to the dealership. What made my choice of Star Ford for my car service #1 in years prior was not necessarily the high OEM pricing, it was the shuttle that allowed me, as a single individual to get my car serviced in a way that didn't make it a hassle for me. Since the policy has changed, offering me the ride to and from home was very appreciated. (Customer Service)

However, my report card showed ALL GREEN marks without specificity on my tires in particular. The report card in general made it look like my 145K vehicle was in the same shape as if I'd just had every service done. Now I've done a couple things but I now my tires will need replacing soon. Because the report card was done without specificity, I felt in the end that, ""wow! I hope they actually changed my oil!"" which was the additional service I needed aside from the air bag recall repair. It's been my experience in the past that although I just got an oil change, my fluids were not topped off and days after service I had no window washer fluid. I haven't yet checked my window washer fluid but just having the sense that it wasn't taken care of makes me wonder why all the 21 points are listed and charged for to the customer yet not necessarily addressed. I pay for detail, I need to receive detail on the status of all systems on my vehicle. Otherwise I would go somewhere for a $25 oil change. I need to monitor my vehicle, especially at this age - whether or not I choose to get a service that day or not.

It was a holiday and my guess is that no one wanted to be backed up in case a customer said, ""eh, can we do this today?"" 

I'd appreciate some follow-up on this. I've been a customer with this vehicle since I bought it in 2005.",4.0

I brink donuts or candy once or twice a year for the staff. Charlie was my favorite service rep before he retired. With this visit, I tried to make an appointment on line right after Thanksgiving, but the website wouldn't let me save the appointment. I arrived figuring it would just take longer, no big deal. I met a new service rep; the check in went well. It must have been my miscommunication or not listening correctly, but after that I was not as happy with the service as I usually am. Thinking I'm going in for ""The Works"" and brakes, I end up a $700 plus bill for my 2015 Flex and I'm stunned. In addition, I'm not even sure what the service rep is saying. I'm trying to explain it to my husband but I'm told it's going to be on the bill so we can review it (there ended up being one sentence). Four hours later I drive home not sure what just happened. The service rep doesn't review the bill with me. I pay and leave stunned. My husband calls service when I get home to ask for an explanation of the bill.   A week later I find out the windshield wiper fluid is empty. I fill it up. When I try and use it a week later, it still doesn't work. My husband trouble shoots and finds out the line to the sprays are disconnected. ",3.0

694,"December 25, 2018","The last thing you want to do during the Christmas holidays is spend more money than you absolutely have to. I visited several dealerships in different cities around the Los Angeles area and found many dealers just wanted my money. Although some were polite and professional, there was a lack of connection & trust. After all, it’s the holidays, that’s the least I can expect, right? I came to Ford and was instantly greeted by Moe Olympia. Within the first 5minutes he gave me a quick tour around the lot and showcased the many “pros” of several different vehicle models. I came to ford with an idea in mind (color, price, size, etc.). It wasn’t until Moe showed me the other lot where I fell in love with a SUV. Inside features is what sold me! We test drove it and Moe literally showed me all the features. He showed me automatic parallel parking feature, the on-screen navigation, trunk ability, sun roof features and so much more! After several discussions about pricing, that’s where I met Moe Khan. He was super knowledgeable and very trustworthy in explaining the breakdown of all my concerns. He made it very known that he was on my side—and that’s extremely rare to feel at any dealership! Both men spent hours getting the best deall for me, and during all of it, Both gentlemen had positive attitudes. They were funny! They held great conversation! And very trustworthy! After settling on a deal, they broke down more information and continued to build the excitement up for the new car I decided to go with. Overall, I am very pleased and happy to be a SUV owner! I enjoyed my experience here and actually learned so much about my car and others as well. It was a long process but with Moe delivering me food/drinks and holding up great customer service. It felt fast. I’m happy to have establish trust and bonds with both Moe’s & I’ll highly recommend this location specifically to anyone considering a car of purchase! Thank you again Ford, Glendale!

I ended up waiting for 30 mins and having to ask another service adviser to help me. After I paid the service bill, I went next to my car waiting for someone to hand me my key. After waiting for 10 minutes, I saw her walking out from the parking garage with a big togo drink in her hand. She proceeded to ask me why I was standing there when my car was ready.

Ford even told enterprise where I was renting a car a few days.  They gave me 3 days on the rental.  Thank goodness for open ended contract, but I was paying for it. 
It took them more like ""several"" days to just diagnose where and why my car's gasket  leaked water into my car and verify my back up camera worked intermittently. 4 business days to do just that!  I called for update.  Ford rep left message without any info other than to call them back.  Phone tag ensued where I requested for detailed messages.

I heard nothing from the advisors at 3pm. So I called to get a update and was informed it would need to be held overnight. This is what happened on the second visit and I informed them I can’t be a day without my vehicle as I use it for my work. They got me into a rental, but I was still responsible for insurance costs. 

I call the following day and my service advisor, Randy, is not in the office. This is his scheduled day off and he told me nothing of the sort. So the previously in the day as I was text messaging him through the system, I was not getting a response. That prompted the phone call, which I was informed it would need to be held overnight again. Finally at the very end of the third day, just an hour before service and Enterprise Rent A Car closed, I was told to come pick up my vehicle. 

No more than 24 hour after picking the vehicle up, the parking sensor issue is back and the infotainment is buggy. Bluetooth is constantly dropping and the screen freezes. 

I emailed Randy, no response. I called yesterday to speak to Manny or Randy, both were busy. I left a message for the manager to call me about my issues and I received no call back. It it now 2 days later and I’ve heard nothing.

737,"December 06, 2018","I normally go to Sunrise Ford’s service center bc that’s where I got my fusion leased. After three bad experiences, I hope that I would not get another car issue. Unfortunately, my battery died. Based on my previous experience I dreaded having to face their horrendous greeters and lack of order at the place, not to mention their people not looking you in the eye while they dodge questions. it was all I knew really about getting a car serviced. But I really really did not want to go back there so I just had to try another place.  Luckily the first one I tried was the shop in The Glendale Ford/Lincoln dealer. 

Before I get to the positives, I have to get this negative out of the way first. And even at this dealership, I was not acknowledged when I pulled up. There were about 6 or 7 people walking around all in clear view of my car pulling up. It was not busy, only one car ahead of me. Nobody gave me directions, or even looked at me, or said, “we’ll be right with you.” I just was just sitting there wondering what to do. One lady in her Late thirties to early forties was walking around with food in her hands, seemed like she was taking leisure at the mall.  If customers enter a restaurant, they are greeted immediately and shown to a table.  If someone enters my house, I’d offer them a seat on the couch. Basic courtesy is lacking here and at Sunrise Ford. 

After about 20 minutes, Kevin Mcglinchey, approached  and greeted me, then apologized for the wait. He seemed to be a more senior ranked person. I can’t believe that the senior ranked person had to come greet me himself. What were the other 7 people doing? It looked like they were just lounging around in their own back yard! 

The saving grace was Mr. Kevin Mcglinchey. His greeting warm and sincere in my eyes, qualities I see less and less nowadays. He listened attentively to my car battery issue. He said that it would be an easy and quick fix, and that I’ll be in and out in less than 2 hours, which was correct. further, he identified a recall issue and added that to the service as well. Now, i trust people, but it’s veery hard for others to earn it especially in the car business. There was a  question I had to ask Mcglinchey about something on the invoice that could have been confrontational. However, he handled with extreme grace and professionalism, and it turned out to be a layman’s (me) misunderstanding but makes perfect sense to people working in the business. He explained it to me perfectly in a short and concise way. Again, super professional and graceful. And really, this service made my day that day. My car batteries were fixed, I got a quick turnaround, and got great service (other than in the customer greetings department!). It’s really a stark contrast to Sunrise Ford, and I’ll likely be coming back to Kevin’s shop for future issues. Thank you Kevin, Keep up the great work! 

P.s. - the physical layout of the service place is also phenomenal looking organized and systematic (just work on those greeters and it’d woulda been a PERFECT experience for me!)",4.6
738,"December 04, 2018","When I drove in to the dealership back in November, I was greeted by Service Advisor, Randy Duckett. It was close to closing time. He asked how he can be of service.

He gave me an appt for the next morning even though they were all booked he was able to squeezed me in. Now tat I call Superior customer service.When I came back for the appt the next morning. Randy greeted me with a warm smile and took care of my car. He immediately arranged a ride back to get me to work. I was extremely pleased with Kelly Boettcher who discovered that my car battery was defective. Because of her I was able to get that changed. Cami Davis arranged the uber for me to and from work. She immediately took care of my need. Iliana was the one who made the service appt for me for the very next day. Manny Arguello greeted me with a very warm smile and took care of me when I drove in to the service dept. I also want to acknowledge the mechanic who worked on my car. All of the people I have mentioned are the best additions to the dealership. I was extremely pleased, happy with all the superior service everyone provided me.

744,"December 03, 2018","After having some work done to my 2008 Ford Focus I noticed that the Anti Theft (PATS) system had been triggered and wouldn't allow me to start my vehicle.  After doing some research I found out that the only way to have it reset was to take it into a Ford service center.  I called ahead to see if/when it could be serviced and was told by the service rep that it could be reset for $145 and that it would take approximately 2 hours to do it.  I told the service rep that I would bring it in the following morning since it was close to the end of business that day.  Once I brought it in I met with the service rep with whom I had previously spoken to over the phone and he brought out the service tech who would be servicing my vehicle.  I explained all the parts that had been recently replaced and that the PATS system needed to be reset, hence why I brought it into the dealership.  The tech said that we may need to have new keys cut and programmed and if so then it would run me $250, otherwise it would be $145 just to have the PATS system reset.  I was then told by the service rep that it would take a couple of days because of how ""busy they are"".  Having no other choice, I left the vehicle with them and waited for their phone call.  After a day I received a call from the service rep.  He told me that they were unable to turn off the PATS system because another part needed to be replaced (the ignition housing switch) and that it would cost $700 for the part and service.  I asked if they could turn off the PATS system without replacing the part and he told me no.  This didn't really make sense to me so I told him I would come by the following business day in order to speak with the service tech himself in order to see what could be done.  After arriving the next day the service rep brought me to the service tech and I further explained to the service tech that all I wanted was for the PATS system to be turned off and didn't want them to do all of the extra work of trying to figure out why else the car won't start.  After saying all of that the service tech then told me that he DID turn off the PATS system but that the car still wouldn't start unless we replace the ignition housing switch.  At this point I didn't know what to think.  First I was told that they could turn off the PATS system, then I was told there was no way to turn it off without replacing the ignition housing switch first, then I find out that they did in fact turn off the PATS system like I had originally asked.  The service rep then reminds me that it would be $700 for the part and service and by this point I was just ready to leave.  I told the service rep I would have the car towed to a mechanic that I know and have him replace the part.  The service rep then said it would be $195 for having the PATS system turned off.  We got into a little back and forth because he originally quoted me at $145 for that service and all of a sudden it shot up to $215 (""he factored in my AAA discount, thus bringing the total down to $195"").  After a while he agreed to the original quote of $145 and I had my car towed home.  It wasn't until I got home that I decided to actually see if the car would start, and to my surprise IT DID!  I didn't even have to go through the hassle of having it towed again, but because the service rep and tech told me it wouldn't start I believed them.  I'm giving this dealership 2 stars only because they reset my PATS system, but only after a few days of hassle.  I like to see the best in people, especially in the service industry, but I can't help but feel like these guys were trying to make some extra money off of services that I not only didn't ask for but ultimately didn't even need.",2.0

748,"December 02, 2018","I enjoyed Star Ford for a while because they are the only Ford dealership where you don’t have to set an appointment for an oil change 3 weeks in advance. But after we learned the dealership didn’t understand how to put the under tray back onto the car it was just disappointing. The undertray was scraping the ground for over a week until we realized. We noticed the valve cover was leaking a bit of oil and brought it to the service advisors attention. He said it was just sweating. Then we hit a small rock and took it to Ford. The undertray was pretty torn, battered, and saturated in oil. So the service advisor recommended we bought a $400 replacement. Even though they put it on wrong and was supposed to be saturated in oil. Our problems have yet to be resolved. ",2.6

Originally, I was told the truck wouldn't be ready until Monday or Tuesday but after hearing our predicament my service writer and the service manager worked together to expedite the repairs.

The first time I notice that the service rep did not explained services done on my truck so I was ok maybe next time, the second time I took my truck again I had to returned 3 times to rent a car due to the lock of customer service and the lock of correctly servicing my vehicle mechanically speaking as well. My truck was left on the roof of the parking structure with not only parts not working but windows open which causes for dust, tree lifts, etc. to go inside which I had taken to be detail days before, once truck finally given back after 2.5 weeks I had to speak with Manny (the manager) that promise me the heaven and the stars after I brought the issue to him that this will never happened again but guess what they just did it again today, pick up my truck as had to complaint to Angie, service department that other dealers have courtesy shuttle, she replied that they are only allow to use Lift but one way, unheard but finally she then send lift to pick me up this morning, got to the dealer with a positive attitude that this time my experience was going to be different meaning will be treat the right way... first after Angie at least took me to pay for service provided but never explained what was done nor at least a thank you, my truck was left outside under the climate, full of water due to the overnight weather, I had detailed it a week previous which frustrated me but thanks Lord Jesus contained myself then found inside the seat plastic cover laying on the passenger side along with the numerical tag on top of the dashboard so I said enough then I walked to Manny the manager to let me know that it was again an oversight ""again"". I conclude that this a pattern and that I should never go again since if this happened 3 times in a row that only tells me that Manny does not make his staff accountable
 sine the only question he asked me was "" what do you think I should do about it instead of telling me what he should do about it.

Just a brief summary-

Paul did not waste anytime giving me information on the suv I wanted. He knew I was shopping and he got straight to the point! Which I appreciated very much because buying car isn’t always easy. Besides him communicating with me, over the phone, e-mail and texts, the whole time he had a great personality!

I really like that Paul took his time to go over all the details of the Explorer, how to work the seats, navigating through the all the apps the vehicle has and even making sure I downloading the Ford app to show me how to use it. Which is very impressive! 

Again, Paul was great! And Freddy took his time to explain everything about our financing  terms and very pleasant to work with. I really thought he was going to push extra options on us but we’re the ones how picked an option once he throughly explained the benefits of each package. Great team work!

The same goes to purchasing a vehicle. I buy Ford because of the level of service that I get
and I buy at Star for that exact reason.",5.0

829,"October 31, 2018","I took my car in for an oil change and “the works” (checking tire pressure, fluids, etc). I was told the process would take 2 hours, but it took 3 hours, which I understand if they were having a busy day. When I was pinged that the service was done and I came back, the original service agent wasn’t around. I was standing around for a while before I flagged down another service agent, who realized the other person wasn’t around, got my paperwork, and helped me pay and get my car brought out. 
Before I left, I realized I should look through the paper work. It said that I had very little remaining in my rear break pads, plus other fluids that are very low and needs to be serviced. I went back in and asked the agent, and he explained these are things I should get fixed as soon as possible. So... why didn’t they tell me about these issues themselves before I asked? It seemed unresponsible and dangerous for them to not explain these car issues before I drove away, ESPECIALLY since the overall check up of the car was part of the Works, the point of the service I was there for. 

The oil change/the works price was reasonable, so i would go back to service my car, but not learning about vital information unless I ASK seems irresponsible and dangerous.",3.0
830,"October 30, 2018","Everyone one I dealt with was very professional, helpful, and personable. I did not feel rushed or pressured. They were all an absolute pleasure to deal with.  If I had one ""negative"" complaint, it would be that with the exception of doing the financial transaction, all deals are discussed and finalized in the open customer lounge with other customers who are purchasing cars or are having their cars serviced there. Apparently, this is common now at most dealerships? I'm just old fashioned and sort of liked the ""old days"" of being in a private office. Just my personal preference. But other than that, I would totally recommend this dealership because of the awesome personnel and service. ",4.8

832,"October 28, 2018","I spent $750 there recently after my check engine light came on.  The serviceman tole me that I needed to have a fuel injector replaced for approximately $750.  I approved this cost and then a few days later the check engine light was back on and my car quit running and I had to be towed to the Star dealership.  This time the serviceman told me that it was the coolant system and that I also had a gasket leaking for a total cost of $1500.  I had to approve it because my car stopped running.

So for a total of over $2500, my car is running.  I do feel like the first time that the engine light came on, Star Ford diagnosed my car incorrectly and I paid for a wrong fix.  I also didn't' need to have the gasket replaced because there was a very minimal oil leak but I felt that I had no choice.

This company made money on me and I feel that it was deliberately deceiving.

840,"October 25, 2018","The salesperson we worked with, Sasha, was pretty good.  However, I am not happy with my experience with the finance manager Freddie.  He was nice enough, but when going through the paperwork, he attempted to up-sell me some maintenance packages.  I know that these are usually a bad deal, but I wanted to confirm.  So I walked through the arithmetic with him on one of the options, and it seemed like one was a good deal, so I agreed to it.  On my way home, I went back over the math and realized that there was a mistake in the arithmetic and it was a really bad deal (paying $900 for $450 of value).  I called Freddie immediately, told him to cancel the package, and returned to the dealership to sign the corrected paperwork.  Freddie had told me earlier that transparency was very important to them. However, not correcting the math error when walking through the calculation with him was not exactly transparent.  Brush up on your arithmetic before you go in, triple-check your calculations, and don't buy any of the optional maintenance packages!  They would not sell them if they didn't make a ton of money.",2.3

852,"October 18, 2018","This is going to be a bad review to the extent that I have already traded in my fully loaded 2016 Lincoln MKZ Hybrid this past weekend on another luxury brand! While the MKZ Hybrid is a great car in itself Lincoln definitely has issues catering to their upscale customer experience that the other luxury brands do not. Unfortunately when it’s time for service for a Lincoln you have to take it to the Ford/Lincoln dealer where they aren’t capable of giving the kind of service and experience to a luxury car owner. This last trip to the dealer took them almost 3 1/2 weeks to get my car back to me for a variety of screw ups. The first time I brought the car in was for a broken seat so I got the oil changed at the same time and the next day they said come in your car is fixed. Of course they never touched the seat and had to bring out a tech who said he knew what part needed to be ordered which took another week to get and I had to bring the car back then. So now onto the 3/12 weeks of nonsense next, supposedly the part that came in the first time was not all they needed they had to order another part. Then a week goes by and that part came in broken I believe it was. Then they reordered another week goes by and supposedly they got the wrong part. In the meantime I get no calls from Seta their one and only Lincoln service advisor because apparently she is so busy to keep her clients informed on what is going on with their cars. Seriously I am expecting to get the car back maybe the next day after the parts come in and then days go by and nothing. I have to call or email to get status and of course we apologize for the inconvenience and I stay in their loaner car which is their only saving grace! So onto the last week when I call days after the part was supposed to be in she tells me the part they need is on backorder!! Wow so I ask her how long will it take to get it and Seta says parts dept has no idea, this was on a Wednesday and then only 2 days later I get the email my car is fixed. Wow I am shocked because only 2 days before the part was on backorder with no one having any ideas when the part was coming in..right! Personally I think they jury rigged the part because the seat still has a part on the side that makes a new noise that was never there before. Also all 3 times that my car was in for service over the last year it always took them one week to fix each item seriously! I have owned many different brands and this by far is the most incompetent service department I have ever been to period! Good luck if you have even a Ford to service their but if you have a Lincoln most definitely take it somewhere else if you can!",2.4

I receive text messages from him telling me the status of my car at least twice each time I take my car in which is a whole lot more than any other dealership I’ve been to.

917,"September 28, 2018","I waited for 4 hours in the lobby while work was done to my car that I asked to be apprised about prior to the work being done. I waited while the service gentleman ogled a young girl and though he saw me waiting to ask a question, helped someone else after hitting on this girl 
He then told me. when I finally interrupted him as he began to help yet a 3rd customer, to wait my turn even though i was there 1st. Also when he finally turned to me after a 4th customer all of which came after me that he’d give me a free oil change if I “came and talked to him” but no official coupon or redeemable item. Also I had an oil change done that day as well as a repair so why do I need a free oil change when I also pay for the plan? This guy was awful and soured my experience to Ford in general ",2.8
918,"September 27, 2018","I was warmly greeted within 5 minutes of my arrival.  Sam took over and assisted me in the office.  She was most helpful.  This was a re-call service appt.

My only concern was - when I made my appointment over the phone I was told the job would take the entire day.  I asked if the ""van"" was available for taking me home and bringing me back to the shop.  I was told ""we now have uber (or lyft) to take you"".  When I spoke with Sam she informed me that I would be taken home only.  If this is indeed only  one way transportation then I knew I would not be able to find someone to bring me back to the shop.

Sam was most helpful about the transportation problem arranged for the job to be done within 3 hours and gave me a $2.00-off ticket for the nearby coffee shop.  That was most appreciated",5.0

Helped me out easily and quickly and I left feeling great. Decided to book with them for my first service. Came in and was helped promptly. They even noticed I should have received a loaner car, but one was not set up, so they offered to have me driven to my office and my car would be returned to me later via valet. WOW now thats nice. Seta made me feel so welcome and explained the process. 
She even noticed when I bought the car my first service at the dealer was to be covered, I thought well I guess I missed that, but she transferred it over and I did not have to pay for it.

After I found this dealership I searched the reviews and found a bunch of 5 stars for a guy named Mark Aghili. I called and asked for him and we set up an appointment. Mark was absolutely the BEST salesmen I've ever encountered -- in that he didn't act like a typical salesman at all. He was very calm and pressure free. He listened to everything I wanted and I really felt like he was trying to work with me to get the best deal. At no point did I feel like I was being talked into something I didn't want. And indeed the car I walked in wanting -- a car I thought I'd start with but figured would be out of my price range -- was the car I ended up getting AND at a fair price.

This is the second time I had to take my CMax in for a stuck driver’s side door.  The first time they told me that that was part of a recall on the CMax and they fixed for free. 
The fix lasted a week and then the door got stuck again. I took it back in and they said that it wasn’t covered by the recall and it would be $420+. 
I declined as I’m preparing to look for a new car in a few months anyway.  But I am now pretty certain I won’t be getting another Ford.

My was SUV was work on TWICE FOR TWO DAYS at a time 48 Hrs each Two times it was there.
Mario failed to explained Why my SUV still had severe stains on the Roof and Brush Buffer marks on the side panel between the front passenger door and rear door.
He did not offer to ""CORRECT"" And  Not APOLOGIZE "" for the Poor Quality of work perform by his employess.
Instead of addressing the problems.He went into a long LECTURE, ON Black VEHICLES. The more you looked you would find more marks,and stains. His final commend was to take pictures send them to FORD for repainting Roof, because the paint now is very thin ....However, it would still have a problem.  ""Hard to Beleive That, Then why Paint ""????
ON July 24th 2018, at the time of purchase.Written disclosure or verbal was not provided regarding severe stains on the Paint and Windshield would not be removed to its original Factory Paint Appearance.

I'm a First time Ford Buyer and New Client of Star Dealership Company.
After your Body Shop Manager Mario negative remarks and bad experience with this vehicle.
I'am very disappointed and depressed I purchase this Ford Edge.
My family and I have not had peace and enjoyment.

971,"September 12, 2018","My 2005 Ford Focus needed the air conditioner fixed and new tires. Both these items were left over from a previous visit 2 weeks earlier. 
I brought the car to the dealer about 8:00 am the first day. Near the end of the day I was told the tires were changed but the air conditioner would need more time. They set me up with a rental car for the evening. Near the end of the next day I was told it needed a new compressor for the air conditioning. Unfortunately they did not order this part early enough to be delivered that day. As it was Friday I was told to keep the rental car over the weekend. 
The day after the weekend, the service representative did not show up for work. Apparently this means no one should work on the vehicles he was managing. I did talk to another rep and she said they still needed to order two bolts for the installation. I had to use the rental car for another night.

Then I was told they missed the cut off time for a part so had to wait another day.  Then told the part didn't arrive.  Then told the part was defective.  Then told the bill would be $1400 (all via email btw).  Then heard nothing from the dealership for days.  

I reached out to Alex Tamez, the General Manager, via email to voice my concerns.  No response.  I left him a VM on Thursday.  No response.  I left him a VM on Friday.  No response.

When the fob still didn’t work they said they would try to reporogram it for $145.00! in less than 5 min they came back and said that the FOB was broken and I needed to buy a new one.  Total cost for programming and new fob WITHOUT cutting the metal key was $363.00!   I asked for the old broken fob back and they said they threw it away as normal procedure, but when I insisted they got it out of the trash and gave it to me.   That night I went home stuck the supposedly broken key fob into the slot in the car and followed the reprogramming instructions in the manual and the old key fob reprogramming worked just fine.  Really, $145 for that!  I don’t even think they tried to reprogram it!  They just lead you down the path to milk you for every dollar they can.   I plan to go back tomorrow and try and return this new keyfob and complain about how I was able to program that key fob in 2 min, when there service department told me nearly immediately me that it was completely broken, and then took over an hour to program the new one they forced me to buy.",1.6

1025,"October 15, 2016","Sales:
I tried to purchase a vehicle in April from Star Lincoln in Glendale, CA without avail.  I went in with printout of the same vehicle (identically equipped) from a local competitor with similar miles and said ""If you could come within $500 of this price, I would rather purchase from Star as it is closer to my home.""  They tried to explain that it is not the same vehicle when was clearly the same except for the color (black vs. red).  I am a realist and understand not all deals can be made based on a number of variables.  They did not want to make the sale, so I purchased from Vista Lincoln (GREAT dealership!) that evening. 

Fast forward approx. 30 days ..... 

Service:
I took the vehicle I purchased in for service as there was a suspension/steering issue.  They said they fixed the issue and replaced a strut.  After getting it home (nearly 10 days later), one issue was fixed and another created with the steering. I brought it back that week and another part was replaced.  Got it home and the same issue was there (approx. 10 more days later).  I made an appointment, brought it back and another MAJOR part was replaced.  Got it home, same issue existed.  
By the sixth time I brought it back (yes, 6th!), and after being in one of their loaner cars for over 30 days between May 1 and September 30), I was told ""the noise/feeling is normal.""  This was after multiple service advisors and the service manager (Manny) all sat in the vehicle and agreed prior to taking the vehicle in that there was an issue.  It took a call to Lincoln customer service to start a complaint process to get anything moving forward.    
The General Manager at Star Lincoln in Glendale, CA and I connected and he asked if I could bring the car by so he could personally drive the vehicle (Alex).  He was very nice and genuinely seemed as if he cared.   I drove to the dealership and he drove the vehicle and agreed there seemed to be an issue as he never felt steering like mine in another vehicle.  He asked what he could do as I explained that I had an appointment to bring the vehicle to another dealership for another opinion.   He said he wished he could have one last shot at it as he would ""personally oversee the repair.""  Again, he seemingly seemed like he wanted to figure it out, I agreed and he whisked me off to service and put me in a loaner minutes later.  Approx. seven (7) days later, he informed me that the issue was ""normal"" like the tech and Service Manager said.  He was very nice about it, but I knew he was wrong and was nearly infuriated and frustrated at that point.  In my mind, Lincoln would never be able to compete against the other luxury brands with dealerships like Star and I gave up.  I wasted enough valuable time and was on my way to trading the car in for a Lexus which is what it replaced.  I never had such an issue with Lexus (or Audi, Nissan, Honda, Chevrolet, Infiniti, etc.).  
After sharing my disbelief with my assigned customer service representative, she suggested that I bring the vehicle to another dealership for one last opinion as her hands were tied (at this point, I was ready to go to arbitration per the Lemmon Laws in California and actually started filling out the paperwork).  I chose to give it one last try and brought it to Advantage Lincoln in Duarte, CA, where they took me in with open arms.  After actually listening to what I had to say, they found the part that was causing the issue and replaced it.  Less than one week later, I had the car back and guess what, it was fixed! Moving forward, I am driving 25 miles out of my way to service our two Lincoln vehicles at Advantage as they earned my trust, respect and ultimately, my business.  
While all this was happening, I had my wife's vehicle in for service at the same time (we were expecting our first vehicle back by this time) which is under factory warranty.  They did find that her battery was weak and needed a replacement, but wanted to charge us over $160 to replace it.  Had my wife picked up the vehicle, she would have paid, but luckily I asked ""why would we pay when it is under warranty?”  It turns out the service manager did not check to see if it was under warranty.  Really? 
At the end of the day, Star Lincoln in Glendale, CA has fundamental communication and systems challenges to overcome as they are greatly flawed.  Things happen in business, I get it.  This situation was simply ridiculous, avoidable and probably due to the laziness of people who did not want to take the time to find the real issue.  After reading a number of reviews on this dealership, it seems to be a common thread.  
I can say that Vista Lincoln was GREAT to deal with on a purchase.  As a person that has owned 24 vehicles in my lifetime, I have seen the good and the bad from the Midwest to West Coast.  Vista Lincoln was open, honest and genuine from the get go.  Not like Star Lincoln in Glendale, CA.  
I can also say that based on my experience with dealership service departments, Greg at Advantage Lincoln in Duarte, CA is world class.  He communicates with the customer, provides updates and is honest about his findings.  Not like Star Lincoln in Glendale, CA.  He earned my trust to the pint that I said “If you tell me the issue is normal as Star Lincoln in Glendale, CA  stated, I will admit I am wrong an 10 dozen doughnuts to the Star Lincoln in Glendale, CA service department as an apology (I can admit when I am wrong).”  As you read above, I did not have to buy the doughnuts as Advantage Lincoln in Duarte, CA found the issue on the first try.  
I would not recommend Star Lincoln/Ford in Glendale, CA in any capacity.  Buyer beware.

Star matched price from Vista, however, they could not deliver as promised.  Engine had to be built at manufacturer.  Ok I can understand if there was to be delay due to that.  However, delays kept mounting.  In the meantime I have a rental car.  Star was unwilling to work with me about providing alternate transportation, cover rental costs or anything.  Whenever I called, they had to ""get back to me"".  Which they NEVER did.  There had been THREE delays in delivery.  No apologies, no offers of compensation.  I had no guaratee that there might be more delays, and be kept hanging.  Customer service is below the 1 rating.  They are not willing to go the extra to provide customer service.

It's already 4pm and they don't have an actual diagnosis for the car because ""we think your battery is dead and your ugh low on gas"", and they have not started work on my car. Even though there was no diagnosis for my car because even though they are a dealer they can't jump my battery, Bill here still tried charging me the $150 diagnosis fee.
