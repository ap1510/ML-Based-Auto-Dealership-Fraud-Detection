11,"April 14, 2020",I came in for a recent P201 error code that needed programing and replacement for my electronic throttle control. I also needed to change out my brake and CVT fluid as well. My adviser Johnny Lam came out masked up but with a friendly greet! I explained to him the situation and he listened to what I had to say. I always do my own research before coming to see a mechanic shop and I appreciate advisers who have real technical knowledge rather than sales first mentality. He even insisted I did not need to replace my ECT but I wanted a peace of mind so I asked for it done anyways since I already bought the parts. I appreciated Johnny's honest feedback and did not try to up-sell me additional services. Overall this was my first time at Steven Creeks Honda; I like the atmosphere and customer service so far. I would definitely considered my next service here.,5.0

16,"April 03, 2020","I was visiting a friend in San Jose and decided to test drive 3 models as I wanted to buy a smaller car.  The Honda dealership in San Francisco, only 3 blocks from my residence did not give me much attention.  Perhaps, I did not appear to be a serious buyer.  At Stevens Creek Honda, I was able to test drive all 3 models.  It was not my intention to actually purchase a car that day, but the young salesman, Scott Lien, was extremely pleasant and patient.  Answered all my questions.   I made the decision to buy a car on the spot!!  I found the whole dealership very well run and the employees are supportive of each other.   The manager Amine Kedir was informative, attentive, convincing and gave me a decent discount.   All the paperwork was processed efficiently and by Phillip Nguyen.

treats because I almost always wait there while the service is done.
     My most recent Service Adviser was Steve Seyuin, two days ago.  Steve especially impressed me.
He did everything with care.  We walked around the car together for awareness of any defects, scratches, etc.  Then he measured my tires for wear and looked under the hood. After he had done this with concentration, he took me around the car to explain what he found and without hurry.  He
was prompt in coming out when they were finished and sent me followup emails with a summary of the work done and also a copy of a service I had declined for my records.  He was especially courteous when I declined the wheel alignment because the co-owner refused it.  We will do it no doubt next time.  I hope I can work with Steve on a regular basis!",5.0

It usually takes long time to negotiate and etc when it comes to buying or leasing a vehicle but this time was hassle free.

If you're shopping for the Honda models, ask for Tony Chang. Also, the finance manager was nice too. No pressure with the extended warranty and etc since I mentioned I always lease every three years.

51,"February 18, 2020","I'm really impressed with Honda of Stevens Creek. My neighbor bought a car from them years ago so I was aware of the dealership but I didn't need a new car until recently. I finally needed a new car - I pretty much knew what I wanted and Honda of Stevens Creek was one of the only dealerships in the Bay Area that had the model, trim and color I wanted in stock. Turns out these guys have fantastic inventory. While I was looking around their lot, they had two Civic Type R's on the showroom floor ready to go - none of the other Honda dealers I visited had any at all. I was impressed!

Anyway, Victor Bradley was my salesperson and he was GREAT to work with. I let him know what I was interested in and how I was planning to use the car. He helped me confirm I was making the right choice and then got me an excellent price, right up front. Victor is a young guy and really personable. He is easy to talk with and sincere - everything he promised me, he took care of immediately - all with a smile and without any sense of pressure on my part.

Three things made my car shopping experience at Honda of Stevens Creek great:
* They had what I wanted in stock.
* I got a great price, right up front.
* Most importantly - Victor Bradley took great care of me and made me feel really comfortable through the entire process. 

I'll certainly be back to Honda of Stevens Creek for future purchases. Highly recommended!",5.0

55,"February 13, 2020","I've bought a number of vehicles here over the years, and it has always been a great experience. My most recent purchase was at the beginning of February 2020. The sales staff I dealt with Sales Manager Amine Kedir and Sales Consultant Brian Plowman were top notch. I was debating between two different models and they made sure to have both models available for my wife and I to test drive. Brian answered any questions we had about the vehicles and once we made a decision on which model we wanted Amine found the color we wanted at another dealership and arranged for it to be transported to their dealership for pick up the next day. The financing portion was as fast as I have ever had purchasing a vehicle. The general manager Joe Spurrier even stopped by to make sure things were going well and his staff was meeting our expectations. Not only did they meet our expectations, they exceeded them. If you are in the market for a Honda in the Bay Area you can not beat the experience of Honda of Stevens Creek.
Their service department is also top notch, I've been bringing vehicles here for over 13 years. It is always a good experience and fair pricing.",5.0

57,"February 07, 2020","So my husband and I was all over Stevens Creek Blvd looking to buy a car. We decided to end our night at Stevens Creek Honda because we had our eye on a Toyota throughout the day, but made sure we went to check out Toyota‚Äôs main rival, Honda. We were greeted by Abdel, it was 5PM, Exhausted from test driving all these kinds of vehicles throughout the day and Abdel approaches us and starts the sale. I‚Äôll be honest, his approach towards us was a bit rough, but may be because of us being super exhausted from car shopping, and him trying to sell cars throughout the day? Not sure, but i definitely felt some tension for some odd reason. We told him our needs and he pointed us to the 2019 CRV. He laid out the difference between the 2020 and the 2019 and no doubt had us test driving the 2019 CRV. I fell in love with it. I am not a car person, luckily my husband is, but all the nicks and gadgets this car has, had me already feeling like driving this vehicle will be super comfortable. Im more of the user experience type versus the mechanical type. I was sold. That Toyota vehicle we eyed throughout the day was already past my rearview mirror. My husband asked more questions about the CRV and Abdel definitely chose the right words to convince my husband. He told me to chose this over that Toyota. THEN, we finally told him our budget. It stung when he told us that we wouldnt be able to get the vehicle within our price range. I was disappointed, considering we had to stick within our budget. He knew we really wanted this vehicle so he said, he will try to work a deal. We went inside, waited a few minutes and he came back to us with amazing news. I can‚Äôt believe he helped us get into a vehicle i fell in love with, at the maximum of our budget! I was amazed. 

The process after was smooth for the most part. We had to pick up the vehicle a few days after due to some technical glitches on my part. Once we picked up the car, MIKE was amazing. He gave us quick tutorials about how to work the infotainment center, and other things. We came to pick up the vehicle from a rental and he assisted us in returning the vehicle. TALK ABOUT GOING OUT OF YOUR WAY TO MAKE THINGS EASY AND PAINLESS FOR CUSTOMERS.

This team is beyond amazing. Will be buying our future cars here from now on. Thank you Abdel, Mike and Amine for all the help and understanding!",5.0

88,"November 05, 2019","I started my car search online and I knew exactly what I wanted. I looked up the Kelley Blue Book fair price and through their website I requested quotes for the car I wanted from six local Honda dealerships. Every dealership I contacted refused to send me a quote and opted instead to invite me to come over to the dealership to have a test drive except one - Stevens Creek Honda (SCH). SCH sent me a detailed quote the very next day and the pricing was actually slightly LOWER than the Kelley Blue Book fair price. I was a little skeptical and thought that they would try to jack up the price once I went in. When we arrived I asked for Abdel, the salesperson who emailed me the quote, and he was busy so they immediately asked another salesperson to help us. He walked us out to show us the cars that matched what we wanted and we chose one. This all happened within 10-minutes of our arrival. They sent the car back to have it washed for us and when Abdel was free we sat down to figure out the price. He brought a hard copy of the quote he sent me and simply asked how we wanted to pay. There was no negotiating the price higher at all! We left with the exact car we wanted at the price we thought was fair. When the car was washed Abdel sat down with me to help program the electronics to our preferences. It was the most pleasant car purchase I have ever had and I‚Äôm old so that‚Äôs saying something!

107,"October 03, 2019","I will start my review from the moment I walked in the dealership, we went on a Saturday so it was very hectic. My first impression walking into the dealership was a bit overwhelming and there was a lot going on but there were a lot of customers so it is understandable. I was not approached by anyone upon walking in which was kind of upsetting but once again it was very busy so I was understanding. I walked up to the front desk and told them that I was there to test drive a vehicle in which they also seemed a bit confused and sort of hesitant to help. I'm not sure what their names were but it was an older man and a girl sitting at the desk. My experience however was turned around when Qadeer walked over and was super friendly and willing to work with us. He immediately approached me since he was not previously there and pulled up my information, since I had called beforehand, and ran in the back and grabbed the keys for us to test drive the vehicle. We told him what we were looking for as far as payments and pricing and he made it happen. He brought us a very reasonable deal that we were unable to refuse. We then  proceeded to Siddique's office where we were immediately welcomed and he made us feel comfortable and at home. He was very friendly and talkative and was honest about pricing and add on's. We were able to close the deal on our 2009 Infiniti FX35 and took the car home with us. Thanks to Qadeer and Siddique we had a wonderful experience and would definitely recommend them to family and friends. ",5.0

109,"September 30, 2019","On 9/28/2019, I stopped by the Service Center of Honda of Stevens Creek, due to a warning light on my car‚Äôs dashboard that turned on while I was driving on the freeway. I made an appointment with Glen. When I arrived, there were 2 lines of cars, about 4 deep on both lines, and so I was expecting a long wait. However, in less than 1 minute, a service person came up to my car, took pertinent information, then told me that he will inform Glen of my arrival. Glen arrived soon after. He took a look at the warning light, explained to me that it was a tire pressure warning that can be because of a nail puncture. He reviewed and apprised me of my car‚Äôs history. Glen checked gauges, quickly made some calculations then recommended the necessary maintenance that will be due shortly. He explained the service and the maintenance that will be done at that time, told me an estimated waiting time, escorted me to the waiting area, showed me the coffee machine and the snacks that were available. He served me popcorn (my choice). He came back to give me updates periodically, then escorted me to my car when it was completed. 
Overall, my experience with the service was definitively impressive. Glen was exceedingly knowledgeable in answering my questions and in explaining not just the current issue with my car, but also in acquainting me of my car‚Äôs history such that it was understandable to me, a non-technical, just-basic car know-how type of person. He was respectfully and kindly straight-forward and gave me realistic expectations on the waiting time. He followed up periodically with updates, that to me is excellent customer service.  His forward-looking recommendations are much appreciated as it would save me time and gas doing another visit. Once again, IRS - Incredibly Remarkable Service.

This the first used car we have purchased in several decades.  The only concern I had was that the vehicle came with a single key and remote.  Struck me as odd.  When I got home I went on youtube to see how to make a second remote and key.  What I found was interesting.  Seems it is common practice to supply purchasers of used vehicles with only a single key and remote.  Strange since in the past we have purchased five new vehicles.  All came with two remotes and keys, plus a valet key. Sometime back we misplaced a remote and key to our 2017 Toyota Sienna.  My wife had a duplicate set make at Capital Toyota for $385.00.  So my thought is if I go back to Honda of Stevens Creek for a second remote and key it'll cost me in the neighborhood of $385.  Unbelievable.

136,"September 01, 2019","I had my 2004 CRV in for a passenger air bag recall.  That service was fine.  The shuttle ride home was another matter.  Six passengers; I lived the closest to the dealership, 2.7 miles.  How long was I riding in the shuttle--one hour and 25 minutes!   The driver uses an app to determine his route, and apparently it minimizes his time, not the passengers.  The four passengers who needed drop-offs in North San Jose were taken first; then the driver circled back around and dropped off the two of us closest to the dealership.  Had he gone in reverse order, he would have added maybe 10-15 minutes to the time of the farthest passengers and left himself with a dead run by himself back to the dealership.  That would have been a much more reasonable trade-off instead of adding an hour+ to the times of the two passengers closest to the dealership.

Rely most on error codes from computer, rather than driving a car. Thinks that cars are for showcase. 

Took my car for power loss problem. After diagnoses, suggested me a possible solution, agreed to change the parts. Still problem was persistent, asked to look more into it, lastly says cant find the problem, take your car, otherwise will charge you with penalties $40 per each night. 

Initial problem I had in my car was there, changed the parts the way they want by misinterpreting the information with the problem statement, and wasted my 4 days. Problem still unresolved. Asked me to come back when my engine fails.

MY brakes shoes were checked this visit and were at 3, brand new is 3.5!
Dan Nguyen was excellent job!
The big question for you folks is "" who was the person with the very bad rear brakes""!!!!

A oil changed early last year I asked the service person about my front tire wear.
I was told my OEM tires look great by your service person!
Less than 300 miles later I had a leak in one tire.
I was very close to a tire dealer so pulled in to fix the flat.
They said they could not let me dive the car because the front tire wear was so bad!
This was the same tire wear that I asked the service person about.
The edges/crown of the front tires were worn down to less that 3/16 of an inch of rubber!!!!!
I was told the alignment was way off. I was given a great deal on new ties and alignments.
I mentioned this problem to the lead person of your service people. 

I don't see Dan's name on this web page and I did not use any other employee
So I pick the lead person to be able too release this review!

Naresh responded to my quote request again with the same proactivity as before and I proceeded to schedule a test drive appointment with him.

Being a first-time new carbuyer, I had a lot of internal anxiety about how this would go. But from the first interaction with Naresh, that anxiety was whisked away. Because I did a ton of research, I knew exactly what I wanted and wasn't going to change my mind. Naresh recognized that and focused on highlighting everything I needed to know about the car I picked, instead of trying to sell me on something else. Despite the fact that he was juggling another customer at the same time, I felt I had Naresh's full attention, he guided me through the process, and by the end of it, we were talking about how he did a great job and how we were glad he was my car salesman.

247,"February 18, 2019","‚ÄúQuality is much better than quantity.  One home-run is much better than two doubles.‚Äù -Steve Jobs-

This quote from Steve Jobs defines the professional yet compassionate service I received from Mark Wright out at Honda of Stevens Creek.  My family and I recently purchased a 2019 Honda Odyssey Elite from them and received the best deal in California! For months, I contacted many dealerships and couldn‚Äôt get a good deal.  It felt as if I failed myself and my family.  Then I met Mark.  His no hassle, no stress buying experience exceeded my expectations.  Mark‚Äôs no fluff, no nonsense service was exactly what I was looking for.  Honda made an excellent choice in hiring Mark Wright for sales.  I now picture Honda of Stevens Creek to be an honest, friendly, and professional dealership due to Mark‚Äôs splendid service.  Thank you for your fantastic commitment to the customer.

I highly recommend to purchase your next Honda at Honda of Stevens Creek.",5.0

Juan Melendez was my service advisor and he was amazing! He walked me through the process and we even discussed an issue that was happening with the sliding door.

Given that I have all my credit locked, and I only wanted to unlock it for a few minutes so they could verify it proved to be difficult for the Stevens Creek process.  Experian has a  option that allows me to give a one time use password to a creditor to check my credit and then Experian immediately re-locks my credit.

A tough very intermittant problem with the main PCM computer module was fixed with many hours of troubleshooting by technician Tino. My normal non- Honda mechanic could not pin down the problem but Tino went so far as calling me to go on a 40 min test drive with him to try to get the failure. Finally after 2 more days it acted up when he drove it yet again. Turns out it was a computer covered by the California 8 year/80K smog component warranty so the whole repair was at no charge. Tino went beyond the call of duty and so did Jeff the service writer. I will buy my next Honda from this dealer! service is everything.

342,"October 25, 2018","I have been researching Hybrid cars for over 6 months, and when it came to see what my choices were. There was two dealerships to deal with for the needs I wanted. I called Honda of Steven Creek first, and spoke to Mike. I told him what I was looking for and had a Kelley Blue Book value for my car for trade in.

He asked to come in and see for myself, of the 2019 Honda Insight. That was one I was looking at, so I came to the dealership and came to Mike, and he showed me all the Insights there were there on the lot and I was looking at the 2019 Honda Insight Touring Hybrid. He allowed me to see in side, and sit down in it and see how I feel. I was very impressed.

I told him of the Kelley Blue Book value for my car and if he can work with it. Mike sat down with me and gave me a good idea what he can do, and he had his manager look at what we are doing and offered me a better deal for my trade in. Mike was there to be my mentor on this deal, and when the final numbers came out I was very happy and sealed the deal with a handshake.

After that I did all the paperwork that took less than an hour, and I was in the dealership for a total of 2 hours and DROVE away in a 2019 Honda Insight Touring Hybrid. Mike was there to show me all the buttons do for the car, and I like buttons. 

I was very impressed with his customer service, I didn't have any pressure on me, Mike showed me all the cars I was looking at, and took time giving me insights (no pun) on those vehicles. I would recommend anyone to Mike, and I look forward to deal with the dealership for my service needs and help me with anything I need.

Thanks Mike, for you ways of being a salesman. I am glad I called this dealership first and happy with the results.

354,"October 10, 2018","I needed to replace my last american car -Mercury Villager (donated to Wounded Veterans) . So I did my homework of CARFAX and CARGURUS.  Got a good deal from Honda Stevens Creek. I do have a prior Honda CR-V 2013 that is performing fantastic. So, because I do all maintenance is better if I stick with same brand. The offered car was Honda CR_V 2016 LX ( I do not go for all the extras that only make eventual problems bigger). I primarily dealt with Phil Ha. He was very fast responding all my questions and providing, E-Mailed, CARFAX. I texted him for an appointment and his reply was --come now- (no surprise there). The car was clean / no structural problems (I like to crawl under the car to check) / 42k Mi./ all fluids ok / no oil leaks / tires in very good shape / test drive OK . We negotiated  for a discount , and Phil broke all time records going to and fro the General Manager office.  I got 1/2 of the asked discount which was probably a fair deal. 
Upon signing all papers I found out that there was only one key available. That did not cut it for me. So negotiating again and Phil again to a fro record. Finally they accepted responsibility for a replacement for the second, programmed,  key and a newer car jack. 
Of the 15 used cars that I bought in my extensive life, this probably was the most fair and ""easy"". deal I ever had. I am very satisfied, after running the car for 1 week, with this purchase. 
I will have to deal now on maintaining the cleaning of  intake valves‚Äô carbon accumulation. That is Honda faulty engineering and not the dealership. The Direct fuel injection does provide benefits, but in my book having to clean deposits every 10k miles is a nonsensical engineering mistake. So I envision that I will get very proficient in either blasting the valves with crushed walnut shells or doing a chemical treatment. 
All in all I want to recognize a fair and friendly dealer, on Phil, and a job well done for the unknown  general manager having Phil there.

366,"September 28, 2018","I want to start by saying that I am not a fan of these types of correspondences but I feel the need to advocate for myself as a returning customer and others. I believe it was 9/24 when I booked a 7am appointment over the phone for an oil change for 9/26. I made sure to confirm that the car would be ready by 8am, 8:15am latest. To ensure this, I dropped the car off the night before and noted on the key slip that I had a 7am appointment. I called at 7:05, no answer. Then again at 7:13, answered; after about 15 minutes, the receptionist was able to track down the service advisor and put some heat on the, for lack of a better word, situation. At that point, the receptionist informed me the car would be ready in 30 to 45 minutes. By the time our call ended at 7:23 (even though the car had been there at the time of the scheduled appointment time) this would work - I‚Äôd make it to work nearly on time. Ten minutes later the service advisor sent the text to confirm the service requested. Red flag, this indicated  that the service had not begun yet. 8:10 I arrived to pick the car up and waited an additional twenty minutes. It took 1.5 hours from the appointed service time to to the key being returned. I don‚Äôt find this acceptable. To be very transparent, I was annoyed with the situation because I took advantage of the ability to schedule an early morning appointment and option to drop the car off in advance. When would the car have been serviced if I did not call? 

Furthermore, if an oil change only takes between 30-45 minutes, as the receptionist suggested on our call, why did it take in total 1.5 hours? In the future should I not drop my car off the night before if I have a 7am appointment, does this cause confusion? If I schedule the first appointment of the day for a service that takes 30-45 minutes, should I assume it will take longer, and why? 

I am sorry to say I am left feeling less than pleased. 

I am open to hearing your perspective and solution/plan of action for my next visit. ",2.0

449,"June 12, 2018","This review is for the Service department at Stevens Creek Honda, and specifically for Service Manager Ricardo Pimentel and Service Advisor Summer Pettigrew. Do NOT bring your Honda to this service department if you want any semblance of Customer Service, or your vehicle to be correctly diagnosed and repaired in a timely manner.

I brought my vehicle to this dealership on 5/17/18 because it was blowing hot air out of the A/C. Stevens Creek Honda did a diagnostic and determined that I needed a new A/C Compressor, which was covered under warranty but they could not complete the repair due to a nationwide backorder on a part, with no ETA. I waited two weeks to hear back from this dealership, leaving numerous voicemails for Summer Pettigrew but she failed to return a single call. Fed up with them not returning a single phone call, I stopped in one day to see Service Manager Ricardo Pimentel, who was rude, unapologetic, and refused to do anything to get me into a conforming vehicle. I asked him about a rental car because driving a car with a brand-new, under warranty car with black leather interior in June with no A/C and no ETA for a repair is not acceptable. He said he would ""look into it"" for me and get back to me the next day- It's been almost a month and I haven't received a single phone call about my car from Stevens Creek Honda. I called HondaCare to inquire about my warranty contract, which indeed say I'm entitled to a rental car while waiting for parts or the vehicle is being repaired, and the rep over the phone said in these cases they can make accommodations for extended rental car periods, but the case needs to be opened through the dealership and there has been no activity on my account, aka Ricardo Pimentel didn't even bother to pick up the phone regarding my issue.

I made complaints to Honda Corporate, who were communicative until they got back to me saying this dealership won't return their calls and there isn't anything they can do in this instance as they are privately owned and operated.

The best part? I was driving around with no A/C for two weeks after bring my car to this service department, which Stevens Creek Honda service reps told me ""Just drive with your windows down"", until I took my car to a different Honda dealership up the Peninsula- they were able to complete my repair in ONE DAY and my A/C seems to be working fine to this point. 

These people, specifically Service Manager Ricardo Pimentel, are extremely dishonest and a disgrace to anybody that works in a customer-service type job. How hard is it to pick up the phone and return a phone call? Apparently it's very difficult for these people. 

I recommend you take your car to any other Honda service department if you run into an issue. Anderson, Capitol, Serramonte- driving to any of these locations will serve you and your vehicle better. At the very least different dealerships give you the courtesy of returning your phone calls.

Do not trust Service Advisor Ricardo Pimentel or anything that he might promise you. This Service Department even refuses, to this day, to provide me with a completed work order stating their diagnosis and they were unable to fix the vehicle to conforming standards.

I did eventually get a call from a gentlemen named Richard Artell, who introduced himself as the Service/Parts Director for Stevens Creek Honda. He apologized on behalf of his incompetent staff and offered to take care of me when the next service is due, but when I call back the next week I was informed he no longer works at this dealership.",1.2

481,"May 04, 2018","Working with Daniel and Mikey to lease my 2018 Accord 2.0T Sport was a very fluid and great experience. Initially came in to test drive the car a few months back and was greeted by Amir very nicely and he quickly got me into the car I wanted to drive and explained a bunch of the cool features to me and let me try them out. I was pretty much sold at that point but I wanted to do my due diligence and check out some other cars. Fast forward a few months, I made the decision to go with the accord because it‚Äôs far superior to anything in its class and has such great ratings but above all it‚Äôs just a really fun car to drive.

I initiated contact with Daniel over the web and he quickly sent me some of the details for the specific car I wanted over email. At that point I had a pretty good idea what to expect. When I went in to lease the car, I brought a trade in to use as a down payment to lower the monthly lease payments. The car was appraised very quickly and they actually gave me more for the car than I had expected them to which was a pleasant surprise. Daniel was extremely busy with a few other customers but made sure that someone helped me right away. Then I had the pleasure of working with Mikey who was also fantastic. I knew my price point and I asked him for it straight up. It only took him a few short minutes to come back with the price I wanted which was actually quite shocking. I was happy. I asked for a maintenance plan and they added it on for a very reasonable price. 

Then it came time to see the actual car before signing the papers. (It was in storage and they had to bring it over. It didn‚Äôt take long) I had only seen pictures online so I wanted to make sure I was getting what I paid for. When the car arrived I noticed something was off- the rims were different than the ones shown in the picture online. When I inquired about it they said that the picture online was a mistake and the nice black rims I wanted would cost extra... a lot extra. I was kind of disappointed and told them they should still honor the price they gave me because it was their fault that the picture was wrong. While I understand that the upgraded rims cost more, they were the reason that I wanted that particular car from that particular dealership. After some negotiation with Mikey and Daniel, they didn‚Äôt give them to me for free but they did give me a good discount on them because of the mistake. It probably wasn‚Äôt their fault that the picture was wrong so I didn‚Äôt want to be too much of a jerk about it. Faycal, the gentleman in the finance department already had the paperwork ready when I got to that point and I was in and out of his office in less than 20 minutes which was awesome! In the end, they did what they had to do to make me happy, and happy I was... and still am. I got a great deal on an amazing car. 

They didn‚Äôt have the beautiful black aforementioned rims in stock so they had to order them and they arrived within a week.They replaced the rims and let me keep the old ones. Rosalie in the service department was super nice and let me keep the old rims in their warehouse until I could get a bigger car to pick them up. The rims could‚Äôve probably fit in the accord‚Äôs HUGE trunk but the service team didn‚Äôt want to take a chance with scratching the interior of the car, which I really appreciated. Rosalie was very good at keeping me updated with the status of the work being done and the entire service staff was super professional and extremely nice.

All in all I would say that this is the best car leasing/buying experience that I ever had. Staff was friendly, helpful, fair, honest, transparent and I didn‚Äôt feel like they were trying to take advantage of me. Usually car salesmen get a bad rap, but these guys break the stereotypes. Honda of Stevens Creek, you guys rock! ",5.0

What impressed me the most was the protocol. I was surprised when he ask me to open up my vehicle's hood and had me turn the wheel towards the right.  The reason being was to check fluid levels and tire thread depth. None of the other Honda service center performed this.  The other difference was that at the other Honda dealerships I was given an estimation copy of how much the service was going to cost.  Here CD told me the estimation which I found quite odd.  CD was also able to honor another Honda dealership's service coupon so as long as they were a Honda dealership working the South Bay. Let your service advisor know you have a coupon ahead of time.  Will be returning again to service my additional Honda vehicles which I own.  There is plenty of seating and a large tv in the waiting area as well as complimentary hot drinks and soda machines.

Mr. Nyam was pleasant to speak with, and was very patient in explaining all of the features of the car to me.  He was also very clear and concise about the lowest possible price the dealership would accept for a brand new Honda Odyssey.  I found Mr. Nyam‚Äôs straight-forward and honest demeanor to be very refreshing, especially compared to other dealerships that we had worked with in the past.  We double-checked the numbers he provided us with other Honda dealerships in the area, and it definitely was the lowest price we had seen (tied with Anderson Honda in Palo Alto).  Since Mr. Nyam was so patient and straight forward on the car-purchasing process, we sped through the purchase and car loan process in record time, and before I knew it, I was on my way home in my new vehicle.  

A few weeks later, when I had an issue with the DMV registration, I called Mr. Nyam and reached him immediately, and he was able to direct me to the correct person to talk to, and the DMV problem was resolved right away.

This time my car wasn't starting, I jumpstarted and took it to the dealership assuming its the battery issue. They said  to just look at the car, they will charge $70??!!! and then will provide a quote to fix the problem. I said I think the battery is at fault. I had replaced the last battery 3 years ago at this very dealership, so could you please check the battery. Again, they said you will have to pay 60% for the battery as it is still under partial warranty. I agreed. But then they came back and said, we will have to run diagnostics to claim warranty and will charge you another $40 over and above the battery price. So, paying 60% +$40 came close to putting in a brand new one, so I asked them to put in a new one. They changed the battery, service charge of approx $30 which 3 years ago was free of charge when you bought a new battery. Anyways, by the end of the day, my car wouldn't start again. This time I went to a local mechanic. He said the battery clamp is loose and tightened it, and thus the battery was leaking. It took him 2 minutes and charged me zero dollars.

594,"November 26, 2017","I was lucky enough to get a good price and selection as they closed out their 2017 CR-Vs in early November. As part of the Sonic dealership group, they have a team that sets prices, so it takes the haggling out of the process and you can purchase there knowing everyone who buys in the same timeframe is offered the same deal. 

Asad Hanif took the time to show me how Apple CarPlay worked. I was considering a Toyota RAV4 but was swayed by the features and the look of the redesigned CR-V. I went with the CR-V EX FWD. It has the Honda Sensing safety features whereas the CR-V LX does not. 

The fuel injected engine gets 4 mpg better overall than a comparable Toyota RAV4 and that comes out to $1,000 savings in gas over five years. The two-tone interior has a nicer feel than the all black interior of the RAV4. The touchscreen is larger and easier to navigate with Apple CarPlay than the RAV4. A pushbutton parking break frees up console space and I like the dashboard layout on the CR-V.

So I went last week to this dealership and asked the person at the reception to test drive accord and civic hybrid. His replies were as follows 
1. There are no sales agent to take u on test drive, pls take an appointment.  ( there were two people from Honda standing right next to me also there was one guy roaming around outside who guided me inside ). So I guess they didn't think ill buy a car 
2. I booked an appointment and then I was asked very rudely by the same person accusingly that why in the world do I even want to buy hybrid and even went on explaining that he drives a Honda Civic and it's pretty good. Well if Honda doesn't want to sell hybrid why are u making them? 
3. Finally the worst part of this visit was , after all this he says ""I think"" we don't have any 2015 hybrids in the inventory. Well in today's hi tech world if someone says he thinks and cannot just check on his computer that just says it he is not interested in selling . I did check their inventory after coming back home and they did have hybrid cars in their inventory, it just indicated they don't want to sell!! 
Well I'll be writing my review to Honda directly also I hope they realise that this particular dealership has a big problem , they don't want to sell cars. 
Also to everyone who is going to this dealership to buy cars, pls go somewhere else the rating and reviews as per yelp are quite right and u will just be wasting ur valuable time. ",1.0

Within 20 minutes of talking with the salesperson (Sami), of which 10 were him going back and forth to whoever he needed to talk with for price consultation, we had agreed on a price. Or so we thought. We waited for the next 130 minutes for them to get the car and to meet with the finance guy. Eventually, the price they put on paper was higher than what we had agreed to. When we broke down the numbers, the manager pretty much told us that we did not have that price 'officially written down' and hence they could not honor it. The price was VERY CLEARLY written - as any one has bought a car before knows, we go back and forth with numbers written on paper, of course we had no signatures against it.
Long story short - don't go here. They clearly do not care or understand customer service or satisfaction.  ",1.0
736,"January 22, 2014","HONDA OF STEVEN CREEK TOOK ADVANTAGE OF ME
During the month of July, 2013 I feel I got defrauded by Honda of Steven Creek. I went in and spoke with car salesman Mike D. and I test drove a used 2010 Honda Accord. The car looked fine and felt fine, and I specifically asked Mike if this car had been in an accident and he said ""NO"". My cosigner and I proceeded to sign all documents. About two weeks after I went to get my windows tinted the tint shop informed me that one of my doors wobbled to much and that I should have it checked out. I took it to Honda Steven Creek recommended body shop AW Collision of San Jose and after their inspection they informed me that my car had in fact been in a car accident and someone attempted to cover it up making it an unsafe vehicle. The body shop told me the estimated cost to have this car repair would be $9,137!!!. I immediately took this issue to Honda Steven Creek and I spoke with Samantha E. and I explained my problem to her and I gave her a copy of the repair cost estimate and of course she told me that there was no one there to help me and to go home and she will show her boss my documents. During a period of 3-4 weeks I spoke with Subhash C. General Manager, Moe A. General Sales Manager and Abraham Finance. I begged them to please help me out with this unsafe vehicle. I informed them that I feel they took advantage of me by selling me a wrecked and unsafe vehicle and I simply wanted them to give me for what I'm paying for and after numerous of phone calls and three or four visits to Honda of Steven Creek dealership they refused to help me out making all sorts of excuses and disrespecting my cosigner and I. In addition they went as far as to tell me that Honda of Steven Creek had millions of dollars to spend in attorneys in case I wanted to sue them. As a result I contacted the auto fraud legal center and attorney Hawk and his firm decided to fight for my rights as a consumer and sue this dealership for their wrongdoing!!!!!!!!!My case is currently pending in California in the Santa Clara County Superior Court Civil Case Number 1-13-CV-254207, in which Honda of Steven Creek is doing business as Santa Clara Imported Cars, Inc.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 In addition we just had a mediation hearing on 01/15/2014, in which of course nothing happen at mediation thanks to their refusal. 
Overall, I'm an American guy that is just trying to make it.  I have two jobs and I am putting myself through college (Engineering major) I went to a Honda dealership and not to a mom and pop dealership in order to avoid these kinds of problems and honestly, because it was a Honda dealership I felt I can trust them and get myself a good reliable car. Unfortunately, Honda Steven Creek clearly took advantage of me and even after I took this problem to them they have refused to help me out. $9,137 is a lot of money for car repairs. I can see why they would like to dump this car on somebody and get it out of their dealership. Once again a huge corporation is taking advantage of the small people/consumer and tax payer. ",1.0

They told me some price on phone and when I went the place, They quoted much higher rate than what was told on phone.

And for used cars, They have a slogan,
If you are buying used car, You should not expect two keys or any remote.
I won't be surprised if they say,
You are buying used car, You should not expect car to have 4 wheels or car to work or you should not expect any key.

He came out and told me that honda will cover it.  So, he made appointment on Wednesday and also ordered part for me.  I showed up my appoinment hoping to have my seatbelt replace.

I told him that I will come back to see Dann because he was taking car my case.  So, I went home and coudn't wait to see Dann.  I came back on Friday and met Dann.

I was shocked but I didn't make big deal, I just want to get over it.  So, I dealt with him that I want to buy the seatbelt if he can give me discount.  He was ok and sent me to cashier.  So, I ended up pay $150 for my seatbelt.  I thought that was it and would not deal with these guys anymore.  I coudn't beleive when I put the seatbelt in my car, the sensor is not working at all.

I ask Dann if he could proof the part is good then I will happyily leave the store.  He told me that Honda doesn't need to prove it and gave me all cappy lectures and asked me to pay $150 to diagnose my car if I want to fix the sensor.

747,"November 23, 2008","Walked onto the lot and was suggested to work with Steve.  Steve is a salesman with integrity, no pressure, up front and honest.  It was a busy night, Steve told us when there were delays in getting in line to have the finance guy look at our offer.  We appreciated that.  What happened next was rather insulting, although, I know it's just business.  Steve had to be the messenger... we were completely lowballed (by $6000) with our trade-in.  He stated that they do not go by the ""blue book"" values.  So, my question is, why is it posted for consumers to see?  Stunned, we left and Steve lost a sale.  

If you're going to go to Honda of Stevens Creek, definitely work with Steve.  Easy going, knowledgeable and honest (what more can you ask for in a sales guy).  And beware of the ""haggling"" you have to deal with, I just don't have the tenacity to deal with that kind of business.  My trade in was a Saturn, and wanted to drive something different.  But, due to my less than perfect experience with Honda of Stevens Creek, I will be purchasing another Saturn which was Plan B.

To finish the story We went in and Steve helped us not only find the exact car but also get us a great rate. He said they use CUDL and it sends our application over to a bunch of credit unions instead of banks. We got a really great rate as the credit score was a little low but we pay everything on time. We left really happy and overall one of the easiest deals. My thanks to other Dealer Rater's for the tips to make it work out.",5.0
749,"August 18, 2008","We received a price over the internet from South Bay Honda. They didn't have the car we wanted on the premises so we went over to Honda of Stevens Creek to see the car in the color we wanted. When approached by salesmen, we told them we had gotten this price from South Bay. They told us that South Bay salespeople were ""liars"" and that they could not give us that price. We were appalled that they would outright use that word. We were really put off by these guys. When it turned out that indeed the South Bay salesperson never came though with the car, let alone the price (she didn't even show up for our appointment) we went back to Honda of Stevens Creek. On the day we were to pick up the car, the car was to be on the lot. My husband and the salesperson had to drive to another lot (took about 1 hour round trip) to get the car. Then we sat down to finalize the sale. We had the price that the sales person quoted us. The sales person told us that the manager said it was too low. We were down there ready to buy based on the agreed on  price. The sales person was a nice guy but he apparently should not have quoted a price he couldn't deliver on. It may be the game they play, make it the managers fault. In any case, the difference was about $150. The manager asked ""are you going to walk away from the car you want for $150?"" Indeed we did. They were dishonest. We will ever return there. We bought the car from Anderson Honda for the same price basically but the process was open, honest and straightforward.",1.8
750,"August 03, 2008","I have bought a used Acura from this dealership that was previously owned in the State of Florida.  It is still my car, and there have not been any mechanical repair issues.  Also, the price is reasonable.

There was something I liked about the salesperson.  However, when it turned out that the vehicle did not have a spare tire, he followed instructions and took one from one of their other automobiles for use in mine.  If I am not mistaken, that was the end of my dealings with him.  He said he was seeking employment elsewhere.

The person who processed the paperwork evidently had a preference for Cantonese, Mandarin, or something else.  I purchased a warranty through him, but eventually cancelled within a 60 day period.  I only elected the insurance minimums and added comprehensive coverage with a $500 deductible.  Leaving almost immediately to drive to the mid-west, I still did not have an official license plate. 

After driving further than halfway across the (contiguous) country, I went to the carwash.  The next day, I observed faint scratches throughout the car's paint.  Subsequent inquiry through an attorney general's office lead to the impression that the service did not cause the damage; but unmasked a previous carwash-type problem(s).  Fortunately, insurance still provided ~ $1,300, and I saved the claim through multiple winters.  (In the nearer future, a new policy with a lower deductible would pay $3,000+ for hail damage).

When the warranty trial ran out, I asked about a different priced option but communication skills were once again lacking from the dealership.  After reviewing the materials sent to me, I did not buy.

After at least two months, I was still waiting for my title and plates.  It was difficult to complete tasks such as transferring the balance from the lender, or to register the vehicle.  I did get pulled over for this once--before I knew that traffic violations are classifed as minor misdemeanors.  Sales service was ineffective.  

Honda of Stevens Creek promptly obliged a recent request for records. 

I remain satisfied with the value of the purchase.  My feelings may have been otherwise if I had not observed the missing spare, or elected comprehensive coverage.

Upon further inspection the hoses not easily visable needed replaceing and the brake fluid was very low.  There wasn't even any wiper fluid!  What exactly did theur service department do?

In late July'05 I visited this and 3 other Honda dealerships to buy Odyssey Touring DVD/Nav (fully loaded).  The other 3 dealerships gave me very competitive rates and in a very polite manner. Considering that MSRP was $39010, the best quotes were $37500-$37800 from the other dealerships. 

But the visit to this dealership (Honda of Stevens Creek) was like visiting hell.  Even though the sales person was very polite, the sales manager was not.  And when I tried to walk out, he insisted that I offer him a target price I would like him to meet for the new Odyssey.  So I quoted the best offer I had from another dealer, and he became instantly beligerent and quoted $6000 more than what the other dealers had quoted.  His quote was $44000.  

I told him that this was a very bad joke, considering that MSRP was $39010 and best quotes were $37500-$37800.  At this he made insulting remarks and that he does not have to listen to me.  All this happened after he requested me to not leave and to suggest a price I was looking at for this van.
