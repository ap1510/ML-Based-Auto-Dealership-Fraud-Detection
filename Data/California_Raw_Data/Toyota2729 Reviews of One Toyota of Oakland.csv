0,"October 11, 2019","The worst experience at One Toyota. Brought my 2017 Sequoia in for service and warranty concerns. The vehicle has less than 25000 miles. The drivers leather seat has started to peel apart, shifter knob fake wood grain has rubbed off and the rear seatbelt stopped working. I also had them do an alignment since the vehicle was pulling to the right a little. Service inspection and alignment was down. Inspection came back clear. Everything in good condition especially braking system. The alignment was done and correction was made as well as rotated tires.
They refused to cover some warranty concerns. Said normal wear and tear on the leather seat. I had to contact Toyota warranty myself. As I was on the phone with them they advised me that this is the dealerships responsibility not mine. As I asked to speak with the manager with the Toyota representative on the phone still, I was advised to hang up on the Toyota rep. The foreman was called to the vehicle and was asked by the manager what his opinion was and he said spilled coffee cause the wear on the shift knob. Also the way I sit when I drive is what broke down the leather. Then the foreman changed his mind and said it was the sunscreen I wear that broke down the knob. Excuse after excuse. After getting the run around for a week. The regional Toyota representative contacted me and said they made a decision. The seat will not be warrantied but the knob will. She said it is normal wear and tear on the leather. So I confirmed that it is normal for the quality of leather Toyota uses breaks down quickly. A vehicle that has less than 25000 miles and is 2 years old. She said yes it s not defective but normal. Unbelievable! Luckily they said the knob is covered. The dealership gave me the run around made it difficult to get anything done. The only person that tried and did not lie was my service advisor. The sad part is when I did their survey and was honest about the foreman, overall manage, work done, etc. Which has nothing to do with person to meet first and discuss your car gets dinged because if based on a score of questions and not the comments. This dealership treats its customers poorly. Following the first visit driving the vehicle home when I pressed the brakes the steering wheel began to vibrate back and forth. Never has done that before. So I called one Toyota. They asked me to bring it in to be looked at. They also looked at the rear seatbelt that stopped working. Saying that my kids probably jammed something inside it and that's why it was working. Unreal!!! They cannot force a lie and when they looked at the seatbelt nothing was in it or jammed inside it. So thankfully they are replacing that! I took a video of the steering wheel and asked them what happen. We reviewed the inspection from the week before. Everything was fine and checked out including the road test. On inspection the brakes, rotors, undercarriage was all in good shape. Well today they said I suddenly have hot spots on the rotors and will need them resurfaced and buy new brake pads. 
They would take 50 dollars off though. So a bill around 450. I asked how is this possible. Last week everything was fine. Inspection which I was told is the same one they did again said everything was fine and now today there are hot spots. The vehicle was not doing this prior to them touching my car. One week good inspection, good road test, I am good to go. Now same inspection rotors are bad and need new rotors and brake pads. I placed a phone call into Toyota regional for help. I took the Toyota to Berkeley Toyota and tire pros and asked their opinions. They said the hot spots would and should have been noticed on the first inspection. The vehicle was not driving like this prior to their work and now is. They both agreed I should take it back to one Toyota and have them fix their mistake. I recommend to stay away from one Toyota. Here is the leather and a video of the steering wheel after service at one Toyota",1.0

19,"August 31, 2019","We visited three other Toyota dealerships looking for a specific car, and found it at One Toyota Oakland.  They had a huge inventory, good prices, and generous trade-in on our old car.  We had been told that ""no one"" was discounting the RAV4 Hybrids but One Toyota did.  Their trade-in allowance was higher than what I was offered two years ago on the same old car! Jordant Bernabe helped us make our final decision easy as pie by showing two cars for us to look over and test drive.  Paperwork is always tedious but Jordant got everything done without a huge wait.  We love our new car and can heartily recommend One Toyota of Oakland.",5.0

21,"August 30, 2019","The service crew is very quick, very efficient, and very knowledgeable . They are always able to answer any questions or concerns I may have about anything.",5.0
22,"August 30, 2019","Here is my problem: how is it possible that for a scheduled appointment and a $44 service, one has to wait 4 hours? And this happens repeatedly. How? Everybody on the floor ""seem"" busy, I mean people are really nice there, haven't seen the service shop but judging with how many cars shows up they are busy too. And then when I was leaving, the garage seemed almost empty. So, unless someone explains this to me I'll guess that management is maximizing profits by overbooking in the morning, and certainly over-promising to customers, then pressuring the workers.  This is simply wrong management. What is the point of appointment then?

Btw, I still waited probably 15 minutes once the car was claimed done (10 min since the associate was busy with the other customer, he is working hard, no problem with that), then I had to pay (why not in advance? I agreed to the price already), then I had to wait 5 more minutes for a car to show up. Can't this be streamlined better? Can the car just wait outside? 

And since we are here, bathroom is in a very bad shape (faucets are both leaky to be precise), probably because with so many customers, and 4 hours waiting times for simplest check ups, no wonder it's being used a lot.

I would give 1 star but extra star for employees there. I hope waiting time improves.",2.0

73,"August 10, 2019","I bought my vehicle brand new from this location and get the same vehicle serviced here. There was minor interior damage I noticed after they did some work near that same area of my car. I was told that it was outside interference. I truly feel that someone from Toyota damaged my vehicle and attempted to fix it without reporting it. I feel like my concerns were not taken seriously. I was told that the technician who worked on my car confirmed my vehicle was in that condition upon start of the work and that a technician would not risk losing their job over something so minor. I truly don't believe that. The kicker is they said there was glue as if someone had tried to ""fix"" it. I know I didn't do this and I'm the only one who drive my vehicle. The only time it is out of my possession is when Toyota has had it for service. Nothing about this makes any sense to me. I don't know for sure if it was a technician specifically who may have caused it, bc they aren't the only Toyota employees who are in the car. There are the guys who bring the cars around to the front for pick up as well. The entire situation just seems super suspicious to me. Above all the repair would be over $400 out of my pocket otherwise. I was not very satisfied with the outcome of that visit. The rest of the visits have been above satisfactory.",3.2

Couple of days after I picked up my car, I noticed oil leaking from the rack, I called in and they told me to bring the car in. They inspected the issue and fixed a leaking pipe at no cost. Picked the car but felt the issue was 90% resolved. The steering had a bit of play in it so I brought the can in again. They had the foreman do a test drive with me to inspect it. He momentarily noticed that something is not quite right. It turned out the new rack had an issue, so they ordered a new one and installed in addition to changing the bushing to makes sure the issue is completely gone. Now the drive is perfect and didn't have to pay for the additional work and parts as they empathetic for coming in 3 times for the same thing! I'm glad I took my 4Runnet to One Toyota, honestly they did what is right. Highly recommend",5.0

The dealership is new, clean, and has nice areas to discuss terms, warranties, and such. The only reason they don't get 5 stars is that they were unwilling to adjust the trade in price up $100, so that I would have a break even for what I owed on it.

302,"June 15, 2019","I just bought a used 2015 Prius here 3 days ago. I am a rideshare driver, planning to use this car for that purpose. The car I was originally intending to buy was not as advertised on their website. So I turned to a different option that met the criteria of price, mileage, type (hybrid), and condition.

Like most people, I am not a mechanic. I took the car for the round-the-block test drive, and it seemed okay to my untrained assessor's eye. Or rather, I waited for them to gas up the car first, because there was ZERO GAS IN THE CAR. As in, the range indicator said '0 miles.' THEN, I took it for a test drive and it seemed okay. 

I figured that it would be a fairly good condition, relatively late model car.

So I bought it. Then I took it to Uber for inspection and approval so I could start driving with it.

As you likely already guessed, it failed inspection. The license plate lights were both burned out. They sold me a car that wasn't even street legal.

So I drove right back and talked with Anthony, the guy who sold it to me. I had assumed that they would be mortified at the situation and move me right up to the front of the line in the service department and replace those 2 bulbs immediately so that the car I JUST BOUGHT would be legal to drive.

No such luck. The service advisor told me they were all booked up for the day and that I would have to come back the next day.

Fortunately for me, somebody else came along as I was grumpily walking back to me car to drive away, missing out on a day's worth of driving income because this dealership failed in such a simple task as making sure all the lights work on a car they're selling. He asked me how everything was going, and after I told him, he got me bumped to the front and got the lights fixed.  So that worked out okay in the end. 

The very next day, a headlight went out.  Here it is, day three, and now I am hearing squeaking. Also, the 'Needs Service Soon' light just came on.

These people sold me a car that wasn't street legal when I bought it, had at least one headlight on its last legs, has worn out brake pads, and needs an oil change.

These are not big things for a dealership with an in-house service department to make sure of before they sell a car. Add it into the price and save me the headache of finding these things out afterward and having to deal with them on my own valuable time.

Does any of this seem unreasonable?",2.6

Service was off-the charts amazing. I was greeted instantly by cheerful, authentic staff who knew my name by the 2nd day. Sales associates were very knowledgeable about the product.

The no-haggle pricing was terrific. The user friendly technology - showing pricing, loan rates, etc. on a large screen - was a welcome relief from previous car transactions. I understood the numbers at all times.

Icing on the cake. Special treatment items:

- 24-hour “test drive”!!
- Full tank of gas
- Two year’s maintenance included (manufacturer’s thing?)
- 30-minute post-purchase drive with salesperson to learn car features

We literally went to every Toyota dealer in the south bay, and tried working with each one of them.  And without exception, they all promised one thing, and ultimately delivered nothing.  We even put a deposit down on a promised vehicle at one dealership only to have that opportunity evaporate as well.

Then we got a call from Francisco Portillo at One Toyota of Oakland.  I had been putting multiple requests for my car of interest via the Toyota main site and CarGurus.    I indicated an interest in a car that CarGurus said was available and Francisco was on it like a shot the morning I put in the request.  To make a long story short, within a couple of hours we were driving our new Rav 4.  Red.  Hybrid.  Perfect.  Good deal.  Easy.

502,"April 28, 2019","I live in Merced and was looking for a particular used car.  I had found one online,  in Sacramento, but when I  called to check if it was still available,  it had just sold.

My second choice was a car at One Toyota of Oakland.   I called to check availability and Hector answered.   He said, yes, it was still available as far as the computer said, but he wanted to be sure it was still on the lot and not being driven by someone else.   He called back within minutes,  yes it was still available...when could we come by and test it...we're 2 hours away, plus had to eat lunch,  so, it would be 2 and a half hours.   He was awesome,  said he'd have it ready at 2.

When we arrived a nice gentleman asked if we had spoken to anyone about the car, I said,  ""Yes, but I couldn't remember his name.  It really doesn't matter who I talked to, anyone could sell me the car."" The nice gentleman stopped,  looked me in the eyes and said, ""Oh yes, it matters.  We strive for honesty and integrity here.  We would never take over a sell when someone else had started it!"" 

I was so impressed by that, then I remembered Hector's name and the nice gentleman directed us right to him.

Hector greeted us with a warm smile,  and let us know right away how One Toyota of Oakland works! One price, One person.   No matter who is looking for a car, new or used, there's one price for that car, no haggling,  no need to because they don't overprice their cars!  Also, you'll work with one person from beginning to end. 

He did say they try to get you in and out in an hour and a half, but, we left 2 hours later...the least amount of time I've ever spent in a used car lot.  He didn't try to get me to look at other cars. He didnt try to sell me a lot of things I didnt need.  It was the most awesome buying experience i've ever had.

559,"April 10, 2019","The reason I visited the dealership was to discuss the buyout options for my lease return. I asked repeatedly for this information but ultimately never got it. I felt that the sales people were friendly and helpful but also felt that I was being pushed quite hard towards a new lease or purchase, and feel that this was the goal of the staff there. They presented me with what was a very good deal on a new lease vehicle, which I ended up taking, but after living with the vehicle and using it for my normal driving routine for a couple days, I am not satisfied with what I got. The truck doesn’t get anywhere near the listed mpg, and is not comfortable for an extended period of driving, which wasn’t evident in the brief test drive. 

I contacted the sales person I worked with as well as the sales manager about my concerns, and was told by both that because of California state law I cannot return the vehicle. I was presented with the option of possibility switching to a different lease vehicle, which I am still waiting to hear back about, but I am not hopeful because I’m not sure they have a vehicle on the lot that will suit my needs. This leaves me feeling like I’m probably just going to have to live with this truck that I’m not happy with for the next three years, which is incredibly disappointing. 

I hope some resolution can be found, but again I’m not hopeful, and if I do end up having to keep this truck for the next three years I will likely return it at the end of the lease period and not be a returning Toyota customer. 

In retrospect, I wish I had just switched my previous vehicle to financing and kept it rather than getting into, and now ultimately stuck with something I’m not satisfied with. ",3.4

I arranged my own Uber and waited for it under the tent outside the service department. A service department employee was there and did not ask whether I was waiting for a ride. (Something they had done in pst occasions) I concluthat rides were no longer being offered. When I returned I noticed that other clients were being dropped off by Lyft. I concluded that I just did not qualify because of the price of the service. When I got a text from the service advisor, I replied that the service was not exceptional. We exchanged text messages where Jim attempted to make amends. I wrote that ten dollars off the next service would work. Didn’t hear any more(yes or no).

In the past at this location, the survey seemed to be the most important thing with “anything less than a 5 star is considered a failure”.  Thus, my 5 star review because I wasn’t guilted into it.   Thanks Chase. ",5.0

635,"March 17, 2019","Chase is the man.  We went to another dealer to get a repair done on a newly purchased Toyota.  They were uncertain and left us confused as to why we even purchased the car from them.  When we pulled into to Toyota One and met Chase he was on the ball and new in minutes what to do vs the half hour we spent else where.   We need the repair done in a timely fashion and at a certain price-at the end Chase had the car mirror done within our time frame and cost almost half as much as the other dealer because he was able to use parts that were not damaged.  What Chase did not know is we need to purchase another car/SUV in the near future and earned our business for  this up coming purchase as well.

684,"March 09, 2019","I purchased my Tacoma in NH, drove it across to CA and a few weeks later set up my first 5,000 mile service.
I had purchased 2 Toyota’s in my time in NH because their service IS AWESOME!
When i got in my truck to drive in to One Toyota of Oakland i found water was leaking down both seatbelts! My first thought was “crap!” And then my immediate second thoughts were “it’s cool, i have the all inclusive and extended warranties, i’ll just leave it with them”.
I arrived at the dealership and John assessed the problem. He brought over Tony (Service Manager) and they began to explain that a water leak may not be covered under warranty.
Little did the team know i’d just recently had a really tough weekend personally and that morning wasn’t turning out good either, so unfortunately they took the brunt of my frustrations. Guys I apologize!
It’s a brand new truck and in my mind there’s no way this should be happening or my fault!
Tony was excellent! He took a moment to come back out again and see me and said to me “Jonathan, i’m here to help you but i’ll always be honest too. I’ll make sure i do everything I can to have you taken care of, don’t stress, we’ll do our best for you”.
I’d come from what had always been a perfect experience at Rockingham Toyota in NH to a potential disaster of non warranteed damages.
TONY AND THE TEAM CAME THROUGH IN FINE FORM!!!!
They put me in to a rental for free. What was going to be a one day displacement turned in to a 3 - 4 day but they covered everything and kept in communication daily.
It turned out that the roof rack installed by the NH team was not fully water tight and in the rainstorm it leaked.
Tony and his team worked it out with the NH team and they covered the repairs and damages.
I cannot say THANK YOU enough!!! 
I had gone from a high stress situation to Tony keeping his word, collaborating with a dealer on the opposite side of the country and truly helping me. 
THANK YOU TO ALL OF THE TEAM INVOLVED!!!

Also the option to have a Lyft ride round trip is extremely convienent (although I did not take advantage of it). I give only 3 stars because it took 2 hours for a 10k check up even with an appointment & they did not reset the maintenance alert that comes up in my car (so it is still saying maintenance required every time I turn on the car). In addition I noticed my car was parked & ready, I waited 10 minutes and then went to find a service representative myself.

The sales manager Luis emailed me back and we discussed the van before I was going to make the almost hour drive with my one year old. I emailed about an 8 passenger van and asked if it had the bluray video system and he said it did. So I let him know I was going to come out to look at the van. Well it took an hour and half to get to the dealership with traffic and come to find out the van I emailed on did not have the bluray player as the sales manager stated. I then asked to speak with him again and he was unsympathetic to us and did not even try to help the situation. I am so disappointed that I wasted a day to look at a vehicle from this dealership when I made sure to ask the questions I had before hand. Also, disgusted with how we were treated by the sales manager.",1.4

I only wish you could still provide complimentary car washes, but other than that my experience was great. Kudos to James for going above and beyond to make sure I was happy.  ",4.8
779,"February 24, 2019","It's been a good long while since I took my car here. I used to think it was worth the extra price for an oil change because of the free car wash. I was pretty bummed to find it was no longer offered and even more off-putting was the sign that claimed it was to be more green and eco friendly when I'm sure it was more about saving money. I don't disagree that it was probably wasteful to have every single car washed whether it needed it or not. But at least have a low cost option for those who still want it and it would likely still cut down significantly on the number of requests. Also, every time I come in thet reccomend a crazy long list of service and not much help determining what is really necessary and what is just on the list. Also, prices for many of these services are $$$. While I understand you probably have a highly trained and certified techs it's just not worth it for me to pay that much for simple routine maintenence. The people working here are friendly, courteous, and professional and the overall experience is great. I just cannot justify the price. You get what you pay for, and they really seem to provide top quality service. I'm just too cheap and as petty as it may seem the lack of free car wash is a deal breaker for me. ",4.0

1068,"January 15, 2019","We have not had one experience with the repair department that has gone well. We’ve had 4 repairs that comes to mind. One was a recall on excessive old consumption: it took around 7 months to get the car back from you, and the consumption issue was made worse in the end. Our suspensioin tower needed replacement: first repair failed & took 10 months to resolve issue. It’s fine now. Hybrid battery module went bad: repair department estimated a $7000.00 repair cost was needed. I fixed the problem with a $35.00 module part. It’s been fine so far after more than 1 1/2 years. My latest repair issue took three times to get right (2 bad tire pressure sensors): I had all four replaced, and one newly installed sensor went bad before I even got the car home. It took two visits to get it resolved. Then afterwards, repair department left 3 out of 4 valve covers off, off of my new sensors. Also they overfilled spare tire for some reason. I shouldn’t have to go out and re-buy replacements on my new tire valves/ sensors. Ultimately, I haven’t had a successful repair at Toyota One. You are really only effective for oil changes, and regular mainainence. I don’t plan on having repairs at your facility in the future, nor can I recommend you to others with Toyotas. I will be back for routine mainainence only. Other issues I have with Toyota One is the overuse and abuse of our phone text service. I had received a text from someone in your finance department named Pablo, who texted all of our registered phone numbers, and who was trying to encourage me to trade in my car for a new one. I found that completely inappropriate and distateful. Conversely, your service representatives are nice, and good with keeping up with me while our cars are being serviced. That is the one thing I appreciate. ",3.2

James came out, with a patient and calming stature and immediately started to take care of us. We showed him the problem, and his mind started to race through the possibilities, landing on it having to do with something with the brakes, hopefully. Though there was no available appoints left that day, he insured we would be taken first thing in the morning, and got us set up with a rental for the night. He told he would call by 10 the next day with an update.

9:45 he calls, with an update that there was a rock in behind our break pad, and that the car is ready and has even had the recall fixed. He got us out of there just in time for us to continue our original plans with my visiting parents, as if the car was never broken.

James Kim was amazing. He helped my visiting parents continue to have a nice time. He helped us quickly and efficiently take care of the problem with our car. And the entire time he was kind, kept our spirits up, and was very genuine. We can’t thank you enough. It is people like James that has kept us coming back to This toyota dealership for almost 4 years now.

The guy who ended up being my customer service agent told me my tire was flat after glancing at the car for a second. Having just drove there, and being followed by my wife who was my ride, she did not observe any flat tire. But as I was talking to the agent, a lot of mechanics were walking by my car. And then when he told me to go look at my “flat”. I did see that all the air was almost gone and it did look flat...needless to say I was suspicious especially after he acted like I was stupid for not noticing that my tire was “flat”.
My car took 3 hours for an oil change and flat repair. Seems long for me. I was late for a haircut appt because of this. 
And when I came to pick it up, no one could find the agent to close out the invoice. I stood in the service department for 20 minutes waiting for my agent to come and close the invoice while he was paged incessantly and his phone was not even on him! It was sitting on his desk!

I had an appointment at 9:15 and was early. 2 Cars that were behind were taken before me. and then still had to wait another 20 mins before a tech assisted me. I went in for an oil change and was asked when I wanted my car back. I said 1pm. My tech, James said ok. Although my requested time was not noted on my paperwork. I called around 1:40 since I haven't heard from my tech and James was not available. I spoke to receptionist and was told my car wasnt ready and wouldn't be ready for another hour or so. James called about a little after that to say my car was ready but my brakes needed maintenance. I called him back and asked why I'm just now being told when they have had my car for 4 hours and could have completed the work. In the past this would have happened. I would have gotten a call from my tech within an hour of dropping off saying they found some items that needed maintenance and would I like that taken care of. 
James mentioned that he was in meetings and was able to give me a call about this. Quite honestly, this establishment has gone down hill. The maintenance tech service is horrible and I will not be returning to service my car here anymore nor will I recommend this place.

1589,"October 31, 2018","I took my truck in for a recall on the blower motor and a couple weeks later there was a problem with my engine. The check engine light came on and it started rumbling. Took it back in and found that there were metal shavings that got inside. It took a few days for them to flush it out. Not even a month after i got my truck back, same problem started happening. However, this time when i took my truck in, they said they ran the diagnostic test and no reading showed up. So i’m not really sure if they did or are able to erase any history from when the check engine light came on or not. Either way im not too happy that my truck now has a problem that i am not sure is completely resolve or will give me a headache in the future.",2.8

James at check in was rude and unhelpful, left me to find someone else to help me get checked in. He was aggressive, confrontational & nonsensical. Not a good resoresentstion for Toyota. I’ve had my car for 10 years and he’s by far the worst in customer service Ive experiences. I had to find someone else to check me in & was bounced back & forth to each side of the service areas in the process. Diana was also condescending & unprofessional as well when I finally got checked in & I asked which side of the service areas should I sit and wait in. They expect customers to know how to navigate their internal processes without explanation. All the staff thought it was funny, except Denny- he was respectful. Another customer was complaining of similar treatment while I was standing at the desk. I offered the manager feedback & little was done to resolve other than giving me her business card. She may be the root of the issue, not sure. Very unorganized and poorly run service area. Customers over pay on service from dealerships to receive higher quality. I can’t say quality is high here any more.",1.6

I didn't feel pressured at all. I came in selected the car that I wanted and my sales person Alex was very patient and showed me the car and we took it out for a test drive. We than sat down and did all the paperwork and he explained all the optional features and plans that I could get if I wanted to. Nothing was forced on me and he did not say that I needed something that I didn't. 

I remember when I was younger going with my dad to other dealers in the area and we would be attacked by pushy sales persons and their managers trying everything in their power to get him to buy a car from them. 

I also want to mention that Alex drove my old car home and I followed him in the new one. THAT IS SO COOL. I didn't have to figure out how to get back to come to get my Prius.

I would have to say that the last visit was not up to par.  

Apparently, a few visits ago the advisor documented the wrong work that was done on my truck.  He documented that my rear brakes were replaced.  When I came back less than 10,000 miles later my rear brakes were at less than 2 mm and it was advised that I get them replaced again. The advisor at that time could not figure out why it had worn out so fast.  So he recommended that I come back and talk with a manager and even gave me the idea that they would fix it at no cost or at least a discount.  So I came back and they recommended do a more thorough brake inspection.   I agreed and they found nothing wrong.  Ultimately,  they offered no deal for the mistake that they had made and I had to pay full price to get the brakes replaced.

1819,"September 29, 2018",I had our Toyota Prius (2004) serviced with essentially the ‘60000 mile’ package. The service manager Ray allowed me to remove the service items that I had done recently by a tire company thus reducing the price and servicing only what the car required.

1820,"September 29, 2018","This service center is always too busy.  They’ve improved in a few areas in terms having someone checking people in before you pull into the garage, using Uber and free loaner cars.  Chase the service manager was very helpful and cheerful.  You can tell he cares about what he does. I brought my car in for a recall and the service was complete in about 4 hours.  Those are all of the good parts.  Took too long to deal with cashiers who also rent out the free cars.  I should be able to return the car to the service manager at the same time I’m checking out with him.  I almost missed pickup of my 4 year old because this process took too long and then never got any kind of an update on the actual service because I just needed to sign the paper and leave.  Then when they brought my car around I was handed a key hat no longer had my house key on it.  Asked the guy who brought the car around and he didn’t know where it was and told me to ask Chase.  Chase didn’t know either but said he would said out an email immediately. As I was going back to my car, because I had to leave to pick up my son, the guy who had delivered the car came around the corner and said he gave me the wrong keys and proceeded to give me the right keys. In addition when I first got in the car, the entire car smelled like cigarettes and I do not smoke.  I mentioned this to Chase when I asked about the key.  He apologized and said that he would have the car detailed. I have yet to hear anything about that offer.",4.0

1943,"September 09, 2018","A few years ago we had a very bad experience at One Toyota when looking for our new Sienna van. We ended up at another dealership further from home and got a better deal with none of the typical auto dealer B.S. involved in the car buying experience. Very soon after buying the van, we had a failure in the BSM system and brought it to One Toyota for warranty service and were told it would cost over $1000 to fix. We took it to the dealership that sold it to us and they said it was a warranty issue and fixed it for free. From then on, we only took the van to One Toyota for prepaid maintenance issues. Recently I blew a tire on Heggenberger within a mile on One Toyota and so asked to be towed there since maintenance was also due.
Here's where our attitude shifted, thanks to our service advisor, Chase.  He was able to get us a very fair prorated discount on a set of Michelins that should have lasted 60,000 miles but only made it to 29,000. Additionally, new front end  struts were put on under warranty.  Chase was also very available for questions  and also really new his stuff when we asked questions about our 30 year old Land Cruiser which we also brought in the next day to be looked at.  The only reason we brought the Land Cruiser in to One Toyota instead of the usual place was because of Chase and how accommodating and knowledgeable he is. Also a really nice guy.  
So, not sure what had changed to make One Toyota a place to return to and encourage recommendations to others, but please don't change! And give Chase a raise😁.",5.0

However, I'm still so pissed at your service department I'm going to keep at it and go ahead with this much condensed version:

 Please, One Toyota, get your xxxx together with servicing foreign cars. I know I'm the xxxxing black sheep or something with my Mercedes, but if it's too hard to do the xxxx right, why for God's sake would you offer to sell me the service contract in the first place? After this many xxxx ups, I'm about ready to just do it all myself. Christ. 

I'll keep this short and sweet. Your guys really xxxxed me this time. I could handle dropping the $40 on the 3 quarts of oil your guys ""neglected"" to put back in my engine a few appointments ago, and I can handle the 12lbs of air pressure over the specs your guys put in my tires and then had the audacity to xxxxing lie about. ""they're at 28 on the front and 32 in the back"" he said. Oh, why are all four at 40 then? Yeah, that's not a huge pain the xxx... 

 What really drives me off the xxxxing wall is why someone set my light settings from ""auto"" to ""only the driver side parking lights on all the time"" and then never set it back. What the xxxx does that have to do with a normal service? Why the xxxx did they touch the lights at all. Why the xxxx didn't they say anything. Now, I'm the xxxxing idiot because I didn't notice until my roommate let me know the xxxxing driver side parking lights were on, and my xxxxing battery is now too low to start the car. Now I have to wrangle up a xxxxxxx battery charger and get it to my house without my xxxxing vehicle, out of pocket, because I can't just jumpstart the xxxxing thing without risking damage to the xxxxing electronics. I'm not trying to get any handouts from you or even a xxxxing penny of reimbursement, but this xxxx up is on you and I'll remember it. 

Get your xxxx together.

We even have a friend who works with car dealerships all over the Bay Area who thought he would be able to help us secure a great deal with another dealership by bargaining. When we told our friend what the quoted price was from One Toyota, he was amazed and told us we should buy it because we wouldn’t get a better deal anywhere else.

We also love the fact that you work with only one person instead of a sales rep and then finance rep. Ryan was incredibly knowledgeable in both the sales and financial piece.

2103,"August 18, 2018","Overall I was very pleased with the service from the dealership, and I will definitely bring the car back for service.  Some things that I really appreciate -
1.)  Great personalities all around.  Upon meeting/speaking with Chase and some of his co-workers I became immediately comfortable in our interactions.  Sending your car into a black hole of maintenance can be stressful sometimes (how much is this going to cost, how long is it going to take, is there anything major, are they going to treat me like an idiot, etc.), just like a doctor's office.  When everybody is just great to talk to it can ease any upfront tensions and start the process off on the right note by establishing a good rapport.  And it wasn't the ""I'm smiling because I'm paid too"" smile either, as everyone I interacted with was genuinely friendly.
2.) Listen to their customers.  I understand that they deal with a lot of people and some problems/complaints can be redundant, but I had the feeling that they treat everybody on an individual basis, as in I'm not being judged by their past experiences.  Instead of just running my car through the assembly line, Chase found out my car's purpose for me: commuting to work and putting high mileage on it.  Once knowing this, he was able to cater to my particular situation, such as giving me high mileage tires or specific inspections that might weed out any degradation.  
  [This is the main reason I stopped going to Broadway Toyota as I had a bad experience with a tech on the phone, who was giving me no help/solution to diagnose why my OBDII Smog Drive Cycles wouldn't clear.  He kept telling me that the mechanics are just going to tell me to drive more miles, even though I drove >1000 miles already including drive times within the specified speed ranges.  I took it to a smog shop and they found the problem with a sensor in an hour.  This being a converse example of a tech not understanding my situation, running me through the process, and ultimately not helping me resolve my issue.  Unless he was correct and Toyota cannot diagnose their own cars' sensor failures.]
2.) Texting me updates.  This was really useful as I don't always have time to talk when I'm at work, but I can always check and respond to a text when I get the time.  Also I remember trying to write down prices and details whenever I talked with a mechanic, but with the texting everything is archived and I can refer to it.  Plus with texting I feel like I get more frequent updates because it's easy to just shoot someone a text real quick.
3.) Up front about everything.  I appreciate it when they tell me what's broken, what needs to be fixed, what may need to be fixed, and how much it's going to cost.  No embellishments, this is the what it is, it's data.
4.) Solved my problems with a rental car.  This was an unexpected surprise because I was assuming that I was going to rent a car down the street by the airport.  But this made everything so streamlined.  I didn't have to worry about an extra day be needed for the service, then calling up Avis to extend a rental.  It was just all inclusive.

This was a great experience, and I feel they're doing everything right and have the correct philosophy.  ",5.0

I dont know how, but i got behind the wheel i tried it out and just loved it! 
We were still waiting for a check from insurance to be cleared but wanted the car asap and dodnt want it to be sold to someone else... bc suggested that toyota can cash out our check not today, but week after, just right after we get money on the account from insurance for my dead prius.

2391,"July 08, 2018","I was in the market for a new Toyota Rav4 Hybrid. I had signed up for TrueCar, and visited another Toyota dealership to see the vehicle I had spec'ed out on TrueCar. I was shown an entirely different vehicle (a fully equipped top of hte line Limited). The rest of my experience went down hill from there. I shook the sales rep's hand, told him I would think about it, and left. i thought for about 5 sec, and knew that I would never even give those people a second glance. 

I dropped by OneToyota of Oakland, and also received the usual song and dance about how they offer the lowest no haggle price, that they do not participate in TrueCar, Costco, or other buying programs because they offer such low prices, and all of the other verbiage one hears at car dealerships. I was clear that I was not in a mood to be trifled with and that they really needed to impress me. 

Long story short, they did impress me -- completely and totally. They did offer exceptionally low prices, and on a vehicle that better met my needs than I had originally spec'ed out. They really did give me a VERY good deal on my trade in. They were completely open about my purchase options and incentives. There was NO pressure purchase an extended warranty plan or gap insurance, or any of the myriad other such items. There was no haggling and offers and counter offers. It was simply a very simple and straight forward process. 

And, the sales rep with whom I worked, was excellent. Professional, very friendly, worked with me very well, laughed at my lame-assed jokes. I won't say that I enjoyed the process, but it was so much easier than it could have been. I rate Michael Han 5 stars, and Kenny Prunetti  4, only because I had limited contact with him. 

Without question, when I do have to purchase a new vehicle, I will be going back to OneToyota. And, without question, I will recommend OneToyota to any friend of mine who is looking for a new vehicle.

I was then greeted by a service associate who adamantly explained that I could not use the “free car wash and tire rotation” coupons that I reveived in the mail from Toyota1 of Oakland because for one apparently Toyota “just sends them out with their name on it & they haven’t provided the car washing service for 2 years, and it would take hours for it to get done because they didn’t have a specific person to do it”. I didn’t feel like arguing so I left it alone even though that made absolutely no sense to me. I made me appointment for 9:30am and came in even earlier to drop it off, I then called around 12:30 to see if there was any update on the status of my car. I was told it hadn’t even been looked at yet and that he didn’t have any idea as to when it would be or how long it would take. A few more hours went by and it was about 3pm with still no word on the status of my car. No progress was made until my mother finally called to speak with someone because at the time he was unavailable, and she was confused as to why it was taking so long. I didn’t receive any word about my car until about 30 minutes after my mom spoke to a service manager, just to find out the issue the whole time was essentially a loose gas cover. When I came to pick my car up, I’m not sure who I spoke to but I wanted clarification on the car wash policy and he explained to me the same thing the other gentlemen did about how they no longer offer it anymore, but once he saw my coupon and that it was from their establishment he very kindly honored it.

2551,"June 18, 2018","I'd been thinking about selling my Japanese Muscle, a Subaru WRX Sti. I've enjoyed driving it, however with a manual transmission I am literally ""rowing the clutch"" in traffic. I wanted something still ""sport life,"" and decided on a mid-sized truck. A Toyota Tacoma SR5, Dbl-cab w/a short bed. No base model. It had to be loaded. 

I looked at a nice 2018 used truck with low miles at Coliseum Lexus. The asking price was a bit high for a used vehicle. While the salesperson was nice, he couldn't tell me how much I'd get for my car as a trade-in. Just gave me a range. With a bit of homework, I knew what would be fair. I thanked him and said I was going down the block to One Toyota. The guy remarked I would have to pay about the same. I said I could get a new truck for a few thousand more. The salesman balked at me. 

Rolled up to the Toyota dealership and was greeted by a charming woman. She asked what I was in the market for and introduced me to Ryan. 

This guy was courteous and showed me a similar used truck. It was lower in price, but not really equipped with what I was looking for. Ryan showed me a new  SR5 2018 loaded. 

Ryan took me back to the office and on a display showed me the total price of the new truck and the price I would get for my car as a trade-in. It was $6 K more than Lexus offered me. A closer look revealed Lexus offered me the auto auction value! According to the Kelley Blue Book and Toyota, my car was rated in good condition! I got top dollar for my car. 
. 
Ryan was professional and worked out a fantastic deal. I purchased a new whip for less than the same used truck and received a great trade-in for my car, plus rebate money. He was THE ONLY PERSON I worked with. No back in forth with a sales manager crap! Ryan handled the financing himself and shared with me every detail. He didn't try to over sell me with service contracts and junk.

Once I’d made up my mind and came back to buy it was Danny’s day off and Nicole completed the sale quickly with full explanations at every step of the way.

In the end, my parents were very satisfied as were we because they found a vehicle that fit their budget and drove home HAPPY. 

I would never hesitate to recommend One Toyota because they have managed to continue raising the bar. 

Thank you Eduardo and thank you One Toyota!",5.0

2679,"November 29, 2017",There was none of the typical BS found at most dealerships.  I’m used to 5 or 6 wasted visits from the floor boss and a an hour long follow-up with the finance guy trying to sell plastic mats and overpriced warranties.  One Toyota has none of those behaviors. I worked with one really good person (Nic Nunes) and was out quickly with what I wanted. Give them and Nic the business: other dealers should be like this.

In January 2017, we visited One Toyota to start looking at larger vehicles because we learned that we were expecting a set of twins and we have an 8 year old daughter. We had narrowed down our search to a Toyota Highlander and an Acura MDX. We were met by Ainsworth Leslie, who helped us purchase our Prius and he introduced us to Wesley Harris. We were very clear from the beginning we were not ready to purchase anything because we were in a high risk pregnancy and did not want to undertake another unnecessary car payment yet. They were very understanding to our circumstances.  Over the next few months, per our request, Wesley and Leslie both communicated with us by phone, text, and email letting us know what deals were happening that could benefit us financially without EVER making us feel pressured to buy. They went above and beyond, even checking in on the health of our pregnancy. We purchased our 2017 Toyota Highlander in April 2017 and absolutely love it. It is now September 2017, and I still feel as happy and excited about working with Wesley and my Highlander as I did in April. We had a phenomenally streamlined buying experience. We were in and out in 1 hour, which is unheard of! Wesley was a dream to work with! We had a few upgrades that needed to be installed after purchase and Wesley made sure to facilitate installation, even stepping in when we had issues with the service department finding our parts. Wesley and Leslie went above and beyond and even checked in on the health of our pregnancy, both before and after we purchased our car. I have come to expect great service from One Toyota but what I continually  get is EXTRAORDINARY and PHENOMENAL service.

2710,"July 27, 2017","This Dealership is completely incompetent. I am completely appalled at their service and wonder how they stay in business by treating their customers so badly!  After receiving a notice months ago from Toyota that my airbags had been recalled, and ""not to use the front passenger seat."" Then in June I received a notice that I could finally get this replaced.  I called to Dealership to make the appointment, reviewed my VIN and contact information with them to get the airbags changed.  Being that they are so busy it takes a month to get an appointment. One day prior to the appointment, I received 2 phone calls verifying the appointment and what the appointment was for and to confirm I would be there.  To get there on time, I get up at 4:30am and was told they could not be fixed the airbags because they have to order the parts and that takes a few days to receive.  If you know I was coming in for the appointment to fix the airbags that were recalled, why would you not have ordered the parts so they are ready? There was a month of time between when I made the appointment and the actual day of the appointment. Why would you call 2 times in one day to confirm the appointment when you did not order the parts for the appointment in the first place?  How completely incompetent can this Dealership be?  When I asked why the Customer Service was so bad, I was told that his customer service was good and it was everyone else that had problems.  I had to remind the man that when you work for Toyota and you wear the logo on your Shirt and jacket, you represent Toyota as a whole.  Toyota is a team and when there is a failure in falls on everyone, you do not get to be the star while all other employees are incompetent, you are a team and the failure on the team is a direct reflection on all Toyota employees.

2718,"April 11, 2017","Everyone seems to have a car dealership nightmare story. I'd like to put something out there to illustrate that not all car dealers are created the same. 

First, my Toyota Avalon was parked where a San Francisco water main broke, due to heavy rains of early 2017. Unfortunately, my vehicle flooded. My insurance company declared it as a total loss, even though the water never reached the seats, and electronically it was intact. One Toyota stepped in, fought with the insurance adjusters, and attempted to salvage my water-damaged Avalon. I loved that car and wanted to keep it. 

However, the damage from the flood involved not a lot of repairs but did involve a great deal of labor time. Brandon worked so hard bringing the cost of repairs down to the minimum they could ask, but It was still totaled out. 

Brandon Feola, a service advisor at One Toyota since 2015, stepped in and helped me negotiate with the insurance adjusters, which took a great deal of documentation and time. Brandon Feola and One Toyota worked on my claim for three months, back and forth with the insurance company. Brandon's advocacy and documentation was the determining factor for me to receive the best possible settlement. 

One Toyota went far above the call of duty. 
So ended this THREE MONTH nightmare, which also included a borrowed car being vandalized at my work in Oakland. All the windows were bashed out. The whole scenario was surreal, and nothing got done until One Toyota stepped up and heavily advocated in my behalf.

I spent a lot of money on the Avalon and maintained it flawlessly. I didn't have the money to put into an equivalent vehicle. However, Nicole and Darrien Lien of One Toyota found me a one-year-old loaded Toyota XLE, and at a phenomenal price. They made the process of replacing my vehicle so much easier for me. To say they were patient was an understatement. The process of buying a new car went on for three days, many tears and emotionally laden. I refused to go to another dealer to purchase a car. Brandon's work was commendable, and I am loyal to this dealership.

Nicole and Darrien worked tirelessly with me, on one day staying over an-hour-and-a-half after closing, while I tried to make a decision (I couldn't). But like a good parent, they stood by, informing and guiding me without assertiveness or frustration. Now I'm in love with my XLE.

I owe that entire dealership a great deal. They are consummate professionals, courteous and genuine. They helped me get results when my own efforts were insufficient. 

Thank you, One Toyota and Ainsworth Leslie who heads the team, for your patience, diligence, and stellar customer service. I highly recommend them, especially for women on their own, who have apprehension with automotive services and/or purchases.

I will add that for certified vehicles, they are the #1 dealer in the Bay Area. They rank highest among NorCal Toyota dealers on Yelp as well. And my saga is proof.

Recommend action: 

1. During winter season, One Toyota of Oakland should provide a portable heater for the employee(s) checking in vehicles as they come in for scheduled appointments. Taking care of employees should be the #1 priority as they take care of customers. Employees are they reason why we customers continue to return.

2. I purchased the ToyotaCare Plus and received my welcome packet in the mail with various coupons. I understand that California has had months with water restrictions due to no rain. We have had rain from January 2017 to present but we still are advise to conserve our water usage. As a major company like One Toyota of Oakland, I highly recommend the company intall a car wash system that recycles water just like the ones are being used around the Bay Area. Why provided coupons to customers in their ToyotaCare Plus packet and customers are unable to use them? If this particular One Toyota of Oakland does to provide complimentary car wash for their customer when coupon is provided then an alternative free service should be provided to the customer.",5.0

If you're looking for a new or used car... this is the place to go. I chose to drive all the way to Oakland (an hour away!) because of the price/and customer service when I had a Toyota place less than 15 minutes from where I live.

Ask for Derek Laubach he's makes the process pain free.",5.0

I was having my car serviced and everything was thoroughly explained to me.  I was treated  with respect and care -rare in these days.

2725,"May 21, 2016","My salesperson, Leslie Ainsworth, was fantastic. 
I own a dog walking company and needed to trade in my 2015 CRV ""clean car"" for a ""more suitable to walk dogs in""  car. I ended up buying a used (Toyota certified) 2014 Toyota Siena with 14K miles that had been a lease. I was originally looking for a truck, but in talking to Leslie about the range of dogs I walk, I realized the lower/more accessible height was important for older/less able-bodied dogs and still great for the young and vibrant pups. One week in using it as my dog walking mobile and I can say the Siena is a great fit.

Leslie was way better than any car salesperson I have worked with and I have worked with many (In my 11 years in business I have bought 5 cars total and I own 3 cars now--I bought the other 4 from Oakland Honda and Oakland Toyta ). Leslie was easy going but very informative and more thorough than any other car salesperson I have worked with. I think he told me he's been working for this dealership for 23 years in several capacities. He really knows Toyotas inside and out and a lot about the competition, too. 

This is a great dealership and if you can work with Leslie you're in very good hands. Thumbs up!",5.0
2726,"February 20, 2016","It is an amazing feeling to honestly say my fiancé and I had the best car purchasing experience.   I recently accepted a job, which requires commuting at least 85 miles per day.  I had a 2013 Toyota Corolla, also purchased from One Toyota and during our servicing had heard they rented cars.  So, we were actually just looking to rent a Toyota Prius to get a feel for it and see if it was an option.  Unfortunately, there were no Prius' to rent and since we were already there decided to go look at the Prius' on the lot.  Within minutes we were approached and asked if we needed assistance or had any questions.  We informed them we had intended to rent however, they were sold out and we were just looking.  At this point, we were told about the possibility of 'borrowing' a car and were introduced to Ainsworth Leslie, who goes by Leslie.  Leslie was very friendly and brought a calm laid back demeanor.  He explained the process of borrowing a car and told us we should go on a test drive because the Prius was not operated like other cars and he wanted to show us a few things.  While filling out the paperwork, Leslie asked us if it would be okay to get our 6-year-old daughter a cookie.  He asked us discreetly, and not in front of her, which was a major plus.  We went on a test drive and the car immediately impressed me even though the features would take a little getting used to.  Upon returning to the dealership we asked Leslie if he could run the some numbers in regards to trading in our Corolla and what our new payments looked like.  Leslie appraised our car very quickly and was able to tell us the difference in payments.  He even took the time to look at gas comparisons between the Prius and Corolla because he knew that was our primary concern.  It turns out that our Corolla had over $2000 equity that could be used as a down payment.  Additionally, the President’s day special was no monthly payments for 3 months.  My fiancé and I talked it over and decided to go ahead a purchase the car.  Never, not once did Leslie ever ask us if we wanted to purchase the car or push us in that direction.  Because we were not intending to purchase a car we had our 6 year old with us.  Anyone with kids knows there is no way you would bring a child, considering how long it takes to process the paperwork.  Leslie was prepared for this as well.  Out of his personal bag from home, he pulls out crayons and paper for her to draw (because he has children, one of which is our daughters age).   When our daughter complains she is hungry as kids often do, he had some Cheez-its waiting for her, with our approval of course.  He even gave her special tasks to help, like bringing us the keys and having her show us special features in the car.  He is most definitely the best car salesman I have ever met, but more importantly is a very kind, caring, professional and amazing man.  Thank you Leslie and One Toyota for your amazing service!",5.0

2728,"December 09, 2013",Purchased 2 trucks in 2 months. First truck was scratched in the service department on a warranty repair of a new truck. Second truck was a more expensive incorrect model then we had discussed. The dealership refused to work with me on the price even though the price mistakes where all theirs. One Toyota initially refused to remove and replace a lock that they placed on the spare tire. This is why I have rated the dealer  so poorly. ,1.4
