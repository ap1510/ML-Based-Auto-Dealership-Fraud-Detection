0,"February 24, 2020","My wife and I purchased a 2017 used Certified Pre-Owned LX 570 sight unseen. We were moving from Hawaii to Albuquerque, NM and needed a car to drive our family from CA to NM when we landed. Because of the reputation Lexus and Lexus Certified Pre-Owned vehicles have, we purchased it sight unseen. We landed in CA got a ride from a family member to the Lexus dealership to pick up our new vehicle. Literally walked around the vehicle for one minute, went in and signed papers. Moments later drove it across country. When we got to NM I had to wash the vehicle and this is when the issues arouse. The car had significant repairs to both back and front bumpers (never disclosed). Whoever covered up the issues used a slightly off colored paint, painted over the parking sensors, over spray on the taillights, mud flaps, and luggage protectors. The texture is horrible, when you get underneath the car you can see paint drips from excessive paint. On the front of the car, the same exact issues, paint over the parking sensors, paint on the accent lights and a cracked grill. Lexus of Santa Monica refuses to make this right. They will not cover any of the costs to get it corrected, rather they want me to drive to CA and maybe they will take care of it. I am stuck fitting the bill for something that Lexus should have corrected immediately.

This is just the beginning, the windshield wipers were not adjusted correctly and were hotting the windshield pillar, there are massive transmission issues that have creeped up, and the tailgate does not lift automatically. Yes these items can be corrected over warranty, but the underlying story is that the Service Department did not do their jobs or did them extremely poorly. 

Worst dealership I have ever been to, never never go here.",1.0
1,"January 13, 2020","Enrique Carvajal has helped me get into 2 Lexus vehicles. My first one was a 2019 ES 300h which I loved. Enrique was there to help me anytime I had a car emergency. Unfortunately after only 7 months of driving the car, I found it with a tree crashed onto it. It totaled the vehicle. In a state of panic I called Enrique asking if he could get me into another Lexus. He had always been so helpful and generous that I knew I wanted to work with him again. At first I couldn’t get into a car I wanted for the price I wanted but he kept working with me until I found the perfect car for an amazing price. I now have a beautiful black UX 250h. I know I can always count on Enrique with my car and I definitely advice going into Lexus and requesting his name. ",5.0
2,"December 25, 2019","Richard Doherty is a pleasure to work with.  He goes the extra mile to take care of me which is one of the main reasons I go directly to Lexus for my services when clearly I could get it for a lot cheaper at a third party vendor.  It’s all about the service including the convenience of a loaner car. You get what you pay for.  My only complaint about Lexus is that their bumpers are the absolute worst.  The brackets are so flimsy that the bumper repeatedly gets misaligned when your bumper scrapes the driveway or curb.  This and this reason alone is why I will never buy another Lexus.  So until this 10 year old car dies on me, I will continue going to their service center.  Considering how dependable Lexuses are, it will probably be another decade before I switch to another make/model.",5.0

54,"October 20, 2019","We visited the service department for the first time on October 18, 2019. We purchased a 2018 CPO vehicle 6 months ago, and we were bringing it in for service. We were promptly greeted by service representative Arsany Kamel. He made the experience pleasant and smooth. Mr. Kamel ordered a LYFT ride for my husband, as he had a doctor's visit nearby. I was happy to wait in the service area, surrounded by comfortable chairs, water, tea, and chocolate chip cookies. Mr. Kamel checked in on me before his lunch break and advised me to speak to another representative when my husband needed a return ride. The return ride was arranged by another very pleasant representative.  I appreciated Mr. Kamel's helpful courtesy. Since we have only driven @ 2,000 miles in the car, the standard minor service was fine. 
My only minor grumble is that the loud noise of the television was an annoyance. Perhaps placing the television on Mute or piping in soothing, beautiful classical music (note, not opera!) would add to the pleasant, luxurious ambiance. The car was ready in @ 2.5 hours, and I was grateful for the complimentary car wash. Once again, a pleasant service experience.",5.0

85,"September 18, 2019","I usually give 5 stars, and would prefer to give 4.6 or 4.8, but that's not an option above. My only reason this time is that the repair took longer than anticipated, I think because, for some reason, they didn't start to even look at the car until the afternoon, instead of in the morning, so it wasn't ready until 6:30pm. The service rep said that it would be done by 5pm when I called around 1:30 to check on the status of the car. I never heard anyting further so I had to call back at 5pm to see if the car was ready for pick up and was asked if they could keep the car overnight to finish up the work. Since I needed my car the next morning, I said that wouldn't work, and then the rep said that the car would be ready by 6:30.. The service rep then sent me an email that was confusing and it looked like I was being charged $1400+ for the repair. The repair person who inspected the car and prepared the written email report listed 4 items and mistakenly indicated that they were red and not yellow so the report had to be corrected and re-sent to me. This is the second Lexus I have had and taken to Santa Monica Lexus -- I've always had great service, so this experience was a bit atypical. I realize that these are relatively minor complaints, but wanted you to have the feedback that follow up and accuracy could have been a bit better!

And besides the excellent customer service, they give you the best deals and are very straight forward in discussing costs.

I had been looking for a used Prius for over a few months. I saw the car I wanted on a website 
and when I called the Lexus dealership I reached  Mike Skobin. He was super nice and really listened to my concerns and what I wanted. When I said I didnt want to drive down there without having the deal made, he helped me to reach an agreement over the phone. The offer and counter offer processee was no stress.  He was warm, calm and friendly.  It was incredibly easy! In financing I met with Val Arvatz. He was kind and clear in reviewing the contract. He went out of his way to make me a good deal. And when I couldnt understand things he went over them repeatedly and patiently! until I got it.   The entire dealership staff is warm, friendly, and honest.

118,"August 17, 2019","I had an amazing experience with Lexus of Santa Monica because of Enrique Carvajal. I live 60 minutes outside of Los Angeles and when I told Mr. Carvajal that I was having issues coordinating buying a new car and transportation over to their dealership; Mr. Carvajal kindly arranged for an Uber to pick me up and bring me to the dealership. This was only the beginning of my remarkable and memorable experience with him.

Once I arrived at the dealership, the car I was interested in was already washed and ready for test-driving. Mr. Carvajal also took the time to teach me everything I needed to know to operate my new car. Before leaving he made sure that I remembered and understood what he had taught me by giving me a review and quizzing me on my knowledge. Mr. Carvajal even called to check on me after I arrived at my sister’s house with the new car that I bought from him.

Even his after sale customer care has been amazing. When I told Mr. Carvajal that I was missing a trunk part (the tonneau cover) he was very prompt to send me a new one free of charge. Instead of requiring me to return to the dealership for installation Mr. Carvajal had it delivered to my home as it is very simple to install.

Enrique Carvajal is very personable, knowledgeable, professional and efficient. I would buy 10 more cars from him if I could! I recommend him to anyone looking for a salesperson who goes above and beyond. Your experience with him will be one that you will truly appreciate and treasure.",5.0

181,"May 22, 2019","I appreciate that everyone at this dealership is uber-friendly, and works as a team to help you get a new car. From beginning to end, they make the process simple and seamless. I think it’s easy for sales people to forget, that  although they engage in this process day in and day out, it can be far more foreign and overwhelming for those that walk in the door. It’s also a major financial decision, so I truly appreciated the patience and respect I received during this process. Of course, at the end of the day it’s a business, and they want you to buy, but how they make that process, (painful or painless), and how they make the buyer feel, is entirely individual. This dealership gets it right. Bravo",4.8

I have so many bad things  to say about this place! But what is the point!  .... Take my advice Go Some Where Else! 

This is only one of many problems I had with this place.  

I had my coils changed on my car... (this is my first visit since I moved back to LA) let me add the service person  who originally help me was horrible. Left me standing there... told me he would be right back... and forgot about me.. I had to get out my car and ask for help! 😳

Let me fast forward... I got my car back... 1 month later I needed to get my oil changed.. I was talking to my husband ... I just so happen to pull up on the lever to open the hood cause he wanted to check the oil stick... and the lever was broke! Lexus was the last one with the car .. so I brought back in. They said it was minor and they would reattach it. I waited 15 or so minutes... they said it was fix... I believe them and left.. when I got home my husband ask if it was fixed.. I said... they fix it ... he said....did you check.. I said ....no.. I pull the lever ... it was the same! Nothing done! 

Ok... I was beyond mad... this Place is a 20 minute drive on the freeway one way.. I called to tell them it wasn’t fixed.. I was told to leave a message on my service person phone cause he was busy... I told The service lady .....I was on the way back.. and I better have someone take care of it cause I was mad as xxxx. 

My service person told me to calm down... how dare him ... what the xxxx... he should have check my car... wasn’t he the SERVICE PERSON... than do your job and service my car! 

Ok.Folks 
GO SOMEWHERE ELSE... 

This place is Horrible.... I will never come back here... I mean NEVER will come back here.. I am not buying my new car next month in Santa Monica! I hate this place! 

Oh... did I add... this was one of many problems I had here... But what is the point! ... I will never come back... the service is as good as management! Get it together Santa Monica! No one is going to pay for a luxury car... for you to treat your customers like they don’t matter. 😡

After visiting the local dealerships and not finding what we liked we decided to expand the radius of our search. My initial inquiry to Lexus Santa Monica was fielded by Alex Morales. Alex was on it with providing us the information that we needed and kept in touch via email and texts. At no point in time we felt we were being pressured to purchase a vehicle. Couple of weeks later we decided to ping the dealership again with an offer. One which we were comfortable with. Alex was not available at the time, but Elliot Gorski was. Again, we did not see any drop in customer service or the professionalism that Alex had exhibited. We were able to come to an agreement on a price within an hour and I told Elliot that we will be flying in to pick up car in the next couple of days. Since the pick up day was his day off, Elliot passed us on to Jeimy Llort to see the sale through and to ensure we were taken care off. We were not disappointed! By the time we landed, Jeimy had the car ready along with the paperwork for us to sign off on. In the finance department we met Lyndon Bull who was also a pleasure to deal with. This was by far the most pleasant car buying experience we have had to date. The individuals we dealt with are personable and thorough professionals who care about their customers. 5 star rating for them!

476,"July 18, 2018","All the personnel that I have dealt with (David this last time) at Lexus Santa Monica have been courteous and professional. The waiting room is extremely comfortable. But one cannot help but be keenly disappointed with the quality of Lexus design and engineering. My last two cars were Lexus ES, purchased new. The first gave me many years of excellent service--well over 100k miles with hardly a repair, My newer one is still under 100k miles and is falling apart, with repair after repair. And the repairs are outrageously expensive. $1,000 for a headlight!!!! $4,000 for a steering repair1 $300 to change a spark plug! Part of the problem is that Lexus is no longer a quality product. They especially fail at ""design for maintenance."" The high costs of a spark plug replacement is that so much labor has to be expended to get at the spark plugs themselves! And the headlight has needlessly complex housing and parts for what should have been a simple replacement. Unfortunately, there is no respite in the newer models if one want to stay with Lexus. They are now in the lower middle of the pack with a lousy ride and horribly bad human factors engineering with overly complex and non intuitive displays and controls. Don't take my word for it. Just read Consumer's Reports and take a test drive. It used to be that sitting in a Lexus provided a Lap of Luxury experience. Now a new Lexus resembles a bottom of the line 1976 Chevy at the nadir of American Auto manufacturing. Shame on Lexus!",4.2

Yes! I’m finally in a new Rx it took a bit longer this time but it made it that much sweeter this time around. Gotta say Enrique Carvajal made up worth it by stepping up to the newer Rx L. Car is great since I can now carry my daughters friends in the back and have the extra space. When I ask Enrique about the equipment level if it’s up to par with my current Rx he always says, “ Everything you currently have and more, never less” when I hear the words and heard the deal I couldn’t pass it up. I had to pick up my daughter from school that day and as always he made it so convenient by bringing me the car home. I understand is not something dealerships do or like doing but as always I appreciate the convenience. I trust Enrique so much that I have sent in at least 5 colleagues and they have had the same experience and purchased from him, including my own wife. Now if that doesn’t tell you the trust I have with him... I don’t know what will. Shout out to Oscar Aguirre as well for helping Enrique drive from Santa Monica all the way to the valley in traffic and showing me the car, remind me next time to get you a drink 🍻. Enrique’s the man no doubt. Nothing more comforting than seeing a familiar face after all these years and driving away in a car I got a great deal on.

I'm sure I could ask the front desk to change the channel, but the fact that this is the default tv station for a dealership in SM (and has been for years) tells me that someone there at the dealership is tone-deaf to where they're located and their target audience.

623,"March 12, 2018","The Santa Monica, CA Lexus dealer and Corporate Executive Office, REFUSE to replacement panels due to employee mishandling of order. I first made contact with Lexus of Santa Monica in October of 2016, regarding the panels with Service Assistant Victor Jimenez, he told me to come in for an inspection and told me it would be a while until the panels came in because the factory in Japan was running slow and he already had a customer who had been waiting several months. He told me to call in and check with him every three months or so, and I did exactly that. I would leave voicemails and he would call me back most of the time. Every time we spoke he would give me an update mentioning some customers were waiting over a year, and the factory delayed and at times halted production, and he would call whenever the panels arrived. I called in on 2-19-18, and asked to speak with Victor and was told he was no longer works with Lexus of Santa Monica. A woman needed Lorraina Flores, took the phone call, she very quickly told me there was no record of the panel being ordered their system, I replied no way there must be some mistake I have been speaking to Victor about this for order a year now. Lorraina replied there were was no order in the system and there was no text communication regarding the replacement. I was shocked and asks why would I have texted him about the replacement, I only text him when I was bringing the card in for service there was an issue and it just so happened that we discussed the replacement over the phone and in person and I didn't think I needed to document the conversation because the car has had several recalls and I have had them all and never had a problem, I would have never foreseen something like this. Lorraina also told me she was unable to contact Victor and insinuated I was not the only person this has happened to, she then told me I could reach out to corporate office where I was given the complete run-around for about a month. I first spoke with several customer experience representatives a woman named Cassy then it was ""escalated"" to Brook Malacen, then it was ""escalated"" to Marion on 2/21/18 and finally ended with Executive Corporate Office, a very koi and dismissive woman named Lindsey Tor, who told me there is nothing she can do and it is not a corporate problem the best thing I could do is to call the dealer back.

What do I do? Do I sue Lexus? I called the dealer back and left a third message for GM Matt Uger, but I have not heard anything back from him, it looks like they are very much aware of the foul play by their employee and don't want to accept responsibility and be held accountable for their employee's actions.

645,"January 28, 2018","Ready for this review? Buckle up! This is to recommend Enrique Carvajal for his hard work. Yesterday I drove to Keyes Lexus in Van Nuys at 8am to talk about my options since my IS 250 lease was up in a few weeks. Considering I originally leased with them in 2015 - I thought why not go back? Unfortunately they didn't have the color and style I wanted, and they were not willing to flex an additional $50 to make a customer happy. Their approach also lacked genuinity. 

On my disappointing drive down the 405 - I called different dealers and decided to just see what Lexus SM had in stock. With no intention to lease again THAT day, I just walked in and asked to see  all the cars. It just so happened that Enrique was next to Reception and he immediately took me under his wing. He took the time to show me what they had and how each car functioned (Keyes Van Nuys didn't show me much). I already felt the difference in customer approach with him vs. the other dealer. I gained knowledge I didn't have about the car I wanted and he worked with me to figure out what ""all in figure"" would make me a happy customer. This process felt natural and personalized which I appreciated. While this dealership still did not have the exact color I wanted, he made sure to provide me with all the options + more to see if there was anything that would catch my eye. 

Fast forward to finalizing a number (yes I found something I liked!), Enrique went back a few times to get me the happy number I had wanted. At one point I was ready to bounce (was already late to an event!), but Enrique remained patient. You'd think other salesman would try to break you down at that point (12pm) - he never did! Eventually we worked out a number plus other perks and we made a deal!!  

I left in my new 2018 NX 300 (8 miles on it) ready to conquer the world. I didn't expect to lease with Lexus SM that day, but it wasn't hard when you had a great representative - Enrique!

I would recommend him to anyone - he is willing to go above and beyond to work with you from start to finish!",4.8

647,"January 12, 2018","The level of service at Santa Monica Lexus has sunk to an all-time low.  At one time, their customer service was incomparable and spectacular. Not anymore! I took my car in because I was having problems with the climate system.  My service adviser, Victor Jimenez, gave me a rental and said he would contact me when it's fixed/ready.  Being that the car is a 2010 with an extended warranty, I was told they needed to further test it and would call me when it was ready.  Over the course of 5 weeks, Victor somewhat communicated with me via text. I had left several phone messages and zero was returned. I finally received a message that I needed to pick up the car, otherwise I would incur storage fees. When I called back, I was told Victor left Lexus over a month ago. xxx!  What about customer communication and quality control?  Why didn't someone notify me sooner?  All the while I presumed Lexus was dealing with warranty issues and I would be notified when the car was ready, but nothing was being done. I finally received a call from one Daniel Cabrerra, who is supposed to be the general manager, but could not provide me with a justified reason as to why nobody called me.  He tried to pin it on me by deflecting blame and I reminded him that it’s not my job to keep calling and calling.  It is Lexus’ job to notify me and provide me with updates as to when the vehicle will be ready.  It's not my job to keep following up.   Angel was my guy in the past and nobody compares to Angel, except for Douglas, who I was informed is no longer there, as well. In addition to the horrible and unacceptable customer service, my gas tank was on ""Reserve"" when I got it back. This leads me to believe someone drove my car without my authorization while it was SUPPOSEDLY being serviced.  In addition to an empty tank, my car had three VERY obvious dings and marks that were not there before.  I called Daniel Cabrerra again, and never received a call back to resolve my issues that Lexus Service Department created.  Also, I was told my battery didn’t pass the load test, which is a crock of crap because last year around this time, I was told the same thing by Lexus and I immediately took it to Cal Automotive, who is HONEST as the day is long, RELIABLE and QUICK and purchased a brand new battery for half the price.  Lexus Santa Monica is a complete and utter DISAPPOINTMENT with HORRIBLE customer service and a worthless service manager.  From now on, I will go to Jim Falk Lexus in Beverly Hills and rekindle my professional relationship with Angel Flores!  He’s competent, thorough and reliable!",2.0

658,"December 03, 2017","I purchased a pre owned Lexus RX350 I found on the internet. The car was priced below what the dealership paid for the car. It had been on the lot for 27 days so it was ""on sale"". The car is beautiful and was detailed to the 10's. I think because the car was a loss for the dealership the service I received during the purchase was a bit rushed and less than what I expected. The salesman told me he was getting a flat $175 for the deal and the dealership was losing money on the deal. So I think they just wanted to get me out the door quickly. Chris was pleasant but not exceptional. Gentle but constant pressure to purchase an additional warranty was a bit uncomfortable. Even with ""no"" as my answer the warranty deals kept coming at one form or another. The bright light was the gal (Carissa?? Not sure) who took care and time to show me how all the goodies on the car worked. She was a gem. When I got home I moved into my new car. It took about an hour. The interior lights were on. So the next morning the battery was dead. I was very surprised. I did not expect this. The Lexus roadside took over an hour to arrive and I learned they DO NOT include a battery check. Only a jump. You have to call AAA. Well, I love the car and I guess that's what counts most. 
The showroom is beautiful. Tuscan style, couches and piano playing. The coffee machine was mostly not working correctly and the ladies room was out of toilet paper. Not that important but if you offer luxury cars and luxury service, I expect attention to detail. ",4.5

Patrick is unique, not just in the auto industry, but in any industry, in my experience--and particularly so in a sales-related business. He actually listens to the issues with which I have a concern regarding my car's performance, he takes the time to review past repairs on my car so that he can advise with informed expertise and specificity, he provides honest and realistic (from my perception) advice regarding timeframes within which repairs should be made, he doesn't attempt to upsell me on needless repairs, and, whether learned or innate, he has an energy about him that is genuine, polite, and refined. Frankly, all of this is refreshing in this day and age. 

If your Lexus is in need of maintenance and you want to be treated well and treated right, then I highly recommend scheduling an appointment with Patrick Levenson at the Lexus Santa Monica service center.

716,"October 20, 2017","I never write reviews, but feel that based on this buying experience that I should. I was referred to Enrique Cavajal by a friend. I had received 3 different quotes from different Lexus dealerships. When I contacted Enrique I asked him the same questions as the others and asked him to give his best price. I provided all the dealerships with same information and the cars quoted were the same model and options. Enrique’s quote blew everyone else’s quotes out of the water. I asked Enrique how can his quote be so much lower and his response was “because I want to save you money and have you as a customer for life along your friends and family”. He made the process so smooth and fast. Not to mention it was on his day off. I provided all the info and on the next day when I picked up the car I literally spent an hour at the dealer. The car was washed, fueled and paperwork was ready for me. Quite honestly the best haggle free experience I’ve ever had. Enrique took the time to explain all the vehicles functions and even texted later that evening to check that we made it home ok.

I never felt pressured to speed things up. I needed tires.He quoted me their price and then went online to find the lowest price elsewhere, in which he ended up matching the price. I also needed rear struts. Never felt pressured to buy them at that time. Oscar told me I had some time. I ended up getting the work done the next week. They will never pressure you into getting any work done. They will always break it out into items that can wait awhile and those that need immediate attention. But it's always your decision.

Fast forward a few months and the disposition fee on my former lease is still being upheld. I contacted the dealership and they said they would take care of it right away and repeated again that the disposition fee would absolutely be waived. 

Several days later I was informed that Lexus was refusing to honor their policy of waiving the disposition fee as there had been a 3 month gap between the return of my Toyota and the purchase of my new Lexus lease - a fact that the dealership had neglected to tell me and actually admitted not to have even known. 

This Lexus dealership is untrustworthy. They gave me incorrect information, they misled me, and now they are completely unwilling to make good on their promise to me. Please stay away from them.",1.4

818,"June 29, 2017","My husband and I have been excellent, loyal customers for over 15 years and have leased 6 expensive cars from Lexus Santa Monica. 

Our salesman, Ron Holbrook, has never had to ""sell"" us a car. We've always called him a couple of months prior to the end is the lease to arrange for the next model. We are easy, no problem, customers who have never missed or been late on a payment. 

Ron has always encouraged us to turn in the lease a month or so early and they would ""take care"" of the last payment of the old lease. We know, it's, most likely, been wrapped into the new lease payment but we never complained. 

Last April, we received a 3 payment waiver offer from Lexus.  Ron told us to bring the car in about a month before the end of the lease for the best deal. There was, as always, 1 payment due on the old lease. Of course, the word from Ron was, ""we'll take care of it"".  Not to mention, we had the 3 payment waiver offer. Whatever that really means. 
Lexus Santa Monica took our old car, we signed the new lease papers and we were finished. 

4 months later, we receive a statement from Lexus for 1 lease payment and over $600 in ""damages"".  We were shocked and contacted Lexus SM to help sort this out. 

Unfortunately, it turns out, they don't really care about good, loyal customer issues are after you drive off the lot.

The GM, Mr. Unger, especially doesn't care. We seem to be pests to him.  He will not even provide us with his attorneys name and number.  
We waited for a month, fully expecting Lexus of SM to ""take care"" of this mistake, we received no response.  We, stupidly assumed they ""took care"" of it.  

Then, we started receiving outrageous phone calls from a belligerent collection agency.  Again, we were truly shocked by this treatment.  Interestingly, the collection agency told us that the dealerships will ""say anything to get the sale"" 

We contacted Lexus of SM several more times about this. They just passed the blame onto Lexus corporate. No help what-so-ever. 

We finally had to get our attorney involved and finally got the 1 lease payment removed, but not  the ""damages"" we were never made aware of until 3 months after the new lease papers were signed. Apparently, there is a hole under the front bumper. We had never seen it. How do we know they didn't cause the damage?  Why were we not made aware of this at the time we turned in the car?  Why were we not given the opportunity to repair this on our own? 

We reached out to Ron and Mr Unger at Lexus SM again. Again, they blew off our request to ""take care"" of this issue, as promised. 

My husband and I have been in sales our entire lives. This treatment is flabbergasting to both of us. Neither one of us would ever treat a customer this way.  At this point, it's purely principal. We told Lexus SM we would never buy a car from them again and they simply don't care.   

Wow...  is a few hundred bucks really worth losing a loyal customer who has leased  from them for 15 years?  


Things have changed at Lexus SM, so buyer beware! If you have a problem with your purchase or lease, after you sign, you can just eat it!

Next car, BMW or Mercedes. Hope we can find a dealer who respects loyal customers.

829,"May 30, 2017","Where to start? If I could I give this dealership ZERO stars I would. The only redeeming quality it has it has is that Paul and Josh seem to care. 
I flew down from the top of the state to purchase a 2014 GX,Josh picked me up at the airport (which I greatly appreciated ). The GX was advertised as 'L\Certified', low miles and perfect condition. When I arrived the GX was dirty, scratched, and the certification had been revoked due to a airbag being deployed. I did test drive the SUV and discovered that the drivers front door did not close properly. When I asked to speak to the head of certification, I was left sitting for two hours in the service department while they tried to track the man down. Finally I was able to speak to the manger of certification Tim Nelson, he had no idea why the car had gone through the cert process and had a door that didn't even close. No apology or even excuse. 
Suffice to say I had to switch gears and start the search over again. 
Paul expressed reasonable paitence with me as I had to test drive another 5 GX'S. 
After several hours I finally had it down to two SUV's and asked to discuss numbers with the manger. Roger the used cars sales manger came in and proceed to verbally barrage me with how much money he lost on the car I had rejected. He refused to negoiate a single penny. He left me in tears in Paul's office. I was appalled and insulted. I nearly walked out. However the fact that I had already sold my BMW the day before and was 700 miles from home left me with little choice but to move ahead and purchase a car. 
Being that I have a lot of experience in purchasing used cars I decided to try negations once more with Roger. It was an awful experience. However, I did get the price down by $500. 
I purchased a 2015 GX 460 'L\Certified'. The certification document that was supposed to be included in my final paperwork and documents was not provided. While driving the SUV home I discovered two of the seatbelts did not work and underneath the back seat was a cigarette butt. 
From my research cars that have been smoked in do not qualify for the 'L\Certified' program. Also the 161 point inspection for certification is supposed to review and test each and every safety belt. Clearly they did not throughly inspect the car. 
I have been reaching out to the dealership on multiple levels for several days with hardly response. Paul has returned my calls, only to say that he doesn't know where the certification document is.  None of the management, or finance department has cared to return my calls or emails. (I feel like they got my money and now don't care. Typical used cars salesmen).
 I called the nearest Lexus dealership to me and spoke to their head of 'L\Certifed' and used sales and they said that car I purchased should not have been allowed on the lot or at least priced appropriately to reflect its true condition. I also learned that I should have received new floors mats for the front, back seats and the rear storage area, as well as key gloves for the remotes. I only received mats for the front and back seats. 
If you want a true luxury car and experience go to BMW or MERCEDES. They at least deliver quality for the price. And most likely the sales manger won't yell and make you cry. 
Don't bother buying a certified or pre owned car here, their quality control is a joke.

I loved the new Lexus IS F sport, so Enrique helped me find the exact car with the package/colors I wanted, and for the price that I could realistically afford..

He was so friendly and personable during the entire 3 hours I was there.. he will do anything to help you get exactly what you're looking for and close the deal. He was a great listener, and really took the time to hear me out with what I wanted..and got me exactly that. As far as quality of make, the difference between BMW and Lexus if you're looking for a nice mid-price ranged sedan- is MAJOR. BMW is nice, but Lexus has so much more to offer for the same price. The IS series compared to BMW 3 & 4 series.. sleeker body style, better/more comfortable seats (lumbar support!!), color combos, engine, sound system, features, everything.. also it just drives so much better than my BMW and I'm soo happy with it.

914,"December 19, 2016","I went in to the Lexus dealer the other day to browse a certain car, not knowing that I would walk out with a car lease under my hand.   I walked into the dealer and someone had me speak with Enrique Carvajal within a few minutes.  From the very beginning, Enrique made me feel very comfortable.  Walking into the dealer can be a bit intimidating, especially if you have never leased or bought a car before.  This was my very first big purchase that I had done by myself, I didn’t know what to expect, I was told by many people to be weary of car salesman, but luckily I was placed in the right hands.   

I test drove a vehicle with Enrique and fell in love with the car.  After the test drive, Enrique and I sat down and discussed pricing.  During this time, Enrique had already stayed past his work hours and the dealership was about to close.  However, he never once rushed me or became pushy.  He took his time to thoroughly answer all my questions and made sure that I was comfortable with everything before I made my decision.  During that process, I also had to open up a new insurance policy… Enrique helped me call a few different companies to help me get a good monthly premium.  He gave me good insight on what I would need out of an insurance policy and within a matter of time, everything was good to go.  Once that was set in place, he gave me a great lease deal on the vehicle.

I wasn’t able to take the car home that night; I had to pick It up the next day.  Unfortunately, I was going to have to uber to the dealership after work during the worst rush hour in order to pick up my car, but Enrique insisted that he bring the car to me.  Enrique and one other driver drove in traffic from Santa Monica to Mid City LA just to bring me my car!  All in all, his service is impeccable and he really took the time and effort to help me.  It didn’t matter to him that he had to go out of his way by staying late that night and driving my car to me the next day.  He really is very personable and an all around good person.  If you are looking at Lexus vehicles, you must see Enrique at Lexus Santa Monica.

916,"December 15, 2016","I recently had an experience with my 2016 RX; my vehicle would not start! It seemed to be the battery; however how can a one year old car have a battery failure. I tried a few more times to start the engine; it tried to start but would just crank. After a few attempts I was getting a vacuum brake failure. I called Lexus to have someone come out and assist; after being on hold for several minutes. I decided to clear the alarm and try again. This time the car started; I made a bee line for Santa Monica Lexus. 
Angel greeted me and he must of noticed the anxiety on my face; he immediately brought over the lead mechanic. The lead mechanic jumped in my car and of course it started right up. The look on the mechanics face said it all. His first question to me was did I know how to start my Lexus? Really! I said, just to let you know this is my 4th Lexus and being a Bio-Medical engineer I know the question asked was not meant to belittle me; however any one would have taken that question that way. I shrugged it off and told the mechanic to check out the car and let me know what he discovers. Angel was the only one that believed me; he reassured me that he would personally make sure my vehicle was diagnosed until a problem was discover. He gave ma a loner car and sent me on my way. He texted me his mobile number and told me he would send me updates. I have been taking my vehicles to Santa Monica Lexus for over 10 years. The level of service is bar none in my book. Besides the lead mechanics questioning, I have always felt welcomed. Thank you Angel you are number 1 in my book. BTW the problem was a dead battery, go figure.

When that didn't work, he drove to my house during his lunch break and helped me to get it fixed. Now remember, he is in sales and this was above and beyond. This is the kind of person he is.

About 10 years ago, I had leased two Lexuses from Lexus of Santa Monica but felt that the quality of my service experience declined,, and so I decided to try another brand and just turn in my car.  It was then that I met Enrique Carvajal,  who was kind and helpful, even as I was leaving Lexus of Santa Monica.
I asked him for a card, in case I ever decided to come back.  Two years later, I was back and
leased my first of three cars from him.  Each experience was a pleasure; Enrique is knowledgeable,  helpful and personable..  I recommend him whenever I can and each person to whom I have recommended him, has had an incredibly satisfying experience.  I cannot imagine buying a car from anyone else",5.0

Enrique and his team were fantastic and helped get me into a new car with payments that were exactly what I was asking for without taking up my whole day.

In 24 hours from the time I said yes,. they orchestrated a trade, took a car down to San Diego, made the transaction and drove what became my new 2016 Lexus back to their dealership.
Before handing it over to me they made sure it was spotless and detailed, and gave me a comprehensive explanation and full demonstration of all the features, oh and a full tank of gas!
I've gone to several other dealerships doing my research and NONE compare to Lexus of Santa Monica. I purchased my last two Lexus's from them and this is my 3rd.
Their level of professionalism, consistency, honesty, service, and knowledge of their product as well as the competition is unparalleled. They really do go to great lengths to not just to get your business but to maintain it as well.
I have deep respect for Armen Injijian the Sales Manager. Its a hard job. Most consumers have prefixed opinions of car dealers from the salesman all the way up, which I'm sure only makes it tougher for them. He and Lexus of Santa Monica are on a whole different Level.
Armen put me with a new sales associate Nima Ataei, Boy did I make it tough on him! I've very impressed with how he handled me. He's eager, patient and most importantly a gentleman.
I'm very happy with my new car  I made the right choice staying with Lexus of santa Monica.

1123,"November 14, 2015","My family has been coming to this Lexus location for years. My parents purchased 3 cars from this location and as of today, I'm on my 2nd lease from this location - that alone should speak to the dealership experience itself. 

My 1st lease from here was a Lexus is250 F Sport (which ends March 2016). Lisa from Lexus emailed me 5 months before the lease ended to buy out my lease for a new car -- had no idea what this was and what I was getting myself into. Do they want my car back? Is this just a check-in? 

Walked in to meet my sales contact Bob U. and he introduced me to Enrique C. Enrique was great. He let me know what the benefits were to this meeting and why I should consider getting out of my lease now instead of 5 months later. He showed me a CT200h and IS200T by understanding my must-haves and walked me through the differences. Also brought down the exact car that I'd potentially be walking away with so I can see it for myself. In the end, it was a numbers game and he hugged whoever he needed to hug to get it down to where I needed it to be, and I walked away with a 2016 White CT200h - thanks Enrique!",5.0
1124,"November 10, 2015","After an exhaustive search for a new luxury car we thought we had finally decided on the Mercedes GLE. We went into our search with open minds not wanting to exclude any auto dealer, Infinity, Volvo, Cadillac, Audi, even BMW. Just as we were about to call Mercedes we decided to look at Lexus. Living in the Pasadena area we decided to visit Longo Lexus in El Monte. We really wanted to see and test drive the 2016  RX350 sport. Upon hearing that the car would not be available until January, I made the choice to leave this dealer and find another. I placed a call to Lexus of Santa Monica and requested to speak to a sales agent. After a brief hold we connected with Enrique Carvajal. He stated they had a 2016 RX350 sport on the lot that we could test drive. 
We had the BEST experience on our test drive with Enrique! He delivered an incredible knowledge of the car and all its working components. Mostly Enrique listened to our needs and what we were needing and wanting in a Luxury car. After spending hours with us trying to locate the perfect color (exterior/interior) with all the bells and whistles we wanted we narrowed it down to the RX350. Caught between two cars that we loved Enrique was instrumental in helping us with our decision to purchase Lexus over Mercedes. I would buy all my cars from Enrique, and I would also advise anyone looking for a new car to make sure you visit Santa Monica Lexus and ask to deal only with Enrique Carvajal!

1182,"January 27, 2014","Tim Nelson at Santa Monica Lexus is an excellent Service Consultant who has helped me to have outstanding service experiences  since he first helped fix a difficult noise issue with my new IS350 over 6 years ago (he heard me, drove with me, heard the problem, communicated it to the techs and they fixed it!).

Whether I go in for a recall repair or routine service, Tim is warm, helpful & professional - and he seems genuinely happy to see me! His high standards and attention to detail are very helpful.  For example, I went in for a recall repair recently, but when Lexus did the courtesy check of all systems, topping off fluids, checking the brakes & tires, etc., they found that two tires needed to be replaced. Tim pro-actively contacted my Tires For Life warranty rep & got that ball rolling while keeping me informed throughout via text, email & phone calls. Tim advocates quite well to get things accomplished and completed in a timely fashion.

I have to go to Lexus for all services to keep my Tires For Life agreement valid. I wasn't happy about it initially, but I hoped it would be worth it. As it turns out, Tim at SM Lexus makes it a pleasure and never something I worry about at all. I'm usually greeted immediately, enthusiastically, & with a big smile by Eddie Sanchez - & Tim pops out a moment after him. After a friendly hello, Tim reminds me to take everything I might need- rattling off suggestions,  ""remotes,  chargers...."" so I forget nothing- & he makes sure I have mentioned any & all concerns and quickly we're at his desk completing paperwork. 

Tim then walks me to the cashier & helps secure the helpful Courtesy Loaner Lexus that makes service visits seemless - almost no lost time & no lost vehicle. Perfect! Tim reminds me to have some delicious fresh coffee (if he hasn't already brought it to me - for real!) & a snack and, after sitting for 1-2 minutes, I'm called up & checked out.  Santa Monica Lexus is quick, efficient & polite.  And, all of that is usually withOUT an appointment.

Finicky Bluetooth usually sends me to Parker Hawley (thanks again!!) or another willing and helpful team member to pair my phone with my Courtesy Lexus - the whole team is relaxed, comfortable & seems to really enjoy their work.

Over the years, Tim has helped me understand and fully utilize my warranty, he's taken time to be sure I fully understand what's happening with my car so I can make the most informed decisions possible. He's helped me feel safe & gotten me in quickly when recall issues come up. Tim truly makes me feel like I'm his only customer & this his job is to make me happy. And he does! I am in very good hands with Tim Nelson at Santa Monica Lexus.",4.8
1183,"January 22, 2014","Mario Gonzales is by and far the best service consultant I've encountered while bringing my Lexus vehicles into the Santa Monica shop. Generally, when making an appointment online, the service consultant that I was ""appointed"" to was never the person that ended up helping me. And, yes, this happened again.

I have a new Lexus that needed a basic 5000-mile service done. Had an appointment with another person, but that person conveniently was out to lunch, even though I was booked with him.  The welcome crew went and got Mario for me. He was all smiles and welcoming, like he was my appointed consultant all along.

Because my new Lexus was purchased at another dealership, my car wasn't in the SM system...not a problem. Mario quickly went through the records and made the updates to ensure that my new car and I were updated in their database. The entire time, Mario was friendly and thorough, making me smile and laugh with small personal stories, as well as telling me about how fantastic and fun my current car is. He easily was able to tell me about the other services the SM location offered, without it being a ""hard"" sell, but also telling me what they'd be doing to my car, and what I should be on the lookout for in the years to come.

He check on me during my wait, and pretty much ensure that because I was waiting in the lounge, that my car was done quickly and efficiently, and even washed.

Needless to say, he'll be my main consultant whenever I have to go back to get my car serviced.",5.0

I contacted a dozen Lexus dealerships in Southern California with what I was looking for an my price range. Most of the dealerships only sent generic responses or did not reply at all. Lexus of Santa Monica was one of the four dealerships that made an earnest attempt to get my business. I narrowed it down to Santa Monica and another dealership, and both made competitive offers. In the end, I went with Santa Monica Lexus because Jorge and MIke delivered every single item I was looking for including price, extras, color, and even found me a car with Michelin tires to top it off.  Jorge was very good about staying in touch with me by email and calling me from time to time to update me on status of deal. Jorge was my go-to-guy for this transaction and Mike made it all possible. Car came in on a weekday from Port of Long Beach and I was able to pick it up at dealership on a weekend. Painless process. Bob Uchida, Finance Manger, took care of financing and got me a great APR so I gladly went with Lexus Financial. They pulled credit report from Experian and TransUnion. Sara Grimwade gave me a tour of the car was was very pleasant. 

Another thing I like about this dealership is that its interior design is very open and inviting. Feels like you're in lobby of a hotel.

I appreciate the fact that Mario makes every effort to ensure that I am satisfied with his service as well as that of the Dealership as a whole.

Truth be told, I stem from a very humble background. Owning a luxury vehicle such as a Lexus was a rather bold step for both my wife and I. But after getting a taste of the unmatched customer service offered at this Dealership, I feel completely justified in splurging a little for our Lexus. At the time of purchase, neither my wife nor I realized that when buying a Lexus, you are buying more than just a luxury vehicle, you are also opening the doors to the superb service that Lexus employees like Mario Gonzalez offer on a daily basis.

I am grateful to Mario and Lexus of Santa Monica for treating me with class and respect. It is not everyday that one gets to walk into a facility and get treated like a king. Truly amazing!

The only answer Kevin could give is ""I am sorry"", this was my first special order. Now he and the dealership are trying to forget about their mistake because they don't want to spend the couple of hundred dollars of the wind screen installation kit. Very poor, unethical and unprofessional way to treat customers and their written commitments
I am presently placing my complaint with the main Lexus customer service which so far understood and were going to follow up on solving Santa Monica Lexus's mistake. 
Overall this dealership is embarrassing, not having the professional decency of trying to fix Kevin's inexperienced mistake.  ",2.0

1238,"December 09, 2011","I have been to the Lexus Santa Monica service shop 3, or 4 times now and all of my experiences, except this last one, have been great. The service was unorganized and exceptionally unfriendly during this visit. Not that everyone there was rude but that the employee I was working with did not give me all the information I needed and he simply did not make me comfortable. It's widely known that getting service done at the dealership is more expensive than other mechanics and of course studies have shown how women are more likely to be scammed by mechanics or repair shops than men. Yet, until my most recent visit here I did not feel that was the case. I researched the price and types of tires, front wheel & side mirror I actually could have gone with and the cost of parts, labor + alignment at another shop would have saved me over $600! The person helping me of course neglecting to explain the different options I could have gone with leaving me to think my model could only use one type of tire. When I asked for a write up of all this he didn't include any details! It was a ludicrous report and because it was a holiday weekend I really felt pressured into agreeing quickly so he could get the parts in before my trip out of town. The parts were still late and my car was ready days after the estimated date which had me rushing back from NorCal to return the loaner car before incurring the late fees ($60/day). I could go on about other details but basically the service is hit or miss here and like anywhere, you need to do your research beforehand. ",2.6
1239,"November 30, 2011","I would never buy any CPO Lexus vehicles here again and would certainly not recommend this dealership due to the very poor quality of the vehicle and service of this sales gentleman.

I bought a 2008 RX 400h from this dealer in February this year. Before making a decision to buy this vehicle, he explained to me that this vehicle used to be a lease to a private party and was very clean & no accident/damage. The CARFAX reported that this dealer provided was also showing that there was no accident/damage.
9 months after the purchase, I had a chance to see the latest CARFAX report of this vehicle and have been very shocked to know that this vehicle had an accident in July this year (BEFORE I PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE) and the CARFAX began reporting it in June this year (AFTER I PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE).
Considering that this vehicle was a lease from this dealer and this dealer certified it as a CPO before selling it to me, it is impossible for me to believe that ""They did not know if this vehicle had an accident before selling it to me and they are now checking with the CARFAX."" 

It has been more than a week and he has never called me back to update the status as to what to do. 

This is nothing but a fraud to me and thus, I would never recommend this dealer.

Not only did I get the car I wanted, a CT200 hybrid, but they bent over backwards to make the deal work for me - including sending me to another dealer to get my trade in, a Volvo S60, appraised so that I could get a better trade in value than Lexus was offering.

1244,"July 30, 2011","May have been the worst experience I have ever had buying a car. 

Upon my first trip to Lexus of Santa Monica, I was greeted by Jimmy Kim, a very nice sales/loan manager.  After looking at the vehicles, I told him exactly what I was looking for- a Tungsten Pearl Rx350 w/ navigation and luxury package w/ grey interior.  I also gave him the competitive price I was quoted from another dealership (Glendale).  Jimmy told me that while the quote was low, he would do the deal in order to gain my business.  He didn't have the exact car in stock that I wanted, so I waited a couple weeks and finally Jimmy called- the car I wanted was in!  

The only hitch was that it was a 4WD vs. 2WD.  Jimmy explained that this should be no big deal- maybe about $5 more per month. So I came into Santa Monica, saw the vehicle, filled out the paperwork, spent about 3 hours through the process.  Finally, they went to process my  paperwork and suddenly the manager realized that they didn't want to make this deal on the car I had been promised and waited weeks for.  Lexus would be losing thousands on the deal, they said.  

Instead the manager pulled the old bait and switch and tried to sell me on a Blue 2WD vehicle!  Additionally, the manager became very rude and defensive when I questioned him on this tactic.

Leaving the dealership, I truly felt like the customer was not valued at all.  They told me what I wanted to hear, so that they could try to earn my business, and then when it was time to close the deal, they were hoping I would just roll over and let them up-charge me. 

This experience was so frustrating and wasted weeks of my time.  A similar experience happened to me at their dealership 3 years ago.  I would absolutely recommend that you avoid this dealership at all costs.

Now, the great part - these are nice, good people to deal with.  I am not always the easiest person to work with and they did an excellent job of identifying and meeting my needs.  If they can do that with me, they can certainly do it for you.  On top of that, they kept their word on every part of the deal and in friendliness, kindness and courtesy they did even better than they promised.  My wife says and I agree that we would give them 10s instead of 5s, if we could.

Roxie, will definitely get my first and/or last shot the next time we buy a Lexus.

1285,"January 07, 2011","I had shopped around on the internet for pricing on a LS 460 L and had 3 specific colors that would suit me.  Andrew was the only internet sales agent from any dealership who followed up with me over a period of 2-3 weeks with several emails attempting to meet my wishes.  I went to the Santa Monica showroom to experience the rear seat upgrade that I wanted and ended up buying a car not  my color choices.   I should have looked at the granite color in the beginning of my search.  Andrew's personality and demeanor were professional and friendly and helpful with suggestions that made changing my color choice very easy and satisfying.  I am thrilled with the car,  and the dealership offered a price during the year-end sale on the 2010 models that made it impossible to pass up. ",5.0

I highly recommend buying a car from Ron.",5.0

These folks were working real hard to earn my business.  Actually, while I got a nice car LS 460L top of the line, I do not believe the dealer made much money.  They gave me a maintenance package at a very great price.  I would buy my second car there.  Above all these folks were honest.  Yes honest, something rare today.

1289,"November 09, 2010","We found this excellent dealer from an Internet search of Certified Pre-Owned Lexus vehicles.  They had precisely the RX-400h that we wanted and negotiated with us for a very competitive price including a 0.9%, 36 month loan.  The entire staff was very helpful, friendly, and professional, making our purchase a throughly pleasant experience.  We were so impressed with Lexus Santa Monica that the next day we returned and purchased an ES-330 for my mother-in-law. The vehicle was also immaculate and very attractively priced.  One bit of shopping advice ... you seem to get the best deal if you approach Lexus Santa Monica through their Internet sales department. 

The interior of this dealership is absolutely beautiful, with a Spanish Hacienda decor, player grand piano, complimentary refreshments, impressive fountain ... surrounded by a bevy of new Lexus vehicles.  One of our daughters will soon need a new car and Lexus Santa Monica is the first place we'll go shopping.

1290,"October 15, 2010","Smoke and mirror sales!? - ? Don't shop here!

The sales manager said she would beat the price we had and quoted a so-called Costco and AAA discount over the phone but when we got there the price was higher than the price we were trying to beat. 

To make up the difference she sent us to Car-Max on Manchester to get a better price for our trade-in. We went on a leap of faith that she was honest and knew what she was doing. She told us she sends lots of customers there and they have gotten far more than SM Lexus could give. 

What's really interesting about this is that Santa Monica Lexus had appraised our car about six weeks before for $1,500 more. At that time we were thinking about a pre-owned vehicle - now we decided to go with new. 

Anyway, the Car-Max adventure was a total and complete waste of time! One other thing....this manager insisted that the salesperson explain that the cost increase was due to the new and improved braking system on the 2011 model. The add-on is to stop the vehicle if it's going over 80 mph and the brakes fail. Let's do a reality check on this....I see this as strictly a compliance requirement to keep people from getting killed from a known defect in design. This ""spiel"" was almost enough to make us shop for another brand!

The inside of this dealership is pure faux (aka - phony!) and so are the people.If you are serious about buying a car - go to a dealership that is up front and straight forward - not SM Lexus!!! 

We bought the same car the next day for a far better price at a dealership out in the Valley - they were honest, respectful and priced to sell.

I had to have the car towed back as it was posesed! (sounds funny now, but I could have killed someone!) I have NEVER had this expierience with a car in my life.

They said the trottle was jammed open with something, they repaired it and then it started leaking. This was the reason I took it to them in the first place!

They repaired it yet again and then they scratched it!
They offerd to repair the scratch but I said ""No Thanks"" ""I'll live with it""

1293,"January 13, 2009","Well, I can only speak about my own experience, I have read some positive reviews as well before.  I had been shopping around for a new Lexus for about 2 weeks through the internet.  I spoke with Scott Allen over there who wanted to know the best deal I had to see if he could match or beat it.  After I told him of the deal, he said he would get back to me.

The next day he called and said they would match the deal and throw in XM, which made Santa Monica Lexus the place I was going to buy.  I then agreed to buy it from him two days later and asked that they email me the quote which he agreed to do.  The next day arrived and still no quote, so I called Scott and he said he wasn't sure why it had not been sent, but not to worry as the deal for my car (which was a specific model/color) was still  good.  In fairness to Scott, he said his boss approved the deal and it was his boss who would be sending out the quote to me.

The next day (the day I was supposed to buy the car there) came and although there was still no quote, I went to go  buy it at the agreed appointment time.  That's when things went down hill.  I arrived and was not asked by anyone if I needed help.  I made my way to what appeared to be an information desk in their beautiful showroom and asked to speak with Scott.  The woman was a bit rude, but paged him and that was all I really needed done anyway.  No harm.  

A couple of minutes later Scott came out and not only barely remembered me, but had no idea of the car we talked about.  After going to a desk with a computer that didn't work, he got up to go see about the car.  He came back with some papers shuffling around and then we went to a different desk with a working computer.  That's when the games started.

Keep in mind, we already did the deal over the phone.  Went over everything from exact color, model, price and even the out the door price.  Now, all of a sudden my car was not in stock.  He starts telling me that all I could do was take one of the other models they had, a different color or take the ""base model.""  When I stated that I was not going to compromise the color I wanted and that he promised they had for me, he rudely said, ""Well, we're compromising on the price, so you need to compromise.""  Don't blame me for a price that you agreed to do.  I was very offended that.

Can you say Bait And Switch?  In addition, I was never offered that they could order my car.  Hell, I was never even offered a water that I saw many others being given by one of their staff.  My experience here was terrible and really left me with a bad taste in my mouth for Lexus in general.

Your experience might be different from mine,but a word of caution, if you do go the internet route here, be weary of their lines to get you in there and don't go in until they send you the quote on the car they have for you WITH the VIN number.

I hope you have a better experience than I did there.  I ended up going to another Lexus dealer who although they didn't have the car in stock either, put an order in for it at the agreed price.  I had two other Lexus dealers in SoCal inform me that although they would have done my deal, they unfortunately did not have my car in stock.  I found my treatment at Lexus of Santa Monica to be very bad.",1.6

1299,"February 16, 2006","The sales staff convinced me to sign some documents to approve my financing and to put a $1000 ""refundable"" deposit down. I was told that my deposit would reserve the car for a week, and it would be refunded if I chose not to buy. Every time I signed something, and when I put down the money, I asked, ""Does this mean I'm buying the car?"" Every single time, I was explicity told ""No, you are not buying the car."" I left the car on the dealer's lot and went home to think about it.

I later decided not to buy the car. They told me I had purchased it and threatened to force me to pay for it. They ultimately backed down, but refused to refund my $1000 deposit. I mailed them back some documentation on the car that they had lent me, and they denied receiving anything--despite the fact that I tracked the US Postal shipment by certified mail.

These guys are EXTREMELY dishonest and highly manipulative. They are out to rip you off in any way possible. Everyone there lied to me, from the salesperson (Brent Turner), to the finance manager (name unknown), to the sales manager (Alan McLaughlin).
