0,"May 20, 2020",I had a superb experience at Walter's! I was a first time buyer and everyone treated me so well. I worked with David Le from the moment I walked in the dealership. He was friendly and welcoming. He is down to earth and he worked very hard to get me what I wanted. He wasn't pushy and that's what I loved the most. I was treated as if I was already a loyal customer. Thank you so much David Le and the team at Walter's Audi.Dreams really do come true. ,5.0

2,"May 19, 2020","Wanted to take time and give a shout out to Ryan Gonzalez Walter's Audi. Great Salesman made it happen. For me a 2% rate which helped my payments tremendously. Drive off in a 2019 Audi Q7
I recommend Ryan to anyone seeking to purchase A Audi. Top dollar for my trade. I was surprised. All around wonderful experience. Also shout out to the sales Managers.

6,"May 15, 2020","Very pleasant experience as far as car buying go's.  Had the car I was initially interested in up front but I decided to look at another of the same model with lower mileage and Joshua Rambow went out of his way to accommodate me. Ended up purchasing the lower mileage vehicle. Guess the only regret is they wouldn't let me test drive the $200K+ sports car, understandably.  ",5.0

11,"May 11, 2020","The odds were stacked against this being a good car buying experience:
100+ mile drive to the dealership
COVID-19
A reluctant car buyer on crutches worried about test driving a vehicle

Actual experience:
Super friendly Dennon Whaples who greeted us at the door at the time of our appointment, offering water and individually wrapped snacks. Everyone wearing masks to make us feel comfortable and a spotless showroom and restrooms. Every detail handled with ease, professionalism and lighthearted conversation. Andy Bartoli actually made signing up for car payments fun with some great stories. The delightful afternoon ended by riding off into the sunset with the top down on my new (to me) convertible. I don't buy cars often, but this team beat the odds and made my car buying experience worth the hurdles to make it happen. Thank you!

13,"May 11, 2020","We were concerned about COVID 19 and how to safely turn in our lease car and purchase another; but Brett McKinley made the entire process seamless and easy. Brett found the car we were looking for, put together the paperwork, and delivered the new car to our driveway. All we had to do was drop off our lease car, and select the color we wanted. Since we are ""social-distancing"" and so is Brett, we never got to shake hands but want to say ""Job well done and Thank You""",4.6
14,"May 11, 2020","We recently purchased our A3 at Walter's Audi and I have to say that it was honestly the easiest/fastest/smoothest car buying experiencing my fiance and myself have ever had. To start with, they actually honored the price the car was listed for that was originally a mistake. Todd Bellis and Josh Rambow were GREAT to work with and were attentive to our needs. Andy B. in finance was also great to work with and even added in some ""extras"" for a seriously amazing price. I can't say enough great things about Walter's Audi. ",5.0

19,"April 30, 2020","Service Advisor Alex Ortiz has continued to provide the level of service you expect from a luxury car brand.  Red carpet service actually.  We brought our Q7 in for a strange noise and unbeknownst had run over something in the road.  The technician took a video of the damage and Alex sent it to me for review.  I contacted our insurance carrier and Alex took care of it from there.

We have and will continue to be a patron of this dealership

20,"April 22, 2020","Josh Rambow went way out of his way to not only to deliver a car to me 80 miles away, but took the time to go over and respond back to questions regarding my new purchase with complete and detailed answers.

29,"April 05, 2020","I visited Walter's Audi back in October 2019 to ""just look"" at new cars and to get a sense of the trade-in value of my current Audi Q3.  Not only did Walter's Audi offer me the highest trade-in value of any dealership I visited that month, but they helped me choose all the features I wanted in a custom order.  Although a custom made car takes longer to get, you definitely get what you want.  Even after five months waiting for the new car to arrive, Walter's Audi barely depreciated the original quoted trade-in value -- in other words, the value of my trade-in was pretty much the same five months later even though I added 3,000 miles to the car.  

Cory Williams clearly communicated everything to make the day I visited the dealership a breeze.  He knew all of the new features of the car and showed them in detail.  Of course, all the courtesy subscriptions were already activated and my first drive was a true pleasure.  

Though I don't live close to the Walter's Audi dealership (and there is an Audi dealership very close to my home), I choose to do business with Walter's Audi because of their terrific showroom,  excellent service department and welcoming, professional staff.  I wouldn't go anywhere else.",4.8

33,"March 25, 2020",I bought a  vehicle from Walters a couple years ago.  My wife and I had no issues with our sales personal .Clearly they have no issue with taking our money on a new vehicle but when it comes to service they fail!!  Stacy greets you with a very rude attitude and Mr.Carrillo in parts is even more rude and un professional ! Had I known what I’ve learned recently I would have bought from another dealer .. FAIL FAIL!,1.0

37,"March 17, 2020","My recent visit to Walter’s Audi did not feel like a dealer’s visit. Todd Bellis made it pleasant and smooth. I would highly recommend this dealer, but most importantly Todd Bellis. He’s patient, polite and knowledgeable about the product he’s selling. ",5.0

40,"March 16, 2020","I had a very pleasant experience purchasing my A6 here.  Syed Ali provided excellent customer service with no high-pressure sales techniques like you encounter at other dealerships.  Everyone was great, except the finance guy.....I paid cash, but before I could sign the contract, he kept trying to get me to purchase an extended warranty and service contract even though I said no several times.... sort of irritating.",5.0
41,"March 12, 2020","I would like to first say thank you to Joshua Rambow and Andrew Bartoli for helping me finance my 2017 Audi A4 ultra Premium. The experience from start to finish was very pleasant experience. I came inside the dealership knowing what I wanted already; they were there to assist me obtain what I wanted. They gave me a reasonable trade-in value for my previous car. They were also able to explain each options that were available for the Audi. Very straight forward explanation of the features and monthly payments. If I was looking for another Audi, I would definitely go to this dealership again.",4.8

43,"March 12, 2020","Drove past many other Audi dealerships to go to Walter’s Audi based on other positive reviews.  Now is my turn to leave a positive review—Ryan Gonzalez is a wonderful salesman.  He answered all my questions as I was trying to decide what car to get. He was thoughtful, kind and when I finally made up my mind, he went above and beyond to deliver the car to me (an hour away) that afternoon. Ryan is fantastic, and I highly recommend him and Walter’s Audi. ",5.0

45,"March 11, 2020",It was time for me to turn my leased A7 in and I was lucky to get Cory Williams as my salesman.  Corey helped me find a replacement vehicle and made the entire transaction pleasant and easy.,5.0
46,"March 10, 2020","As always, Stacy Samuel was top notch in getting our vehicle serviced and making sure we were kept updated on its status.  

Where both Stacy and Dave Butler excelled was in helping us with a chronic problem we’ve had with the brakes on our 2017 Q7..  Audi of America hasn’t been helpful because squealing brakes aren’t a safety problem.   Audi of America did send us an email that states:  “We work tirelessly to help you enjoy everything about your Audi”.  Well for over 60,000 miles we’ve had a chronic issue that won’t allow us to “enjoy everything about our Audi”.  We’ve opened up multiple service orders requesting help on our issue because it causes us to be embarrassed that we’re driving an Audi.

I want to clearly note that Walter’s Audi in Riverside has been as helpful as possible in dealing with this issue.  Both Stacy Samuel and David Butler represent the goal and mission statement set for the Audi brand.

Believe me when I say I am very picky about my automobiles, but Todd had the patience I needed to make an informed decision. He was also very knowledgeable about the A6 I was interested in; going over all the features, but was never pushy. Thanks to him, I left with a beautiful A6 with all the features I wanted.

80,"February 02, 2020","My car buying experience at Walter's Audi was my first car buying experience and it was great. I first met with Romen Artalejo who gave me a lot of time to look at the car I was interested in. Romen was extremely patient and gave me the time and space to explore the car both on my own and with him. At the end of my first visit, I didn't feel any pressure. The message from both Romen and the manager, Eric Lafever, was that it was first important to make sure that the car was the right car for me. This made me feel very comfortable with the dealership. I came back to the dealership the next day and was helped by George Doukas. George was also very patient and helpful. I was able to take a second test drive in the car with George and after the test drive, I sat down with George to move forward with the purchase. I told George what specific color and features I was looking for and he helped find the exact match, he helped in coordinating getting the car from a sister dealership, and he worked with the manager to help me close the deal. George was very friendly, great to do business with, and helped make the process easy for me. After I finished the purchase, George made sure to show me around the new car, helped take some photos for me with the car, and overall helped make the experience great. The manager, Eric Lafever, was very friendly and professional and Andy Bartoli in Finance was also very friendly, helpful, and great to work with as I finalized the purchase.

One issue to watch is that they hit my credit 3 times. Do not fill out the online app for it’s unnecessary. The three times lowered my credit score by exceeding the credit inquires.

207,"July 15, 2019","   Drove from San Diego because Walter's had an Audi Q5 advertised at a way better price than all their competitors. I've seen their ads before on Cars.com but never thought to drive the 88 miles from my house. I needed to trade in an older BMW X5 so I decided I needed to buy at a dealership and not a private party. They ""guaranteed"" they would take my car in trade and with the ad price being significantly lower I figured I couldn't lose so I made the drive. Best and luckiest move ever. Their car was virtually identical to the others, a fully loaded Q5 Premium Plus, with the same mileage. 
   I met Todd and he is a gem. Nice personality, really prides himself in knowing everything about the cars and is a professional. A pleasure to deal with and I felt he was very honest and straight forward.

I have always viewed them as a necessary evil, but yesterday I had the very best experience I could have ever hoped for from Eric Lafever and Walter's Audi.  Eric gave me the buying experience I was looking for.  I didn't want to wait for hours while go back and forth with pricing - you know how they say ""I don't know if we go that low - let me talk to my manager"" and they leave you sitting there for 10-20 minutes waiting (while they probably talk about baseball or whatever else) and try to gradually wear you down.  Eric didn't do that.  I told him upfront that I wanted a fair price and didn't want to spend my entire day there and he made it happen.  When I arrived at the dealership, the car I wanted to test drive was ready and waiting for me.  Eric greeted me, ready to go.  I wasn't on the lot 2 minutes before I was test driving my car!  When we got back, he offered us water and pastries and once we were comfortable, we started the process.  We had a discussion - he took down my information - the price he gave me was $2000 under Kelley Bluebook!  No haggling.  After running my credit check, Eric walked me over to the office that would finalize my contract!  While I was signing the contract, Eric had arranged to have my car washed, the gas tank filled and even gave my son a gift certificate to spend in their Audi store!  Since we had some time to kill, I asked if it would be okay to take my car rental back since it was around the corner.  The service manager said if we needed a ride back, he would be happy to arrange it and asked me to call to let him know.  When I got back from dropping my rental off, the car was ready and Eric pulled it around to the front and familiarized me with the car.  I was in and out of there in record time.   It was the BEST car buying experience I have ever had and even though it was an hour from my house, I plan to drive out there next time I need a new car.  It was amazing.  I can't say enough good things about them.  THANK YOU ERIC!   I couldn't be happier with my new car.",5.0

Just a few words about my experience with Brett Mckinley at Walter's Audi Riverside.  
I am an Audi lover (this is my 6th).  I usually lease and return at another location but they did not have what I was looking for and their pricing wasn't as competitive.  
I had sent in a request to Walter's ( because it was after hours, and Brett called and emailed me back the next day.
He was willing to creatively get my payment to where I needed it with an aggressive deal and arrange for paperwork and pick up the same day.  My car was detailed and ready to go on arrival, with paper work ready and no hidden surprises.  

There usually is the hidden game that happens with car sales but here at Walter's with Brett it did not.
He took his time and showed me the new features on my S5.
Rob in finance was also great, very speedy and efficient too.

I would highly recommend Brett to anyone looking for an Audi, 5 *****!

Despite the 655 dollars I had to pay to fix the tire my overall experience was good. The staff was friendly and Mike in particular was very kind and humbled. He seemed to be the only one who was sympayhetic towards my circumstances whereas some of the other staff seemed to care only about getting their money for the tire. That's fine, it was my fault so I'll take responsibility but some of the other staff made a crappy situation only feel worse.

381,"January 16, 2019","I visited Walter’s Audi for a scheduled service. I think I had the best experience with a service adviser so far with Alex Wong. He treats you well, respects you, doesn’t come off as “too busy for you” and doesn’t treat you like you don’t know anything. Sometimes in the past I’ve felt like the adviser didn’t take enough time to explain the service being done, the reason for the service, or communicate with me effectively or treat me in a genuine fashion. I think that as a service adviser, it’s easy to have fake interactions with customers, since you’re handling so many people, and many of them know nothing about cars. But Alex took the time to connect with me and do a thorough job when going over paper work, and checking me out. You can tell he wants to make the customer feel taken care of. Thanks Alex.

This would be my first service after my service package ended. I had no idea what to expect, price wise. Needless to say, once I was informed, I was surprised by the amount.

He understood what I was feeling and he really went out of his way to help find some discounts to apply so that the total amount due would be a bit lower. Alex was very familiar with Audi vehicles and vehicles in general.

Todd Bellis our sales person took us around the dealership looking at new Q5's with a variety of features to determine what would suit us best.  We found a car but not the right color.  Todd worked hard  to find the color and features of the Q5 at another dealership.   I returned a few days later to sit with Todd and go over the details of the sale.  During our conversation Mike Anchondo, the sales manager, came in to inform me that he was not going to get me the car in the color I wanted.  He offered me an alternate color car that was in stock.  After much discussion, I thanked them for their time and left the dealership as the situation was very frustrating since I was told they had found the car in the color I wanted.  Within 20 minutes I received a call from Todd and Mike saying that they would get the car I wanted.   From that point Todd was excellent to work with and communicated every step of the way.

476,"October 17, 2018","When I first started looking for a car, I narrowed my search to the Audi A3 e-tron sportback due to the style and the availability for the HOV sticker as a plug-in hybrid. My search for a dealership began through the typical online searches that had different options with multiple dealership. My credit union also had a relationship with TruCar which connected me to a few dealership, including Walter's Audi. I was immediately contacted by multiple dealership within the next day and was initially contacted by Jessica Kohl from Walter's Audi who inquired about some specifics of what I was looking for and my price. She then forwarded me to her lead Internet Sales rep, Brett McKinley and we had further back in forth over the next few days via e-mail where I was able to get very specific in exactly what I wanted and the specific priorities in the features I wanted for the price I wanted at. Although they didn't have exactly what I wanted on the lot, Brett was able to find a model with the features I wanted most at a price that I was comfortable at and beat other dealership that I was speaking with at the time as well from the inventory off the lot.

When it came to meet in person and test drive, I was met with Josh Rambow. I came after work as it was later in the evening Josh ended up staying after closing to assist me and get the deal done. He went over everything I had talked with Brett with and showed me the car and went over everything with me. He didn't try to upsell me on anything that I didn't want and went over the features and things I needed for my specific car. Although the specific trim and model was not at the lot yet, we were able to finalize the deal and he personally drove the car to my home so I didn't have to deal with that IE traffic.

Overall, a smooth and pleasant experience with the purchase of my A3 e-tron.",5.0

492,"October 09, 2018","I didn't appreciate the treatment I got from one of their sales reps - one Mr. Morales. I had simply and politely asked if he would talk to me about pricing via emails. I am physically impaired and on the cusp of having a major back surgery which will require three months of recovery. Both for the comfort an Audi provides, and the performance of the sporty Q7 3.0, I thought the anticipation of driving this SUV, post surgery, would lend itself to my recovery quite nicely. Beginning the last leg of my long career as a minister, I was also enamored by the notion of providing my long-suffering wife a sort of sybaritic token of appreciation for her faithfulness to me in spite of our simple lifestyle, thus far marked by the deliberate avoidance of luxury and ease. 

Unfortunately, the response I got to my simple request was negative - chalk it up to ""company policy,"" the first email read. I politely responded with:

""I hope that's not the case, but if so, I appreciate your help. Thanks again. ""

The next response was curt and dismissive: 

""That is the case. So call me if you change your mind.""  

So imagine my surprise when a salesperson from Walters Ontario advised me that I had been mislead:

""I am sorry to hear you were told that Terry, that is not correct info. I would love to talk pricing before you get down here to make the process fast and seamless. What is the best offer you have received? Let me see if I can beat it. ""
 
The only logical conclusion was that Mr. Morales did not want/need my business - a determination I passed on to a Ms Kenisha, also of Walters Riverside, when she inquired as to why I had stopped communicating. 

This produced a, seemingly, contrite screed from Mr. Morales, but which also contained false impressions about my pricing preferences that were based on a second-hand conversation he, apparently,  had with his manager. The email also requested my absolute, non-negotiable criteria so he could ""check the inventory."" I responded with four stipulations: black, 3.0, premium plus, and 2018 pre-owned. 

Mr. Morales sent me back one result . . . white. 

This wouldn't have been so annoying if I hadn't already found THREE other vehicles online that matched all my prerequisites from the Walters Auto group's own stock! The very dealer's stock Mr. Morales claimed to represent! 

And if that wasn't enough, I explained this to him and sent him an example of what I had found which was more affordable, fewer miles and - did I mention - met ALL my criteria. 

You would think, at this point, it couldn't get more ridiculous. Well . . . you'd be wrong. In Mr. Morales' endorphin overloaded hubris, he had the temerity to blame me in an email dripping with condescension: 

""Are we switching criteria again? What you sent me is a Premium. Are we okay with Premium now or do you still want a Premium Plus?""

First of all, what does ""again"" mean? I have only had, from day one, a single list of criteria and that list was clearly stated once and only once. Any criteria Mr. Morales assumed he had, could have only come from a second-hand source, and even that source was guessing because I had, up to that point, not been asked. 

Secondly, he was clearly and demonstrably wrong. The fact that I had to send him a screenshot OF HIS OWN CAR - which read in capital letters at the top of the ad ""2018 Q7 3.0 PREMIUM PLUS"" - killed any and all credibility for Mr. Morales that remained. 

Hours later, while surfing through my undisclosed list of Audi's which I had culled from the internet weeks before, I noticed that several of the VINs had dropped in price. Curiously, all the Walter's Auto Pre-Owned 2018, Premium Plus, 3.0, Black, Q7's - the three that perfectly met the requirements I provided Mr. Morales ""to better serve me"" but that he had yet to offer - had gone up in price. One as much as $2,000. 

At that precise moment I began to laugh at the absurdity of it all. I had been duped. I had come in earnest, but I had failed to avoid the cesspool of profiteering, bent sales reps, and stereotypical used-car chicanery.",1.0

Once we expanded our search, we found Marcos Morales at Walter's Audi in Riverside who went SO FAR BEYOND what any salesperson has done in the past. He was AMAZING start to finish and truly understands that this is a SERVICE oriented business and you have to LISTEN to what the customer wants, not TELL them. He did a personalized video of the vehicle we were interested in. He answered EVERY question we had in a quick and courteous fashion. He was professional and LISTENED (note to other dealerships we did NOT buy from: YOU listen to US, not the other way around!) to our needs, and we drove over 350 miles to get this car, bypassing a lot of dealerships along the way! Just a great experience buying a car from Walter's Audi and Marcos Morales.",5.0
522,"September 22, 2018","I bought a new 2018 Audi A5 sportback yesterday.  It was my 5th Audi overall, and second one that I currently still have in the household.  This was my first time at this particular dealership, since I just moved to the area.  

The dealership/showroom is somewhat smaller than what I am used to for Audi, but their selection is still wonderful, and the atmosphere brilliant.  To point out the negative, the only reason I have given the dealership a 4, instead of a perfext score, is due to the lack of an on-site insurance agent.  At my previous dealerships, there has usually been at least one on-site insurance agent/agency, who could take care of that for me on the spot.  This is not a huge deal, if you already have a car with a policy, as you can just call your agent and add or switch to the car you just bought.  However, being new to the state, and needing a new policy, it would have been nice to have that available.

Now, for the positives, we were greeted at the door by Marcos, who took us to his desk and talked to us about what we wanted.  He found something quite close and took us on a test drive.  The only thing off was the color.  We wanted to have matching his/hers!  Now, he could have pushed us and tried to sell this to us.  He didn’t.  Instead, he searched the region and was able to find something pretty darn perfect at another location. 

Unfortunately, midway through our negotiations, he got a call and had an emergency he needed to go attend to, and he, very professionally, handed us off to Roman after filling him in on where we were.  Roman was nothing short of wonderful.  We put him through the ringer because our budget was somewhat short of our taste; can I get a witness?

Roman did All he could at his level.  Next, he got his manager, Mike, involved, who was very determined to help us, and did.  Finally, when we were pretty close to what we wanted, but still out of reach, the sales manager went to clear the final step with the general manager.  At this point, I wasn’t sure we were getting the car, because they had really done a lot already.  To my surprise, the GM Ok’d the deal and we got our new baby.  

We spent a little longer at the dealership than we wanted, after securing the deal.  They were having some computer/system issues, and we have to finish our Audi care another time because that system was down but overall, it was as nice an experience as buying a car ever is.  At the end, we were too tired and hungry to wait for the car to arrive from the other dealer.  Roman offered to personally pick me up from my house in the morning.  I didn’t make him do it, though.  We now consider this our home dealer.  Visit if you can.  Thanks for reading.",4.8

Audi took care of the front lic. plate after putting up a fight. I had to actually sent him the ordinance from CHP for them to install the front bracket. I also noticed that the all weather mats were missing so when i requested those Romen in a text replied if he has another used car he would give the one's in that car. He had the car i notices in their inventory but they backtracked on the promise. They offered me a $ 30 discount (hand out of sought) which I refused.

But the thing that really compelled me to go ahead and write this review is that he showed himself to be a man of honor by being true to his word.

The waiting area is nicely stocked with fresh coffee, pastries, fruit, bottled water along with secure wifi, a TV ... everything you'd expect from a service shop catering to high-end clientele.

670,"June 26, 2018","I had scheduled a visit on 6/1/18 for an appointment on 6/11/18 to have an open recall taken care of on my 2013 A6 3.0T (Fuel Line).  When I scheduled the appointment, I had also requested a loaner vehicle as well as to be notified of approximately how long the service should take (in case I didn't need the loaner).  Unfortunately, I was never notified prior to arriving for my appointment.  When I arrived (on time) for my 10:00 am appointment, I had to wait about 25 or so minutes before anyone was available to assist me as there seemed to be only one service manager on.  To be fair, I was acknowledged immediately and, while waiting, was offered something to drink by another employee who also continually apologized for the delay.

Once the service manager working the desk (Anthony Perez) was able to get to me, everything went fairly smoothly from there.  They had a loaner available for me as requested and got me back to my day as soon as they could.  My scheduled service manager, Stacy Samuel, did stay in touch with me throughout the day to let me know the status of my car and, of course, once my car was ready to go.

The best part of the entire visit was the multi-point inspection they completed as part of the service.  I should mention that I purchased the car from a very famous/popular used car lot (wbyceiydbo anyone?) where I have purchased many of my last few vehicles.  In any case, during this inspection, it was discovered that all four rotors were undersized for my car to a point where the brake pads weren't making a proper connection with them.  Also, they discovered that the motor mount was damaged and needed replacing.  Stacy sat down and reviewed each of these points with me in detail to ensure I understood exactly what the problems were, which was a nice touch.  Luckily I had just purchased the vehicle and was able to take it back to get the dealer I bought it from to fix it all.  Had Walter's not done the inspection and informed me of these items, I wouldn't have known.

Anyway, overall, I am very pleased with Walter's and the team in Riverside and will continue to go back for any/all of my future service needs.",5.0

They presented me with a fair deal that gave me what I wanted and within the budget I wanted. Recommend them if you are looking for a great sales experience.

I went to Lexus dealer next door first and test drove their 2018 Lexus RX SUV,  I look at a deal and test drove their famous Lexus  and could not make a decision on their ruff-ridding SUV because I had not test driven the Audi yet.  So after spending many hours getting bounced around from the salesman at Lexus dealer to several other managers. I told them I needed to test drive the Q7 first. They conceded and said please go next door a drive the Audi.   So I did !   I ask for Tamas Pinter and went to the vehicle I had called about. working with Mr.Tamas Pinter was indeed a pleasure ! He went over the Q7 options and features. You could tell the comfort and quality of the Q7 instantly. most important was the professionalism of Mr. Tamas Pinter that took me from the begging of the  Purchase experience to end without other interferences.  After the Purchase and finance office Mr. Printer took me on another per-delivery instruction and went over the features again.

 I'm very satisfied with Mr. Tamas Pinter well as Angel and Finance dept.. I highly recommend this dealer, their salesperson, and of course the Q7 that the Lexus dealers salesman recommended that I test drive...

Upon arrival we were greeted by salesperson, Phillip Braun, who was very friendly & professional. We purchased the truck and the process was fairly quick.

733,"June 01, 2018","My first time buying an Audi.  And it was the best Dealer experience my family and I had ever experienced!
First off, our salesperson Joshua Rambow was great, 5 stars or more if possible!  He was very professional, knowledgeable and very helpful during our visit at Walters Audi in Riverside.
I spent about two weeks working with him on getting the best price possible on my 2018 A5 Sportback.  He was able to beat the “best price” of all Audi Dealers from the surrounding areas.  He was very patient with me during the negotiating process.
He was up front with the “Out the door price” and did not hesitate to make sure he got our business. He definitely earned our business and will not hesitate to purchase from him again on our next Audi purchase.
Special thanks to his partner Isaac Ordinola who also assisted us when Joshua was off work or busy with another customer.  Isaac’s  “She’s here” video/email when the car arrived at their lot was great!  Cool to see the car was still wrapped and covered, new and looking gorgeous.  =)
Special thanks also to Andy Bartoli who made the ""signing"" of the papers fast and stress free.
Lastly, I also wanted to thank you guys for staying well over 30 minutes past closing time to help me.
Great job guys and well done on making a very satisfied customer!

After driving 3 hours to Walters Audi, I was informed that the vehicle I drove up to see had already been sold (even though I called an hour prior to my arrival and was told everything was on track). I was extremely disappointed however the staff at Walter's Audi made every attempt to assist me in finding a similar vehicle. I was extremely lucky and they were able find me a very similar vehicle w/ the assistance of the manager Mr. Ortiz and sales rep Mr. Artalejo. I waited approximately 2 and half hours for finance which was way below what I expect from an Audi dealership. I understand that it was a busy memorial day weekend but one finance officer was not nearly enough. Ultimately the amenities (free water and pop corn) were sub standard compared to other Audi dealers and were found lacking.

824,"March 27, 2018","I was on the hunt for a good three months until stumbling upon a car that caught my eye.  It was the right price, color, lower mileage, only one previous owner, etc.  I put in an inquiry and was contacted by Javier Orozco.  He let me know the vehicle was still available and to come on in for a test drive.  I had to go to New York for a few days so I had to decline.  When I returned to town Javier contacted me again telling me the car was still available and even sent me a personal video giving me a 360-degree live view of the car and its interior.  I set up a test drive for the weekend and when I came in (a few minutes early) Javier introduced himself.  He was finishing up with another client and asked if I would mind taking a test drive with one of his associates.  I agreed and was introduced to Marcos Morales.  He answered any questions I had about the car both during the inspection and test drive.  Once back at the dealership I wanted to get some financing options.  Marcos and I sat down, he input my information and gave me a few pricing options.  I wanted to think about the potential purchase over the rest of the weekend so I was on my way.  Monday morning I contacted Marcos and let him know I would be in to pick up the car.  A couple hours later Javier called me to see how my test drive with Marcos went.  I told him that it went very well and I would be in to purchase the car.  He was excited for me and sent me another personal video of the car.  When I came in to purchase the car I was welcomed by Javier and I spent a few more minutes with Marcos before I was introduced to Rob Little.  Rob went into depth about any additional questions I had, additional warranty/maintenance packages, AudiCare, etc.  I left that night with the car and was completely satisfied with the purchase.  Walter’s Audi has an excellent staff/team that made the process seamless.  Everyone I dealt with from reception to the three gentlemen who helped with my purchase was friendly, knowledgeable, and professional.  Not only will consider purchasing my next vehicle there, I would highly recommend Walter’s Audi to anybody looking to purchase a vehicle.",5.0

855,"March 06, 2018","I purchased a used car over a week ago and have been leaving messages and sending emails to try to get some assistance in a part that is missing on my vehicle. I also was told I could get financing through my own bank and get recontracted, which I did but my contract already went through by the time someone returned my fourth message, four days later. I am now stuck with a high interest rate until I can refinance, which was not explained to me that this was the case prior to me
walking away with the vehicle. Rob little eventually called me to tell me that it is no longer possible to be financed through my own bank. However, my sales associate Steve Morrison still hasn’t returned my messages about the missing part and at this point, it’s obvious that I will not be hearing from him and that customer service after the sale of the vehicle is no longer a priority at this dealership.

858,"March 04, 2018","I literally searched Audi dealerships across the country for a specific model. From his first email, Joshua Rambow was already laying his cards on the table with not only a price quote, but one that was well below any other dealer's.  The car at Riverside actually had more features than I was looking for but not all the right features I was looking for. With the initial email, Joshua recorded a custom video for me showing the car and its features. It was so thoughtful, I wished this was the car that I wanted. I kept a dialogue with Josh and continued searching. I found the car I was looking for at another dealer and got them to agree to a price similar to Josh's - note that this car had less overall features so Josh's price was still better. The guy there was intermittently responsive and didn't answer the exact questions I asked: this was the common response I would get from other dealerships.

I went back to Josh and asked for a list of all charges I could expect on my bill of sale. Without one question or interjection, he responded with all costs, tax, title, and fees, itinerized. He had built up so much trust that I only wanted to buy a car from him. Dealing with someone I trust was ultimately more important than having all the exact features I wanted. When I ultimately purchased the car from Josh, all prices and charges, included interest rate, were exactly as we had previously discussed. There were no surprises. I later found out that Josh's goal is to make the car-buying process as painless as possible. He succeeded.",5.0

Walter's Audi was like coming home for the holidays. We were welcomed and given a top notch tour of the facility and an introduction to all the employees personally. This was not only comforting, but it immediately made us feel like family. I did my research and found that the Q5 was the car for us. Your sales and finance group, in particular, Christy Matthews created an environment consisting of equipment knowledge , a safe space for negotiations without all the pressure/time numbing purchase of a vehicle. It was our pleasure to be part of Walter’s Audi’s professional environment.",5.0

Isaac Ordinola followed that up and we had a deal in 36 hours.  I added a tow hitch, cargo mat, car cover and Lojack to my car on top of the negotiated price.  Isaac called and emailed me several times throughout this process.  Without prompting by me, Isaac sent me a video of the car.  That was a good selling point and unexpected.  In the video he confirmed an option that I wanted was already on the car.  I wired the money and the car will soon be delivered to me for $400 - a fair price.  I looked forward to driving my new car.",5.0

When it was time to get a new car, I didn't hesitate.  I was introduced to Steve Morrison and purchased an A7 last Friday night.  He didn't push, didn't posture, just - like Stacy and Alex - made suggestions, and took what is sometimes a lengthy process and made it nice and easy.

I wouldn't hesitate recommending Stacy, Alex, and Steve, and I look forward to doing business with them for many years.

Monday, I felt like a VIP as I picked up my A4 from Walter's Audi following a regular service appointment this past weekend. 
The service team led by Mike Orosco, all on duty this past Saturday greeted me with friendly smiles and a ""take care of everything vibe."" They proved to me that my business matters to them, not that I was just another service order, standing in the way of them leaving for the day.
The courtesy and professionalism that Mike and his team extended to me is an example of the model that each Audi Dealership should hold as their standard. When you go to Walter's Audi for service, request Mike Orosco, and if you have any further questions, feel free to contact me and ask.
The icing on the cake is when the General Manager comes to talk with you about your experience.  It was great to meet Jon Kienle who complimented my A4 with the aftermarket S4 grille even though it still had window stickers from a competing dealership,

910,"January 19, 2018","This is the second time in 6 months that we have purchased a car from Walter's Audi in Riverside. The first experience was horrible (waiting an hour for a loaner car that we had pre-scheduled, an unnecessary 2-hour trip to the DMV because we were new to California and they led us wrong about how to get our car registered, a condescending finance person, the list goes on). We only went back because we were purchasing a used car that is hard to find. However, this second experience was MUCH improved. I'm giving the average of the 1 and 5-star ratings across the two experiences. This time, Tamas Pinter kept things efficient, we felt we were more fairly treated, and the finance person, Andrew, offered good service. I really appreciated that Tamas had a pleasant attitude throughout the sale, gave us space to make the decision, and did not pressure us. Additionally, the car was missing an accessory that we wanted/needed, and Tamas arranged for it to be ordered and shipped directly to us so that we did not have to return to the dealership--that was much appreciated.

968,"December 17, 2017","Purchasing a vehicle can be a very overwhelming experience, especially since it is such a large investment.  What initially drew us to this dealership was the value of the vehicles they had listed.  When we made our appointment, it was nice that Todd Bellis, the sales specialist, emailed me with a video of the car.  At our appointment we were greeted and assisted by Todd throughout the process.  He was very thorough with his explanations of all the vehicle's functions.  There was so much that the Audi had to offer and it was somewhat overwhelming to take in all the information, but Todd was very patient and informative.  The finance manager, Rob, was not pushy with selling different packages.   Rather, he were very informative and let us decide what to purchase.  Although lengthy, the experience was great!",5.0

He took the time to inquire and find exactly what we wanted and was not pushy at all.   Before we came down to Walter's Audi, he continually kept us updated with texts and even a short video which he introduced himself, as to when the car was going to be on the lot.  He was kind enough to always answer our questions and even took pictures of the car to make sure it was what we had asked for.  As we drove onto the lot Isaac was waiting there to greet us and took all the time we needed to go over the car and the paper work was done in no time at all.   He then explained everything about the car, test drove it with us and continued to make sure we knew how everything worked and took all the time we needed.

There are many functions to the system and Todd patiently explained in terms I could understand. His knowledge of these cars is second nature.

My experience with Walter's Audi was great from the start to finish. I contacted the dealership through their website about a couple of vehicles I was interested in. They responded right away. I wanted to speak to a sales person and Todd, a salesman, took my call, even when he was off of work. Our conversation about the vehicles I had expressed interest in felt very genuine and honest. He was not pushy about getting me in for a test drive like most dealerships, but instead let me contact him at my leisure. When I did go in for my visit, he verified the mileage and the VIN to ensure I was looking at the exact cars I told them I wanted to look at. After the test drive we sat down to talk numbers. Again, Todd was very honest and tried to get me the best deal. I never felt too pressured to close the deal. We quickly settled on a great price and signed away. Everyone at the dealership was very friendly, including Rob, the finance manager. Within 3 hours of arriving at the dealership I was driving off in my new car. Thanks again to Walter's Audi, I am extremely satisfied with my vehicle and car buying experience. If you need an Audi, come to Walter's and seek out Todd. A great salesman and a great guy.

1049,"September 21, 2017","BEWARE BUYING FROM WALTERS AUDI...  I'm disappointed that It's come to me writing this review.  I've given Walters Audi ample times to rectify the issues, and feel completely taken advantage of.  On August 25th, 2017, my husband and I purchased a brand new 2018 Audi Q5––on the way home from the lot a service light came on.  Our brand new car has been in the service department with numerous malfunctions more days then in our possession.  Steering wheel malfunction, rear hatch sensor not working, navigation screen black/frozen, garage door sensor not working, trim piece fell off twice, the list goes on and on...  The car was in the service department for SIX days straight, and after only having it back one day, another malfunction––back in the shop for SEVEN more days.  Our sales rep was Isaac Ordinola; we bought the car without questioning the price or even seeing the actual car.  We trusted he knew exactly what we wanted after we went over the specifications numerous times.  He could not find us a white car with all the options we were looking for ""in all of California"". We ended up with another color but he failed to say it was a lower model with less options. Not only did we receive a defective car, but it was not even the one we thought we were purchasing.  We immediately started calling and emailing Isaac Ordinola, the general manager Jon Kienle, Dan, etc... and have received NO RETURN CALLS NOR EMAILS.   As of today September 21, 2017 we have no answers... To add insult to injury we do not even have the spare key, which they have promised to on six separate occasions to ""overnight immediately"".  We felt it was only fair to replace the car, but quite honestly it has been such a headache and I'm not sure I even want an Audi anymore.  ",1.4

Initially, I wanted to handle most of the business through online and Joshua and Jennifer from Internet Sales were great with the response but realized I needed to at least make a visit to the dealership once.  

So after setting my expectations that the whole experience is going to be terrible again, I was pleasantly surprised after working with Issac Ordinola, who sure made the buying experience smooth and painless! After test driving the Q5, I was convinced that Q5 was the car I was going to buy.  Issac was very patience and polite to answer any of my questions and concerns.

1092,"July 28, 2017","So I was looking for an A5 coupe with all the right features that I wanted, literally emailed every single Audi dealer in Southern California (No joke) for pricing/ lease/ options etc etc. 

A lot of them took at least a day to respond, but I got an email from Josh Rambow within 10 minutes of sending an inquiring, I told him I wanted 25k miles on the lease per year (I commute a lot for work) and he didn't question it or try to sell me on other things; just a straight forward quote. A++ for responsiveness!
We emailed back and forth a couple of times on email to try to figure out pricing when I just figured it was at a decent price to come in and seal the deal. 
Turned out Josh was at training that day but Brett McKinley who was the other internet manager ended up helping me out in person. Going there I obviously was a little on guard with the whole aggressive salesmen perception in my head, but Brett was super laid back the entire time. He didn't give any overbearing or pushy presence when looking at cars with him. He let me look at the cars, mentioned some distinct items about them and allowed me time to walk around a little and check them out. When it came to negotiations it literally look maybe 5 minutes. Price was already somewhat determined with the emails from Josh; and Brett helped seal the deal in person. He showed us the dealer invoice price on the spot and it was obvious the pricing was fair both sides, none of the back and forth nonsense other people try doing for a couple hundred bucks. Another A++ for negotiations!
We wrapped up with signing the typical papers which were prepared ahead of time while I waited in the lobby and had some free food (who doesn’t like free stuff, right? :D ) 
Even though the drive was a little far away, it was well worth it. Both Josh and Brett were really helpful with their respective parts. The fast response from Josh caught the attention while Brett helped seal the deal in person; honest and genuine people who I'd definitely recommend to anyone.

1116,"June 20, 2017","Let me begin by describing my car experience lading up to meeting Isaac at Walter Audi.
I was in the market for a new vehicle as i was tired of driving a gas guzzling V6 that I literally did not fit in. 
After much enternet browsing I was able to narrow my search to three Subaru Leagcys. Iftee doing all my homework I was ready to go view the cars.  Day of the week was a Thursday.  First dealer dealership- dealership X had a Ltd Legacy silver that caught  my eye and was in very good condition. I arrived early and the salesmen on time at 0900. No big deal but I'd  figure if you knew we were meeting the car would be ready for me, more on that later. No one really greeted me, offered any drinks, nor was the salesmen present. I think I was offered water at one point but basically just helped myself.  I was earlier than him. We took our test drive went over the car and the car was excellent.  Once inside and talking about numbers that's when things changed.  I told them I don't want your add in and add ons which seemed to upset them. They treated me like a walking sack of money. They didn't want to make a deal, or get a good price. They even lied stating the price on the internet was a mistake. So the dealership 80 miles away purposely made the same mistake?  So they lie to my face.  This upset me, and promted me to walk out. 

Dealership Y same day several hours later. Began with no one greeting me, no amenities for my family.  Best of all the vehicle we were here to see, had its side mirror broken off!
We humored the idea any way and viewed the car. Upon further inspection I found extensive hail damage throughout the exterior. The interior smelled of smoke, and the overall quality was very poor. I walked away immediately and began searching elsewhere.

Last but not least, I went home that night for more research feeling bummed about the days experience.  I extended my search radius and found Walters Audi with a silver Subaru Ltd Legacy.  I figured why not, But at the same time it made me nervous. Audi's are very nice cars. Allow me to list the my experience.

*Contacted internet sales, greated by Isaac who is very friendly answers all my questions and sets a time for us to meet that day.

*I asked for a few more photos, Isaac immediately went to the car and began working on the photos texting me back right away. 

* without even asking Isaac went out into the heat and performed and instant video of the car from the inside out. Being very detailed not hiding anything. 

*Isaac gave me a fair final price  think about while I drove to riverside.  and called me for my well being and seemed genuinely concerned about our safe travel to meet him.

* upon arrival, instantly greeted, by another salesmen not pushy. The car was cleaned and already sitting out side ready to be viewed and close to the access door. Isaac came out to meet with us. Isaac was very easy to get along with very laid back yet professional. 
He was well prepared havin the key ready.

* while answering questions he didn't know he looked it up or found the answers. never said I don't know. Instead said I can get it for you. We then were greeted by Mike who was just as friendly and nice. He offered waters, snacks, shade, made offers to go to the gas station for energy drinks. Very sharp guy. 

*test drove inspected the car the price was right and decided to close the deal. We never felt rushed, it truly felt as though Isaac and Mike we're there to serve us. It was a new experience for me. They were warm and welcoming in their speech. 

*not to forget closing the deal with Jose Padilla who was a pleasure to work with. He was not pushy in his offering of any other ad in or warranties. He demeaned very professional throughout the experience. Very happy with our purchase.

Isaac's way of providing sales service is vastly different than any of the other cookie cutter dealships that I have been too. Walters Audi and with Isaac and mike is a the preferred choice. 

I highly recommend anyone in the market for a used car to head to Walters Audi and meet with Isaac for a truly one of a kind sales service.",4.6

Plus, I wanted to establish a sincere relationship with a dealer that reflects integrity, quality, and a commitment for the “long haul.”  I found that and more with Walter’s and specifically as represented in Marcos Morales, one of their new sales consultants.  Marcos exhibits a combination of maturity and youthful energy that is refreshing, engaging, and which fosters confidence in both Marcos and Walter’s Audi.  Also, he added special knowledge and suggestions that helped my wife and I to qualify that this was the best car for her, per our budget and per our long-term goals.  During the negotiation and closing process, which is one of the most stressful times for any buyer, except perhaps for buying a house, he was patient and relaxed, and obviously wanted a “win win “for BOTH Walter’s and for my family.  His professionalism helped gain our confidence that Walter’s will be there for us in ensuring my wife has as safe and as quality a driving experience as possible under our contract.  Not to mention, the team’s follow up has been great.  I recommend contacting Marcos and Walter’s if you are looking for a quality, durable car offered by an honest, polished, and knowledgeable family values dealer in the Inland Empire and Riverside County regions.  Marcos and Walter’s are free to have potential customers call me for a personal review.  Most Sincerely, Johnson Family, Inland Empire.  ",5.0

1126,"June 02, 2017","One of the more interesting things I’ve done involved obtaining a brand new Q5 from Walter’s Audi.

Let me explain:   

It was interesting because this was all done:

•	Initially via the Internet
•	Sight unseen
•	Without a test drive
•	From thousands of miles away

For various reasons, I required taking delivery of my Audi in Hawaii...2,500 miles away from Walter’s.  The entire transaction was accomplished with surprisingly few emails, telephone calls and Fedex-ing.  How could I feel so comfortable doing this?  Simple:

Brett McKinley.  Hands down he provided me with the best car buying experience!

Brett took my initial inquiry seriously and treated me with respect.  Though he had never sold a car for delivery in Hawaii before (he does have extensive experience with the rest of the 49 states, though) he was not deterred.  He became an excellent point of contact and helped me coordinate the delivery of my documents and ultimately, my car.  

Supporting Brett was the fantastic Walter’s team.  Together they helped me get behind the wheel of my new Audi!  

Much Aloha, and many thanks to Brett and the rest of the Walter’s team!  I plan on becoming a repeat customer.  

Definitely 5 stars.

1138,"May 20, 2017","Setup : (my bad experience with a prior Audi dealership) 
In the first week of April 2017 I got into a car accident and totaled my BMW 328i. Instead of going with another bimmer, I decided to try out Audi. I live in Anaheim, and went to the nearest Audi dealership, let's call them Dealer-x. At Dealer-x I test drove the Audi A4 Quattro with the Audi Virtual Cockpit etc., and loved it instantaneously. I had finalized on the A4, but they didn't have a car in the color(s) of my choice. They were able to find a car for me in the bay area but insisted to charge me a shipping fee. For a about a week, I would speak with different guys once in AM and once in PM, trying to negotiate the particulars, but I was never given anything concrete. When I asked them to send me an email with the final numbers in a lease vs finance scenario with a range or down payments, I was told that their e-mail systems were down... for a week.. I refuse to believe that any business in 2017 can afford a week's worth of IT downtime.

First Contact with Walter's Audi :
Last week I had to got Redlands, and noticed that Walter's Audi in on my route up. So i decided to call them, I was put thru to Isaac Ordinola. 

I explained to Isaac my situation, and told him I was looking for a very specific car with the Audi Virtual Cockpit in the specific color options. He made sure he understood what is it that I wanted, and me they had cars in the inventory for me. I also asked Isaac to wave off the extra charges for the ""Audi Care"" package (which allows me to service the car for my lease period). He was able to get me that.

Instead of sending me links or stock pictures, Isaac sent me a 10~15 sec video of the car that they had lined up for me. I thought that was a good touch.

Before my appointment, the car that was lined up for me was sold. Isaac was prompt enough to text me prior to the appt that the car had been sold, but they had a couple cars which fit my requirements.

The car that i ended up test driving was a ""Monsoon Grey"" A4 with the packages i wanted. I still wasn't too excited about the color grey. And after taking up about 3.5 hrs to make a decision, i decided against the grey. Isaac and his manager were able to find a Black on Black for me. I ended up test driving that car and eventually leasing. 

Positive feedback for Isaac Ordinola :
* He actually took an interest in what my schedule was like, and worked with me to find suitable timings and logistics.I really liked the fact that he was trying to work with me to find what I wanted, as opposed to trying to guess how much money do I have to spend, and stick me with something.

* As I had totaled my car, I was in a rental car. So on the day of picking up the new car, I would've had 2 cars. Isaac offered to drive my rental car from Riverside down to Anaheim. So that I would be able to drive in a rental car and drive out with the new A4 :) 

* He was able to treat my refusal to budge on my color preference with respect. As a matter of fact he encouraged me to ask more questions.

* As a young Indian guy walking into a german car dealership, I've had sales people tell me, ""you don;t look like a guy who is going to walk out with a new car today. Why don't we discuss everything when you're ready to pull the trigger?"" My experience with Isaac was completely the opposite. He was friendly, accommodating and also gave me few insights on what options would be beneficial for me. He even helped me find things to do in Redlands :P

* I really liked this guy's style of car sales which is unlike the typical high pressure sales guy thing. 

* My experience with the finance person, Jose Padilla was also very good. He was not trying to push any of the added on packages on me. He too was able to understand my driving requirements and situations and was able to make right recommendations.

All in all, I really enjoyed the whole ""car buyer experience"" at Walter's Audi. It is a little bit of drive to get to Riverside, but I can tell that these people understand that fact and will put in the extra effort to make it worth the while.",4.8

Jose Padilla wrapped up the financial part of the deal. He too was personable, and accommodating. He was informative and honest regarding additional service packages.

On arrival, Stacy Samuel jumped right into the paperwork and worked with the techs to get my car in ASAP- all while still juggling the phones and assisting other customers.  As luck would have it, the techs ended up running into an issue during the swap which forced them to stay over an hour late.  Stacy and the tire team went well above and beyond, and the service provided was exceptional in all regards.  It was entirely unrealistic to expect a tire mount and balance in 20 minutes, but they stepped up and accepted the challenge anyway.  They refused to accept any gratuity, and even insisted on still running the car through the wash (she needed it).  What could have been a huge headache for me ended up being relatively quick and painless, and thanks to Stacy and the shop now I won't be worrying about my car all weekend.  The team at Walter's Audi was enthusiastic and responsive, and I will not hesitate to return in the future... hopefully for scheduled maintenance this time!",5.0

1175,"February 27, 2017","A transparent negotiation and buying process from Brett McKinley at Walter’s Audi when my wife bought her car is the reason why I came back to buy a second Audi for myself. 

I had taken in my wife’s Audi for its 1st scheduled maintenance and was looking at the Audi’s in the showroom while I waited. I hadn’t considered buying an Audi for myself, and had been looking at either a V-series Cadillac or waiting for the right used GTR to purchase. Since I am tall, an important criteria was that I fit in the car. This was why a new Miata was out of the question or a C7, since both didn’t provide enough headroom. Walter’s had a TTS in the showroom and when I sat in it, I realized that the Audi TT interior is deceptively spacious and this was the car meant for me. Fast forward to a month later, I noticed that Walter’s had sold that TTS in the showroom, but before I went looking at other dealerships, I called Brett and asked if he could get another one….and he could.

During the buying process, all of the financing options were clearly laid out to help make an educated decision. While the paperwork was getting ready, I had coffee and a bagel in their waiting room. They washed and detailed the car and I was in/out from start to finish is just a couple of hours. Most of the time was waiting for the car to be detailed after I had signed the paperwork and car washes are free whenever I stop in. In the end, I was very happy with the purchasing process and the level of service provided. ",5.0

During this 4 month period. Brett continued to communicate with me about my order and delivery time frame.  He always replied and returned phone calls in a timely manner.  He called to let me know it was here earlier than expected. I was so excited. It was perfect and I loved everything about it. Brett was detailed in showing me how everything worked. I truly couldn't ask for a better and more thorough sales person than Brett.

I had the pleasure of getting to work with Jose Padilla in finance! He was honest, answered all my questions. Gave advice from his personal experience of purchasing/ leasing which was helpful!

We took it for a test drive where David explained all the features and benefits. At the end of the test drive we told David that we would like to sleep on it before making the decision. He was very understanding and did not pressure us at all. He let us know he would be there the following day. 
We came back and David's service was still exceptional. He simply asked questions, listened, and was a complete advocate for us. We never once felt pressured or just another sale. He made us feel like family. He never once tried to deter from our wants and needs. He was patient, kind, genuine, and knowledgable. You can tell he prides himself on his service and reputation.

1355,"August 09, 2016","I have purchased my Audi E-Tron from Walters Audi.    Dan Ebach was the sales professional that sold me my car.  

Dan was the most professional car sales person I’ve ever dealt with when it came to buying the car.  (In my life I purchased over 10 cars so and have dealt with many different sales people and car dealers.) The process was very simple, there was no haggling involved they just gave me the bottom price.  Everything was easily arranged with a few phone calls and emails to confirm everything in writing. 

Dan was able to offer me the best price of any other dealer in Southern California. I know was the best price we other dealers told me I should just go buy the car from Walters. In addition, they were able to match the trade-in value of my car sight unseen that had to be towed to their lot for repairs.   Since my car was dead Dan pick me up bought me to the dealer to buy the car and arrange for a loaner car until ready for delivery. 

I would definitely recommend buying you Audi from Walters and working with Dan Ebach.  So far I have referred one friend to Dan he’s very happy with the entire buying experience

The Audi E-Tron is an amazing, fast, smart car I totally recommend that you check it out.   I was in love with this car was on my first test ride.  Since I do a lot of around town driving I go average of 600 miles before I have to put gas in the car.   How wonderful not to have to think about the price of gas anymore!

1371,"July 12, 2016","The first thing we look for whenever we deal with an type of customer service is the respect and consideration that is given to us from the beginning to the end of that transaction. I've literally walked out of places due to disrespectful/negative vibes coming from a customer service specialist. 

My wife and I had been searching for an Audi A3 2.0 for about a year and a half before we found the right car for her. A year before we had almost bought one from another dealership but right as we parked the car the check engine light came on. That wasn't what made us not buy the car. It was the fact that the sale person had told us not to worry and that it was probably nothing. I just can't deal with deal with someone that would try to play me like that. So we told them respectfully that we needed more time to think about it and decided that it was not the right time and car to get.

In comes Walter's Audi. The name Walter had already clicked with us since Walter is the man that brought my wife and I together lol. Then we walk in and not once did I feel any negative energy. Just open and smiling people. This actually means a lot to me as I like to build on relationships. It happened that the owner of the car, a 2015 Audi S3, was there as well and was able to answer all our questions. However, the main man that helped us was Richard. Very cheerful man that went above and beyond to get us set up into that S3 even though we were looking for an A3 2.0. Sometimes things just work out way. Funny right?

After the test drive, which was amazing by the way (292hp turbo), we went into his office and got down to business. The fun part hehe. How someone negotiates always shows me the type of character I am dealing with and I can whole heartily say that Richard gave as much as he took and that was seriously all I was looking for. I wasn't looking to pull a fast one on them and they weren't looking to pull a fast one on me. Even at the end he took care of all the thing I asked for. 

Then came finance and just wow. The fastest process I have ever been apart of. In, asked if I wanted any options, said no, no up sell, signed the papers and out. Fastest process ever! 

We drove away with more than we even wanted at a great price and made a friend along the way. We still hit up Richard with any question we have and he responds right away. Couldn't have asked for more. Thank you again Richard and I hope the best for your family and friends. Your positivity is really inspiring.",5.0

1378,"July 07, 2016","If the ""80/20 Rule,"" is applicable to everything, then 80% of employees go to work with ""just another day at their job"" attitude.  The remaining 20% go to their job with a mission in mind,  which is to be the best they can be on any given day.  Then you have the elite group of employees, probably only 3%, the ones who lead the pack in a world of followers.  That's who I had the pleasure and satisfaction of having provided me service for my A6.  I love my A6, it is everything that I hoped for and expected when I bought it at Walter's.  And when it needs attention, encountering expert, professional, and superb service is always a welcomed bonus!  Although I had a communication breakdown initially with Mr. Juarez, which was highly unusual, Javier was quick to redeem himself and remedy the problem with stellar service and attentiveness.  It takes a true professional to apologize and then compensate his oversight by having my car completely detailed at no charge.

convertible at Walter's Audi. There were no pictures since they 
just received the car as a trade in. I called the sales office and they 
connected me to Rob Cardenas. He said the car was being detailed
and he would take a video and send it to me as soon as they were
done. Within a couples hours Rob sent me the video and then called
to see if I would like to see the car. I made an appointment with
him to see it on Saturday morning. Rob was there to greet us when 
we arrived. He took my wife and I on a separate test drive while 
our six year old son was watching a video in their waiting area. Rob
was very courteous and professional. He did not put any pressure on
us to buy the car. We gave him our top price that we would pay for 
the car. Rob worked with us on the price but could not get to the
price we offered. So we left without the car. On Monday I got a 
call from Tawni Heffner, she said the sales manager had agreed 
agreed to our price, and Rob would be giving us a call. My wife 
and I met Rob at the dealership Monday evening. He had the car
all cleaned up and the paperwork ready to sign. We got a great deal,

The prior owner had given the dealership only one key. Rob said she
called him after she found the extra key. Rob mailed the key to us as

care of you.

  Dan Ebach from the start took the time out to understand our needs (had a unique situation) and tried to work with us without asking for the deal. He knew we had shopped other places and truly wanted to knock out all the haggling over price. It took a few days and never once did we feel pressured to buy a car.

My husband and I stopped in on a whim because we happened to be in the area. We parked, got out to look at a few cars nearby, and were soon greeted by Brett. He was beyond friendly, engaging, relaxed, and not at all pushy. He answered all of our questions and was focused on my interest only (s5). He gave us time to explore the car inside and out after which we went into the office to go over some numbers. After discussing different lease scenarios we expressed wanting time to think it over a bit. We took a drive to think things through and returned 30 minutes later with the desire to proceed with the transaction.

Again Brett was friendly, accommodating, and took us through the process with ease. I was able to get the car at a price within the fair market range. 

The rest of the process was a breeze. Jose Padilla wrapped up the financial part of the deal. He too was personable, and accommodating. He was informative and honest regarding additional service packages.

We were not looking forward to the search, due to high pressure from sales people, etc.  After searching the Internet, we saw a 2013 Audi A4 that we wanted to check out at Walter’s Audi of Riverside (we live in Orange County).  
Robert Cardenas (our sales agent who is new to the dealership) was very happy to answer any questions we had – if he did not know the answer, he would check with managers to find out the answer.  
Needless to say, our granddaughter fell in love with the A4.  As the dealership just received the car, we could not drive off with the car until  the car was thoroughly checked out (we appreciated that safety gesture very much).  After waiting a few days for delivery, Robert drove the Audi A4 from Riverside to our home in Orange County (a 45 minute drive in good traffic) with a full tank of gas.  The car arrived in immaculate condition and upon taking the A4 for a test drive, Robert explained the various features of the Audi A4.  Needless to say our granddaughter loves the A4 and is out there every day cleaning off any dirt she put on the car in the drive to and from school.  
Robert and the staff at Walter’s Audi did a great job answering any questions and getting the car ready for delivery.   Best of all, there was no high-pressure from anyone at Walter’s to purchase the car.  Robert also made a follow-up call to us (after delivery) to see if we had any further questions regarding the vehicle.  We are also getting lots of positive feedback from family and friends and we would gladly recommend Robert Cardenas for any future inquiries.  Good Job Robert – Keep Up the Good Work!

My niece happen to check the car today and now that car was discounted by $1000 on the internet.  I called the Sales Mgr. and he told me that the sales amount was never change and the payment was always the same since the day we went it.  To make a long story short I am very disappointed with Walter's Audi.  I feel that the dealership was dishonest with us and tricky   They just want to get us back into the dealership and giving up the low payment without being upfront about the final sale price, the term of the new loan, the fees and payment....etc.  If this is a normal business practices for Walter's Dealership,  you can count me out as a customer.  This is not my first rodeo in dealing with new car purchase.  I own 2 porsche, mercedes, bmw....etc...and to think I was going next door to see about the new panamera my wife was interested in.  The whole process was very shady and unpleasant to me.  I will never want to deal with Walters dealership again nor I will refer any of my friends and family. IF you want to build a long lasting relationship with your clients', please be honest and upfront and make the client feels welcome...sometime everything is not about the price of the car,  it about how you would present it.  had we been disclose about all the pertinent information ,  your car would have been out of the lot already. Thank you very much..@sales mgr..it's absolutely OK to say hello to client when walking into the same room.",2.0

1463,"February 03, 2016","The Internet purchasing experience with Walter's Audi was outstanding.  The discount offered through Edmunds.com was very enticing and setting an appointment time was simple.  Brett McKinley did the best job explaining the A8L and left little for me to question.  Besides the Internet discount he found a 'bounty' discount for my Mercedes trade in and an additional discount for financing a portion of the purchase price.  Brett is the first sales representative that truly works for the buyer's benefit without any gimmick!

My wife and I bought the Audi the next day and it is a magnificent vehicle.  I heartily recommend Bret McKinley as the Internet Sales representative to contact at Walter's Audi in Riverside.  In my opinion you will not find a more sincere sales person.

1464,"February 03, 2016","When I first started looking for an A-5, we (My wife and I) happened to stop at a dealership out in the Palm Desert area.  We couldn't have been treated any more poorly. When I mentioned to the salesman that ""waited"" on us that I was in the market for an A-5, he basically blew me off by saying that they didn't have any and I should come back in a month. My wife and I proceeded to walk back to our car..........right past 3 A-5's. I was so livid that I called the manager the next day to tell him of our experience. He was apologetic, but knew exactly which salesman it was. I got the feeling that I was not the first customer this guy treated like dirt. So why again, does he still work there?

So, I went to Walter's and got great service right from the start. I had to special order one because of the color (red) and it took a few months to get it. It was well worth it. Brett McKinley kept me up to date on the status of my car. He was always available to answer any questions and made the experience a great one on every count. He went over the car with me in great detail, and made it clear that if I had any questions, he would be more than happy to answer them for me. The whole ""team"" at Walter's treated us like our business was important to them, not like an after thought. I would highly recommend both Walter's Audi and Brett McKinley.

I did my car shopping in both Riverside and in Elk Grove (Northern California) and I can honestly say that the sales approach at Walter's Audi is pleasantly superior and unique. Before we closed the deal, I told Eric that I would like to go home to think about the offer he made me. Rather than giving me the ""buy now or your car might be sold to someone else"" story, he encouraged me to make sure I feel like I am getting the best deal!! I returned about three hours later and purchased the stunning 2014 2.0T A5 coupe!

I worked with Andrew Bartoli to finance my A5. He did an awesome job at explaining all of the terms and options that I had without pushing anything on me. This was very important to me since I was a first time buyer and I was concerned that I wouldn't know enough to make good decisions in the finance office.

At all moments, before, during and after the deal, they have been professional, courteous, and went above and beyond to help me finally purchase the car of my dreams. Before even going into Walters Audi in person, I had a lady who called me a few times frim Walters and she also called to inform me that they would be one of the best places to get a vehicle from. A couple months after having to deal with some other places I have been stressing over, I found online a car that looked to suit me best and was at a reasonable price. I inquired about it online, and was invited to check it out the next day. I went in a littie earlier than anticipated , and was greeted by David. David was polite , courteous, professional, was helpful to understand the process , and even though the original day of Saturday that we couldn't get it done, was able to finish off the deal a couple days later . Finally , a car dealership that made sense to me. They didn't give me headaches, they didn't Bs me, they helped me achieve my overall goal to get a used, awesome vehicle at a fair price. Andrew in financial also was extremely helpful , courteous, and did everything he could to help me get the car of my dreams. It was a pleasure being able to work with Walters Audi. They made my Christmas and the end of this year special and helped me to put a smile on my face. Most of this year has been anything but smiles especially when it comes to my special woman who I haven't been able to see really since mid July this year.

And even though she is not listed on insurance or on the actual car itself, I am sure when she gets to come home, she will be added to the policy and car as well , since she is a deserving and loving woman who also gave me a chance when no one else would. It is for that reason also why I am rating Walters Audi with the highest marks. They basically did the same thing my lady did for me. Which was believing in me and loving me no matter what , and helping to put a smIle on my face when I didn't want to. Thanks",5.0

My mom was due for a new car and had mentioned the Audi Q5, so yesterday while I was at work I called Walters Audi to get a little information and set up a time to come in.  We drove to Walters this morning from AZ and within a few minutes we were greeted by Amin Eshaq.  When you think of a salesman, you think pushy, they want to up sell, they are in it to squeeze you for as much as possible;  not with Amin!  Like I said, my mother went in to look at the Q5, but it was little too big for her, so she sat in the Q3 and loved the feel.  Not once did Amin try to push the larger vehicle.  He told my mom that since its just her, my dad and their 3 little dogs, the Q3 would be just perfect for them.  He talked to her about the quattro system and front wheel drive models, technology packages and which package would be good for their area and lifestyle.  She was sold!  Amin took them into the office, had her BMW appraised, set everything up and in no time my mom was signing her new lease....I've got to tell you, I really was there just to see what was going on and check out cars with the family.  Amin did such a great job though, that he sold me on a Q5 that they had.  Within 45 minutes, I was done and signing papers!  When all was said and done Amin spent the next hour going over everything on my moms new car with her.  Setting up her phone, teaching her how to use all of the vehicle features, getting the WiFi set up...if you're looking for a vehicle and are worried about be hassled by a salesperson, don't!

1558,"November 29, 2015","This is the first time we have leased/purchased a new vehicle and were not excited about the experience. I called Walter's Audi because they were listed as a Costco Audi dealer.  On the phone, I was directed to Chuck Cerda.  I ordered a 2016 Audi A6 TDI , listed at $65,000,  He said that with Audi loyalty program, Costco discount,  and tradein, the lease payment would be around $450.  We were very impressed.  Because of the emission problems of the TDI, we decided not to purchase that car and Chuck said that they would make us a great deal on a gasoline model.  I found a car in inventory that was perfect.  It was listed at $69,000.  The lease payment they came up with was nearly $800 and they were offering $7,000 on our tradein.  KBB listed tradein at $10,000.  We should have walked away at that point, and wished that we had.  Angel worked hard to find a car that would fit our needs, we arrived at an acceptable lease rate.  The car was at the port so we drove our 2007 A8L home to Palm Desert to await delivery of the A6.  On the way home, we regreted not just walking away.  We could have, no doubt, made the same deal with Desert European Motors in Palm Desert.  We didn't feel the Costco discount was really impressive.  The good news is that our salesman, Syed Ali, was delightful and he delivered the car personally to Palm Desert.  We have put our disappointment behind us and the new car is superb.  This doesn't change our feeling about our experience.",3.0

I had an extended warranty through another company when I purchased the car, and Ronald was able to make a minor repair on a motor mount using that warranty.

He was friendly and helpful and went the extra mile to get a loaner car for me and even got me a discount on the service. Thank you for everything!

One item to note for improvement purposes: During my past couple of visits to Walter's, the service advisors have promised to follow up with me regarding the on-going progress of my car, and haven't. During the most recent trip, I received a text message from the dealership which said to save it into my phone in order to receive updates, but I didn't receive any. Both times, I had to follow up myself regarding the status of my vehicle and it was a little frustrating. So, follow-ups could use some improvement.

We have bought 4 new cars in the last 5 years and what a pleasure it was in buying a car form Walter's Audi. 

After we filled out the quick application on line Jennifer called us right away and was very friendly and answered all of our questions. We then spoke with Brett McKinley, probably one of the friendliest guys you will ever meet, a top notch salesman. Of course we all have reservation on going in and dealing with the haggling that goes along with buying a car and all I can say is how easy and simple they made the experience. Brett showed us several A5's and once my wife picked the one she wanted we were only in Brett's office about 10 minutes then we were off to sign paperwork :).  After the very short negotiation process we met Dana Clayton who made the final decision on the deal. What a class act he was. 
Then we were off to Finance where we  met Jose Padilla. Jose made the paperwork process relaxing and very smooth. He explained everything in detail and made us feel very comfortable. 
Well all we can say is that if you are in the market for a new car you would be doing yourselves a disservice if you did not give this dealership a chance. My wife and I had worked in the car dealership trade  for over 5 years  and this store is definitely not your average dealership.

Syed Ali was there when we needed him, let us test drive the car and answered all of our questions and gave us breathing room to discuss our auto buying position. We left and came back a few days later after deciding on the Audi Q5 and talked with Todd Bellis. The deal was made and we didn't have any high pressure from sales. He more inclined to let the car sell itself, which it did. The car was cleaned and the gas tanked filled.  We received a thorough demonstration of the cars technological features by Todd Bellis .We were taken to Service and we drove away happy.

However, Christian and Eric stayed and waited for us and even offered to help us set up or answer any other questions we might have had. We were all very taken aback by this gesture. I highly recommend these two to any family or friends!

Everyone that I came into contact with was friendly, highly competent, and professional.  When I called the service department last week with my concern, Coral was very attentive and thorough.  She was efficient in scheduling a convenient drop off date and reserved  a loaner vehicle for me. She also informed me that Javier Jaurez would be my pre-designated service attendant.  I could almost sence her smile over the phone.  Afterwards, she sent me confirmation of my appointment day and time.  Upon arriving early, Mr. Juarez was away from his desk.  Stacy jumped off her desk and introduced herself and attended to me. Immediately.  Her exceedingly friendly demeanor and willingness to assist me was impressive.  Once Javier joined us, Stacy  gave him an update of what we had discussed. I found Javier to be friendly, patient, and knowledgeable.   He listened with interest to my concerns regarding my vehicle and he addressed all  my questions, and explained everything very thoroughly. He then retrieve the loaner for me.   He demonstrated his patients while I had to  phone my insurance carrier to email him verification of my insurance coverage.  What was most impressive was the high degree of effort every staff put forth to ensure that this customer was treated friendly attentively, professionally, and competently regardless if the service appointment was a warranty service item or not.  In short I  left Walters Audi satisfied and with a smile.  Thank you  Walters Audi for making me feel as special as when I purchased my vehicle. Keep up the awesome work ethics in fulfilling your mission statement.  
Kudos to Dave Ranciglio for his genuine concern that I was treated friendly and that I left satisfied and with a smile. Not only did Mr. Ranciglio email me a follow inquiry, but he also followed up with the personal phone call. He left me a  very nice message which I greatly appreciate.  It is apparent to me that Mr. Ranciglio  leads by example and due to his leadership skills he had he has had a positive impact upon his department.",5.0

To top it off he was very patient throughout the process because I'm an indecisive buyer.

1636,"September 23, 2015","This past Saturday was a superb day for me at Walter's Audi dealership in Riverside.  There I met sales rep Eric Dawes.   He was knowledgeable and answered my questions regarding the different models and packages. We went for a test drive and he was able to  effectively explain all the features and the technology that the A6 offered. Upon returning to the parking lot, I found Eric to be passive in his approach which I appreciated since I was not prepared to make a purchase but rather I was just window shopping.   After the  preliminary talks, Eric then introduced me to Angel who negotiated the final details and was instrumental initiating the paperwork. Both of these gentlemen were accommodating and made me feel more like family than a customer.  Once we completed the paperwork I was then introduced to the finance manager, José Padilla.  I honestly didn't think that I would qualify for an auto loan.  Mr. Padilla was able to work a miracle and get me financed with Chase bank at a lower rate than I expected.  Meanwhile Eric was kind enough to fill my gas tank and had my car washed.  My 2012 A-6 looked brand new.  Before I departed Eric sat with me in my car for about another 30 minutes and explained all the technology features within my car. He programed my phone, music, and answered all my questions. The following day  Eric followed up with a call just to be certain that I had no questions to offered me future assistance. I also received a message from the service manager David who also welcomed me to Walter's Audi.  I was completely satisfied and thoroughly impressed with all the staff.  I found it to be a highly qualified dealership.  They were exceedingly knowledgeable, professional, friendly, and attentive to my individual circumstances.

1637,"September 23, 2015","I just bought a 2015 Audi A4 from Walter's Audi from Amin Eshaq and I could not have had a more amazing experience!! 

I came into Walter's a few weeks prior to buying mine to decide between the A3 and A4 and Amin test drove them both with me, asking me about what my personality and what my lifestyle is, what I would primarily be using my car for, etc., trying to gauge which car would be better suited to my style and my needs. We decided on the A4 and then it was just a matter of deciding what year, and if I was going to get a CPO or a new car. 

Amin was very knowledgeable in the pros and cons of each car type and whether to buy new or used. I never felt pressured or that he was just trying to sell me a car. I could tell that he genuinely cared about whether I was going to be happy with my decision.

By the time I came back to buy the car, it had sold that morning and I was visibly disappointed. Amin immediately started finding other cars that had the same features that I was looking for, and we ended up looking at a brand new Tornado Grey Metallic, Quattro A4 with navigation. When we test drove the car, I was in love. It was even better than the CPO I had originally wanted, and he gave me such an amazing offer I couldn't refuse.  

I am so grateful for Amin Eshaq's service and devotion to finding me a car that I will love for many years. He truly cared more about my happiness and satisfaction, than getting that car off the lot that day. I definitely recommend him to anyone and will be referring all of my friends and family to him.

     I own 3 cars (2 Porsches and 1 Audi) and I frequently hear about people avoiding dealerships because of perceived high costs. For me the truth is far from this. Walter's has, on two occasions now, solved problems with my Audi (2004 model) that others could not. Their prices are virtually the same as anywhere else and... they get it right! This is the most important thing to note. They also stand behind their work. Ron actually helped me with a very simple issue concerning my rear seat release that I was confused by.
     The prices on parts are actually cheaper than anywhere else if you are a member of their rewards program. They provided a beautiful loaner car too.
     What else can I say? If you own an expensive car and want it maintained correctly then just drop it off here and let them do their job. Audi and Porsche both are well served by Walter's.

Both the decision to purchase the A6 3.0T and to do business with Walter's Audi were relatively easy decisions.  No other car offered the combination of speed, convenience, and style, and yet the two dealerships located closer to my home almost caused me to purchase a Lexus GS350 instead.  That changed when I reached out to Walter's Audi and connected with Brett McKinley.  Brett was straightforward, responsive, helpful, and the decision as well as purchase process went very smooth... including the need to complete a dealer transfer to get the car I wanted.  There were no surprises with the terms & paperwork in Finance, the car was prepped and ready to go, and the whole experience was not only painless, but it was a pleasure.

1703,"June 17, 2014","One word is all it takes to write this review:  Perfection!  This place should be the model for how all car dealerships operate.  Came in to look at (and hopefully buy) an Audi Q7.  I contacted Mario Lopez via the internet first to ask about a certified preowned model that they had on the lot.  I got an immediate reply with all my questions answered and he got right to the bottom line on price (100% hassle free as it should be).  A few days later, my wife and I drove from San Dimas to Riverside (over 30 miles) to see the car and meet Mario (keep in mind there is another Audi dealership just minutes from my house).  We arrived at Walters pretty late on a Saturday afternoon and Mario was there to greet us as agreed.  We went out, had a look at the car, took a test drive and to be honest, my wife and I were not as impressed with this particular q7 as hoped.  We wanted a Q7, but this one was just not for us.  It was acting a little glitchy with some features despite Mario trying his his best to get it working right.  Now READ THIS all other dealerships...  Mario turned to me and and said ""this ones making me look bad today folks"".   No excuses, no BS.  Thats HONESTY.  These are very high tech vehicles and I of course understood things happen (it is preowned after all).  Anyone shopping for a car would much rather have a salesman take this approach vs some BS storyline to try and close a deal.  They had some other gorgeous CPO Q7s, so I asked Mario to show us a couple others that I had already previously seen on their website even though they were really above our price point.  We found the perfect one for us.  I really did not think one of these models would be possible due to the cost, but between Mario and Sales Manger Jon Kienle they worked with us and got it right to the price we needed.  By this time the dealership was getting ready to close, but we were never ever made to feel rushed.  Everyone took their time and were extremely helpful.

Next we were helped by Finance Manager Andy Bartoli and again other dealers should really take note.  The PERFECT model how the finance and paperwork process should go down.  He clearly explained everything and again right to the point with no games.  After we were done, Mario greeted us again with our new CPO Q7 all detailed and ready. Now even though it was well passed the dealership closing, he took the time to go through the car and all the features etc.  There is much to learn with these awesome vehicles, so Mario offered to come out to me in a week or two for a follow up to again go over the car, WOW, thats service!  If you are looking for a new or used Audi, these guys and gals are the place to go.  I don't care if you live in Santa Barbara or San Diego, take the drive (besides you will have so much fun driving home in your new Audi, you will be happy you did).  Thank you to Walters team.  We will be back :-)",5.0

As we got there I asked for Mr. Jay Baik, and one of the saleperson went to get Jay for us. As we met Jay, he made us comfortable in his office in the second floor, and ask what he can do for us. We told him we had a trade in vehicle and wanted to buy the Audi Q5 2.0T if the price is right. Jay took us to the lot to see the Q5 we wanted. Showed us the car and all the usage of the controls prior test driving it. I test drove the car and my wife and I really like it. Dealing paperworks and the value of our trade in vehicle for what we want was the most easy part of the negotiating factor with Jay. I did not feel any pressure from Jay in buying the car and so as with Jose Padilla, the company's financing person. Every Audi Q5 details and options were all discussed to us if wanted to get it.

Because of her suggestion and service care and quality, my first choice for shopping for our new Q7  was at Walter's Audi (even though we didn't have the best sales experience when we shopped for our A6 at Walter's a few years back; the sales rep wasn't too educated on the A6 features back then).

I actually made an offer on a 535 BMW but the experience with the dealer convinced me to test drive the Audi A6 and that test drive, along with the great experience, converted me from BMW to Audi.  We ordered the A6 because we wanted a specific color and many options, ordered in January and it arrived May 2nd. Our delivery experience with Jay Baik was very professional and so comfortable I almost, not quite, but almost forgot I was spending a small fortune but you get what you pay for and I'm so please with every aspect of Walters and the A6.

However, David Ranciglio, Service Manager,  and Stacy Samuel,  went above and beyond the call of duty to make sure we would have a loaner car, and to make our life as easy as possible.  We were told that what happened was a catastrophic problem after the gas pump emploded.  Any other dealer would have taken an easier route by letting the insurance company lead the program.  However, These wonderful people knew that the insurance company's way of wanting to fix our car, would first, take over a month to get the car fixed, and secondly, was definitely not the way they felt that the Audi manufacturer would want the car to be serviced. David and Stacy were not willing to cut corners or compromise!  And so they ent directly through the Audi Company, and got our car fixed perfectly.

She was on the phone with me frequently to give me updates on the progress of thw work being done on my Q5.  Then I get another phone call when my vehicle is ready to be pick up.  Another phone call two days after to follow up if the vehicle is performing to my expectatons.  I feel pampered on how much attention I received from Stacy when I have my Audi's service at Walter's.  I am aware that the service staff at Wlater's Audi possesses good personal quality traits for them to deliver excellent customer service.  For now, I am well please with the service I received from Stacy.  If you have not have the opportunity to meet her, it only takes once and you will be very satisfied.",5.0

1729,"April 25, 2014","I recently needed to have my 2012 Audi A3 serviced; and I choose to drive greater than 70miles -from the Coachella Valley to Walter's Audi - expecting nothing less than expedient, consistent, and welcoming customer service. This was my experience: 
I had no trouble scheduling an early friday morning appointment two days before the date online. I received email confirmations. When I arrived early morning just before seven-thirty, I was greeted by an attentive, professional Ms. Linda Dobyns who shared a warm smile and quickly took inventory of my Audi.
Ms. Dobyns paid special attentions to my concerns of possible water-pump leakage, and full mechanical inspection. She quickly reassured me that any service repair would be covered by my certified pre-owned warranty. After calculating possible time-repairs, she was apt to offer my a loaner vehicle to go about my way: I got to drive a 2014 Audi A4 as my loaner vehicle; and went about my business. Now, at this time, for reasons other than misfortune, I did not have a cellphone with me. However, Ms. Dobyns quickly resolved an idea to send me emails - as she was keen to notice that I had a laptop with me. Throughout the service time, (which was less 5-hours) Ms. Dobyns sent me emails keeping me informed of my Audi's service repairs and any other concerns I had. 
Upon return, my 2012 Audi A3 was washed, repairs done and ready to go. At this time, Ms. Dobyns really impressed. She was quite knowledgeable about the inner workings of my Audi, she went over a detailed history of my Audi's services and provided insight as to when to return next for maintenance. I really appreciate it when people take the time to pay attention to the details that matter to me. Concerns, worries, fears of cost and warranty are all relevant to me. With this kind of customer-care, driving more than 70miles to Walter's Audi makes it all worth it when you know the job will be done right the first time, and most importantly when the people like Ms. Linda Dobyns demonstrate to take pride in their work. Thank you Linda for making my day & my drive worth while. ",4.8

Once Jesus knew when my vehicle would be ready for pick up he contacted me giving me notice, which was perfect timing as I would be passing the dealership around the time the vehicle was ready for pickup. When I finally arrived Jesus was assisting another customer and Stacy quickly helped me get situated and once Jesus was free to help me, he got me out of the door.

1770,"December 23, 2013","I would like to express my sheer appreciation for not only Audi backing their product but also for the quality of professionalism displayed by your staff and in particular one Jesus Moya.

My 2009 Audi A4 started giving me trouble on Thanksgiving day and after having my mechanic diagnose the situation I decided to locate parts to get the car fixed I called Walters parts department. I spoke with a gentlemen there (I apologize for not remembering his name) who gave me a quote on the part and then began to ask me questions regarding my vehicle, he suggested I bring the car in because it possibly could still be under warranty. He told me it would be best that I speak with Jesus in order to get a better perspective. After trying to transferring me he came back on the phone and said  Jesus was unavailable and asked that I leave a message which I did.

Jesus called me and told me it would be best to bring the automobile in and it would be a cost of around $140.00 to start but if it was still under warranty it would only be a $85.00 deductible, we agreed I would bring the car in Monday afternoon.

I met Jesus that Monday he asked me questions regarding the challenges I was having with car while taking his notes, Jesus said he would call me either later today or tomorrow morning. Later that day I did received a call from Jesus telling me it was the injector and that it was covered and that it would be repaired by the next day. I asked Jesus if that would be the reasoning for the noise I was hearing while driving the car Jesus said it was possible that it could have been backfires.

That next morning Jesus called me and explained that they changed the injector and the noise was still there, he said they dropped the oil pan and noticed metal shavings. At this point my worst fear had just been realized, Jesus then said that the engine would need to be changed and that he had contacted Audi and it was going to be covered. Much to my disbelief, I asked Jesus if he was serious and he reassured me I didn't misunderstand him and asked that I remain patient that it would probably take about ten days.

Jesus called me a few days later letting me know that they had not received the new engine yet but was hoping it would come within a day or two. I received a call Monday letting me know that the engine had arrived and that his tech was working on it and was hoping I would get the car back by weeks end. 

During the time Walter's was working on the engine I received two additional calls from Jesus with updates just to keep me in the loop. On Thursday I received a call from Jesus saying that the car has been completed and test drove with no leaks however they did noticed that the third brake light was out and that his tech will be repairing it and the car will be ready for pickup by 5pm. Jesus let me know he probably wouldn't be there as his day would be complete by then.

My son dropped me off at Walter's and one of the ladies greeted me and asked if I was here to pickup my car, then walked me to the cashier and asked if I wanted a water. I must admit I was fully expecting to have some additional hidden cost to pay, shame on me the cashier said $85.00 just as Jesus had told me on our very first phone conversation. As I waited for the car another woman went over my paperwork and explained all the work Walter's did to my car and explained some of the things she has seen here over her long tenure and that Audi backs there product 100%.

I bought the A4 from Walter's as a pre-owned automobile in 2011, I feel very fortunate that I did, not only did Audi back there warranty but the class and efficiency of Walter's Audi has made me a 100% satisfied customer.

I made my appointment and when I arrived I didn't have to wait for anything.

The waiting area was clean and up to date with all the amenities needed to either wait or do some lite business. I was offered a beverage twice, just in case I changed my mind the first time. When my repairs were completed the car was washed and vacuumed. I had some old mail on the floorboard I neglected to collect when I gave them the car, and it was neatly place in a plastic bag on the passenger seat when I received the car back.

1801,"April 17, 2013","The service department was outstanding! I have been in the customer service business for 27 years as a Director of National accounts, so I understand what good service is. 

First of all they were easily accessible and immediately took my call and e-mail for service issues.  The contacts for the service department were prominently displayed on their website so I didn’t have to waste time trying to find a contact. Once contacted, they informed their service reps and head mechanic ahead of time of what my issues were. Brian even researched for potential similar issues before I ever showed up the following day. This saved me time and the frustration of potentially having to explain the situation upon arrival. When I did arrive; Jesus and Brian were immediately available to talk to me, and I was quickly on my way. Brian took a test drive with me and listened intently. I feel confident that if Brian says there isn’t an issue, then there isn’t an issue! 

To contrast with Commonwealth Audi: Your met at the door by some kid who doesn’t even know what to do. This greeter then takes your concerns on a pad of paper, then you walk 10 feet and explain the same exact issues to the service rep who has to ask the same questions and prepare a invoice. This is very frustrating as you have to explain things twice within 5 minutes! When your car has warranty issues its bad enough, but explaining it twice within 5 minutes even makes it worse! When that is finally accomplished, you then have to see the car loaner specialist and work with this person separately just to get a loaner car. That takes an additional explanation on how long you need the car, same contact info, etc! You have cut out all of this extra work by allowing the customer one stop service by dealing directly with your service rep who handles everything! Thank you! 

Brian and his crew checked for the latest updates, TSB’s, fixed the rattle and weather stripping in the drivers door (unlike Commonwealth Audi who didn’t notice the loose rubber weather stripping and just sprayed silicone all over the rubber and sent me on my way!) and did my 25k service all in one day. My car was clean and available right on time as promised!  Outstanding, and well worth the 23 mile drive to your facility. Your service department, under your leadership, restored my faith in Audi and how a dealership should operate. 

So in closing, please keep up the good work and you will have my business for life.  I will pass the word on to my friends in Orange County and I’m sure they will have the same experience that I enjoyed. 

P.s. You were the final straw on this car and if I had received the same treatment from your facility like I did from Commonwealth, I would have driven next door to the Honda dealer and traded it in on the spot and ended the frustration. Thank you.

I highly recommend both the Dealership and Jose as the place to buy an Audi of any other car they sell. It also happened to be the cleanest dealership I have ever been in.

1831,"May 28, 2012","My car purchase experience with Walter's Audi was exceptional!   All the staff that assisted me in my purchase provided excellent customer service.   I used dread the thought of purchasing a new vehicle because I did not want to deal with the Sales representatives at the Dealership. Most of are rude and not very honest.   However, Minh Nguyen changed my view of customer service at a Dealership.  He was very nice, respectful and so helpful.  He explained everything to me in detail and was able to answer all of my many questions.  If I had to purchase another vehicle, I would purchase it from Walter's Audi only if Ming would be my Sales representative.   Walter's Audi's is very fortunate to have Minh Nguyen as an employee. Thank you Minh!",5.0

1834,"May 13, 2012","Minh Nguyen worked with me so that I could get the best available features with my purchase at an affordable price for my budget.  He didn't try to sell me to the most expensive car on the lot.  The atmosphere was relaxed with no ""hard sell"" tactics. I am happy with my purchase and highly recommend this company to anyone.",5.0
1835,"April 14, 2012","Even I did not purchase a vehicle from Walters, I would highly recommend them for their customer service and overall friendliness.  My wife and I were looking at different SUV's and they drove one forty miles to our house and offered to leave it overnight.  At no time were we pressured and it was great checking out the vehicle in a non-dealer setting.  Unfortunately we decided that we buy a different SUV, otherwise we would be doing business with Walter's.  Special thanks to Brett and Becky.",5.0
1836,"April 08, 2012","What a great experience, this is my first time buying and Audi and if all the dealers are like Walter's Audi I'll be back.  Tony was very plesant to work with, very knowledgable about the vehicle.  He didn't try to sell the car he just showed us why we should buy it.  The person who processed the loan was also great!  No pressure just the facts.  I truly look forward to bringing my car in for maintenance here.  I highly recommend Walter's Audi if your in the market for one.",5.0

1840,"January 31, 2012","Extremely professional and courteous.  No pressure or arm twisting, just intelligent answers to logical questions, presented with obviously sincere enthusiasm for and respect for the quality of the product being sold.  I bought one of the least expensive Audis made, yet was treated as though I was buying one of the most expensive automobiles ever sold!  I enjoyed the experience enough I'm sorry I can't buy another one every month or two, just for the fun of it!",5.0
1841,"December 16, 2011","I had a great experience purchasing my certified pre-owned A4 from Walter's Audi. I was helped at every stage by Dana Clayton. Previously, I've bought my cars at CarMax due to the common perceived hassle of haggling over everything with car salesmen. That was not my experience at Walter's. Dana had a very laid back approach and he didn't try to pressure me into anything. I love my new (to me anyway) car and would recommend Walter's Audi and Dana Clayton to anyone looking to get a car you can, without question, have an awesome time driving without any of the hassle of shady sales people just looking to make a sale.",4.8
1842,"July 11, 2011","Very convenient &amp; hassle-free experience! I live in OC so I had contacted the dealership about a price on a new Audi A4 and was able to confirm the price and all details before making the drive out to Riverside. Once I arrived, everything was ready and waiting for me as promised. No pushy sales pitches and no hassles.",5.0
1843,"July 08, 2011","I have little experience with purchasing cars, new or used.  This was my first major car purchase and I started the process from Okinawa, Japan with the online sales manager, Dana Clayton.  From the beginning, he was professional, polite, and very attentive in tailoring to my needs.  This sales manager went out of his way to help me register my car in CA for me while I was still abroad.  He offered to cover the costs of shipping the contract back to the dealership while completing the process and followed up on all of my questions with more than I expected.  I would say that Walter's Audi of Riverside has in it some of the most qualified salespersons and Dana Clayton is among those of the highest caliber.  If I were given the opportunity to recommend this dealership to another person, I think its safe to say that I would STRONGLY urge another person to visit Walter's",5.0
1844,"July 08, 2011",Walter's Audi already had great reviews so my husband I went there for our new purchase. We where not disappointed with the service we received from the Sales and financing. We are already planning on going back for my next car! ,4.8
