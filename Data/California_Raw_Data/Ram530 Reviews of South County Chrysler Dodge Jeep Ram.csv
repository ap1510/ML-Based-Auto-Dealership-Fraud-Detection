0,"March 30, 2020",I went in for a recall on my scat pack challenger and ended up walking out with a 2019 Hellcat charger. Everything seemed ok like a normal trade in transaction and I was happy with the purchase. Up until recently that I discovered that the financing dept never paid off my trade in and now I’m getting phone calls from my previous lienholder demanding I pay my now late car loan. Threatening me with damage to my credit score. I’ve never experienced anything like this before and with the “shelter in place” I’m caught between a rock and hard place not able to contact the dealer because they are closed. I’ve had to contact Dodge directly for help with this matter. ,1.0
1,"February 25, 2020","My husband and I just purchased a Durango SRT and Desan was with us every step of the way. From the moment we test drove it, to the day we decided to purchase, Desan answered every question we had. Desan made sure we understood the type of car, knew what it was equipped with, and how to navigate the car.  Desan was quick to respond to any questions we had and made the process much easier. He was very professional and passionate about his job. We enjoyed having him as our salesman and would definitely recommend him to others. ",5.0
2,"January 27, 2020","I was in the market for a commuter vehicle and came across South County Dodge. I put in a request for a quote on a specific vehicle and ADAM WARDAK contacted me. I reiterated that I was interested in the red vehicle specified in my online inquiry and asked Adam to send me the exact out the door price, as I intended to purchase the vehicle using cash. Adam texted me the cost breakdown and I called him to confirm, as I would need to drive approximately three hours to get to Gilroy, CA.

When I arrived, Adam did not make any attempt to come out and introduce himself. Shortly after driving the vehicle, I was told that my vehicle is more expensive than what I’d been quoted, and that the quote I was given was for a grey vehicle. I had fallen victim to a bait-and-switch and ended up driving over three hours for no reason.

I would also like to add that I have never purchased a vehicle at this low of a price point. I’ve negotiated deals with BMW, Porsche, Lamborghini, Rolls Royce and have never been treated this way. I don’t have much experience working with the lower end dealers and find it disgusting that they treat their customers the way I have been treated. I feel that a good business should treat all customers who are willing to give them their hard-earned money in a consistent and respectful way, regardless of the customer’s financial means.",1.0

12,"November 20, 2019","When coming to a deal on the price for a vehicle I was going to lease from this dealership, one of the things that was instrumental in my agreeing to the price they quoted me, was that i was told the vehicle and the lease terms would qualify me to be able to claim the CA Clean Vehicle Rebate (CVRP).

However after they had told me multiple times during the negotiations, including answering affirmatively when i directly asked them before signing, I found out later that in fact the lease did not qualify. 

Attempting to contact the dealership about this resulted in long strings of being ignored, given a run around, and  being told they would get back to us soon then they never did, over and over. 

At this point they have not in any way attempted to reconcile after their sales team lied to us. If they would at least work with us to reconcile the situation I would assume it was a misunderstanding and be glad to work with them. However, as of now i can only assume they knowing lied to me in order to get me to sign the lease.

My advice, stay away from this dealership. ",1.6
13,"November 19, 2019","Overall my wife and I had a great experience, 
Abdul was very helpful in creating a stress free purchase from start to finish.

19,"November 08, 2019","I recently purchased a 2019 Dodge Challenger SXT from SouthCountyDodge and am quite happy with the deal I received and impressed with the sales experience.
Adan Wardak  and John Samra were great to work with.  They are both friendly, honest, and responsive. Never were they pushy, upselling, or playing dealer tricks.
Compared to the other dealers I approached hear in the SF bay area, these guys at SouthCountyDodge  significantly beat price and were easy to deal with which made it worth the drive to Gilroy.
I would highly recommend visiting these guys if you are looking for Dodge or Jeep.

We were especially happy that salesman, Jim Campbell, could give us the price and not call in another person to negotiate and play games!

28,"July 06, 2019","James is a gentleman, knows his cars and trucks.  He gets a 5 star.

The dealership has great inventory and great prices.

But I have to ding the dealer for the time it took to get in and out - 3 and 1/2 hours.  And the decisions were made well before we drove in, already did a credit app, no test drives needed, easy as cake, right?  No - it still took 3 and 1/2 hours.

None of this was James's responsibility.  It's the overall dealer management that controls the time, and they were in no hurry to get it done.  Disappointing to say the least.  No respect for my time and distance travelled..

Also the women at the reception desk could not take herself away from her video game.  Really disappointed in lack of care.  Bad impression.  Don't know her name, it was 4pm on July 4.  If it wasn't for James and the fine price I would have walked out.

You asked, so there are the facts.

5 for James, 3 for the dealer.

Thank you.

29,"July 05, 2019","There were no Pacifica hybrids with the colors/ features I wanted in los angeles I went to 3 different dealers in LA and also tried the Truecar/consumer reports purchasing program.  ALL of the Dealers in LA told me that I would have to special order the car.  I found the new car I wanted on Autotrader at South county.  I called and made arrangements to pick the car up I flew in in the morning and drove home in the afternoon.  I did have to wait about an hour for the Abdul, the sales guy to get in even though I had scheduled my pickup for first thing in the morning.  Other than that the experience was positive.  Abdul was very helpful with the features on the car and helped me configure everything. The price they had was better than anyone else (and better than the consumer reports or truecar price)  even when you include the cost of the flight to SJC and the uber to the dealer.  I have not had the car serviced yet so I cannot comment on the service department. ",4.2

31,"June 16, 2019","Absolutely ridiculous

These people are trying to pull my credit on a cash deal and have the biggest attitude including the GM that calls me back and says they don’t want my business

This is the attitude before they sell a car so I wonder how it gets after you spend money

Update!!!!! Now the “GM” calls me and threatens me that “he will find me” if I leave them this review

Amazing business i have to say

So now next week I will send a bunch of official complaints to various agencies and Jeep as well

 Second update !!!

He called me again and threatened me again to find me !!!!  WOW I’m so impressed about the people there and how they pick general managers. Scary!!!!!!",1.0
32,"March 03, 2019","Bought a new ram 2500 diesel last week. Salesman Richard Taves was very slow, promised full tank of diesel and a detailed truck. As soon as the papers were signed, Richard went behind closed doors and was never seen again. Repediatly asked for him with no response. After 2 hours of waiting, he finally drove up with my truck, empty on fuel and very dirty. Cab a mess, sticker residue on windows and grill. Was almost 5 and we couldn’t stay and argue, but tried to contact Richard 5 times with no response. Called sales manager with no response, finally emailed sales manager and cfo. 3 days later the sales manager finally wrote back saying “I’m sorry we saved you thousands of dollars. For that reason we did not fill your truck up”

Run from this place, or if you buy expect no service.",1.2

35,"January 29, 2019","What an awful experience.  Would never buy from them.  They have great deals on their website, that really beat other dealers discounts.  They dont respond to any emails asking if the Jeeps that they advertised were available this is both to management and sales people, so dont waste your time sending.  I ended up calling the dealer, got a sales person, and specifically asked if a Jeep with specific stock number that they advertised was available. The person said it was. I scheduled an appointment the next morning (30 mins from my home) to BUY the car.  That was communicated in no uncertain terms.  I had my own financing and didnt want their 6-8% deals where they make $$, so when I got there in the morning they ""couldnt find the keys"" to the car, tried to upsell me on a model, and then ""searched inventory"" somehow while standing around to let me know none of the Jeeps that were at the sales prices were available, they were all sold.  The Jeep I had asked about  was mysteriously sent to another dealer with no info.  I wasted 3 hours, $40 on a lyft ride home.  What a disgrace.  ",2.0
36,"January 28, 2019","Giving one star because the price was good but that's it. Here are all the reasons why I would not recommend this dealership:

- brand new Jeep Compass was not ready when we had agreed I would be there, despite me sending all of my insurance, driver's license info, credit card number, and copy of a $13,909 cashier's check two days ahead of time
- when I arrived I was told I had the wrong day, despite showing emails and text message correspondence that had confirmed December 26 at 10 am
- when my father inquired about the delay (because I needed a ride there), he was told, ""if she doesn't like waiting, she can just leave""
- when I was signing paperwork, the DMV document noted a ""lienholder"" as Chrysler Financing, when I was paying cash for the vehicle. When I pointed this out to Willie Pettaway, he said it was okay to sign it. I crossed it out and initialed the lienholder and he said he needed to redo the entire form because it was a legally binding document."" So it was okay for me to sign an inaccurate legally binding document that claimed Chrysler Financing was the lienholder but not okay for me to cross that out (because it was wrong) and initial it...??????
- purchased a brand new vehicle and it was not clean, and they only gave me a half tank of gasoline (see photos of 63 miles on a new car and only 1/8 of a tank left on Yelp site)
- sent me a text message with a link to the video to explain my new purchase - the link didn't work; emailed three more times and got no response - it finally took another general manager to intervene (see pictures added on Yelp site)
- one of the ""general managers,"" Bob Mann, called me personally and said that, based on what I reported to him, he was going to fire his finance guy for incompetence, then called back to tell me I'd be getting an email apology (that never happened)
- I emailed Scott DePeralta three times to ask for the regional manager and his/her contact info - he never responded
- at one point, Scott emailed me and said I could just bring the car back, but the sad thing was that I couldn't because I had already used a $500 rebate that could not be transferred to another dealership
- I finally found a regional manager named Piyom Ghavimi who said he would assist - forwarded all emails to him and never heard back

From beginning to end, they treated me as if they were doing me a favor and could care less about customer service. There is nothing good about this dealership - go elsewhere. #worstexperienceever #dishonest #unethical #unprofessional #gameplayers",1.8

39,"January 02, 2019","I was looking for a Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid, with very specific options and colors, so I searched all over central California, and I found a perfect version at South County Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram Fiat.  To my surprise it was listed online at a price that was lower than I had expected I would have to haggle them down to (it was a 2018 after the 2019 have been on the lot for a few months, but still).  I contacted closer dealers that had identical vehicles, but all of them refused to match that advertised price, most all claiming that there must be some trick.  We don't live in Gilroy, so we called ahead, agreed on the price, and got everything rolling, to where this was in the end one of the simplest car buying events I have ever been a part of.  Once the car was on the lot, we were called, and the next day we drove over, drove the car around the block, and signed all the papers.  All told it took just 1 to 2 hours.  The one hiccup was that I ended up having to wait a few weeks from when I called to buy the car, and when the car actually got there.  It was listed on the website as in-transit, so I am not sure that much of it is the dealer's fault, but it was still frustrating that it took longer than I had expected, with few status updates.  Of course in the end, because I got the car for a very fair price, and didn't have to deal with any tricks, I was very happy with the entire experience.",5.0

44,"December 02, 2018","I had an absolutely terrible experience with this dealership. I called Browning Grimmett the day before I planned to come in to see a used Hyundai Accent and we agreed upon a 1pm appointment. He asked me to call him again once I was on my way, which I did. Only then did he mention that the dealership would be closing early that day. He told me it was closing at 3pm, when I arrived I discovered it was actually closing at 2pm. After an hour drive, he was completely unprepared to show the vehicle I indicated. In fact I had to remind him which car it was. It was in their sister dealership in Morgan Hill. After wasting 45 minutes to go retrieve the vehicle, we got through paperwork only to be told that we would need to come back the following day to finish financing. Though upset that at this, we agreed, and he said he would meet with us at 11:30am the next day. When we arrived at the agreed upon time, Browning was nowhere to be found. Only after waiting for 15 minutes did we discover he had not come in at all. Tony Truong abruptly came up to me, asking for my insurance documents without any greeting, and did not introduce himself to me until prompted by the fact I was clearly confused. I was then called ""distraught"" when I expressed my uneasiness at not being informed of what was happening. At this point a gentleman who did not give me his name began to intervene. He told me he didn't know what I wanted him to do. I asked if there was any price negotiation that could happen because of how much we had been inconvenienced and said that it does not instill a lot of confidence in me to make such a big purchase when I am being told so many different things. I was responded to in a very defensive, blame shifting manner, trying to make it seem as if it was my fault communication had not been clear. I was told if I did not have confidence in their dealership I shouldn't buy the car. And I didn't. I found the entire experience slimy and disrespectful. I was fully prepared to give this dealership my money, but was literally talked out of buying from them, by their own team. It was clear that because I was trying to buy an economy car that they wouldn't turn a profit on I was not a valuable person in their eyes. ",1.0

Beyond the sales experience it was one dropped ball after another after another getting the repairs done to the truck I just spent $64k on. Browning many times expressed his disappointment in the manner this was handled. This entire experience was ruined by poor communication post sale and service (repairs). I was quite disappointed in the way this whole thing was handled to say the least. Would I return to dealership, yes I would, but it would only be to deal with Browning.

These people had no problem taking our money when we leased a Jeep from them three years ago, but when it came time to turn in our Jeep when the lease was up they wouldn’t help us. We left messages for three weeks and they would not return our calls. When we decided to wait on hold instead, we were left on hold for over an hour. We went down in person and they were very rude and said they would help us if we were going to buy out the lease or buy or lease another vehicle, but if not we needed to go to another dealership to turn it in. Finally talked to the general manager and made an appointment to drop it off, but when we came in we waited over an hour for them to tell us that they couldn’t do it today and that we would have to come back tomorrow. We finally got frustrated and took it to another dealership to turn in. We are never going to buy another FCA product due to our experience with this dealership.

I emailed them with questions and asked them to respond using specific criteria I provided. I was immediately impressed when I received a response from Adam at South County CDJR within 15 minuets. Doing my due diligence I waited for responses to my other emails. This was my experience.
I received a few response within 24 hours. Only one of those bothered to answer all the questions I asked. Over the course of a week I was able to gather only partial information from the remaining 
dealers. Prices for the same vehicle varied by as much as $8,000.00. A few of the dealers never responded to my follow up questions. At that point I contacted Adam again and was able to speak with Abdul. In a few minutes we were able to reach an agreement. No hassle, straight forward answers, it was refreshing to be treated with such courtesy and professionalism.

I went on their site and found Ram deals so good, but was skeptical they might not be real. 

I went the internet sales route, and Jon Valiquette replied the exact truck I inquired about was sold, but he would find me one exactly as I wanted for the price I wanted, then he texted back saying he would give me the same 2017 clearance deal on a better equipt 2018 Bighorn, along with photos of it, a full price breakdown with MSRP, Discounts, Taxes, and Registration so I would know exactly the whole offer up front.

Jon was so relaxed and mellow throughout to whole process, his team put together the deal without any pressure, and for the first time in my life, I purchased exactly what I wanted, for the exact price I wanted,  with no grief turning down all the upsell offers, and saving over $15K off MSRP. 

I got a smoking hot deal, Jon was so cool, he even gave me a test ride in a Hellcat 707hp while we were waiting for the finance guy, and it was the most enjoyable vehicle purchase I have ever made.",5.0

Ben listened to my current situation and was able to understand my needs based on my financial standpoint and vehicle purpose. Ben did not try to push me into buying anything I did not want—even better, he educated me on all my options to allow me to make the the decision that was best for myself allowing me to feel in control of my purchase.
.
I walked in with an ideal price range and spent 2k more than I thought I would—and im completely okay with it because I was fully grounded and aware of what I was doing thanks to Ben’s assistance.

85,"December 19, 2017","I hate purchasing cars and most of all I hate the process. Its long, grueling, and in most cases you end up getting nothing done or ripped off. My experience with Ben here at South County Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram Fiat was without a doubt the best purchasing experience I've ever had. I inquired into this dealership from Orange County California for their incredibly low prices. I had gone to 2 other dealerships in my area and they all gave me the run around. I spoke to Ben over the phone and within a couple of hours the deal was made. I didn't even think twice. This dealership is about selling cars to the customer not ripping people off for their last penny in the bank. I was skeptical at first because everything had to be done online or over the phone but Ben was very professional throughout the entire process and answered all of my questions in a very timely manner. There was no pressure whatsoever and I felt very comfortable with the end result. I am very happy with my purchase and I hope Ben is still there in about 4/5 years because I am going back to Gilroy for my next one! ",5.0

Really Adam... is this your normal or were you just having a bad day?

He helped us fight the pit boss for the deal we had initially planned out (price and finance). We did get the deal we wanted thanks to Derek and the GM. When it came time to deal with finance he hooked us up with Tony Troung who found us a killer finance rate! These two gentlemen are the dynamic duo you need to contact if visiting this dealer. I don't know about the rest of the team but these two know how to treat their customers! The GM is an upstanding honorable business man. They have so much inventory and their prices are competitive if not cheaper than other dealers in the 50 mile radius. Give them a try, and be sure to ask for Derek for sales and when it's time to finance ask for Tony Troung! ",4.6

162,"September 11, 2017","I initially didn't qualify because of challenged credit,  but I really appreciated  the salesperson customer service (Joshua Castillo - go to him), the patience demonstrated, in addition to the Jeep product, so I returned the following day with a cosigner and bought the car I came for. 
I went through the motion of buying the car and was told i was approved, literally the car was being detailed/gassed up, then later was told that I was not approved so that was disappointing. 

I'd had hoped that the finance manager would have been honest up front and not have us go through the idea that we were buying a car or having Josh go through the trouble of working hard with us, telling us we were approved.  The process from finance was very shady.  

I would be careful at this dealership because of that.

We were looking for them to honor a advertised deal and Francisco says ""your dad is over there crying over $1500"".  ------EXCUSE ME??????------ Right then and there I lost respect for this person and his manager (Daniel Gutierrez), who was there and did nothing to STOP him.  He then picked a fight saying my sister had an attitude because she answered his question about where she went to school!  Needless to say we did not do business with these people.  

THE MOST BIZARRE, UNPROFESSIONAL, and HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE I'VE HAD AT A DEALERSHIP EVER. 
Would give native stars if I could.  ",1.0

Fraud. Only helpful ones are Stephen Fields and Bobby Martin..Zach refuses to return my dozen calls..Stephen and Bobby can only do so much..Zach and his sales manager took advantage of a senior citizen and a disabled person trying to rebuild life after a major injury. Very discouraging..Go somewhere else to purchase a vehicle. ",1.0
242,"March 07, 2017","My wife and purchased a Jeep Wrangler Unlimited from South County Chrysler Dodge Jeep RAM in March 2017.  Without a doubt, it was the best car-buying experience we've ever had.  We contacted the dealership about a Wrangler advertised on the South County's web site.  It was the BEST PRICE we've ever seen, and we phoned Zach Galindo (the dealer representative).  The price was so good we drive 300 miles to purchase the Jeep.  Everything was perfect (the car, the support, the pricing, etc.).  Everything was just as Zach told us it would be when we interacted with him on the phone and via e-mail.  South County has the best Jeep pricing, and they are an honest dealership with an emphasis on service.  I recommend them VERY highly.",5.0
243,"March 01, 2017","Stranded at dealership with my sick daughter. They can't drive me home but can drop me off in Morgan Hill. I live in San Jose. Wait tumes for oul changes have been ridiculous but had been patient until today. Have no loaner cars and unless I pay for my own ride home, I have to stay here. Very disappointed. Bought two Jeeps at the same time in late 2015 from Adam Wardak and valued Jeep until today. I think the only reliable car I have ever owned was a Toyota.l that we trades in for one of the two Jeeps we bought.  Once this car is deemed drivable, I am trading it in for something else. There is no reason for a 1 year old car to have engine issues. And no excuse for not having a ride home via a loaner or a shuttle.

253,"November 23, 2016","BUYING A CAR?!?  Where do I begin?  I'm sooooo EXCITED!!!!  Noooo wait....what am I thinking....payments....reliability....resale value?????  UGH HELP!!!!  Those were all the things that were running through my head.  I decided to just look online because to go to the dealership.....means salesmen will be on me like white on rice!!!!  I made some choices on True Car and debated pushing the button to send my request out to dealers so they can contact me and let me know they have the car for me.  CLICK!!!!  I did it, I sat back and instantly I received my first email from Isaac Mosqueda.  He introduced himself and let me know the Jeep Grand Cherokees they had on hand with my likes in mind.  I wrote back and said ""I'm excited and scared at the same time and I'm not sure where to start.""  He quickly replied ""It is an exciting experience.  Being a little scared is normal......I'm here to help.""  Whoaaaa, he's actually human!!!  My opinion of car salesmen has completely changed forever.....NOT ONLY was Isaac nice at the beginning but he never once made us feel pressured, pushed or wasting his time.  Isaac was so knowledgeable about every spec, size, model, color, options there was to offer.  Even when it came time for the financing part (the scariest part of all), he sat with us the whole time and ran different options and helped us come up with a game plan to work with our budget.  FINALLY when it was time to drive away with our dream vehicle, he helped sync my phone and put my home address in the navigation.  Isaac then went over every single button's function with ease and didn't even mind repeating himself when I got a little distracted with day dreaming on my new JEEP!  Thanks Isaac for teaching me Easy Buying 101!

267,"August 31, 2016","Getting your vehicles oil changed is never an exciting responsibility to fulfill especially when you have to wait around for several hours or TWO WEEKS. My husband brought in his Dodge Ram to the Gilroy service department for a routine oil change. Turned out he also needed to have a recall part replaced so they told us they needed to keep the truck over the weekend to wait for the part. The day we were told it would be ready WE had to call to find out when we could pick it up and they told us the part was on back order and it would be a few more days. Once again, after a few more days WE called to check the status and were told it was going to be even longer. Finally after TWO weeks and little communication on their end we picked up the vehicle. My husbands truck is an essential part of his business so we had to spend money out of pocket to rent another vehicle while they held his hostage and he even had to postpone a very important business trip because of it. After being a really pissed off about the whole situation I thought to myself ""Well they will surely make up for this with at least a small gesture (like a complimentary oil change)"". Not the case what-so-ever. They even had my husband pre-pay for his next oil change. Might I add my husband is the easiest going guy around.

Overview:

Robert Heslop, Daniel EL RAY ""Deal Maker"", Greg ""Always keep Cool"" Uhley, and Diego Romero ARE 100% AWESOME!!


*
GREG UHLEY was patient with me and my friend. We asked a lot of questions. We CHANGED THE TERMS. We asked for favors and delaying this  or that payment.

YOU KNOW WHAT GREG DID?

That's right. Greg just nodded and said OK and did everything over again.

Even when he had to print a bunch of ppw over again, he did it patiently and willingly to help our situation.

He answered all our questions, didn't  rush us, didn't pressure us. Greg acted like a patient friend to help us with any questions  we had.

Since  when does anyone leave a dealership finance dept feeling OK, treated fair, understanding everything, feeling like every little question was answered?

OH YEAH! From Greg's office at SC Ram.

GREG IS AWESOME!!!

He even made sure I had AC experience on hot day, had cold water to drink. 

Greg both did his job professionally, with experience, and made us feel comfortable too on a hot day.

He's funny and cool.

THX GREG 4 HELPIN US!!

*

Why do people that know Daniel call him ""El Ray?"" 

(Sounds like an Avenger Character).

Because El Ray doesn't mind you asking any or many questions.

BECAUSE DANIEL IS ""EL RAY"" THE DEAL-MAKER!!

Daniel is kind and friendly and patient. He'll answer all your questions. He'll explain everything in terms a new truck buyer would understand.

He is honest and he'll find you the best deal.

He makes you feel comfortable to ask anything, and also ask for anything.

I hope me and my friend can take Daniel out to BREAKFAST LUNCH & DINNER.

OH YEAH! That's what I'm talkin' about!!!

*
I met Diego Romero and his wife. They are very friendly and kind.

Diego answered all my questions and helped me find Robert after hours.

If you go to SC Ram and see Diego, say ""Hi Diego!""

Because he is awesome and he'll do anything he can to help you, and find people to answer your questions (if you ask a million like me).

*

I have been trying to get a truck for about 2 years.

About 1 year ago, I got preapproval for a Ram truck around $80,000.00.

I went to a local Ram place (not SC), and even with the pre-approval printed and in hand - the other place treated me terribly. They  treated me with contempt and passed me off to other employees and managers. They made me wait. 

Finally, I just browsed around, picked up some catalogues, and left. They didn't even say goodbye.

I think I was shocked because I expected with a printed pre-approval, they would be aggressive to help me.

*
Some months later, I tried again to get a RAM, and the person on the email (another local RAM,but not SC) - literally wrote, ""Time is money. Let's not waste yours or my time.""

Again, I was shocked. I only asked a couple basic questions.

*

Recently, I called SC RAM, and honestly, I was pretty rude over the  phone. I was  fed up with RAM and I expected SC to also  treat  me like crap.

I was really straightforward and asked the manager  to connect  me with the friendliest  dealer, also they would have to be amazing with email responses. I didn't trust RAM anymore verbally or to meet in person.

The manager said Robert would be the  best person.

The manager was correct.

Robert has just been amazing.

He answers all my questions so fast. He never rushed me. He never pressured me. He looked for a truck that would  fit me, and be what I wanted - not what would be better for his sales.

Here are a list of great things about Robert:

1) He responds to you so quickly
2) He's patient
3) Eager to let you try the truck he thinks you'll like
4) Good at reading into what kind of buyer you are, and what YOU need (not him or the dealership)
5) Willing to ask the management  any questions to help  customize the truck and / or the situation to help you
6) 100% honest and respects and cares about your concerns
7) Never, ever treats you like he doesn't have time to help you. I really, really badgered him with so many emails, questions, and nitpicked on stuff. He didn't mind at all.

I've been pre-approved again. I'm 90% sure I'm going to complete the purchase today.

Robert, you are an amazing Salesperson, Dealer, and individual. I truly believe a book should be written about your selling skills, customer service, and integrity. 

If SC Ram has dealers like Robert, I hope they expand and put the other local places out of business.

Read the yelp & google reviews and you'll see the differences in comments. SC Ram has the best feedback.

Thank you Robert and SC Ram!!!!

I am  a real person and anyone can text or email me to confirm this review is 100% true. I could not have had any truck without SC Ram and Robert.

I will leave my contact info with Robert in case anyone wants to verify this review.

Thank You 2500 times!!!",5.0

316,"April 15, 2016","I was working with dealers all over the Bay Area. Once contacting South County CDJR through the web I was contacted within minutes. Kyle Ifert got right on taking pictures of his inventory and texting me photos. Kyle worked hard to answer all my questions and get me the details I needed. I have never had a salesperson work so hard for a customer they had never met. They promised me to beat any other dealers price. They lived up to that promise by thousands. Patrick Bautista also helped me with the test drive and selecting a car. He introduced me to the GM and everyone was friendly and professional. The finance department Greg Uhley was the friendliest most professional finance person I have had the pleasure of working with. He showed me options, but didn't put pressure on me to take them. I usually want to slap most finance people that play games with trying to sell you on things you don't want. I have bought many cars and my experience with this dealership is by far the best I have had.",5.0
317,"April 04, 2016","First of all I would like anyone who reads this to know, I was not compensated for this review in any way, shape, or form. After going to our local Chrysler, Jeep, dodge, and Ram dealer about a mile away from my house on Capitol Expressway and getting the run around with the price they advertised and then it escalated up because I do not leased a car, I am not in the military, and so on.... I received a return phone call from a gentleman named Adam at South County wanting to answer some questions a Jeep. He quoted me a price for the Jeep Cherokee my son was interested in and said come on down when you have a chance. We left the dealership we were at and decided to drive down to Gilroy to check it out. Needless to say my son walked out with the car he wanted at a GREAT PRICE. No hassle, no fuss.

I needed a new work truck about a month later (Tow truck rear ended my employee, totaled the 2011 Ford F-150) Checked out the Ford, Chevy, GMC, and Toyota. I couldn't believe how much they wanted for a work truck. I called Adam again and told him I needed a new work truck. . Once, again the same great service and another great price! Bought a new 2016 Dodge 2500 and saved thousands. I am not exaggerating, THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. 

Last week I decided to purchase another work truck. For me, time is money and I wasted no time and called Adam at South County. He had a nice work truck at the dealership but I wanted something  a little nicer for myself, Adam said ""They had one coming in that would meet my needs, but it was in transit and should be at the dealership shortly"". Again it was a GREAT price and I saved a ton of money. OK, now I am exaggerating. But I did buy the vehicle site unseen. 

We are planning on expanding our company and when I need another vehicle there is no were else I will go. Save yourself a lot of time and more money. ",5.0

330,"February 07, 2016","This purchase began with an online search through TruCar and USAA car buying services. As compared to other dealerships, Adam was upfront with the sticker price as well as the drive out price. Other dealerships wanted me to ""come on down"" promising they would beat whatever price but never committing to anything concrete. 
Financing was arranged ahead of time so all I really needed to do was take delivery. Upon arrival another salesman handled most of everything. Lalo handled everything from the point we arrived, he showed us the vehicle, explained the features and a cliffnotes version of how everything worked, then went on a test drive with us. He was very helpful.
At the dealership he took our information for financing and various legal requirements and worked through my own mental lapse in forgetting various important documents. He took our trade and financing and came back with reasonable offers and seemed to be genuinely sincere in wanting to make sure we didn't get screwed over during the process.
When all was said and done the dealer financing gave us a better deal than our bank financing, and the finance office saved us a few hundred bucks from the state of California due to Military considerations.

378,"November 13, 2015","Let me begin by saying that South County Jeep was one of the most helpful and professional dealerships that I have ever visited.  I decided to do all of my correspondence via email prior to coming to the dealership.  I contacted eight Jeep dealerships in the Bay Area, and Adam Wardak was the first to respond back.  We went back and forth for about an hour, and he never took more than a few minutes to respond back to my inquiries.  The other dealers I was in communication with were taking an average of 30 minutes to respond back to my questions.  It was clear to me that Adam not only had respect for me as a potential buyer, but also respected my time.  Although they did not have exactly what I wanted in stock, Adam quickly offered to order it for me from the factory.  He quoted me at an unbelievably low price and ensured me that I would not find a lower price in Northern California.  Obviously skeptical, I shopped his price around the other seven dealerships that I was in communication with.  Sure enough, Adam's price could not be beat.  No other dealer in the Bay Area could even get within $2000 of his price, with the options that I wanted.  Furthermore, many of the other dealers were not even open to ordering me a new vehicle from the factory.  They were only interested in selling what they had on the lot.    

The next day, I went to the dealership to order to my new 2016 Wrangler Unlimited.  As I pulled in, I saw one that instantly caught my attention.  This one had about $3000 worth of options that the one I was going to order, didn't.  I thought for sure it would be much more than what we had previously agreed on.  Adam worked his magic, and somehow was able to offer me a price only $650 more.  I couldn't turn it down.  I decided to purchase that one, and now I couldn't be happier.

The overall experience working with Adam (sales), Dave and Greg (finance), Wayne and Jim (sales managers) was easy and enjoyable.  It is clear that South County Jeep is focused on customer service and your buying experience.  I am extremely satisfied and definitely recommend doing business with this dealership if you're in the market for a new vehicle.",5.0

That has nothing to do with Adam's service, personality and his overall performance. It was fantastic and should be commended.  Patience, professionalism and overall a pleasant experience. Adam worked hard for us and was so good about pointing out all the features of our new car, attention to detail and very approachable.

Thank you again, Adam. You made our car buying experience a pleasure and you deserve nothing but the best from SoCo CJDR

David also did a fantastic job with all of our documents. He was easy going and great to work with.

383,"November 08, 2015","Yes they found my car...I had stayed up the night before researching and found the car that I wanted... it had the winner package and it said there was only one. The next day... first they told me it was sold... then they told me they had one but during the test drive I noted it wasn't the one.... then they found it... the time it took to find it added to the excitement of buying my first brand new car with 5 miles on it...It had the heated mirrors, it had the heated seats and to my amazement it had a heated steering wheel .....but after I took it home the questions started; Oh My God those are ugly wheels... where do I get new ones... no one no not even the car guy Patrick could tell me... I asked if they could get me some there at the dealership, I wasn't given any information just a disparaging ""no""... I asked about other things; should I bring my car into the dealership shop to have a hitch put on it? Should I bring it into the shop to have the wheels that I finally found in San Diego at ""Anything Auto.com"" put on it? Still no information.... times and sometimes the voice on the phone just sounded like oh no it's her again..... sometimes I guess you just think a full service dealership means that ...someone to answer your questions ....somebody to point you in the right direction.... somebody to act like they care after you plop down $25,000 on the car and they get their 3% or whatever they get to for selling it to you....

I was already sold on what I wanted and because the location is no haggle sales I wanted S.C to add value by saving me time by pushing me through the purchase process as fast as possible. I reached out and Issaiac fielded my call. I was giving him VIN numbers that I found on the web to determine if the cars were still there and available. I was hoping that he would not say just come in without knowing if the model and price that I found on the was there because The price was low and I did not want a bait and switch. He was also helpfully giving me a heads up because I did not realize that the base model Of the jeep I was initially interested in did not come with AC.  I am from San Leandro so driving 60 miles each way is time consuming but in the end it was worth it. When I picked our new jeep up he did not rush us out either and was sure to help us understand how to use the features with our model.

I tried talking to 6 bay area (CA) dealers to order a truck and was given the run around including one dealer who said i could not even order a new (2016) truck yet.  Adam at South County was the most informed and responsive sales person I found.  He made sure that I got exactly what I wanted, even making sure i knew what each option offered and what I was purchasing.  There was no pressure at all, and he was very willing to work with me.  I was able to order my dream truck and I was originally told 8-10 weeks for delivery.  It arrived in 6 and 1/2 weeks to my surprise.  The finance manager David was able to beat the bank loan that i had been pre-approved for, and he made that process fun and again no pressure one way or the other.

418,"August 30, 2015","My experience with this dealership is that it is non-responsive and their rating is untrustworthy. After the purchase of Jeep Cherokee Limited last weekend I received the Thank You email from the GM of this dealership. The email states ""You may be receiving a questionnaire from Jeep soon. If you cannot give us a completely satisfied rating for any reason, please call me so we can better serve you as our valued customer"". I responded to the GM’s email and tried directly contacting him to discuss issues and to offer suggestions, instead he directed the sales person to contact me though I wanted to talk to the GM per his email. I find it absurd that despite the GM’s original email he was not accessible and he did not even respond to my several email requests which shows his lack of commitment. Apparently he might come up with the excuse that he had no time and was too busy.

Both the Sales person and Finance Manager were courteous. But I observed during the purchase that the sales person pleads to the customers to give the dealer 10 out of 10 rating when the survey is received so that the he and others can receive bonus. This practice appears to be unethical leading to misleading rating for this dealership. I believe the rating should be transparent without any influence. Apparently his focus was to get him bonus from my purchase that also seems evident from his text message.

I went to the dealer after the Sales person sent me an email with out-the-door price for the Cherokee Limited that I wanted, but during the paperwork in his office for the same SUV he said that I will have to pay $1000 more if I refinance with 0% which shocked me because he did not state so in his email and my preference was to get this refinance but I could not. Also, during the price agreement paperwork with the Sales person in his office he did not go over the option of the cooling-off period which I find misleading. Also he provided illusive response when I asked him why I can’t get the other vehicle from the front lot that was the same make/model with the same year, features and the sticker price.",2.0

505,"September 28, 2014","So, where do I start with the customer service and experience? I was a first time car buyer and being an engineer, I of course did my research on the type of vehicle I wanted to buy. After many weeks of test driving and haggling with local car dealerships, I found South County Dodge Chrysler Jeep Ram in Gilroy, CA. At first I was skeptical with how low the vehicle listed for with the huge dealer discount. I found a very, very similar vehicle in San Diego (one $400 option delta) and the local San Diego dealership said the deal was too good to be true, even went as far as saying it's a scam and that South County DCJR was crediting me with rebates that I don't qualify for. Well, guess what? Dealer discount means just that, dealer discount! 

I worked with Adam at the South County DCJR dealership and he above and beyond in making the vehicle experience as easy as possible. Not only did he repeatedly fulfill my requests for additional pictures and answering my questions in a timely manner, he was always courteous and professional.  My girlfriend and I flew up from San Diego to San Jose airport and Adam picked us up! On the way to the dealership he repeatedly asked if we needed anything (food, Starbucks, etc...) since we'd gotten up at 4:30a.m. for flight. Even at the dealership he gave us snacks, drinks, and even offered to take us out for lunch since we'd come so far to buy the vehicle. The paperwork process was smooth and stress free and we got on the road back to San Diego in no time. I can't emphasize enough how Adam went out of his way to help us and accommodate us with our unique situation. I emphatically recommend working with this dealership, and especially Adam, on finding/purchasing your next vehicle. If not, you're missing out on exceptional service and quality that South County DCJR has to offer! ",5.0

I would recommend Adam to anybody considering a new purchase - no matter how far you live from South County.

511,"August 29, 2014","We spent over 3 weeks shopping for a replacement vehicle for the family.  We considered used / new and were open to most brands. I have interacted with numerous sales professionals and managers.  All the staff we have interacted with at Gilroy South County Jeep Dodge were friendly, knowledgeable and courteous. 

Jim Fink - Very warm personable personality. I appreciated his candor and openness. 

Greg Uhley - He made the purchase so simple and quick.  He offered us many protection plans for our new car,  I enjoyed chatting with Greg very much. 

Scott DePeralta - I am not sure about Scott, because he did not give us much of a price break beyond what Adam could do,  That is why I rated the price as average.  He is doing his job and did it well. I initially walked away from this deal because of the ""take it or leave it"" approach.  I felt that it did not have to be Dodge and continued shopping.  He got lucky on this one, only because my wife felt like this vehicle fit our needs the best. 

Adam Wardak - This man is upfront and honest.  By far the most straightforward, respectful and attentive Sales Professional I have worked with on buying a vehicle.   All I had to do is tell him what I was looking for. It is amazing how quick he got back to me.  Since we did not have a car to fit the family in, Adam came to our house with vehicle twice.  He actually took the time to explain the different features the vehicle came with, Adam was so great with our kids and they liked him very much.  

In contrast with other salespersons I have worked with over the past few weeks - Some did not even talk to my wife, struggled to explain features and generally not motivated. 

Adam is definitely the person you want to work with if you are shopping for a vehicle.  I am sure, if it was not for his attitude and demeanor, I would have approached a different Dodge dealer for this purchase.

Final Note -
What is Adam to do if he cannot get a new vehicle prepped for his customers? You purchase the car at 8""PM, The employee tasked with detailing can only wash and dress the tires.  That is because there is other cars he has to do after. Thus our car new was not detailed.  Also the car was handed over to us with unequal tire pressures on all four tires,  There was not enough time to prep the vehicle for us and there was no arrangements made to make it right.  That is why Customer Service and Quality of work were rated as such.",3.8

Not only that, as a first time car buyer I needed help with every step of the process and Adam really came through. He also informed me of a large cash allowance which took even more off the price of the car. I got the same exact car I would have bought from normandin's for 24,000. After I picked it up he gave me suggestions as to where to go for the customizations I wanted, and called each place to ask for a discount for me. And I still shopped around.... but the places he put me in contact with were really giving me cheaper prices than all others I called. He even got me a better deal on my insurance rate by getting me in touch with the right agencies. He really helped with EVERY step of my car buying process.

522,"July 30, 2014","I walked in with financing already set-up.  I did my research, and knew I wanted a Dodge Challenger.  I used a car buying service through my bank (USAA), and South County CJDR had the perfect car for me.  Adam was VERY prompt in communicating with me, and his ""extra effort"" made me check out South County first.  Adam was not in whenever I pulled up, but Robert (I believe that was his name) took very good care of me.  After a very dramatic search, we found the car, and went straight into negotiations.  Jim Fink was very pleasant, and got me a good deal on my trade-in. This was a very pleasant experience for me, and I could not be happier with my 2014 Dodge Challenger SXT Plus.  ",5.0

525,"July 14, 2014","Overall great experience at the Chrysler/ Jeep/ Dodge dealership in Gilroy, CA. Very friendly and knowledgeable associates helped me find the car I always wanted. We originally went to buy a 2014 Cherokee but found a Cadillac someone traded in with more leg room. The car runs great and I believe I got a great deal and they even lowered my APR through shopping my credit around. I am happy that I made the trip! ",4.2

528,"June 11, 2014","The only negative I had on this purchase experience was that initial financing offers included, in the total price, GAP insurance and an extended warranty. These should have been presented as options at the outset along side the total price without these options. Other than that, the purchase experience was very smooth and the price was great. Overall, the drive from Hayward was worth it.

529,"May 21, 2012","We recently had service on our new car and during the service some body damage occurred.  We called Andrew the next day and he said to bring it in.  The next day Andrew sent the car to the body shop for repairs.  We were very pleased with the end result and would recommend South County Chrysler to all of our friends. ""Drive a little and save a lot"" means very little if the customer service is not there.  Thanks Andrew.",4.8
