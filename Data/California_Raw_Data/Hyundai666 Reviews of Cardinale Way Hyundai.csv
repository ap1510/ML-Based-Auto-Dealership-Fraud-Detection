0,"May 15, 2020","At first all seemed well. The buying process went quickly and they stayed late to close the deal as I drove in from two hours away. Within a few days after my purchase I noticed some imperfections  in the paint. I asked if the vehicle was in some sort of a major accident. They stated it was not because the car fax did not list detailed damage so it just had a minor accident. Fast forward a year later and the paint on my vehicle is falling apart. I am currently out of the country because of my occupation and they will not assist me. Lesson learned don‚Äôt close a deal at night when you might have missed something. Additionally, don‚Äôt shop at Cardinaleway Hyundai as not everyone wins like they would like you to believe.",1.0

4,"January 09, 2020","I hope it accepts ZERO STARS. I purchased a VW CC from Cardinale Way in Corona, that turned out to be a lemon. Dealing with the car issues from the time of purchase to the time we surrendered the car was an absolute nightmare. I could write a book on the insane stories and run around treatment we received from this location. I will share one story, which was the beginning of the end. The service was for tire sensor light that came on. We were advised the tire sensors were faulty and all 4 would need to be replaced, when the car was returned we were asked if there were a lot of potholes where we lived, because there were Bubble bulges on all 4 tires. We observed the tires and noticed the rims  all had pry mark scratches that aligned with the bubbles on the tires. We refused to take our car off the lot and demanded they fix our tires and rims. In the days that followed we were told they were fighting with continental tires for faulty tires... The tires weren‚Äôt faulty, the employee who worked on my car that day was. 6 weeks later, we got our car back with new tires and ‚Äúrepaired rims‚Äù the scratches were still visible, they refused to replace them. My car at the time was only 4 months old. We finally got a lemon law lawyer and turned the car in. I could go on with stories of 4 years of headaches... but if this review just saves one person a headache, it was worth the share. 

There are some good people who work there, but the sales manager and parts manager are truly rude and despicable.",1.0
5,"September 01, 2019","DECEPTIVE ADVERTISING. Expect to pay at least $1000 (pay attention to the $995 on the paperwork) or more than what is advertised on a used vehicle and who knows how much more on a new vehicle. Even the Sales Manager is in on the game. He comes out and says he didn't agree to what the salesperson says he could do and that the salesperson's language barrier may confuse some customers. The salesperson was standing right there when he made that derogatory comment.  I have no time for games and deceptive practices. Who puts a bunch of hidden dealer addons on to the top of the price of a USED vehicle? Paint protection on a car that already has scratches and swirls. Nitrogen in tires. The air is 78% nitrogen. I guess we all should be charged for that. VIN theft stickers in case someone steals and dismantles your car. These add ons they are charging for say a lot about the dealership. In addition, any addons should be negotiated with the original owner or better yet not charged extra at all because they are done for the purpose of collecting hidden fees from customers. On a used vehicle you are making 2nd and 3rd owners pay for these same addons an additional time. Quit making customers have to come into your dealership to have to deal with your FINE PRINT fees. Then you as a customer are spending all your time haggling over these Add On costs at the dealer's attempt to distract you from negotiating a lower price on the actual price of the car. We were ready to buy the car but were not paying for these deceptive add ons and the sales manager said if we didn't want to pay for them we don't have to buy a car from them so we didn't. Shameful practices and too much of a waste of time for the buyer.",1.2

8,"March 18, 2019","Officially hyundai had to buy back my vechicle because it was a lemon according to CA lemon law. Beware of horrible sales tactics like adding 1000 for extras they simply wont remove. Also adding 1000 for the security system which they also will not remove. Even after getting full quote online, it was 3000 over when they printed the contract. STAY FAR AWAY! Zero stars.",1.6

11,"December 13, 2018","BUYER BEWARE!!  This is one of the worst Hyundai/Genesis dealers in So. Cal. I purchased an almost new 2018 Genesis G80 a few months ago and took it to this dealer for service. Unfortunately, the service rep who took my call provided information that completely contradicted what second service rep said when we actually took the car in the next day - they essentially wanted me to pay more now that I was in front of them.  But it got even worse when the GM, Scott Jackson, jumped in to handle the situation. He essentially said there was nothing he could do, especially since I didn't buy the car from him. In other words, screw the brand, we only provide the best service to our own customers.  Scott was basically saying that CardinaleWay Hyundai Genesis does't really care about the brands it sells, or its customers. WOW!!  This came directly from the GM! I must say in all my years of owing used Lexus' and using their dealer network for service, I was never treated this. Any Lexus dealer I went to treated me as if I was their best customer. I must say, if this is how CardinaleWay Hyundai/Genesis  treats customers on the service side, I can only imagine how bad things are on the sales side. Based on my experience, I would ABSOLUTELY NOT RECOMMEND   CARDINALEWAY HYUNDAI GENESIS!!! THESE GUYS HAVE NO HONOR OR LOYALTY TO THE BRANDS THEY CLAIM TO REPRESENT",1.0
12,"September 09, 2018","I went to Cardinale Way to buy an advertised vehicle and turn in my lease. The dealership said they didn't have that one available but had another one in another color advertised for 1k less. I drove the car and was agreeable to the different vehicle. The advertised price was $14,677 online when the contract came out I was charged $15,300. I was also charged $2,000 plus for other non-advertised products called ""other aftermarkets"". I spent four hours there going back and forth with Michael, the ""Finance Manager"", haggling over the price. He finally dropped the $2000 to $995 like he was doing me a favor. I have an excellent credit score and they presented me with a 7% interest rate, like it was the greatest rate ever. After going back 3 more times they finally lowered it to 3.99%. By that time I was over it and left without buying the car. I have purchased 2 other cars at Cardinale Way in the past, and my fianc√© has purchased 3 of his vehicles there as well. I don't know if management changed, but they are horrible now. They've lost our business for good.",1.0

18,"May 23, 2018",I did all of my research online and when I found the car my wife wanted I emailed 5 different Hyundai dealerships and Joanne Haddad at Cardinale Way Hyundai was the only dealership who listened to my request and instructions.  What made this experience even better was the fact that she was in the office at 8:30am and was already working on my quote and keeping in contact via text and email.  The price she quoted for the Kona Ultimate trim was the same price that other dealerships offered for the Limited trim and she was able to get the monthly lease price under the amount I set.  I will definitely be coming back again.  ,5.0
19,"May 13, 2018","Basically this dealer likes to use bait and switch tactics in their listings. Their advertised price does not include a mark up they put on every single car of about 1000 dollars and they wont budge. We drove from far away only to be offered a car they listed at 18000 for 25,000. This is the reason they call dealerships, stealerships.",1.8
20,"May 08, 2018","Had an absolute horrible experience with Service department general manager Aran, who was rude, unhelpful, and dishonest. He lied in regards to conversations about the car recall issue I was having with Volkswagen, refused to issue a loaner vehicle, and had me waiting 4 hours. Doesn‚Äôt even have a business card to his name, I will never purchase another Volkswagen or deal with this dealership again. ",1.0
21,"May 01, 2018","I will never go back here.  Most of the service reps are good except Carlos and the service manager (rude and unhelpful). Every time I have had him there have been issues, primarily around letting you know when your car is done.  Recently I had my car in there and it started with me waiting almost an hour to be helped by Carlos. When he finally got around to me he said he was waiting for the two truck driver to drop my car. That was a lie because the tow truck driver finished 39 minutes earliwr, which I know because he called me.  Then  what was supposed to be a week. On the day my cars was to be done, I did not hear from anyone.  I tried calling twice with no one giving me an answer.  The next day I tried again and finally after 2 tries and several hours of waiting, plus the insurance adjuster trying to get an answer I waited on hold for 15 minutes for Carlos to finally come on the line and tell me my car was going to be another week.  
Yesterday when my car was to be done and I can get it back, nothing again. I called Carlos for him to tell me it was done the day before and he meant to call me.  Since I didn't find out until too far into the day I had to wait until today. When I got there Carlos had told my adjuster if he sent proof their check was on the way I could get my car, but Carlis didn't tell anyone and then said no.  Turns out some confusion on the check from the day before which Carlos failed to contact me or Insurance to get cleared up.  So once again lack of follow-up.  I ended up having to pay 7800 out of my pocket and have the insurance company reimburse me in order to get my car back.  When I tried to get the manager to help he was rude an unhelpful.  I told him I fly out tomorrow and will be gone for 5 days his response was well we need to figure something else out because you can't leave your car here.  Even the manager has poor customer service.
My advice, stay away. I was going to trade my Sonata in on a Hybrid next year it will not be happening at this dealership.",1.8
22,"April 21, 2018",Everyone there was so helpful and nice and did everything they could to get me in a car thank you LaVel and the beautiful young lady I did the paperwork with ,5.0
23,"April 20, 2018","My husband and I were ""just looking"" at another car option before making our final decision on a commuter car. LaVel welcomed us, asked us the ""need to know"" questions and showed us the cars that were best suited for our needs. After test driving  multiple cars, we looked at numbers to see what they could offer. LaVel showed us different options and answered all of our questions. In the end we choose the car we initially wanted and got the price we needed to fit our budget. In the entire process, LaVel treated us like friends and made us comfortable in our decision. So don't forget, ask for LaVel at Cardinale Way Hyundai!",5.0
24,"April 04, 2018","They lied to me about the car I purchased. They told me that it was certified pre-owned. I had another dealership inspect the car due to several issues involving rust, and it turns out the car was involved in a frontal collision. 

Dealer told me that the car was never involved in a car accident. Caught in the lie. Second lie was when they said the car was certified and it passed inspection. It didn't because the hood of the vehicle has been patched along with the front bumper. 

Fighting with GM over the lies I was told is another issue. He sounds like a crook and uses vocabulary accordingly. ",1.0

He answered every question without hesitation.  Lavel also shared with me about the history of Hyundai, which I thought very interesting.  Semere (sp) was very professional and courteous too.

28,"January 13, 2018","This dealership lied, misrepresented, and said whatever it took to get us in a used car which ended up spending a month in the shop. We were called at least once a month for the last year of our lease asking us to come in and look around. Our lease was up in December. In October we saw a used truck on their website. We came in and liked it, but expressed concern about ending our lease early. We were told all we would pay was October's payment, and a restock fee of $400 because we weren't purchasing the vehicle or getting in another lease. Several times I asked different individuals, so I don't pay a lease termination fee, and was told no. The truck was a lemon. The day after taking it home, the check engine light came on. It spent 4 weeks in the shop, was even sent back to the manufacturer. During that time, yes, I did have to make November's payment on the lease, because I was lied to, I also of course had to pay on the truck (which was in the shop). This totalled $800 on two vehicles I was not driving. The general manager apologized that I was misinformed, but said there was nothing he could do about it.
After finally getting my truck back, I received a notice from Hyundai finance. I would be paying the restock fee, which I anticipated, but also a $490 lease termination fee. I will also be charged for any damages of course, which there are none and we also were well under mileage.
Nobody can help me resolve this. Everyone passes the buck along. GM blames the salesperson, corporate blames the dealership, finance says the dealership should reimburse me but they can't waive it.
I will tell all my friends not to go here, not only because they lie but Hyundai doesn't have a good corporate structure. I'll stick with Honda, which has excellent customer service and Norm Reeves Cerritos is the best. I have purchased 2 cars from them and leased one. I was even over the miles on one and the finance company waived it since I was a repeat customer.",1.0

31,"December 24, 2017","This is a great dealership experience for me. I traded in my Nissan for a new Hyundai and was pleased with how easy the process was.

35,"December 18, 2017","Most horrible dealership and the worst experience of my life!! Talked to Roman (sales person) over the phone and he gave the pricing for the new car and confirmed with the senior manager about pricing before I drove 2 hours to get to this dealership! He called me 4 times and confirmed that there are no scams and price that we had finalized on includes all taxes,titles and fees. He said that he will have the paperwork with the same figures and the car ready for me when I get there. After test driving the vehicle and sitting down for paperwork, he ended up putting $4000 more than the price I was told just 2-3 hours ago. I was so shocked and asked him what just happened! He was hoping that I won't catch the difference of $4000?? Then, we checked with the Managers working there and all of them seemed like SCAM artists to me. Even after the sales person agreed in front of managers to telling the price to me over the phone, they said they will NOT honor the price. They said either take the price with $4000 more or just leave! They started using bad language and rudely asked me to leave! I've never had anyone treat me this way and I don't understand how a dealership would tolerate this kind of behavior. I wasted the whole day and time! PLEASE DON'T come to this dealership and waste your time and money!!!! This is my first time ever writing a review online because I genuinely don't want anyone else to go through the trouble like I did. Please stay far away from this dealership and these scam artists!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This time I was looking for a new car because my Accent was recently totaled in an accident.  I decided to go with Hyundai again because my Accent did not give me any major issues and I had a good experience at this dealership last time.  Once again, they were very helpful in finding the right car with the features I wanted that was within my budget.  I am very happy because they were able to get me started on the new car while insurance was still sorting things out with my wrecked one.  Both times I have bought a car here, I dealt with Lavel Darty.  He is very professional, I told him what I was looking for and he delivered.  Also, I felt that this was the only dealership that has actually taken me seriously.  The only thing I didn't like, was that there was about another $1000 worth of dealer installed accessories on every elantra I looked at.  It would've been nice if they were optional and not mandatory with every new vehicle.  I am okay with those accessories, but I probably would have passed if they were optional, because it was not added to the sticker price.",5.0

47,"November 24, 2017","Worst dealer ever!  We have never been treated so poorly in trying to buy a car. I always try to give companies the benefit of the doubt, but  wow.... You guys are TRULY a piece of work and DO NOT care about customer service. I cannot believe you find it acceptable to tell us the car is available and to pick up, then we drive to pick up (after taking time off work to do so) to only have the car NOT be there. Then, when we question the dealer as to why, we're told it's OUR fault. Ummm..... No, it's your fault, and don't you dare try to blame your customers.

At this point, we should have listened to our gut with the whole ""fool me once, shame on you"" ringing in our ears, but nope.... We fell for your scams telling us the car would arrive that day and if we're there first thing in the morning with an appointment, it's ours at the price we negotiated. Well, shame on us, because we arrive a 1/2 hour before our appointment, and these spineless slime xxxxx are giving the car away to someone else because they're willing to pay a little more for dealer adds on you haven't even put on the car yet. xxxx, I'm sure you're reading this and saying, oh, well obviously it's your fault because that's the mentality your salesman have. 

We will NEVER return to your store, and we will make sure not a single person we know EVER sets foot on your premises. The only thing making me OK with the way you guys treat your customers is knowing karma will come back and bite you guys in the xxx.",1.0

After everything was completed, my sister told me that she hadn't really looked into a Hyundai but that she would come back to buy a car just because of Freddy.

120,"July 26, 2017","I had a 10:00 AM appointment & waited for 3hrs to be able to speak with a finance manager even after having an appointment to come in and sign.  This was a lease deal, and the terms were already set and I had waited for the vehicle to come in for several weeks.  The leasing manager couldn't speak to the contract, and had to get advice and help from other parties while I waited.  The vehicle had scratches on the hood, and hadn't been detailed when I arrived.  I had to choose if I wanted to wait longer, or leave the scratches.  The vehicle also didn't have a full charge, and I was given the option to wait yet again for the charging to be done (which didn't get done prior to my appointment) or leave with it as-is.  I was forced to sign paperwork stating that the dealer would take no responsibility for this, even though it was completely their fault and mis-planning, in order to leave.  We had planned to go to LA that afternoon, but this through a barrier to that plan...  Then after about a week, I was contacted to come back and re-sign the contract because there was a mistake in the calculations.  A new contract was sent to me, as I refused to go back and wait, and when I received it I noticed a fee that was not disclosed to me on my initial visit.  I'm extremely dissatisfied.  I was told after the fact that the General Manager said that fee is fixed and if he doesn't agree to it he can just bring the car back.  What kind of customer-focused service is that?  He has never once had the courtesy to contact me in this experience.  The car has 2k miles on it by this point, can you imagine how much time taking the car back will take and what they'll come up with to charge me that that point?  I have agreed to sign yet another contract if sent or delivered to me since my time is so undervalued at Cardinale.

152,"May 27, 2017","We had a TRUECAR guaranteed price that Cardinale Way Hyundai  agreed on. They didn't have the color we wanted but they said they will get it.  The next day they called and asked us to come back to the dealership to sign a document showing our intent to buy the car.  They required us to place a down payment as earnest money and we obliged with a check.  

A couple of days later they called to inform us that the car was ready and we came that same day to purchase it.  As we were going through the price, we noticed some optional fees in the form of extended warranties, etc that we felt were unnecessary.  Right below the base price was an additional 'Installed Options' line in the amount of $995.  The sales person explained that it was for the nitrogen that they inflated the tires with and the 'edge guard strips' (plastic on edge of doors they put on all their cars) which was not yet, by the way, even on the car we were about to take home.  When we first looked at a car the other day, we were told that those features were already included in the price of the car.  So we were baffled why it was being added back on to the base price.  We asked to speak to the manager but we were told that he was already packing up.  We were very disappointed and decided to leave.  On our way out, we saw him, SCOTT JACKSON, general manager of this dealership and we were hoping he would make it right.  We asked why they are charging us those options that we do not want.  Answering from the door of his office, he flatly said the 'Installed Options' is not optional.  He got closer and with hands on his hips he said if we didn't agree with the price with the 'installed Options' price, we didn't have to buy the car and we can just go ahead and leave.  We told him that if he wasn't going to honor the guaranteed price that they agreed on then they just wasted our time having us going back and forth the dealership.  In an very aggressive tone, he had the audacity to say we wasted their time and yelled at us to leave the dealership.  They agreed on honoring the Truecar guaranteed price in the beginning but now they're trying to renege on it by adding extra charges in the guise of installed options.  But they're also saying the installed options is not an option?  That's deceitful practice.  

They're obviously trying to attract TRUECAR customers but as we learned, they had no  intentions of honoring it.  Therefore they shouldn't be in the TRUECAR business.  

This general manager SCOTT JACKSON just disregarded and disrespected us.  It will not be a surprise to see that lack of regard and respect for buyers trickle down, if it hasn't yet, to all who work under him.  He dismissed us and humiliated us and yelled at us to 'get out' or he will call the police.  

We are NEVER setting foot on this dealership again. There are other Hyundai dealerships out there who will treat their customers decently.  Just look at the yelp reviews for several years and you'll see a recurring theme of complaints about their deceptive practice and disrespectful treatment of customers from this CARDINAL WAY HYUNDAI dealership.  I don't know but it looks to me like they need a new General Manager. ",1.0

159,"May 18, 2017","Hello. My father bought my daughter a 2014 Nissan rogue for around $18000 cash on 4/1/2017. Exactly thirteen days later, my daughter was tboned and the car was flipped over and totaled. During the process of handling the aftermath of the accident, we found that the car was in another persons name still. Not a dealership, a person. So, we personally went to the dealership to get copies of the bill of sale and temporary registration  (all that was in the totaled car). Our insurance requires a pink dlil in the name of the current owner (my daughter) in order to process her claim. We are now more than half way through may and have repeatedly asked the dealership for the pink slip. At first my daughter was told that the car came from another dealership and they had to get the pink slip from them. Then she was told it came from auction and they had to get the slip from them. They are aware we need that for insurance purposes. We call daily and still have yet to get the pink slip. My daughter has been laughed at and basically treated like a child (she is 23). it is ridiculous that anyone should have to jump through such hoops just to get a title to a car that was paid for with cash!!

I asked them to at lease give me a discount to fix the but to no avail and went as far as refusing to give me back the damaged part so i could prove it was a long standing issue. What dealership does that - dishonest ones‚Ä¶ The mechanic where i take my car said they have a reputation for selling lemons.

200,"March 22, 2017","The sales person, Eric Dance, was excellent to work with.  I leased my first Genesis from him in 2012 and came back to now lease my new G90 from him.  He made the process very easy, relaxed and a pleasant experience.  However, when I got to finance, the person pressured me multiple times for add -on protection packages.  After telling her no thank you as politely as I could, she still insisted and even asked at one point ""why dont you want to protect your new car?""  She even explained that when it came time to trade my car in for a new vehicle, that I could be liable from Hyundai directly for wear and tear and damages to the car, separate from the trade in value.  This made me even question maybe I was making a bad decision leasing the new G90 in the first place.  I spent way too long in the finance process and this made it that much more unpleasant.  it was a real downer to what had been up to that point a very good experience.  I still left the dealership that day happy with my new G90, but it was a little less special because of that finance experience.  This should be a lessons learned opportunity for Cardinale Way; that if they hope to be one of the premiere Genesis retailers, they really need to work on the entire customer experience.  They do an excellent job on the sales part, with Eric and the sales manager, but they really need to work on finance and rounding out the whole customer experience.   I became a lifelong Genesis enthusiast and believer in the product because of Eric and the sales team.",4.6

She stayed in touch with us thru the years and was ready to help us as our lease was coming to an end.  She asked us what we were wanting and encouraged us to call her( she gave us her personal cell phone) when we were ready to move forward on a test drive.   We called and scheduled an appointment with her to test drive the new Tucson and was sold on how great it was.  We left a few hours later with our 3rd Hyundai and we know Joyce will stay in touch, she calls us her VIP clients.  She is an amazing human being and we tell anyone looking at Hyundai's to go and see Joyce!!!",5.0

Freddy showed me my options for what I could afford and not once showed me something that wasn't in my budget. I then started to ask about the bells and whistles and he was very professional about it all. 

Yes I wanted the sunroof, push button starter and the extra fun gadgets, but Freddy got me exactly what I needed at this time in my life. I can get all the gizmos and gadgets on my next purchase...lol!!! 

I can't thank Freddy and Joe enough for what they have done for me...Mahalo e Ke aloha nui loa!!! (Thank u from the bottom of my heart!!!)

264,"November 29, 2016","My experience with dealerships in the past were not enjoyable. Too much pressure and cockiness from the sales staff and financing, to the point where I would bring my boyfriend to do all of the talking, as I did not want to deal with them, or any of it for that matter. He came with me on the last two car shopping purchases. I hated having to go car shopping, as it just aggravated me.  Well, I brought him again, as I expected this time was going to go the same as all my past experiences. To my, pleasant, surprise my experience on this day was VERY different. I was able to speak with Robert Bauer and not have any hesitation in speaking about what I was looking for. He was very polite, informative, patient and he did not pressure me. My intent was just to test drive and then decide later. I ended up purchasing a vehicle that I did not expect on purchasing. I intended on purchasing an Elantra, then looked at the Sonata and ended up with the Tucson. I, absolutely, love it!!! Robert's patience helped me in looking further at the other vehicles on the lot, with no rush.  Sam, in finance, was very friendly and fun to talk with while signing all my papers. (This was when I used to put on that fake smile and just try to get through the signing...in a quick way.)  Thank you for making this experience what it should be...FUN and ENJOYABLE!!!  Thank you, Robert Bauer and Thank you, Sam in finance (sorry, unsure of his last name) and of course Cardinale Way Hyundai!!!   Happy Hyundai Owner!!!",4.8
265,"November 28, 2016","Buying cars from the past was such a hassle not getting what I needed or wanted. It used to take forever to receive the car after finance also. But with my salesman Freddy Haddad, the whole experience was painless, satisfying and most important I got what I needed and wanted. Also it was well within my budget. Freddy Haddad has a great sense of humor and went way over beyond our expectations. He is easy to talk to and is a very honest person. I'm so glad we had him as our salesman.

Which should have been a very happy day for me: in buying a brand new car, left me with the worst experience and feeling broken. 
I had already been to several other dealerships when a friend of mine recommended your salesman LaVelle Wilson and the Cardinale Way dealership. I was very clear with LaVelle from the beginning on what I wanted and I even went as far as telling him my quotes from the other dealerships. He insisted he could get me a better deal. I was very clear on what Elantra I wanted I had it narrowed down to two and wanted a price on them both. How I didn‚Äôt want to waste anyone‚Äôs time nor did I want my time wasted either. He text me saying he could get me a better deal. His manager even called to confirm my appointment and that they could get me a better deal. However, they would not tell me a price over the phone but kept saying how they could save me $4,000.00. Well I certainly did not save the money and this experience has not only been the worst but in the end I left with a brand new car which was switched at the very end telling me I had to sign paperwork because they grabbed a different car. I specifically said I wanted the bigger screen and this is a 4.3 inch. That is a huge difference to me. Why bother to show me and have me test drive a car and tell me yes you are getting this one just cloth seats and gray. Well I‚Äôm sad to say no I didn‚Äôt get gray I got a metallic gray and I certainly did not get the car I drove.
Not only that after we had decided on a price, this is at 11:30 am LaVelle said he was going to go over to the other dealership and get my vehicle. I asked him how long will this be or I can come back next week? LaVelle had me fill out his satisfaction sheet then. I wish I had not done now until after my experience because after 11:30 everything changed. He said this will not take long and everything should be done by 1:30 me out the door in my new car driving home. For me to driving in traffic I don‚Äôt like. I told him because if this is going to take longer I will come back next week; he promised and said no it won‚Äôt take long. That I needed to sign some finance papers and I said ok I‚Äôll walk across the street and grab lunch and then I should be back to get the car. He took me to finance and left to get my car. (he didn‚Äôt return until after 4pm)
Finance- Jeremy Hollingstead
If I had to base my whole experience off this experience I would tell everyone to never go there ever! To not give a dime nor their time. This person was not only rude but extremely unprofessional! I sat down to sign papers and he started to go over the extra warranties. I told him I am not interested. Unfortunately for me I had the worst experience! I certainly wish I had left the dealership and walked out. The finance person Jeremy Hollingstead  told me ""What's your problem! I don't understand I'm trying to sell you all the added warranties! I'm giving you a good deal. I have taken it down!"" I kept saying no. Then he said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll lower your interest rates, I have points to work with.‚Äù As soon as I heard that it clicked in my head and I became upset! I said no, I don‚Äôt want that and I knew it, I know that I have good credit and if you can lower it now then why the xxxx are you playing games with me. I don‚Äôt like playing games. I said I‚Äôm done I need to go cool off, he said where are you going I said I told you I need to cool off your pushy and rude. I don‚Äôt play games get my papers ready for me to sign. That I have been here since 9 something in the morning it is now late and I‚Äôm tired and need something to eat. I said I‚Äôm going to walk across the street to In-n-Out I‚Äôll be back. At this point is when I should of left the dealership. No manager was called no one offered to help and I felt like I was stuck. I went to go eat called my parents and then came back to finish signing the paperwork. Again I still got flustered because as he said sign here, here, here, and here. Just sign. I said I don‚Äôt know what this is for. He said sign; I said what this is for? He said LaVelle should have gone over all of this. I said stop, if we have a problem here get me someone else. I said I don‚Äôt care if LaVelle told me or not, I don‚Äôt remember and I‚Äôm asking now. He told me what it meant and said sign here, here, and here. I seriously wish I had just walked out. By now your salesman LaVelle is still not back and I am almost ready to be in tears. I paid cash for a car that I forgot I wanted to use my credit card since my interest rate is so low on that since your finance couldn‚Äôt give me a good deal. He said I need your check. I gave it and was flustered. He was so unkind and rude. Didn‚Äôt say a word like nice doing business nothing, just completely unprofessional. Certainly I will not recommend him. Really a person just paid cash for a car and you treat them like this? Here is another concern of mine. Would he ever talk to a man like that? Treat another man like that? I believe he treated me like that because I am a woman.
I went and sat in your lobby waiting for my car. I was getting upset because LaVelle text saying he is getting the car he will be back soon, and then they needed to switch the car a different car now. Now he needed to get it off the truck, it‚Äôs after 3:30 and how he needs to gas it up, detail it. I am completely stressing out because not only have I wasted my whole day I am realizing I am going to be in major traffic. He finally shows up and says we have to change all your paperwork because we got a different car and a different vin.
I am beyond tired now. Here is where I am so worn down I am making more mistakes. They changed the paperwork your jerk of a finance guy kept saying sign here here and here. Doesn‚Äôt go over anything now I am realizing he put the wrong address. I asked to have this changed. He put the wrong phone number and doesn‚Äôt change it. He scratches out and writes in pen on my dmv reg. sticker for the window which really come on be more professional print out a new one.
I finally walk out to see the car I am exhausted! Congratulations to your dealership on scoring a sale and getting my trade and having me leave with a less then vehicle then I agreed upon!!! Your detailer did a horrible job and this should be unacceptable. I had to ask to have him come back out and fix things and then I finally told LaVelle, I‚Äôm sorry I need to leave it is late and I told him I need to eat. My blood sugar levels are dropping and I know I have less than 10 minutes to put something in me or an ambulance will be called soon because I will pass out. He never said let‚Äôs take it for a test drive, and I don‚Äôt know if you have ever dealt with anyone in this state but they should not drive nor should they make a decision because really they are confused in this state. I left your dealership thinking I had the correct vehicle. As I was driving I realized the seats weren‚Äôt powered like I wanted, the vehicle didn‚Äôt have the sports button for the tighter driving  like I liked, it certainly didn‚Äôt have the bigger screen I wanted and most of all when I got home I realized it isn‚Äôt the correct color.
Then the next day when I went out and saw the vehicle and had to turn on the defroster I realized they didn‚Äôt clean the windows. This car was not detailed. This was a quick wipe down of the vehicle. 
This is a bad reflection on your dealership. In the end after all was said and done now I can look back and realize just how bad this was. Do I expect your dealership to make money yes I do. Do I expect for everyone to be treated with respect absolutely. Integrity and honor are big things not only in my professional life but in my personal life as well. I am sorry to say your dealership lacks both of those qualities.
Good luck to you and your dealership however; I hope you take the time to remind all of your staff about your company core values and your Company Name.
I have shared my experience with my friends and my co-workers. I have learned a valuable lesson and I can only say I am deeply saddened that this was not a more pleasurable experience for me.

465,"September 09, 2015","I had to take my daughter's Elantra in due to a battery issue yesterday and took it to Cardinale Way as this is where she purchased the car. We will not be coming back to this service department again. The staff were not friendly, not pleasant and not helpful. They were very hard nosed about the battery not being in warranty and were not willing to work it out. When I told them I would be taking the car to another dealership's service department they said ""that's okay."" I reminded them it shouldn't be okay with them as it should be all about customer service for which they did not give any. It was not only the service adviser but the service manager that had this attitude. At the other dealership I was given excellent service which was the opposite of what I received at Cardinale Way. (by the way the service department at the other dealership was busy which I am sure was in part due to the kind of service they give, whereas there had only been 2 customers at Cardinale Way for the 2 hours I was there...maybe due to the kind of service they give?) I come from the mindset that as a customer I should receive good customer service as this is how a company gets more business and stays in business.",1.0

Visiting the dealership was a very relaxed and pressure-free experience. Freddy and Lavelle treated us fairly and with respect. The car we bought (used 2012 Hyundai Accent) was very well equipped, in great condition, and at a great price. My wife and I spent countless hours searching for cars online and communicating (voice, text and email) with many dealerships. In the end, we made the right decision to go with Cardinale Way Hyundai!

481,"August 06, 2015","This was our second experience with the dealership and I must say that as for sales people there are significant differences in their approach. Yvonne was kind, easy to talk to, straight forward, and attentive. Sultan was nice, but started to fall into the stereotypic ""car sales man"". there was another salesman ( he drives a 350 Mercedes) involved but I can't even tell you his name. He disappeared as soon as the paperwork went to the finance guy.As the purchase process neared it's final stages Sultan became less and less involved. At one point we didn't even know where he was; turned out he was so busy with our trade-in that he lost focus on the new purchase. We got the feeling that the only thing he was interested in was our old car. We understand that since we were return customers to the brand and to the dealership that maybe we don't need a lot of explanation but we did just spend hard earned money that we would not have normally spent at this time. We do love the car and it is really nice; but people still need to feel important, whether they least the least expensive or the top of the line. For now the customer service is falling short. ",3.0

Freddy worked with his GM and they got me the next day in the car I wanted no lies or wasting my time.

523,"April 16, 2015","I will never purchase another car from Cardinaleway Hyundai because of the service i recieved today!!

Over the last 4 years i have purchaded 2 cars and 1 Platinum extended warranty.¬† I brought my car in to the dealership (riverside) 2 weeks ago (taking off work early unpaid) and they refused to service my car because i hadn't changed my name to my married name.  After speaking with Hyundai Advantage, they said it wasn't required to change my name because i had my old ID.  So i wasted a day!

Then today i brought my car to the Cardinaleway Hyundai because i wanted my car checked before the warranty was expired AND the check engine light was on.¬† I was met unprofessionalism at its finest!¬†¬† The man behind the counter (before he even looked in the system) said it would be $125 to look at my car.¬† I told him i had a zero deductible and with a smug look on his face, after looking in the system,¬† said ""it would appear so.""  I told him why i was here and he then said it will be an extra $125 for the certified technicians to go over my car.  I then asked to speak with the manager, Scott.  I told him my issue with paying any additional money and his response was, ""well we can get you in to a new car"".  To which i was utterly offended and disgusted.

I have spent over $30,000 on 2 cars from the Cardinaleway Hyundai and an additional  $1700 on an extended warranty that i NEVER USED and they want me to pay an additional $125 just to look at at my car?!  Because of this, on principle alone, i will never spend another cent with Hyundai....EVER!  You have lost a LOYAL customer over $125.",1.4

526,"April 06, 2015","Lavelle,

You are holding true to your Reputation. Good Man. ??

In the past your dealership has had Good and Not so good reviews, dealer ship reviews seem to be much better now, as was our Very Good experience at your Dealership.

You Mr. Lavelle Wilson were a Great Salesperson, and have always had Fantastic reviews.

 The internet can be good and bad. In our case I'm going to give you and your Dealership a Great review.
I will be posting only good things about you and your dealership.
Your Dealership stayed open after hours, so my sister and myself could drive up to look at a used Honda civic, which my sister bought.
There were a couple of small things we noticed you verbally said you would help us out with that. Also we noticed a couple of small things wrong the next day.

You have been true to your word, to do everything you could possibly do as a Sales person of a used car.
Your Dealership Backed you up completely and you took good care of us.
You are so very right, about me looking out for my sister.

Thank you very much Lavelle.

I really appreciate all your help.

She personally inspected the van the day before I was scheduled to visit, and called to let me know there were two minor scratches on the van (she even sent me additional photos from her cell phone so I could see the detail). When I arrived, Joyce was immediately ready to show me the van, and it was exactly as she had described it.

I started looking online and came across Cardinale Way Hyundai, I fell in love with a 2013 Chevy Spark and proceeded to contact the dealer and request more information. Within minutes I had received a phone call from Freddy and we made an appointment for the very next day. After a very anxious day at work, I drove over to the dealership at 5pm. Freddy was very helpful and full of information about the financing process, considering this was my first time taking out a loan for a car. I was out of the dealership quicker than I had expected and I drove my new car home that night! Months later, I am still as in love with my car as I was the day I drove it home.

I did most of the transactions over the phone with him, and I informed him I have a set amount I want to spend (on the lower end).  He took the time to listen & hear what my needs were & worked with me on my budget.  He answered every concern and returned all calls.  No pressure and straight to the point.  A very enjoyable experience.  He let me make my own choice, wasn't hassled to raise it, worked with me to get me into an amazing vehicle and a great deal. Freddy is a great guy to work with, and willing to help with exactly what you're looking for.  I am out the door with the vehicle I wanted with no problems.  

By the way, I live an hour away from the dealership. (Glendale to Corona).  I hope that tell you that he is the guy that you should ask if you want a great deal and someone that would bend over and backward to help you out.

600,"January 15, 2014",I originally had another sales associate tell me over the phone that they had a white veloster turbo in a stick shift at the dealership. Im a pretty busy guy so I made an appointment and swung by after work. When i arrived the sales associate who made the appointment with me was off for the day and the car that was promised was at the dealership was also not there. Thats when I met Yvonne. I explained to her that im busy with work day in and day out. I know what I want and if she can get it ill buy it asap. Keep in mind it was late on a Wednesday evening and the dealership was closing. Yvonne spent about two hours after the dealership was closed looking all over for a car for me with all the things I wanted it to come with. I sat at her desk and worked off my Ipad. She couldnt find exactly what I wanted and because of how late it was we decided to exchange numbers and talk the following day. Yvonne called and texted the entire next day all the different versions of the Veloster turbo she could get me. It was perfect. I could focus on my work and every 30 min or so I would get a text with a few cars and what I thought. To make a long story short in one long day of texting and calling we found what I wanted and I was driving it home that Friday. In my opinion she went above and beyond to find me a car and make sure I had exactly what I wanted. It was really nice since i have limited time to do anything let alone shop for a car to have Yvonne do all the work and get me exactly what I wanted. It was a real nice experience. My previous car was a Hyundia Tiberon and I'm a big fan of the warrenty. I had the Tiberon 10 years and having the kind of experience I had with Yvonne I will definitely buy another Hyundia after im done with my Veloster. Seriously she was the best. ,5.0

605,"January 11, 2014"," My family and I were very pleasantly surprised by the great experience we had buying a car at Cardinale Way Hyundai in Corona. We spoke with Lavel Darty over the phone and he gave us an overview of the types of cars available and the prices that we could expect. We were a little hesitant to come to a car dealership on Black Friday and did not really know what to expect. 
 When we arrived, Lavel ensured that the car we were thinking about was parked in front and ready to test drive. Lavel is knowledgeable and friendly, and at no time did he use any type of high-pressure sales tactics with us. Lavel‚Äôs professional candor and his personal care really made it a good experience.
 After deciding on a vehicle, Lavel continued to make the rest of the experience a pleasure. We have purchased vehicles in the past, and the experience we had with Cardinale Way Hyundai was one of the most painless car purchases ever. Our timing to start the process was late in the evening, but the staff at Cardinale Way Hyundai never made us feel like we were imposing. The finance department employee (I believe it was Regina Pham) was very thorough and extremely informative, and she was quite friendly as well. She stayed late to ensure that everything was in perfect order, as did Lavel and the general manager. Again, this made the whole experience even more enjoyable.
 When we were finished with the paperwork, the car was cleaned, prepared, and ready to go. The process was relatively quick and quite painless, and I would not hesitate to come back to Cardinale Way Hyundai in the future.

We where met by Sultan Haddad who was great at finding out what my daughter was interested in and showed her a few cars and was never pushy in the process, he took his time with her while my son was looking at the Genesis coupe.

After Sultan did his job in presenting the vehicles to us it was time to buy.

This is when Paul and Jeremy got involved.
these guys found a way for our deals to work so my kids could get what they not only wanted but what they could afford.

As soon as I walked through the door Freddie and Nirby treated me like family and weren't those annoying salesmen that are just after a sale. I had spoken to Freddie through email and phone before I came in. He quickly pulled up estimates for me through email and sent me lease quotes over email without even going in (no other dealer will do that!). Freddie made the process extremely easy with no pressure to buy. When I got there Freddie and Nirby worked together to give me an even better deal that was was originally negotiated over email. I ended up leasing a 2013 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid Limited (I love it!).

I shopped around other dealers and Freddie and Nirby gave me the best deal. I got an amazing deal that I could not have gotten anywhere else. I went to Tustin Hyundai and they were trying their best to rip me off (Tustin Hyundai has the worst customer service and does not care about their customers). DO NOT EVER GO TO TUSTIN HYUNDAI AND GO TO CARDINALE WAY HYUNDAI.

If you want a great car experience at the best price I highly recommend going through Freddie and Nirby. They treat you like family and make the process very easy.

(I was asked by the woman if I wanted to wait for the car and I figured it would take approximately 45 minutes,as I have always waited before at other dealerships and shops for past oil changes )  I said I would wait) MISTAKE!
Arriving at the dealership at 7:55 and waiting in line (3 cars ahead of me) at 8am, we watched 2 service people walk back and forth and in circles for 15 minutes before helping even the 1st car in line. As I watched the one guy check everyone in (writing information on their piece of paper using peoples cars as his ""desk"" (A clipboard would be much better) I was finally tended to at 8:25am. I explained I had an appointment at 8am, he then proceeded to tell me it would be about 1 1/2 - 2 hours) I was very shocked at this time frame, and  asked if this was typical, he told me yes,  I decided to leave.
I called 1 hour later and was able to make an appointment for 10:00. that same day.
I came back, did not have to wait in line, the service man started to put his paper on my car to write information down- I asked him to please not write on my car, as I saw the other guy do this morning; He gave me the rudest look shook his head and said I was only going to use your window (AGAIN! USE A CLIPBOARD) he then wrote information using his hand under the paper.  I did not wait for my car- As I was waiting to be picked up, my car sat there for 20 minutes before they took it back, I did receive a call 1 hour later that my car was done.  
I came back to pick up my car and It took over 20 minutes to get anyone to help me and give me my keys.There was no one at the cashier, The service guy was on the phone with someone, and when I walked near him he completely ignored me. 20 minutes later the cashier finally showed up.

I was so impressed with these 2 gentlemen that without them promoting their dealership, I was moved with how genuine and sincere they were in the real world. They both were likeable and professional gentlemen. I decided I would go down to take a closer look at the all new fully redesigned Hyundai's. The economy had been slow for the last several years and my wife and I decided we had wanted a fuel efficient vehicle to run around town in to transport our six children to and fro. When I arrived at the dealership, Adam and Joe remembered me by name. WOW! I felt these guys cared. They asked me specific questions, as to assist me in discovering which vehicle was right for me. My wife and I were looking for a nice looking car, that offered hands free mobile ability, along with 30-40 miles per gallon. They pulled my credit and within 2 hours, I was driving off with a new Hyundai Elantra. We decided to lease since they had a special for $199 a month. We had actually been in the market for several months. I wasn't sure what car we wanted, let alone which dealership to patronize. Boy, I am glad that the good Lord lead us to these fine folks. They filled our tank and offered us our first oil change complimentary. Everyone likes a deal. Several months later when I brought the Elantra in for an oil change, I noticed a sparkly new Hyundai Sonata Hybrid that offered close to 40 miles a gallon. Well, with all the fuss over Hybrid's, I decided to purchase. I gave the Elantra to my daughter and the Sonata to my wife. The Sonata was fully loaded, double sun roof, Navigation, Bluetooth, Blue Link, Leather Seats, ect..... and the best part was a lifetime warranty on the battery. Wow, what a deal. Well the economy is still sluggish and I am sure glad to own 2 stylish, fuel efficient Hyundai's form Cardinale Way.

628,"August 27, 2013","I am a fan of your Hyudai.  I own one and was looking to buy another.  

I wanted to bring to your attention fraudulent bait and switch practices at Cardinal Way Hyundai in Corona.

They advertise Certified pre-owned cars ‚Äì and describe the inspections etc ‚Äì at a price ‚Äì I called to confirm availability ‚Äì and then drove out to buy the car.

Eric Dance ‚Äì the salesman was not familiar with the inventory and we had to go online to see what they had and if it was available ‚Äì we did find the car and test drive.

We started the paperwork at the advertised price,  he started discussing lemon laws ‚Äì and I asked if they sold lemons, he said that a Certified car would have any issues resolved ‚Äì but that they would disclose if it was a lemon. 

Then he said the certification was additional to the advertised price.  I requested that they honor the advertised price and he said the finance guy would not.  I am sure this is illegal and I am filing a complaint not only with you but with the various regulatory agencies. 

The following is from their website ‚Äì the day after they refused to sell it to me at the listed price ‚Äì but instead said I would have to pay more for the certification ‚Äì this is after 8 pm ‚Äì when they also said I could drive the car home that night.   How could they do the inspection and reconditioning that night ‚Äì clearly they had either already done it or not.

629,"August 05, 2013","I went into the Corona location on 062213, after viewing an advertisement on a Prius that I had been interested in on http://cars.com. I went in just to take a look at the car, not really sure if I was going to purchase it because of my up-side down trade that I had. 
The finance manager named Regina Pham told me that my loan was approved. When I sat at Regina's desk, she congratulated me on my loan approval and informed me that I had some options. I then asked her at that time if my loan was approved and she said ""yes"". I asked her what bank had approved it and she said LBS Credit Union. I then asked her if she had spoken to the bank and she said, ""yes I just spoke with them."" Then she told me that the bank was giving me two options. The first option was to get my rate at 5.99%  for 75 months, I would have to accept a package, which included gap insurance, warranty package and an option of a new alarm system ..or two other features.

She told me that If I didn't get the package then my rate would increase to 8.99% because the bank was using money from the ""reserve fund"" to get me the lower interest rate. She also told me that some of her fellow co-works had  told her to just give me the 8.99%, but she told me that she wanted to ""help me out."" I agreed with her on the first option, which was the 5.99% interest because my payments were going to be lower and my interest rate as well. Prior to signing the documents I had asked her, ""so the bank has approved my loan?"" and she said ""yes"" and pointed at her screen. So I trusted her and signed the documents and left with my new vehicle. 

A week later I got a call from a Finance manager Scott, in which he informed me that I had to go back into the office to re-sign the docs because my loan didn't get approved and that they had to go with another finance company to approve my loan at a much higher interest rate. I called Regina and asked her why she had lied to me and she said that there was something wrong with the system and that it happens to one out of every 10 customers. I told her that I did not want to leave with a vehicle that was not mine unless I knew for certain that the loan was approved and I could afford my payments. She then tried to school me by telling me that I didn't know how the process worked and that there were three parties involved, the bank, the dealer and the purchaser and that we are not always all on the same page. 

I had to drive back to the dealer, which took me an hour in traffic to get there. Fortunately Scott was able to help me with the situation and get me a loan approval at 6.99%. I am just really upset with the way that this business operates and how finance manager Regina handled the entire situation, she was dishonest, rude and dressed very unprofessional. 

DO NO GO HERE, UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE RIPPED OFF.

I rate this Dealer unprofessional. I like Dealers to be up front and straight forward but this Dealer was by the far the opposite. ,2.0

650,"November 16, 2012","The customer service was good, I was met shortly after walking onto the lot. Allen was friendly and we talked about looking at various models. I test drove the car I eventually purchased. I felt as though I was at the dealership all afternoon causing the overall experience to bring the rating down to just ok.  After seeing the prices on tv I felt as though more discounts could have been offered but otherwise the price was good. If I would have received a year of free XM Radio and oil changes I might have been happy with that instead of the additional discounts. ",3.8

The whole experience was quick and professional from the time of internet negotiations,financing and driving away in my new vehicle. Nirby is a top notch guy, not the slimely car salesman type I encountered at other dealers. If you are looking for a new vehicle with low pressure, this is the guy to see!",5.0

663,"April 01, 2012","I was looking for a very rare car, I drove 250 miles and called several lots and ""Singh"" instantly found it for me!! As soon as I drove in and laid eyes on it I knew that was it, and Singh came out immediately to greet myself, my dad and my son. There was nothing this man did not explain to me or show me about this car he knew it all!!! He made it a very pleasant sales experience, since it was a rather hard one for me since it was a purchase with some money my husband had left me after his sudden unexpected death. I am 60 years young and loved the time I shared there at  CardinaleWay. The only disappointment I experienced was not getting the auto I purchased at the priced I was promised by the Hyundai company itself, this had nothing to do with my sales man. His boss explained to me that they do not honor the Hyundai Circle Certificates, which at this point is being investigated by Hyundai. LOVED THAT TIME THERE THO, TOTALLY!!!!!!",4.8

665,"February 22, 2011","Yvonne Scholl was our salesperson we bought our Used Hyundai Genesis from - she was extremely warm, friendly and well informed.  Her follow up was excellent and probably one of the reasons we bought a vehicle from her.  She is a ""breath of fresh air"" in the car industry.  She makes a very professional first impression and has a friendly smile always.   Her associates - Paul in Sales and Ejesz in Finance were equally professional and refreshingly enjoyable to work with every step of the way.  We are very pleased with our purchase.  Especially going from a Mercedes to a Hyundai - Genesis which we think is every bit as excellent a vehicle.  Much to our great and pleasant surprise!",4.8
