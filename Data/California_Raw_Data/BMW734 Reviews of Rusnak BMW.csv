29,"March 31, 2020","I purchased my BMW X1 a couple years ago from this dealership and have been going to all my regular service appts here as well.  I was so blessed to have one of my first service appts end up with Renee Norris, one of the service advisors.  Renee has been my service advisor ever since.    Renee truly cares about your vehicle and what's best for it.  She explains everything that needs to be done and makes realistic recommendations, not ones just so the dealership makes money.  I was in an accident recently with my vehicle and from the first moment I spoke to Renee on the phone about it, I knew everything was going to be taken care of.  Renee explained the steps that I needed to take to deal with my insurance company so my vehicle would be covered.   She went above and beyond to help me out in this stressful situation, and she made my awful experience turn into something that wouldn't be as bad as I thought.  Thank you very much Renee for all that you do!  I wish there were more people like you in the world.",5.0

36,"December 20, 2019","This is a much delayed review: 

In spring of 2019 I ordered a customized BMW M4-fully loaded. It was a horrible experience. 

Even so, I maintained my composure despite: 

• Being out $110,000+ with nothing to show for it (more below). 

•Amir Khansari screaming at me at the top of his lungs over the phone in March 2019  over asking him about the vessel that the car was going to be put on from Germany. That incident went unreported until I took possession of the vehicle (out of fear he’d yank it out from under me). Moreover, Amir couldn’t even be man enough to shake my hand, introduce himself, or otherwise acknowledge my presence (let alone thank me for my purchase) when I was right in front of him to take possession of the vehicle, and he knew who I was. Amir’s name is on the sale itself and Patrick pointed to me and said: “that’s [me] ” to him when I came to pick up the vehicle. Amir’s response? A scoff followed by a stare down in the parking lot later that day. For point of reference, Amir is the same age as my father, so his aggression was both humorous and sad.

•L. (“Patrick”) Rodriguez could neither keep a single promise nor deadline, yet I never threw him under the bus, including when I made a formal complaint. I will have no problem doing so in the future, however. 

•My J.D. candidacy was mocked by Belnadin (“Belle”) Hormozi; evidently selling cars at a two-bit dealership is more prestigious than pursuing law. 

•My elderly mother was not even offered water nor given directions to the bathroom as she sat in the waiting room for 3+ hours after we had been on the road to grab the car for 7+ hours (14+ for me). “People” who can’t even be nice to the elderly or children, have no soul.

•Jeff Kaltman called me 3 times in a row on a Saturday night to ask about an internal review I left and subsequently made a bunch of promises to “make this [the above] right”, that he never kept. Moreover, he was nowhere to be found and did not return our subsequent calls regarding the recent news. Just like everyone else at Rusnak, his word means nothing and the only schedule that matters is his own. 

•Despite all of that garbage and with my car finally in my possession, the car is now being recalled. But, just like having to hold Rusnak’s hand to put together the vehicle, I had to do so to get the refund (lemon law). Countless calls were made to Shawn Jordan to facilitate the refund and he was standoffish and aloof, at best. 

•Lastly, Al Lemoine was about as helpful as a snow parka in the Sahara Desert and showed no contrition nor empathy sans some canned, managerial slogans. 

•I haven’t gotten a SINGLE apology for all of the inconvenience I’ve undergone. Rusnak cannot control recalls, but they can control how they act, their business practices, and can exhibit basic human decency. If my father hadn’t recently become involved (or if he weren’t an attorney), I’m 100% certain that no action(s) would’ve been taken whatsoever. 

So, yeah, given the above (which is far from an exhaustive list), I’m pretty sure that the Dalai Lama himself would concur that RUSNAK is infested with insufferable, inconsiderate, unappreciative, and unreasonable cretins.",1.0
37,"December 19, 2019","have been a customer with them for over 2 years, when came in to speak with Robert, he had me wait over 30 minutes, and when he showed up (even though I was looking for a new lease) never even asked me to sit down (if you even go to new dealership they ask you to sit down or have some water)  let alone this was where I have been a customer for 2 years. and simply says we have no good deals, only a loaner (demo car). later I find out that was not even true. I didn't like how he treated me was very unprofessional. ",1.0

55,"November 05, 2019","Well let me start by saying one word, CLAUDE! Enough said! This was my very first time purchasing from any RUSNAK dealership. I was in the market to upgrade my wife's 2017 3 Series. Our lease was coming up and I was interested in the 2020 530e, plug in hybrid. I began looking into different dealerships, comparing prices, inventory, availability and deal structure. I narrowed the search down to 3 dealerships, two closest to my home and one farther away. They all had different variations of the exterior color and interior color I was looking for so I had to just choose the car based on deal structure and more importantly customer service, extremely important. I am willing to pay more for the right service! Once I narrowed the search down to three dealers, I looked YELP and other review sites to see what people were saying about certain sales people. I  had a deal in place in 2 hrs with the dealership that was farthest away and the sales guy was nice but didn't know too much about the car. Secondly, I read wonderful reviews about Claude Cantin here at Rusnak Westlake and decided to send him an email. It was late Friday night when I emailed him and he called me right away! At that moment, I knew this was going to be a good experience. He called me, asked me the right questions. Asked me which car I was interested in, I told him I had the stock number and he looked into it right away. Next day he called me back told me he had the car still available and when I wanted to come in? I asked him when he would be in, he told me this was his weekend off but he would be happy to call one of his co-workers and have them show me the car and work the deal with them. He said he wouldn't be in until Monday...I told him that it was ok and I would wait to have him show me the car on Monday, no biggie. RUSNAK is about 15 minutes from my house but Bob Smith in Calabasas is 5 minutes from my house, which is where I service my other BMW, I had my service manager @ Bob Smith give my information to a sales manager there so they could call me to see some cars, by the way this was 3 days before I spoke to Claude for the first time. That guy NEVER called me, I had to call him and I had to force an appointment on Saturday to look at a car and he couldn't even find it when we got there. He seemed like he wanted to go home and so did we, with the service he gave us. Anyways, we decided lets just wait until Monday and meet with Claude. Boy oh boy, are we ever glad! Monday morning came around, 10am sharp I get a message from Claude, ""Good morning Walter, will you be able to make it to see the car today? If so what time because I want to charge it and get it washed for you!"" I mean come on, we didn't even have a deal yet and he was already washing it, charging it...oh and he even gassed it up! That's service!!! We set a time and my wife and I showed up there like clockwork. Claude was exactly as he was over the phone, super chill not pushy, answered all questions and PATIENT! Get this, on top of this stellar service...the car that they had in inventory had EVERYTHING WE WANTED AND MORE! All the bells and whistles and then some. Claude patiently walked us around the car, then we went inside to try and make a deal. And again he did not disappoint, he is HONEST and did everything in his power to get me the terms I requested. In the end the deal was a tad bit more to no fault of Claude of the dealership. I was willing to pay a little more solely based on the customer service I received! I was happy with the deal, shook on it and boom! As we waited for the paperwork Claude had one of the front desk girls, I wish I remembered her name because she was AWESOME! She took us outside and sat with my wife and showed her how to use all the new features in this car, a lot...lol. Once we were done we went back inside and sat with Claude a little longer in the lounge area, just talking and hangin like old friends, it was great! Once the Finance Manager was ready, Mrs. Belle Hormozi off we were to sign paperwork. She was polite, fast, efficient and very knowledgeable and not pushy at all! And finally we were done! What a wonderful white glove experience from beginning to end! Claude Cantin you have a customer for life and RUSNAK your employees did one heck of a job! Thank you we will enjoy our new 2020 530e!",5.0

 I was assigned to Service Advisor Art Simcox who was efficient, professional and sympathetic to our situation, yet realistic .

83,"September 19, 2019","I want to share my experience in choosing a car in RUSNAK BMW. I leased my previous BMW x5 in Rusnak almost 3 years ago, and now it's time to return the car and choose a new one. Vitaliy who worked with me last time showed me all cars that interest me, talked about new options, answered all my 100,500 questions, and also arranged a test drive on cars I liked.

133,"March 16, 2019","I'm only dealing with this place when I need a car. 

Was looking for a X3 with specific options and found about 6 across LA & OC. I emailed all the dealerships and over the course of a day got dozens of calls, texts, emails from OTHER places wanting ""more info...need to get on the phone...can't give a quote unless I stop by...etc."" 

Then - a respectful and straight forward email from Roger Carroll immediately quoting the best deal he could offer, explaining his ethos ""never to annoy"" and making sure I had the best buying experience. This initial quote beat everyone in LA by over $1K during the course of the 36 month lease, so I called and told him i'd head up the next afternoon to look at the car.

Arrived the next day at 2:30pm to the car already prepped & detailed at the front doors to the dealership. Roger introduced himself and his assistant then took her time explaining the updated features & tech while Roger had my lease turn-in evaluated. Then to Roger's office where he discovered he could save me another $250 due to my insurance company, and then another $900 with multiple security deposits (which is an amazing option). I was escorted to finance to do all the signing - then to the car where Roger personally attached the temp plates. I drove away at 4:15pm. 

With the 9 or 10 cars I've previously bought/leased there's always been an element of up-sell, annoyance & immeasurable waiting. To me, this operation was based on transparency, efficiency, and respect - clearly designed to attract referrals & repeat customers. 

I still can't get over it. Well done.",5.0

190,"September 01, 2018","My BMW 328i had a failure where I couldn’t roll up my windows or use the blinkers, with an error message saying to turn off the car because of an electrical error. I had the car towed to Rusnak BMW on a Sunday. The back windows would not roll up and the service dept. was closed  so they let me park the car in a secured area. To add to the stress, I was going out of state the next day for business but they assured me everything would be fine.

The next day Tig let me know he had the car and would  be checking it out, By the end of the day, they had diagnosed it and said it was the FRM Module and it should be covered (even though the car was out of warranty). Tig said he would have to get authorization to do it and he would get back to me. By noon the next day, Tig emailed and said the car was done, In addition to the original problem, they fixed 2 other recall issues and did an oil change and washed it!

I can’t say enough good things about their service and friendly staff! Thanks Tig and Rusnak BMW for the exceptional service!

243,"March 12, 2018","I have generally had great experiences with this location, however, my last appointment left me both perplexed and frustrated.  I scheduled an appointment after hearing a strange noise in the rear of my SUV.  I thought perhaps it was related to some previous work that was done and asked if it could be looked at. The dealer associate assigned to me explained that the noise I was hearing was coming from items that were located in the front pockets of my door.  Inside my front door were a CD case and a pair of sunglasses. I explained that the sounds could not be from those items, as I had heard the sounds prior to putting these items in my car.  He then suggests that due to the rain, the diagnostician could not assess properly and suggested if I hear the noise again to return and they would take another look at it. He then proceeds to tell me that the charge from removing my CD and sun-glass case was 90$! He then say that my warranty was expired and I needed to make the payment for today's service. I explained that I purchased the extended warranty, to which he then suggests, ""that doesn't apply to your CPO."" I then explained that I was assured that the extended warranty covered my car from bumper to bumper, as per the BMW  employees and manager that sold the car LESS than one year ago.  He again responds that this information was not accurate and explained ""They (meaning BMW employees) get people to  buy those warranty's but they don't cover CPO vehicles."" He continued, ""besides, I have to pay my guys for looking at your car.""  I was furious and again pleaded my case that the cases in the front door of my car were not responsible for the sounds I heard from the rear and further more, if the rain impacted the assessment, an honorable associate would have suggested I come back when weather conditions were more permitting. He then agreed to lower the price and again suggested that the technicians needed to be paid. I did not argue, but did let him know that I felt insulted and taken advantage of. 
And to top of my experience, my front license plate cover was bent and hanging off the bumper when they returned my car. He offered half of an apology and stated, ""we have new workers up there..."" Not sure how that is related to the damage done to my personalized plate cover. He says, they bent it back into place the best that they could...
Just not a good experience.
As previously stated, I generally had good service, but this last appointment left me concerned that I have been taken advantage, especially with regards to the purchase of my extended warranty. 
On a positive note, the cashier was really nice and apologetic.

280,"November 30, 2017",There was a group of us waiting for our cars to be returned. I had received the text saying it was ready and when I came a couple of hours later i sat outside for almost 30 minutes waiting for my car. A very nice lady waited longer without saying anything. I had to pick up my son so I was a bit more stressed. There were people milling about and I get that it isn’t their job and I get that management has decided to do the cut backs but it affects your customers. My complaint is directed to the people who made those decisions not the workers who have to manage the fallout. I gave it 4 stars for that reason but if I rated based on everything else it would be a 5. If you don’t fix it I would think it would affect your business.,4.8

I waited for the service to be completed.  My service was completed in a very timely manner.  After the service Robert informed me that the service technician had found inappropriate wear on the inside of my R/R Tire, and needed to be replaced.  This was probably because the alignment was off.  After looking at the R/R tire, I observed the inappropriate wear on the R/R tire and decided that it would be best to replace it immediately and then get the 4 wheel alignment completed.  On 8/16, I replaced the R/R tire, after observing the R/R tire off of the vehicle, I noticed more extensive damage to the tire, and realized that I had driven my vehicle with this tire long distance, it would have blown up or shredded.
I am Truly Thankful to the technician who worked on my vehicle and was attentive enough to notice this.  A major crisis or accident was averted.  Thank You, I love being your customer on my 5th BMW.",5.0

352,"March 28, 2017","Short version regarding ONE of my issues with Rusnak service. 

My 335 convertible has been leaking for over a year w/o a solution. I have brought my car in 3 times with 3 different service advisors in the last 13 months with pictures. Two out of the three times I have been told the leak cannot be replicated. 

This last time there was a rude comment on my discharge papers, ""If the roof is wet and the door is open water will get in. That is normal & expected."" I have explained this leak multiple times. The roof is not open, the door is not open. The roof does not leak when driving in the rain. The leak occurs when the car is parked for a long period of time (12-15 hours) during a rain storm; therefore, just spraying the roof with water will not replicate the leak. 

My past visit I was blown off and not even contacted from my service advisor other than a text my car was ready. My car was not ready, it still leaks! 

I live in Santa Monica and the 45 minutes each way to not be taken seriously has to stop. I have recently contacted BMW since Rusnak service does not seem to take my concerns seriously. 

In addition, there is a clear issue with courtesy cars at this dealership. I was made to feel guilty for asking for a courtesy car during 2 or my 3 visits. During the 2 visit (December 2016) I was sent to enterprise, where I paid to upgrade because the allowed amount would have covered a kia. Once I returned to Santa Monica I was asked to come back to Westlake, return the rental and pick up a courtesy car. I spent 4 hours driving that day for an issue I had previously brought my car in for.  

On another note, I really enjoyed working with my salesman, Claude.",1.5

468,"March 16, 2016","Had a wonderful experience buying a factory-built to order 328i through the AmEx car buying program (look online for the AmEx program instructions). I do have an AmEx card but I don't think you must have one as no one ever asked me for my card number (online or in the store).  Darren Evans at Rusnak gave me the lowest quote by thousands of dollars compared to other SoCal dealerships in the AmEx program, and also compared to 2 other car buying services.  Because it was a custom-built car, I was afraid there would be no ""deals"" and the price would be very high.  This was definitely true with the other dealerships' AmEx quotes, and also from the other 2 car buying services.  I don't know how Darren did it, but he gave me a great price which was most definitely a ""deal"".

I am a very busy professional, and I really appreciated the excellent and courteous service Darren provided.  I met with Darren in late January and placed the order for my car.  Darren updated me via e-mail every step of the way as to the day my car was built in Munich, the date it shipped out of Germany, and the date it arrived in Port Hueneme.  I picked up the car at Rusnak 8 weeks after ordering it, and it was absolutely perfect and exactly as I had specified.  Darren is such a professional and absolutely wonderful to work with.

My introduction to my new BMW and all its amazing technological features was provided by Jess, my assigned ""BMW Genius"" and he was also wonderful.

544,"September 09, 2015","I recently purchased a used 2013 335i convertible from Rusnak, the process was incredibility smooth.

A couple of days before I had a live chat session.  All my questions were answered and the next day I was put in touch with Claude. He ensure he understood what type of BMWs I was interested in. We narrowed it down to leasing a 2015 2 series or purchasing the used 2013 3 series. After a couple of emails back and fourth I decided I was more interested in purchasing the 3 series. 

The day of my appointment, the 3 series was ready for me to test drive. Claude had all the pertinent information ready (e.g., milage, warranty, what was replaced, etc.). It was such and easy transaction because of the wonderful BMW warranty. 

In addition, the financial process was equally as smooth. All my questions were answered, payments over 5 years vs 7 years. The difference in putting $8,000 down vs $5,000. I loved there was no oversell for additional warranties, or tire insurance.

Claude even followed up via text the next day and an email a couple of days later.

I have to say the most amazing part of my experience was Claude giving me the pink Rusnak license plate out of his office. This was the first car I have purchased on my own (without a co-signer) so I now proudly display the pink Rusnak license plate on my leopard bulletin board at work.

If you read my other reviews you can see that the first one was right after I purchased the car and everyone was still very friendly and outgoing, but the minute I gave them a 5 star review for my sales experience that was it. Done. I am very disappointed with this. I was supposed to get a ""genius' to help me with the tech package and I still am just trying to figure out the day to day useful features. According to all the sales people everything following the sale would be nothing short of stellar customer service. I have yet to get a follow up call to see how everything is going.l Wow. I can tell you this is not the Lexus dealer. I will not be buying anything from Rusnak again. My next car will be a Lexus (again) and it will be sooner than later.

585,"July 18, 2015","I purchased my 2012 BMW X5 last November with 18K miles and a factory warranty. I brought the car in for its first service (in June) ( the computer told me) and oil change and to fix the tire air sensor.   After the oil change was completed and supposedly the air tire sensor ""was fixed"",  I was told to call the service rep if I had any more issues.   Well within a few minutes of leaving the dealer the light flashed on and off and has been doing this ever since. 
Well I took it in today for another schedule service apt. rear brakes (the computer told me too.) and to again check out the tire air sensor. I was told this would take one or two hours, so I waited (I was told they were out of loaners) (note: work is over an hour away and home is  1/2 hour away).  After over 3 hours,  I got the car back and was told  that I would have to come back yet again to fix this complicated tire air sensor - a couple of days will be needed to troubleshoot this issue.  Which I don't really care that much about.  Air sensors are problematic on a lot of cars.  I got in my car and the car said service check (computer) in two thousand miles (about maybe 6 weeks for me).  So back at the dealer soon.

Well  I regret buying a BMW.  It is an excellent ride. I didn't realize I would be spending so much time at the dealer for service for a late model car with relatively low mileage.  So not worth it unless you live within a few minutes of the dealer.  And yes the dealer will give me a ride anywhere!  

I work for myself so every hour I am sitting in the dealer is an hour I am not getting paid for.  I wish BMW would take some consideration for our time and realize not all of us have time to visit the BMW service dept. every month.  I hope to get rid  of this vehicle soon.   So now I have to bring the car back for the third time - for the same issue. Oh well that's what I get for buying  a BMW",2.2

609,"August 04, 2014","Brought my car to get Diagnostic because my car had the issue to start up on few occasions .

Service adviser said my battery was aged and I do not drive much so I had to replace battery. I drive about 1000 - 1200 miles a month so how much more should I drive? 

Anyway, I authorize to replace my battery after We went over the price which was mention to me the price will include the installation and programming because this battery must to be reprogrammed.

Before I came to Rusnak BMW - Service Center I called them and confirm the price of the services and battery also called few other places to compare and everyone told me I must to program the new battery.

My SA came and brought my invoice and key and said go head to pay.. after I paid I request to talk to technician because I had few more questions.

my 1st question was to Tech guy if they put the AGM battery? He was not sure so he left back to the shop to check.. while I was waiting I asked sale person in parts if the part # on invoice is AGM and he said yes and there is only one battery available. ok, Here is Tech guy came back and telling me We made mistake and put the AGM battery in your car and charged you for AGM battery and did not program it but your car needs the different battery because I had original battery not AGM and I have 2 choices now.
1. replace my battery with original type batter none AGM and it cost of the battery about $100 less.
2. I can keep the AGM battery but need them to program it and it will cost me more now but I already paid for installation and programming as we discuss before authorized the replacement of the battery in the amount of $187.50 that is about 1.25 hours. of labor they told me. and I am already there for over 3.5 hour.. 
Tech guy the programming might takes few hours now because they would need to program all modules may be etc.. it's more complicated stuff. but I did my homework before coming there and I know what has to be done to install the new battery and I know what it takes.. I also confirmed before coming with part department there is only one battery fit my car and its AGM and he said it must to be programmed and the same SA told me it must to be programmed but why the story changed now? 
SA and Tech guy start to make me believe that I am wrong and the previous installation price of $187.50 does not cover programming.. SA told me They can remove the battery and put my old one and I can leave.. and it's after over 3.5 hours wait there.. 
After some explanation to them They agreed to try to take my car back to the shop and try to program it if that will take less than 20 minutes then they will do it at the above price. Guess what? yes, they could do it . SA show me page with show there is highlighted AGM battery program instruction.. and why it's needed but when I asked her for copy she refused to give me.. but then she went to talk someone and came back and said ok she can give me the copy.. and I got my key back when I asked to talk to tech guy my AS said he is gone for lunch and rest of them are busy so come back next time oil change and car checkup.. hmm.. Do I want to come back? 

I am not sure now if the car really was programmed or not.. and if my car was really tested? I did not see full report of the test.. the only way to check to take for another diagnostic to another shop which cost $150 - 200 again. 
Do not come to this place!! they're careless to your car and safety of your life. Be careful!! they only care that you pay more !!! and come back for more service..

p.s. I had the battery tested before coming to this shop few times in 2 different shops and both of them told me my battery is good !!! no need to be replaced.. and I have a copy of their test .

I'm so glad that he did.  Jeff was wonderful to work with, very helpful and friendly.  He found the perfect car for me, no hassles, and I didn't have to spend hours and hours at the dealership.  Darren Evans with financing was equally helpful and wonderful.   He made the process easy and painless.  The entire staff at Rusnak has been friendly, gracious, and helpful!  I had my car less than 24 hours when my husband noticed a few scratches on the bumper.  I called Jeff and true to his word, he immediately took care of the scratches for me.   Wow!  I'm very impressed with their customer care. They don't just tell you what you want to hear, they back it up with actions.

I told Brett, ""I'm not here to buy a car, i' m just looking.""  to make sure he knew that I was just researching at the moment. After one test drive, from my own asking and a crazy invoice to have my car repaired at the other dealer I was hooked. Absolutely no pressure or crazy selling tactics here just good people selling beautiful cars. 

This was only my second time buying a car and after learning about Rusnak BMW, and all the details that go into both the automobile and the dealership I will only buy from here. Best experience by far. Knowledgeable on the products and the service is above and beyond the usual. After the deal was made I was introduced to Darren in finance who made the paper work fast, simple, and easy. Which anyone can tell you is the most boring part of buying a car.

618,"June 12, 2013","The outstanding service at Rusnak is one of the reasons to own a BMW. Most appointments can be arranged on a next day basis. If the service appointment is likely to be short, I prefer to wait for the car. An hour or two in the very comfortable lounge is an opportunity to regroup, answer email, etc. without interruption. Renee Norris and Larry Koh are serious about getting things right the first time---and willing to put in the extra effort to identify the source of driver concerns. They are also great about responding to questions directly in ways which have saved me a trip to the dealership for issues I could address myself. 

Above and beyond the call of duty: We ran over a piece of metal causing a flat tire in the desert on the way to Las Vegas---Rusnak staff (Larry and company) located a replacement tire for a 650 convertible 8 miles from our location, saving us a long flat bed trip back to the city. Again, they found a place which would have in their posession THE TIRE in one hour (not just a tire shop or dealer)-- and install it immediately. Finding a tire for a 650 on an immediate basis can be a treasure hunt in the city, much less the desert. ",5.0

620,"May 31, 2013","i find it strange to write this however i believe outstanding service deserves acknowledgement: I have owned 5 BMW's - the last 2 purchased from Rusnak. I would never consider another dealership for servicing my car and/or i was in the market for another BMW.
I took my car in for its 1 year service (on short notice - called at 10am and wanted a same day appointment). The receptionists, the one who fitst answered and at the service dept were pleasant and extremely courteous. I arrived nearly an hour late. Problem? Not at all, Chris, the service manager promptly accepted my car and expedited the paperwork. He asked me if i wanted my car cleaned. I said no, it had been recently washed.
Less than an hour later i got a call from Chris that my car was ready. I picked it up, once again such a courteous cashier (no charge), receptionist and the guy who delivered the car. The car looked like it had a 5 hour detail. 
The salesman who sold me the car, Jeff, came to say hi, chatted without any salestalk. Remembered all my details although he has probably sold hundreds of cars since them.
No, i was not paid to write this! Just think in this day and age when this kind of service is rare, it deserves recognition.
I have dealt with many other dealerships, including other BMW shops and none come close.

631,"December 29, 2012","The worse experience of my life. After spending 2 days of negotiations and finalizing the price on a used car (X6 2009 listed at $40,882) , The salesman (Frank Poor) got the approval from the management to sell us the car at the agreed price ($37.250). 

After driving back to the dealership to close the deal, the General Manager (Niel) doesn't want to sell the car at this price.

We were outraged and offended by this and asked the salesman to see Niel. He came and treated in a very unprofessional and arrogant way. I showed him the written agreement that we exchanges through text messages back and forth. But he kept  denying and saying that this is not an agreement.

After seeing Niel's arrogant's approach to treat his customers I told him that even if he tries to sell me the cat $10.000 less, I won' t buy it from this Dealership

Anyway I used to be a very happy customer of RUSNAK for years and I was bringing my family who moved from overseas to buy cars at this dealership.

637,"May 09, 2012","I purchased a certified BMW from Rusnak in Westlake California earlier this year.

Following an inspection from another dealer, I found out the radio needed to be replaced at an expense of $1,000.

The main menu feature of the electronic controls will not work. I am afraid to find out how much that will be.

There is a crack in one of the wheels and it looses air quite often. Obviously this is a safety issue in addition to an inconvenience.

I have contacted Rusnak many times and cannot get the consideration of a return call or an email acknowledgment.

Knowing what I now know, this is what I should have done.

- Go to a dealership that will stand by what they sell.

- Buy closer to home so you can expect dealership support.

- Thoroughly inspect the car or make sure you get a profession opinion on the vehicle.

- Get a 30-60 day warrantee on big ticket items.

645,"February 09, 2012","These guys are horrible.

Purchasing the vehicle:
I negotiated the price on a CPO 535 over the internet (fine).  Sight unseen, they offered to match a trade-in quote I had from Carmax (I faxed in advance) on my Land Rover Discovery.  Fine--more convenient for me than arranging a ride to the dealership.

When I got there, the whole process took 4 hours.  Unbelievable.  Price, trade-in and financing were settled (in writing, via email) in advance.  For 60-90 minutes they appeared to be haggling about the trade in.  No excuse.  I bought a new 5 the same way from South Bay BMW and the process took less than 1 hour.

Follow ups:
As a result of my feedback on the sales process, the Sales Manager, Drew, made several promises (free tank of gas, free full car detail, partial reimbursement for a blown run-flat less than 1 month after I drove off the lot) which went unfulfilled.  I sent 2 notes to Ken Christ--the overall SM for all of Rusnak.  First time Drew called me back immediately--and again did not follow through.  Second time, nothing.

The car:
Has been great, I love it.  But the day after I bought it, the passenger power seat went out and I was back at the dealership.  Also it turns out the tire I replaced twice in one year was due to a cracked rim.  CPO indeed.

The bottom line:
I had a friend recommend these guys to me after he bought two cars there.  I will never buy a car from them again, and I would go out of my way to stop any friend from buying a car there.

It's a poorly run sales office, a poorly run service team, and anyone who believes this dealership's CPO inspection is reliable, is a fool.  This dealership is terrible and is to be avoided at all costs.  I have said as much to BMW also (this was my first CPO, and my second overall).",1.8

From my first inquiry, Beshoy was very responsive, courteous, and honest. Beshoy, Jeff and the internet team at Rusnak make every effort to take the BS out of the car buying experience and help you find the car you're looking for at the best deal they can give you. As an example, when I went into Rusnak, Beshoy sat down with me and turned his computer screen to walk me through available inventory in the US and to show me a transparent view of the dealer costs, taxes, and markup for the vehicle. Once we found the car I wanted, we did a bottoms-up pricing negotiation, where all we really negotiated was the dealer markup, since the car was sold to me for what they pay for it. This is opposed to the typical top-down negotiation, where you have no idea what the real cost of the vehicle is for the dealer.

After we shook on a deal, I worked with Nicole in their finance department. She was an extremely nice, open and honest with me. I also spent an hour with Jeff walking through all the features of the car. You can tell with Beshoy, Nicole, Jeff and the rest of the team at Rusnak that they're looking to build a long-term relationship with you and make you a part of their family. Mission accomplished with me.

I called up mid December to see if there were any incentives to terminate the lease early and get into a new vehicle. I was directed to Jeff Kaltman - the Internet Sales Consultant. I told him that I'm the kind of person who doesn't like to spend his day at the car dealer negotiating and wanted to get into a new vehicle without the usual ""back and forth"". He said, ""Email me what you want, and I'll get right on it"". Within a couple of hours he had found the vehicle that I was looking for. We hammered out a deal and I was extremely happy with the outcome. Unfortunately, the vehicle was at another dealership and that dealer was holding the vehicle for 48 hours, because another customer had shown interest in it! At this point I should note that the car in question was one of three that were available in the entire western US. It was a very slow 48 hours. When I finally heard back, the car was sold. I was extremely disappointed and was going to give up. Jeff asked if there was another vehicle I was interested in. Luckily, another car with similar specs was available. Once again, we negotiated on price and this time there was no other parties involved (Jeff made sure of that). I'm now a proud owner of my third BMW, all thanks to Jeff Kaltman. Throughout the process, he was very responsive with my questions. He was helpful, accessible, easy to deal with, and forthright in his numbers and information. It is because of my very positive experience in dealing with Jeff that I plan on retaining my business through him for many years to come.

Being that this was my first lease, I wasn't aware that upon signing paperwork, I would be presented with ""protection packages"" that indeed cost more money.  This was okay, however in presenting the options to me, the Financial person neglected to inform me that I would NOT be held accountable for dings, dents, or scratches smaller than 2 inches in diameter (as this is considered normal ""wear and tear"".  This information was actually presented to me by the portfolio manager several days later when I stopped by the dealership to have a small scratch buffed out.

Thankfully, I opted not to purchase the additional dings, dents, and scratches protection at the time of signing.  It would have been extremely disappointing to have committed to that payment, without being presented all of the pertinent information.",5.0

The car wasn't even on the market when I asked Marc if they had a 335is coupe, but he kept me informed throughout its journey to the lot. He gave me detailed descriptions of every feature that the car had and I was very excited when I realized I found the perfect car. 

When the day came to purchase the car, we were done finalizing the deal within minutes and the deal we received was excellent! Once we were done with the paperwork, Marc helped me set up the car and I left the dealership that day with a huge smile on my face. Marc made our BMW buying experience a great one and we will certainly recommend him to all our family members and friends. Thank you Rusnak BMW Westlake for such a pleasant car buying experience!

We made our purchase decision based on facts in a hassle-free way.  No haggling.  Rob took the painful back-and-forth negotiations out of the equation and we came to a decision in a pleasant and direct way.  He was great.  Programmed phones, explained features and answered questions, followed up questions later by phone and email.  Welcomed me back on a quick lunch break and escorted me through the parts (or is it toys??) department, introduced me to the service manager.  I'd had a bad experience with another BMW dealer in LA, and had vowed never to vote with my dollars again on BMWs simply because of the poor service and the ""you need us more than we need you"" attitude that dealer conveyed.... post-purchase.  Rusnak got me over that in a few hours.  I look forward to bringing the car in for service.

How they stay in business amazes me.  By the way, my wife's car, a Jag, was purchased from RUSNAK JAGUAR and they do dot seem to have the same service problems as BMW. Maybe the JAG service manager can train the BMW service Manage the meaning of SERVICE.

714,"August 08, 2010","Went in looking to find information on a car and was treated very poorly by the first salesman to approach.  It's possible he was having a bad day, but it did not excuse his rudeness, condescension and overall aggressive behavior.  We headed down the road to Bob Smith BMW and were treated with respect and terrific customer service.",1.0
715,"April 25, 2010","Worse dealer experience ever.  Made it to dealer at 6:45PM after an hour drive only to have the salesman (don't have his name because he didn't even bother to introduce himself) try to shoo me out the door because wanted to leave at 7:00PM sharp!  His attitude was pessimistic and I felt like he was trying to get rid of me even though it was pretty much a guaranteed sale since they were the only dealer that had the vehicle I wanted.

The only positive experience from visiting this dealer is that I've learned how not to treat my own customers.",1.3
716,"February 23, 2010","In in 2008 I purchased a preowned 2005 525i. My first experience was to have my car in the service department 21 days of my first 30 daysn of ownership...all due to window tinting issues that I had to solve myself by calling other window tinting shops and telling the Rusnak service people how to fix the tinting issue. Eventually I had to call a sales manager to help me because I knew that they would care more about customer satisfaction than the service department.  This was my first experience (not good), BUT anyone can make a mistake.

My second service experience (other than regularly scheduled rountine maintenance), was last Friday night, I lost my keys.  My husband drove to my office (45 miles) to bring me the spare key.  The spare key did not work.  I called BMW Roadside Service and after carefully explaining to them what had happend with the key, they sent a service provider to jump the battery.  BUT MY KEY DIDN'T WORK so the jump guy left.  I called BMW Roadside Service back and they told me that I would need to be towed.  By the time I got home it was five and a half hours later.

I went to the service department the next morning (a very unhappy person)and asked the service manager if it was reasonable for me to expect my spare key to work...he agreed, everyone agreed, except for one service man (Andre) who explained to me that the battery in the key would go dead if the key wasn't used.  He explained that the battery in the key recharged when in use.  I told him that he was the FIRST person who had expressed ANY KNOWLEDGE of this and the ONLY person to explain it to me.  He assured me that everything would be OK and that he would have the key sent out immediately and arrange for a loaner car for me.

My husband picked up my car today and the service man (Andre) told him that our 50,000 mile warranty was no longer in effect because we had 56,0000 miles and charged us $50 for the deductable against my 100,000 mile warranty. I don't care about the $50.  I care that I am tired of chasing good customer service.  They all knew I was about to cry.  They all knew that I AM A CUSTOMER.  And none of them cared enough to VALUE me as a repeat customer. One poor experience is just a single experience.  I have only had two experiences with them and both were unacceptable, uncaring and certainly short sighted.  I am a tired Rusnak customer.  They wore out my nice. I wonder how much they spend in marketing for a new customer.  They had me and gave me away to another BMW dealership.",2.3
717,"December 22, 2009","Estimates are always over the roof. Often, several trips to the dealership required in order to complete the job properly.  Even though I always leave my callback phone number, service adviser never calls me back when the work is completed. Expect to receive second rate service if you didn't purchase your car from them.",2.4
718,"June 29, 2009","Excellent service overall. Attention to the customer is paramount. Over the past 4 years, we bought three BMWs from Rusnak Westlake BMW, a 325i, a 328i, and a 7 series. Each time we got a great price, excellent service, honesty and integrity. (Bought all three from Aaron.) Always able to get for service, and the service people are honest. The service scheduler, Renee Norris is extremely helpful. I definitely recommend this dealer. It's a 30 minute drive for us, but we wouldn't go anywhere else for sales or service. ",5.0

720,"March 12, 2009","Just completed my first lease return.

I read this web site and feared the worst - so many negative postings.

My experience today was fantastic.  Car was inspected promptly at appointed time and paperwork was processed and I was on my way.

I was paranoid about get nickel and dimed for chips and dings and tire wear.  Nothing happened.

I brought them a clean car with normal wear and a few miles to spare.  They gave me my release paperwork.

I will definitely be giving them my next BMW business.",4.8
721,"February 20, 2009","I have never dealt with such a rude salesperson in my life. I should have walked, but they had a very rare 6 speed. I felt so bad about how I was treated that I called the General manger Ken Christ. I knew as soon as I talked with him where the arrogant jerk attitude came from. It took him 3 weeks (!!) to finally contact me after I called literally 10 times. Ken never apologized for his rude salesman, and always seemed distracted and like he could not care less. I told him I was a returning customer (!!) and had never been treated this way before when the OLD GM was still running the place. Ken Christ just did not seem to care. No apology. No 'how may I make this a better experience?' No 'I am shocked to hear this.' Nothing. This made me wish I'd never given Rusnak my business. I will never return there, or to any of their other dealerships either. I wish I could tell 10,000 people to stay away from Rusnak. ",1.2
722,"January 25, 2009","An impressive showroom with solid selection.  Mark was professional, knowledgable and patient. I suggest doing your homework before entering the dealership and sticking to your game plan.  The dealership will make money...it's just a matter of how much.  My experience was quite positive.  I highly reccomend Mark W.

723,"November 10, 2008","AVOID servicing your car here. They will KISS your ass if you have a warranty to keep you coming back. After that...they are rude and will RIP you off.  Bought a certified pre-owned BMW 3 years ago from them and purchased extended warranty. Under warranty, had both seat mechanisms, all door locks, alternator, AC accuator (spelling?)fixed at less that 50000 miles (FYI: this is my first and last BMW). This summer took it in for a mini oil change one week before my warranty expired because an oil warning light was on and was told they would look for stuff wrong since I still had a warranty. It wasn't time for Inspection II yet (had a few hundred miles to go).  Said everything looked great! 2 months later took it in for Inspection II  not worrying too much since they did a ""visual"" inspection at the mini oil change. Keep in mind this is a low mileage car (55,000). They found 3000 dollars worth of stuff wrong with the car (oil around here, this torn..etc...etc..) Stuff they should have ""seen"" at my mini oil change while under warranty! Two weeks later, after paying them thousands of dollars, the inspection light came on and they said I had to pay for the diagnostics test as it wasn't related to Inspection II. The guy I spoke with was super rude and defensive. He must be used to my kind of phone calls. My husband has a newer BMW with warranty and we will NEVER take it back to Rusnak! It's Steve Martin in Camarillo or Beverly Hills BMW from now on. Also..if you are going to buy CPO BMW...look on the internet on used car websites. We did this with our 2nd BMW. All the dealers post their used cars. Make them negotiate. It works! DON'T buy from Rusnak though. We found them to be the highest priced and most unwilling to negotiate. ",1.0

725,"April 04, 2008","Horrible experience with the internet sales department.  Even if they had the perfect car for me, I would never buy it from them.  I was on the market for a used BMW, got there, and they were rude the entire time.  The vehicles I did look at were a mess.  I gave my business to a different dealer.  I've bought plenty of cars, this place was by far the worst experience I ever had.

Had one of the little retards argue with me about the thing - little bastard never even read the manual, which I pointed out to him to get him to fix the problem. Eventually I did get my problem solved half way through my 24mo lease. Brought the car in to service for 15K miles and as I was driving away the low washer fluid warning flashed me. WTF they can't even check the damn fluids? WILL NEVER GO BACK and may never buy a BMW again.",1.0

Last experience I was shuffled from one ""service"" person to another and stood around for over 40 minutes waiting for the ""next"" service manager.  They had already taken my car back and left me standing there.  Absolutely pissed by that time, I tracked my car down in the back lot and LEFT.

731,"January 11, 2006","Bought 2001 540i Sport. Beautiful car. BMW Certified to 100,000. Was told that the car had just had a Phase II service, early @ 45,000 miles. Bring back for oil every 15,000 miles and no major service again until 90,000 miles. After purchase, battled big time to have agreed items fixed, and had very poor support. Took car into Valencia BMW @ 60,000 miles for oil change, only to find out Phase II service was never done.  Webber investigated by asking salesmen Stratmeyer and Prince, and they told him they didn't remember telling me that, so, oh well....And the maintenance free car until 90,000, well, that wasn't accurate either. He did tell me that the part that Valencia claimed wore out should be under warranty, but again, no one will help. I paid $1100 for service on a car just puchased as a ""BMW Certified Car"" Contacted BMW North America numerous times but they refuse to support their customers, no contact at all with me. Have asked numerous BMW web sites about BMW support, and they all tell me you are on your own, it is non-existant. Great Car, I love it, but I can't trust BMW and will probably dump the car.
