0,"April 20, 2020",We’re happy with Clemente Bacani’s service. He took care of all of our concerns and we’re grateful for his knowledge and professionalism in helping us with our purchase.,5.0
1,"April 12, 2020","When I went to Riverside Hyundai, I was not fully decided yet whether to buy a Hyundai Tucson, Toyota RAV 4, Mazda CX5 or Honda CRV. But after the test drive and the excellent service I got from Clemente ""Clem""  Bacani, I went ahead and purchased a Tucson Ultimate. Clem answered all my questions with honesty and he never pressured me into buying a car. But, soon after I had the vehicle, I had major issues with the dealer installed option, TheftPatrol. But a million thanks to Clem and to Ms. Veronica Smith from the Finance Dept, we got this issue totally and satisfactorily resolved. 

As a word of advice, to future buyers. I strongly advice that you do not get the TheftPatrol. This device has major and serious flaws. This is not worth the money, AT ALL! 

If you ever decide to visit Riverside Hyundai, make sure you ask for Clemente Bacani. I can assure you, should you run into any issues, he'll make sure that it is addressed to your satisfaction. And should you decide to purchase a vehicle from this dealership, make sure that you ask for Ms. Veronica Smith from their Finance Dept. ",5.0

16,"September 30, 2019","Deceptive and dishonest, and even sexist, sales practices at your dealership.

28,"January 26, 2019","19 year old daughter brought her 2016 Elantra to the Riverside Hyundai dealer to replace a truck latch.   The very simple fixed turned out to be $275.00.    I was charged $130 for a part I could of bought for $39.   Labor for a 15 min job was $135.   My daughter got a totally different sales pitch then I ever did when I had brought that same car to the dealership.    The Sales mgr , Jim, was very rude and dismissive until I told him that I was going to give the shop a neg review.    He changed his tone and wanted to negotiate the price.   I refused.   I feel that they took advantage of my daughter and was deceptive.    I will never buy a car from them again, and course never take my car back to that shop.  ",1.0

31,"March 08, 2018","I chose hyundai because of their 10 year/100,000 mile warranty. Came to the local Riverside Ca hyundai dealer, bad desicion!
Sales person, one of the nicest people I’ve dealt with. Service writer, another one of the nicest people I’ve dealt with.
Carlos in fincance, total disgrace. Very rude individual who changes interpretation of written documents to his advantage. Tries to fool customers into things when the written material is stating it a certain way. Doesn’t care for what the customer has to say or what the customer needs, only cares for his numbers (after all that’s what the finance department’s main goal is, numbers).
Richard Michaelson, the owner of Riverside Hyundai, another pathetic individual who doesn’t care about his customers or their personal information.
He showed my personal profile to another customer just because they said they were related to me without my consent and without me being present. Doesn’t matter if the person says they’re my sibling or if they say they are me, before showing any personal information he needs to ask for identification or ask for my consent. Michaelson is a rude individual to speak to and i definitely will not do business again with Riverside Hyundai when it comes to purchasing a new vehicle. As far as service goes, My service writer’s customer service is great and that’s the only one thing that brings me back here for service.
Service manager Jim, haven’t dealt with him so i cannot say anything about him, other than he seems to be a nice guy.",1.2
32,"January 01, 2018","Deceptive practices - This dealership's web-site and emails offers all show window sticker and a specific sales price offer - what is not disclosed until you are at the dealership is the fact every car at the dealership has dealer added options (lo-jack; fabric coating etc) which are required and add almost an additional $2,000 to the stated offered price of each car.  The offers do include ""fine print"" which states the offers are subject to any dealer added options - so this dealership operates within the law, but uses very deceptive practices.  There are plenty of other dealerships in the area who do not use these ""bait and switch"" practices - After leaving Riverside Hyundai we went to another dealership and purchased the vehicle we had gone to the dealership to test drive.",1.0

116,"October 01, 2017","DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME DRIVING TO THIS DEALERSHIP.

Be very careful when buying a call from Riverside Hyundai.    The price they have on their website does not include any dealer add-on.   Although most of the times you can choose to add these services, Riverside Hyundai forces you to buy them.    They put LoJack on every car at the cost of $1,200 and then tell you there is no way to buy a car without.    Therefore, the price you saw on their website would be much higher than when you walk-in.   This is a clear bait & switch.   

They say that the fine print says that the website price does not include dealer add-on.   However, if I don't have a choice of not getting the dealer add-on, then the price of the car on the site is not a true reflection.

VERY POOR BUSINESS PRACTICE.",2.4

143,"September 12, 2017","Very unhappy because I was forced to buy LoJack, a $1,200 feature which I didn't want, because it's on all of their cars for their protection while the car sits on their lot, which they did not disclose up front.  The sales rep told me later that's why all of their cars have it.  I asked to have it removed and they told me they couldn't do that.  They charge the customer for it, essentially making the customer pay to protect them, and it makes them a lot of extra money over the life of the loan.  It's a scam.  Turns out, my local dealership in Orange County doesn't put LoJack on any of their vehicles and told me they never get cars from Riverside because they all have LoJack and then they have to charge the customer for it.  So what looks like a good price quote isn't. They also told me that I would get a discount on my insurance for having it, but turns out Auto Club does not offer any discount for LoJack.  Unsuspecting buyer beware!",1.8
144,"September 11, 2017","I purchased a 2018 Genesis G80 sport in June, 2017.  That had a great price, and the employees are nice.  However, there are 2 things you need to know so that you don't get taken advantage of, as I was.  Many cars say that they already have windows tinted and LoJack installed - and they will upcharge you for these additions unless you object.  I have learned that LoJack is NOT already installed and the windows are NOT already tinted, but they will try to trick you into accepting these additions unless you object.  They also charge MORE THAN RETAIL for the LoJack.  Secondly, in my purchase, they agreed to a finance rate of 1.9% and then did it at 2.99%.  When I learned about this change, I called them and they said that since I did not catch it when they did the paperwork (there is SO MUCH paperwork!), that there was nothing they could do about their mistake.  So, please be more careful than I was about reading every detail of the contract because they tricked me, and there was nothing I could do about it.  PLEASE BE CAREFUL!  ",2.6

Francisco was not only cordial but actually listened and showed me two vehicles that filled the bill !  We test drove the vehicle , he explained the different features . I don't make impulse decisions . He understood .  That's why  the next day I purchased from his dealership !",5.0

441,"July 05, 2016",Overall I was satisfied with my car purchase in the sales process however my salesman did promise extended warrantees that would be included at no additional charge and then when I arrived management told me that he misspoke when I clearly made it clear that these would be included and he affirmed before I drove to the dealership.   But they ended up having to change to $100 deductible extended warranty in order to get what I was originally promised with a zero deductible.    I also would've liked if the salesman would've spent more time showing how to use some of the electronic features in the vehicle like navigation and audio controls most of which I had to figure out on my own after I left.,4.3

I looked at my contract and the dealer listed my trade in as a year older than it truly was, causing the value to be less. IT is the responsibility of the dealer to do their due diligence in these matters.  They are suppose to be professionals.  In truth, my value was much higher.  The contract was not correct.  So while I love my car, had a relatively nice experience, they put erroneous information down costing me $700.00.  It is an unfair business practice and does give car buying a bad taste at times. I love my car, I have recommended people to the dealership, but I am talking to the attorney general regarding the erroneous contract to get that corrected.",4.0

558,"August 06, 2015",I had a great experience in buying this new car.  I was shown a variety of cards that could meet my needs until the perfect one was found. I was in no way pressured and they helped me to get every deal & discount available.  This was so different from every other car buying experience I've had so far.  I am recommending all my friends to check this dealership out.,5.0

561,"July 28, 2015","Overall we enjoyed our visit at this dealership and dealing with the salesman and his manager. From finding the car, test drive, price agreement and financing it was just great. I will definitely comeback to this dealership and promote Hyundai cars and refer my relatives and friends.",4.8
562,"July 24, 2015",I was concerned at first about financing because of some dings on my credit. They exceeded my expectations and I believe got me the best deal available. They worked with Capital One and got me a great %. Very friendly and informative people. I never felt pressured and felt they took my needs and expectations to make the deal instead of trying to get the most out of me.,4.4
563,"July 24, 2015","I would like to thank Kelvin for helping me out throughout my vehicle purchase. Very friendly and still professional. For being the age I am, he didn't look at me as just a teen but as the adult that I am,(most dealerships won't do that) and got me into a brand new car. ",5.0

568,"July 07, 2015","As a Divorced Woman I feared buying a new car. My experience proved me wrong and I would do it again if it were here.  I had my Jaguar for 13 years but she was starting to cost me too much for repairs and I was afraid to take her anywhere out of town. Now I feel safe and have the comfort of any Expensive car out there.

Thank you so much for taking the fear out of buying a New car from a 71 year old Woman.

Sincerely,
Dyann Hussey 
One loyal and happy Cusomer",5.0
569,"July 03, 2015",I was very impressed with all of Hyundai's staff. Everyone was very proffessional. The orignal salesman was not able to answer all of my technical questions but went above and beyond to find someone on site that could.,5.0
570,"May 24, 2014","This place has got to be one of the shadiest dealership around! First of all, as a precautionary measure, I called the dealership to talk to someone to ensure that the specific year/model (2014 Genenis w/tech package) of the car I was looking for was available. Of course they said it was there. Upon my arrival, the person I spoke to wasn't available, the model wasn't on the floor, so I wasted my gas and time driving there. They then attempted to put me into another vehicle (same model/year, but not MY color), so I listened to the offer. We went back and forth on pricing. They finally came down to $35,700 before tax, licensing, and doc fees (roughly $3,800). I balked the offer and countered one last time, so apparently the sales manager (Emad Mahroom) was so offended that he came up and out of his chair with the offer sheet in my face (I'm seated) and ask,""Excuse me sir...how much do you want this vehicle for?"" I responded ""$33,000"". He then crumpled the offer sheet right in my face and said have a good evening. I was extremely offended and humiliated; it took all of my tact and professionalism as a service member (Marine) to not blast off on this jerk. I then gathered my family and we departed the dealership. The next morning the sales associate (Madj Alhaddad) calls me back up to apologize and sweeten the pot on the vehicle. They still wanted the $35,700, but then threw in an extended bumper to bumper warranty + the add ons the dealership placed on the vehicle (tint, interior/exterior coating, Lo-Jack). I was enticed to say the least. After careful consideration and counseling from other dealers in the area I was convinced that this was a great deal, so I confirmed the deal. $35,700 + docs, fees, and taxes. Once again as a precautionary measure, I asked the sales associate to document the details of the sale via e-mail. The pricing breakdown: MSRP, the add ons, the warranty, the docs, fees, and taxes, interest rate/term, every little detail. As expected, they didn't provide it to me. About an hour later I get an e-mail telling me that they want to restructure. 48 HOURS OF GOING BACK AND FORTH! I make the commitment, and they basically reneged on EVERY promise that they quoted me on via phone conversations and text messages (on more than one occasion). I feel cheated and lied to. Riverside Hyundai should be ashamed of themselves for these shady practices and tactics. Don't go to these jokers unless you want to get played with! Especially Brian ""Big B"" Wilson. The only bright star I saw in the whole ordeal was Madj the sales associate. She was extremely professional and did everything in her power to give me a solid deal. Someone gave her the $35,700 quote, but no one is owning up to it. I have text and email traffic stating this offer, and plan on speaking with an attorney today and the Better Business Burial for some justification.",1.0
571,"June 06, 2013","Went for service and was never kindly greeted. Esteban was my service advisor and I was in line waiting for him to get my paper work started. I was number three in line. David the second employee there was basically not doing anything and not assisting Esteban. David should have taken the role of customer first and helped Esteban with the long line. Now here comes the problems and young good looking woman enters and now all of a sudden David is helpful. I was pissed. I finally after 35 minutes checked my car in and ask for my rental with Esteban which he never called and I went to the waiting room. After 30 min of waiting for my rental I asked Esteban what's up. He then said oh sorry I forgot and I will called them right now. So I was even more upset. Now I'm in the men's room doing my thing when Esteban come in looking for me holding the door open where other customers can see me and says "" Enterprize is here now. I said I'm not interested in the rental and I will talk with you once I leave the restroom. Once I exited the men's room I asked Esteban I have been here over 1.3 hrs and I want my car now. He than retrieved my car which of course had not even been started on and I cursed Esteban out. I was so angry but since I needed service I took my car to Redlands and got the same job done for $50.00 dollars less. The very next week I traded my car in for a 2013 Toyota. My experience with Hyundai is nice cars bad service. I will never buy another Hyundai ever again as I don't ever want to be treated with the most worst customer service ever.",1.0
