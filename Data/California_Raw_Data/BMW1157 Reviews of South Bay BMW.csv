1,"March 09, 2020","First, let me take full responsibility as to what happened to me.  I knew what to look out for and it was my own fault.  I am not going to name the sales people but I have nothing against the trainee as he had nothing to do with the beating I took.

Leasing a new BMW was a 5 hour ordeal with high-pressure sales tactics and expert manipulation on their part.  My head was starting to pound and I fell for it.  I got a bad price on the car under the guise of it being the ""Costco"" price, was ""mislead"" (I won't say they outright lied but knew how to dance around my question), and then padded BMW's money factor by about 20%, which I only discovered after the papers were signed.

I have had experience with other BMW dealerships and was never treated this poorly.  Whether or not you are able to catch every move they make, dealing with a company like this is unpleasant at best.

Leasing a $50,000 car should not make one resent the xxxx thing and I look forward to my 3 year sentence being over.  I will definitely never deal with McKenna again and, depending on my resentment of the stupid car over the next 3 years, will likely never purchase another BMW.

It's your money; give it to a dealership who earns it.",1.8
2,"February 24, 2020","To whom it may concern,

I'll start off by saying I have been a customer of South Bay BMW for more than 5 years. I never had an issue with any advisor until 2 weeks ago when I took my car there for service. I had a horrible experience with Jorge Gonzalez. When I was asking him questions, he was giving me 1-word answers, he was not very helpful, he was unprofessional and very rude. 

On 02/11, I took my car in to get checked out for a few things: my car was making noise from under the vehicle on acceleration while while driving, Jorge said it would cost $215 to do the diagnostic and I agreed. Then, the backlight of the odometer was out, he said it would cost another $215 to find out what's wrong with the backlight because it's a separate issue. At first I didn't want to do it because it's a little pricy, but I eventually agreed to get it checked out. Lastly, my left brake lamp was out. I had changed the bulb a month prior but it still wasn't working, so I asked Jorge to check it out as well. Then, we sat down and he had me sign some papers. I agreed on the $430 to diagnose 2 things on the car, then I asked him to call me if we need to change some parts to discuss pricing because I'm a little bit tight financially right now. He said OK, and he also said ""it would take ONE DAY.""

The following day, 02/12, I was waiting for him to give me an update, either a call or text message, but I wasn't getting anything. At around 1:30pm I called him a couple of times but he wasn't answering. I figured he might be busy or having lunch. So I just sent him a text message. He didn't respond until 3:00pm and all he texted was ""vehicle is waiting to be diagnosed."" Then, I asked him when does he think it will be done. He responded with ""looking at tomorrow"" I still have the text messages to prove this. At this point, I started to get upset because of poor communication that was being displayed by Jorge. He also promised one day, but that was not the case. I understand the shop can get busy but if you're not certain, please don't give false promises. 

On 02/13, he called me at around 4:00pm advising me of what's wrong with the car. He said the noise that the car was making was caused by emergency brake line rubbing on drive shaft and it would cost around $1,600 but I declined. He said I also need to change the carrier and the socket for the left brake light and it would cost $400, but I also declined.. I'll be honest I'm not really a car person, so most of the things he said to me on the phone seemed indefinite and unclear to me, so I asked him if I could come and meet him so I can get a better explanation. I live near South Bay BWM, I told him I can be there by 4:15pm, but he said he was leaving soon, and that it would have to be the following day.

Friday, 02/14 (3rd day), Jorge texted me at 8:06am saying that the car was ready. I got there at around noon. He knew I was going to ask him some questions, but as soon as I got there, the very first thing he told me was ""just go to the cashier and pay"" and he points towards the cashier's direction. Now, I want you to please understand how RUDE and UNPROFESSIONAL that was. Then, I told him I needed to ask him some questions but before I get to finish my sentence, he gave me the ""give me 1 sec"" finger and picked up the phone and made a phone call (or maybe pretended to call someone to avoid me). I waited about 8 minutes until he hung up, then I sat in front of him and I started asking him questions. Just by watching his body language and hearing the tone of his voice as he was giving me 1-word answers, I could tell he didn't want to talk to me at all. Then, I asked him if you provide a copy of the diagnostics and he said ""whatever paper the cashier gives you, that's the only paper you're going to get. What I told you is what's wrong with your car."" At this point, I didn't see any point of talking to Jorge anymore. I just went to the cashier and paid $430. Then, I asked the young lady from the cashiers if I could speak to the service manager and she introduced me to Charlie Kim. I explained to Charlie the situation and I told him I was really upset and disappointed, and he patiently listened and apologized. Then, I asked him the same questions and I asked Jorge and Charlie patiently answered all of them, then he gave me his business card afterwards. I was impressed with the way Charlie handled the situation. 

Overall, it was a very bad experience. Jorge Gonzalez was rude and unprofessional and I had never seen or experienced anything like that at South Bay BMW.

Sincerely,

4,"February 13, 2020","I’d like to bring my worst experience I had from your service team to your attention. The incident just happened today during receiving service from your dealership. 

I made a service appointment a week before and my appointment was at 9 am today. I showed up in your dealership’s driveway on time. However, my service advisor didn’t even come out until 30 mins later. In fact, he sent someone else to check me in. I finally got checked in around 9:30. 

Your team made me wait in the car for 30 mins while other people who came after me got checked in as soon as they arrived or no longer than 5 mins. Once the service was completed, I was advised to go to the cashier to sign the paperwork. I got to share my worst experience with the service manager, Charlie, as he happened to stand there chatting with the staff. 

When I was ready to give the paperwork to get the car pulled out in the driveway, I was asked if the car hadn’t been washed, would I still take it as is. Don’t you think the car should be ready before the customer was advised to go to the cashier and signed off the paperwork? Also, I was asked when I checked in if I wanted the car to be washed and I said yes to the service advisor. 

So I went back inside to speak to Charlie again and explain my frustrations and all of a sudden, one of the cashier staff wanted to join the conversation between me and the service manager. Once I responded to her comment, she got mad and asked me not to talk to her since she wasn’t the one who serviced the car with a rude tone. The service manager had to stop her from misbehaving to me. I didn’t remember her name otherwise I would let you know her name as well but I’m sure you can find out from Charlie.  

This was the worst experience I’d ever had but most importantly I didn’t expect this type of experience from a BMW dealership. This was also my first time getting my BMW serviced at your dealership and your team couldn’t even give me a good first impression. 

I’d had BMW for the past 4 years and I’ve never had to write any complaints to Long Beach BMW. They were always fast and treated customers with respect. Clearly, some of your staff haven’t been trained to meet BMW’s standard. Sadly, I decided I will not go back to your dealership again. 

Thank you for your attention. I hope you understand my frustrations from the experience I had today and I hope you will address this with your staff.

5,"January 30, 2020",I've always been happy with South Bay BMW. especially my service advisor Anderson Chowchilla. You can't imagine how resourceful and how comforting it is to know that your vehicle is being maintained strictly. I have all 3 BMWs in my lifetime and South Bay BMW has been the best for me I appreciate everything Anderson and the dealership has done for me. And yes I would recommend any of my friends or family to consider South Bay BMW when purchasing a new BMW or servicing their current BMW it is a 10 for me. Thank you I appreciate you all,5.0

8,"December 20, 2019",I brought in my BMW 535i for service to this dealership and they damaged a door. I did not notice the damage when I picked up the vehicle and when I informed my service coordinator Jorge Gonzalez a couple of days later he refused to take responsibility. I tried speaking to his manager and others but they all kept lying. They kept saying that the damage did not occur with them. Multiple body shops told me that this sort of damage occurs when a door is kept open while bringing down a car on a service lift.,1.0

11,"November 30, 2019",Darryl Kwock is the worse service adviser ever. Completely rude and insulting to customer. Got a late message from him ask me to pick up my car by 6:30. Even though I know I have 24 hours to return I still try best to rush back before its closed. I got there 3 mins before close ( check the camera time stamp!) He started arguing with me because he is all packed up and trying to leave early. He then threatened not to let me pick up my car also yelled at me saying he will charge me for extra the rental fees! He further turned around to instruct the other girl don't help me. OMG I can not believe BMW such a high class brand used such low class at the front line to service patron customers. So shocking disappointed! This service adviser has no intention to service for sure. Will not return South Bay BMW to get insults again!!,1.0
12,"November 20, 2019",Took my car in recently for a standard 30k mile service.  Silvio was very professional and easy to talk to. I made request to pick up my car by 4:00 pm and the car was ready for pick up by 11:00 am. ,5.0
13,"November 10, 2019","I came into the dealer willing to learn and ready to buy on a CPO i3. Settled on two cars with an agreed upon price, but I needed my wife to drive and experience it herself the next day before selecting one of the two that were identified.  One car was dirty and the interior had a few noticeable stains.  
While the sales person, Wael Gad, said he would get the exterior washed for the next day, I also asked to get some of the interior stains wiped/cleaned.  He stated that they could only do that during a car detail of which only would happen if the car was sold to me!  He was not really motivated to try to help out even though he wouldn’t be physically be cleaning the car himself, as someone else from the cleaning crew would be doing it.  I wasn't asking for a full detail, but simply try to wipe some of the stains off the upholstery to see if the stains could come out or not.  
Plus, Wael wasn't knowledgeable of some of the questions I had about the car (which can be understandable to a point on an electric vehicle) but more importantly he wasn't willing to find someone else there who could answer them.    There are several other examples of my poor experience that I can explain but am leaving out for now. 
The next day when my wife and I decided to settle on one of the two cars, I was ready to buy the vehicle based upon the price we had discussed the day before.  Then Wael came back and told me that that price he gave me was only if I financed the car even though I had specifically asked the day before if the price was for either all cash or financed, which he said the day before that it was the same either way.  I realize that sometimes dealers can get incentives for customers financing, so I asked ahead of time.   
Finally, I asked to speak to his manager, so he brought me to Harlan Seyton, who was sitting behind the counter along with a number of other sales people.   I asked Harlan if I could speak to him in private.  He looked at me and said he was too busy to get up from his chair and speak to me on the side!  What horrible customer service with that attitude.  I do want to acknowledge that Jeff Samhat, who was sitting next to Harlan, got up and we spoke professionally to each other.  However, Wael and Harlan should not be in sales.
I left the South Bay BMW dealership ready to buy that day (on a car that had been sitting in the lot for two months) but left discouraged and disappointed with the lack of customer service from the sales team.  
It doesn’t end, as the next day the CPO Manager, Christian texted me asking if I had any questions.  I texted back asking him to call me back.  However, no response.   What does that tell you…
I ended up buying another BMW at Auto Nation BMW who was very straightforward and trustworthy.  Save your time and don’t shop at South Bay BMW.

14,"November 09, 2019","Worst experience in any business. I stopped going there years ago but had to bring back my BMW because of a poor tint job( water under tint)They claim I bought a cheaper tint which I would of never done and on my receipt I have no proof because product is NOT written anywhere. They want to give me cheaper non UV blocking tint! This dealership lies so much about everything. They only care about the money, NOT the customer. Service is always trying to get money out of you for anything, tires, alignment, things you don't need, etc. Turnaround Employee rate is high. Wait time for your car is ridiculous.

I asked for a quote on a car, then comes back and says I’m going to quote a payment on a different. What??!!! I asked him to bring me the numbers on both cars, which he did. And that’s all sheet wrote. I asked is that the best you can do, and he said yes. One pass to the manager and that was it.

31,"July 12, 2019","First off, I have a lot of experience buying and leasing cars, including BMWs. I have also leased a car from this particular dealership in the past and everything went smoothly. However, my most recent experience was very disappointing and I won't be returning unless they make some personnel changes. 

I had a poor experience with Marc Cleary. My lease was coming due and one of Marc's jobs is to review the car for damage. I had an appointment for 10am and arrived a few minutes early and checked in. The receptionist couldn't find Marc and I waited. She paged him again, no response. 20 minutes later, I see Marc talking to some other associates and I had to approach him to remind him of the appointment. He then proceeded to review check the car without an apology. Review goes fine and then he starts to try to sell me a car. 

I let him know what I was looking for and the approximate monthly payment others were quoting me. He scoffed at the payment I gave him and started aggressively asking which dealership I was working with. He then proceeded to have me ""prove"" to him that I had actually received a quote. He was basically insulting me and suggesting that I was lying to him. I proceeded to show him the text message from the other dealership and he became irate and flabbergasted and said there's no way he could come close to that payment. That's all fine. I get it . You can't match the other dealership but there's no reason to get upset and be unprofessional. Maybe he was having a bad day or maybe he's just unhappy with his life in general but he certainly should be treating customers this way. 

I will not be returning unless Marc is no longer there. This dealership lost a customer due to Marc's unprofessional behavior. I ended leasing the vehicle from another dealership, my third BMW lease.

I visited South Bay BMW about 3 times not expecting much, but each time Al Asghari put forth his best effort to help me. There was no pressure, Al help me along the way to find the exact car that I wanted. I was very specific on certain things, and Al made sure I got what I ask for.

We checked out X2 and he had great recommendations and advice to wait for X1.  We then asked to test drive the X3 and this is when it became clear he just wanted to get rid of us.  He left us on 3 different occasions to go get keys to test drive, each time he came back to clarify what features we wanted the third time we waited at his desk for 20 minutes, it became clear he disappeared so we just left.  We went to another BMW dealership and got the X3 within 2 hours.  Don’t know if the sales person thought we weren’t serious, but we needed a car that day and didn’t have time to wait.

To be clear, I knew this deceptive practice existed, as I had been a victim of it in the past, but I thought it was only executed when the victim/customer arrived at the dealership. South Bay BMW proved me wrong. I had been in talks about a specific CPO car for about a week. We agreed on a price, and I made arrangements to visit the dealership in person later that day to test drive it and buy it. Well, as I was getting ready to head to the dealership, I noticed that some unclear verbiage had been used by the salesperson. When I asked him to clarify that the price we agreed on would be upheld, he pulled the bait and switch. He said that our deal wasn't in fact available, but that he had another vehicle on the lot that I might like. Word to the wise, bait and switch doesn't work--not in person, and not telephonically.

41,"May 25, 2019","Be so careful with this dealership.I bought my car yesterday from them, and I regret it so much. This dealership did not take the responsibility, and I believe public should know about this dealership, which their customer service/ professional manner does not fit their ranking.
1) I had seen some other car at Beverly Hills branch, and then called this dealership to ask of they have the same one with keyless option too. The guy checked, and told us they have the same car with all the packages + keyless entry. We went there, took a look at the car, and did not test drive it, just checked the keyless to make sure.On the way back home we found out the guy did not tell the truth and we trusted him, but the car does not have blind spot/lane change amenities which we had clearly told him we wanted. Now we can do nothing just because we trusted them.

2) In finance section, they had changed the  numbers so that we would have to pay $600 more for the drive off, and it was not an honest mistake. Because when we understood and told him, he first made a call and then corrected it. We also had to pay almost $300 extra for a warranty, and we asked so many times why we had to pay, and the finance agent told is this is how the computer calculates and he does not know!!! 

3) Unfortunately, the existing manager was not a supportive one to go to and let him know all about that. When we were talking to him how we have gone a far distance just to see the car and  agree on the price, he told us He would never do do as he respects his own time. I got angry when he told that, but “?” Brought us back, and tried to make the deal, that I wish I had stepped out, or never had gone there in the first place. Even the owner did not respond our claim.

I regret leasing a 56k car from them. Recommend you be careful with theses guys too.",1.6

I described the model of car that I was interested in, and how much I could spend,  new 2019 X4 and that I would pay $46,000 in cash respectively + tax and registration
Will responded that he has a vehicle for 46,445, with the options I requested Convenience Package and driver assist package. I responded that $46,000 was as much as I could spend. Will replied back with $46,000, so we set up an appointment for 05/22/19.
I arrived at appointment and was greeted by Will, we sat down and Will began completing the paperwork.. to make a long story short, he came back with the following:
-Price of the car would be $46,445.00 + tax and registration
-I cannot write a check for the vehicle, I would have to finance close to $50,000 and make at least 4 payments
I was dumbfounded that he had blatantly lied to me, just to get me to the dealership.
I asked him why he mislead me previously via text, he said that""... me saying that I would pay cash for the vehicle could also mean financing..."" Really come on now. In regards to the financing part, he said that he failed to mention that via our previous texts.. "" I walked away with out a purchase.. A short while after Will sent me an apologetic text saying that he did in fact fail to provide me accurate information, and that he did mislead me, and understands if I don't return to SB BMW.
This type of business tactic is completely wrong, unjust, and should not be condoned by any business owner.
I am also going to send my experience and very poor business practice, along with additional  concerns to BMW America,and the local BBB.

His whole demeanor towards me changed. He started talking to me in a condescending way and it was to the point I almost backed out of the car deal. Nonetheless i stuck it out and moved on.

I came in for the ""VIP"" car wash approximately a week later. During that visit, my BMW struck another car or object. I didn't realize it until i pulled it into the sun. I notified the valet team who moves the cars back and forth. They told me they didn't know if I did it when i pulled out. Frustrated, I asked for a manager when I was instructed they didn't work for BMW but an outside contracting company. Not much was done to rectify that situation.

Now the last issue. I had my car towed in for service early one morning with an appointment. After writing up my car, I was informed there wasn't any loan cars available and Id have to rent through enterprise. When I went to the counter, the lady was rude and loud with my personal business and at the end of the interaction told me I couldn't rent a car. I spoke with upper management about the issue and notified my service advisor I would wait for a loan car to come in. Danny McKenna told me everything would get sorted and I'd be on my way.

Farthest from reality. I was contacted by an unknown person at the dealer who told me I would be handled soon. Six hours after sitting at the dealer, I was notified that i was banned from receiving a loan car because I didn't live close to the dealer. That's false, It was a miscommunication on their part. John Hall and Enayat Sharaf were the only one's who could lift that and wouldn't. It was ok to take my 1,500 to service my car however not provide me transportation because they misunderstood something. 

I reached out to Enayat myself to resolve the issue and maintain a business relationship with the service side of the dealer and he didn't return my calls. 

Their VIP program touts free service loaners and car washes however my car always ends up scratched and dirty and clearly loaners are reserved for special clients. I was very loyal to this dealer because the service advisors and sales have always been good to me. Management however, is a different story,

East, Enayat and John Hall need to come off the high horse and see things from the customer side. It's easy to bark orders when you don't know both sides of the story. Loosing one loyal customer might not mean anything however a lot of business comes from word of mouth. My views on BMW as a brand are tarnished.",1.8
47,"January 26, 2019","Very happy with South Bay BMW and Martin Dino. He was very professional, friendly and responsive to emails. With such a large inventory, Martin was able to get me a better deal than any other dealership. Trust me, I tried!
When I came in to test drive the car, he let me drive every car I wanted and explained in depth the features of all my options. Martin was more concerned with me being comfortable and happy with my purchase than anything else. There was no pressure to buy. 
So if you are looking for a great car buying experience, just ask for Martin Dino!",5.0
48,"October 08, 2018","
Four years ago I went to SB BMW to purchase a car but they gave me a terrible price so I bought it from Riverside. However, I decided to service my car @ South Bay BMW.  Then last year I was looking for a new car for my wife. I contacted the dealer and they never followed up with me. I purchased a car from Keyes Audi.  Everything was fine till my factory warranty and maintenance expired recently. Last week I went to for an oil change. The service adviser told me that I also need spark plug replacement and oil change. I knew about the spark plugs because I already changed them.  I was quoted for $450 (vs $100 for labor and $80 for OEM parts @ 3rd party shop). We moved forward and the service adviser ""Kyle Robinson"" told me that they have a ""service special"" for oil change @ $99 (down from 250). Great? He started working on the paper and when I was about to sign it I've noticed a charge ""Client states perform standard scope per key reading"". I asked what does it mean because the price was higher than the actual oil change. He explained that they need to reset the computer readings after the oil change for just $116 on top of the $99 oil change. (I'm not a car expert but I usually research about cars and I knew that resetting the oil/brake interval is a matter of holding a button for few seconds and then holding it for few more to reset the service interval). I asked him if he wants to charge me $116 for probably 30 sec of work and he said "" Yeah, but it's still cheaper if do that than if you go will the full price oil change $250... I confronted him and he was pissed and he scratched it from the invoice. (I was promised a complimentary loaner when I scheduled the appointment, however, he called an Uber to pick me up. That's fine ... Then a few hours later he called me to tell me that my car is ready. My wife dropped me at the dealership and I paid the invoice. I gave the valet the invoice and 15 min later I asked what happen with my car. Few mins later the valet told me that my car is not ready. It'll take an hour to wash it. They completely lost me as a client.",1.4

I stood there for at least 10 minutes before a young lady finally showed up and asked if she could help me. Getting the car to the valet area was another 20 minute wait, even they called for it twice (no explanation as to what was taking so long). The service area needs some signage. Driving in, especially if you are not familiar with the dealership (I’m visiting from out of state) is a crap shoot. I wasn’t the only one scolded by the valets for not knowing where to go when I brought my car in. While waiting for my car two other people were scolded for not intuitively knowing where to go, and what to do.

 The first issue was a, ""Stop driving and add engine oil immediately or suffer severe engine damage. I park on a hill and sometimes that caused a low level warning in the past. I drove to a level spot and still got the warning. I added a quart, checked again and got a ""full"" indication. This seemed wrong as I'd added a quart in the past when low and could see that a quart was equal to about one bar of the oil indicator. If the car was that low, then it shouldn't have been full yet. Suspecting the engine was overfull I arranged an appointment. The brakes were also low in the front. The pads indicated clearly worn and the rotors were almost done, measuring 24.77 mm versus the 24.4 mm as within spec. That's a 1.5% difference.

290,"March 13, 2018","He made unprofessional comments throughout our meeting with him the night of March 12, 2018. I came in with my husband and a friend who graciously offered her help to negotiate, since I am not understanding the negotiating process. 

It was already 11:00pm and Alex Shin made us wait for a very long time because he was ""busy"" with another customer according to our salesman, Martin. We understand that but we were expecting that he will be considerate enough that when it was our time to meet him, he would not waste so much of our time since we all want to go home at this point, again, it was already 11:00pm, we were at the dealership since 8pm, we came straight from work, no dinner!

Since we have negotiated the price with our salesman, Martin Dino, we were then referred to Alex to sign the papers. We waited for a long time before we were able to see him. Alex did not even apologize for making us wait for a long time. 

He offered a couple of add-ons such as: Warranty and Wear and Tear. He continued blabbing for such a long time about the add-ons and why I should get it. I told him I would ask my husband and my friend for advise. My husband and my friend both said no, not to get the add-ons and I agreed. I then told Alex that I am not getting the add-ons. 

He then criticized me and said: ""Why are you asking your friend?"" ""You're the one paying for your car not her!"" I was shocked by his rude comments. Embarrassing me, my husband and especially my friend who was just there to help. But he did not stop there. He further continued to tell me that I am making a huge mistake not getting the add-ons trying to make me feel guilty and stupid. At this point, I said ""No, it's fine"", he then said, ""Ok, just make sure that your friend here (looking at my friend w/ a smirk), will pay for your wear and tear!"" 

I was flabbergasted by his comments. I answered and said, ""Well, this is not the first that we are leasing"". I looked at my friend and she was flustered by his rude comments. He saw our reaction that we were not happy with his comments but he did not even apologize.

First of all, he has no right to tell me not to ask friends and family for advise and then telling me that I should have my friend pay for the wear and tear. If I want to get advise from friends and family, that is my prerogative!

He was very unprofessional and his comments are rude and uncalled for. Had it not for the good service by our Salesman, Martin, I would've not signed the papers and took my business elsewhere. Next time, I will think twice before taking my business to your dealership. You also loss a potential customer because my friend was also in the market for an M2. She is going to BMW Long Beach instead. 

It seems that Alex only cared about making a sale and if he doesn't get it, he decides to be a ""jerk"" and an ""xxxxx"" to the customers. Instead of coming out of your dealership happy, we came out upset and disappointed.

I hope that Alex Shin gets reprimanded as his attitude is detrimental to your business. I am giving 2 stars because our salesman Martin was ok, or I would have given it a 1 star rating.

We had actually stopped by the Santa Monica dealership earlier in the day and were disappointed in the salesman’s knowledge of the i3 model and the rebates offer. In stark contrast, Michael at South Bay BMW, went above and beyond in explaining everything we needed to know. I wasn’t necessarily ready to commit to the i3 but after a test drive with Michael and a lot of questions on my part, I was driving off in a new i3 the very next day. I have to say this was hands-down the most most enjoyable, professional and easiest lease process I have ever been through, and that’s saying a lot. I put Michael through his paces and he was so patient and communicative during the entire process.

I no longer get service due notices from BMW of Monrovia, nor do I get them from South Bay BMW where I have been servicing my car for about 2 years now.   I first tried to fix this about 1 year ago.  At that time I spoke with both dealerships and BMW of North America. Both dealerships stated that it was the other dealerships responsibility to transfer my Teleservice.  BMW North America referred me to the dealerships.  

I brought this up again during my recent service.  My service associate made a call while I was there and told me that he could not fix it to call my old dealership and ask the have my Teleservice transferred to South Bay BMW.   I called my old dealership and was told I needed to speak to the service manager who was unavailable.  I left a message for the service manager and have not received a call back.  Two conversations with each dealership and one with BMW North America and no resolution.  This is very frustrating.    Someone needs to figure it out without any more time or energy from me.  ",4.6

451,"December 04, 2017","Letting go of my E92 M3 was a tough decision.. I loved that car to death, but it was such a problematic vehicle.. I recently purchased my 2011 E92 M3, competition package at Alexander BMW. I thought to myself, “i’m finally getting the car of my dreams.” Little did I know I was making a hige mistake.. Flashforward 3 years later, vehicle is out of warranty, extremly high miles, and paying for a vehicle thats not even worth its value, is when I decide it’s time to let go of my m3 and get into something more economical and new. 
Fe celestial recently helped my brother get into his first car, a brand new 2018 320, and she did a womderful job. Of course it was wise to have her assisnt me since she did an amazing job working a deal fot my brothers car. I told her my situation and she began to get to work findoimg out what would beat suit me. I still owed a great deal on my m3 and was paying a pretty high monthly for it. Originally, the plan was to get me into a brand new M3, but the negative residual just wasnt helping me at all.. So she found an awesome 340 with 6 speed that I instantly loved. Being manual, I could still have some fun and get that “driving experience”, even better though it wasn’t an M.. Of course, you have to give up something in order to reciebr something back, so it was a no brainet.. It had to be done. By doing this, it “washed” away my negative residual that I owed on my car, and was rolled into my new purchase. She went to work trying to get me tbe beat deal possible. First, it wasnt resonable to get into it because I’d be paying the same price as i was paying for my m3.. We’ll I decided to think about it. Going home, my family talked more about it and wanted to get a specific number, if not close to it. We gave them a call and it worked! We came back in and sealed the deal! My old car was taken care of and my monthly payments were reduced drastically! Thank you so much Fe for all your work! 
Juan Ochoa is their geneis member who helps you around your new car and shows you how to get everything set up. Very friendly and extremely knowledgeable about the vehicle.

Honestly, i almost canceled coming in as I was thinking of trying a different brand and I was pretty far down the road negotiating that lease, but Fernando had told me to at least come in, talk to Marc, and see if there was something that could be worked out.

I’m so glad I listened. First, dealing with Marc was a pleasure. I felt like I could be upfront with him. I told him what I was looking for and what I was looking to spend.  The first car he showed me was exactly what I wanted and after a little back and forth we got it nearly exact at what I was willing to spend. It was a great experience and probably my easiest car leasing experience just slightly ahead of my first lease at South Bay BMW three years prior. 

Also, they really were helpful during my lease return.  Something came up through no fault of my own or South Bay and they helped me handle it and still return the lease.

I highly recommend this delearship in general as well as Marc and Fernando specifically as I have only had good experiences and they made me feel like a valued customer.

We scheduled an appointment, however everything after that point just got complicated and annoying. The rep we initially scheduled the appointment with kept changing it. We got a text the day of and said he worked earlier so asked us to come in earlier, which we did. We live an hour from the dealership and as we are moments away from the dealership, we got a text saying no one will be there to help us.....  with that being said in the 9th hour Kevin came in and saved the day and ran through the car with us.  We were also told we could have a car wash but by the time that was communicated it was too late for us to get back one. 

Overall I find this dealership to be a pain in the xxx and complicated. I think the Ford dealship by the LAX Is more organized than these folks..... and more welcoming.  Also what's the point of offering a free car wash to find when shown up for your scheduled appointments they are not offered.

It took almost two full days. When I came to pick up my car, it took over 30 minutes to find and bring it out. First they said they were having trouble locating it. Then they said the VIN numbers didn't match between keytag and car tag. Then they said it was behind other cars. When I did finally get it, it was very dirty...it hadn't  even been washed. I called Willie to express my disappointment at this level is service when I spent so much money and I didn't have to choose BMW.

Initially I was looking for a brand new lease, but he pointed out that the dealership was selling lightly used former-loaners, so we took a look at those. Indeed, that was a deal! 2017 MY, less than 9000 miles at a significant discount! I ended up buying instead of leasing!

613,"July 23, 2017","After being a loyal customer since 2004 they have finally have made it that we will not return. Too long of story , but since the new ownership, the corporate culture has taken a nose dive. They are not at all interested in customer  service, only making the deal. This was exhibited in how our particular problem was handled... or not,.  Bottom line, as we handed over our lease car to obtain a new one, and after negotiating a deal, they told us we could not have the car that we negotiated. Apparently their sale person was unaware that it was not available to lease. ( There is more to it than we are aware of). At that point since our car had been turned in we were carless.  After they tried to get us to take another  one.  of which we said no, they had to give us a loaner and order one for us. While waiting for the car they flunked the course in customer service. During this episode, they sent our sale agent home.. and management intervened!!!!!",2.0

689,"February 28, 2017","We leased a 2016 528i late last week. After completing all the documentation and driving it to dinner we discovered the car lacked a specific feature we had expected. We assumed we were ""stuck with it"" but I wrote Chris a note explaining my disappointment. Admittedly I was very direct and not particularly diplomatic in my language. Chris immediately contacted us and expressed his sincere apologies. He also stated his intention of making it right by us. Over two days he located a car that had the requested features, and the dealership stood behind him and helped us get into the car quickly. Aside from some unavoidable lost time, their overall responsiveness to us was excellent. We will be back for another vehicle when this lease is up, and we will ask for Chris.",5.0

692,"February 21, 2017","So I came here for the first time in December of 2016, two days before New Year's day, because my TPMS light had turned on 4 times since April. I had been reinflating my tires to get the TPMS light to turn off, but since this was the 4th time the light had turned on in a relatively short period of time, I decided to take my car to South Bay BMW to find out what was wrong. Without even having to make an appointment, I stopped by after work and Alen, my new Service Advisor, immediately came out to have a look at my tires while one of the parking attendants backed up the car. He immediately found a giant screw that had lodged itself into my rear passenger side tire that I had missed. So I left my car with Alen to have the tire replaced and I got a very clean X3 loaner to use while my car was worked on. When my car was ready on the 2nd, I got a call, a text, and an email from Alen letting me know (nice!) and it's been smooth sailing since.

My second time here was in mid February, I came in because I was due for a brake fluid exchange. My car's CBS indicator for brake fluid had been red for a week and I finally made time to come in after work. Again, I met with Alen without an appointment. I left my car with him, but when I went to the loaner desk, it turned out that my license had expired and my new one was sitting on my desk at home (doh!). So I got my car and dropped it off again a couple of days later (with my new license in hand this time) and I requested a sedan and got an extremely clean and very new 330i loaner! My car was ready the next day, but I couldn't make it there before closing, so I took advantage of South Bay BMW's very generous 24 hour grace period on loaners and I picked up my car the next day after work before they closed. Again, Alen and his team did an excellent job! Even though I've only left my car with Alen twice, I feel like we're building a good rapport, he's patiently answered all of my questions, and I feel comfortable recommending him and South Bay BMW to anyone looking to service their BMW.

The one thing I wish they'd add to improve the customer experience is contactless payments. Contactless is a shared standard used by Apple Pay, Android Pay, Samsung Pay, Microsoft Wallet, and is even built into the BMW credit card offered by BMW. Check the brochure for the BMW Card at the parts/cashier desk where the BMW Card is clearly pictured with a contactless logo on the front indicating that it has contactless built in. It's disappointing that you can't use the contactless feature built into every BMW Card at South Bay BMW. To the management/accountants/owners of South Bay BMW, I'd like to add that contactless payments DOESN'T ADD A PENNY to card processing costs (not even for Apple Pay), so please, please add contactless payments as a way to improve the customer experience for BMW Card cardholders and Apple Pay, etc. users.",5.0

722,"December 29, 2016","Waste of an inquiry on my credit report..

I called into South Bay Bmw and was asking what's the best lease they are offering on the 2016 -7 series. I was connected to this sales man Mike Yaokim  said I can get you this number on this model: over the phone I appreciated the number he offered to me and he was saying how he can make it happen. (My brother has the same exact car just in white at the same price Mike offered)  All I had to do was go to the South Bay Bmw website and fill out an application to get approved or not. I live in Van Nuys which is about an hour drive from South Bay. I specifically told him to tell me if I got approved or not before I drive out. I was in contact with him through text as well. I submitted- I wasn't able to see on my end what the result was so I just asked Mike. He said you're good to go bro come on in saying ""The application is ready for you to sign when you walk in, Im getting the car washed"". I got there and the whole team looked at me all skeptical just because I am young of and Armenian. I even over heard the finance manager- Chris Smith- saying ""this guys gonna get that car"". I was stunned to have come across an issue like this at a Bmw dealership which I am a loyal customer to. They went back and forth looking for a reason to not give me the car. I'm assuming my application was approved when Mike told me that its all good come on down. I asked Chris why I'm not being handed the application to sign and he said it was my call.

 I wasnt expecting this encounter at a BMW dealer. 

But the dealership was really nice. They have incredible deals. I got my previous i3 from McKenna when at the time I made sure my application was ready for me at time of walk in. I'll just stick to McKenna BMW. ",2.2

735,"December 04, 2016","This was a great experience, for it was my first BMW ever and the experience was fantastic.
I had done my research on the internet for a couple months so it does really help when you know what you want. I spotted my dream car on Cars.com and since I live about 20 minutes from the South Bay BMW dealer, I thought, perfect! This is where I am going to start.
I was pretty ecstatic when my bank approved me for a 2.4% loan on 60 months so I was ready to go.
I emailed the dealership on a Wednesday night and Jesse Gutierrez emailed me back by 8:00 am on Wednesday morning. We made an appointment around 12:00 and Jesse greeted me with a big smile.
We drove the car for a nice while, went on the highway and since I was looking at a 2014 328 I I was able to test the horses! they were all there...
When I told Jesse that I was already pre approved from my bank he suggested that they might be able to do better than the 2.4% I already had so I agreed to try. Bijan, most likely his manager was very nice as well and a very sharp dresser I must say. They ran my credit and got me a 1.9% loan, I was pretty excited already but I asked if they could sweeten the deal a little bit. I wasn't in the hurry after all and they are lots of choices around. He told me he would call BMW and try to get me a better deal.
Well, Bijan came thru! 0.9%! I couldn't believe it. Plus the car came with a 100 miles power train warranty because it is a certified BMW car! Sold! I came back that same evening and signed all the paperwork. They even had genius spend a little time in the car with me to explain all the bell and whistles. Great experience! Great car, I am loving it! Thank you to you Jesse and Bijan and Kevin(Genius guy) ",5.0

768,"September 18, 2015","I leased a 2014 328i from South Bay BMW. When the car was one week old, they examined one of the tires for potential defects. Fast forward to last week, I was rotating tires and found that South Bay mechanics tightened the one wheel so much that I could not break loose the bolts. The other three wheels came off easily.
I took the car to South Bay and the service adviser ignored my complaint. He told me that they will charge $106 for rotating tires and did not bother to look at my maintenance records to verify my complaint. I left and took the car to another mechanic I trust. My mechanic had to use a 3-foot long breaker bar to loosen the stuck wheel.
If a dealer cannot change a tire/wheel correctly and do not have the courtesy to look through maintenance records for a one year old car under factory warranty, they do not deserve my (or your) business.

770,"April 27, 2015","This is my third BMW dealership due to moving. DO NOT take your BMW to this dealership.  Outside the warranty you will be ripped off, and that’s saying it lightly.  If you are still within the warranty you will be constantly fighting with the commissioned service advisors on covered items.  EVERYTIME  I took it in I had to fight with the service advisor. 3 out of 4 times I had to pull out the warranty paperwork,  Call BMW and had them explain that items were covered.  They finally agreed and repaired it but every time I went in for warranty work they wanted to charge me $1000 for something that was wrong.  Most people would just pay.  Even one of the BMW customer service people said that they shouldn’t be doing that. 

Forget about taking it after the warranty.  I took it in since my check engine light was on and my car was barely running.  According to the service advisor, since my car was over 100,000 miles I had to do some routine maintenance work.  When the service advisor called me back he said the repairs would total $8,245.  That was just for routine maintenance.  I asked the guy why I would spend that much on a car that is barely worth $10K.   I had to get my spark plugs changed and coil since it wasn’t running right.  $1,600 to change the coil and 6 spark plugs.  The spark plugs themselves were $650 for 6.  Bosch plugs are $70 for 6.  The coil was $600 . Again a bosch one, $125.  

Funny thing is the next day I got a call asking about my service.  I said it was too expensive and I asked why the spark plugs were so expensive.  She said that the service manager would call me back.   No call back probably because the guy knows it was a rip off.

My past experiences with the service department and ownership have not gone so smoothly, but not that much different than Long Beach BMW, or probably any other BMW dealer. Excellent service comes at a price, with excessively high cost of labor and parts as compared to competent independent mechanics.

We owned a 5 series when my son was 10 years old and he preferred to ride in our Odyssey because of the DVD. He's a teenager now, so the wife wanted to get back into a BMW because she liked the performance. We finished breakfast and decided to sneak a peek before South Bay BMW opened to avoid the pressured sales pitch that usually comes with car shopping. Surprise! Coach Watters was just walking into his office and greeted us with a friendly smile. He asked if we needed any help and we told him that we were just looking around. He told us to continue to look and he will be right back if we had any questions. He returned and walked around with us showing us the different 3 series that were available. He was very courteous and professional and informative and not pushy. My wife saw a car and asked if she could test drive it; he returned with the keys and my wife decided on a different car. He went to get the other keys and even before we left the parking lot he explained all of the features in detail which I thought was unusual for a salesperson to share that much information with just an initial test drive. He asked if we drove the freeways and she said yes, so he let her drive the freeway to feel what the car can do. On the way back he showed us in the parking lot what the turning radius was and the wife fell in love with the BMW all over again.  He even picked us up after we traded in our car down the street. Talking about going the extra mile that's why I'm glad Coach was our salesperson. Even after the sale he called to check in with us to make sure everything was going good.

792,"January 10, 2014","I recently got a sexy, red-hot MINI Clubman, loaded with Sports Package, Premium Package and MINI Connected Package.  You would never have thought that a station wagon could be so sexy.  Obviously, you haven’t seen my new whip.    

So, first things first, I “built” my MINI online, and wanted it exactly so.  Finding the car that I designed was a whole different problem.  You will soon learn that getting the MINI of your design is nearly impossible unless you are willing to wait 8+ weeks for the car to be manufactured and delivered.  If you can be flexible (which I am not), you will be more likely to find a car on a local lot.  So, if you are not willing to wait, be ready to give over on the leather seat.  Not only am I stubborn about my “requirements” in a new car, I’m a bargain shopper.  So, I called around several dealers and even employed car buying services available online.  It took a great deal of effort, but I got the ballpark range of the expected sale amount.  Then, my brother saw how long it was taking me to find a car and mentioned that I should contact the sales person who sold my mom her X5.  Great idea.  After all, it’s the same company.  Grace Kim with South Bay BMW came into picture.  She got a list of my “requirements,” and did her homework.  She came back with several options available within relatively close range.  They didn’t match my requirements 100%, but they were as close to my design as I could find.  Unlike some dealers, who tried to sell me the most basic line solely based on the preferred color, or those who tried to coerce me into ordering a custom made car to be delivered in 8+ weeks, Grace saw the whole list of my requirements and quickly realized that I want a well loaded package and found me several options that I could seriously debate over.  Smart girl.  

After I decided on the car, the price nego was a breeze.  She knew I did my homework and was quick enough to get to the bottom line.  If she harassed me over a few dollars at that juncture, I would have walked out, no matter how much I liked the car and appreciated her savvy research. 

Unfortunately, the whole car buying experience was not without a glitch.  My new sexy ride came with a scratch on one of the windows.  It wasn’t the kind that one could buff out.  It’s no big deal, but it did bother me.  I demanded that Grace do right by me and we explored some options on how South Bay can make me feel better.  South Bay even offered to replace the whole window, but that would be a waste of resources.  I said I would rather we add value to the car by installing an accessory.  South Bay didn’t see it that way at first, but I think Grace came through for me and I got the accessory part I wanted.  It was kind of nice to have the sales person on your side and making your case for you.  

A couple of final points about Grace.  She is a BMW person, so she doesn’t know MINI as well as her X5’s, but that’s no big deal.  The show rooms are so close together, I was able to explore the MINI and MINI sales reps.  Despite this shortcoming, she made the whole transaction as convenient for me as possible.  For example, she had the car delivered to my office to accommodate my busy schedule.  She recommended and negotiated the care/warranty packages with the finance guy (Peter Gianakakos) herself, so I didn’t have to do much but hand over my credit card and put down my signatures.  (Peter is quite a gem himself – easy going and accommodating.)  She kept me posted on the transaction procedure and delivery of the car through the preferred method of communication – texting.  All in all, despite a couple of glitches (which were outside South Bay and Grace’s control), a very satisfying experience.  

Finally, my review would not be complete if I didn’t add that the service guys are fantastic at MINI.  Very much in communication with you and accommodating.  Jesus Orta took care of all my questions and concerns from making an appointment, keeping me posted on the progress of the service, getting me the loaner so I can explore other MINI options, and picking up the car in its sparkling condition.  It’s kind of nice to have your service agent come rushing out the door to greet and help you despite that you are already being helped by other rep.

798,"November 14, 2013","Back in March of this year, I had a bad service experience with South Bay Mini. It was escalated up to Mark Brodkin Vice President or South Bay Mini, and he begged me to give them another chance at service. Against my better judgement, I made an appointment for October 29th because several items had to be repaired on my vehicle. The advisor was nice and the service seemed smooth until I was told several items where on backorder and that my oil pump control solenoid needed to be repaired because it was leaking. She told me that they would need my vehicle for at least a day. I asked her to keep me posted when the parts were in so they could do everything at once. Over two weeks passed and they claimed that front mats were still on backorder but could do everything else. I called Tammy Hernandez and said it is an hour each way for me to come down again to do a half job. She offered to pick up my vehicle and drop me a loaner on November 14th. I told her that day would not work and that I cannot be inconvenience any longer. She said the only other choice was the following week but that she would get back to me. On November 11th, I received a call from Mark Brodkin and Tammy Hernandez on a conference call. I explained the situation to both and Mark Brodking promised to call me the next day (November 12th) by 5PM. Waited all day for Brodkin to call so I could get the vehicle serviced. At 5:15PM I called another Mini dealer (Universal Mini) to see if the floor mats were in fact backordered. The parts manager said they were not and that I can come and pick them up as he was familiar with the problems with them. He said he would leave them with his assistant as he was leaving for the day. At 5:35PM I picked up the floor mats and they kindly installed them. I dropped my vehicle off at the service desk and asked them to perform all necessary service as South Bay didn't. They smiled and said they get several customers per month who had customer service issues at South Bay Mini. At 5:54Pm Mark Brodkin finally called but I missed his call that stated he would call me later. I returned Mark Brodkin's call a few minutes later but missed him. Called Tammy Hernandez on her cell phone and explained to her my dissatisfaction with South Bay Mini's lack of urgency to provide descent customer service. She told me she would speak with Mark Brodkin and call me today (November 13th). At 11:23AM November 13th, I received a call from Mark Brodking and Tammy Hernandez again on conference call. Mark Brodkin was unwilling to discuss South Bays failures and primitive so called customer service and went on to accuse me lying about leaving messages for Kim (Kelley) Skovold Service Manager regarding a BlueTooth issue back in March. In the middle of the conversation Brodkin started patronizing me and my family and that they could no longer satisfy me as a customer. I told him that he and his staff had an EPIC FAIL in Customer Service and that he was trying to turn things around and accusing me of making things up. He was in fact making excuses for his falures as a manager. For the record, Kim Kelley Skovold did get two calls from me back in March of 2013, in fact she called me on November 11th to discuss my review of her and her department on this very website. Seven months after the fact? She must be kidding. Not only I left her messages in march I stopped by and also called Jeremy Guenther. Never a response from either. I have phone records to prove all of the above and will provide for a personal apology by Peter Boesen and Mark Brodkin. Also left messages for Peter Boesen but according to gate keepers like Brodkin ""he doesn't get involved on this level"". Well, may be that is the problem with this culture of substandard customer service.

My salesman, ""Coach"" was extremely attentive to my needs regarding what I was looking for in a new vehicle, the deal itself, and of my time. I decided on the vehicle I wanted during my lunch break and when I came back after work the car had been detailed and all the paperwork was ready for me to sign.

800,"November 06, 2013","Mark Brodkin now owes me TWO detail jobs.  The first time they left my one of a kind historic concourse condition E31 outside overnight next to a series of sprinkler heads.   THE DEALERSHIP NEVER MADE GOOD ON THIS PROMISE.  the next time, they backed my special order 535 into a pole and it took months of pleading before they would take care of that.   Last time I went there, they returned the car to me with grease smudges all over the interior, so I said never again.  It gets worse for this dealership.  All very avoidable too.  Never thought I would find any place worse than Long Beach BMW, but this is it.  And the zoo effect by the nonsensical porters is a total joke -- too many games.

The guys in the Parts Department have always been great though.

Brodkin's job apparently is to go around appeasing people without taking responsibility for anything - obviously it's about eliminating cost and liability for them, and customer satisfaction is not relevant.

So this is now the worst BMW dealership I have experienced in my 20+ years of ownership and 35+ in the family.

Milad is a straight shooter, no BS from that guy. Even thou I was a pain in the butt at times haggling prices he did all he could to get me into the car I wanted. He will not pressure you like many people/places do, give you lines of crap try to sell you more than what you want, etc.. You go in ask questions he gives straight answers and that's it.

My wife and I are very happy we met him. The car I wanted was no where around for a dealer trade so I had to order. I waited for a little over a month and Milad kept my production # pinned to his note board to check to see if any status has changed. He knew I was very excited and couldn't wait for my car so he kept me in the loop weekly ( which I enjoyed, to me that's service )

We were looking at different BMW's and Tyler was very patient and helped us search for similar models with similar features, prices and was very patient. Tyler did not pressure us and had a great chat through the process.  We were given a good dealand settled on a CPO BMW, the Sales process at this dealer went by smoothly, even at the final steps of the sale, the financer Kellie, explained everything well and did not try to sell any extras.
By the time the deal finished it was past closing, there was a little rust on the wheel locks from the car sitting for a while, Tyler tried getting rid of the rust for us as best he could and did not rush or hesistate to show us all of the features of the BMW well past closing and made sure we were comfortable and ready.

Coach and Tyler are very knowledgeable, courteous,personable,and listen

They were friendly and bent over backward while trying to get a sale.  But afterwards, it's as if we weren't worth their time.  Once they have your money, you're invisible.

We were lied to about the car we were purchasing, and lied to about our trade-in, just so they wouldn't have to pay a fair price for it.

837,"November 27, 2012","My wife and I just purchased a 2012 Toyota Highlander from South Bay BMW and could not be happier with the level of service and attention to detail we received.  We live on the other side of town so when we found the car on line I made a call to get answers to some questions about the condition of the car before making the drive across town to see it.  I spoke with Greg, gave him my list of questions and expected a very general rundown upon his return call.  I was pleasantly surprised (if not shocked) at the level of detail with which he answered all of my questions.  One of the main questions was whether the vehicle had been smoked in?  Usually when asking that question I get a, ‘not that I could tell’ response but the sense you get is that best case the salesperson saw the car from the window and never really got close enough to know anything about it.  Greg went to the trouble of turning the car on and running the A/C for a few minutes to make sure there was no smoke smell.  With that news and a positive review of the car from Greg we headed to the South Bay. 

Greg met us when we arrived and already had the car sitting up front ready for us to look at.  There was no waiting while someone looked for the key and then had to run to some back lot to find it.  He answered questions but also gave us the time to look at the vehicle and decide we were interested enough to take it for a drive.  We drove the ‘regular route’ and despite our crying baby Greg was accommodating and asked if we needed to drive it further or over different types of road.  We were getting near closing at the dealership but Greg wasn’t rushing us.  

Back at the dealership we spent a little more time talking and then decided we wanted to talk numbers.  At that point we were introduced to Damien “Coach” Watters who took the reins.  If you’ve purchased a car before, you know that car salesmen love to tell you, “I’m on your side, I work for you” to which my typical response is, then why are you wearing a shirt with the dealership logo on it?  Coach told us the same thing and I was as skeptical as usual HOWEVER, while he does work for South Bay BMW and they pay his salary, he did everything throughout the entire process to make us feel like he really was in our corner.  He really was superb; easy to talk to, courteous and accommodating.  Coach wanted to sell us the car to be sure, but we never felt any pressure.  In fact we didn’t come to terms that evening and we left, disappointed that we didn’t take home the new car but certainly satisfied with our experience at South Bay BMW.

That all happened on a Saturday.  On Monday we got a call from Coach which opened the negotiating back up and by that afternoon we had a deal.  Again, no pressure and all very professional but we went back and forth for most of the day until we reached an agreement, including on financing where they worked to match some already very competitive financing we had lined up.  We wanted the car but were more than willing to keep looking if we didn’t get a deal we were happy with.  Coach was always professional throughout the negotiating.  At least that I could tell, he never got frustrated despite the fact that we went back and forth all day.  He kept it professional and understood what we were looking for.

Tuesday we went in to sign papers and pick up the car.  Coach had it all ready, clean and full of gas.  As we took care of the paperwork all of our dealings with everyone at South Bay BMW were easy, professional and (for a car buying experience) enjoyable.  Greg our initial salesman, Coach our ‘client rep’, the finance department, Chris the sales manager, everyone was superb.

Now for me the best part of the transaction and the thing which will drive us back to South Bay BMW the next time we are in the market for a car.  We had one hiccup as we were signing documents for the car which wouldn’t have changed our minds as to whether to purchase the car but left us disappointed.  We expressed this concern and were told by Coach that he would follow up on it and do everything he could to fix it.  I have heard that from car salesmen before and once papers are signed and the car is delivered you are long forgotten.  I expected the same in this situation.  Again, it wouldn’t have made us change our mind on the car but we were disappointed.  Coach ABSOLUTELY stayed on top of our request, rectified the situation and took care of us.  It was a hoped for outcome but in all honestly our expectation was that it would be forgotten.  The issue (again minor, but important to us) isn’t nearly as important as the South Bay BMW team’s response and handling of the situation.  We could not be happier with our car or our experience.  

Well done Greg, Coach and the South Bay BMW team.  We will be back and so will our friends.

Since I have owned BMW's before, I asked for the exact options and he knew the inventory right away and even knew the key number. We went to go look at the car in about 10 min. 2013 535i with M sport in Jet Black. I was blown away that he knew all the option features as I did. My other experiences with sales reps were that they did not know most of the features of the car. 

It was about 5PM Friday night and we started the paperwork not even realizing that Kevin was off at 4PM. I can hear his phone going off (pretty sure he had plans) but without any issues made the deal work within 45 min. (I was expecting a few hours, the typical transaction). I was in the financing office by 6PM and out by 6:40PM. Kevin had the car ready in the main parking lot and he went over all the features of the car. (he was talking but I did not hear anything, I was busy day dreaming). All I heard was ""free car wash 7 days a week"". What a dealership!!

All in all I think it was the most pleasant car purchase ever in 10 years. I have leased and purchased about 8 cars in that time. I can recommend Kevin Kim and Southbay BMW to anyone who is interested in a BMW. 

The best dealership experience ever!! Five stars to Kevin. Thank you. ",5.0

Gregg met us and showed us the cars and we took one for a test drive.  We were delighted with the X3 performance and of course its handling.  Gregg introduced us to Damien ""Coach"" Watters who guided us in determining the features we liked.  Coach is the ultimate professional and model of courtesy.  A very likable person who didn't pressure us and answered our questions.  The  atmosphere was cordial, relax, business-like and the entire staff is very friendly.  We ended up  driving away with an X3 that night.  We can't be treated any nicer by Coach.  I called him late at night with questions about the new car and he was able to answer in a friendly, helpful manner. He made  himself available to us no matter the time of day.

We chose South Bay BMW based on it's great reviews.  Damien ""Coach"" Watters was one of the very few sales representatives that responded to our email inquiries sent to 
several dealerships.

We were seeking a 2013 BMW X5 with particular colors, trims and features for a specific price immediately.

Coach not only gave us the price we wanted but located a car with those particular colors, trims and features arriving at the port.  

If you're looking to buy a new BMW at a great price, ask for ""Coach"", it was a pleasant experience from start to finish.

887,"September 20, 2012","If you are looking for a BWM you can't go wrong with contacting Mr. Ben Majidi at South Bay BMW. I must say you should be crazy not to contact him before anyone else. 

This is my experience: I have done extensive research and homework to get my new 2013 320i Luxury Line. Like most, I started by requesting quotes around through the whole SoCal region. Ben was the first to reply via email and he did with the most transparency and most fairness I've experienced in the whole extensive and exhausting process. But it was worthed and I'm gald I can share it and save some of you the hassle I've had to go through.  The approach I got from others was to try to get into the financial side of the deal more than pleasing my needs and finding the car I wanted or they would just try to get rid of their inventory. None of that worked from me. So if that happens to you, be firm and step away...unless that's fine for you. I got also pretty unpolite replies without basic formal greetings and such. And the cherrie on the pie was a very rude and pushy phone call I got from a silly salesman at Murrieta BMW. That guy got in return a ""I decide how I spend my money, I'm not interested into doing business with you, have a good day"" and hung up. 
Going back to Ben, he would skip all of that. He would do the most reasonable price and he wouldn't push you in any way. Still negotiate with him, that's your right, you the buyer.
Should you call him I even invite you to say you read my review and you'll be very pleased to do business presureless. He'll try to make you happy.

If you really want to verify what I'm saying is true, I encourage you to shop around and compare.

Btw. I was looking for a lease and his numbers sounded right since the get go. You know that with leasing there is many buttons that can be pushed to change the numbers. Ben was transparent and plenty reasonable.

From my experience these dealerships will make you sweat the most: SterlingBMW (too much playing around with numbers), Long Beach BMW (Polite, but they have the very heavy marking up numbers habit), McKenna (very nice but when ready to close the deal fog started rising around the numbers), Crevier (called, emailed twice and never received a quote, they want you to go there and play their game in their comfortzone), Murrieta BMW (if you must, talk to Gerardo he is great and don't talk to anybody else).

I have read reviews on here and other sites before hitting the market and some of the other dealerships that get good reviews don't make sense with what I have experienced.

Hope this helps and eases those who are looking for courtesy, respect and fair busines.

Mario

Grace (sales) took great care of me from the initial test drive all the way to getting those last few dollars taken off the drive out price.  And Andy (finance & warranty) give me a great deal on extending the no cost maintenance service to 6 yrs/100K.  That buys a lot of piece on mind knowing that all the service costs are included up-front and paid up.

Stephen took the time to go through explanations and any questions we had, and made us feelvery comfortable at the dealership. His total laid back and non-pressuring attitude definitely made a difference and ultimately helped us deciding to go with a BMW X5. Stephen provided in depth information about the X5 and BMW in general, and during our testdrive he meticulously provided insight into the numerous features of the X5. I knew coming in I was in the market for an SUV, and after  deciding between a Chevy Tahoe, a Range Rover, and a Mercedes Benz, Stephen helped me gowith the X5, and I am glad I made that decision. He was patient and thorough in 
answering the numerous questions I asked him over the few hours we were there. South Bay BMW was great in comparison to the other South Bay dealerships I visited in my search for car options. Any by far, Stephen was the most outstanding employee to work with.

Over the years we have never had anything but good experiences with each of the BMW dealers, but our experience with the South Bay staff, Taylor O'Conner and Ron Spurlock was without question the best.  They were professional, honest and at all times doing the very best possible job for the client.  They truly made you feel that they were your client advocate. The same was true for the financial manager, Alex Dawson, who did an equally outstandiing job for us on the financial side.  They each represented the South Bay dealership as integral parts of an extremely well organized professional team and at each point they exceeded our expectations.

He emailed me a credit application and when I was accepted (which took about an hour or so), we made an appointment for Wednesday evening.

I told him that was OK and we met that evening.  Tim was more than gracious, let me drive the car and indulged my excitement at finding just what I wanted.  I thought the price was more than fair, given the very low mileage, and Tim explained all of the maintenance benefits, free car washes, etc. and the additional coverage I should take.  We made the deal on the spot.  Tim suggested the possibility of getting a better price for my old car than the trade in offered by the dealership which turned out to be an excellent suggestion and he picked me up on Friday after I sold my old car.  He took me to see Andy to complete all the paperwork which was extremely easy and efficient.  Andy explained everything I was signing and Tim was waiting with the car in front to show me all the bells and whistles.

964,"March 11, 2012","South Bay BMW is the BEST !!!! I had a problem with my car and had visited several dealerships and not one was able to diagnose or figure out the solution, until I visited the guys at South Bay.  If it wasn't for Kevin Smuckler, I was ready to sell my car and probably not buy another BMW again.  He was the only advisor that actually went the extra mile.  He was able to provide a very knowledgable shop foreman, Craig, that went out on a test drive with me and within a short period of time, the problem was solved.  Kevin always kept me updated and made the procedure painless.  I was so relieved the problem got solved and I fell in love with my car again.  Thanks Kevin, Craig and the rest of the crew at South Bay for making my life a lot less stressful. ",5.0

967,"March 08, 2012","I am giving this dealership the highest grade possible in ALL categories. I am from Orange County and I shopped several Orange County dealers before heading a little further afield to Torrence. I have been driving over 40 years and have NEVER bought a car from a dealer before. I usually buy from Ebay or second hand private party. I decided I wanted a 1 series 135i in black with tan interior. I went to one dealer in Orange County who took me to a 128i when I asked for a 135i. I said that this is not a 135i and the salesman said I didn't need the extra power! He said this because he didn't have any of the cars I was looking for. Then I went to another dealer who was very nice but the car was just too expensive for me. It was a 2012 with every bell and whistle BMW makes. SO I looked on-line and found South Bay had the car I was looking for. Salesman Stephen Gagliano answered the phone at 8:30 at night and we negotiated the price of the car right then and there! He agreed to the price I offered which was a great price for me and I got zero percent interest because it was a 2011 vehicle with only 100 miles on it. My entire 6 or so hours at the dealer went by so quickly because of the professional manner in which I was treated by everyone there. Isaac from Finance is a wonderful guy who is in the right job. He explained everything patiently and when I said I wanted this extended coverage but not that, he did not try to push me to get anything I didn't want. He answered all my questions no matter how basic they were. What a personable man he is. After leaving finance, my car had finished being detailed and the gas tank filled so I was ready for my lesson in what each knob does in the car. Stephen was again so patient and friendly. He went through every little thing with me and did not rush at all even thought the deal was made already. I was so fortunate to have him as a salesman. I felt ZERO pressure to buy and that is why I did buy (besides they had the car I wanted.) I even looked as far away as Florida to find my car. Stephen called again today, the day after my purchase to make sure all was well and if I had any questions. I did, I asked about the type of gas and Stephen advised me about the gas and said if I had any other questions, to call him anytime. What a wonderful time I had at South Bay BMW. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this dealership to anyone wanting a pleasant car shopping experience. It really isn't that far from Orange County and the deals are worth the extra hour to drive out there. Ask for Stephen and Isaac. You cannot go wrong. I shopped the REST then I shopped the BEST at South Bay BMW.",5.0
968,"March 07, 2012","I first bought my car in August of 2011 and I have been hooked to this place ever since. It is the most customer friendly dealership I have ever been to. The staff is amazing. I first bought a 650i in 2011 and recently decided to upgrade to an M6. Damien Watters was my sales representative and the whole process was quick and painless. He made it easy for me to test drive the vehicle, trade in my old vehicle, and most importantly, find financing for a reasonable APR. He handled everything with class. I couldn't have been any happier with the way things turned out.

However, the best part of buying a car here is the VIP service treatment you get here. As soon as you drive up, there is someone there to greet you and show you to your maintenance service advisor. Also, the place has a terrific snack bar and waiting area that always has the best things on television (ESPN, CNN, etc.), and even a shoe shine area! The whole experience is amazing, while you are waiting to get your car serviced. Most importantly, they have a great staff of maintenance advisors. My advisor is Kevin Smuckler- extremely reliable, personable, and knowledgeable about cars. He takes care of me all the time and I have always left 100% satisfied. Just last month, I had to replace my brakes because they were squeaking pretty loud. I was already under warranty. I brought the car in, sat down with him for about 10 minutes, signed a few papers and he set me up with a shuttle ride back home, while leaving the car there. The next day, the job is done, and the car is ready for pick up. He will set me up with a shuttle pick up from my house back to the dealership just to pick up the car. That's huge! 

I highly recommend buying a car from here, also because of the free car washes for the life of the car...yes thats right, not 1 or 2 years after your purchase the car, but for the life of the car, as long as you own it! ",4.8

972,"January 31, 2012","Had many service problems that I brought my new car in for. Obsurd problems that would never happen on most any other vehicle that I could purchase. Most of these had to be repaired during the extended warranty which cost us a minimum of $200/visit regarless.  Module to light the headlamps went bad, they refused to fix it cause they could not find the problem. I drove for years on an intermittent headlamp until I found a private repair shop that would bill the insurance. The dealers excuse, was that when I brought it in they didn't see anything wrong. In the process the ignitors headlamp burned out the lamp given that it continued to fire when the lamp would not light which I had replaced. The tail lights shorted out and both assemblies had to be replaced, which they said was not covered by warranty even though I was well within the timeframe.  BMW came up with a ground wire fix to keep it from happening again, but they never took responsibility for it.  The sun shade broke twice during ownership. I was told it was not covered by extended warranty and is still broken today becuase only the dealer can fix a sunroof and I would never go back for any service, unless BMW is paying for it. Other issues: various engine leaks, front left and right window motors, engine mounts, sunroof leaks, overflow coolant container cracked, washer motor failed, returned after service with a loose spark plug wire which caused it to misfire, all belt tensioners had to be replaced and various over charging for maintenance service that cost 2 to 3 times the independant shop rates.",2.0

It took4 hours to tell they found nothing for $175. I then drove with the tech who diagnosed the problem in 5 minutes. Had to then renogtiate the price for 15 minute fix. After wards my ipod port did not reconize my ipod which had worked fine until this time. They wanted another 175.00 to diagnose. If you are out of warranty go to an independent for half the price.",2.6
974,"January 02, 2012","I purchased a new 2011 535i through European Delivery. When the car was delivered at the West Coast and through the dealer, it has a damaged rear bumper. They blamed it on VDC or port transportation and agreed to reimburse me for the $1600 repair I paid out of pocket and sort out the insurance paperwork through BMW; after it was done, my original salesperson (Phillipe Kahn) had left the dealership. After innumerable email communications and hiding that fact my salesperson was MIA for weeks, they said it was not their problem and refused to reimburse me for it. After four frustrating months, it appears this dealer has systemic management problems and should be avoided. Senior managers would not even return a phone message after someone spent $60K in their delearship. DO NOT BUY A EUROPEAN DELIVERY VEHICLE THROUGH THIS DEALER! An otherwise great experience has been ruined by their internet department whose sole motive is the quick flip/sale with no care about the customer after the sale.

They follow up either by phone or email rarely, and only after you have them contacted numerous times first. 
The issue with the brakes on my wifes 328i started back in October and has now been forgotten. 

They put a car back on the road with dangerous brakes. The warranty was 1 day over and they wouldn't offer a ""good faith"" extension. They then wanted $4,000 to fix them.

I contacted BMW Corporate, still no help.

976,"November 20, 2011","I am torn.  I think their service department is great, but their sales department is horrendous.

Long ago, I leased an X5 from them.  A couple days after I drove the car off the lot, they called to say that they screwed up the lease and charged too little.  We buckled and just paid the difference per month when we should have given the car back.  This was in 2002, and I forget the name of the salesperson.  It wasn't Tim.

September 2011, I test drove a car with Tim, and we talked numbers that were way too high.  I thought I was an informed consumer, so I was really offended when Tim made a snide comment about how a lot of consumers do not know how deals work.  Whatever.  I was in no hurry.  And he was right, I knew MUCH less than what I know now.

So now it's time to shop for a car, and I contact Tim to help him out because he helped with the test drive.  By this time, I made my own excel sheet that allows me to expect a range of lease rates based on the MSRP, selling price, MF, etc.  With sites that tell me how much the car costs to the dealer, I was ready to negotiate.

Tim calls and tells me he doesn't have the car I want.  In the previous contacts, I clearly told him what an ideally equipped car is for me and a range of acceptable options because I figured their inventory would be limited.  Anyway, Tim offers a lease rate, which I thought was appalling.  So I told him politely that I would go another direction and make a deal with another dealership.

Tim comments, &quot;Well, I can assure you that you will have a much less delightful experience there than at South Bay.&quot;

While I appreciate the pride he has in his dealership, I cannot work with someone, who trash talks another dealership.  To me, that is unethical.  Of course, this isn't the only reason.  Ironically, the Internet sales department cannot answer and communicate through emails.  I had to repeat some information when my initial contact already had everything they needed to know.  He insisted we talk on the phone when I wanted to just communicate through email before the deal got more serious.  Why claim being an Internet salesperson if you can't work through the web???



As far as the service department goes, they are phenomenal.  Free car washes, any time, as much as you want, is something new I think.  They didn't have this 3+ years ago.  I brought my X5 and 530i here all the time.  They gave free loaner cars, but now, I think they give out any free loaner BMW model.  DEFINITELY beats BMW SF (at least 3 years ago, don't know about now), which loaned me a little Corolla.  I serviced my 530i and received a Corolla for 24 hours.  While this may not seem like a big deal, it actually is when this kind of thing won't happen at South Bay.",1.5

He wants to make an impression to his boss and meet his sales numbers by over promising and sweet talking the customers during the sales stage.  That's fine with us as long as he can deliver all his promises.  Unfortunately, this is not the case.  As soon as he gets you to fork over your money, he will start to disappoint you.

981,"February 03, 2011","A few months ago, i was interested in buying a m3. 

philip was very professional about everything. everything he says sounds very good, but sneaky and shady people are very good at doing that. i asked him about putting a deposit on a m3, and he said that people dont need to put a deposit down. then i mentioned that i wanted a stripped down very lightly optioned m3 in silverstone II exterior, which is a m exclusive color that is very hard to sell and wildly unpopular. but i like to the color because its a silver with a bit of chrome blue in it, and is perfect for such a sporty car. anyways, so after he found out that i wanted a stripped down m3, he said that he would need a 5 thousand dollar deposit. i was FLOORED! one second he says i dont need to put down a deposit, the next he says he needs 5 thousand. i was speechless. on top of that, all other bmw dealerships only need 1-2 grand to place an order. then i asked if the deposit was refundable. he said no. well, according to california state law, ALL deposits are refundable and I politely reminded him of that law. he then said that the 5 thousand deposit was not a deposit, but actually future payments on the car. wow, he lied right to my face. ive never seen a salesmen create such bullshit so fast in my life. no other dealership in the entire united states does that. to this day, im still astounded that they are capable of this kind of chicanery and deception of this caliber. 

if you are interested in buying a bmw, especially a m car, i would run. these people lie and will try to cheat every penny out of you. here is some advice for people buying a bmw: only pay 500 over invoice, regardless of the model of the car. it doesnt matter if its a m3 or a 328i. a fair dealership will give you that price or lower. dont let someone tell you that they cant give you a better price because you are buying a m car. that simply is not the case. head on over to other dealerships like steve thomas. anywhere is better than here. hell, a crackdealer in compton will give you a straighter deal on a m3 than south bay bmw.

philip khan is also very cocky. he told me to google him on a few bmw forums. well, duh, im on them. thats how i found out about him. he got some gave rave reviews, and others not so. Many say that he is the best south bay has to offer. but after dealing with him, i can say without a guilty conscience that he is a snake in the grass. He appears very nice, respect, mild mannered, and polite, but don’t let that trick you. behind that mask is a dirty salesman trying to squeeze the most money out of you in the dirtiest fashion.  I first checked them out because they said they didn’t need a deposit on a m3, but now they want a future payment of 5 thousand before the car that didnt even hit American soil. His excuse was that they don’t need deposits on m3s that are fully loaded since they are easier to sell if I back out. Regardless, he did not mention that “policy” until after I told him I wanted a lightly optioned m3. You judge for yourself how honest they are.

1117,"September 04, 2010","Some back story... I purchased new stock tires for my '09 M3 from a dealership OTHER than South Bay BMW, name of which I will not mention, and I had that dealership mount, balance, and align my tires and rims. After they completed their work, I paid and took off. The next day I was driving to work at about 75 mph and my steering wheel started to shimmy so bad that I had to slow down in order to regain full control of my car. Pissed off, I took my car back to the dealership and had them re-balance my tires. This time after I left I drove my car around and realized that it had less shimmy, but it was still prevalent. Few days later a couple of my wheel weights came off and flew into my wheel well, so, for a third time, I took it back to the dealership and they replaced the wheel weights... Steering wheel shimmy still there... So I decided to get a second opinion.

Enter South Bay BMW (and more importantly Alex Caicedo, Hep, and the extremely helpful tire team at South Bay) to the rescue... I called Alex up (got his name from all the great reviews on bimmerpost.com) on Friday morning, and he said to come in that same afternoon, I was ecstatic. Got there and waited no more than 2 minutes and Alex was on the scene gathering information about my car to better inform his tech. I took Hep (a resident BMW expert and a really down to earth cool guy) for a spin and he immediately realized that there was indeed a problem. Back at South Bay BMW, Alex had one of the tire experts take a look at my wheels. As it turns out, the other dealership had used the wrong type of wheel weights to balance my rims. Alex had the tire expert balance my wheels and I immediately felt a difference when I took it out for a spin. The steering wheel shimmy was gone and my M3 was sticking to the ground like it was meant to.

I definitely learned my lesson trusting a dealership other than South Bay. I do want to thank Alex and the service team at South Bay for their hard work in resolving the matter in a quick, efficient manner.

1130,"December 04, 2009","I've taken my 2008 M3 here several times for service because it is the only dealer close to my work. Each time, I've waited an inordinate amount of time just to see a service rep- and this is just oil, filter and fluid regular maintenance under the BMW program.  Today it was 45 minutes WITH AN APPOINTMENT, just for the service rep to take the mileage and accept the keys.  Don't some independent shops actually change your oil in 30 minutes or less?  Ridiculous that someone would have to wait 45 minutes to just drop off a car.  It's not like we pay a premium for the brand or anything.

The wait for a rep would not have been so infuriating had not others, arriving without an appointment, been serviced first.  That defeats the whole purpose of making an appointment.  When I asked if I could get the first available rep because I had to get to work, the response was ""now that you have a 'hat', if I change it they'll get mad.""  So much for customer service.  

On a previous occasion, they couldn't even get my oil change done on the same day they had the car, so they had to pick me up in the shuttle and get me a loaner for the night.

Just horrible customer service.  I'm thinking it's worth the $50 or whatever to rent a car from another dealer to avoid this place. ",1.8

I recently purchased a bmw 2009 328 coupe and had a really good experience.  First, i just recently finished college been working for about 1 year, didn't have much credit history.  From the moment i first met her, she offered to sell me any car in the lot for invoice price, not a penny more.  that was ok, but my financing app got declined 3 times, but she got her financing manager at the dealership involved and got me approved on the 4th try.  I would normally think that they would charge me little more or raise the APR, but she didn't.  She still sold me the car for invoice price and for advertised APR of 1.9%.  I would assume all sales people would somewhat take advantage of the situation.  Another thing, my dumb friend spills soda in the mid console( thank god it dind't touch the idrive)but i wanted to get it cleaned from the inside, disassemble the mid console.  when i first called the service dep, some shady ass rep told me he'll charge over $600.  I called the fleet manager Grace Kim and explained my situation, and she freaked even harder than i did when i told her the estimate he gave me.  She told me to bring in the car the same day, took me to antoher service advisor and told him that i was her son's friend, so take good care of him.  He took a looke inside, moved somethings around and told me i don't really need to get it cleaned from inside, but if i wanted to, he'll charge $160.

When we found one we liked, the saleswoman said the dealership puts on sales and that the one we chose was one of two that the manager puts on the lot at a really incentive price. We had previously purchased a Honda which also was at a special price at  Scott Robinson Honda, so we were aware that the dealers do that, we were excited. When we went to put the downpayment on the car, we were told that they made an error on the price because the girl that types in the price made a mistake and that if we wanted ""that"" car we would have to pay an extra $5,000 more than what the sticker stated.  We told them isn't that a Bait and Switch tactic?  They said no and that if we wanted it, they could knock off a few hundred on it.  We couldn't believe it.  We were then told that the Director of Execellence would call us.  I spoke to him but he did nothing but said they could not sell the car because they made a mistake. We were so angry that  we then went to Scott Robinson and told them the story and they stated that happened to them once but they honered the price.  And they could prove it!

1144,"April 20, 2007","The battery light came on in my 2002 BMW which per the manual, meant that the alternator needed to be replaced.  I took it to South Bay BMW and they called me after inspecting the vehicle and said that it would cost $1100 to replace it.  I thought it was a little high, but opted to do it.  What really got me upset was that they said that the car needed all kinds of other repairs totaling over $4000.  In addition to the alternator, they recommended the following:  new power steering hoses, new water pump, thermostat, radiator, expansion tank, control arm and other miscellaneous work.  They even said that the tires had some wear on them and they were brand new!  Oh and get this, I recently had changed the battery and got a non-BMW battery since it was 1/2 the price.  They said that a non-BMW battery could even cause problems.  Come on, it's the same voltage whether it comes from a BMW battery or other brand.   

This is a BMW and is supposed to be built to last.  It's why I paid $45k for it.  If it needs $4000 worth of repairs for a 4-5 year old car, something is wrong.  The bottom line is that the car didn't need the extra repairs.  These guys are unethical and only looking to take advantage of their customers and maximize profits.  I'll never go back to them again.  I'm lucky that I knew enough not to do the unecessary work, but I feel sorry for the next customer that might believe them.  Stay away!",2.4

When they did finally agree to meet with me, 5 months to the date later, I was informed that since I filed with the BBB they could do nothing because it was now a legal matter.

He explained everything they checked and told me that I don't need to change the brake pads yet.However, a month later, I noticed some screeching noise when backing up the car. Called the dealer, they said it might be some dirt stuck in the pads. Since it was on and off, I thought they might be right. It became more frequent and I finally decided to call the dealership.. again. Turned out that I need to replace all 4 brake pads and rotors!! Could've told me that a month ago and saved my rotors, idiots! Not only that, when I picked up the car, it wasn't ready. Plus I had to wait for almost 1 hour just to find out they need to clean the car first. AARGH!! They said they didn't know I was there. What did they think I was doing in the waiting area?? D-OH! BTW, the svc. advisor's name was Jeff, and guess what. He wasn't even THERE to explain about the work being done. I had to READ my copy of bills (which I didn't pay, thanks to the warranty). Later on I noticed they lost one of my tire bolts. Sure made me feel safe driving it. However, they put a new one on as soon as I call them.Third time I brought it in was for oil service. As usual, they found some things need to be done, and what a coincidence, they're all not covered in the warranty! After an hour of discussion and inquiries, I finally agreed to the service. When I took my car (in a dark evening), they forgot to reset the oil change indicator. The next day I noticed that emblem on the hood was chipped and there's a new scratch on my door (driver side). Called them and I brought it in a couple days later. Jeff was really nice in getting me into a loaner, but I was quite annoyed when he said it must be from a rock. Well, the chip was really big and there was a scratch mark on the rest of the emblem. It must've been a HUGE rock and how come I didn't see/hear it?Finally, got a new emblem and the scratch fixed. Took it from the lot on a rainy day (DARN!) and the next day found a new scratch on my driver side window. I'm in a dilemma whether to bring it back and get it fixed but get a new problem, or just don't bring it back at all. I chose the latter.Good thing about this place: free loaners, friendly advisors (when you get a hold of them).Bad thing: poor quality of service (which I think is more important than nice customer service and a free loaner).All in all, I'll never bring it back there.
