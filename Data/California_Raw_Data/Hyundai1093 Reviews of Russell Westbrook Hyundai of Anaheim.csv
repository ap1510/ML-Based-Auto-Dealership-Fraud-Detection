0,"March 18, 2020","We purchased a used 2019 Toyota 4 Runner from them.  The car was advertised with key less entry.  I was given a valet key to test drive the vehicle.  We drove 70 miles to see the car.  We could not find a white one near us in Northern LA County.  We drove two hours to get there.  

We purchased the vehicle with CASH.  We asked for an alarm system and an extended warranty.  We were told the warranty would be accepted at any Hyundai dealership (we questioned that since we bought a Toyota).  

We paid for those items in the amount of $4,442.00.  CASH  After signing all the papers we were taken out to the car and handed the valet key.  I asked what about the key fobs that operate the key less entry and set the alarm.  The salesman said they didn't get those keys when they got the car.  The car had been on their lot for over 20 days.  

The day after the purchase we spent another $247.31.  We sent the bill to the dealership to pay us back.  They said that they didn't owe us that money just because they advertised key less entry, they never had those keys to give us, so they would not reimburse us for that.  

Within 3 days of purchasing the car, we tried to get the alarm system to work,.  It didn't.  We took it to a Toyota dealership close to our home and there is no alarm system and Toyota will not honor the extended warranty we paid for, neither would the Hyundai dealership down the street.  

I was sent a form to fill out to cancel the warranty, but the paperwork asked for a dealer number,  I was not being given that by Russell Westbrook dealership.  I found something that said it was a dealer number and filled out the form completely and signed it.  All the dealer had to do was sign and date it and send it to the warranty company and send me a copy of the completed form    I have been waiting for 7 days for them to sign and send it in to the warranty company and to me..  The 30 days to cancel the warranty and to make claims for the items we paid for but were never given is almost up and now they won't respond to my calls or emails.  

I feel that this dealership does a bait and switch scam and false advertising between the keys, the alarm and the warranty.   Then throw in we are in our golden years, and the whole deal hurts more.

Never trust a used car salesman is what this has taught us.  Sad that an NBA star has his name attached to such a horrible business.

1,"March 08, 2020","  Jonathan was an amazing salesman. He was patient, attentive, and answered all of our questions. I will refer my family and friends to your dealership and make sure they see Jonathan. It’s refreshing to Find a salesman that doesn’t pressure you and finds a way to make it work.",5.0
2,"November 30, 2019",Customer service was great. Sheen was our salesmen and helped us get into a 2019 Sonata limited. They took care of us through the whole car buying process. ,5.0
3,"August 03, 2019","I was looking for a 2019 Elantra Sport.  A couple of dealers close to me had it in stock but not the color I wanted, so I made the drive of over an hour to Russell Westbrook of Anaheim because they seemed like they were honest over the phone. Once I got there, things started off great and friendly....test drove the car..friendly chit chat..but how quickly things changed. After the test drive and the friendly conversation. 

The shady tactics immediately began. I repeatedly told the salesman over and over that I wanted everything clear and transparent as far as vehicle price and out the door price. What do they do? They play the monthly payment game with me. 

"" How much do you want your payment to be? "" 

I already knew this was a shady tactic. But I played along. A man's character is worth more to me than any dollar amount. So I let the salesman do his thing. We do the back and fourth as he goes to his manager. Comes back. Goes to his manager. Comes back. This happens about 5 times. He comes back the 5th time and there is "" service agreement "" now worked into the pricing. So I asked him what is it ? He told me it was an extended warranty. I told him Hyundai has the best warranty in the Auto industry and I didn't want it. He responds with :

""I can't get your payment to where you want it if you don't get the warranty and help me out. "" 

( Basically make his commission higher. )

I chuckle to myself inside and let him do his thing. They basically were playing the let's make the customer tired game and they will cave. This dealership is ridiculous.  Mind you I have bought many many cars over the years and personally I work in sales myself. So this was fun for me to observe. 

We finally get to a payment that works for me and mind you, I still haven't seen what the total price is on the car and anything else that's added on top of the vehicle. At this point we have been at the dealer about 4 hours now. I see the camera in the corner of the ceiling so I know they are watching me from the almighty mirrored managers office. Give me a break.

I actually don't see the final numbers until it's just about closing and I'm in the finance managers office.  

In the final contract there was a KARR alarm system I wasn't told about that was over 1300 dollars. A 3M clear sticker that was 595. The "" Warranty "" at over 1400 dollars. Mind you, all of the additions caused my payment to be 60 dollars more a month than it needed to be. That's worth it to me to see a dealer and a man's true colors.  

I told them I didn't want any of it, they told me they couldn't do the deal if they took all of the above items off...I know right?! The shady keeps coming. LOL. They said the alarm was pre installed and they couldn't uninstall it. Wow. Having bought cars before I already knew they could just disable it if they wanted too. But they didn't, instead they assumed I was dumb and wouldn't put up much of a fight. I didn't. Not because I'm dumb, but rather I wanted to see how desperate this dealer was to make a profit, I wanted to see how far this dealer would take things. I walked out of there feeling like if I was anyone else. They wouldn't have known better.

I would have told everyone I knew to come buy their new Hyundai here...unfortunately I won't. 

What is the lesson here folks? An honest sale keeps more sales coming. A pipeline and book of business that is consistently lasting. This dealer won't have that. Not with my salesman anyways. 

This is the exact reason I left sales. I wonder how the salesman would feel if his or her child walked into buy a car and this happened to them? 

All of you are probably asking....

"" You did end up buying the car. So what's up with this review ? ""

Well simple answer is, consider myself collateral damage. I experienced it, so now being informed. You know what to expect when you walk into this place. Call it, community service if you will.

4,"July 17, 2019","I absolutely agree with the previous post.  After getting a quote from another dealership yesterday and two trips there, the other dealership added on $4k to my final price.  I contacted Anaheim and told them exactly what happened and specified I just wanted up front pricing, total out the door.   I wasted an entire day going back and forth only to have them add on almost $6k more than what we started with.  Apparently this is standard practice for Hyundai???",1.0
5,"July 08, 2019","Fraudsters. They agree on a price then get you to come in and raise the price. 

Its illegal and they should be shut down.

An embarrassment to Hyundai.

As listed on other reviews, they add useless things to the car without telling you, to raise the price, even if you ask them for all the details about how they go to the total before you go in.

16,"May 04, 2019","It has taken 4 separate attempts to satisfy a dashboard display electrical problem plus many days that required my Genesis to remain at the dealership. Each time I was told the problem was fixed.  It was NOT. The last time, before I picked up the car, I asked Mario to personally make a visual inspection and verify the fix. He said it was fixed and the car was ready for pick up.  I picked up the car and immediately noted the display was NOT fixed.  They replaced the entire dashboard cluster and didn't check to see if it worked.  Incredible incompetence.  I GOT AN EMAIL SAYING SOMEONE IN SERVICE WOULD REACH OUT TO ME (AFTER A BAD REVIEW). Not a word.  Hyundai of America was involved with two case numbers and also failed to solve anything. I love the car but will never buy another Hyundai (I have a Genesis and an Elantra presently). I'm going to try Tustin Hyundai for future service.  I doubt if my dashboard problem will ever be fixed.

32,"November 18, 2018","Frank Yu was easy to work with and made my car buying experience simple and easy. He didn’t sell me anything more than what I wanted for my Hyundai Kona. I did all my research online and he gave me the best value for what I was looking for.

When I went to pick up the car, it was Frank’s day off, but Ken Beardsley was available to assist. The process was relatively simple since everything was already agreed upon before coming to the dealership. However, I still had to wait about 3.5 hours to sign paperwork with the Finance Manager and drive the car off the lot.

I arrived on a very windy, dirty Thursday morning and I told Oscar that I would not be buying today, but I was very interested in testing and learning about the Tuscon, Hyundai.  My lease of another make was up and I was just kinda window shopping.  He was very courteous and respectful of what I was saying.  He never once pressured me into buying, but was very informative.  He was the one that actually sold me on the Tuscon without any pressure what so ever.  Can't give him enough praise of what a great guy he is and I diffinately will be giving his name out.  I did not buy that day, but the next day I drove off the lot with a new Tuscon thanks to Oscar.",5.0
34,"November 12, 2018","We recently bought 2018 Elantra from Frank Yu and our experience was excellent.  What a nice guy!  

We were coming to an end on a lease (Toyota) and needed a car that my wife can use until next summer before handing over the keys to our son.  So initially we looked at some used cars and CPOs then realize, not much more we can pickup a nice 2018 Elantra.  We did check out other brands such as Toyota, Mazada & VW before deciding on Hyundai.

We did the normal online search for prices/inventory and pretty much decided on the exact color & trim before hitting the dealers for test drive & in-person inspections.  So by the time we came in to see Frank in person, we had already picked the exact car & agreed on the price.

So, needless to say, the process was pretty straight forward.

We would highly recommend Frank in that he nice, flexible and honest during the whole process.  What else can you ask for in a car sales person?",5.0

So I came  to Russell Westbrook based on dealer rating and the car price I saw on the exact car I wanted. When I arrived, Frank had my future car waiting for me to test drive. Frank showed me all of the features of the car and was easy to work with. Everyone here was great. No surprises or high pressure tactics of any kind. I’m happy with the experience and the car. Highly recommend! ",5.0
36,"November 10, 2018","Oscar Canterero met us on the lot when we were first considering a Hyundai Santa Fe. He was professional, accommodating, relatable, friendly, honest, polite, and extremely respectful of our thoughts and concerns. We connected with him right away with his ""put-us-at-ease"" manner. We found a car we wanted to buy but we weren't quite ready so we said we'd be in the next day but it was his day off. He came in anyway for the afternoon and found us an even newer car that we ended up purchasing. Oscar allowed us ""alone time"" to discuss this purchase, he was able to interject things to consider, and he always asked our permission to give his opinion. He didn't make us feel like he was hovering but he was still there to answer our questions and concerns. We got to know him through sharing about our children and his children therefore we felt like we have a new friend. He worked with us during the signing process, took time to explain the features of the car after our purchase, and he got excited for us and with us. Then he introduced us to Neda who was totally professional and pleasant to work with as we went through the signing process. She made that process so much easier and very thorough. Her demeanor instilled confidence in that part of our purchase. It was a long day for us but for Oscar and Neda also. We feel like if we had any questions even at this point either of those individual would be happy to answer our questions. Our purchase of this vehicle has given us ""pride of ownership"" not only because the car is so beautiful and solid but because of the solid relationships we made during it's purchase. We would absolutely recommend Westbrook Hyundai AND Oscar Canterero to assist our friends or family. ",5.0

39,"November 01, 2018","** Buyer beware ** My wife and I were confronted and yelled at by Fred Angiuli, Hyundai Finance & Sales Manager, during final car purchase negotiations **

This is the most unprofessional car dealership I have experienced.  In summary, Fred Angiuli, Sales Manager, yelled at my wife and I for trying to get a good deal. 

My wife and I obtained a price quote via e-mail and agreed to meet w/ the internet sales lead.  We met w/ on a Tuesday afternoon on 10/30 around 6:30 PM (The day before Halloween).  Fast forward to 8:30PM; after 2 hours of test driving the car, negotiating sales price, and looking at financing, my wife and I agreed upon a number w/ the internet lead.  We were ready to make the sale.

The internet lead calls us into the main office and we're greeted by Fred Angiuli, sales manager.  Fred Angiuli, Sales Manager, proceeds to question why we are paying such a low price for the car, states my wife and I do not understanding the terms of purchase (as we initially had a price quote via e-mail), and proceeds to upcharge the final price by an additional amount.  

My wife requests to waive the upcharge.  

Fred, Sales Manager, is furious we are requesting for a discount.  He retorts, ""You know the price you're paying, you're not getting this discount.  Don't play your pregnant card too.  Drop that act.""  After this comment, Fred proceeds to and yell at my wife and I in front of his entire team.

Fred, Sales Manager, proceeds to explain why we are not entitled to a discount.  Looking at my home address and the location of this dealership, Fred feels we've traveled ""far"" coming to his dealership.  Furthermore, it's close to month-end, it's the day before Halloween, and it's almost closing time.  He retorts, ""Your timing is perfect and don't act like you don't know you're getting a good deal.  Stop playing the dumb card.""

My wife is puzzled why Fred is so angry and then asks for his name to try to ask him questions.  Fred retorts in a condescending way, ""I'm Fred.  This [associate] is [name], this [associate] is  [name], this [associate] is [name], this [associate] is [name].""  He says the names of all of his staff in the same room as us (keep in mind they are not involved in this conversation, just looking at us).  And adds, ""any other questions you have?  So can we make the sale?""

Fred is still furious we're asking for a discount.  Fred then adds a backhand comment, ""I've given you this great price.  And during this entire conversation you haven't even thanked me.  Where is my thank you?""

My wife and I then proceed to refuse the purchase.  We then say we feel we're being attacked by Fred and being talked down by him.  He says, ""You only say I'm talking down to you because of the price.  If the price was now the initial agreed upon, then you'd say I am a nice guy.""  More on this later.

He apologizes but in a very condescending and non-authentic way (Note - he doesn't keep eye contact during this apology, but during his entire confrontation, he keeps eye contact).  My wife then says she would've preferred some transparency in terms of the price instead of upcharging us at the last minute.  In essence, we've wasted 2 hours and did not eat dinner.  

Fred retorts back, ""Stop playing the [pregnancy] card already.  If food is the issue then we'll pick something up for you!!!""  We left the dealership in disgust.

-- I respect a business defending it's price, but Fred's could've said things MUCH differently.  I work in customer service and there is no reason to belittle and attack a client, especially in front of the a team.  Furthermore, if Fred was angry at the price agreed upon he should have had this conversation with his employees.  This conversation should not have been made w/ the client (at least not so aggressively).
-- In retrospect, as a client, of course we are coming to this dealership because we found competitive pricing!  Otherwise we wouldn't have come here at all!  I mean, as a customer, of course we are trying to get a good deal! 
-- Fred's final comment, summarized, ""If the price is right, then I wouldn't be a mean guy.  I'd be a nice guy.""  This is completely untrue.  I would NOT make the purchase because of Fred's hostile attitude.  Once he started to attack us I did not feel comfortable making the purchase (Regardless of the price).  My trust in him and the dealership was thrown out the window.  

TIPS:
-Buyer beware for sales manager Fred Angiuli.  Very aggressive, confrontational, and may verbally attack you during final negotiations which is what happened during our experience.",1.8

57,"July 27, 2018","Horrible customer service all across the board, from the staff to the management.  Unfortunately I am not able to give less than 1 star.

I put a deposit on a car that I was told would be in stock on July 17.  A couple weeks away from the arrival date, I began following up to make sure its arrival was still on schedule.  After a week of no follow up, I started to worry something was wrong.  I eventually found out from Hyundai corporate, not the dealership, that the car I put a deposit on was sold on July 2.  I then spent the next week trying to get a hold of someone at the dealership to get an explanation and try to work on a solution.  I had troubles getting a hold of anyone, and when I did, I didn't get any answers or solutions, and on one occasion I had an employee flat-out hang up on me.

Eventually, it was clear to me that nobody was going to help me, so I ended up buying a car elsewhere.  The day after I bought a car I finally got a call back from Ahmad, with whom I spoke on Tuesday, with no follow up.  He told me that he did call me back on Tuesday, but I never received a phone call from him nor did he leave a voice mail.  Even after I told him this, he would not relent and was adamant that he did call, despite evidence to the contrary.  This dealership made a mistake, but made absolutely no effort to correct it; instead, I had an extremely difficult time getting a hold of anybody, never got any answers when I did talk to anyone, was hung up on, and called a liar by a manager.

During our negotiations on a lease, Mr.Davila promised me a rebate on the difference for charges capitalized as NO TAX FEES and my eventual DMV costs.

Upon receiving my plates and registration fees of $575 from the DMV, and speaking with Mr. Davila on April 4, 2018, Mr. Davila acted like he didn't even know me and denied making any such representations or promises to me.  

I've followed up with numerous attempts to speak with the dealership General Manager, Danielle Ortega, and I left several messages for her to call.  She has not.

After purchasing four new cars from this dealership, you would think I'd be considered a valued customer and treated with respect.   Not.

My next communications will be with dealership ownership and the corporate Hyundai office.

100,"March 27, 2018","This location is about one thing and one thing only; making their quick buck. 

I bought my Elantra back in 2012 and have had no issues with it in the past ever which is great, for the brand, but this location has turned me off from getting a new vehicle from them and I will explain why. 

Over the years I found that I will no longer be wanting to buy vehicles as I grow tired of them quickly. I have decided to sell my current car and lease a new vehicle; I was predominantly looking at Lexus but would have looked at some vehicles from Hyundai and other like makers. 

It was like the company was reading my mind, because they called me and asked if I wanted to go in and see what they could give me for my current car as I was regularly servicing with them and had low miles for the year. 

After setting up the appointment with them the relations got sour. They called like 4 times to confirm I was coming and immediately while on the phone tried to get me to pick out cars to see and buy/lease and did not give much thought to my current car situation--But I still decided to go to the meeting, but first decided to spend about 100 dollars getting the vehicle detailed so it looked nice for them. This meeting was solely to sell my current vehicle or get numbers and continue my research, but by the response I feel they had only one thought in mind; sell, sell, sell.

I arrived early and was told by the gentleman out front that mister Babazadeh (the person to contact me) was on a test drive would be back shortly. I waited... I waited... and I waited. The person who originally brought me in came back three times to check on me and see if Babazadeh had come by yet and nothing. I had waited beyond our reservation for him and nothing. I was annoyed to say the least. This man and his team contacted me four times within two days to make this meeting happen and then would not come out to see me. 

I decided to remove myself from the company completely as I felt beyond disrespected and told them to remove me from all forms of communication and that I would be taking my business elsewhere. I told him who I was suppose to meet with and what the situation was; which he then stated that he was just in the office right behind me and could get him for me.

Sooo he was here and just decided not to come out to see me?? Obviously I opted out of seeing him and I truly am offended by the way they handled the situation. My schedule is chaotic and I blocked out an entire evening for him and he did not acknowledge me the entire time I was on the facility.

128,"February 21, 2018","Service Department is a disorganized operation from minute you walk through the door. Let begin by saying that My past experience with this dealership was very positive and as a matter of fact I recommended it to a number of my friends.I noticed once I arrived the Dealership was under a new Ownership no big issue there.... that is until i sat there waiting for someone to attend to my vehicle. 

After about 10 minutes I walked inside where I again waited for one of the Service personnel to speak to me...finally after another 10 minutes I caught the attention of one and he proceeded to figure out that I was there for my scheduled service but alas he could not help me apparently because I had a Genesis and I had to be handled by a concierge service person...OMG what a train wreck that turned out to be, I got handed off after another 10-15 minutes to Erica, who proceeded to tell me it would not be more than 30 minutes. After two hours had passed Erica reappeared only to tell me they were almost done and all that had to be done was to wash my car and I could be on my way. 

It was annoying enough to have gone through the gauntlet of trying to find a service person and being ignored, but then I figured look they must have just changed management with the new Ownership it cant get any worse.....Well, Not sure where Erica was trained but someone forgot to teach her how to follow-up because there I sat for another Two hours waiting for my car (to be washed). What a waste of a half of a day, I am a pretty reasonable person and I am willing to give some latitude with New Ownership change but come on now Westbook Hyundai get your act together. You want the Genesis to compete with the High-end cars in the Market, well guess what you have a long way to go, train your staff, teach them the fine art of follow-up and customer service, until then I am avoiding your operation until you get your act together. Next time I buy a car I will pay closer attention to the service department, if its run like this one... Run for the Hills!

132,"February 18, 2018","Quick overview of my recent purchase experience at Russell Estbrook Hyundai in Anaheim

Initial visit was on a Tuesday night - chose dealer as close to work and figured at worst I could test drive and do my research. Ken (jhang) Lee approached me after I was on-site and offered his assistance. I was looking at three vehicles - Sonata, Tucson, Santa Fe Sport. We spent the better part of 90 minutes discussing pro’s / con’s of each vehicle, test driving multiple models (engine variations) so I could start my decision. Ken was polite, engaging, informative and non-pressure the entire time.

Came back Thursday evening as I was now set on a Hyundai and simply struggling between the Santa Fe and Sonato (preferred the drive feel, power and options). Test drive both vehicles again and for a longer time. Ken answered more questions and we set a time on Sat to look at a purchase. Still no pressure or crazy sales tactics

Sat went very well - only issue was the high volume of sales so everything was delayed (holiday weekend and big sales so not dealership issue - if time is critical go on a weeknight otherwise you may have a wait). 

I went in with my window sticker pulled from their website with all pricing, rebates and discounts clearly listed. I knew what I did and didn’t want from dealer add-on’s So within 45 minutes the sales portion was done with an agreed to price (Tip: do your homework, make your decisions and stick to them). Dealership minimized upsell tactics (stand your ground if no add-on’s) and was very easy to deal with.

Financing went fine (rates are reasonable but a local credit union might be less expensive) although delayed here with the backlog as well. Be sure to review all paperwork as one error which they corrected with no fuss. No unpleasant up-selling (know ahead of time what you and don’t want. Mike was a pleasure to deal with.

Excellent experience - do your research. Run your numbers and you should have a greacopy experience.

At the end of the day I bought the car I wanted at a very fair price - dealer discount and awesome Hyundai rebates saved me a little over $4,000 off MSRP. (Better deal than the Hyundai friends and family deal I worked out with a friend employed by Hyundai)

Highly recommend Ken Lee and Russel Westbrook Hyundai!",5.0

Kai Divina was the absolute best, I told him what I was looking for and he was able to instantly show me two or three options that were perfect for me. Kai helped work with my budget, something that not many other dealerships were willing to do, and I was able to get the car I had initially wanted at an AWESOME PRICE!! I am beyond happy with my new car and Kai made sure the process went as smooth as possible. He really cares about the customers needs and expectations.

143,"February 08, 2018","Oh my gosh, where do I begin? First, our car salesman, Q ( Yes, he goes by one letter) is a warm, friendly and accommodating gentleman. He didn't approach us like a typical salesman. If he did, I would have decided to leave right away. Because he behaved in a manner like he can be anyone's uncle, father my husband and I sticked around. He was patient and willing to work with us regarding our finance. He worked hard for us to get the car that we want and the price: Hyundai Sonata Limited. 
Secondly, we had the pleasure of working with Kenny Kessler from the Finance Department.  He was so easy going, positive, and professional. He was very thorough on what we signed and he made us feel genuine, appreciative customers. 

One of the most important character of any person is integrity.  I witnessed this attribute with Q and Kenny.  They consistently kept their words and promises from discussing the cost of our vehicle to executing our contract.  I was truly impressed with this morale.  

Lastly, Q and Kenny didn't make us feel like a number nor a ""just another customer to get a commission.""   I will HIGHLY RECOMMEND ALL OUR FRIENDS, FAMILY, COLLEAGUES,  STUDENTS, AND CLIENT'S.  Thank you the fantastic experience of purchasing a Hyundai Sonata Limited 😊😊😊  ",5.0

They make sure to walk you through the entire process explaining the cost, payment breakdown, and even making sure you fully understand the in’s and outs of operating your car so you feel comfortable driving off.  Frank Yu not only helped me locate the vehicle I wanted, but made sure it was ready at the dealership by the time I arrived cleaned and gased up! The whole process took about an hour from the moment I arrived to the moment I drove off in my new Elantra GT (including the time to turn in my current lease). I really appreciate how transparent he was about costs upfront so there were no surprises. He explained each step as we went along to help manage my expectations on how long it would take to complete everything, and even helped me connect my phone via blue tooth as he gave me a quick tutorial to get me acclimated with the car. 

Even the finally paperwork was super easy. Kenny was very patient and gave me plenty of time to review the terms and conditions of my contract and was happy to answer my questions. Ahmad and the team were very helpful and genuine. I’ll definitely be referring my friends and family back to RW Hyundai in the future. Thanks so much!

I filled out the application for the test drive gift card ($40 Amazon GC) that was presented as a pop-up ad on your dealer website and printed it out (voucher code #29500-1998).  I brought the form in for a test drive on 11/3/17 with Curtis Payne and handed it to the receptionist after the test drive.

All of the listings I had printed out from the website, and verified by VIN number on the phone, were incorrect -- at least in terms of color. Not a single one matched. The salesperson didn't know what he had available. We found one on the lot I liked, and he attempted to find out whether it was already sold, but never did. He said he would check into possible equity in my returned lease because of very low mileage and good condition; he never did.  There were several mix ups during negotiations that I will mostly attribute to the fact that these occurred late in the evening after I'm sure an already long day -- we were there well after closing. The Finance Mgr. made a few errors that caused me some grief; there was a mixup about the payments for my returned lease that didn't get resolved.  I received what I believe to be a decent deal on the lease, but I would never take it for service there. My guys at RW Hyundai in Garden Grove had it more together for my first lease.",2.6

He took me to the storage lot to test drive a few different cars, and just when I thought I was done and going to be getting my car and going home, there it was! A Sonata Sport in the most beautiful Nouveau Blue I've ever seen. It was love at first sight. I prayed the interior color met my needs, and as I got closer my heart began to race with excitement... It did! I immediately asked to take her out for a spin.    Now came the hard decision, do I or don't I? I admit I took a LOT of time making up my mind, but I never once felt pushed.

I was currently under contract with another loan, so I knew it wouldn't be the easiest deal. Q took a test cruise with me, then we sat down and talked details. Once we had a number established, it was up to me to give the OK. My finance agent was Lisa. She was extremely helpful and friendly.

I felt pressured to agree to a warranty service that was 10yr/60,000 miles. The finance representative stated it's a must have to get finance approved. I was under the impression that additional warranty was optional not mandatory. Warranty services were not clearly explained. Finance representative was rushing us to sign contract and was not very detailed with services and warranty.

402,"February 26, 2017","Unfortunately there is no ""zero"" star.

I should have followed my guts and read the reviews carefully before getting stuck and buying my Hyundai from Hardin.
I have no issues with the car, but my issue is Hardin. As soon as they sell the car, forget about anything else including customer service and satisfaction.

I will state my story as short as possible:
I took the car for a test drive it had the ""alarm"" light on and the front right wheel was inflated at 22 psi (normal is 34 psi). I told the sales guy (Mark) and he said it is ok, just drive it, the car might have this alarm because it was parked for some time.""
We had a deal and I bought the ""Certified Per-owned Hyundai"" from Hardin. Next day I went to receive it, and asked the sales guy to make sure the Tyre pressure is checked. After driving the car for 2 days the alarm went on again highlighting that the same wheel is inflated; I went to a gas station to add air and decided to buy a Tyre pressure gauge to check it next time. After another 2 days the same thing happened, then I took action and called the sales guy (Mark) who advised me to go to the service center and tell them the issue and they will fix it.
I visited the service center, and explained the issue and story to a guy named Richard, who took the car and said they will check it. After 30 minutes he tells me there is a nail in the Tyre and the tyre needs replacement. I asked him to talk to the sales guy and fix the issue. He replies, ""you have to call your sales guy and you ask him to send us a due bill to fix this!"" I calmly called Mark who said this is not my call or in my hands and he cannot do anything except talk to his manager.

At that point I sensed the unprofessional system of Hardin and asked Richard to give me the car. I went to a tyre shop and they immediately fixed it for $20 dollars. Meanwhile, I received a call from Mark who bluntly advised that his manager said that ""the car is certified and their guys have checked the car before I took it and it had no issues."" I reminded him that there was an alarm when I had the test drive, he acknowledged it and said he remembers it, but it is not his call."" At that point I said ""Thank You Mark,"" and closed the phone.

Thank God I did not buy a service contract with them, now I am carefully checking the market to check the best authorized service center/dealer who can take care of my car for a long term maintenance relation. Gladly it will not be Hardin Hyundai.

Bottom line is lack of internal coordination, poor customer service, and lack of responsibility. The attitude is ""you have the car now, just deal with it and stop bugging us, there is nothing we can do.""

Trust me guys, if you want to buy a Hyundai just buy it from any trusted authorized dealer.",1.0

Although there are various other places to receive oil changes/maintenance checks/etc., I am very selective about the treatment of my vehicle. For this very reason, Hardin Hyundai is the only place I have elected to take my car for nearly 10 years. When I decided to part with my first Hyundai, there was no question in my mind that I would stick with the Hyundai brand. After locating a Hyundai Veloster on the Hardin Hyundai website and calling to inquire about the car, Chris L. helped address all my initial needs. Once I came into the dealership, my salesman, Fred M., graciously greeted me and listened to all of the requirements I needed met in order to make my second purchase. Not only was Fred professional and extremely knowledgeable throughout the entire demonstration, but his kind and honest demeanor was ultimately why I elected to buy the car. I could not be more pleased with the attention I was paid during my purchase and for this very reason I have remained one of Hardin Hyundai's most loyal and satisfied customers for the past decade.",5.0

We had such a bad experience with Jay Prieto and when the sales person your working with commits to a price OTD on a piece of paper and then backs away from it and then makes you believe that the car is in the lot but is not, and then you find out it's in the OFF SITE lot.  Enough said, it just got worse from there.

Sometimes when a business has to over advertise that they are #1 dealership in the west coast, they don't tend to have elevated sales associates.  You get cocky and tend to get away with a lot of things, even if it means being dishonest and manipulating the customer and giving them false hope.

NEVER AGAIN!!!  Truly disappointed at this location and will gladly go to another location not to deal with salespeople like Jay Prieto.",1.0

549,"October 07, 2016","This dealership utilizes extremely deceptive business practices. If you have your heart set on a specific vehicle, this is not the place for you. I'm sure they are fully capable of selling you a car if you either have no clue what you want or maybe have a general idea without specifics, but that was not my experience. 

I live all the way down in east county San Diego (a good two hours away with no traffic), but was thrilled when I found a green Fiat 500 with the trim and features I had been looking for. It was *the* car at a fantastic price. I called up the dealership to confirm they still had it in stock and spoke with Victor. He sounded confused about which car I was looking for, even though I provided him with the stock number and year/make/model/color. It sounded like he just wanted to get me off the phone because he kept cutting me off when I was trying to clarify with him that he has two Fiats on his lot and I am specifically looking for the green one. Rather than look it up in his system, he hurriedly told me he'd ""have one of [his] guys drive around the lot looking for it"" and he'd call me back in 10 minutes. Uh, okay. 

Nearly an hour later, he calls back excitedly saying the white Fiat was still available and the grey one was being detailed right now. I asked him if the green one had sold then, and he said he knew nothing about a green one. We clearly have a listening issue here because I must have said the word ""green"" nearly 10 times during our previous phone conversation. I clarified that he did in fact say ""grey"" when referring to the car being detailed, and he said he would double check on it and call me back because now he's not sure. Four hours later, I still hadn't heard from him so I texted him with the VIN and stock number, once again reminding him that I wanted the green Fiat. A couple hours later, he responds that is is still available. I guess there was some kind of misunderstanding in green vs. grey color? I still don't know. So, taking his word for it, I took time off work and finalized all my financing the next day (Wednesday) after making an appointment with him to see the car on Friday at 5pm.

I get a call on Friday morning (today) asking if I am still interested in seeing the Fiat today. Yes, absolutely! He once again asks which color I wanted. (Can I really expect otherwise at this point?) I tell him, once again, that I am interested in the green Fiat. Without skipping a beat, he tells me it already sold. I asked him when it happened, and he said, ""I don't know. It could have been last night. It's just not showing up in my system as being in stock. It's not here."" Oh, so there IS a system now? We didn't need to play the game of send-the-sales-guy-around-the-lot-and-make-up-colors? He obviously really wants to sell the white one because he mentions, again, that they have a white one I could come take a look at. The grey car has apparently completely disappeared at this point. I told him, again, I live two hours away and that there are plenty of white Fiats here should I decide to select a different color. The only reason I was willing to drive up to Anaheim was to get this specific car. ""Oh,"" he says, ""you should have put a deposit on it then.""

WHAT? I'm sorry, but what? Why was I not informed of this during the several conversations I had with him? Our first contact was Tuesday, at which point I told him I couldn't even make it up there until Friday. Why not tell me on Tuesday that the car may sell in between now and then, so I should probably put a deposit on it if I was really interested? We spoke again on Wednesday and again confirmed the Friday appointment; why not mention it then? I would put money on the fact that it wasn't there even the first time we spoke. Needing to send someone into the lot to look, confusing grey and green, constantly bringing up the white Fiat... yeah, that green Fiat probably hadn't been there this whole week. It didn't just sell last night. He said he'd double check to make sure the green one sold and call me back. Regardless of what he says, I won't believe him. I'm not going to drive all the way up there only to be once again pitched the same white Fiat I can buy 10 miles from my house. 

You always hear about people calling car salesmen xxxxxxxx, but I like to give people the benefit of the doubt. Hardin Hyundai unfortunately proved the stereotype to be true - they will go to any lengths to get you to purchase a car on their lot, including lying to you just to get you to come in. I've learned my lesson, just like another reviewer who was put in the same position did (only she actually showed up to the dealership). Don't even try this dealership unless you live or work right around the corner. Don't spend any significant amount of time driving in to the dealership, because in all likelihood, the car you have your heart set on is gone, despite what they tell you. Whatever they say, they are probably lying.",1.0

588,"August 21, 2016","Was interested in buying a Genesis from Hardin Hyundai and saw a 2015 still on the lot - but priced such that once out the door, KBB (which we all use to guide the value of our cars) dictated that the same car would be worth 10K less than Hardin Hyundai's asking price. I understand some depreciation but it seemed excessive to me. When I asked about this, I was told that the same KBB (which Hardin uses to value their trade-in's) - was only a guide and not to be trusted...also I was told that basically, if I didn't buy it, someone else would so - my business didn't really matter (the latter was my takeaway but not actually stated). The conversation basically ended after my sales rep told me if was ""a free country and he didn't HAVE to sell to me"". No explanation for the price gouge, just intimidation efforts it seems. Wouldn't go back and wouldn't encourage anyone to either. Bad attitude, bad service, bad prices.",1.0

609,"August 02, 2016","My experience with Frank Yu at Hardin Hyundai was so poor that I regret buying this car, and ever considering Hyundai. I will be happy to share my experience with anyone and everyone through any media outlets nesessary until the issue is resolved. Along side MANY other issues I had with him, the biggest is that I told him several times that he did not have my permission to run a hard inquiry on my credit and he sat there right in front of me and did it anyways! I have been working on my credit for YEARS so that I can buy a home, I had no need to buy this car, and told him I did not want the car if it meant I needed a hard inquiry, that was when he assured me he was only running a soft inquiry. I came in with a loan and a check already, why he would run a hard inquiry when a soft inquiry  would suffice, I had no intention of financing though Hardin!  After Frank emailed me and asked me to give him a score of 10 on this survey, I confronted him on the issue. Again, he ignored the issue and asked me to give him a 10 on the survey. When I tried to explain to him the severity of what he had done, he told me homeland security requested it and that his boss made him do it.  I am very upset and EXPECT that Hardin will work with me to resolve the issue.    I hope that one arrogant employee does not taint my impression of Hyundai more than he already has, and I do expect that this issue is resolved.",1.0

Mark in Finance was also very friendly and easy to speak with! In doing so, they also displayed a high level of professionalism without being intimidating.

He's very caring and really wants the best for you. If I ever need a vehicle or know someone that does, I'm definitely recommending Rene Ortega. From driving a 1998 Honda Civic DX to a 2017 Hyundai Electra. I must say it major step up. I feel very comfortable in it. It drives very similar and thats what I like. It didn't feel awkward like how other car did. It's very spacious and comfy. The model I got has adjustable center arm rest which helps with smaller petite people like myself. The seat are heated and very supportive. I love how I have rear view camera and blind spot indicators, when changing lanes. Full touch screen for music, Apple play, Pandora, SiriusXM and Maps.

Q was as frustrated as we were.  We left messages for the General Manager which were never returned.  Eventually, we had to find a similar car ourselves and convince Hardin to swap the cars as we had no confidence in the ability of Hardin to fix our new car and ensure it was safe.  They did so only with great reluctance.  The management team turned a great experience into a horrible one.

Stepping out of the box, collecting himself and visualizing the prize, he confidently re-enter and crouches close the the plate, sprung like a over wound watch.  The pitcher winds up and delivers Chris the pitch he wants....crack, boom, bang and the ball careens into history.  A Grand Slam, for the young man, from Anaheim!  As nice and visually poetic the above is, Chris McGregor did the seemingly impossible for us.  We wanted a AWD 2016 Tucson, in a specific color, package and interior trim. I had four local Hyundai Dealers working on this, none had it in stock.  Your determined Chris was the only one who found just what was specified.  He did it in a day, the deal was made and deposited over the phone and the Tucson began its journey to us from Tracy California....over 350 mile away. A few days later and the smaller scaled SUV now lives happily in our garage.This happened exclusively because of Chris and his ""drive"" to put his customers needs, wants and desires FIRST!  Upon entering the Dealership, to pick up our SUV, we were struck by its contemporary architectural style only to find a cozy and well planned environment inside.The staff could not have been more welcoming and accommodating. The actual ""buying of the car"" process was the smoothest and fastest I have ever had.  Quick, professional, zero pressure for the ""add-on"" (but mentioned), a through car tour and in-depth learning session about the SUVs systems, audio, navigation and phone paring.

871,"December 08, 2015","I come to Hardin for cars and appointments, and they are incredible with both. Second time leasing a car here, will be back for a third in a few years!",5.0
872,"December 08, 2015","See below for an email I recently wrote (11/30/15) directly to the dealership. I received a response from one Danielle Ortega, who simply asked for my name and gave no further communication since. 

""Before I write a negative review on the website, I figured I'd try emailing you directly to express my frustration. I purchased a 2013 Hyundai Sonata from your dealership a couple years ago and have been happy with the car. However, in order to keep the warranty agreement in place, I have been forced to commute from LA to your location to get my car serviced (as I have been told by several employees that I must go to your Hyundai location and none others).

I first want to acknowledge a number of positive aspects of my experiences with your dealership. First of all, while waiting for my car to be serviced on several occasions, I thoroughly appreciate the service of having an employee drive me to a local restaurant to grab a bite to eat or to the movies to entertain myself while I wait. Furthermore, the employees themselves have, for the large majority of the time, been a pleasure to deal with. The employees are very kind and generally enthusiastic. At the end of the day - the personnel is not my issue with this dealership. Rather, it is the quality of service, or lackthereof.

At this point, I've had around 4 or 5 services done. On only ONE occasion have I been completely satisfied. One issue I have had is timing - two of the services I have gotten (including my most recent on Nov 21st) I had scheduled appointments, and BOTH times my car was delivered back to my well passed the promised time. The first time was not a huge issue for me as I had no other commitments that day. However, for my last service, I called ahead of time to schedule my appointment, initially scheduled for 1:00pm. I asked the woman who was helping me schedule my appointment how long it will take for the particular service I was getting. She told me 2-2.5 hours. I then asked, what is the LONGEST it will take as I had a commitment to get to that evening. She proceeded to put me on hold and verify with another employee, who told her 3 hours was the maximum. To be safe, I scheduled changed my appointment time to 12:00 to be sure that, if the appointment took the 3 hours, I would s!
 till be
able to keep my commitment that evening.

I arrived for my appointment promptly at noon. My vehicle was not ready until around 3:50pm - almost 4 hours. Not only did it take almost an hour longer than I was promised, but they didn't even complete the service. When the gentlemen who initially greeted my at the vehicle drop off, he began taking down information of my vehicle and inspecting. He addressed the biggest concern were my tires, specifically my front tires. He attempted to get me to buy 4 new tires, which I declined because I could not afford them at the moment. However, I adamantly asked if my tires would be rotated during the service (as this was my vehicles first major service, from what I understand). The gentleman assured me they would. Of course, I noticed the other day that my tires had NOT been rotated. This is where my deepest frustration stems. Considering the length of time it took to service my car, EVEN WITH AN APPOINTMENT,  I kindly asked the gentleman to please give me a nice discount for my tro!
 ubles
(my previously mentioned commitment was at 5:00pm for which I ended up being hurried, and ultimately late to the function), to which he gave me a measly 10% for what appeared to be a AAA discount. Even after the discount, this costed me around $350. Considering the GREATEST CONCERN in the eyes of your technician - my tires - was NOT addressed by rotating my tires, how do I know if you performed and/or completed ANY service to my car at all?

As a customer, I should not be obligated to double check your work. It is astounding to me how much work seems half assed when it comes to services. For example, for at least two of my services, whoever was working on my car forgot to put one of the caps back on the air valve of one of my tires. When I was initially greeted this time around, I specifically mentioned to the gentleman that whoever serviced my car previously forgot to put one of these caps back on. He said he would make sure it was replaced. Low-and-behold, it was not done.

Another example is with your car washes. Each time I have gotten my car washed after a service, the washing has seemed to drop in quality. I understand you are not a carwash, but if you are going to offer to wash your customer's cars - let us know it's going to be half assed before hand so I don't get water marks all over my car and have to go pay for another car wash afterwards.

These last two issues are considerably minor to the others, but it's simply to prove a point. Quality of service is poor, especially for what I'm paying for.

At the end of the day, now I have to schedule another appointment to get my tires rotated and make sure you guys completed all the other aspects of the service I just paid for. I am a very busy man - I work 80-100 hours per week and don't have the time to drive all the way to Garden Grove because of a mistake you guys made - let alone pay for you to give me poor service.

Please get back to me ASAP. My future written review on your website will largely reflect how my situation is handled by whatever manager reviews this email. If I'm being honest, I expect to be adequately compensated for my troubles and time. My time is my most valuable commodity, so you can imagine how frustrating this has been for me. I understand this is not your fault, but nonetheless I figured I'd give your company a chance to correct the issue, make a customer happy, and most importantly improve your process and quality control for other customers in the future.""",3.0
873,"December 07, 2015","Buyer beware!  The car is okay but don't be scammed by the promised lifetime oil change at THIS dealership! (my daughter bought her Hyundai Accent at Glendora Hyundai with free lifetime oil changes and they never pull this fast one on her!)  I have a certificate, that they gave me and my wife when we bought it new three years ago, for free lifetime oil changes.  The car only has 15K on it so my wife always brings it in at the six month interval which is the time frame schedule in lieu of the mileage schedule.  She has never been harassed until today!  She was told that all scheduled maintenance must be performed at 'dealership' to qualify for the free 'lifetime' oil change.  Since part of the 15K scheduled maintenance states to replace the cabin air filter, in which THEY WANT A RIDICULOUS $90.00 TO PERFORM, we void the 'free' lifetime oil change.  Keep in mind it also says to rotate the tires at 15K, now what if I just bought tires and didn't need the rotation?  I plan on filing a false promise claim first through Hyundai and then through the courts if Hyundai does not fix this deceptive practice.  Also note that part of the original purchase negotiation factored in this cost savings which is now just a deceptive joke they played on us!",2.0
874,"December 05, 2015","I had a great experience at this Hyundai dealership which resulted in a purchase of a 2016 Hyundai Sonata. The first salesman that I interacted with was Hans Ham. He was so kind in showing me the different models of cars. I was scared to buy a car becuase I had always heard about how pushy the dealers can be. However, that was not the case at this dealership. Hans was respectful, knowledgeable and patient as I was trying to choose a car. He wasn't even pushy when I told him I wanted to sleep on the choice, I went home to consider the Sonata and it's becuase of Hans that I decided to come back the next day to the dealership to see bout making a deal.
Unfortunately, Hans we not available in the late evening of my return so he referred me to Gilbert Oh. Gilbert was very helpful and I'm glad I was able to make a deal. The entire experience of buying a car was smooth and I would definitely recommend this dealership to my family and co-workers.

Thank you Hans and Gilbert.",4.4

We spoke over the phone & via the internet a few times where he offered me a price for a Hyundai Sonata SE that was the best price from any dealer in my search.  I set up an appointment with Hamid to meet in person and test drive a Sonata SE. The Dealer had the Sonata model and color with the required features in stock. Hamid was very pleasant, professional and knew his product knowledge. He did not rush me on the test drive, but gave me the opportunity to drive the car in different situations including freeway and city traffic. Once we returned, he sat me down to answer any other questions, etc. He stuck with our previous agreed price, where there was no shady sales tactics. I agreed to purchased the car. Going through the paperwork process was seamless and prompt. Once completed, we went back to the car I was purchasing. I was pleasantly surprised to find it freshly washed and with a full tank of gas. Hamid spent quality time going over the bells & whistles of the car. He was patient with me showing features I was not used to and also paired my cell phone with the technology.

911,"October 29, 2015","I'm a proud owner of a 2013 Santa Fe and we just love the car.  What's not to love about it.  We have always been Toyota owners but 3 friends of ours encouraged us to look into Hyundai's.  I've been attracted to Lexus SUV's but my head also turns when I see a Santa Fe.  Moving on, we recently visited your dealership and was first most impressed with Jin.  She was not pushy but very informative/knowledgeable and shared with us the inventory on the ""used"" SUV's are low as they are very popular.  She showed us one on your lot that was in incredible condition however as it was our first stop we decided to check out others we found for sale on-line.  They didn't even measure up.  After returning the next day to test drive the car, we were sold on it and then turned over to Steve Shu.  He is the reason I am really writing this note to you.  
 
Steve was professional yet kind throughout the negotiation of the transaction.  We worked late Friday evening on meeting each other at a point that was ""fair"".  That was just the beginning of a good relationship.  There were 2 items that needed to be repaired on the car and Steve said he would call me Sat. AM with a Monday appt. and he followed through as promised.  That's rare these days.  Secondly, we haven't purchased a car in many years so the technology on the Santa Fe seemed overwhelming to me, especially at 10:00 pm.  He got in the car with me and went over the more important items that evening to drive the car home as well as programming the garage door openers.  He said ""don't hesitate to return soon with any questions you have about the car or to just meet with me and we'll go over every item on the car"".  I returned on Monday to have the repairs done and while there (as it took a bit longer than I expected or have been accustomed to) Steve saw me in your lobby and continually checked on the status of the car and kept me apprised.  
 
After the servicing, he met with me as promised and went over every button and icon in the car.  He even downloaded my outdated cell phone (which he told me did have bluetooth which was a surprise to me) and loaded my cell phone directory into the car.  After reviewing everything else, he then explained in detail the bluetooth link, the distinction between the 3 options on the mirror as well as the Sirius XM program so I could enjoy the free trials.  I didn't even leave the lot and return home without him checking to see that they had been downloaded to my car.  Since then I have again returned to Steve for assistance in downloading my new I-Phone to the car as I couldn't do it by myself.  While there he also went over some other items I had forgotten how they work.
 
In closing, I want you to know that I am very happy I shopped at your location and have been given the incredible service I have been given by everyone, particularly Steve.  I have worked in the corporate world for 36 years and recognize good work ethics and doing your best to make the ""customer"" happy.  We will definitely recommend your dealership as well as Jin & Steve to our friends and family.  We look forward to a good continued relationship with Hardin Hyundai in the future.

I had gone to several Hyundai dealerships, and test drove this car a few times, most of them were very, very pushy, and constantly kept calling me when I had told them upfront that I had to pay off some bills and I would let them know when I was ready to buy. I was turned off by them not listening to what I had said and trying to pressure me to buy right then. I had to come up with the money for my down payment and paying off bills, as I was not trading in my currant vehicle, and wanted my payments at a  certain amount. When I contacted Rene Ortega who was recommended by CarPros radio program, I had sent him a email letting him know what I was looking for and when I was able to come in. In a matter of minutes he got back to me and we set up a time for my husband and I to come in and see what he could do to get me the car I had been waiting 2yrs. to buy. He was wonderful, he found the car in such a short amount of time while we were sitting in his office, but had to have it brought over from another location. He said he could have it there later that day, I told him that I wasn't available until Friday to come back in due to my work schedule, and this was on Sunday that we were at the dealership. He didn't pressure me to try to come in sooner, and boy was that one very long week until Friday came along and I could finally get my new car!!!!

1002,"August 07, 2015","This dealer has the worst sales and finance personnel.  I went to purchase a new Elantra with a pre-approved loan.  I was fortunate to have a discount on the car and the price was set so there were was no negotiation on the price because of the discount.  Tom Bettay who helped us was short and rude with explaining anything.  He had us fill a loan application even though we were not going to finance with them and wanted to run our credit.  When asked why he needed to run our credit, when we were not going to finance with them, he told us it was the law and part of the ""Patriot Act"".  Last I remember the patriot act is a letter signed by president Bush strengthening America by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism.  Was he calling us terrorist?  As a Marine veteran, I was insulted.  I showed him the check and pre-approved letter from our bank.  Tom said that did not matter since ""they wire"" the money and that was not a real check. When I told him that we did not want them to run our credit he appeared upset and left us siting in a table for abut 50 minutes stating he needed to speak to his supervisor.  Tom finally rapidly walked past us as he yelled that the paperwork was with the finance office.  We were shortly directed to a finance guy who was even more rude.  He said it would be easier if they ran our credit because they did not know who we were and by running our credit they could verify our identity. How does running someones credit veryfy identity? I pointed to copies of our Caliifornia driver license that they had and told him we had given them valid ID.  He told us that they did not take the ID's as identification because those could easily ""be made"" and ""bought"" anywhere.  He had an insulting smirk as he went on saying that he could also take my work ID and verify who I was through my employer.  I finally left without a car after an almost two and a half hour process and insults just because they wanted to run my credit.",1.4

Out of the 5 TRUECar dealers that responded to me, Steve Cooke at Hardin Hyundai stood out with his promise of a ""low price up front"" and follow-through with numbers to back it up, plus his email responsiveness to my many questions. The other dealers just kept calling and saying ""come on in and we'll make you a deal"", hinting at a long process of back-and-forth haggling that I was trying to avoid (some even didn't have inventory on 2013 models).  After Steve gave me his lowest price, I drove my 13-yr old Honda Odyssey (250K miles) into Hardin that night to see what kind of trade-in value I could get.

Since I came in an hour before closing time, Rene and the finance manager Steve Gannon had to stay late to finish my paperwork, but they remained friendly and polite throughout.  I was truly impressed with how efficient, pleasant, and painless this whole experience was, thanks to Steve Cooke and Rene Ortega at Hardin Hyundai (who also continue to follow-up with me post-sale).  TRUECar.com provided the leads to Hardin, but the responsiveness and no-hassle professionalism of Steve and Rene were what sold me on the great deal they put together.",5.0
1051,"January 02, 2014","Previously leased from Internet Sales (Steve C.) and had great experience.

Three years later... not so much.

So Steve and I email back and forth a bit and agree on price for Santa Fe Sport.  I then wanted to add the Premium package and Steve says it'll be about $3k more and about $10-15 per month (per email).

We go down to dealer (traveling from south county) expecting to lease based on the above info.  We start talking pricing and he's way off from emails.  Show him email and then he starts the typical numbers shuffle.  This is what I try to avoid by dealing with Internet/fleet.  After continually turning him down and restating what he said in email, he then he runs to get manager.

So 'manager' (wish I could recall his name) shows up and starts the hard sell.  Says Steve 'made a mistake' and he should've said '$10-15 more per $1000'.  So $30-45 more per month.  So I call BS (in a nice way) and let him know.  Still won't budge and starts another round of numbers fun.  Tell him no thanks and get up to leave.  Hold out hand to shake it and he won't even be bothered with it.  Arrogant

It amazes me that in 2013 there are still car dealers with people such as this.  Not only have you lost a repeat customer and sale, you'll continue to lose more with sites such as Yelp, Dealerrater and Edmunds (my next stop).

It has been over 5 months now and I am still as mad as the day(s) I spent at Hardin Hyundai.   To make a long story short, I bought a used Yukon from them. I live in Hesperia, so I traveled close to 70 miles to do this.  Over a 2 week period, I had a salesman lie to me (told me the car was the owner's sons' car), had the finance department try to switch the warranty price on me during the contract signing, had the finance dept give me extremely rude service, traveled 70 miles with my family to find out promised repairs were not even started after the salesman had called me and promised that they were done, had the salesman tell me ""nothing will make you happy"", had the general manager totally ignore my calls, emailed the owner and had the owner's son call me just to have him tell me ""well they are ALL my cars"", had that same gentleman dismiss all my concerns, and then ignored by the owner after I emailed him again.  I never wanted to return the car, I only wanted some sign of accountability. No customer should ever be treated in the manner I was. I sincerely hope that this review, along with the multiple others I see on this site, persuade people to completely avoid this dealership, as well as all the other Hardin dealerships.",1.0

1057,"July 01, 2013","I'll keep this short although the headaches I've had with this dealership could fill a dissertation. In 2011 I purchased a pre-owned Nissan 350z. I had problems from the beginning with the dealership. I bought the car with a due bill to get some tinting removed and without getting a smog check. The dealership informed me they would take care of the due bill and pay for the smog check. It was a complete nightmare to get them to do the work but eventually they did.

Here is why I would really avoid this place, not that I had planned on going back anyways, I purchased the car with the understanding that it had one prior owner and was never in an accident. I was even showed a Carfax which confirmed it. Today I looked at purchasing a new car and got the dealership to give me a trade in quote. When they came back with the quote they asked me about the accident my car had been in in 2008. This was a huge shock to me as I bought a car without any prior accidents. Sure enough though, they had a Carfax showing my car had definitely been in an accident.

1058,"June 08, 2013","I purchased a 2013 Hyundai Sonata and was most pleased with the experience.  I approached Rene Ortega and 10 other dealers with a non-traditional proposal:  I would give them one chance to make their best bid (and one chance to counter the best bid) at a car with my preferred specifications.  Many dealers did not welcome this approach, instead they wanted me to come in and at the end reluctantly agreed to give me a bid.  The end results are as follows: one didn't want to compete so he opted out; a few didn't send a bid after agreeing and after a follow up call; one sent me a frivolous low ball bid which I suspect wasn't going to be honored; and only three sent me a serious offer.  Rene Ortega was among the three and his quote was the lowest and no one was willing to match it.  In fact one dealer aggressively tried to convince me that although his quote was higher and his car had less value in factory options, purchasing his car would be the better deal.  So I called the dealer to give him a chance to counter and what I got instead was a high pressure pitch mixed with deception, which only stopped when I informed the dealer that I am a math teacher and was not following the math.  Dealing with Rene was much easier: less pressure, and simpler responses that I understood immediately.  Next time I am searching for a Hyundai, I will definitely contact Rene first.

Everything was good.  they gave the Keys and manual before i was sent to the finance dept, Mel came back telling that there was a $500 competitor discount that was given to me (he didn't tell me that the previous day).  Now, he wanted proof that i owned another vehicle to get the discount.  i don't own another vehicle, so could not give proof.  

MEL canceled the deal for both the cars and started blaming me for wasting his time.  he started talking rough and tried his best to pickup a fight.  This guy, working as a car salesman, needs to be trained by Hardin about treating customers better.

i have been a Toyota / Honda customer all these years and have NEVER had such a bad dealership experience like i had with MEL at Hardin Hyundai.

1069,"November 18, 2012","Horrible customer sales experience!

Unfortunately, I have to pick at least one star otherwise I would have gave them zero!

No wonder their competitor, Harbor Hyundai, has much better ratings because of all the upset customers from this dealer going to them.

No wonder this dealer has only 2.5 Yelp stars and most reviewers has bad customer service experience as a common problem.

Please note that my experience is based upon one SALES individual name Leasandro/Lesandro/Lezandro on the phone. Please also note that this was my first time ever to call this dealer. This guy is a Fleet Manager supposedly!

Ok, so I called this dealer yesterday because I am shopping for a new car and need to buy it either this weekend or the one after. I had the quote from the other dealer and wanted to shop around to find even a better deal. After giving all the necessary information to this guy name Tom, he ask me for the lowest price I already have. After listening to it he told me that it will be useless for him to tell his low price. I told him that as promised I gave him my price so he should do the same. After little argument, he finally agreed to give me his price but told me to wait for his call back.

After 30 mins, I got a call from this guy Leasandro/Lesandro/Lezandro claiming to be a Fleet Manager to help me out. I told him everything pretty much all over again and asked him to give me his price. Right away, he gave me an impression of a ""Know it All"" type guy and talked to me like that the entire time. Again, I asked him about the price and he started to tell me that he can beat any dealer's any low price at any time guaranteed! He also said that he can beat it by few hundreds. He continued by saying that there is a reason on why he is a # 1 Hyundai Western volume seller and no body can beat or match his price. Period!

At this point, I was 50-50 in terms of giving this dealer my business or not.

Anyways, I told him my price and asked him if he can beat this by hundreds like he promised earlier. He immediately said Yes! I told him that my price is before any rebates and this is where I busted him with his lies!

Right away, he told me that it is impossible for any dealer in the entire Western region to offer me the price, I had, without any rebates. He said that it is next to impossible and that other dealer is lying to me. I told him that I did indeed verify the price from the other dealer more than 1 time and they have assured me that the price is before any rebates. He still argued with me and kept telling me that the other dealer is lying and that he is telling me the correct price which he is darn sure that no body can beat it!

At this point I told him that I can take him to this other low price dealer website and can proof the price that way. After guiding him through this other dealer website, I showed him the low price which he claimed earlier that no body in the entire Western region can offer!

I heard a complete silence on the phone. I then asked if he is seeing the price or not. He then responded if I am looking for a manual transmission and I said No. He then said that the price the other dealer has is for manual transmission and just by looking at the price he can tell that.

I knew this was a big lie so right away I told him that it clearly states in the fine print that the car and price is for auto transmission. Also, I called the other dealer and did verify through that as well!

As he was totally busted with his ""big talking earlier"" and lies, right away he started to make excuses. His voice becomes dim and there was no ""Know All Type"" attitude. All of a sudden, he told me that he can match the price for the same exact car! Now keep in mind that his earlier ""last/final/best quote"" was at least 1000 more. So, how come all of a sudden he can match the price but earlier told me that the entire Western region cannot do it without any rebates?

There was answer as well as no apology for all his lies. Instead, he became aggressive and told me, ""Now I am telling you that I do have a car...I can beat that price....Do you want to argue or need a car""

What a joke!

At the end, he told me to just go to the other dealer and buy from there!

WoW! Just WoW!

Amazing to see on what kind of staff, who claim to be a manager, dealer has who has no respect, courtesy, or friendliness to a brand new first time customer like me! How can I think about this dealer for any current, future purchases or for recommending it to others?

Like I said, my experience is based on a guy Leasandro/Lesandro/Lezandro at Sales department who claim to be a Fleet Manager. This dealer may have other good people but needless to say that this dealer will not get any of my business for sure! First impression is huge for me!

He was very kind and was able to work some numbers for my husband and me over the phone. We told him we could be there at 9am to see him the following Tuesday. He said he was not scheduled till 10 but he would be there for us. From the moment we arrived the experience was just awesome. We felt so comfortable speaking with Rene and the guy in finance.

1085,"October 30, 2011","This family owned dealership bends over backwards to do the right thing, not just make a sale.  Rene has even helped a friend who was having trouble with the unhelpful people at Cerritos Hyundai.  We've had our Elantra now for 4 months--it's been a great car for my daughter and the people at this dealership are just as great now as they were when we bought the car.  If you are thinking about a Hyundai, go here.",5.0
1086,"October 26, 2011"," This dealership is completely unprofessional and treats customers like a dirt. The general sales manager guy named Chris Lancaster is an absolute JOKE.  He doesn't even have a basic etiquette of salesmanship.  My husband went into negotiate a car for my son and reached a deal with a sales person.  However because it was a night time, he decided to come back the next day with my son.  They wanted to close the deal and requested that he put down some security deposit.  My husband obliged and wrote a check out for $500.  As he was leaving, the general sales manager comes out and tells my husband to instead use his credit card.  My husband did not want to do that and told him he will be back in the morning to test drive the car etc.  Then  this general manager Chris guy began to pressure my husband.    When he didn't budge, the manager guy actually told my husband to ""get out.""   
I don't know if this guy thinks he can be rude to Hyundai buyer or not but we were never humiliated and never been treated like this ever in any dealership.     
We will never come back to this dealership and will write a complaint letter  to the Hyundai America motor corporation.  The guy should be fired.!!!",1.0
1087,"August 18, 2011","SUCK!!! DON'T GO HERE!! This place is horrendous just as bad as OC TUSTIN HYUNDAI!
YELP IT AND SEE FOR YOURSELF! They took my money to ""supposedly"" bring in the car I asked for since they did not have it in the color I wanted. They gave me all kinds of stupid stories as to why they could not locate the car yet when they took my $1000 check they assured me they'd have it by the next day!! Funny that when I finally got smart and started calling other dealers, I WAS able to find the car in like 3 different places. THEY JUST WANTED TO HAVE ME SETTLE FOR WHAT THEY HAD IN STOCK IN ORDER TO MAKE MORE $ OFF ME!!
They promise all kinds of great stuff and incentives but it's all B.S.",1.0
1088,"June 13, 2011",I had been to two other dealers prior to Hardin while trying to find the best deal on a 2011 Sonata.  Hardin is not even in my area but it turned out to be worth the drive as Hamid worked with me to give me everything I wanted on my new vehicle as well as my trade-in.  They also had a very large stock of vehicles to choose from. They had the color of vehicle I was looking for while the other dealers did not.  I love my new Sonata and am very grateful for Hamid's exceptional service!!,5.0
1089,"January 03, 2011","We had the best car buying experience possible.  Steve Cooke was upfront, honest and quick.  We knew what we were getting before we walked in to the dealership.  He treated us with respect and the price was phenomenal.  We drove over 60 miles to buy our new Hyundai, and would do it again.  The drive was worth it.  We truly cannot say enough good things about Steve Cooke.  He was probably the most knowledgeable salesman we have ever come across.  We strongly recommend this dealership and Steve Cooke for your car buying experience.",5.0
1090,"November 10, 2010","I used the Costco Auto program which made my purchasing process very efficient.  What made a difference for me between dealerships, is that I got an offer via email from Hardin, and that too, very promptly.  That saved me a lot of time and effort.  I wasn't relishing the haggling and back and forth.  I was able to complete the transaction within 24 hours.  Thomas (salesperson) was very friendly and efficient.  Great price through Costco Auto program.",4.5
1091,"November 04, 2010","These people at this dealership are crooks!  I tried to purcahse a new vehicle and the sticker price was $21,300.  I wanted to see the invoice price and they did not show it to me.  I was trying to get a good price and find a way for it to fit into my budget.  By the time I got to the ""finance"" guy, the price of the car was $23,480.  I have no idea how it went up over $2,000.  then they wanted to add on the tax, license, doc fees, etc. and the final price ballooned to a $26,000 price tag.
These guys are nice and fun to your face, but customer service is not what they really care about.  They are unwilling to help when you need it and try to weasle out of anything they can.
Go ceck them out on the Better Business Bureau, as they are rated an F (the worst rating you can get).

Do not buy a car from this dealership and go get a better deal somewhere else!",1.0
1092,"October 19, 2010","Thank you for your compliments on dealing with Marilyn and I in the purchase of our great new Sonata!  We also wish to thank you for your tremendous help in making us through a very important event in our lives.  We enjoyed your help, friendship, and professionalism, and making us feel at ease throughout the entire process.  When we left the dealership, with our new car, we felt that you were more like a friend rather than just someone who wanted to sell us a car.
  We enjoyed ou experience also with the gentleman who assited us with the financing end of the deal.  Please give him our warmest wishes.  I hope we don't have to distrub you with silly questons.  We really love our car!  The more w drive it, the more we love it.
