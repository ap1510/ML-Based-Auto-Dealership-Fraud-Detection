0,18-Sep-19,"Went here to purchase a vehicle for my daughter for her birthday, and was greeted by a younger salesman. I went to shake his hand and was met with a sweaty, greasy handshake. This was a major turn-off for me, but I continued on with the young salesman. He was extremely immature, and kept making sexual references in conjunction with the vehicles on the lot, saying things like ""I would make love to the Genesis"" and ""The Veloster N is a ride your daughter wouldn't survive"". He kept saying how much he can't wait to get his hands on a Veloster N. Well, I wouldn't let this salesman put his hands on anything, because they are greasier than most cheeseburgers I've ever eaten! I believe the salesman's name was ""Perry"" or ""Pierre"", not quite sure. Either way, I will not be returning to this dealership anytime soon.",1,Disrespectful
2,23-Jul-18,"2012 Genesis will seat belt alarm that would not go off.  61K miles, warranty expired at 60K.  3X to fix then they tried to upsell me with a $2700 instrument cluster with no guarantee it would fix the problem.  I had asked to Hyundai goodwill on the repair and they told me it was denied and would not give me a case # (said there is none),  When I called corporate, with Vin # I received a case number and they never ruled, said dealer withdrew claim.
Final result; repaired by Escondido Hyundai under goodwill with no instrument cluster.  Short in the belt wiring!!",1,Upsold needless instrument
157,13-May-17,"the sales person was very aggressively pushing for stuff that I did not need like LoJack and something else that I don't even know what it was. Initially he was trying to charge me 800$ for LoJack. Wasted time to argue and his trip to his manager to bring it down to 300$. I did not want to pay for that at all, but the sales person lied saying he could not physically remove LoJack from the car, so I had no choice, but to pay for it. Later I found out that it simply had to be digitally deactivated and his statement that he could not physically take it out of the car was misleading at best and simply a lie at worst just to make me pay more for the car. The sales person also insisted that I had to do Hyundai loan at 5.9%. I wanted to pay 100% cash, but again the sales person insisted I had no choice. He did not even mention there was 750$ promo if I go for Hyunday loan, so I did not take advantage of that promo to save 750$. In short, the sales person was a jerk full of lies. My experience sucked - it took several hours to complete the purchase - most of that time spent on price arguments. The car selling industry sucks exactly because of people like that. Hyundai should simply sell cars at their standard prices and take negotiation out of the car buying process. I am very frustrated with my buying experience, thus this negative review.",1,"Extra charge for non optional product, Credit other than cash, "
486,04-Aug-15,Dishonest dealership and dishonest employees. Avoid buying a car from this dealer. You will not be treated with respect and you will not be treated honestly.  ,1,
502,27-May-11,"We ordered a new Elantra Limited edition and asked what would the price be and were told we would have to  pay sticker price since this car was in big demand and short supply.  We gave this dealer a deposit and waited seven weeks to get delivery.   We were called and told that our car had arrived and was ready for us to pick up.

We arrived that same night and started to go thru the paper work and at the very end we noticed that the sales price was almost $800.00 OVER sticker price.  They had added $495.00 for window tinting and the windows were not tinted and $300.00 for sticker that were on all the doors and hood and trunk.  We were told these were to identify the parts in case the car was stolen and somehow got to a chop shop.

When we balked at the increase in cost Todd said he would take off the price of the window tint, but we still had to pay the additional $300.00 for the stickers.  I reminded him of our initial conversation about paying ""Sticker"" price and after being at this dealer for three hours, he told me, ""my position is basically this, if you don't buy the car, I'll just sell it to someone else!""

I have worked in sales all my life and have NEVER treated a customer the way this guy treated me and my wife.  He couldn't care less about charging us more then he agreed on and wasn't apologetic in any way.   Very rude, especially for a so called General Manager!   If you go to this dealer, get everything in writing first and then hope for the best!   We went to Escondido Hyundai the next day and got the same car with no extra charges and we were treated like ""Real Customers""",1.3,
303,04-Oct-16,"Sales staff wasn't informative, didn't go over all the features or explain the features to me in the car the general manager was very pushy and aggressive and pressure sales tactics",1.7,
7,14-Dec-17,"I thought the salesman, Christian Alvarez, was great--he was honest and straightforward. The dealership's practice of automatically adding Lo-Jack to every car as a way of boosting their profits, was very upsetting--it turned what could have been a great experience into one that took a couple of days and was frustrating. Why should I have to fight to not pay for something that I never wanted to have to begin with? There were times that I was ready to buy a different brand car because of the hassle, and the sales manager, when he eventually relented and agreed to remove the charge for the Lo-Jack (after repeatedly telling me he couldn't remove the charge), treated me like I was being unreasonable--truly, I was two minutes away from buying a Mazda.",2,
102,06-Jul-17,"Do not buy from here. I was given a price up front by Cody Didyoung and specifically asked if there was anything dealer added, and was told no. I guess they forgot to mention the additional $300 charge for VIN stickers they add onto the doors. I made an appointment and was told the car would be ready when I got there. It wasn't. The department that preps vehicles did a horrible job. Sticker goo was left on the rear windows and the front tires were over inflated by 4 pounds. The engine bay looks like someone dumped a 40lb bag of sand in it (I guess that's my fault for assuming the engine bay would be clean). The coolant and windshield wiper fluid weren't anywhere near full, and I feel 23 miles on a car I was told was ""just off the truck"" is a tad excessive. The bottom line is poor attention to detail, things you don't see at some other manufacturer's dealerships. Don't settle for substandard treatment, here or anywhere else.  I contacted the dealership about the above faults with the car and was told the email would be forwarded to the service department, detail department, and the manager. It's been 10 days, and no one has contacted me to offer to fix the issues or even to apologize. Their lack of customer service would give Comcast a run for their money.",2.2,
237,17-Jan-17,Financed amount was more than I was told. Payments were higher than I was told. I called the dealership multiple times and left numerous messages and never got a call back. Horrible customer service.,2.4,
367,01-Jun-16,I was unsatisfied with what was told to me. I was told I was going to get money back on my military rebate and I did not.,2.6,
420,18-Jan-16,My experience at hyundai was below average compared ro the other experiences that I've had at other dealerships. I would still recommend this dealership to other people still. ,2.6,
21,20-Nov-17,How do you think I felt after driving 2 hours to get to the dealer and shown the car I was going to purchase as we agreed on the phone and then told it was sold to someone else.,2.8,
42,21-Oct-17,Had a good experience with my salesperson but the sales manager was unprofessional and rude. I’ve already tried contacting the branch manager about the behavior but haven’t gotten any response. I also provided more detailed feedback on the previous page.,2.8,
493,20-Jul-15,I was exiting the store when the payment was too high for me. The general manager stopped and talked with me. After speaking with the bank we shook hands on $350 a month. I asked if adding my daughter to help her credit was possible. They ran my daughters credit 7 times which dropped her score 23 points and ultimately didn't add her to the loan because of a clerical error by Equifax. Because she wasn't added to the loan they increased my monthly payment by $10. She was never apart of the original deal when I shook at $350. I was told the $14 difference was gap insurance however the gap was only $4 per month. After they put the loan through my name we called both people we talked to. We never heard back.,2.8,
142,28-May-17,"DURING PURCHASE OTHER UNOCCUPIED SALES PERSONNEL WERE NEARBY JOKING AND LAUGHING WHICH WAS DISTRACTING.WAS NOT TOLD BEFOREHAND THAT A CASHIERS CHECK WOULD BE REQUIRED.  THE DAY BEFORE WHEN I SAID I WOULD WRITE A PERSONAL CHECK, NO OBJECTION WAS VOICED.  THIS REQUIRED A TRIP TO MY BANK WHICH COULD HAVE AVOIDED.",3,
323,04-Aug-16,"Overall I would not reccomend this location to purchase a vehicle. First, I'd like to say I do feel like I received an excellent deal which is why I ended up buying the car but that is about it. I made two visits to Hyundai and worked with Alex both times. The first time we went on a short test drive.  I went back the next day asking to do another so that my boyfriend could get the feel as well.  During the drive I asked Alex a few questions we went over the day before and he responded, ""I've done about 30 deals over the last day so I don't remember.""  Way to make me feel like a valued customer.  If anything I actually felt like an inconvenience to him.    Once I decided to purchase the car, again strictly due to the good price, there was zero time spent reviewing the features of the car, I spent $30k and didn't even know there was a lift gate button in the back or that I had wifi and the ability to download apps.  There are still some features I have no idea how to use.  I understand that we purchased the vehicle at the very end of the day so they were not able to do a full detail, which was no problem as Alex said I could come by later in the week.  Also, he did not do a walk around or anything with me.  He just had me sign papers saying everything would be taken care of when I came back for the full detail.  The next morning once it was light outside, I realized there were some light scratches on the front right bumper.  I emailed Alex and he said they'd ""See what they could do"" during the detail.  Unfortunately after it was worked on it the scratches are still there.  I will say I have been to the service department twice now, one for a car wash and two for the detail and both times I have received friendly service so I will probably continue to go back for my service needs.    At the end of the day, thanks for the great deal and I am really loving the car and fortunately I'm a good googler so as I've had questions about the features I have been looking them up myself.",3.2,
402,22-Mar-16,tried to cancel lo jack. no response from sales.good sales presentation employes are great.wish I did not have lo jack experience.in the future you should be more upfront with customer.we should not have to read every word. there should be more trust.try to be fair,3.4,
412,10-Mar-16,The salesman was nice and the dealership was clean but the price I got was not the same as the price agreed on before I went there.,3.4,
177,24-Apr-17,"I felt the people I dealt  with were helpful and friendly,but I was not aware of some of the items I was agreeing to. In retrospect I would not have signed off t he Lojack and warranty which I certainly  did not need, I also felt  the  trade in value was too low.",3.6,
399,25-Mar-16,"Overall, I am pleased with the dealership. Although I do believe the people I worked with could have been more accommodating. There were items on the deal that were not fully explained and that I did not have appropriate time to discuss. This was MY fault, but I believe the pressure was deliberate.",3.6,
261,08-Dec-16,I went in not looking to come out with a new car. They were not pushy. Gave all info needed. They made the process easy,3.8,
297,06-Oct-16,Salesforce is great –  Alex the Internet sales manager was extremely professional and moved the process forward – finance lady  was sick and the closing process took way too much time – you need a back up plan – One of the cars had a small service issue and dealing with your service was a nightmare.,3.8,
319,11-Aug-16,I was promised 90 days no payment and contract reads first payment is next month in September I was betrayed the ad says 90 days no payment,3.8,
356,11-Jun-16,"I love my new car, however, I thought it was unfair and unprofessional for my salesman to try to trick me into getting the 10,000 mile/year lease vs. the 12,000 mile/year lease. I would've gone way over and I would've been charged for that.",3.8,
131,09-Jun-17,"salesman, christian, was very good.  Had a poor experience with EScondido Hyundai just before coming to carlsbad hyundai dealer.  Carlsbad Hyundai was much better. sss  ssss sss ss ss  s   ssss s s s s s  ssss s s s s",4,

218,24-Feb-17,Staff was friendly and professional. Not great at follow up though. Still waiting on a call regarding ding removal and missing floor mats. That is all,4,
239,15-Jan-17,"Overall, the experience was good. Could not pin down the actual cost based on data I had researched before I visited the dealership. I am happy with the Elantra and overall, I was treated with respect.",4,
300,06-Oct-16,We purchased a santa fe from Manny a couple of months ago and the process was quick and easy. We appreciate his help and are enjoying our car.,4,
336,16-Jul-16,The whole experience was professional and agile. The dealer was genuinely interested in helping me achieve my needs. He demonstrated excellent customer service and care and I appreciated his work ethic.,4,
382,06-May-16,Kept pricing and service as promised no surprises. I recommend buying your next car from here because they didn't have the car I wanted they traded with another dealer to get it.,4,
403,21-Mar-16,Was treated well. Dealer was very informative and made sure I was well taken care of. I would definitely come back again for my next purchase,4,
417,08-Feb-16,"Loved my old 2001 Santa Fe but it was time for a new Tucson. It's the envy of work parking lot.

Alex really helped my experience be a positive one and reduced some of the new-purchase jitters.

I thought I was ready to buy last year but the other dealership wasn't the right fit. Glad I truated my instincts and went with another Hyundai.",4,
14,01-Dec-17,I loved working with Josh in sales and the whole team. Very friendly and knowledgeable. This is my second car and will likely be looking for another one in 3 yrs. Thank you and Keep it up!,4.2,
51,07-Oct-17,Christian is excellent--as is the sales manager Robert. Ialso found the finance person extrememely professional and easy to work with. I found poor follow up on the part of other sales folks,4.2,
194,29-Mar-17,"The dealership (Sean Martin) kept in contact with us for three months after we first inquired about the Ioniq after seeing it at the LA Auto Show  By the way - I was not allowed to leave a comment about Sean Martin (below), but he was patient, attentive, a good communicator and he let us feel our way through the process. We thought that he did a great job.",4.2,
236,17-Jan-17,Emanuel was awesome. He explained the differences between models and found the right car for us.  The sales manager helped make a great deal and finance was friendly and quick.,4.2,
272,19-Nov-16,"My overall experience with getting here, getting approved, to driving away was all in good timing. Not too fast and not to long. Thanks for considering us and our needs.  What I would say though, is before pulling up a vehicle to the door that the customer didn't even pick out, you talk with them about color of the vehicle, test driving it, and also pricing. I didn't test drive it until the leasing process was almost done nor did I know I was leasing it until I walked in the finance office. Being transparent and vulnerable to a customers feelings about how the process goes is very crucial. 45% of this decision for a new vehicle is emotional, which could escalate and very possibly be given an automatic thumbs down due to how much their opinions were considered in what vehicle the ""dealership picked out"" verses having that initial ground work done of the buyers satisfaction.",4.2,
358,10-Jun-16,"make sure you get every thing you bargained for and learn everything about your controls and features and make sure they work properly before you sign the papers. I made the mistake of buying when busy and had to come back a couple days later for instructions on use of features and found I did not get what I was promised. I was supposed to get navigation features in dash without use of separate devices if I subscribed to the Blue Link feature but wen the dealer and activated it we found it was not available for this system and I had to get a smartphone with a navigator ap and plug it in to my system as a separate device (at a cost of $50+/- per month). I should have had the dealer operate the navigation before I signed the papers. Needless to say I was very disappointed. Even the salesman was surprised that it didn't work but, too late, I already signed the papers.",4.2,
360,09-Jun-16,My third Santa Fe. Becomming more refined with better ride and elctronic goodies. So the transaction did not required a lot of operational details. Low keyed perfessional sales person was what I wanted.,4.2,
436,08-Dec-15,"I got a new 2016 Sonata Hybrid at reasonable price during Black Friday 2015. I did some homework, contacted internet manager, and drove this car 2 weeks before buying it. After I disagreed with the offered price it was lowered to my satisfaction. Overall it was a good buying experience.",4.2,
476,18-Aug-15,The services was good and the vehicles were good. The sales staff was friendly and helpful but I did notice some issues that comes with the negotiation of buying a car. The major one was intentionally providing wrong pricing for a trade in car price until the paperwork was needing to be signed.,4.2,
481,12-Aug-15,They were friendly and didn't pressure us like other dealerships. We came back multiple times to make sure we got the right vehicle and price for us.,4.2,
225,10-Feb-17,Attentive to my inquiries and willing to help answering any questions and help understand vehicle technology  I wasn't satisfied with financial manager I paid for vehicle cash and didn't need any finance from dealer but she kept pushing for her own finance,4.3,
426,06-Jan-16,"Timely professional sale.  Eric didn't seem like a high-pressure sales guy, I already knew which vehicle I wanted when I came in, and they got it for me at the price I wanted.  ",4.3,
5,23-Dec-17,"We first looked at the car in September.  We were away for 2-3 weeks. Sales rep contacted us once by email while away. Very courteous & professional.  When we got ready for purchase, sales rep recalled our previous discussions. Made the process much more efficient.",4.4,
9,13-Dec-17,"The vehicle was ""washed"" at time of picking it up but when Alec from sales saw the poor job they did he immediately offered to make it right and have the vehicle detailed. I brought the SUV a few days later for that detailed wash and for my surprise they have only buffered off a small section where some scratches were reported not even washing the SUV at all. I reported this to Alec and he apologized and offered to detailed the car at my convenience. After I return from a trip today,  I brought the SUV for that so mentioned detailed wash. To my disappointment, for the 3rd time, the car was basically wash off . Water stains all over, no shiny tires, still red paint from promotion price over windows, dirt stains here and there . Really disappointed with how they ""wash/detaile"" vehicles. Made an appointment with my personal car wash person to do a full detail since it seems Hyundai can't get it done.",4.4,
40,25-Oct-17,"The price was great, the employees were friendly, but something as simple as a follow up call for a test drive gift card never happened.  Its the classic scenario great when you purchase, then no follow up.  I might add, a friend did the test drive at a different Hyundai dealership & got the e-mail with the gift card the same day.  Left messages with the GM, no return call!!",4.4,
55,27-Sep-17,"From several service appointments for my Hyundai Accent, I have grown to trust the honesty and integrity of this dealership's service department. It has helped to be a Costco member, having the benefit of 15% off coupons applied to the service bills. In spring 2017 I received a letter from Hyundai about a defect in the passenger seat air bag and made an appointment on May 1, 2017 to have the defect repaired. The service dept called to postpone the appointment as they had not received the necessary parts but promised to call to reschedule when the parts came in. I have not received a call-back to reschedule for this (warranty ?) work to be done. On Sept 4, 2017 I purchased a 2017 Hyundai Ioniq Blue from the sales department through the Costco Auto Buying Program. Although I have had buyer's remorse over the purchase, the sales representative Emmanuel Rodrigues did his utmost to serve me courteously, patiently and professionally. In particular, he stayed as late as necessary to serve me when the designated Costco representative was unavailable; we went to the storage lot to  exchange a higher-model Ioniq with the Hybrid Blue I was interested in; when scratches were discovered in Hybrid Blue which we had picked up that I had test-driven, Emmanuel asked a driver to pick up an unblemished Hybrid Blue from the storage lot in my desired color and my preferred interior; when I objected to paying for LoJack and Express Code, Emmanuel called in his manager who heard me out and agreed to remove the charges; when I expressed concern about the lack of a spare tire, Emmanuel sought authority to agree to install a spare tire upon appointment for $250.00; when I agreed to move forward with the proposed finance contract, he transferred me quickly to the Finance Manager to complete the paperwork so I would not be delayed by other buyers needing to complete paperwork the same evening.  Emmanuel dealt with each of my concerns and answered my questions without exerting pressure on me to buy. ted no pressure on me to",4.4,
57,25-Sep-17,Aaron was the best! He was very attentive and worked quickly with us. We were in and out in two and a half hours and that included two test drives. We knew what we were looking for and he was very helpful. There was another salesman that approached us first and he was not very friendly and was not very knowledgeable of the cars. He left us to work with someone else and than Aaron approached us which was wonderful!,4.4,

344,06-Jul-16,"I negotiated the price of the car before going to the dealership.  The internet sales manager Alex was very easy to work with.  Once we agreed on the price, he got the car ready for our arrival and the whole process took less than 1.5 hrs, including the test drive of the vehicle.

124,12-Jun-17,Second experience at this car dealership. First time a purchase. This time a lease. Our sales person was extremely knowledgeable about the Santa Fe. We aquired a vehicle with so many bells and whistles  that I could not beleave he had all that information in his head for every question we asked. He was so nice he said stop in any time if we had questions and he could repeat the instructions any time. Catherine was equally as qualified in all the explanations of our paper work.

408,11-Mar-16,"On 2/29/16 I arrived to the dealership I had previously called to advise my salesman Alex Peterson, the internet manager, that I would be arriving at a set time so that the cars I wanted to see would be available. There were 2 of the 3 color combinations that they claimed to have and I  travelled over 1 hour to see. The excuse that one of the cars was not available was that the car had technical problems and they could not release it in that condition to me. Lucky for me the color I liked was available, and that's the one I purchased. The only other thing that I didn't like very much was that I was being forced to pay for an alarm system that was pre-installed in my vehicle that seemed over priced and not of my choosing. It was resolved to get it at a discounted rate that I agreed to pay for. Then came the finance dept. where Ms. Catherine Alvarez took me through my choices for financing, and sold me an extended warranty. The explanation of that warranty was not precise, I didn't have time to read the fine print at the time and it was quite expensive for what it covered after thoughroughly reading the fine print. I called the next day to have it removed but but never received a call back from Ms. Alvarez or anyone at the dealership until 2 days later, since I also wasn't given the owner's manual nor the charging cord that came with the vehicle on the delivery date, I agreed to drive to the dealership to pickup those items and resolve the removal of the extended warranty.  I was assured by the sales manager Robert Wilson and my salesman Alex Peterson that everything would be resolved to my satisfaction, and that confirmation of that would come by mail. As of 3/10/16  I have not received anything and the loan papers I received on 3/9/16 seems to have all of the original charges including the extended warranty still. 3/10/16 I called Alex no answer, then Robert at the dealership and was told that he would speak to Catherine to inform me about what has been done to resolve this.",4.6,

15,01-Dec-17,"North County Hyundai was worth the trip from Temecula. Their selection of new and PO vehicles (Santa Fe and Tucsons) was larger than most other dealerships. Staff was not aggressive; Joe listened to my needs and offered several options -- with knowledgeable discussions of each. Hyundai's model offerings are somewhat complicated; however, my sales person (Joe) helped me understand each along with the price trade-offs. In the end, I found a model with all the amenities I requested (save one). I was able to purchase a great vehicle at a good price. Their finance staff was very helpful and made the purchase a pleasant experience. I would definitely consider another purchase from North County Hyundai. Unfortunately, they are too far from my home in Temecula for servicing -- therefore, I will be using the Temecula dealership for my service needs.",4.8,

241,10-Jan-17,The team at North County Hyundai of Carlsbad ranks number one on my list of purchase experiences since I've started purchasing cars for the past 20 years.

258,12-Dec-16,"THE BEST car buying experience ever!  The wife and I set out to specifically purchase either the Honda Civic or Hyundai Elantra. We went to Hyundai first, thinking we would end up with a Civic- but wanted to see what Hyundai had to offer. We did some internet research the day prior so we were a little familiar with both vehicles. We were greeted by Emmanuel Rodriguez shortly after browsing the lot. We were upfront with him and told him which two vehicles and dealerships we were considering and left it up to him to do his job- AND DID HE. We told him what features were important to us, and most importantly what price we wanted to be at (we had a check in hand so we were going to buy a car somewhere lol!) Emmanuel was EXTREMELY informative, patient, and most importantly honest. We left the dealership to head over to Honda- just for comparison, and the salesman didn't have us after 10 min. We called Emmanuel to tell him to send our new 2017 Elantra over to detail because we're coming back!   We're a military couple and we've had our share of vehicles over the years. But Emmanuel has to be the best salesman we've ever had the pleasure to work with. While he was preparing the paperwork and having the car cleaned and gassed up, we went over to PF Changs for lunch and even picked up lunch for Emmanuel (he likes the Mongolian platter). Overall, we are extremely satisfied with our purchase. There isn't a feature on that car we weren't shown. I'm not sure who's the manager or how long Emmanuel has been working there, but he needs to be recognized and rewarded. Everyone dreads going to dealerships because we need a car but don't want to feel like we're eskimo's buying snow- if you get what I mean. Very rarely does authenticity show up. We didn't buy the car, we bought into Manny. THANK YOU! Lita & Mike",4.8,

425,07-Jan-16,"I originally came here just trying to kill some time to look at the new Genesis. I was greeted promptly when I arrived and let the salesman know I was strictly looking and not in the market to buy. I've seen the new Genesis on the road and wanted to come take a look at it and see it up close and personal. Emmanuel Rodriguez was extremely courteous and not pushy at all. He answer all the questions I had and opened up a couple different car so I could look and sit in them. Even though he knew I was not in the market to buy that day he asked if I wanted to take a car out for a test drive which I said yes too. While on the test right he did an amazing job of explaining all of the different features that the car had. Upon arriving back to the dealership he asked me if I wanted to take a look at the numbers to see what the car would cost. He went over the options of buying or leasing the car. I had absolutely no intentions on buying a car that day or every leasing a car my life but he did such an amazing job of explaining the numbers and finding a number that worked best for me that I ended up leaving with a car that day. 

I also decided to purchase the window tinting and paint and leather sealant from them as well. If you wait till you get to financing they will ask you if you're interested in it. They originally wanted $299 to tint on my windows but I ended up paying $288 to get my windows tinted and the paint and leather sealant. If you wait till you get to financing you can negotiate the price down!

Throughout the whole experience Emmanuel Rodriquez did an amazing job of listening and not being pushy. At the end of the day he help me get the numbers I was looking for and a new car that I didn't necessarily think I could afford to have. His enthusiasm and upbeat personality helped move along the process. If you're considering buying or leasing a Hyundai I highly recommend you go to Hyundai of Carlsbad and asked for Emmanuel Rodriguez!",4.8,

Got to test drive several cars and salesperson recommended the Tucson that I liked; price was a bit higher than I wanted to pay (because of extra features) but after incentives and trade-in and negotiation, I got it to the price I was hoping for.
So far the only minor issue is that at very slow speeds (<5mph), my 2016 Tucson stutters...I'll be asking about that next time I'm there.",4.8,

8,14-Dec-17,"I began researching cars on Thanksgiving weekend. I was going back and forth on a used car and new car. Finally, my mechanic recommended a new car so I began the search for a quality and affordable sedan. I decided on a 2018 Hyundai Elantra SEL and started shopping for different prices. I submitted an application to get pre-approved for financing on the morning of 12/3 and within 10 minutes, Alex contacted me. He was super friendly and knowledgeable. I went to test drive the car that afternoon and loved it! When we were discussing the price we realized that the website had an error on the discount and they worked to help get the cost as close to the advertised price. They priced it 1000 lower than Kearney so I decided to maintain my purchase at Carlsbad, even though Kearney was closest to me. Alex did not pressure me to add items onto the car and gave me the confidence and assurance that I was purchasing the right car for me. I had taken my boyfriend with me because I had been warned that when women go to the dealership by ourselves they may be taken advantage of - this is also the reason I did extensive research prior to going to any dealership. However, I have no doubt that had I gone on my own I still would have received the same excellent, honest and dignified service from Alex.

54,29-Sep-17,"Great buying experience, I had 10,000 questions and Josh answered all of them.

63,19-Sep-17,I had been to a few dealerships before coming to North Country Hyundai and they surpassed them all. Everyone working there was so friendly and helpful and excited to get me into a vehicle that I loved.

Thank you for your excellence and great attitudes throughout the entire process!,5,

If you are looking for a positive change in your car choice, I would highly recommend stopping by Carlsbad Hyundai and let Aron take care of you!!",5,
95,12-Jul-17,"An absolute great experience. Our salesman Cody was professional, well educated in all aspects of the Elantra, upgrades, and just provided me information. No pressure...he gave me my options and waited patiently for me to decide what was best for me and what I could afford. After reviewing the benefits of some of the options I opted to upgrade one level. I love the backup cam, aluminum rims, hands free calling and radio for a small increase in price. I walked out the door yesterday and almost tried to open my neighbor's BMW as they look alike. Driving this vehicle is a dream, you can't hear anything but your radio, it has awesome power when put in sport mode and a spacious interior. The final perk is two car washes per month. All you have to do is drive up to their service area, give the service man your keys, kick back and drink a free cup of gourmet coffee and they bring your hand washed car back to you. Have work to do bring your laptop and enjoy the free wifi while drinking your coffee. I do not write reviews often but the service at this dealership I received warrants five stars!",5,

104,06-Jul-17,"From internet start to drive-off finish, North County Hyundai performed flawlessly for us.  NCH had a large inventory of the new G80 Sport that we had already thoroughly researched and had decided to be our next Genesis (our 3rd) and they had a vehicle with the exact color combination and features that we wanted.  Our lease was negotiated before ever visiting NCH; Alex Peterson respected our approach to vehicle research and acquisition and worked hard to arrive at the lease terms that we had targeted.  Carrie Mitchell executed the leasing paperwork flawlessly to get us on the road in record time.  This was our first time working with North County Hyundai and we suspect it will not be our last.",5,

114,22-Jun-17,"After local dealer seemed not interested in selling or leasing, I drove to North County Hyundai where the attitude was totally different.  The salesman said their job was to make things work for me.  And they did.  They respected my budgetary restraints (fixed income) and I left in two hours with a new Tucson.  My new payments are actually just under what I expected, and the whole process went very smoothly.  I am a very happy customer",5,
115,20-Jun-17,Shop at North County Hyundai first before going any place else for a new car.  You will find that the sales staff is totally knowledgeable as to their products and most helpful in providing you with the information you need to make an informed decision before you commit to buying.,5,

204,20-Mar-17,"I had done my homework and researched and priced other options before coming. I almost purchased a Toyota and after experiencing the Elantra GT I ended up leasing it that very day.  I was highly recommended to check out Hyundai and see Robert from my friend Jeanelle who  loves her Elantra that she has leased.  I had told my friend Elizabeth and she did some checking and had even called and spoke with Cody.  She even came with me to test drive and see for herself. We were both greeted with smiles and expectation on arrival by Robert and Cody.  She is thinking of considering a Hyundai in the future. Also, my friend Don Klein had recently purchased a Elantra from Carlsbad and loves it. He had given me a  short ride a few months before I even new I was going to be in the market for a car.  I was very impressed and really never had heard of Hyundai before as I was VERY happy with my 15 year old CRV by Honda. You won me over.  Thanks to all.",5,

But when I walked onto Hyundais luck and took a look at the cars I like them, but still wasn't sold until are salesperson Joe greeted us, wasn't pushy, and answered all my questions that I had.

We could not be more pleased!",5,
211,08-Mar-17,"This is the first time that I can truly say that buying a car was not a bad experience.  The staff were all friendly and helpful, and no time did we have to argue about the price.

I truly feel that we received a great deal.",5,
212,03-Mar-17,"The process was amazing because of Alex Peterson.  He is truly a professional, and listened to what my needs were.  Thank you Alex!  The overall experience was wonderful!",5,

231,04-Feb-17,"We had a great buying experience at North County Hyundai.  Everyone we dealt with was courteous, professional, and helpful.  Our sales person, Eric, really knew the car and did a thorough job of explaining the features and how to use them. Using the Costco Buying Program got me a good price without all the haggling.  The buying process/paperwork was quick compared to other experiences I've had. The only negative I have is the sales manager added cost for LoJack and some type of extended service into the final price paperwork for my signature without first asking if I wanted those items.  They were quick to remove them after I noticed them and said I didn't want them.",5,
232,26-Jan-17,"This was the most pleasant car buying experience I have ever had.  They answered the questions I had without trying to talk me into anything I didn't want.

The sales manager met our needs in terms of price which was great.",5,
