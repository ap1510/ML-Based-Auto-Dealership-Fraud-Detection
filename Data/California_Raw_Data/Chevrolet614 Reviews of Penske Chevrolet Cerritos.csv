22,07-Dec-17,"Bought a 2016 Malibu and in less than 18 months, I've had four major issues with the electrical system.  Took it in yesterday due to an issue with the Stable-Track system.  They ""replaced"" two sensors.  Today, the car died on the road and they claimed that the battery (not under warranty) somehow went bad in the 12 hours it was out of the shop.  They tried to get $353 for a new one but ""settled"" for a $100 ""deductible""/ransom

Crooks and liars.  Stay away!!!!",1
153,11-Feb-17,"I went in to get my engine light checked in. After two hours of waiting they tell me the problem my vehicle has and that luckily it's covered by my warranty. I leave my car for a day, come back the following evening to pick up my car. As I leaving the lot, my engine light is still on! I go back and tell the porter and he said they must of forgot to reset it, so there goes my car for another 30mins or so. Later that evening around 11pm, my engine light comes back on.
I went 3 times to this dealer in one week and now they found something else wrong and unfortunately warranty doesn't cover it. Doesn't it really take 3 xxxx times to find that problem!? why couldn't they find that out the first time I brought it in!!! Lazy to do your job complete or what?
On top of that, all those times I never received a call from the dealer about the status of my car. I always called and the person that helped me would never answer. I left about 3 voicemails until I had to leave early to work and drive down there.
Very unprofessional. If it's suppose to be good service, why not call instead of sending a text!
First and last time I ever go here!
Should of gone to Lakewood Chevrolet like I always do!!!",1
179,06-Dec-16,"Car Purchased: 11/10/16 

I called at 9am to let Art know we needed to move our appointment from 11am to 12pm. Art ended the conversation by stating the vehicle would be pulled up front before we arrived so it was ready. We arrived at 12:15pm (after a 2+ hour drive with an infant). The car was not pulled up and the search for the car began. Two or three employees were ""trying to locate the vehicle"". I over heard Art (in a slightly belittling tone) ask the search committee if he needed to go find it himself, because he would find it quickly if he needed to. Looking back now, I wish he would have helped. One hour later the vehicle was finally pulled up. The car battery was dead and it looked like the car had been sitting in a far off corner for months. The car was covered in dirt, cobwebs, hard water stains, etc. Fortunately we had test driven the car at another dealership and we knew what we wanted so we could look past the dirt. But we were embarrassed for the dealership, although it didn't seem to matter to them.

The one good thing, the negotiation and paperwork with Steven went reasonably fast once we said we had to leave. We had a commitment in the afternoon at 2:30, which is why we arrived at 12:15. Since we waited for an hour, Steven helped rush us through the paperwork. We were 30 minutes late to our previously scheduled commitment. As we signed the $10k check and walked away from our $65k purchase, we were assured the vehicle would receive a ""full detail"" and be delivered the following day. 

Christian - the ""sales guy"" - was really nice. Didn't interact with him much, but he answered our questions and seemed the most attentive. He was great going over the features of the car upon delivery.

At 1pm the following day we decided to contact the dealership about the delivery time because no one had called us with an update. We were told the vehicle was ready, was leaving the lot shortly, and would arrive in one hour. Two and half hours later the vehicle arrived. Apparently when this dealership performs a ""full-detail"", it means a wipe down with a dust cloth. There was dirt all over the car, the paint they use to write numbers on the windshield was still on the glass, the tires still had chalk/paint markings on them, and there were numerous spots inside the vehicle that were left dirty. It's quite shocking actually. 

I suppose our standards have been set too high having dealt with Lexus and Infiniti dealerships in the past, but we really only seemed to matter from the time we agreed to a price to the time we walk off the lot. We live 2+ hours from the dealership, so we'll obviously never go back, but even if we lived across the street, I'd have a hard time revisiting this dealership. 

Steven did offer to detail the car if we brought it back, which is an easy offer when he know's we live 2+ hours away. The better offer would have been to contact a partnering dealership near our home town and arrange to have the car detailed at Penske's expense. 

Overall, we had a pretty rough and underwhelming experience with Penske. Doesn't feel good to leave disappointed after you just spent $65k. At least we love the car.

*****UPDATE #1*****11/29/16:

Penske has contacted me in an effort to improve my experience, and I appreciate their effort. I respect the effort they made to provide detailing services and letters acknowledging their missteps. They recovered well.

*****UPDATE #2*****12/05/16:

We were fooled. We were contacted by Sabrina at Penske, and she offered to reimburse the cost of detailing up to $200 (we live 2 hours from dealer, so they said have it done locally and they will reimburse). We had the car detailed and sent the invoice. We received a call on 12/05/16 from Harout who shared that they were no longer going to reimburse us for the detailing because of the review we gave them. It's fairly evident the poor services trickles down from the top, which is unfortunate for the good guys like our salesmen Christian, who was great, but he is being lead by poor managers. Multiple times, and multiple employees at Penske, we were asked to give a review of our experience, so we did. And our experience was not good. Penske attempted to recover, but they failed again to provide a great experience because they were unhappy with our review. They must cover up a lot of bad experiences and reviews by attempting to intimidate you in to giving a good review. And clearly they have a cooperate office monitoring their reviews, so I look forward to continuing to share how poorly managed our experience was.",1
202,29-Sep-16,"This place is awful! They charged me $125 just to blow smoke thru my emissions system then quoted me $900 or possibly more for a repair I had done for $200 elsewhere. Came back for a recal issue, the appointment scheduler had me come in at 7 AM and it's now 915am they haven't even started working on my rig and I got up at 5 am for no reason! NEVER coming here again!",1
414,15-Aug-15,"I was told after 7 days of my truck being in their shop that the noise I heard was standard wear and tear, my truck broke down two days later with broken leaf springs, needless to say this dealership is now under investigation by General Motors for negligence and safety. Oh did I mention it's a 2014 Silverado with 9k miles ""standard wear a tear"" good luck with that see you court",1

455,13-Jun-13,"I bought a new Cruze from this dealer, which was by the way a pleasant experience. But after 3 weeks I noticed my car makes strange noise, so I called them and set up an appointment, with their manager Micheal Carter. When I drove there on time, Micheal wasn't there. A girl called him and apparently he couldn't come, and she told me anyone at the service office can help me. I ended up ""helped"" by a young man whose name I didn't even get. I showed him the noise from my car, he listened for 1 second and told me that's normal, all Cruzes make that noise. Obviously not! I drove another Cruze before, which was perfectly fine. Then he changed his words and told me different Cruze makes different noise, but still the noise from my car is normal. He didn't even bother to open the hood and check where the noise was coming from. He saw me not satisfied and said ""Your car is completely normal, OK!"" and went back to his office, leaving me out there! All he was trying to do is to get rid of me.

CHERISH LIFE, STAY AWAY FROM THEIR SERVICE OFFICE!",1
472,29-Aug-12,"I went in to buy a brand new Camaro, everything went well...and drove her home that day.  Two days later, I get a call from finance saying that the financing fell through.  They wanted more cash from me and said that my interest rate was going to increase.  If I did not agree to these terms, they were going to take the car back from me.  Freaked out, I start looking for help.  I decided to post on Camaro fan forums, figured the guys on there would be experienced car buyers and know the pricing of a Camaro.  Come to find out, not only am I involved in whats called a spot delivery scam, I over paid for the car by a landslide.  Jilma in finance, told me that I was paying hundreds under factory invoice and 29,650 was a steal for a BASE 1LT (only option added: automatic transmission).  The finance director Omar, kills me kindness on the phone and talks to me like I'm an idiot.  I am told,  what I'm going through happens a lot at sleazy dealerships.  If I were you, I would take your business elsewhere...there are plenty of dealerships around

I am now being advised to seek legal council and contact the consumer protection agency.",1
473,13-Aug-12,"The vehicle was driven in for a ABS light and Passenger side Diff gasket leak. The vehicle was towed out with the entire front diff in the trunk and a damaged wheel brake line and other components.  The Adviser never calls back, performs work without authorization and when you call him, he has a don't bother me attitude on the phone.  when the manager was contacted he states its not his problem.........i really do not recommend this dealer, the other advisers seem really sharp, i noticed well sitting for hours in the service drive. they call customers and explein in depth whats going on. so i am sure they have some great employees there, i just got mixed up with the bad bunch. ",1
612,11-Nov-10,"I did all of my research for our new Traverse online, so as to ensure the most competitive pricing.  Many of the dealers kept forcefully encouraging me to come in before they would negotiate.  Edwin, on the other hand, was always open to hearing the lowest bid I had received and able to beat it!  We were on a time crunch to buy the vehicle and, though he was out sick for the day, he still came in to the dealership late at night to meet us and close the deal.  GREAT experience and I would definitely recommend going to see Edwin if you are in the market for a new car.",1
276,22-Apr-16,"Worst experience with a service center. Done regular maintenance in warranty they took 4hrs to do, and haven't done multi point inspection.

452,06-Aug-13,"We bought our first truck here, and went back wanting to trade in our truck for a Tahoe. I was very disappointed with the customer service given. Thomas never gave us a call back when he said he would. He didn't show any interest in working with us or helping us get into another vehicle. They also offered us $7,000 lower than George Chevrolet for our trade in. Thomas said he would try to get us a better deal, but never called back.",1.2

195,16-Oct-16,"5 1/2 hours for an oil change with an appointment. Car came back unwashed, as well. We asked for estimates multiple times, and barely received them 5 1/2 hours later. One of the estimates was not even for the correct part. Poor customer service. Representatives don't care if you're satisfied. Two other equally dissatisfied customers while we were there.",1.4
0,07-Jan-20,"Sold me a car in 2017 and never informed me it had been crashed before I bought it. I called Reed in October of 2019 to inform him I found out it was crashed because the dealer I tried selling it to said they didnt' want it because of an accident in July of 2017. I bought it a month later. This means someone they lent the car out to crashed it. He said to bring it down and he'd buy it, but before doing that in December of 2019, I went online to get an estimate. I included the crash to see if some other dealer would at least give me $9,000. One was close, they offered me 8,000 and convinced me to bring it in to get more. They said no because of the accident and informed me that I could've received $9500. I went back to Penske, Reed was not there. I figured I'd see what they offer now and see how different the amount is compared to what Reed said he'd offer. They only wanted to give me $5,500. I had just been offered 8,000 from an entirely different dealer, and these sales people said it's only wroth 5500. They didn't care that I was not told it was crashed previously. They said to wait for Reed. I did for 2 hours. He never showed. I left my number. He never called. I called several times after that, he never called. I called again the next day, he never called. I emailed him twice, he never emailed. Horrible customer service there and on yelp one can see I'm not the only one dissatisfied with this dealership",1.5
357,10-Dec-15,"After my lukewarm review on Yelp due to Adam West's unctuous used car salesman tactics, I was offered an extra key for the vehicle I purchased from Penske as follows: ""If you can let me earn a chance to redeem this experience for you. We'd love to provide you with a complimentary key seeing as how the vehicle didn't have the extra hub, free of cost, Thanks again for the feedback so that we may progress, but we'd love to help improve your point of view and hope to recieve a positve experience rating if obtainable."" 

When I made multiple attempts via email and telephone to schedule picking up a new key, no one ever responded. I finally went back to the dealership yesterday to see why they had not responded to my multiple attempts to contact them and was told that the point of offering me a new key was so I would take my lukewarm review down although these terms were never explained in the original email. 

Shame on the management for failing to keep their word as expressed in their email. A positive review would have been obtainable if the dealership had kept their word.",1.6
39,15-Nov-17,"We purchased a brand new 2017 Chevy truck for $56,000 from Penske Chevrolet in Cerritos, CA on November 14, 2017.  The vehicle had 30 miles on it when we took delivery.

Upon final delivery, the salesman didn't walk us around the outside of the vehicle to make sure everything on the outside was ok, he only concentrated on the interior features. The next morning, we discovered a couple of chips in the paint, numerous scratches on the bed, and a screw in the right rear tire.

We went back to the dealership the next morning, November 15, 2017, to show them the damage.  The Sales Manager, Rey Gonzalez, moaned and groaned about the damage and said he'd have to talk to our salesman who won't be back for a couple of days.  He gave us a Due Bill to fix the scratches but wouldn't honor that until he could speak to our sales person.

Mr. Gonzalez flat out refused to fix the screw in the tire saying it could have been something we did, which is true.

What I want prospective customers of Penske Chevrolet in Cerritos to be aware of is that they treated us nicely before the sale was finalized and treated us very poorly the following day.

They could have easily repaired the tire.  After all, they delivered the truck with 30 miles already on it and the tire could have  picked up the screw during those 30 miles.  Instead Mr. Gonzalez completely refused to fix the tire for us, instantly souring our opinion of Penske Chevrolet of Cerritos.  Is that any way to treat a customer that spent $56,000.00 at your business the previous day?  What is wrong with people?

I don't know how smart you have to be to hold the title of Sales Manager at a car dealership but I do know that Penske Chevrolet of Cerritos spends a lot of money on advertising to bring new customers to their dealership.

If all it cost was $20 to repair a tire in order to make a new customer who just spent $56,000 feel well taken care of and appreciated, or even cared about at all, knowing they would likely refer their friends and family to the dealership, then that would be money well spent.

Instead, Mr. Rey Gonzalez has left us not only disliking him, but also disliking the company he represents, Penske Chevrolet of Cerritos.  Perhaps the Penske Automotive Group should send Mr. Gonzalez back to Sales Manager school with a emphasis on good customer relations because we won't buy from Penske Chevrolet of Cerritos again and we certainly won't recommend our friends or family shop there either.  All because Rey Gonzalez, Sales Manager at Penske Chevrolet of Cerritos was too much of a cheap skate to fix a screw in a tire.",1.8
447,14-Nov-13,"I attempted to purchase a certified used Avalanche. The salesman's position on wanting to make a deal with me that day was that it was a slow day and they had not made their quota for the day. We agreed on a price and prepared the paperwork. I could not take the car that night, we prepared the paper work with the finance department and I put a down payment on a credit card. We came back to the dealer a couple days later to finish the paperwork and pay for the car.We wrote a check for the entire amount less the credit card payment and the finance department told us they could take a company check event though they knew a company check was going to be used.  I truly believe I gave them every opportunity for them to sell me the car with the goal of providing customer service. In the end I was not able to purchase the car and ultimately had them refund the credit card charge they had on the car to hold it.  I was never informed or called during this process to have me understand the policies that they have in purchasing cars. Whenever I talked to somebody the story changed and I felt very confused, frustrated and dismayed.  At the end of this process, one of the floor sales managers told me their policy is they cannot take company checks, personnel checks or money orders. If that is their policy, I do not know how you can purchase a car from them without having a car to trade in and/or financing the entire amount? It appears that customer service is not a part of how they want to do business. Companies like this may be in business in the short term but in the long term, they will put themselves out of business, 
BE VERY CAREFUL IN DEALING WITH THEM AS THEY DO NOT COMMUNICATE WITH THE CUSTOMERS AND ALSO AMONGST THEMSELEVES",1.8
467,24-Feb-13,"My mom and I visited this dealership on Saturday, 23 Feb looking for a 2013 Traverse.  The dealer had only 2012 models and indicated that they would be able to find one in given the large inventory owned by Penske.  After talking with some additional salesmen, a search was done and they were unable (I believe) to find a model that matched the vehicle we were looking for.  The sales manager asked if we would mind coming back during the week when the had more time to help us.  I suggested that Sunday would be better.  They took my name an number and I have not heard from them yet (It's Sunday 8:30pm now).  I continued my search online about 2:30pm on Saturday - found a match at Selman Chevrolet in Orange.  I spoke with the sales staff at Selman and they did not have the exact model we were looking for but they found one in Fontana, had it delivered and that night we bought a Traverse from Selman Chevrolet in Orange.  I was very dissatisfied with the team at Penske, they were more interested in trying to talk us into helping them clear their inventory rather than finding us the car we wanted.",2

450,22-Aug-13,"I am in the market for a new car a hybrid test drove the Volt and I think something called the Spark. Nice cars but they just are overpriced on their cars. told the sales person what i am willing to pay monthly and what i was looking for so he shows me a top of the line volt then tries to say i am willing to put 4,000 down when i am only willing to put down my trade vehicle. after each test drive he nervously asked if i was willing to talk to his manager who of course this well dressed man in a suit asking if there was anyway he could earn my business today. I said No said i had to bring the wife down to test the cars also. and i might do that on the Weekend I have no intentions of ever walking back on that lot. and the reason is i have a Car already on order with another dealer in the area.",2.3
1,17-Sep-19,On 9/10 I went to Penske Chevrolet of Cerritos and bought a certified pre-owned 2015 Camaro RS at what I considered a great price. I never test drove it on the freeway and as I was driving back to WLA I realized the engine noise is way to loud at freeway speed. My wife confirmed it the next morning when I started it up and it rattled the whole house. I realized I made a mistake and went back to the dealer the next afternoon. Apparently with certified pre-owned cars you can trade within 3 days or 150 miles for another certified car or a new one you cannot get a refund. I  cannot afford to spend 35k plus for new and this dealer has maybe 6 pre-cars so I made the only choice that made sense and had to pay 5k more for a 2016 Chevy Colorado truck. I couldn't make a good deal  because I had no leverage.  Compared to  Chevy Colorado  certified trucks from other dealers on the internet which were priced lower and had more amenities I was over charged. My only choice was a WT model which stands for work truck. It came with scratches inside the bed which was very dirty upon delivery. The carpet in the back seat was worn away to the base in one spot. I was was only given one key and remote instead of two which is the norm. This truck only has 18k miles and the rest of it was clean. How could this truck be considered Certified? One thing I will say my sales woman Leah Sneed was wonderful and did the best she could under the xxxxty circumstances. 25k for a work truck. I was ripped off. Penske Chevrolet you owe me at least $1500 to make it right,2.5
79,21-Aug-17,Saw an ad for an Impala on line at this dealership & contacted dealer. They wanted me to come down that day but was more concerned regarding the finance numbers. Was told the next day the car wasn't available for sale just yet as it needed to be inspected & reconditioned. So like why are you advertising a car you can't sell? I got strung along for a week; it would have been OK if the car was sold but it wouldn't pass inspection on the same day it had a $500 price drop. Beware of this dealerships deceptive and false advertising policies!!,2.6
456,30-May-13,"Hopefully i have more room to write here than in the space they give for their survey. I bought my 2013 camaro from here, everything great im excited. When they washed the car to give to me they put a dent on it. Not a big deal they promised they would fix it. I bought my car on friday and by monday i got a call to schedule my car to repair the dent. I was at work so I called as soon as i get out. No call back for a couple of days so i called back. Three weeks and four calls later i reached out to my sales rep for help. She was able to get me an appointment. I wanted to upgrade the exhaust so they scheduled their vendor to meet me the day i dropped of my car. I drop off my car at 730 and im supposed to meet with their vendor at 8am. The vendor never shows just wasted my time. Already frustrated one of the service guy comes up to me to let me know my car is ready. I go outside and its not even my car. A second guy comes out to tell me my car is in the back they are just drying it. So i wait and the first guy comes back to let me know my car is still in the back untouched and if I want to wait 15 minutes they can wash it for me. Told them forget it i just want my car and to get out of there. I let them know what happened. To make up for the inconvenience they say they will give me the upgrades I wanted at cost. I thought that was a great deal so i figured give them one more shot. I get the price quote and it seemed high for "" cost"" so I did some research. They actually were charging me more than what the dealer was promoting on their webpage. So to make up for all their mistakes they wanted to charge me more for my upgrades. Horrible follow up and then the final insult. Would never recommend them to anyone.",2.6
442,11-Aug-14,"I traveled over 2 hours to look at a ""Certified"" vehicle. The car was very nice, except it had a few flaws. The a/c did not work, one set of tail lights did not work, and the retractable top did not work as smoothly as it should. I was told by the Sales manager that I could take the car and bring it back. I was hoping that my satisfaction in buying a ""Certified"" vehicle would be important to him. It was not. I was very unhappy to have driven over 2 hours to look at a car that was supposed to be ""Certified"". I was ready to purchase the car because it was a good price. But I don't believe that customer satisfaction was the rule for the day. Leah Sneed was great, I think if she were able to she would have done what was needed to make me happy. I left very disappointed. It is too bad that Leah Sneed lost a sale because those around her who have the responsibility to do their job correctly fell short. I would not be surprised that the mechanic who signed off on the ""Certified"" vehicle probably did not even look at the car. I am glad that I left and did not buy the car because as it is I found another car at another dealer that I did buy because they wanted me to be truly satisfied. I will not recommend or even consider Penske Chevrolet not now or in the future!",2.8
256,28-May-16,"First, let me say that I am normally more than happy with my vehicle's service needs at Penske Chevrolet.  And, while my service and repairs are always top notch, this time the repairs took far too long for a process that the vehicle itself normally completes without outside help. I arrived at the service department at 7:22am with Stephen Serrano as my service advisor.  I explained that my 2014 Cruze Turbo Diesel needed routine oil service and the night before that the ""check engine"" light came on as well as the DIC indicating ""reduced engine power"" which followed a brief message indicating ""diesel particulate filter is full, continue driving.""  I could tell by the look on his face that he had no idea what I was talking about, thus he was probably not at all familiar with the Diesel engine.  Stephen explained that the mechanic would have to determine the fault codes, etc., but the car should be ready in ""a couple hours.""  That seemed reasonable since I was really only having an oil service completed because the regenerating of the diesel particulate filter simply requires the engine running at high RPMs for about 30 minutes.  I head home using the Penske shuttle, but I don't learn that my car is ready after two hours... Instead, it is ready after 8.75 hours. So, while my car is once again running perfectly, I don't quite understand why it took nearly nine hours to get it that way",3.4

So I went to the dealership.At the end of the day I was told the deal was good and I left with a 2014 silverado.

Why tell me all is good congrats and all that than say oh by the way banks said no after all.I'm passed but taking it to a lawyer would be a waste of time.

Took three calls to finally be told  to come down but that was only to get second key ordered and to order manuals for the Equinox.

The salesperson Michael Hurst was very reassuring and I felt confident putting my utmost trust in his expertise and good word in their vehicles at Penske Chevrolet. He also provided me with the Car Fax report to further put me at ease about the vehicle. The credit application was simple and fast and I was very pleased that they were able to get me the best price possible to meet my budget needs. I feel very happy with my selection and would most definitely recommend this dealership to my friends seeking quality cars at affordable prices with high end dealership service.

Thank you Penske Chevrolet!,4
121,21-May-17,"Took the car in for an oil change and tires. The service writer was quite helpful, including helping me use the best of several coupons available. The work was performed promptly and on the promised schedule. 

That said, every dealer I ever go to does a cursory inspection of things like fluid levels, wiper blades, signal and marker lights, etc. - it's good business, as they can sell you something else you actually need. When I went in, I had a low tire pressure message on. Unfortunately, it was a text warning, and it turns out this was obscuring a warning to check both the left and right rear turn signal bulbs. After leaving the dealer, 2 blocks later, as I made my first turn, I got one turn signal warning. 2 blocks later, I got the other one. Both of these things should be inspected any time a car is in for service. I had somewhere to be, so I will either have to return to the dealer later, or more likely, have to replace them myself.",4.2

He knows his product very well and would research any unknown answers. Straight forward with no BS. I like it! Mike has even called me to follow up on my new truck. Making sure there are no issues. I can't say the same about the other sales personel. My wife and I were walking around for about 15-20min trying to find help. I understand the other THREE sales reps on the lot were helping other customers. At the same time we were pretty much ignored. Not once did anyone offer to help or get us help. Hello, sales 101 considering we were looking at one of your most expensive trucks on the lot. We had to walk back to the front office to receive help. At this time we met Mike where he was finishing up a current sale. I will say that we were moments from walking out had it not been for Mike. A manger helped Mike with his final sale so that he may help us. The rating of three on customer service is based of my initial experience not Michael Hurst.",4.4

133,02-Apr-17,"This was the fourth Chevy dealership I had visited in 3 days. Two of which did not seem to care about doing business, and the other two , one of which was Penske, worked hard for my business. Osibaldo Barajas took what I felt was an impossible financial situation , and made it possible.
Several things were not right, but we worked through them, and solved each situation over several days.  ( the vehicle needed a second key. It did not have a manual. There was a very shallow ,large dent in the passenger door, which was not visible unless it was caught at a specific angle.) All of these problems were and will be taken care of.
Thanks Penske and thanks Ossie for your continued service and attention over the past two weeks.

He told us the directions to get to the GMC and if we wanted a Chevy, he could do his best to get us the price we want for our Chevy. So we stayed and in the end we bought a new CHEVY 2011 SILVERADO, because of his professionalism. We definitely recommend this dealership and his great salemanship!",4.8
587,18-May-11,"Thomas is the nice's salesperson I have ever worked with.
When the car that I wanted was in the process of being sold by another salesperson, Thomas quickly went on the computer to find another car anywhere. He found one being shipped without a customer.  He quickly grabbed and put my name on the VIN number.
I live in Las Vegas and would have a problem coming back to Cerritos to get the car.
Thomas said, ""No Problem, I will drive it to vegas for you"". His idea sounded great to me as I would have to drive it to Vegas to get it home any way. A very nice jesture.

Since bying the Volt, Thomas has either emailed or phoned almost daily giving me related information that would make life at the wheel a little easier driving my 2011 VOLT.                          Thanks Dan  ",4.8
609,12-Nov-10,"My wife and I were in search of a bigger car/suv because of our expanding family.  I called Penske Cheverolet and immediately Edwin picked up the phone.  He was a straight shooter and was very professional on the phone.  After conversing with him and discussing what I wanted (2011 Chevy Tahoe), I set an appointment to see him the next day, I just felt it in my guts to go to Penske... for the ultimate service and value.   Upon arrival there was a warm friendly greeting by Edwin.  He showed me the Tahoe I wanted... looked stunning!  Throughout the sales process, Edwin and the whole Penske Team was very professional and helpful, doing whatever necessary to make sure the ""experience"" was excellent.  I even had a trade in and they gave me max $$.... very impressed!!

Thank you Edwin and Penske Team for helping my family and I get into our dream SUV.... we are all happy!!!

Thank you!!!

4,17-Apr-19,Great service overall. Customer Service @ it’s best. I needed work done on my 2019 suburban which was going to take more than 7 hours took the shuttle service to the mall.  Everyone was so helpful and nice. One thing the dealership might want to invest in for customers waiting for their vehicle is completely coffee. Every car I have owned I get my oil change @ the dealer and every other dealer has completely Starbucks coffee machine. that would be nice. ,5

12,22-Dec-17,"Penske Chevrolet of Cerritos was having a year end special on 2017 Impalas, so my wife and I started to drive there from Thousand Oaks with an arrival time of about 6:30pm on a Saturday night.  Decided to call ahead.  Asked for Mark Wagner (had read some good Yelp reviews).  He took my call and I let him know what my interest was in their inventory (3 Premier 2017 Impalas).  Even though he was getting off from work after a full day; Mark canceled his dinner plans, retrieved all three cars (having them cleaned) and parked them together so that we arrived, I could compare/contrast between the three.  Mark was extremely pleasant, exceptionally easy to talk with about the different options between cars.  He was amazingly knowledgeable about the vehicles. 
We went for a test drive in the car of my choice.  On to price negotiation.  It was so quick and easy!  The best part was that Mark was able to achieve my target price without a ""sales manager"" taking over.  Once the price was agreed upon, Kimberly Amaya was ready for us in finance.  This was also a very pleasing experience.  She presented all of her information pleasantly and professionally.  Once the paperwork was processed, Mark Wagner was waiting for us to review the car operation (mostly OnStar) as well as show me the controls and technology.  Because it was a Saturday night, there wasn't anyone to truly detail the car.  Without any problem, Mark was able to get approval for me to get a detail at my own car wash in Thousand Oaks and submit the receipt for reimbursement.  This was also above and beyond what I have experienced with prior dealerships.  The car was mine at 9:30PM.  Only 3 hours from beginning to end; the fastest time ever in purchasing a new car.  No BS,  this was the very best experience ever with a dealership!  I am 57 and have bought new cars for myself and family for 30 years.  I highly recommend that you request Mark Wagner for your sales representative.  You will not be disappointed.  I know that there was a manager behind Mark whom, unfortunately I did not meet, but I thank them as well for the ease of negotiation and for allowing me the extra detail at my preferred car wash.  Overall, I rate Penske Chevrolet of Cerritos an 11 out of 10.  What a great experience.  Thank you Mark and Kim!",5
13,21-Dec-17,"Leah Sneed was my sales person. Very thorough and very helpful, you gotta see her when looking for a vehicle. She helped us, and she can help you as well.",5
14,17-Dec-17,"Bill Rogers was my sales professional. He was very thorough and explained all questions I had about the car I was wanting and how the process would go forward.  Bill was easy to talk to and there was never a time that I felt pressured by him or any of the other employees at Penske Chevrolet. In summary, doing business with Bill and also Scott in the finance dept. was outstanding.  I would not hesitate recommending Bill and Penske Chevrolet of Cerritos to my friends and family.` The only issue I had with buying the car was on vehicle delivery.  Not sure where or how the vehicles are stored prior to sale but this car was very dirty especially under the hood. There were a large number of large spider webs all throughout the engine compartment and cowling. The area was also extremely dusty and a little grimy for a car with only 5 miles on the odometer.  The interior was also dustier than it should have been.  Service did wash the car and it had a full tank of gas when it was delivered to me.  One more point I'd like to make regarding the delivery process is that Bill did an excellent job of explaining how things worked on the car and all of the safety issues.  ",5
15,15-Dec-17,"Bussey Ellis, the sale rep, actually called me as soon as they received the car I was looking for.  My wife and I went to Penske Chevrolet, and within a short period of time, we were the owners of a brand new Chevrolet Bolt.  Good job!",5

Once he got word that the paperwork was ready he brought in Kim Amaya, Finance, and she brought me to her office where all the paperwork was ready to go.

It doesn't have to be like that and it's not at Penske Chevrolet. 
After going to all the different manufacturers like Toyota, Dodge and GMC My mind was made up and I wanted a Chevrolet. 
I went to my local Chevrolet dealer and looked at and got a price then went home and did my homework online. I called Penske and talked to Raul Ortega we talked numbers on the phone and then I drove to the dealership. When I got there I asked him to have someone check out and have a price ready for my trade in while we looked at the 3 trucks that I was looking at online. After settling on one we went inside and he ran the numbers, we were close but I wanted the night to think about it. There was absolutely no pressure from Raul and I called the next day and got a number that worked for both of us and said yes. I told Raul that I was on my way and to have the paperwork ready so I did not have to wait around, he said that he would do his best and when I got to the dealership I filled out 1 application waited for 15 minutes then went right into financing.
In financing, I worked with Lesly who also is very professional she had me out of there in 45 minutes and answered every question I had. This my friends is the place to go for your best deal and to work with the best in the business! ",5
131,04-Apr-17,"What an incredible experience!  I don't know why I would purchase another car from anyone other than Penske of Cerritos!  Roger Penske has out done himself with his service, level of quality team and overall election and price.  Raul Ortega, created the easiest experience.  We discussed option on the phone, came down to look at inventory and in 20 minutes after test drive was signing documents to drive home in a brand new Volt!  Details from how to the features to using On Star, to how to maximize the mileage and best was how to use Sport mode!  He made sure phones were paired up and that we could use the My Chevy App before driving away.  Best was his follow-up to offer assistance with the rebate program.  I didn't think I would buy a Chevy but after dealing with the Penske team, I'll drive to these dealerships to buy all my cars!  Thank you for making me feel special and I encourage everyone to shop around the Penske dealership at Cerritos before you sign any contract!  Well worth the short time and minimal drive to see!  ",5

He even called and texted me to status of my vehicle even when he was off work hours.  That's service!!

The next day I called Walter and told him what I wanted, he looked over his stock and told me he had what I was looking for,we met Walter that evening and he showed us the truck and we took it for a test drive. The next step was the paperwork and I do want to say that at no time during the whole experience  was there any pressure from Walter or the finance people which made it quick and easy. A few days after the purchase Walter called me and asked how I liked my truck,and he wanted to know if I had any issues or concerns with my new truck.

Reason, she worked with me on the purchase of my new 2011 Camaro. You could not asked for a more professional and friendly employee as Shazette (Lea). What a great experience. She is completely knowledgeable about all products and options. This new buy was a new 2016 Tahoe and I could not be more satisfied, and satisfied doesn't even do it justice, it is beyond that.

If future buyers read this, I would HIGHLY recommend Penske of Cerritos and to make your buying experience a pleasure, ask for Shazette (Lea). I am sure you will enjoy your buying experience with her, I have, twice.

233,15-Jul-16,"Car salespeople have a long known bad reputation in society but Martin Cortez broke down that feeling.  I originally called into the dealership already knowing everything about the truck I wanted and exactly where each available one was. So a price and no pressure was what I wanted.  Just help me to make my selection, don't try to sell me.  I'm already buying.  The question is now from who?

This is where Martin Cortez excelled.  He did what he said he would in a timely manner.  Never tried to upsell.  Just as simple as returning a phone call, getting the correct answer to a question, admitting certain information was not correct, and being a person who just wants to help me purchase a vehicle. Preferably from him.

Great job Martin.",5

288,24-Mar-16,"From the moment I walked onto the lot and into the dealership, I felt appreciated, and comfortable.  I've been to many dealerships and as well been in sales for many years, I've never seen a better run establishment. The staff all gets along with one another. From the janitor to the owner, all staff Works together like family. A salesman by the name of CHRIS GARCES, helped me purchace a new car. He also had help with a saleswoman named Shea _______. What I really liked about CHRIS GARCES, is that he never once pushed me, made me, or intimidate me in anyway while he was helping me get approved.  No matter what issues were brought upon his sale, he handled it with a smile and with class.  I've been in sales many years, I know first hand how difficult it is to deal with customers and problems getting the sale to finalize. He and SHEA, never once broke that smile or put on a fake smile.  Never once did they act as if the sale was important to them or that it was not a big deal to them. Instead, CHRIS & SHEA made me feel like I was important wether the sale happens or not.  Made me feel like they were gonna do all they could to HELP ME, NOT HELP THEMSELVES. As hard as it is to trust people these days, I immediately felt comfortable and felt that I could trust him & her.  I was there from 11:30am to 6:40pm.  CHRIS & SHEA did everything they could to get me approved and into the car I wanted.    After sale was made I had been there a long time. Then they sent me to finance where a man by the name of LARRY, ""HELLO"".  Was excellent. I mentioned to Larry that I haven't ate all day and been at the dealership all day and asked him if he could wrap this paperwork up, well MR LARRY, made my night.  He hurried as fast as he could. I was really impressed with this dealership before I met LARRY, But after it was all said and done, I was now super impressed with the dealership.   From the first salesman to the last, there was no time where I said anything negative to myself or was wanting to pull my hair out. I was hungry, tired, restless, and yet, the staff was so awesome, that it made this the best experience buying a vehicle.  Thanks to all who helped me to get into my new MALIBU 2016.  HELLO! ",5
289,22-Mar-16,"Although we started off with a rocky relationship due to problems with the new vehicle I purchased back in 2014, staff at Penske Chevrolet Cerritos did everything possible to resolve the problems and make me a happy camper--which they did--admirably.  When I take my car in for annual inspections, the service department greets me with friendly faces and offers of assistance.  Yesterday, it was David Canche who greeted me, asked the reason for my visit, and completed the paperwork.  He also let me know when the work was done.  At other dealerships, you wait for someone to approach you, then send you in to see a service representative.  They may or may not be the one to follow up with you on status of your vehicle.

But Faith Fujita and Inez Moreno greeted me with pleasant smiles and made feel comfortable right away. My car was serviced right away in a timely fashion, and did not consume my day.

I first spoke to Eddie Rosas which was really friendly and answered many of my questions efficiently. As I was ready to purchase he introduced me to Jesus Lara which was helpful enough to reassure me I was getting a car that fitted my needs. Mr. Lara was friendly and found ever way to keep me satisfied.  ",5
440,19-Dec-14,"Miguel Conrique Of the service department was pretty sessional and efficient.
He deduced right away that my turbo had failed and got me set up with a rental car at no additional charge since he had to order the part.
He kept me updated with the cars repair progress and at no point in time did I feel worried.",5
443,15-Jul-14,"They arent afraid to give a very low price. They had a car listed online at basically trade in value, low enough to make me concerned it was a bait and switch, but luckily this was not the case. 

Was a very hassle free experience, they werent overly pushy on all the extras at all which was nice. 

The whole process took a bit longer than I had hoped, but they were really busy. Everyone was very friendly and professional. 

Anyways, good dealer that in least in my case was willing to sell really low. 

Highly recommend this dealer",5

448,27-Aug-13,"This was not the first dealership I went to. I had gone to a few prior to coming to Penske Chevy at Cerritos & all I can say is the customer service was a whole lot better! Jesus Lara was my sales representative and I'm glad he was. Jesus knew the answers to all the questions I had, unlike other representatives at other dealerships. He made me feel comfortable and didn't pressure me into getting a car I didn't want. I walked in there with my mind set on a Chevy Cruze & that's exactly what I walked out with. I'm very happy with my purchase & the deal i got. I highly recommend this dealership! Ask for Jesus Lara!!!",5

He took the time and showed my both models, explained the different features and then took me on a test drive. He made sure that I was comfortable with the car and how it handled and explained all of my options for purchasing the car. I love the car! I can call the dealership and they answer my questions and helped me into a New Car. I never thought I could afford a new car, i thought i could only afford a used car. Thank You Aaron!",5

463,22-Mar-13,"I was in the market to purchase a new Tahoe and contacted the Internet department at Cerritos Chevrolet via CarWoo.  I contacted by Cynthia ""CJ"" Jefferson and right from the beginning I knew that she was going to work hard to get the best possible deal for me.  She was very up-front about the pricing and immediately showed me the invoice price on the vehicle and discussed how much she was going to go below the invoice without any negotiating.  On top of that, we found additional Chevrolet incentives that I was eligible for and she quoted me a price online before even having to go to the dealership.  This was a big plus as Cerritos Chevrolet is 30 miles away from my house.  After doing additional pricing at other local dealers, I realized that this was the best price and they had multiple vehicles to choose from on the lot so I got to choose the color I wanted.  Now this is how shopping for a vehicle online is suppose to be, quick, easy, no-hassle and no pressure.  If you are looking to buy a new Chevy, I highly recommend that you visit Cerritos Chevrolet and ask for CJ in the Internet department.",5
464,18-Mar-13,Great customer service. Sales employees are not pushy like they are at some other dealerships. They listen and offer advise when/if needed. Knowledgable about their vehicles. Very willing to help with finances and getting the car you want not the car you'll settle for. Very friendly and helpful with anything you need. Very fair with trade-ins. Would definitely return to this dealer for anything extra needed for my car. Would definitely recommend this dealer to friends and family.

Next time I am in the market for a new car,  Penske will be my first and only stop! :)  Thank you CJ, you rock! :D  I'm in love with my new sexy Camaro!! ",5
466,11-Mar-13,"I was extremely impressed with the customer service. They quickly found the car I wanted. I didn't have to argue or try to beat down the price. Everyone there worked together to help me to feel comfortable. It was great to walk in, pick the car. I gave them my information and left. I had to go to a birthday party and said I would be back at 5 pm. Due to bad traffic I didn't get back until 7 pm. Arturo and Nidal Hussein had waited for me long after they should have been home with their families. It was so wonderful to come in  7 hours late and not to be passed off to someone else to finish the deal. Arturo was very kind to my husband who can be hard to deal with when it comes to money. We got an excellent deal. We had gone to other dealers who refused to give us the deal we wanted, but Arturo just said  yes to what we wanted within 5 minutes of our arrival.",5

I am very picky with everything in my life, so I told him I didn't like the windshield because it has a slight chip and if they would replace it.  As I looked around I could get a basic newer car for one-thousand less.  The car Chris showed me was fully loaded for one-thousand more in price, a year older, and about 10,000 more miles.  I am into the way something looks and for a thousand more I feel I have received a great deal.  My doctor even has this same car, but a 2006 and has never had problems at all with his HHR.  I am so happy with my car and with all aspects of service at Penske Chevrolet of Cerritos.  Chris Sanchez went out of his way to help me get this car, even when he was off work, he set his family aside to serve my needs.

500,22-Mar-12,"Best car purchase experience I ever had. My dad purchased a truck from Thomas about a year ago and is still very satisfied.  Thomas made sure I was happy and went above and beyond to ensure I was well taken care of and I am satisfied...plus I was not in the dealership all night.  I'm pretty sure I was in and out in less than two hours.  If i ever need another car or one of my friends or family needs a car, I'm sending them to Thomas.  He is the best.  I doubt I will need another one anytime soon. She is beautiful powerful, and I've called het Isabel....Izzy for short.  :)",5

502,19-Mar-12,"My husband and I had been looking for about a month before deciding to purchase an Equinox.  Our experience with Sam was quite pleasurable.  He fielded every call (and there were many), answered every question (and there were many),and worked both with and for us to ensure we were satisfied.

We were allowed to make multiple test drives and take our time when looking it over.  While these items may like standard customer service, the freedom to take our time with no rush or pressure helped assure us that we were in good hands; Penske and Sam cared about our satisfaction.

We are excited about our purchase and look forward to working with Penske Chevrolet in the future!",5

He was very sharp from what he was selling me and in his apperrenceas in the way he dressed. He was very patient and he did not try to rush me into buying anything i didnt want just to make a sell.

509,10-Mar-12,"I had a pleasant experience when I purchased the car but getting any service afterwards has been a nightmare. I have called numerous times for a refund for a service I never received and after speaking with several employees no one has ever called me back to resolve the issue. In addition, they promised me some mats and other accessories and they were never delivered to me even though I called twice to follow up.I have hesitated to drive there in person because I live quite a bit away and encountering the same terrible disregard in person after driving 50 miles might cause me to lose my calm demeanor. It is unfortunate when an organization will treat you great to get your business but disregards you once they have your money. I am very disappointed that the service has been so lackluster. ",5
510,07-Mar-12,"Mike got the deal done period.  I went to look at the  Chevy Sonic because I was in the market for a new car that was sporty, great on gas mileage, had a good look to it, could carry a decent amount of cargo and wasn't gutless when you stepped on the gas pedal.  I have to tell you that when I went to Ford they didn't want me to drive the Focus 5 door hatchback, same thing when I went to Hyundai.  Both of the sales people at those dealerships said the same thing.  The cars were gutless and I should wait until the turbo model came out.  I asked to test drive the Sonic and Mike went and got the key and that was that, I was pretty much sold on the car.  I have to say my experience has been outstanding from start to finish.  I activated my On-Star and completely love the service!  Everything about the car is just fantastic, I love to drive once again!  

Thanks Mike and thanks to everyone at Penske for making this a very positive experience.",5

I did a lot of work researching and getting the best price I felt I could get.  This dealership didn't give me the ""when can you come in"" line, they just told me ""yes, we can sell you a car on our lot for that price"".  They gave me the quote in writing that I requested, other dealerships lost my business because they would not do this.  They also got me an even better APR than I negotiated from my bank.  Great, done deal, I made an appointment, and purchased the car.  The only down side was even though I thought everything was a done deal, it still took 3 hours.  

Chris Sanchez and Cathy Sommerville were both professional and pleasant to deal with. ",5

Mike offered to show us a variety of vehicles, he never hesited to go that extra effort to show us a variety of Suburbans. Mike was kind enough to tell us about different deals that Penske was offering. Mike was very patient and respectful at all times, I was extremely pleased with his service at all times. Once I was sure of the truck that I wanted to buy Mike took the time to show me all the features in the truck. All my questions were answered in a very educated manner.

534,06-Dec-11,"This was my 4th Chevy dealer in Orange county and my experience until now was extremely bad in all aspects. I was not really expecting much.
It was a surprisingly positive experience, Alan was a great professional and not only handled to change my sort of negative predisposition to the Chevrolet service centers to a very good one, but made me change my mind about getting rid of my Chevy Traverse definetely he & Cerritos/Penske have my loyalty as a customer.
With a service dept like this, is worth to try their sales dept when it comes the time.

Thanks Alan.",5

Mr. Ordaz was friendly and Professional.  Michael was very responsive to my concerns and made me feel at ease.  I never felt pressured or uncomfortable.  We test drove a 2012 Chevy Camero two times!  Mr. Ordaz told me everything I would ever need to know about this car. He was very informative.   My car buying experience was off to a great start.   After I decided I wanted to purchase the vehicle, we went to financing, to figure out pricing and payments.  Michael and the finance manager were both very receptive to my financial concerns.  Overall, I had a very positive car buying experience.  I will definitely refer my friends and colleagues to work with Michael Ordaz at Cerritos Penske Chevrolet.  ",5

He is very easy to speak with and has a lot of patience which is very helpful when making such a big decision and investment. I definately do recommend he be sought if you need assistance. My overall experience with Thomas was excellent.  Thank You Thomas!,5

547,28-Oct-11,"I have purchased many cars before. However, this has been the best experience I have ever had so far.  I liked that the same person who I talked completed my transaction end-to-end and I did not have to be talking or dealing with some many people.

549,14-Oct-11,"We were just a couple of car shoppers. In our opinion from the first time we walked into the dealership the greeting felt very friendly, upfront helpful and willing to answer all our questions.  Michael Hurst was without a doubt the best car sales representative we've found anywhere. The mood was honest without any pushing.  We came back five different times and test drove the new Volt on four of those occasions and became convinced of the solid value the Volt offered as a lease option. Michael and Tom were definitely very influential in their product knowledge and professionalism towards our considerations and ultimately our purchase decision. Our choice was made easy given the presentation of its' features and cutting edge technology explained and as experienced in our test drives. Our lease options and advantages from the down to the monthly payments to suit an affordable budget were made easy. It was all professionally explained as to how the Volt could work for us.  Though we have only had the car for about a week now, we are very comfortable with our selection and are thoroughly excited and enjoying driving it every day. We feel like Michael is a friend and would recommend others to ask for his assistance in consideration of a new Volt.  Penske Chevrolet Cerritos is a very friendly and relaxed, no hassle place for a car shopper.  ",5

577,11-Jun-11,"My car was recently totalled and I needed a new car ASAP. I went to Cerritos Auto Square because I knew I could look at a large variety of vehicles very quickly. I started at Honda and the salesman was the typical stereotype. He was pushy, he talked too much and even though I told him I came equipped with financing, he insisted on spending time running my credit etc. before I even knew if I liked any cars there. Needless to say no purchase was made. Next, I walked over to Toyota and the salesmen practically ran away from me. Totally rude. I came to find out from the fabulous salesman at Chevy that they saw my notebook and they thought I was just doing research, joke was on them, I was ready to buy. I then walked across the street to Penske Chevy where Thomas Navarrete greeted me in a warm friendly manner. He asked what I was looking for and he proceeded to show me vehicles that fit my parameters and my price range. He educated me on the features and how they would enhance my driving experience based on my job and my needs. He was patient when I asked questions he did not pressure me one bit. He did what a good salesman does. He asked questions and he found a vehicle that would work for me. He then looked at the financing I came with and he arranged better financing. I am a very happy and satisfied customer. Thank you to the Thomas and the team at Penske Chevy of Cerritos. ",5

I couldn't have asked for a better salesperson. She didn't do anything to get me to leave unsatisfied, she made sure that I was satisfied.

595,07-May-11,"I gave the rating I gave because there were some problems with the advertised price verses the sticker price on the car. The discrepancy was realized after the contract was drawn. When I got home I looked up the car on the internet to send pictures to my dad and the price was $1500 lower then the sale price on the window. When I tried to bring it to the attention of the sales team that originally sold me the car, they were not on duty. The sales manager on duty offered to sell me the car at the advertised price but would not negotiate further and was content to void the deal. Who buys the car at the asking price? There's always room for negotiation. If it weren't for the kindness and conscientious efforts and professionalism of Dave Kerric, I would have walked away. Dave Kerric not only saved this deal but the reputation of Penske Chevrolet. ",5
