0,"January 02, 2020","This dealership held my contract information hostage after lying and saying that it was gone, or possibly in some archives. They were slimy and pretended to be friendly and helpful, but only wanted to take up my time to wear me down and sit down with their finance department. All of this to get something printed out. Then they lost my car registration after I asked if they could beat my bank's financing quote. I have to go to the DMV to get another copy. 

Gladys (Finance Director) and Bobby (Finance) - held up my own contracts hostage
David - slimy sales mgr who held me up and lied about what was needed to buy out my lease
Peter - asked me for my keys, didn't explain why, after I asked he said it was to get my registration. After I got home, I noticed it's not in my car anymore. I called Hyundai and he said he will look and call me back. But it's expiring anyway, so do I even need it? Yes, I do, to purchase my car. He was wasting my time by jumping between me and another customer at another table. 
I complained to the Sales Mgr David that I needed things to move more quickly, not as an in-between of another potential sale. That did nothing, and I was still stuck with Peter and his other potential sale. Meanwhile, I saw at least three other salespersons outside meandering with nothing to do. Time is important to customers. Do not treat us like afterthoughts.

Their quoted price was also $2k above what Hyundai Motor quoted me at.  


Service is also slimy. They recommend new tires, complete new engines, and other services unnecessarily. They don't call you when your car is ready. 

There is no emphasis placed on the customer experience here. This place is like a Twilight Zone experience, or like the Bad Place. Go here to be tortured with time wasted and being lied to your face.

The new owners have been in place since July 2019. Before that, I had a decent enough experience here. 

This place is crowded with more self-serving liars than I am willing to guess, and this kind of business only operates in such a way when the ownership allows, endorses or, perhaps, encourages this kind of nefarious behavior. ",1.2
1,"November 25, 2019","I have had quite a few problems with Arnold. Horrible customer service! Told me whoever fixed your car did a xxxx job. ??why? Who talks like that to a guest. I have complained on him military times,nothing has been done. He is the rudest person in costumer service I have had to deal with. Run away if he comes to your car!",1.0
2,"September 30, 2019","Needed a new economical car that would be reliable and easy to drive.  The Hyundai Elantra was just what we needed at a reasonable price.   Ken Lee helped us find the car with the features we wanted.  And in a color we liked.  

Overall our experience at Glendora Hyundai was outstanding.

3,"April 07, 2019","Dealership offered me a 36 month lease, 12k miles, on the Kona EV Ultimate ($45,000 MSRP) for $900+ per month! Almost $1,000 per month lease for a Hyundai!?!
Don't go to Glendora Hyundai.",1.0
4,"October 23, 2018",The sales process was good and Jimmy did his job but the Finance and DMV department hires a bunch of horrible people.  Came in with my own financing and they decided to sign me up for some 3rd rate credit union and then they screwed up my paperwork and submitted the documents to the DMV for tags but did not provide license plates.  They charge you lots of money in fees and don’t do their jobs.  Also the day after I purchased the car the check engine light turned on and when I took the car to the Service department and all they did was reset the code and now it’s showing as Permanent when you hook up the OBD reader.  Stay away from this place.,2.2
5,"July 16, 2018","After a very good experience on our previous car, we came back but wow, things have changed. 
Our Sales guy Sean Morehouse was great. Young but did a good job for us. 
Then we got to the credit department and things went down hill from there.  Without going into detail I would just warn you to be careful. Get everything in writing on the spot because customer service is not there at all. 
As for the service department we only delt with John Slater and he was terrific. 
Unfortunately for Sean, we wll not be going back to Glendora Hyundai.

6,"December 24, 2017","Peter, Rick, and Martin are the BEST!  I came into the dealership rather frustrated and confused. Rick, Peter, and Martin listen and discussed with me what it was I needed and how they could help.  Rick told me that Glendora Hyundai would take.care of me and he was right!  Peter even followed me to return my rental car.  Martin sat and talked with me assuring that I would love my Elantra, and I do!!  Peter was very concerned that I understood everything about my new car.  I am so pleased !",5.0
7,"December 16, 2017","The only issue I had was the price I was quoted was significantly higher than the website’s price. I received the lower price in the end, but I didn’t feel like I was treated fairly on the original pricing. Secondly, during the final purchase it felt a bit hectic and I wish I was given more information during the process on the status of my purchase. Other than that, the sale went smoothly and Vince was the best salesman I have met at any dealership I have been to.",4.8

20,"November 21, 2017",I heard so many good things about hyundai services on my customers at the dish network. And a hyundai employee that's my customer.  You're sales people are very straight forward.  They try to sell me insurance which is understandable it's part of their job. The salesman even drover the car to my house because I'm by myself driving my van. I didn't get this kind of service at LONGO TOYOTA.  Thanks again.  Hybrid with solar panels on top maybe?,5.0

24,"November 02, 2017",The experience was not the best but not the worst. They called me to come down and offered me my current payment or lower if I traded my car in but then kept giving me the run around on the price. Also why does it always take two hours or more for a oil change with an appooitment at the service department?,3.0

But after talking to people, and realizing I don't really need a large car since my daughter is an adult now. I don't need the extra space.

39,"September 30, 2017","Sales Manager Robert Kakish made the overall financial buying experience beautifully comfortable. It came without the usual inflammatory up-sell haggling that normally comes with car buying. Great work Mr. Kakish you're a man of your word, a rarity in today's market.  Sales Professionals: Agustin Castaneda aka Tito (Mentor) to newly charged Mr. Austin were knowledgeable, attentive and all around nice guys, who broke the ice for dealership (valuable to your bottom line) and made us feel warmly invited and at home.

The way the maintenance people approached me was excellent; however, the guy from finance lacks professionalism and he doesn't know how to do sales.

One thing I know about is service and honesty and this dealership lacks both. This dealership has a policy of screwing customers for sport and they have perfected it. The two worst people at the dealership are Morris the sales manger and Mike Hanka the service manger both of which go far beyond the stereotype of sleazy car salesmen. I generally try to take my car to any other Hyundai dealership when I have the time.  If you take the time to read the negative reviews they all trend the same. The dealership has no incentive to help people out. My experience today is just crazy. I took my car in at 7am for a warranty item and now at 2 PM they haven't even looked at the car.

That's nearly a 40 mile difference and 101 is a lot for """"dealer miles"""" and if I had known, I would have taken a different one. There was/is no remedy for that now but I just wanted to note it.

Wish the sales guy would have been more knowledgeable or willing to share info.
Now lets talk about service:.  Took my brand new (purchased in Dec) car into dealer for 1st service.  Service guys weren't rude or anything, just didn't seem to actually want to service my car.  I asked them to look at something and they told me it would take an additional 3 hours!!! WHAT???  A simple thing, like how come safety belts dont automatically retract when I unclick?   Im not waiting 3 hours to have that looked at.  Got in my car after supposed service is done an now ALL OF MY TIRES has LOW AIR WARNING.  They supposedly rotated tires.

We previously came here around june and worked with Bryant Kennedy, our best wishes for him, and unfortunately when we came back he was no longer available. Peter and Rey stepped in to fill his shoes on helping us drive off the lot with the car we wanted. We had our eyes on an Elantra, something small but not too big for the two of us. You might say it was just right. With our situation being a little sticky at the end with insurance, Rey stepped in and helped us out tremendously. Also thanks to Jake for all the info we needed to know and hear about security and insurance for the car. Don't worry we will be back for it. Overall we had a great convo with Jake about food and with me and my girlfriend being foodies ourselves it just made things even better. From the bottom of ours hearts we want to thank each of them on helping us drive off the lot in a car we love.  ",5.0

Jake- Finance manager personable, genuine; I was very surprised at the good deals of the additional items he offered-- I actually asked if he had more items, and he did, but he correctly guaged me and realized I wouldn't be interested in the add-ons he did not originally offer.
Everyone- very nice, friendly
Jorge- porter- very nice- he delivered the keys to us after washing, and applying protectant.
Integrity describes Glendora Hyundai- they honored a ""TrueValue"" price I got after visiting them the first time.
A positive experience-- I was not sold a car-- rather, GH fulfilled my need for a new car in a pleasant way.  GH is the antithesis of the stereotyped hard-sell car sales dealer.
I am so excited about the quality car, wonderful people, and  additional protections I purchased (upholtery, and zero deductible extended warranty all at a very fair price).
I love my Sonata- a beautiful venetian Red with grey interior; I'm still discovering little surprises (like the extendable visors).

The service advisor didn't give me an update of my car until almost 5:30pm and told me the car had to stay overnight. Next morning still didn't get an update until 5:00pm, & was told to pick up car. Apparently it was a ""transmission sensor"" that needed to be fixed and ordered and that they would call me once it was in. A week passed I never Recieved a call so I called to get an update because I rely on my car and it was shifting and not driving well, which almost caused a fatal accident in the freeway. The part that was suppose to be ordered was not ordered. Another week passed and again no call so I called and sure enough the part was in. Took the car in the next morning it took them almost a week to change a sensory part on the transmission. Got the car back and was told there was a 50/50 chance it would work. Well guess what it didn't work. Called the service advisor he said he would talk to the mechanic and call me back. No call and when I attempted to call back they would put me on hold and never answer. I was on hold for 45 minutes and no one gave me a response. Had to call the attribution number since my car is still under warranty. They are now some what on customer service since I called Corp. but still lack alot of professionalism and customer service. The only reason why I gave them a 2 on customer service is because the cashier Star is amazing. Extremely friendly very courtesy and has a huge smile when she greets you. & the shuttle guy don't recall his name was very friendly as well. ",1.5

I didn't think it was possible to get a new car because I had some ""credit issues"" due to the death of my husband. Everyone, the Manager, sales person Dien and Jake Dabney in Finance were all awesome. Then it turned out that I had a slow leak in one of the tires so already I was working with the service department. After my second visit of trying to find the leak, I was given a new tire with no hassle. Everyone was great there and I have already referred my daughter to buy her car there. Great customer service!

410,"July 16, 2013","Well, you hear it all the time, everywhere you go - Hyundai has come a long way... I think its time to set that statement to rest because Hyundai is the standard now!  They are an industry leader as far as I am concerned.  Their designs, technology and service are above what the rest of manufacturers are providing.  I am always pleasantly surprised by how Hyundai gives me so much value and luxury at the same time.  They are the car company that truly cares about the consumer.

For example, when I bought my car from Glendora Hyundai, I was about to sign on the dotted line, when the sales person (whom we developed a great friendship that day) mentioned that he was going to offer another $1000 discount for us!  I was already speechless by the what the Elantra Limited Edition itself was offering!

Another example is how today, Dien walked out to the lot just to hang out with me when he saw me walking about for a good 30 mins looking at cars while I was getting an oil change on my Elantra.  He was very informative and offered alot of surprising suggestions for what our growing family was looking into one day.  At the end of it, no pressure, just a ""hope you have a great day - and was comfortable hanging out at our dealership!""  Wow!

In this current market, where there is a slight upward move in spending by the consumer and the retailers who are eager to grab anyone who as much as looks sides ways in their direction, it was really refreshing to visit Glendora Hyundai and make them my home away from home!

Thanks Hyundai...keep up the good work.

415,"June 24, 2013","I was sold a car in which Blue Link did not work.  It had been two weeks in which I had been working with Blue Link customer service, telling me that they would fix it.  I was calling them daily.  Then I received a phone call from Blue Link Tech setting me up with an appointment.  I told him I could bring it in the next day and he told me no, because they had to send all the parts and that would take at least 5 days.  So I had to adjust my appointment accordingly.  This mean rearranging my doctor appointment which I had been waiting three weeks for and a lady whom I take care of with dementia, Dr.'s appointment.  They also told me that I would receive a loner vehicle for the day and it would all be set up by the time I arrived at my appointment at 10:00.  

I arrived before 10:00 and the service had no idea what blue link was talking about.  They received no parts and no record of a car being loaned out.  I was handled by Mike Chapel (think that was his name) who took really good care of me and was very apologetic.  Also Chris from Tech was running around checking to see what was going on.  They explained what the situation was and again were very apologetic.  I was really happy with the Service I received, not happy with the disillusion that Blue Link caused, but what can you do.  It wasn't the service departments fault.  You may contact me for more information or you may even give me freebees to ease my inconvenience.  I'm open.",5.0

I am not sure why this wasn't caught during the inspection.  4) During fueling at the gas station, the pump shuts off prematurely.  I had a diagnostic scan during this service to determine the problem and a filter was changed out (under warranty).  Tests indicated it was fixed.

He didn't try to ""sell"" me or was pushy, he let me tak my time, answered all my questions and found me vehicles that I was interested in. He was the best salesman for my first new car experience! 

I received a GREAT price for my car and a year later havet seen a better deal for the same vehicle!  The staff at Glendora Hyundai are professional and curtious. I recommend them often and will continue to take my sonata there for services!

It wasn't high or low, but right on the dot for a KBB rating price. Unlike other dealers where they try to shove a used car down your throat, lie to you, or just continue to pressure you, I had no problem with any of that here. They didn't have the color I wanted with the interior I preferred, so John looked it up for some nearby ones. John was super helpful and got the car I wanted for the best price with exterior, interior, and the preferred package too! With everything, the process took about 1 hour to 2.

I have been waiting to buy a car for almost 10 years, finally get my wife to agree(of course I had to crash my old car to nudge her in the right direction).  On the way to the dealership my wife is not in a good mood, she's not looking forward to dealing with the sales pressure etc..(I'm thinking now no way is she going to agree on a car). After talking with our sales guy Peter Wong, she started to talk a little and feel at ease. After deciding on a car it was off to the sign the paperwork with the Finance guy (last step and the car will be mine). After a few minutes I noticed a smile on my wife’s face she’s actually having a good time with buying this car, this is the first time after buying many cars over the years at other dealers that my wife was smiling when going through the process of buying a car.

We were invited to a New Car Event for customers who had just bought a car, what a great way for Glendora Hyundai to help us with questions we have on our car and also show us around the dealership.

Thank you Glendora Hyundai for helping me get my new car and making the process actually fun.

As one of the other reviews that I have read - I have had the same if not worse experience
On Saturday they have promissed me that they will get me a car  from another dealership / we have agreed on the price / and terms and other things as well
I had to pay the deposit - to make sure that I will show up and take the car from them 

They were to get me the car by Monday morning / On monday they called me and let me know what the car they were supposed to get me - They JUST DON`T HAVE IT and that they made a mistake 
They have advised me that they have located one other vehicle of the same color and package but i would have to PAY AN EXTRA 1200.00-1500.00 for the s=transportation because it is too far away .

570,"November 12, 2012","I’ve bought a couple cars from Glendora Hyundai. Initially, we were on a very tight budget and were looking at the Accent, but we choose the 2005 Elantra after a test drive. The Elantra performed very well for 6 years and 145,000 miles. I sold the Elantra to my neighbor who continues to drive it everyday without any problems. After selling the 2005 Elantra we bought the 2011 Sonata. Wow! We really love this car! It has everything and a super warranty, plus free oil changes.

Over the years I come to really appreciate and trust the people of Glendora Hyundai. I really value their quality of service; their respect for customer care and their desire to continuously seek opportunities for improvement. Everyone is familiar with the little things that matter. Glendora Hyundai does all the little things that matter, from free coffee & donuts, to courtesy transportation. The service department has always followed-up to assure superior quality of service and maintenance. You know these people really care!

Here’s an example of how Glendora Hyundai really goes the extra mile. Before selling my 2005 Elantra, I called an asked the sales department if they could get the 2011 Sonata I wanted today. They assured me the 2011 Sonata SE, Charcoal Grey was available. I sold the Elantra and went to meet the sales team. After the paperwork, they drove us home and later that evening delivered the exact Sonata to my home with a full tank of gas.

Of everything Glendora Hyundai offers, I really don’t see any reason to go anywhere else. We are really very happy with everything they do. Thanks so Much!

585,"July 26, 2012","I've never complained like this about a dealer, but I've had an utterly unprofessional experience with Glendora Hyundai's service department. The details are as follows:

I called the Glendora Hyundai service department on Saturday 6/23/12 and explained to their service representative, Mike, that I was noticing unusual sounds coming from the clutch on my Accent. We setup an appointment for me to come in on the morning of Saturday 6/30/12. I came in on the morning of Saturday 6/30/12. Apparently, Mike had the mechanics go over the car to determine the problem. Based on the mechanic's inspection, Mike informed me that he ordered a throwout bearing which he expected to arrive at the dealership on 7/5/12. He said he would give me a call on Thursday 7/5/12 and schedule me to drop my car off Monday morning 7/9/12 to repair my car. Well, on 7/5/12 I did not hear from Mike. So on Friday 7/6/12 I called the service department and ended up speaking to Robert, another one of Glendora Hyundai's service representatives, who said  Mike was on vacation that week. I thought, really, so why did Mike say he would call me on 7/5/12 if he was going to be on vacation that week? Strange, no? Anyway, I said I would call early the next week if I didn't hear from Mike before that. I called again on Wednesday 7/11/12 to followup. Again I ended up speaking to Robert. This time Robert said that Mike had not been on vacation, but had had a death in the family. Confusing, yes? Robert then said Mike would be on duty in about an hour, and he would leave a message for Mike about my call. Well, I never did hear from Mike.

In summary, Mike simply strung me along for a few weeks and then hanged me out to dry while I was attempting to have a potentially or actually serious car problem repaired putting my car and me unnecessarily at risk.

I have to wonder what Mike's excuse is for such shabby, unprofessional conduct? I find Robert's behavior disappointing as well. He seemed more concerned with covering for Mike than helping me as a customer. It doesn't say much for Glendora Hyundai's management that it has loose cannons like this ""serving"" customers. I've notified various members of Glendora Hyundai's management about this. To my knowledge, they've done nothing to discipline Mike and Robert or take action to assure that incidents like this are not repeated.  

It's stunning that their employees would rather give customers the runaround when they could make hundreds of dollars on a repair job, create a loyal customer who would come back for additional service as the need arose and be a source of referrals as well.

Where other dealers have to be nagged to get down in the same neighborhood, John and his guys don't waste your time (or theirs) and give you the best price off the bat.

Of the four local dealerships in my area, John's team was the only one willing to offer a quote by e-mail, and they honored that figure when it came time to deal with them.

When it turned out the model I wanted wasn't immediately available, and that I wasn't interested in the pricier Preferred edition (does anyone need heated seats in Southern California?), John never tried to push me on the upgrade. He was laid back and sincere, and wasted no time reserving the next incoming car that fit my specifications. 

I picked up my new GLS five days later, and John was extremely thorough in demonstrating all the features and controls, as well as explaining all the maintenance and repair options that were covered by the service department. He was a true professional from beginning to end. I wouldn't hesitate to send more people his way.

I told him that I may seem suspicious, but that it was because of how I had been mislead and cheated at a local Ford dealership and a Toyota dealership. I was going to have him prove to me that things were needed and might even get second opinions. He was OK with that and proceded to explain every part of the service they would do. This was the first time I had brought a care to a Hyundai dealer and this one in particular. I had purchased a newer used Hyundai because I no longer trusted the Ford dealership or the Toyota dealership, having caught them in multiple lies and misrepresentations.  I was bringing my recently purchased Hyundai to this dealership as a test to see if they will prove trustworthy.  

I think they did, but further services will be required to confirm that for me. I will continue to report about them what I find.

I was able to test drive without a big production.  Some of the other dealers required copies of driver's licensce.  John was able to answer my questions about the car.  When he was working with me, he was not distracted with other customers.

Some dealerships would stall with me, some dealerships would be straightforward and give me a quote for a given car, but only Glendora Hyundai gave me a price that no other dealership nearby could match, and that was it.  No attempt to stall for extra options, no promises they couldn't keep. The best part? All I had to do was ask over email for the quote.


    Coming in person was even better.  Usually salesmen try to be friendly in an attempt to woo people for profit.  The people at Glendora simply confirmed with me the price they offered online, and simply let me decide ""Yes"" or ""No"".  They are genuinely friendly and they let the price do the talking.  I was literally in and out, which was a welcome relief after having to deal with so many salesmen beforehand. 

    I'm glad I came to Glendora Hyundai, and I recommend this dealership to anyone through the internet sales department!!

606,"December 19, 2011","I went in last night to the dealer ship to buy a new Sonata Limited Turbo, worked out all the details with Steve the sales guy they ran the numbers, my credit and made me an offer.  They promised me a car that they were going to bring in from anohter dealership they negotiated with and have it here today by the evening for me.  As of 2:22 this afternoon i had not heard from anyone as they had promised me they would call me and keep me posted when the car left and aprox what time it would be here to pick up.  i had to call twice this afternoon to try and get an answer ONLY TO FIND OUT THEY DONT HAVE THE CAR !! Not only was i going to get this car but as I walked off the lot I was looking at a second purchase and had them run numbers for me as well.  Mike the GM was rude and completly unhelpful and suggested just retruning the $500 deposit I had left last night and not make a deal after all. These guys gave me nothing but the run around and are complete snakes.  ",1.0

608,"December 04, 2011","I shopped around at multiple dealerships before going to Glendora Hyundai, and John Bryant and Vince Hill on the Internet Team were exactly what I needed.  No BS.  No haggling.  No false promises about what was in stock.  No making me wait while they talked to their manager.  No problems getting a finance deal approved.  Best of all, the quote I received via email was better than what other dealerships had offered, and the buying process was cleaner, quicker, more friendly, and more honest than anything I'd experienced previously.  I highly recommend you ask for a quote online and then go directly to one of the members on the internet team.  Warning: If you just walk in, then you're likely to have to deal with all the haggling that I was able to avoid.",5.0
609,"November 21, 2011","From the moment we entered the dealership, we were welcomed by front desk and several other members. John responded to the call that we were there for him within seconds and made us feel very welcomed. He was very friendly and made us feel right at home. He went out to show us the car we had chosen on line and took us for a test drive. He was very informative and explained things in a manner that was easy to understand. At no time did we not feel very welcomed and important. We felt the same when we were taken over to finance and while dealing with the finance person also. We are very happy with our new purchase and treatment we recieved.",5.0

Got their quote in the email, made an appointment, showed up. They honored the quote without any negotiation. I almost could not believed it since I started out from the Costco car buying program which let me to a dealer that offered me a price quote that was over $3k (!!!!!!!) more than what I paid at Glendora. I am not joking. This transaction saved me over 3 grand serious money. In my case, it was a great experience.",4.2

613,"June 02, 2011","Avoid this dealership! I do not know how they used to be, but I had to deal with Morris, Mike and Alex.  They are dishonest and will try to take advantage of you.  Alex acts like he is on your side, perhaps he is torn on what to do himself, but in the end he is still shady.  Morris, is flat out rude and condescending (at least to females).  Mike can be professional, but can also be extremely prideful and defensive.  

When I first went there, Morris and Mike were not working with me (being rude, dishonest, etc.).  I still wanted to see if I would be approved, but the finance company was closed so they told me they will call me in the morning to let me know if I was approved. In the morning, I received a friendly call from Alex letting me know that I was approved and that I could come in.  (They knew I live an hour away).  Alex told me Mike and Morris were not in so he could work with me on lowering the numbers as well.  

When I arrived, Mike and Morris were definitely there, and he had actually raised the numbers (He had straight out lied to me and he didn't even address it or apologize even when I brought it up).  I drove an hour out there for nothing.  They refused to negotiate and I ended up going to Commerce Hyundai.  I saw AMAZING reviews for Ty and Arnold so I decided to check them out.  

They were amazing, kind, honest, straight up, and worked with me. Everything was very transparent and I didn't feel like I had to figure out what they were trying to play like I had to in Glendora.  Please learn from my mistake.  I don't want anyone else to get ripped off or tricked there because of the unethical things they practice in Glendora Hyundai.   

Oh and Commerce Hyundai gave me the deal on the same car that Glendora Hyundai claimed to be ""impossible""..don't believe what Glendora tells you.  ",1.0

Glendora Hyundai was honest, respectful and professional.

We will definitely recommend this Dealer to our Family and Friend's.",5.0
615,"May 17, 2011","First off my father is elder he went to SAMs club to put gas in and he thought he put in diesel fuel but on a gas car you can not fit the pump of a diesel in he than imidetly took it to Glendora Hyundai were Robert told him he had to drain the gas tank clean fuel system and replace fuel pump knowing their is no way you can fit the diesel pump in that car. After work was completed their has been a strong  odor of gas coming from under the seat took it many times
For repair was given a rental which they were going to pay for  I was called by Mike that problem was not from work they did but from a vent which they charged me for and said they would no longer pay for rental. I picked up car and the odor was still their he replied I can't smell it. Then he refused to work on it I was told by Hyundai to take it to another dealership as they have had many complaints from that dealership so I took it to puente hills Hyundai (I recommend this place) and he came back in and said well that stinks they found the problem Glendora never did the work correctly he had Glendora pay for work but they refuse to pay me back for rental. I am now looking for an attorney to go after them for taking advantage of my father and get reenburstment of rental and having to breath the smell of gas. I would not do buissnes with this company very bad.Remember Hyundai had many complaints about this dealership.",1.0
616,"May 07, 2011","You no I just cant put my finger on it...Why this place doesn't work. It has kind of a bad location behind the in and out burger place, but more just the feeling when you get there. No printed cards the guys just fill in the blank kind of stuff and thge sale force (if you wish to call them that) all feel like they are just looking for something better. I live in Glendora and would have perfected to buy here, but just could not. I had to drive to Long Beach to be treated well and get a good deal. Hope this helps you guys get something going or else in the location you have, I'm afraid that looking for better is all you have",2.0
617,"February 28, 2011","We just purchased a new 2011 Tuscon, and we are impressed with this vehicle. Of course we'll have to wait and see if the quality holds up.

The overall deal though went smooth, and we were out the door in no time. Actually, we were really impressed at how fast we were able to get out of the finance department.

This was our third time at the dealership over the course of 3 months. We weren't quite ready to pull the trigger on another car loan, and we wanted to shop around for the best car/price we could find.

It was by happenstance that we actually stopped by to take another look at the Tuscon, as we were just returning from a visit at a Honda dealer in West Covina. We were kind of tired, and disappointed with the CRV, and it was with hesitation that we did stop at Glendora Hyundai.

It was cold outside, and we didn't really want to be out anymore, so we walked into the dealership and immediately noticed a Tuscon sitting on the floor. Thirty minutes later we had a deal we could live with, and a car we hope that we will love over the years.

619,"December 31, 2010","Got a great internet price quote on a 2011 Genesis and talked several times with Pierce, who was a friendly enough guy.  Verified the price was still good before driving out to Glendora from L.A. in the pouring rain.  Was assured by Pierce that the price was good.  Got there, Pierce was gone and John said the price wasn't good - he upped the price by $400, saying the price had increased since I got my quote.  Give me a break!  The price goes up in a matter of a few hours on a Saturday?!  NOT GOOD!  If Hyundai wants to sell upscale cars like the Genesis and Equus, it needs to clean up its dealers and stop this kind of behavior.  I subsequently bought my new Genesis from Frank Leon, Internet Sales Manager for Harbor Hyundai.  He quoted me a great price AND honored the price when I got there.  The sale was super-easy.",2.8

I WAS SO UPSET, HE SAID I WILL SHOW THE BODY SHOP & SEE WHAT THEY CAN DO. HE TOOK MY CAR UP STAIRS, AFTER A HALF HOUR HE CAME DOWN & TOLD ME I WOULD HAVE TO BRING THE CAR BACK TO BE REPAIRED. SO I SCHEDULED APPOINTMENT, HE ADVISED ME THERE WOULD BE NO CHARGE PER THE MANAGER TO REPAIR. THEN I NOTICED THE REAR END NEAR THE LICENSE PLATE, THEY SCRATCHED PAINT WITH 3 LINES ON MY BUMPER TRYING TO MAKE A NEW HOLE. I TOLD THE GUY THAT NEEDS TO BE REPAIRED ALSO.

NEEDLESS TO SAY THERE WAS NOT TALKING TO THE NASTY MANAGER. WE PLACED 2 CLAIMS WITH OUR INSURANCE, THE MANAGER DID AGREE TO PAY ONE DEDUCTIBLE & WE PAID THE OTHER. I DID TAKE IT TO SEIDNERS IN GLENDORA & THE JOB WAS TO PERFECTION.  ASK ME IF I WILL HAVE USE THEM AGAIN, ONLY FOR THE SERVICE IN THE CONTRACT, AND BY THE WAY I HAVE TOLD EVERYONE TO STAY AWAY FROM THAT DEALER,  I LOVED OUR SALESMAN HE WAS THE BEST, BUT THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT NEEDS A ENTIRE OVERHAUL & NEW PEOPLE..

The lack of ""listening"" to service needed by the consumer is the MOST frustrating. It appears the service managers fail to communicate, or the service staff are incompetent.
We were extremely upset on our last visit,that our problem was Not fixed after having our car all day, which in turn sent us out of town with NO air conditioner.
