1,"August 25, 2019","My experience at Nissan has been by far the best!! From the moment I walked in the lot Anayeli greeted me and my family, she asked me what I was looking for I told her and she instantly knew what Car was best for me, Sure enough I ended up leaving with a beautiful Nissan Altima SR with a GREAT DEAL!!  Anayeli is such an amazing sales person with an amazing sense of humor! She explains everything to you with detail, answers all your questions doesn‚Äôt rush through the sale or make you feel pressured at all to make a decision. Even after purchasing your vehicle she still goes out her way to help you out if you have any questions regarding your car! I highly recommend Ana if you‚Äôre looking into purchasing a  vehicle at Nissan she will give you a amazing deal and you will not regret it!",5.0

7,"February 27, 2019","When I bought my Diesel Titan I asked them would a level kit, void my warranty. He said no. That‚Äôs a lie. A boot ripped and I was told my $60,000 truck has no warranty now. I was coached to have another company install a level kit so I would save $10,000, the day I bought my truck... Randy did try to help me but I do not feel the service department is qualified to put water in a radiator. ",1.6
8,"February 21, 2019","Made an appt to fix the recalls on my car. My appt was at 1045am, I went in 15 mins early. I pull up to their service appt line. There were 2 other appts before me in line, so I asked if they have been helped, both said ""no"". I asked how long were they waiting, ""20mins"". So we are all waiting, 10mins later, someone comes and asked if we have been helped. The guy takes my keys and tells me to wait inside. By this time I'm already dreading the rest of the wait. Service advisor comes back and says it will be around 3pm more or less when the car will be ready. He took my cell phone number down and said he would call when it is ready 
 He let's me know there is a complimentary shuttle to take me where I need to go, but I got a ride from a family member. By 3pm I still haven't received a call, so I had my family member drop me off. As I was walking in, the advisor calls my name and says that he was just about to callüòè. The whole time I was waiting, the recalls did not get resolved because a part needs to be ordered. Why was I not notified sooner?! The advisor said ""he was just told right now an order has to be put in"" so 4 hrs to ""find out"" a part needs to be ordered. This customer service is below acceptable. I had to request this day off, the whole day to give the service team ample time to fix the recalls. Its 415pm I am waiting for a rental because I have to leave my car. As of now, the date my car will be ready is unknown. I will have to explain to my manager that I would have to leave work early on whatever day my car will be ready. Too much of an inconvenience for me and my managers, I am so upset and not satisfied.",1.0
9,"February 19, 2019",They say they will call when your vehicle is ready and they don‚Äôt.  They told me I needed brakes in the rear of my vehicle so I had my dad change them and they were fine. Still had half of the pad left. They are very rude there. I will never go back. I will drive to Visalia to Groppetti where they are much more friendlier and have more reasonable prices. I will not be returning here. ,1.0
10,"February 19, 2019","very good üëç people and trustworthy, they try to help others with their questions and concerns.. which is great that is what I like about it. very helpful people.. ",5.0
11,"February 17, 2019",Overall I had good service from Nissan of Bakersfield especially with the service manager Raul he made sure that everything was done by checking up on the work and inform me of what it needed and what it would cost which I appreciate it made sure that everything came out as it should have been or I just should be I truly appreciate his service and doing his job to the upmost thank you,3.8
12,"February 17, 2019","Every time i take my car in to be serviced, Ariel is always so kind & helpful. He makes sure I am always satisfied with my experience & takes good care of my car, ",5.0
13,"February 17, 2019","Service was ok, just wish the service guy would of explained the findings, front shock requires immediate attention. I was not told about that. I was looking at my paperwork when I got home and seen that it needed attention ",3.2
14,"February 16, 2019","I took my car in for an oil change and PSI correction to my back right tire, as it was showing low air. Oil was changed, tires were rotated, and the service advisor assured me they found no nails and it holes in my tire. A few sars later I had to take my car back in due to that same tire being completely flat. I spoke to the manager Alex and informed him of the previous work. Alex had my tire dipped to further check for any holes in my tire. None were discovered. I explained to Alex, why wasn‚Äôt this performed the initial service? I also noticed the tire that was flat before I took it back the second time did not match my other tires as far as the wear and tear. As well as the tire brand names. After the second visit I noticed my original tire was put back on. In conclusion, Nissan Altima of Bakersfield service department either accidentally put the wrong tire on my car or purposely did it in hopes I would spend more money by purchasing a tire with them. I am not going to take my nisssn here for anymore services, as I now doubt the honesty and integrity of the work the service department performs. ",2.2
15,"February 16, 2019","I took my car in for an oil change and the person who helped me said that they did a routine inspection and everything look good . Stated that the transmission pan  was damaged and had a light leak , I made an appointment to return in a weeek for the leak . When I picked up my car they then said the screws were just loose and they tighten them again he said they did the routine check everything looked good including filter that it had light dust but would be fine , soon as I got home I checked it myself and it was filthy enough to need a change . Why lie or be dishonest on you checking on if it‚Äôs something so simple ?? Obviously now doubt I even got an oil change .  I regret paying for extra warranties and service when it‚Äôs not even been done ! ",1.8
16,"February 15, 2019","The service provided was amazing. It was my first time ever going into Nissan and figuring out what was wrong with my car, at first I didn‚Äôt understand what was wrong but Ariel gladly helped me out through the whole process. Would recommend Ariel to everyone! ",5.0
17,"February 14, 2019",I wouldn‚Äôt choose a different place to buy my very first car. This place was extremely helpful and will guy more cars in the future,5.0

19,"February 14, 2019",Great deal not a lot of back and forth. No nonsense negotiations with the manager Mr Garcia i would go back and purchase my fourth Nissan from this dealership again ,5.0
20,"February 14, 2019","Made an appointment at 4:45, took my car in an hour before my appointment. Service still took an hour. Although Ariel was not my service provider this go around, I appreciate that he acknowledges people who he has helped out before and goes out of his way to say hi. He is the reason I will always come back in the future for any service on my car. ",4.8
21,"February 14, 2019","The sales man, David, was great. He was patient and kind. Helped me to feel comfortable with my decision. We are very happy with our purchase. We appreciate sales men like him. He is definitely a vital part of your company. ",5.0

24,"February 09, 2019","Great staff, helpful when we took our car in. We appreciate the hard work, we just didn‚Äôt like when they said that our warranty wouldn‚Äôt cover if we didn‚Äôt bring it in to dealer for service. I‚Äôm sure it should cover all no matter where we got service because we have service records.",3.4
25,"February 09, 2019",Very happy and I requested vehicle drop off and it was done and services completed .detail I guess they don‚Äôt vacuum or clean inside not to happy about that ..,5.0
26,"February 08, 2019",We like the car a lot. Edgar the salesman did a pretty good job during the sale. His follow up has been poor. We bought the car 2 weeks ago on a Sunday. A part was missing near the front bumper and he said it was ordered and will be in later that week and YOU WILL BE NOTIFIED. As of this date we have heard nothing. I know I could call and I am sure I will have to do that but I‚Äôm the past with other dealerships when you wait they say we don‚Äôt know anything about it then you have to argue to get what was to be a simple task. I would rate it hire because he was good when he made money but I am keeping it real that it will be hard to recommend this location unless something happens soon. I will recommend the Rogue but suggest that get it somewhere else ,3.4
27,"February 06, 2019","I purchased a Sentra 2017 off the lot and was told the car was certified. On my drive home I heard a loud noise and felt air coming through by the corner of ththe windshield. I immediately messaged customer service and they told me to take it in when I could. I took my car in and was told I needed another appointment because they use a 3rd party to put the windshields in, and that I would be compensated with a tank of gas for my inconvenience of driving an hour away. My next appointment was suppose to be scheduled but when I got there no one knew about my appointment (I don't know whwhawhwhat went wrong there), but they provided shuttle service to the mall while I waited for the car to be serviced. It ended up having to be held over the weekend because of a different issue there might have been with the insulation. My car is currently at the dealership getting fixed and the customer service has been superb. At any other dealership, I feel this issue would have been handled horribly but Nissan's customer service has been very helpful and has made things a lot less stressful considering the circumstances.",5.0

32,"February 05, 2019","Actually i paid 12000 cash but didnt get any free service, nothing.  If i paid cash there should b atleast free service or maintenence. Sales person try to show cars when there a dark out there. It should not be like that. My dad is old and he could nt see the colors in dark.  I mean, sale is important but dont try to see ur profit only. Will see how it goes with the car , looks ok so far.  When i brought my car home, i noticed the tyre light was on and oil tank had only 2 lines but the sales person promised me that he will fill the tank and when i went back to get my tank full, the sales person told me to come back tomorrow. So is it a good customer service?  still waiting for license plate  and pink slip. ",1.2

With bad experiences we opted for the extended warranty, around 1900 dollars which was fine to give us peace of mind in case something went wrong. Fast forward to today, a year later, fluid is leaking and requires ""immediate attention per the report. Great we have a warranty and this should be covered. They have no idea there's a warranty, it's not in their system. My husband mist contact the FINANCE dept to check, but we still have the paperwork stating we paid for the warranty... oh, but now they aren't even sure if this is covered under the warranty they sold us. They have to have a certified technician sent out to inspect it, re-diagnose the issue and either confirm or deny if its covered.. i will never purchase another Nissan, they have no idea what they're doing. I have never had issues with my Toyota when something went wrong. Toyota is able to see exactly what my warranty is, and tell me right away if my issue is covered or not, they have never told me to come back another day or call another dept to see if I have a warranty, it shows up when they type in my vin number. These circles were going around in with Nissan is absolutely ridiculous, like nobody has ever purchased the extended warranty in their lives. I'm beyond pissed that they have been unable to resolve this, and my husband has been to the dealership twice And has to return again tomorrow.! ",1.0

But the difference was with the customer service we received from Sergio Castillo in Nissan Sales.  He answered every question we threw at him, that's not something that happened at the other two dealerships.
Sergio went so far as to apologize for the carwash on a rainy day and invited us back in at our convenience on a dry day.

All employees were in the Bay Area charting with no customers.  I went to one of them and asked if I could get the papers for my car since it was finished so I could pay.

I left my car in the workshop for almost a week. To replace transmission

Results:  
The break was not been attended to. Same problem. 
Important Note:
After one week, we discovered the same tyre had the same problem, low pressure.  We took the car back to Nissan workshop and we were told by the mechanic they replaced the punctured tyre instead of the good tyre from the front. (new tyre was rotate to the front)

We lost our confident completely on this one.  I hope the management take note of this serious mistakes.  We know mistakes happened. But it can be serious and endanger the user's.

245,"October 26, 2018","Multiple times I received invitation cards to come to Bakersfield Nissan, bring in my car, and drive out in a new car. The cards were sent to me by Mr. Rene Campos, General Manager, Nissan of Bakersfield with a hand written note stating, ""See me personally...)-something I was disallowed to do upon my arrivals. It was my Versa Mr. Campos's invitation card indicated would be traded for the new car. Twice, I left in the same car I drove into Nissan of Bakersfield looking forward to discuss business with Mr. Campos. It never happened. Instead, I was confronted by floor sales persons who lead me to an cubical office. I explained reasons why I was there and presented invitation cards and yellow notes with instructions over the signature, ""Rene."" I was pressured into discussing business with the sales person who apparently was without discretion to close a deal and back and forth to the General Manager's office numerous times and returned to me for more discussion. I left empty. On the third occasion, I returned to Bakersfield Nissan for the same reason above stated at the invitation of Mr. Campos and ran into the same obstacle. After four plus hours and no food, only water, I was worn down by the pressure. I was presented a 2016 Nissan Sentra I agreed to purchase with an understanding my Versa would be taken in trade. I was escorted to the finance office where I was presented with a pile of documents. I was not allowed opportunity to read the documents before signing. Select pages were push in front of me and the financier stated the title of each document, put her finger on a signature line and said, ""initial here, sign your name here."" In compliance, worn down, and her not knowing, do to military service connected disability, I have low frustration tolerance, I signed document indicating I had sign a lease while I thought I was there to purchase and trade-in my Versa for which I later discovered I's been overcharged for a used
vehicle-the Versa.   The sales person stated Bakersfield Nissan did not want to take the Versa in trade to lower my cost for the Sentra. Because I signed papers for the Sentra, I was told I had to keep the Sentra because I signed the papers. So I left the Versa, drove home in the Sentra and had a neighbor drive me back to Bakersfield Nissan to get the Versa and drive back home. Three days later I drove back to Bakersfield Nissan and as I entered, I was confronted by the salespersons. I told him I did not want a leased vehicle because I discovered I would be charged for mileage if I exceeded a certain number. I explained long distances I needed to travel from my Delano residence to West Los Angeles VA Medical Facility (a little more than 300 miles round-trip,) sometimes several times during the same month and for that reason clock-up lots of mileages, and that I drive from Delano to Bakersfield (approximately 100 miles round-trip) sometimes four to five times a month to the Bakersfield VA Outpatient Clinic for medical reasons. He went to the General Manger's Office. Shot time later General Manager approached me saying he was sorry; however, because I signed the contract, it is binding. 

This year, on or about October 9, 2018, I received a telephone call from a Mr. Sergio stating he was a Bakersfield Nissan Representative and that I had be preapproved to bring in my 2016 Nissan Sentra and drive out in a new car. He asked if I could come in today and I answered, no. How about tomorrow. I answered, no. He asked, when can you come in and emphasized saying, ""If you don't come-in soon, the offer may disappear."" I indicated I could come in Thursday. He replied, ""Okay, I'll put you down for 12:30, October 11th,"" and I agreed.

At 12 p.m. on October 11, 2018, I arrived at Bakersfield Nissan. I was greed by a salesperson introducing himself as ""Jorge."" I told him I was there to discuss with Sergio who called me Tuesday, the 9th-that I wanted consistency. Jorge asked, ""Are you Frank."" I answered yes. He said,  ""Sergio is off today, but he told me about you and stated you wanted to trade the Sentra and purchase a new car."" I replied, ""That's right. That's why I'm here. We talked extensively and back and forth he went to and fro the General Manager's office. He eventually presented me with a document to sign and took it back to the General manager's office. I assume it was an authorization for the General manager to run a credit report. I am awaiting for a copy of my credit reports to see if there were any requires from Bakersfield Nissan on October 11, 2018.

At any rate, I was later escorted to the financier's office where, again, after approximately four hours, I was presented with a pile of documents. Again, I was not afforded opportunity to read the documents before signing. The financier simply told me the title of the documents and putting her finger on  lines instructed me to ""put your initial here and sign your name here."" This instruction and procedure followed as to each document I signed. The only question I asked was why so much when she told me the total sum I would have to pay. She said I had to pay finance and interest and that those provisions applied to every credit contract.

Thereafter, I learned or discovered I was not driving out in a new car as promised by Mr. Sergio who was not there and did not tell me on October 91th, 2018, that he would not be working on Thursday, October 11, 2018. He did not tell me I would be discussing business with George. He told me the lease I signed initially would be converted into a purchase and then traded for a new vehicle. I've discussed this matter numerous time with the Bakersfield Nissan General Manager, Nissan Bakersfield Financier, Nissan Consumer Affairs-distance and regional. Several times I've attempted to meet with Mr. Sergio but could never caught up to him.

For all the above reasons and existing mechanical reasons are reasons for why I state I have been victim of unfair business dealing under pressure and try to manage because I wish not to disturb my credit rating.

I pray Bakersfield Nissan will mean what its employees promise when sending me invitation card and telephone calling me to come in, exchange or trade-in my cars and drive out in a new car. I am one person, the only driver having but one shaded parking space (one car parked out on the street, and Bakersfield Nissan failed to honor terms expressed under warranty, have me driving back and forth where there were recall campaigns on both vehicles, have me make appointments to bring in the vehicles for service which Nissan failed to remedy and charge me for mileage for bringing in the vehicle, then tell me nothing can be done because warranty on the Versa has expired, but failed to perform duties to make or attempt to make necessary transmission repairs while the vehicle was under warranty while the Versa was in Bakersfield Nissan's possession. 

All the above reasons expresses my dissatisfaction and yet, I love Nissan Automobiles and would recommend others to go Nissan. When a customer walks in, he/she is apparently motivated to make a purchase. The dealer does not need to result to trickery or scheme to convince him/her to do anything. Another element I experience, I purchased vehicles Bakersfield Nissan salespersons wanted to sell me, not what I wanted to buy. As stated above, I have low frustration tolerance and easily worn down.

Let the customer take home papers needed to be sign so he/she can read them over and know what the document does and does not contain. In that way, problems pressing me would be eliminated. Trained your financiers to ensure they don't present the customer with document overcharging interest and other costs.

I hope I suffer no adverse consequence simply for having expressed reasons for dissatisfaction for how I was treated. Dallas Nissan Corp. did make some appropriate adjustment in the amount of interest Bakersfield Financier charged on the document she placed before me for my signature. We all make mistakes during sometime in other lives.   ",2.4

389,"August 30, 2018","Driving from placerville to laguna hills it was 3:30 pm on a Thursday afternoon , needing to get to family reunion by 5 pm Friday,and started having transmission problems about 30 miles north of Bakersfield- called the local dealer and they said have walk in service till 4:30 pm- nursed our 2009 Altima there about 4:00pm - Ariel our service promptly reviewed the issue and said they could not diagnose the problem till Friday however arranged a loaner car at no cost until Monday- and were back on the road by 6he also checked our VIN number and were shocked when he informed us the transmission warranty had been doubled to 10 years or 120k miles- we had 95k- we originally planned to return Sunday but stayed in LA till Monday morning- by Sat morning transmission replacement was required and approved as warranty repair and was already removed when we talked then at noon and service manager Chris 
said would be ready for pick up Monday afternoon at no cost including car rental!
They also corrected the steering lock recall under warranty and washed the car as well.
 We made our family reunion on time, had over 5K in warranty costs completed and were only delayed by one day and the only cost was an extra hotel night!

Also I was thinking of letting the transmission cool and trying to get over the grapevine thinking We could be stuck in Southern CA for a week waiting for repairs however Ariel thought they could get the problem fixed by end of day Monday and loaner was no cost either way and finding out about the warranty- it was a no brainer, even if it took a day or two longer. Received a call at 1 pm Monday that car was ready- picked it up and were on our way.

Want to thank everyone at Nissan of Bakersfield - service people, mechanics  and support staff for going above and beyond to make this happen for us.

When I showed up I still had to wait for quite some time to get someone to help me. Once the gentleman helped me I proceeded to go inside and sign up for the shuttle. I waited for a very long time over an hour and then finally saw someone come inside and get these two ladies, I asked around to see if he was the shuttle driver and he was. There was no announcement made that he was there, he just grabbed people and left. I had my nine month old with me so I rushed to the driver and one of the ladies (guest) had an issue with me going without a base for the car seat. She was livid and kept going on about it being illegal (which it‚Äôs not). I decided to wait for the next shuttle. Again, I waited for another hour. I went outside to check on the status of my car and they told me it would be another 1:30. I see the same shuttle driver and ask if I can get a ride this time. Finally I get to go home. They call be later that my car is ready and I have my husband drop me off. I wait in the waiting area for a good 40 minutes before I get any kind of answer about my car. The receptionist is useless. When I see the gentleman that helped me I ask him about my car and he says he was at lunch and why didn‚Äôt the other guy just grab the paperwork for me?

Dealer refused to cover cost of repairs and then sales agreed to split the cost. 
I was told that at the time of their inspection before sales all was good. Ya right , of course they will say that . I mean how many people we know who chicken out of situations and would never man up to a mistake and take accountability and corrective action, a lot right. 

Called the sales guy Salvador and texted him. This guy is all promises and no follow through. Then will not have the basic decency to reply to a text or return calls. Typical slimy sales rep.

As for the service center itself it appears to be short staffed and the service reps have the worst demeanor . No concept of basic customer service. No improvement in 5 years .

966,"February 10, 2018","I came to Nissan of Bakersfield to test drive the Nissan Rogue. I was in the market to buy a car but I was looking at multiple car brands and cars and wasn‚Äôt set on one yet. Jerry was helpful with looking for different types of Nissans but when it came towards the end, we went inside to discuss options. I told him upfront I was just looking. He asked to run my credit and before I signed the paper, I asked how bad it would hurt my credit. He told me that it would only affect it a few points. He was trying so hard for me to buy the car that I don‚Äôt think he realized how uncomfortable I was getting. I started to feel like it was harder and harder to say no and walk out. Mention that I told him multiple times that I wasn‚Äôt planning on buying a car today and my answer was solid.   I didn‚Äôt buy the Nissan but a few weeks later I purchased a car from a different car company. When the ran my credit, they noticed that Nissan ran my credit though SIX banks. Never did Jerry inform me of this every time he came back from talking with his manager about deals and prices. I am so frustrated with the lack of putting the customer first. I also found out the Jerry lied to me regarding his claim that after 4 months of making payments, I could go to a bank and they would refinance my ‚Äúnew car‚Äù and I would be likely to get 0% interest. I learned from multiple people that his statement was wrong. When you go in after four months, I would refinance a used car and the likelihood of getting 0% was unlikely. I will never buy a Nissan because of this experience and I will never refer anyone to this dealership ever. ",1.8

1070,"April 03, 2016","I purchased a vehicle 2015 model, I was told by the sales person and the sales supervisors that the vehicle had had only one owner; they showed me a clean CARFAX report. I stupidly trusted them.
I noticed some abnormal driving conditions in the car that evening when I first drove the car home; it was very unstable on the Highway. I returned the car back to them right the day after of the purchase. One day later they gave me the vehicle back and I was told that they fixed the alignment on it. I drove it for probably 30 minutes on the highway and I noticed the same issues in the car. I was driving it back to the dealership again and lost control of the vehicle on the highway. I crashed because of the unsafe driving conditions of the car. They have refused all the responsibilities in this matter. Now the car is been fixed in a collision center, paid by my car insurance; the owner of the collision center showed me, once the car was dissemble to perform the repairs, that this car had been involved in previous accidents and they had made the repairs very unprofessionally, all ""MICKEY MOUSE"" repairs. What a shame Nissan of Bakersfield. I have tried to contact the sales supervisors and managers in regards of this bad situation but they are never available.
If YOU are thinking at buying a recent model car do not even look at Nissan of Bakersfield. Be aware that even if the CARFAX reports show clean cars. Their vehicles have poor quality repairs from previous accidents. They buy all the cars from the auctions where all the rental companies dispose all their junked cars. I do not want anyone to put their life at risk as it happened to me.

1078,"March 27, 2011","Bought my car from this joke end of January. Gave down payment and all in needed....so I was told.   A few days later the salesman shows up at my door which is 75 miles away. Then goes to my work which is another 20 miles away.  He tells me they revised my contract to better terms. Should have known that was too good to be true.  I look over contract and everything looks legit so I sign and give the Guy some more info he says he needed.  I ask him if he needs anything else he saysno we're done and enjoy the car. 

Maybe a week later he asks me for a copy of my check stub which I'd already given them that info when I bought the car. And offered new ones when he came to my work.  So I FAX him check stubs.   He calls again a few days later.  I'm at work and can't be spending my day resending info to people who are losing it obviously.

So a week or so later...still asking for check stubs. So I send again AND mail em to be sure. 

Next day my boss calls n says the finance company was wanting her to FAX employment verification including pay info.  So she sent it.  I also got a note from my insurance that the finance Co had been added as lien holder. All is good. 

I get a call from dealership saying my approval is going to expire because I did not get them check stubs and add lien holder and give them references. I had given them 6 already. 

The next day I get a statement finally from the finance company
  Payment is due right away. So I call finance Co and ask best way to make payment. They advise western union so I go on my lunch and make payment. Called them back n gave confirmation number. He confirmed they recd pmt.  All done.   I figures dealership is behind on work. Finance Co says all is good.

Almost two weeks later I get woke up at 9:30 my car is being repossessed by the DEALERSHIP! !!! Mind you this is almost two months after I drove off. 

I'm writing this before I can get ahold of the dealership but if they went that far over some papers THEY lost I can only imagine how. That's going to go over when I get aholdof them.

1080,"March 03, 2008","My husband and I both like Nissan cars, however if you want to buy a Nissan I would suggest you travel to another Nissan dealer.  Nissan of Bakersfield is managed by a foriegner who is unethical, and has no idea of American values.

We purchased a brand new 2007 Nissan Quest in 7/2007.  Despite being a new vehicle, it was mistreated while sitting on the dealer lot.  There were numerous scratches in the paint, the headlight was very scuffed, and the interior had several large grease stains in the carpet.

After making the decision to buy the Nissan Quest, it took a total of 3 days and more than 8 hours to complete the transaction.  Despite being ""pre-approved"" by our ban prior to our arrival at Nissan, we were still made to wait for hours.  We encountered deceptive business practices.

Upon driving our new car home we did not have all the accessories that came STANDARD with our car such as: 2 keys, 2 keyless entry remotes, the
cordless headphones for the DVD, DVD remote.  We waited weeks for these items.

The ""new car detail"" was a failure!  We left our car with Nissan for 5 days to have the scratches in the paint fixed, interior stains removed.
After 5 days I returned to pick-up my car to find only 1 scratch had been fixed.  While fixing only 1 scratch on the driver door (ignoring the rest) paint thinner was splattered on the window. 

I had to return another time to have the interior stains removed.  

Another trip was required to fix the driver window, and replace the scuffed haedlight.

There was another attempt to fix the scratches in the paint, but it only resulted in more damage.  While some scratches were fixed, other scratches were made.  We took our car to the dealer with 1/4 tank of gas, and it was returned to us on empty with the gas light on.  I had to drive to the gas station to buy fuel, but the fuel release button was not working, so I had to have it towed back to Nissan.


According to Nissan the fuel tank release button fuse was not plugged in after fixing the window. 

Unfortunately, while plugging the fuel release button back in, the mirror on the driver door came loose and it was impossible to use the norror due to the intense shimmying.

Returning to Nissan was required to have the mirror fixed.
