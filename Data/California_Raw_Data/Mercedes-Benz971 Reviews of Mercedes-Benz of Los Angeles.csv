52,"February 26, 2020",Downtown LA is a great dealership but Mercedes's lease return policy has gotten worse. You cannot expect the car to be brand new after 3 years especially if the car paint is so easily chipped here and there.  Also Mercedes should provide tires that can last up to 3 years and not the cheapest tires that only last 20K miles.  Mercedes was not like this before when I started leasing 15 years ago.  The overall experience of the car has definitely gotten worse.   ,5.0

62,"February 14, 2020","Internet Salesman Javier Lopez went above and beyond to find a car that exceeded my original needs for less per month than any othere dealership! He is fantastic, professional and follows up immediately. Diego Ruano is also exceptional as a product specialist and answered questions I didn’t even know I had the day I picked up my vehicle. Lastly, while Craig Settles in finance gets the job done quickly, I did not appreciate his attitude or remarks re: my choice to decline his add-on service offer. I also would have preferred being made aware of such offers to give me more time to educate myself on whether pre maintenance packages, advance wear & tear coverage, etc is the best choice for me. I won’t let his condescending vibe taint Javier & Diego’s stellar service, but I question whether Settles would have spoken to a man or someone he perceives as more informed the same way... Also, MBLA, please add Lopez & Ruano’s names to your drop down list so that I can rate them the five stars they deserve! Thank you! Loving my Cherry Red CLA!",5.0

Cooper and her team weren't pushy at all nor in a hurry to close a sale. They took their time and let me do my research about the car I wanted to buy. Since it was a cash purchase, I was able to work something out with them and they gave me an incredible deal I couldn't pass on. I then booked a flight ticket to their dealership where Edward took care of me and help me close the sale in two hours instead of a half a day at certain dealerships. It was the best experience I have never had and when I will be ready to upgrade my Mercedes or to do maintenance, I will go without hesitating to MBDTLA. Thank you guys for the formidable experience.

320,"March 02, 2019","On the morning of March 1, 2019, I experienced a front right tire blow-out in the downtown Los Angeles area after hitting a huge pot hole on Beverly Blvd.  I immediately proceeded to the closet Mercedes Benz dealership which was Mercedes Benz of Los Angeles.  Despite having numerous vehicles in its service area, I was immediately greeted by an individual in the service area.  I was thereafter directed to an individual who was (and is) assigned to ""Tire"" service.  My vehicle was designated as an ""Express"" service and I was told it would take approximately two hours to have my tire replaced and the vehicle alignment checked.  The dealership then paid for my Uber transportation to a local restaurant where I was able to have a late breakfast.   In about one and one half hour my vehicle was fully serviced (as well as being washed) and I was on my way.  

Having been a previous BMW (7 series) owner, I can say that the service and treatment that I received at Mercedes Benz and no doubt the Mercedes Benz of Los Angeles dealership was above and beyond the best service experienced in my years of driving and owning BMWs and now Mercedes Benz vehicles.   Thank you once again to the exceptional individuals at the service area of Mercedes Benz of Los Angeles !!         ",5.0

323,"February 27, 2019","We were quoted by our neighborhood mechanic that the repairs would cost $4000. The van only has 40k miles and this would have been something that we would not have been able to afford. 

Barry quoted us $200 for the estimate and was able to reduce the cost to $165 after all was said and done. He also estimated that we would be without the van for 24 hours which he was able to get done in only a few hours which allowed us enough time to get the van back before needing to rent one in its replacement.

Thank you for running an honest service department, for making it easy to pay and for the speedyness of the service.

426,"November 12, 2018","I just bought a 2019 GLC 300 from DTLA Motors. Rafael Gonzalez provided the best and the most pleasant experience in buying a new car 

My first contact with DTLA Motors was two years ago when I was looking to buy a C300. I sent request for proposal to several dealers in LA, OC & SBernadino. I specifically requested email proposal only NO phone calls. They all called! DTLA MotorI was the only one adhered to the request. I received an email from Rafael Gonzalez, in it was a proposal with detailed line items showing the description of the standards and options that were included in the car with the exact cost of each item including tax and fees as well as the id number of the vehicle. I knew which car I was going to get, with what options and for how much before I left my house; and when I got there the car was prepped and ready for me. 

I have owned several different models MB and have had dealings with 4 other MB dealers before I came to DTLA Motors;  and not one of them even came close to the experience I have with DTLA Motors.  This time I made one phone call to Rafael telling him I wanted to trade the C300 in for a new GLC; a little while later, he sent me an email with a detail of the new car that he matched the options with what I chose in the other car, gave me a trade-in price and the bottom line of what I will pay. I got my new car the next day.  

Additionally, everyone in Finance Department starting with the Director, Marouan Mossadaq, is really great; everything was straight forward - no upselling!!!

We were referred by Costco and seriously had a great experience leasing 2 cars   
    Buying/leasing a new car in this day and age has become such a miserable experience to many of us, we actually end up keeping cars longer because we hate the xxxx lies and games.   My last experience with Mercedes arch rival from Bavaria was so bad it almost ended in fisticuffs.   
     But, at Mercedes Downtown Los Angeles, the people were great, professional, and was a win-win for both parties;  We got a decent deal and they leased two units this  year, and possibly two units every three years for many year to come.  
    I do wish the process had taken a shorter amount of time and I am mad at myself for not getting an AMG ......  this is no  reflexion on the dealership though.  I mean, we are getting high ticket items and no one involved wants there to be any mistakes.  
      I am loving my c300, it feels much faster than it really is and it's a blast to drive and the Burmeister system is killer!   The Mercedes app and remote start have absolutely impressed the xxxx out of  me.  
    Our salesman was very chill, relaxed, and helpful.  We live in another state but we will be back for new cars in three years.

540,"July 12, 2018","I was shopping around for 5 months for a BMW M4.. The reason why I was backing away from most dealers is the sales people most of them were too pushy and attitude issues!, Until the day I came accross DownTown LA Motors Mercedes Benz. Rafi/Brian were the 2 amazing men that helped me get this deal done. The Dealer had almost brand new 2018 BMW M4 Competition Package with LCI package with a great price on 6,500 miles!!. Rafi recorded the car for me and sent me a video which no other dealer did or even cared. I met Brian briefly to see what bank would approve me since my credit score low. Rafi and Brian saw how serious I was and stored the car for me. The car was stored for about a week and 4 days!!! amazing.. I finally was able to get the down payment needed and the car was mine in 2 hours which was pretty quick!!. 
Almost forgot.. they even dropped the price of the car and were able to get me a better APR% Thanks Brian!

He is knowledgeable, friendly, and genuinely interested in providing outstanding customer service.  5 stars does not do him justice for he is on top of everything.  I drive an E350 and the service is not inexpensive.  However, the experience at DTLA MBZ, through Frank's able assistance, makes it entirely worth the cost.  The only downside to DTLA MBZ, and it has nothing to do with Frank Phillips, is its recent change from shuttle service to Uber in transporting customers to home or job in the DTLA area.  Uber's service is not as reliable as the shuttle service where DTLA MBZ drivers would transport me to my office 12 blocks from the dealership.  I hope they bring back the shuttle service.

She contacted me because I had several months left on my lease, but since I am a high mileage lessee I was going to go over the allocated miles and incur substantial fees. She provided so much information that none of the other dealerships provided. I truly appreciate her reaching out to me. However, I wasn't interested at the time. So she kept calling. She was very persistent, which I am so happy she was. I still decided to research my options. So I contacted a sales consultant at another dealership. He was slow to respond; informed me that Samantha was mistaken as far as what MB would be willing to do; stated the only vehicle available to me that I was interested in was located up North; and he needed to know ""if I was serious before going any further"". I found this to be insulting. In the end, this dealership could only offer me a 2017 lease, absorb 3 months of the remaining 10 months left on my lease and my payments were much higher. When I contacted Samantha to inform her of my research, she stood by her information. We scheduled an appointment with one of their sales consultant. After meeting with the sales consultant, Ola, he informed me that they could offer a 2018 vehicle, absorb 7 of my 10 payments, include the Maintenance Service and the MB End of Lease Warranty and my payments are still LESS THAN what the other dealership proposed. I questioned him if he was ""sure"" the Maintenance and End of Lease would be included. He said if they are not you do not have to sign the contract. For the day I was scheduled to pick up the vehicle, I informed Ola that I would only have ONE HOUR to do the financing, etc. so it was critical to have everything ready. So, I met with Ola and Gary, the Finance Manager, to sign all required documents (and yes the Maintenance Service and the MB End of Lease was included in the contract) and in the end I was driving off the lot in my new ride in a hour!

834,"August 29, 2017","I picked up my Mercedes C300 from Mercedes-Benz DTLA and dealt with Omar Afifi. I came to DTLA motors by chance after I was concerned I was being taken advantage of at a different Mercedes dealer in the city as it was my first time leasing a car.

I did some research and Omar helped me find an incredible deal that perfectly fitted my commute requirements, performance desires and fitting into a reasonable insurance price category.

What I appreciated most was Omar's transparency. I feared I would have a load of hidden charges sprung on me at final signing but the price remained the same as initially quoted.

The speed and efficiency was also fantastic (while also explaining everything thoroughly). I got in touch with Omar on Sunday evening and drove away in a car I really love on incredible terms 24 hours later.  ",5.0

900,"February 27, 2016","I have a 2007 S550. My car has approximately 144,000 miles. I have spent over $7-$8,000.00 with Downtown LA Motors since July 2015. I think this is excessive. As such, I am seriously thinking about taking my car somewhere else for service. I like the service advisor Tino Eyvazian, as he has been my advisor since 2008. Tino is always nice and professional. I shared my concern with spending so much in a relatively short period of time with Tino's superior Tim. Tim did not think that $7-8,000.00 was excessive for my car being 9 years old. He said that I would be bringing in my car more for service because of the age of the car. He recommended that I buy a new Mercedes Benz. I thought the S-Class could get 200,000-300,000 miles easy before I have to sell it.  Tim was polite, however, not very convincing. If something goes wrong with my car within the next 3 months, I doubt very seriously I would take it back to Downtown LA Motors Benz.  I thought long and hard about sending this review, however, it is my only recourse to address my concern. I would appreciate if someone higher than Tim could call me. Thanks!

904,"January 07, 2016","I was shopping for a new high end 2016 S550 coupe and I contacted a number of dealers in SoCal including DTLA.  DTLA didn't respond to my on-line inquiry until more a week later after I got a pretty good deal (below invoice) with another dealer and ordered a 2016 model.   The ""fleet manager"", Habib Amla, contacted me and indicated he would offer me a better deal.  

I ended up contacting Habib again when I found out that my order will be arriving later than I expected.  Habib first indicated he may be able to get the car I like sooner but never followed up with me again.  I contacted him again a few weeks later to see if he may able to find a car with my preferences (I had previously clearly indicated my color and option preferences and the model year). He asked me to call him so I did, thinking he was able to locate the car.  Instead he told me he has another car with a different color with many more options than I wanted and at a much higher price. All he kept insisting on was for me to meet with him at the dealership.  When I asked him about the invoice price, he arrogantly responded by saying they never discount the price on this type of cars.

I found his dishonest attempt at bait and switch was extremely insulting and infuriating.  When I let him know that I was displeased by his dishonesty, his response was ""did I promise you a 2016?"". It's people like this guy that makes me despise dealing with car salesmen.

I had a very bad experience with DTLA few years ago and had thought the situation had improved; it clearly has not.  I will never approach DTLA Motors again.

If you are looking to buy a car, steer clear of this dealer since they are not willing to offer a good deal while many others would.  Rusnak, Fletcher Jones, and House of Imports were all much more responsive, straight forward, and they all offered me at least $12,000 off.",1.0

In May I brought the car in at 7am and told them I needed the car back at 3:30 pm.  I called the dealership to check on my car and was put to voicemail.  I arrived at Service at 4pm to find out that they hadn't even begun to start work on the car.  They stuck with a loaner and I was forced to make an additional trip to pick up my car the next day -- they did additional service at no charge to compensate me (so that I would try them again).

I have just returned from my second Downtown LA Motors M-B nightmare.  I dropped my car off on Wednesday for a couple of issues.  They said it would take a full day and they wanted me to leave it overnight.  I ended up leaving it for 3 days and only with huge pressure from me did I get my car back -- and the full work requested was never finished!

I wouldn't go anywhere near this dealership!  I called them 6 times while my car was there and I had to actually visit the shop to talk to anyone.  You would think that you would get some reasonable service to go with a $75k car.  I'm not sure what it take for these guys to return your phone call -- but, I'm not going back to find out.

He responded promptly and honestly to all of my questions.  He took the time to show me all of the features of the vehicle and was very knowledgeable with all of the details of the vehicle.

He was good enough to follow me to Seal Beach to accommodate my wife in signing the various documents when she was unable to make it out to your dealership.

Based upon his friendly, honest and helpful handling of this purchase, I will definitely be back to make another purchase and recommend hi and your dealership to friends and associates who may be searching to buy a new or CPO Mercedes-Benz in the future.

Your finance manager - was also very good and made the process simple and easy to understand.

Thank You,

This was our first time brining in our brand new 2013 ML350 (with only 300 miles) for a service repair to the right rear brake light.  The salesperson, Raj Sood, assured us that you would do your best to take care of us.  Your service manager, Jeffrey Willard, delivered on that promise.  Mr. Willard was respectful and diligent in handling the matter from start to finish.  

Mr. Willard definitly eased the pain of having to repair damage to our newly acquired vehicle.  The level of service is rare, and it's a sign that you are doing things right with this dealership.  

We also appreciated the opportunity to share our experiences with management, as this is a testament to your continued reliability.
