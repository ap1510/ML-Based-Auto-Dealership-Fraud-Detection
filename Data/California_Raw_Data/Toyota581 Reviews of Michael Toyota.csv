1,"August 27, 2019","I recently purchased the 2019 RAV4 TSE hybrid small suv and I am over the moon with happiness on my choice. It’s the best car I’ve ever owned. Waheed Mirza was my salesman and if it weren’t for him I wouldn’t have made the right decision on which car to purchase. He was knowledgeable about all Toyota vehicles and answered all my questions. He was kind, not pushy and had my best interest at heart. I actually was more inclined to buy the car because he wasn’t just trying to make a quick sell. He found the perfect car with everything I wanted that suited me and my family best. If you go to Micheal’s Toyota dealership, ask for him! He will help guide you through the process better than any employee there. ",5.0

3,"June 15, 2019","This dealership sold a car to my spouse who is mentally ill. My husband does not have a job, no income of any sort, no cash, and not able to show he can make any payment at all. Michael’s Toyota took advantage of my husband’s severe mental illness. Car was repossessed and towed one month after the purchase. When a car is repossessed you still must pay for the buy you no longer have the car. Michael’s Toyota salespeople should be ashamed of themselves for praying on the mentally ill. ",1.0

7,"February 06, 2019","I took my Toyota Venza for service on 1/25/19, Cheng was my service advisor for my scheduled appt. After evaluating my service records Cheng went over the requirements needed to keep my car performing in the best possible condition, I needed a few services that weren't advised in San Francisco dealership. While I waited for my vehicle which took about 4/5 hours Cheng constantly gave me updates on the repair. I really enjoyed working with Cheng and look forward to more interactions with him as my advisor.

9,"October 25, 2018","My family and I had the pleasure of working with Andreas as one of the Sales associates at Michael Toyota and we were very impressed with his way of allowing us to ask questions about a vehicle we were interested in and not making us feel as though we were naive.  Andreas answered our questions and concerns with straight forward answers, and when he didn't know the answer, he went to find out and came back in a timely manner.  My wife and I both took turns test driving with our children in the vehicle as they are just as much a part of being interested in the vehicle as we were.  Andreas took time to show us how to operate the vehicle as it was a hybrid and with a lot of new technology, and it was really helpful.  Andreas Kipping and his team really made us feel good being there and we will come back when it is time for another vehicle in the future.

At no time did they try to turn us to somethint they already had on the lot.  The actual purchase was like buying a car from a good friend.  Also we drove from Hanford to guy this car from Mr. Stephen Prince.  The car is awesome.  Thanks",5.0

114,"April 03, 2016","I had been shopping for a Toyota Tacoma for some time but I had not really gone into Michael because I didn't think I could get a good deal there and my service experiences with Michael Chevrolet had been pretty bad.

Anyway, one day I decided to ask them about the trucks and a few days later I drove home a beautiful Tacoma TRO Sport, one much better than I'd hoped for, and I got a great deal.

 Never once did I feel pressured or preyed upon.  The Internet manager, salesman, finance man and even the cashier were all professional and friendly. My initial trade value was $2500 more than CM. In the end they increased the value of my trade so that I could get into a truck that was much better equipped than what I thought I could afford.

  I appreciated that they didn't put me in a little room and keep me there waiting and waiting while they decided on what to do. That's one of the things I hate about buying a car. Everything but the final paperwork was done at a table in an open area in the showroom. Very comfortable.

Prior to coming to Michaels, my wife was ignored when she was alone on a competitors lot for 45 minutes, we were left in the salesmans office for 30 minutes while we could see him chatting with the sales manager, the third dealership refused to tell us the price of the vehicle until we drove it.  Needless to say, we walked away from all 3 of these dealerships.  We were on our way home worn out from our dealings when we drove by Michaels & decided to give it one more try.  Our salesman, Randy Benefiel, went over everything he had at the Toyota certified used car lot that was close to what we were looking for.  He then took us across the street to look at what they had on the Michael's Chevy certified used lot.  We drove vehicles from both lots but they did not meet exactly what we were looking for.  Randy never attempted to pressure us into anything.  He answered questions & gave us information.  I ask about seeing a new vehicle for comparison & Randy worked with us for another hour offering great information for us regarding the vehicles & options.  We must have looked at another 15 new vehicles & it was myself that told Randy Benefiel that I wanted to see if we could come to terms on the purchase of the specific vehicle that we wanted.  Negotiations took less than 30 minutes from start to finish & I feel I paid a very fair price for the vehicle & the experience was the best I have ever had purchasing a vehicle from a dealership.

I have a job that has me traveling quite a bit, and as such I go from the LA area through NorCal and CenCal pretty frequently. Love it or hate it, it's a routine you get used to.

Does it sound too good to be true? Get used to it here, because he managed to deliver on that promise. Me, being on somewhat limited time, managed to drop my car off, and then I went to get lunch in the area while the car was getting it's oil changed, and a once-over to make sure that it's safe, as I put on around 25-30K miles a year on it.

Yesterday I purchased my 3rd vehicle a 2014 Toyota Avalon Hybrid. All I can say is the team at Michael Toyota really did a fantastic job. Ernie Ott  was amazing. I went in somewhat confused on whether I should buy the Avalon or the Tundra. Both were on my radar and after some great input from Ernie and some research on Toyota's web sight we decided to go with the Avalon.  They had a great selection of colors and options. I had even looked at Toyota of Clovis earlier but the  choices of vehicles and amount of vehicles on the lot just didn't compare. Financing and paper work was quick and being a Toyota financial account holder from my previous purchase of my Camry made it so much easier to get my vehicle. Another reason I decided to give my business to Michael Toyota was because of my previous experience with Brendan The Sales Manager. Brendan and Ernie were both awesome. 3 years from now Im 100% sure that Ill be back at Michael Toyota for my 4th Toyota. ,4.8

My husband and I recently purchased a brand new Toyota Sequoia this summer 2013, and we have met Ernie then. It was absolutely pleasurable to have work with Ernie this time around, on this second vehicle purchase from Michael Toyota. The reason why I give Ernie Ott and Michael Toyota a rating of 5 out of 5, is because my expectations were 110% met by Ernie and the dealership. I have never been this satisfied with any other dealership until I came across Michael Toyota. And for this dealership to have such excellent salesmen always available to help any customers, who are looking for a pre-owned or brand new vehicle--it makes the process of looking/purchasing a car not as stressful. I am genuinely delighted to have worked with Ernie, and to have him make this vehicle purchase a dream come true. Ernie is an excellent salesman of choice for anyone who is looking to purchase a car from Michael Toyota. He exemplifies true professionalism, persistence, and proficiency as a person, and as a salesman who only wants the best for his customers. I cannot expand on how genuinely satisfied I truly am, to come to Michael Toyota again, and work with Ernie.

Jake DeBussy has been my “go to” person for both my husband and I the last couple of visits. On our Corolla 2009, we have had the oil change, front brakes and the tires changed. On our 2007 Toyota Tundra we have had the water pump changed and oil changed.
Jake is exceptionally well articulated and professional at his job. He provides a friendly environment for all the clients coming in for service. 
Here are my reasons why I believe he is a valued employee:
•	# 1: Great communication skills and approachable
•	Explain what the diagnosis is for the vehicle. Why the components of the mechanisms behave as they do.
o	The customer learns and is better informed of the situation.
•	NO PRESSURE: He gives you options (No surprises of additional cost) However, he does provide suggestions and reminders. He does not tell you what to do.
o	When he does make suggestions, he gives causes of the part in question and the affect it may have whichever path you choose. 
•	Makes the customer feel in control of the care of your own vehicle and that he is on your team.
o	At this point, he doesn’t have to push anyone to make a sale. 

What I learned about tires:
•	Replacing the tires based on the tread
•	Every tire and tire company is different
•	Materials used in creating the tire will depend on how long it will last and how the feel of the drive will be.
o	When the materials are made of a softer rubber, they will give you a more fluent drive, however it will not last as long.
•	Price and warranty comparison other tire centers. (I really thought he would flinch when I asked him about this,… but he knew what the competition had to offer too!) 

What I learned about my brakes:
I was feeling a scratching sensation whenever I would slow down in first or second gear, particularly if I was heading in a downhill direction. I figured to get my brakes diagnosed. Really reminds me of having rocks in your shoe.
•	Technicians recommend changing the brakes when they reach level 3 on the worn out scale. Mine was at a 4.
•	Jake mentioned that rocks could have embedded itself in the brake area and could wear down on the rotors. He was willing to do a test drive. See if my brakes needed to be changed. He did notice the grinding for the brakes.
•	I decided to have my front brakes changed. There were rocks on the front left hand side of my brakes. The rotors had to be shaved down a bit. I am glad I changed it out before the rocks had to do anymore damage.
Overall, I walked away feeling positive about the whole experience. I definitely plan on returning to have the brakes on the truck worked on soon.

The car checked out, and has been running so smoothly. I really appreciate the fast and efficient service without the need for a high pressure upsell. 

I gave Michael and Jake himself such high ratings since this has been my same experience every time I bring my car in. I really appreciate their efficient use of time, service checklists, and the desire to get clients back out on the road right away to allow us to keep earning a living with our Toyotas. Since they are so efficient and require little more than routine servicing, we are able to do that very well, and I am super appreciative for that fact. ",4.8

423,"October 03, 2013"," I had a terrible experience with Toyota management as a whole with not following through with verbal agreements that I would be receiving 3 keys and one additional as vallet and the extremely rude sales manager(Ross Hernandez) stating he's not gonna make me a $400 key because he sold me the car too cheap and he should have waited to sell to someone else for more money. It's not my fault I'm a female that knows about invoice as well as the tmv of a vehicle. I was discouraged with Brandon Kane not following through with a call back, as well as Manager Michael saying he would copy me a  pointless key  that would not be able to open my doors with the alarm set, but would only start the vehicle to cut cost. I was very disappointed with performance of the sales associate that took over for Robert Gushel during the sale on my Rav4 because he was willing to let me drive off the lot without proper coverage of insurance until Robert stepped in at the end if the sale and put his foot down that the insurance needed to be done right, Robert gave me the information to an insurance carrier so I could get coverage that night to take my new Rav home. I'm very disappointed in the staff at Michael Toyota. They're unprofessional, rude and only want to make a sale instead of following through with agreements. When I finally purchased it was near closing time and the finance manager was rude and when i mentioned that to the sales guy the excuse was its late is he wanted to get out of here and go home. I was insulted by him and comment when that night I wrote him a check for $13,000 and had been pre approved with my own bank. It's unfortunate that such a great brand of car is represented by staff like Fresno Michael Toyota. I'm originally from Madera and I regret not buying from my home town.
When I first came into Michael to look  I wasn't planning on buying a rav4.After seeing the price I knew it was out of my budget. I had test drove cheaper SUVs like the kia sportage, rogue, and escape.(all cheaper vehicles) but I was blown away by the test drive I experienced with Robert Gushel. Robert took the wheel first in an intense test drive to show me the performance of the Rav and all features. We also stopped for gas and I got a redbull drink on Roberts tab, I thought that was cool and I had never had a test drive so in depth, I greatly appreciated that. Once I drove the Rav4 I was in love, I loved the base model features of the back up camera, touchscreen, and Bluetooth. I didn't purchase that day but Robert kept in contact with me about rebates in a professional way and didn't nag me. I eventually came back into purchase the Rav, I compromised color but I love all the features. I believe the best thing for Fresno Michael Toyota is to hire more people like Robert Gushel, he's an honest person as well as humble and is willing to stand up for what is right. He's about developing trust and making the customer happy. He's very knowledgable about his product and I believe that if he would have been able to help me throughout the whole transaction my experience would have been 100%. I'd go out if my way to recommend anything for Robert in the future. Advancing him top management would be the best thing for Michael Toyota.",3.4
424,"October 02, 2013","My wife went to the dealership to upgrade our 2011 Prius for the 2013 Model.  We immediately saw Joseph Hunter and my wife remarked that he looked like a nice guy so we talked to him.  This is definitely not our first experience buying a new car and I'm sure we're not alone when we say that we can't stand the typical ""car salesman"" type.  Joseph was definitely not and we had a great experience with him.  Towards the end of the buying process, another salesman jumped in to ""help"" Joseph and he was the epitome of what we did not want. I understand that Joseph was a newer employee, but like said, not our first time so we thought Joseph was doing great on his own.  That's why the overall experience is a 4.  It would be nice to just once buy a car without having a salesman try to talk us into buying a car that we already made our mind up to buy.  ",4.8

We were at the dealer first thing in the morning on August 19, 2013 and were cheerfully greeted by Patrick Ryan and made to feel welcome.

He is persistent and always put in 110% of his effort to find the best car, and price to match our expectations. Finding a car to meet your needs and budget, it honestly can be stressful and time-consuming.

With more professionals out there like this, sales people/professionals would not have a bad reputation in the public eye. I Thank you two gentlemen for your patience and fantastic attitude towards my wife and myself.  The weather was extremely HOT and neither one of these two men seem to acknowledge it at all.  I was able to meet a couple of the managers as well as the Finance Manager.  They all were very helpful and kind. I received follow up after my sale from Ernie, Samuel and the owner Mike Rosvold.  This does not happen as often as one would think and so I want to say it is very comforting to receive such follow up.  This is my second Toyota Camry purchased at Michael Toyota and would not hesitate to purchase another in my next purchase.  Thanks team.  I appreciate you all.  Ernie, you were awesome!

We like quality products and do our best to take care of those investments and that is why this is our third Toyota.

Once the part was located, Jason put the pad on my pedal himself. I was absolutely taken back by their kindness and willingingness to help. Now that's what I call exellence service. I would definitley recomend Michael Toyota Scion.  ",5.0

571,"October 23, 2012",Great dealership!  My service writer Bill Henrickson always goes above and beyond to take great care of me.  It is nice to feel like a dealer rep is on my side instead of the other way around like other dealerships.,5.0

The service was done in a timely manner. AND the new Toyota facility is beautiful--HUGE improvement! Plus I love my new Camry hybrid!",5.0
573,"October 11, 2012","People always ask why I take my 18-year old Toyota pickup to the dealer for service and repair.  The answer is two words - Bill Henrickson.  Bill is a fabulous service advisor.  He always welcomes me by name and I never feel like he tries to up-sale me.  He always shoots straight and works with me to determine the best repair route to take.  I got a taste of the overall customer service at Michael Toyota this past week.  My car was in the shop for a radiator repair.  When they were pulling it out of the garage, one of the workers backed into a pole, crunching the bumper, denting the back panel corner, and bowing out the side panel above the wheel well.  Bill called immediately to apologize and promised they would make it right.  He showed me the damage and explained how they were going to fix it and that it would be to my satisfaction.  They gave me a rental car and sent me on my way.  I came back a few days later to a truck that looked even better than before.  The repair was undetectable.  The fact that they went out of their way to ensure my satisfaction scores high in my book.  I will continue to take my car to Bill and will highly recommend them to anyone!",5.0
574,"October 10, 2012","I have been using Michael Toyota since I bought my first Prius in 2005.  I am now on my second Prius.  Jake has been my service representative from the beginning.  Although I made a slight detour with another dealer, I am back with Jake.  I just could not get the quality of service he provides anywhere else.",4.8
575,"September 11, 2012","My service and hospitality at Michael Toyota Scion was excellent.  My service advisor Mr. Bill Henrickson was very helpful and instrumental in repairing my vehicle.  I liked the way he listened to me explain the symptoms so that he and his technician could find the problem.  I was very impressed that Bill listened to everything that I had to say and was very concise in his attention to detail in his notes that went to the technician so that the problem was diagnosed immediately.  He was so helpful, he even personally went to the technician to make sure he understood all directions and the service was taken care of immediately.  

I have and will be recommending friends and family to Michael Toyota Scion and especially to ask for Mr. Bill Henrickson in service as he is one that truly cares about his customer and likes what he is doing.  Which shows in his performance which is EXCELLENT AND OFF THE CHARTS!",5.0

578,"August 29, 2012",The service staff are friendly and professional.  I've never had to wait on an appointment and the work seems to get done in a reasonable amount of time.  I have had no issues with the service work done.  Repairs or replacement items are clearly explained and I have been shown the worn part(s).  I rate the experience as good overall primarily due to the dealer pricing you pay for whatever you have done.,4.6
