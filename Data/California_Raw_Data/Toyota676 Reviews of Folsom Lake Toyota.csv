11,"March 11, 2020","I've bought  a 2018 CH-R Toyota. I bought the service package and within a year, I've had to replace a few things. The battery went out of the car, then the headlights. Every time I come in to get the oil change I've complained regarding a noise from the car. I never got heard but once and they said they will have the techs check it out. Nothing. I took my car to a different dealer and I HAD to get a new transmission. I am upset because this could have been resolved months ago. I am lucky I had the warranty or else I'd be out of a car. I feel like this dealer did not listen to me. Also they don't care about your time. I spent three hours last time sitting in the dealership waiting for an oil change because I was told they had a staff meeting.  I feel like I was sold a LEMON and my service was sour ! ",1.2

Toyota has a lot of models, but he knew our new car so well he could actually tell me which buttons to push on the dash, steering wheel and GPS. He knew all the safety features too, and was able to quickly explain them on our test drive. Once we had decided to purchase the vehicle, he just did it, not a single hitch.

23,"December 29, 2019","
John is the consummate professional!  He's hard working, detailed, honest, proactive and very customer focused.  As soon as I arrived, he had the car ready and showed me how to cycle through all the gauges and then even setup and paired my phone, he's really good with technology.  

John really makes Folsom Lake Toyota look good and gives them a competitive advantage.  I wish I’d known him 30 years ago, as I would have gladly purchased all my vehicles from him.  

They don't make them like John anymore--he's one in a million! Thanks John, the whole experience was a pleasure, you are VERY GOOD at what you do.  Kudo’s and keep up the good work, the world needs more people like you.

He spent plenty of time with us while test driving the car, and there was absolutely no pressure when I said we needed to do a little more research.  He suggested I call him at any time, for any questions we may have.  When I came back to purchase the car, we were in and out of the dealership in less than 2-1/2 hours!  He even sat with me for a half hour during this time, setting up the Bluetooth and making sure my phone was connected and my contacts were saved, and even preset my favorite radio stations!

Our Friends referred us to John Key three years ago, and
we could not  be more happy with our  2020 Corolla we

ago. Working with John we knew we were getting an honest, best,no haggle
 price from the very start, and it  may sound funny, but he treated us like family.
We would definitely recommend Folsom Lake Toyota for the quick and easy process,
and John Key is our go-to guy for the purchase of our vehicles.  Sincerely, Richard S.

50,"September 01, 2019","We had been looking for a new 2019 pickup truck and had already visited Toyota, Ford, and RAM dealerships in the Roseville area.  We found the salespeople at Folsom Lake Toyota, especially John Key, to be very helpful in researching and locating Tundra pickups at surrounding dealerships for us to test drive.  We plan to drive this pickup truck for 20+ years so we were very precise about our requirements for the engine, types of seats, towing, navigation, and required Toyota safety sense capabilities.  John Key was able to locate a pickup that provided everything we wanted, with no extra option packages that we did not want.  We are happy with the Tundra and the price we paid, and we will recommend John Key and Folsom Lake Toyota to our friends and family.",5.0
51,"August 30, 2019","I bought the 2019 SR5 Tacoma from this dealership on  8/28/19. During signing the paperworks Trent tried to sell me the premium care plus and Toyota VSA package. I bought these packages because he told me that the maintenance costs for 30k and 45k alone would cost more than the total mount I paid for the 5 years/55k miles  premium care plus package that I bought. he told me that he wanted to help me but when I went home a look up the maintenance cost for my truck up to 55k miles from Folsom Lake Toyota service website, it costs way less that what he the package the I prepaid. Of course I was very upset and came by the dealership the next day to cancel them. 
Another issue was that the check engine light came on on the truck the next day I bought the truck. This happened at 30 miles on odometer, called them and they told me to continue to drive it and it will go away after a few miles. It is now at 90 miles on the odometer and it is still on.  I was very concerned that this happened on a brand new truck but they didn't seem to care much after the sale.",2.2

They perform quality work at very competitive prices compared to independent automotive repair shops - even for oil changes. Their prices on tires even beat Costco!

68,"June 05, 2018","Horrible experience!
I brought my truck to Folsom Lake Toyota because I thought I had lost the key for my wheel locks. I called ahead and the receptionist said they had a master key and it would be no problem change them out.  I asked if there would be a charge - she checked with her manager and said no. 

However, once I got there, the sales rep (Kyle Budd) said they either had to charge me or use my 20k mile service. I just bought the truck so I knew they had already changed the oil and rotated the tires. He said, ""Forget about all that. The 20k mile service rotates the tires so there will be no charge.""   I told him to just change out the locks and he began to argue with me about how ""his guys get paid by the job"" and how he was ""doing me a favor"". 

When I told him the receptionist said there would be no charge, his response was, ""Well she's just a receptionist. She really doesn't know what we do here."" He continued to argue and talk over me and finally just walked away. I was dumbfounded. 

After my experience here, I will never be back. The only thing they care about is how much money they can milk out of you.

70,"May 08, 2018","Starting with CarGurus.com, I started looking for used Toyota Camrys.  After visting several dealers, I decided I would be better off getting an older car from a reliable dealer.

Long story short after my husband spoke to the Manager and requested a waiver of any service fees, the service manager assured my husband there would be no charge for the current service.

So we went to Folsom Toyota as Toyota has an equal or greater than following than Honda and the other competitors.  So Brand Loyalty and reliability is very important to us.
The Sales team, Finance team were very easy to work with.  No sharks on the lot, no pressure at all. I mean I really went into this thinking ""I'm gonna be pissed and hate the experience"" but in 13 years Toyota has figured the recipe out.  Be Helpful but not overbearing in the car purchasing process.

I will proudly recommend Folsom Toyota to anyone I meet looking for a great Car Purchasing Experience..",5.0

263,"September 24, 2017","I am incredibly upset with Folsom Lake Toyota.  I took my vehicle in to have the right passenger airbag fixed and two other warranty issue.  The vehicle was late being delivered and I insisted to NOT have my car washed as I was in a hurry for another appointment when I picked up my car.  The dealership washed it anyway.  When I got home, my husband and I discovered that someone at the dealership had dropped a tool on my right front door and tried to use touchup paint to hide it.  When I called the dealership, the Service Manager said 1. We don't have touch up paint and 2. they did an inspection of my car prior.  I said fine, send me a copy of it.  Once I got off the phone, I called the parts department - right next door to the service department, and lo and behold - they had my touch up paint.  The pre-inspection report shows that I have a small mark on my right rear quarter panel, which is absolutely correct.  But not the door.   I called Jay again to advise yet again that Folsom Lake should take care of my car, as I did not cause that damage and it was not there when I had dropped my car off. It is ABUNDANTLY CLEAR that a tool hit my car.  He said that there is no way that the vehicle damage was caused by them.  I said you guys had replaced my right passenger airbag and the door would have been opened....and it is possible that the tech damaged my car.  He began to mansplain, in which I decided to bring my car in to show him the damage.  Unfortunately,  I did have to cancel my initial return appointment because of a work conflict.  I have emailed Jay and the original service advisor repeatedly to try to reschedule - and I have not received a response.  I have over 25 years of insurance experience and have appraised cars for prior insurance carriers.  I am not some woman who doesn't know what is going on.....and it is an absolute insult to be treated in such a manner.  I will never bring my car here again and will tell everyone I know not to bother with this dealership.",1.8

326,"August 14, 2017","My wife and I are very pleased with our new 2017 Toyota Corolla SE purchased at Folsom Lake Toyota from Chris Fabiani.  The entire process took 24 hours with much of the conversation occurring on e-mail.  I had e-mailed a few dealerships requesting information only to be told they needed to see me before they could give me a price on the vehicles I was interested in.  This was a complete turn off and Chris provided everything we needed to decide to visit his dealership the next day.  Once we visited the dealership with our 11 year old daughter things could not have gone better.  Not only did we get treated with respect as a customer and felt listened to, Chris was very accommodating.  We had not decided between a Corolla or Camry so Chris let us drive three different models which helped to make our decision easier.  Once we had narrowed down our choice to two vehicles, Chris brought in a finance manager, I believe his name is Andre, who gave us a reasonable price for both vehicles plus the time by ourselves so my wife and I could discuss our options.  We countered with a slightly lower price that we thought was fair and shortly thereafter we shook hands and the deal was done.

338,"August 02, 2017","Having dealt with car dealers for over 55 years, both as a dealer financing source and buyer/user.this purchase is at the top in terms of satisfaction. 
Initial contact a year ago led me back once more to my contact, John Key. I told him he was one of three remaining options being considered and requested his quote. A comprehensive offer with several options came electronically within an hour which instantly eliminated the other options.
Committed by phone , went in following day to complete purchase. Throwing in a trade option in the middle of closing was handled smoothly.
John Key has 16 years experience, knows his product, his way around the business and his courtesy and knowledge offers real value to the buyer and the dealership. 
When time to take delivery, a young lady, Molly  sat in car with self and wife who will be primary driver and went over in exacting detail every aspect of the vehicles inside, including pairing both phones to the Bluetooth, explaining electronic safety features and any question we could throw her way, even offering assistance if needed in future.
There was also a full tank of gasoline in the car which was an unexpected surprise.
The next day a service appointment arrived by email for the initial vehicle service.
To recap, buying this 2017 Rav4 was a 5 star experience making for a return customer.

No other expenses other than oil changes, batteries, brake pads and tires in 11 years of hard driving.  So, we knew we wanted another Rav4 but we didn't know what trim.  Jerry Costello met us on the lot and showed us the inventory.  We told him we weren't buying that day but he patiently described the differences between the XLE, SE and Limited.  He showed us a lot of cars and never tried to hurry us or pressure us into making a decision.  We thanked him and left.  We came back a week later and took a test drive with Jerry.  Again, he patiently took us through all the features of the car.  We spent a lot of time talking about the features we wanted and it turns out that no one trim met those goals.  Jerry worked with us to try to add options from one to another but it just didn't work for our budget.  The bottom line is that after two days and many hours we walked away from a purchase.  But from beginning to end Jerry was kind, patient, understanding and informative.  He did his best to get the car we wanted at a price we could afford.  It just turns out there isn't one!

462,"February 11, 2017","!!!!SAVE YOURSELF!!!
DO NOT BUY ANY VEHICLE FROM THIS DEALERSHIP!!!
THEY WILL LIE TO YOUR FACE WHILE SHAKING YOUR HAND!!!
THEY WILL CUT CORNERS TO SAVE A BUCK!!!
This dealership experience has been one of the worst events I have ever gone through. I purchased a 2017 Toyota Tundra Platinum on 01/02/17. During the negotiations, I had a due bill made to have a factory Toyota OEM remote engine state put on along with an OEM center console tray and OEM black tundra lettering on the tailgate.
The Following Wednesday, the service department called me to have the OEM parts installed. Upon dropping off the truck, they did not have the proper due bills and acted as though they were not going to install the tray and lettering until I had to supply them with the proper documents. I had to get upset with them and argue that the three items were supposed to be completed that day. I finally got them to install the three items after awhile. The service department called me later to tell me that my truck was ready to be picked up. Upon receiving the truck, the center console tray and black lettering were not installed and they had installed an AFTERMARKET remote engine start/alarm system that had a completely different key fob and had wiring running from my rear view mirror to the windshield with a blue blinking light. Who installs an aftermarket alarm system in a brand new $50,000+ truck? The people that I had received the truck from had no idea what happened and when I asked them why they would install an aftermarket part the mechanic said, ""I am not sure. Most likely to save some money."" I had to drive all the way back to the dealership to get an explanation and a new due bill to remove and reinstall a Toyota OEM remote engine start system. The manager Chad Lewis said they they would give me a detail and fill the truck up with fuel for the inconvenience.
The second time bringing the truck in, I had the dealership remove the aftermarket alarm and install the OEM system. Once receiving the truck back, the aftermarket wire with the blue blinking light was still hanging from my windshield. This service department was too lazy or ""it costs too much"" to remove the whole system. UNBELIEVABLE!! The truck was filthy dirty and running on empty. I had to call Chad Lewis back and have them rush a person over with a gas card in order for him for fulfill their promise from the previous trip. AND!!! My dash was rattling like crazy because they did not put everything back together correctly! I had to call back and reschedule a time to bring the truck back in for a third time. THIRD TIME IN LESS THAN A MONTH WITH A $50,000 TRUCK!!!!!
The Third time bring the truck back, the dealership ""hopefully"" removed the rest of the aftermarket alarm system, or at least what I could visually see and also ""attempted"" to fix the rattle in my dash after multiple attempts. Unsurprisingly, the service department did not fix the rattle, or only fixed it until I could drive home, but at least they removed the wire and blue light after the second attempt.
The Fourth time bringing the truck back to the service department in less than a month of ownership they were still unsuccessful in fully refurbishing their ""hack job of an install."" My truck still rattles like crazy and makes me not even want to drive the vehicle anymore.
I feel as though this New truck has been torn apart so many times that there is no fixing it. I called the dealership and asked for a manager. I ended up speaking with Vanessa Herrera, who said that they would get back to me the following day on how they would help me out. The next day goes by and no call from any of the mangers. I patiently wait until the third day at 4pm. I called and Vanessa Herrera answers the phone and says, ""I was just meaning to call you."" Typical response from someone who has forgotten to do something. Vanessa then goes on to tell me that she spoke with all of their managers and that ""there is nothing else we can do for you."" Who tells a customer ""There is nothing that we can do"" after the dealership is the one who ruined my brand new truck in an attempt to cut corners and ""save some money.""
But wait!!!! Theres more!!!!!
After getting off the phone with Vanessa, I drove down to Folsom Lake Toyota and asked to speak to a manger who ended up being Chad Lewis again. I informed him on the entire situation. I asked him if it would be reasonable to ask for a new truck. Chad Lewis responded with saying that it was a reasonable request and referred me back to the salesman who I originally worked with who they beginning to look for the exact vehicle that I bought. I do not wish for anything more than to have a vehicle that is new and undamaged. I am not tying to con this dealership of anything. The gentleman who was looking up the trucks printed out a list of other truck from other dealerships and showed me them. I then spoke again with Chad Lewis, who said that they would get back to me on a new truck. Before I left, I asked Chad Lewis to put it all in writing. He then stated that he would not put it in writing. He said ""trust me, we will take care of you."" The next day Chad Lewis called and stated that they would not be able to get me a new truck anymore. What man shakes another man's hand and promises him something and then completely lies about it the next day? This is why we have to have lawyers for everything nowadays.
This is not how any business should treat a customer after they purchase a new vehicle.
After a month of having my vehicle in and out of this facilities shop with little success, I was driving my truck today and my truck shut off on me while I was driving and would not start back up. I believe this is due to the aftermarket alarm system that they installed. I have already spoken to and read up on experts in the auto industry and they have stated that these aftermarket systems do not work well with new vehicles and cause many problems. What would have happened if my vehicle shut off and my steering wheel lock up while I was on the highway or is a large amount of traffic? I honestly could have lost my life!! This dealership need to get their act together regarding this situation or else I will be contacting an attorney and will resolve this in my own ways.",1.2

After mocking our last names, Chad proceeded with laughter. Mr. Lewis stated he's worked there for 21 years and if this is truly, that is very sad that a sales manager could act this way AFTER a customer has purchased a $40,000 vehicle. ",1.0

485,"March 19, 2015","I have many good things to say about excellent salesman John Key. I recommend him highly. In short, repeatedly John stepped up (before and after the sale) and saved the process from going sour. If you want specific details, read on. 
     When I saw a new listing online for a used car, I clicked the contact button and John emailed me promptly. He wrote that the car, though listed, was not yet available thereby saving me an 80 mile round trip. He quoted me an internet special price hundreds less than their online ad. I had been shopping for a particular make and model for 3 months, so I knew what price sold quickly and what exceeded the market. The special price was about right. 
     He promised to tell me when the car would be available. Four days later he sent me an email saying the detailing was done and the car would be put on the lot the next morning. He used his phone to send me pictures and a short video (none were posted anywhere on the web). I made an appointment for the next morning, it was John's day off so he set up salesman 'R' with the details of the approved price. 
     On the test drive we noticed a rock chip in the windshield and salesman 'R' promised to have that fixed for free. After the sale, he said the dealer doesn't do it, that we'd have to wait for some third party glass specialist to be visiting their dealership for 'other work', which 'can not be scheduled in advance', so maybe we should avoid the hassle and 'hire someone for $15'. That was nonsense; for one thing, people who do the glue injection charge $40-50. For another this dealership has an auto body repair building and someone on staff who does this task routinely. After multiple calls to the service dept nothing was happening for a week. Finally we contacted John and the service was scheduled and completed the next day. 
     When we purchased the SUV the financing guy talked us into an additional warranty by a third party. However, when we received the policy and reviewed the details the warranty did not cover nearly as much as we thought, so we tried to cancel it. After multiple emails to the finance guy with no response over several days, we contacted John and that afternoon the finance office emailed me the form to cancel the coverage. John said it might take up to 6 weeks to get a refund, but only 10 days later the refund check arrived.

496,"July 17, 2014","Really liked the sales guy. He was friendly, affable and quite laid back - not aggressive at all.
Things turned sour when the negotiations changed to the purchase side.

I agree it was late and everyone wanted to get home but it was partly late because they insisted on the credit application forms prior to the price negotiations. Wasn't my fault that that they took over 90 minutes to get around to talking about the price. There was somewhat of an air of arrogance - after all you are buying a toyota right? what do they have to do to sell the vehicle other than it being a toyota.

Hated the attitude of the senior sales guy. He repeatedly told me that it was late and wanted to get home. Not my problem if you want to sell a car then who cares about your need to get home.

Anyways - turning aside from ad hominem criticisms the price negotiations were weak at best. If one refers to truecar.com I was not even offered a good price let alone a great price. I guess the opinion is one that toyota prius models sell themselves. Not so in my case. I wanted at least a good to great price and it was not forthcoming.

Maybe to give the benefit of the doubt if they are offering a vehicle at a price you want then it might be good.

Within the first 10 minutes of having a conversation with John, I was truly impressed. I can honestly say that he is the first sales man to actually listen to us and found out what we wanted. John found the exact car that we were looking to buy for my niece, a white Toyota Corolla S. My niece had already been approved for a car loan through her bank so we did not need financing.  John is a very friendly and outgoing person who is easy to have conversations with. As soon as my niece arrived John took her for a test drive. John asked us how much my niece had been approved for and what her interest rate was. John then suggested that we try to be financed through the dealership because they may be able to beat her current interest rate. The car was a little over our budget and I personally tried to get my niece to look at a car that was more in our price range. Her heart was set on the Corolla. We decided to see if she would be approved through the dealership. She was. Even though the car was a little more than we planned on spending, because of the interest rate that the dealership offered we were able to keep her monthly payments in her price range. The whole process took close to 5 1/2 hours, due to the dealership being so busy. We were all getting tired and hungry. John had offered to get us dinner and I thought that was very nice of him, we politely declined. For a couple of hours we were sitting around waiting for the finance department, during those few hours we had conversations with John that made us feel as if we had all known each other for years, it truly helped the time go by. I believe that John is one of your BEST sales employees and because of him I have recommended your dealership to a few of my friends. I will continue to recommend your dealership to anyone I encounter that is looking to buy a car because of the outstanding service that we received by John.  I know that it takes very little for a person to submit a complaint and I wanted to take a moment to acknowledge the great customer service that we received.",5.0

526,"December 04, 2012","My wife and I wanted to purchase a new Toyota Camry and we visited every Toyota dealership in the greater Sacramento area (Maita, Elk Grove, and Roseville). Of all the Toyota dealerships, Folsom Lake Toyota was the most professional and reasonable to deal with. They do not use the good cop bad cop negotiating tactics employed by all the other dealerships, and they do not waste your time having you sit at some table while they go in the back to talk to some mystery manager who has ultimate authority. They told us what they could offer with respect to deal terms, offered solutions when they couldn't meet a specific term and provided an overall positive experience. I would note that Folsom Lake Toyota is a corporate dealership and I think that really sets the tone for the experience and level of customer service they provide. If you are looking to purchase a Toyota and you don't want to be subjected to a lot of unnecessary back and forth and want to be treated fairly, I would strongly suggest seeing this group.",5.0

528,"November 17, 2012",We was looking for a 2012 Toyota Prius at several dealers. John Key was friendly and offerd the best price on a 2012. I was in contact with him by phone and internet on several occasion's. We made an appointment with him and traveled to Folsome Lake Toyota after getting an out the door price on a brand new 2013 Prius. After we had sealed the deal and drove the 2013 Prius off the lot and headed home. We were in contact with John Key. Not being from the area we didnt know exactly how to get out of town. It was dark and the traffic was real real bad. John recomended that we stop and eat someware before we headed home. Because the traffic would not be as bad. So we did and John had written derections on how to get out of town. But we still were not sure. So we called John Three Times on his cell phone and he guided us out of town by phone. Not every Dealer would do that. ,5.0
529,"November 09, 2012","John Key was the impetus who started teh ""ball rolling"", but not too fast. He was willing to LISTEN and UNDERSTAND my financial area and what I knew without taking advantage of what I didn't know. He was more than happy to test drive 4 cars at the close of day without any hesitation. His advice was not only for Toyota, but for the customer/buyer as well.
Steve Dowd followed up on John's day off and was more than happy to allow one more test drive. He gave his honest opinion considering what was best all the way around. He also had wordly advice for ""later on down the road"" that enabled me to make a better choice in the purchase of which vehicle was best. I would have been eternally lost without his guidance and thoughtfullness (hot chocolate is a good ""relax the nerves"" assistance). He neaver complained when he had to take me back to the rental car, and to Golden 1 before the finalization of the sale.  Cheerful and a leader involving himself to lead the situation while being ""in sync"" with Mittai Danu and Kerry Kiaser. Steve Dowd has patience like a saint.
Kerry Kiaser was down-to-earth with a wonderful sense of humor while taking care of the business/financial end. He didn't mind repeating himself for a first-time buyer like me and especially--ESPECIALLY--he did NOT ""take me for a ride"" with add-ons without thorough explanations of all additions and allowing ME to make the decisions.
Mittai Danu has a wonderful ability to keep the ice broken, sizing up situations even as they change ever so slightly.  He takes on a contenance that others check to be sure we're all going in the right directions, especially with those who have a lot of questions, he never exuded any impatience when one needs to have items explained in a few different lights in order for the best understanding all the way around for the customer.

Drove the 200 miles to Folsom and saved BIG getting exactly what was promised with no surprises.  This was our second experience with this dealer, the last being about ten years ago.  That deal went just as smooth.  These folks are moving cars using the &quot;volume&quot; concept instead of trying to maximize profit and squeeze each customer for every last nickel on the few cars they sell.  See these guys first, get their deal, use it to compare, and you'll see what I mean.  Most of the time involved at the dealership was spent with Blaid Butler explaining all the many features of the car.

578,"May 15, 2012","Are you looking for a Dealership that offers professional and friendly service? Our family has dealt with Folsom Toyota for many years and we have always had a positive experience.  Although we have purchased several new cars, this was our first time buying a Toyota Certified Used Car and we are so pleased with it.  Both Brennan and Dado are experienced professionals that helped us through the entire process, they answered all of our questions without pressuring us into buying.  They pulled out the Carfax report and went over the vehicle in detail.  If you are in the market for a gently used well taken care of vehicle Folsom Lake Toyota is definitely the dealership for you.  You will have a positive and friendly experience as their customer service is top notch.

I would also like to recognize their awesome service department specifically speaking about Tim and Ryan.  Those guys know how to take care of their customers and get the job done.

I would like everyone to know, FOLSOM LAKE TOYOTA is amazing!!!

My Sales Consultant was a young guy by the name of Trent Wall (Ladies, he looks like NFL QB Kurt Warner).
Trent actually went above and beyond when it came to looking for vehicles in my price range. Trent professionalism stood out. He was detailed and very patient.

When it came down to closing the deal, Certified Sales Manager, Raja Singh was completely outstanding! Not only did Raja give me a great price for my trade in, but also a great deal on a 2012 Toyota Corolla-S. I was shocked! I couldn't believe this GREAT DEAL was happening to me!

I've bought a total of five vehicles in my lifetime and every salesman had a sleazy bent to their pitch and turned into a ""yes-man"" on a dime. Not Andrew! He gave us the pro's and con's backed up with his own personal evaluation of the vehicles we were considering. I entered the dealership already having my mind set on my Prius C with only a few reservations, but he cleared every single one of them up NOT by sugar coating over them, but, with sincere honesty, he elucidated on its shortcomings. This made me feel like I knew EXACTLY what I was purchasing, and not as if I got myself a clunker-in-disguise nor a tag-inflating-why-would-I-ever-need-these-options vehicle. I mean, seriously, every other guy SINCE Andrew all had ulterior motives. 
He made the paperwork process so smooth. Honestly, I did not have great credit but still, Andrew dealt with me very graciously. I was embarrassed about my credit score, but Andrew rooted for me to get the best deal that I could rather than be condescending. I really felt like he was on my side. Every salesman wants to close the deal, but Andrew wanted me to have the best vehicle I could get for my money. He has such a professional yet friendly relationship with the financial suits at the dealership that we were able to strike such a great price for my Prius!
All-in-all, I am extremely glad with my experience at Folsom Lake Toyota. However, the Customer Service, Quality of Work, Friendliness, Overall Experience, and Price all hinged on one guy: Andrew Meisenholder. If you shop here, ask for this dude! Seriously!

The day before i went to folsom lake toyota i was at roseville toyota looking at used Tundra's, i found one i liked and took it to the next step to talk price. This is when it all went south for me, the guy that took me on the test drive was great but the next guy they bring out after that was nice at first then not so nice when i told them im not going to sign anything today. He continued to push and push until i had told them 4 times im not signing anything today. Im not going to use names but this man was turning red in the face, i could tell he was not happy with me. The final straw that broke the camels back was when he made a comment on why i need my wifes permission to buy the truck, that was it for me.

Now lets talk about my visit to folsom lake toyota, first off i looked online and found a brand new truck for the same price that roseville was trying to sell me a used truck with numerous scratches and a dent in the bumper. So i took the drive to folsom lake and was greeted by D.J sihgn, he was very polite and took me for a test drive, i said lets take it to the next level. So D.J introduced me to Tony D. Clay and i was greeted with a smile and a hand shake. I told them about my experience the day before and they assured me it would be nothing like that here. After talking for a few minutes i honestly felt if i wanted to leave that Tony would have shook my hand and said have a great day Adam, but i was going nowhere they earned my business for life. Although my new Tundra will last me at least 20 years i plan on bringing my wife to folsom lake toyota to replace her Chevy Tahoe when needed.

618,"January 29, 2012","We went in to lease a new Scion tC.  A young salesman from the Toyota side (Trent) came over and showed us the car.  He was very polite, knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the car and did not appear too frightened by my handling of the stick shift during the test drive.  His enthusiasm and service were notable from another standpoint as well.  It seems that there are only very small commissions on the scions and because he is not one of the dealership's official scion reps, he was not really in line to gain anything from a sale on that side of the dealership.  Kudos to you Trent!

After the test drive, Trent handed us over to a Scion rep named Eddie Givsan.  Working with Eddie on a Scion purchase was the best experience I have had in a new car dealership and I've done this at least ten times in the last twenty-five years. Part of the pleasure of this deal was the Scion experience itself, the prices are set so there is no haggling about any part of the deal.  The other pleasant part was Eddie himself.  He is a VERY interesting character and was a real delight to work with.  Now we will say that it is no trip to the amusement park, waiting for the financing and paperwork to be done and you could tell that the dealership's management was somewhat less enthusiastic than Eddie and Trent to be selling a small profit Scion vs. their other products.  But Eddie pushed the deal through the office and kept us entertained with his interesting history until the final paperwork was ready.

There was some pressure from the finance guy Kerry, when we were signing paperwork: to buy extra warranties, protections, etc. but the pressure was not unbearable and I'm sure he is required to push those products to keep his job.  The paperwork was all correct and the car was delivered clean and full of gas as soon as we had finished signing.

We would highly recommend both Eddie and Trent if you are going to purchase something from Folsom Lake Toyota.  I can't say that if you're buying a Toyota that you won't get the usual dealership games being played to try to sell you extra muffler bearings and floor mat coatings, but at least on the Scion side, things are hassel-free.

Eddie worked with me to price the vehicle within my range and was the reason I have a new vehicle in my garage right now.  I did not plan on buying a new vehicle but have no reservations and know it was the right thing to do.
Thanks Eddie and Folsom Lake Toyota for a great experience!

634,"January 06, 2012","My overall experience was good. Before this dealer, I bought Toyota Corolla in 2010 from Victoy Toyota, Seaside CA, and my experience was not like this one. Mr. Badwal attended us and made our mind to buy the car as we were not there to buy a car. So great salesman's ship he showed. Manager Muhammad was also nice persone and dealt us well. This dealership, in my opinion is far better than some others and I would like to buy another car in future from this dealership.
My concern was to buy Rav4 on 0% interest and somehow I was assured for that but it could not work and I have to pay interest even I bought 2011 SUV. 
However, all processing was quick and done in a very friendly manner. I wish good luck Mr. Badwal and Mr. Muhammad for their future achievements.

Steve was so easy going and yet so incredibly professional that my grumpy husband jumped on board.  A year later we received a call from Steve and he asked if we still enjoyed our Corolla.  He was what we remembered, down to earth, funny and really professional.  Steve's attention to detail and remembering things about our family was amazing.  Steve cares!

648,"November 26, 2011","My husband and I were going to purchase our first car. We are both college students, and knew this experience would be very stressful. We had gone to a few places and found some wonderful cars, but not the greatest service. Most salesmen were very pushy and just wanted us to sign the papers. They didn't care about what car worked best for us, they just wanted their commission (wee were understanding that this is their livelihood). It wasn't until we went back into Folsom Toyota that we were able to gain a friendship with the salesmen. Steven Dowd, was very friendly, honest, and down to earth. He recognized us from being in their earlier that day. He walked us right in and made us feel very comfortable. He sat with us the entire time, making sure we were well taken care of. He never pushed more sales onto us. We told him our price limit and he never pushed anything more. We spoke with us as if we were long time friends.

I walked in to the dealership not really knowing what to expect but Tony and DJ did an excellent job at making me feel secure in my decision. I was clearly upside down in my previous loan and had absolutely no down payment...my first though was...why try? They took my grim situation and somehow turned it in to a new Corolla! :) 

I went from an old Civic hybrid that basically had nothing come with it to this new car that is totally covered under their protection plan. My car came with roadside assistance (which I didn't have before) as well as free maintenance for the first 25K miles!!

Feels nice to know that my back is covered and that I am now cruisin' in style! :)

They didn't keep us long before reaching a mutually agreeable price, and didn't require excess paperwork as the previously mentioned dealership did.

As soon as we walked out of the car we were greeted by 2 friendly salesmen, one of which was Tony Clay. Tony was not a pushy sales man at all. We were shopping at Roseville automall for 8 hours the day before, and nobody really  could get us a great deal or have such a friendly and personable attitude as Tony did. Tony was such a trooper. We definitely made him work for his money, and he stayed positive the whole 5 hours we talked prices and went back and forth with different decisions. He even sat down multiple times and talked to my husband's father on the phone. Not once did Tony get pushy or mad. He made us feel like it was completely our decision and he wanted us to do what was best for us. He was very patient.

My family has been here twice before and have bought 2 cars those past times from this dealership.  It was just this one manager that had to ruin everything.  You should not do business with him! He treated his customers as if they were stupid.  He was rude from the get go then told my family, ""Let's be nice"" right from the start when nobody was arguing and everyone was getting along just fine.  He wasted out time instead of answering our questions.  We wanted to purchase a 2011 Toyota Corolla S but he demanded that we purchase a 2011 Toyota Corolla LE just so that he can get more profit.  He was immature and did not even smile and gave a half ass handshake when he shook our hands.  My family was ready to buy a car that day but due to his poor service and unfriendly attitude we decided not to buy from someone who was a total asshole.  We will probably go to another Toyota dealership where we can spend out money to people who are much more appreciative and where they actually treat their customers with RESPECT.

671,"May 02, 2009","We went looking for a Toyota Camry V6 or Hybrid. The person handling our request for information and test drive, Rahman, was very good and very friendly. However, when we expressed interest in actually buying the car Rahman brought us to David for further negotiation. Rahman took the information on our old (2005) Toyota Camry that we had discussed as a trade-in option, and also took the keys for our car so that his manager can inspect our car to fix a price for the trade-in.

David started by indicating that the MSPR was $32,000 for the standard 2009 Toyota Camry HYBRID and the invoice price was $30,000. At this point he asked us if we would buy the car right then. We indicated that we wanted to know the best price they could offer us, and then (before buying) we planned to check online to confirm if we were really getting a good offer. 

When we asked for the best deal that we could get, David was visibly upset and then he indicated that we are not ready to buy a car yet. David also indicated that we should go do all the research we wanted to and then come back to him when we are prepared to buy the car on the very same day. As a final offer he asked if we would buy the car right then if he offered to sell the 2009 Toyota Camry Hybrid for $28,000 and bought our old car (2005 Totoya Camry XLE fully loaded w/o Navigation @ 60k miles). When I indicated that I would still have to go back and check online to determine if I am getting a good deal, David said 'just a minute' and walked out. It was about 10 minutes and we were waiting there in the customer cubicle. 

As there was no sign I started to trot outside the cubicle when Bobby (Rahman's manager) walked by and asked if everything was fine. I indicated that we were discussing with David and that he had stepped out about 10 minutes ago. At this comment, Bobby went to the cubicle (where my wife was seated) and pulled a chair and said 'David walked out probably because he did not like your number' - it was a rude realization for us that the dealership salesperson walked out on us!!! And, Bobby now indicated that to 'Help us' he would now negotiate with us!!!

At this point I indicated that I would like to have the keys to my car and leave. Bobby's response - ""Yes, you can have, I am not interested in your car anyway. You wait outside and I will get that key to you."" All these comments were not in a friendly tone or gesture - he was rude in his manners, gestures, and voice. As my wife I were waiting outside we find another person (name unknown) who walks out from inside, goes to our car with the keys, opens the car and starts taking pictures! We just walked to this person and told that were no longer interested in selling or buying a car, took the keys and left the place.

Once I came home I get online and find that the 2009 Toyota Camry Hybrid has the following prices: Invoice @ $24546 and MSRP @ 26900 (Source: KBB.COM). This to me just indicates that David, while making us believe that he gave the best deal in the world, was actually trying to scam us out of our hard earned money by indicating that he would sell the car to us for $28,000 when the actual Invoiceis listed online is just $24546. At a minimum, even if round off the online price the dealer at Folsom Lake Toyota tried to cheat us of around $3000!!!

In conclusion, at Folsom Lake Toyota, not only did the sales people treat the customers in a bad way, they are also not trust worthy. David had actually indicated that he would produce the original ionvoice to us that indicates the price of $30,000 - I am not sure how he made such a statement.",1.0
