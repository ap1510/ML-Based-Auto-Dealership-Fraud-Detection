0,"December 31, 2018",Had massive mistakes with my paperwork when I addressed it I was told I would be taken care of. When I emailed the GM he said yes we made mistakes but we don’t give away free stuff. So DMV paperwork wrong twice. Wrong VIn given to me for a quote. Salesman argued with me that he didn’t sent wrong VIN then harassed me about a bad survey number. A small compromise instead go ahead and blast social media would have been smart. ,1.2
1,"April 02, 2018","Bought a certified pre-owned sonata from them. They didn't smog the car (its part of the certification process), trunk latch failed in three days, strange rattle started a few weeks after purchase, when I changed the oil the air filter looked like it hadn't been replaced once in the 40K mile life of the car (how do you certify a car and not check the air filter?). All this leads me to think they didn't even change the oil. This place is a total joke. Never again. I will be complaining to Hyundai directly.",1.2

6,"December 08, 2017","Buying a new car at Alexander Hyundai in Oxnard was the best experience I've ever had.  I dreaded buying a new car because the last few experiences I've had buying new cars in another state were just awful.  Mike and Bill were just great!  So was Alex!  They were very knowledgeable, friendly, professional and helpful.  There was no stress or long waiting periods; it was a relaxed buying experience.  The cars sell themselves, and with the manufacturer and dealer incentives combined with my trade-in and some money down, I got a very, very good deal on my new car.  I highly recommend Alexander Hyundai in Oxnard and would definitely buy from them again!",5.0
7,"December 08, 2017","I just wrecked my car, a 20 years old Jeep Grand Cherokee which I bought brand new. Sadness aside, now I am in need of a AWD SUV.  The problem was, even with a great credit history, I can't spent a great deal of money with three kids in college.  Alexander Hyundai came to the rescue, not only they found me the right choice, a gorgeous brand new AWD Tucson, they provided a great financing term you just can't say no to.  Korean auto industry really has come to its own, not only their cars are just as reliable as any other makers IMO, they have the same advanced safety features you can only find on other brands' high end cars. I bought my daughter a KIA Sorrento and have been amazed at its economy and reliability.  So when I need a new car, I did not hesitate for a moment to buy a Korean car.  Car's performance, features, and reliability aside, the dealership can be the difference of smile on your face or the nagging feeling of bad experience and bad terms.  Alexander Hyundai is one place I shopped (and I have been to many dealerships) where they truly want to make a deal you cannot refuse, and doing so without any pressure. They even make customer feel fun and comfortable while do so.  In the end, I drove away with a brand new Tucson AWD loaded with features while  saved about $7,000 compared to my daughter's KIA Sorrento (base model with front wheel drive only) with zero percent financing",5.0

When I stopped in at Alexander Hyundai I was exhausted by the process and was even burnt by the dealership in Glendale that resulted in canceling the purchase of a Santa Fe Sport 2.0T Ultimate.    I met Adel who stayed late to meet with me to discuss the potential purchase of 2018 Santa Fe Sport.  I made the meet short and threw the number out I wanted to pay.  He was diligent, patient, and did not inhabit any of the characteristics we have all come to know from dealerships.  He was communicative without being overbearing, he listened to me and made some recommendations which resulted in the best outcome possible.    He made the experience THE BEST car purchase I've made.  Ever.  I couldn't believe it.  It was the whole team- his sales manager, the general manager, and the finance dept that made it happen in the most simple way. These guys really work with you in a fair and honest manner.",5.0

The only downfall for me was the finance gentleman I had to deal with to close the deal.

Bill helped me figure out what would work best with me and my budget; I appreciated very much his straightforwardness. He didn't make me jump through hoops and I really, really appreciated that.  It was so easy!  I already have recommenced Bill and your dealership to 4 people, who will be looking to buy a car next year.  As a former Saturn owner, I was recommended to a dealer, along with 2 other people.  I, in turn, bought 3 Saturns and recommended 3 people who all bought cars from the same dealership and salesperson.  If you treat me right, you have my loyalty. People want to buy cars from dealers who they know have been good to their customers.  I didn't buy a car from another Hyundai dealer in the Valley, because I witnessed things that I didn't like about how they treated my friend and she will never buy a car from them again. Little things they didn't have to lie about (like the advertised price) or could have done (supply car mats to a used car) to encourage a perfect experience. It's the small stuff that people remember.  So, thank you for a great experience at your dealership.  And, thank you, Bill for a very positive car buying experience!",5.0

Why would the sales manager ""John"" and the finance guy throw in a 1300 service contract on my vehicle for a power train warranty ( they made it seem like it was free and they were doing me a favor) when my car was already covered with it!!! And on top of me calling the finance manager out on his xxxxxxxx, he tried to tell me I needed that OPTIONAL warranty In order to get approval from the bank, he even told me he will take my car back if I tried to cancel the warranty. The warranty is fully refundable within 60 days. Complete lies when everything is in the contract. I wouldn't be surprised if they gave me a higher interest rate just to make more money off it it. ( dealers do that, research it) , if they can do this type of lying for a used 8k car , please do not trust them with a 20k car, my payments are higher because of this warranty and even if it's refunded the refund is applied to the principle of my loan, which will not make my payments go down. I will advise everyone to get a preapproval from another bank/credit union. Oh yea I forgot to mention when I came to the finance manager to cancel it within 20 minutes of dealing with me he let multiple customers cut in front of me which had me waiting 3hrs and I left without even getting it cancelled, now I have to cancel it VIA mail.

334,"September 05, 2015","In the previous survey I related  the wonderful experience I had at Alexander's buying  the new 2015 Hyundai Sonata Limited. I will repeat  the ideas previously presented in the survey. The car is terrific and I love it! Hyundai has manufactured a beautiful, intuitive vehicle that includes the best ideas in the automotive world. The experience I had at Alexander's was top-notch! The manager Chuck Barton made the whole experience easy by NOT pressuring me and NOT using common tactics that many dealers utilize and that potential buyers despise. The sales staff was so cognizant of their products, which shows good training at the dealership. A customer appreciates working with knowledgeable staff. Having been in a recent accident that totaled my previous car, I was interested in safety features and the staff well-explained the multitude of devices built into the Hyundai vehicles. Such safety devices saved our lives in our previous vehicle and we wanted to buy another safe car. We appreciate that the Sonata is designed with excellent vision front, sides, and rear along with warning alerts that can prevent tragedies. Also, the Sonata has refined features found in many of the high-end vehicles.  I last drove a Lincoln, and previously Acura TL, Nissan Maxima, and Toyota Supra, and I believe  this car compares with any of those and at a better value.
 It is my hope that in the future  I will see the Sonata in Consumer Reports magazine with the highest reliability ratings possible.  I have already told family and friends about what a great car and good experience we got from Alexander Hyundai. When you care about people, you want them to have the same good things in life that you have been able to get, thus the recommendation to get a Hyundai. Thanks so much!

I spoke with one of their salesmen, Ron Parks, and he was very knowledgeale and friendy and he confirmed this car was still in their inventory. My daughter and I decided to take a drive up to Oxnard and we were glad we did. Ron made us feel very comfortable and, this being my daughter's very first car buying experience, she was nervous as to what to expect. Ron listened to my daughter's concerns, he asked what she wanted in an automobile as well as asking what she was comfortable paying per month, and was very supportive when it came down to working with her through the financing process. He spoke with the finance department several times and he was able to get my daughter into the car she wanted, at the price she wanted to pay, and at a VERY low interest rate at that! We then spoke with Nick Nassimi, who explained all of the details regarding the contract and was very patient while explaiing every question my daughter and I had.

402,"July 10, 2014","It was past time to trade in my 2001 Toyota Camry Solara and after doing my research I decided that a 2012 Hyundai Sonata was what I wanted to replace it.   The car finder service of our credit union found 3 possibilities at Oxnard Hyundai and set up an appointment with Scott Glen to check them out.  Unfortunately the one that was priced lowest was already sold by the time we got there but Scott took us on a test drive in the next best priced one which had slightly lower miles, new tires, etc.   

We decided to buy it and Scott went through the paperwork with us and got us a very fair trade in price on the old car.  The finance manager was able to get us a better rate than our credit union and rolled in an extended warranty for a reduced price that was also lower than the credit union warranty.

We drove the car home and when we got out of the car we noticed for the first time a big scrape and dent on the roof that somehow nobody had seen when inspecting the car earlier.  I'm still not sure how we overlooked it.   I contacted Scott Glen via email and let him know that we were disappointed that a certified preowned Hyundai had such a big cosmetic blemish.   Scott surprised me and said that their dealership would take care of it and provide us with a loaner at their expense.  True to his word the damage was taken care of and I was provided with a loaner at no cost.

I have been to other places and I know what it feels like to be pressured or feel like you wasting their time. I never felt this way. I met the credit manager later and he was also very nice. This dealership is very professional, but at the same time friendly and helpful. I finally met with the person who does the legal paper work and he was very nice and helpful, explaining everything to me. On the whole I had a great experience.  I am also very happy with my car. I would definitely recommend this dealer to anyone looking to buy a good new or used car. Thank you Oxnard Hyundai!",5.0

If there's anything else I can add, it's about the experience of purchasing the car at Oxnard Hyundai.  Francisco was so easy to talk to and work with.  At all times, I felt he was on my side and determined to help me find the right car, the right price, and to assist me in the process.  Everyone treated me with respect, and I truly appreciated the accommodations made for me since I had to meet previously made appointments throughout the day, and it took three total visits  to complete the process.  Even today I called back and asked if one item of the completed contract could be changed, representing an additional savings to me, and I was told that would be no problem.

He showed us exactly what we were looking for. We have a 6-month old son so we needed a safe, affordable car that also had space for a car seat and a stroller. 

There was no high pressure situation that you find with other dealers. Jonathan worked with us to get us a deal within our price range and made sure we left happy that day. It is the only time that shopping for a new lease hasn't been a total nightmare. I would definitely recommend dealing with Oxnard Hyundai, and Jonathan specifically, if you can.

Even though he had been in the industry less than one year, he is the current leader at his dealership.  He was very knowledgeable about the product and he was convincing in his presentation - not the usual pushy clown trying to close the deal every 5 min.  I am a retired sales mgr and I can appreciate sincerity and the goal of earning a customers' trust.  The frosting on the cake was when I told him I lived about a 2 hour drive from the dealership and I was not trading my car in;  without batting an eye, Francisco said he would be happy to deliver it personally the next morning.  He was scheduled to work the next day at 9am, so he asked me if it was OK if he delivered it at 6:30am.  The dealership didn't really want to send another employee along on the 4 hr. total trip, so Francisco had his wife drive the second car to my house - my doorbell rang at 6:00am.

472,"June 12, 2013","This dealership is AMAZING! We pulled up yesterday and immediately were greeted by Francisco, very friendly and asked what we had in mind.  My husband and I explained that we were fully expecting a purchase to be impossible given our situation (recent bankruptcy plus a car to trade in worth significantly less than the amount left on the loan) but thought we'd stop by just to see what the potential options were as we are very interested in purchasing a Santa Fe at some point.  So - knowing full well and upfront that there was slim to no chance of selling a car to us, I expected they would lose interest, tell us it was probably best to wait a year or so, and come back later.  Nope - Francisco actually reassured us that there was actually HOPE and showed us the 2012 certified used car on the lot which was exactly what were looking for.  He then brought in Howard, the finance sales manager, to help us look at all the numbers and figure out what we needed to do to try to make this all work.  They spent HOURS with us, answering our questions and discussing various scenarios and options with no guarantee of selling the car.  They weren't pushy or impatient, they were 100% open, honest, and just incredible.  Howard kept in touch with me the rest of the evening about the various loan approvals, etc, and introduced me over the phone to Kris Warden, who would be speaking with the banks the next day since Howard would be out.  The next day (TODAY), Kris was in constant contact with me throughout the day and I'm excited to report that I have dumped my old terrible car and came home with my Santa Fe with an exceptionally reasonable monthly payment!! 

These guys went above and beyond for us so that we could be in the car we wanted to be in when we wanted to be in it.  I had such negative hopes for this yesterday and now I have one in my driveway 24 hours later! I'm almost in shock.

My experiences with car lots and dealerships in the past have been pretty terrible.  Pushy salesmen, finance guys who really don't want to answer your questions or help you out unless they know for sure you will be given a loan and you will buy their cars, fishy tactics, bad feelings, etc.  Oxnard Hyundai was none of that.  I am so impressed at my entire experience.  They were even nice and friendly and hospitable to my two seven year old girls who were with us!  They have a new loyal customer.  The next time I need another car (or know someone is looking for one), Oxnard Hyundai will be my first and only choice.  ",5.0

477,"April 17, 2013","J.J. Delgado has been our service advisor for 18 years and he is - without question - the most pleasant, the most proficient and the most professional of any employee of any dealership that we've visited in the past decade. He is always so eager to please and is so humble and down-to-earth and compassionate, qualities that are truly rare and wonderful to encounter, and are among the primary reasons we've followed him to 3 dealership service centers in the past 20 years. 

Whenever we pay a visit to Oxnard Hyundai, J.J. is at our vehicle, ears open and ready to listen, within moments. He never assumes that he has all the answers, but will instead ask that we allow him some time to research, or to ask someone more knowledgeable, or to do whatever is necessary to meet our needs. This, to me, demonstrates extraordinary humility and a willingness to serve, as opposed to other dealerships where they're more interested in taking your money than being honest about what your vehicle really needs. In fact, we've practically sworn off of other dealership service centers, because at the end of every oil change, they always manage to find a laundry list of expensive repairs and service that we ""absolutely"" need - while on the other hand, at Oxnard Hyundai, we're always dealt with honestly and J.J. never withholds his honest judgment about whether we should invest in a particular service recommendation.

Apart from his skill, J.J. is set apart from his colleagues because of his attitude and demeanor. Extraordinary patience, kindness, generosity, compassion, friendliness, humility and willingness to serve and help others - all of which are characteristics that Oxnard Hyundai and its owner should be deeply honored to have in an employee. The general spirit of the automotive industry is very competitive, even quite ""pushy"" at times, and we've dealt with salesman and service employees alike who are rude, who don't listen, who are blatantly dishonest and behave as though our showing up and making them do their job is a huge inconvenience. It's truly no wonder why most people would rather spend an hour in a dentist's chair than in a car dealership. And even in those rare moments when you do encounter someone who's being friendly and wearing a smile, it's not long before the friendly face is no longer so friendly and the pressure and pushiness begins. But the men and women at Oxnard Hyundai conduct themselves in a way that should be recognized and celebrated, and made an example for their Honda, Nissan, Toyota, Kia and Ford counterparts to follow. 

J.J. Delgado is truly an extraordinary young man and he has my faithful and confident endorsement, and I do not hesitate to recommend his expertise, his wisdom and his excellent customer service to anyone and everyone. Oxnard Hyundai is a better place because of him, and I hope Mr. Shaw recognizes this. J.J. is the reason we continue coming back and so long as he remains at Oxnard Hyundai, then so will we.   ",5.0

When we pulled in, we began looking at the various vehicles staged on the lot, Karina promptly met us outside on a rather chilly and windy day for this area and was warm from the beginning. She was extremely personable form the start and accommodated us and our needs. Completely easy to work with, she immediately got us in a car for a test drive and during our time spent together was exceptionally great. Being from the East Coast, car buying is something that is dreaded, Karina was the complete opposite of what we are used to and expecting to get. She was lovely to encounter during what usually is a painful process and it was refreshing to not only enjoy the company of a sales person but to also deal with one that was incredibly knowledgeable about the products.

The only 'bad' experience would be with the manager at the beginning of the transaction.  He had told us that there was no way that we would qualify for a lease as the first numbers he showed us where too high.  Then he came back and was able to 'negotiate' the payment AND a lease!  WE thought that was a miracle!  When we mentioned this to John he apologized and then the manager came over to apologize.

He was able to get the payment to a reasonable amount but I wasn't ready to commit so I left. I called a family friend who is a broker, and he said he could get me the Santa Fe I wanted with less down and a lower monthly payment. I worked with him for a week but he never came through with financing. I finally gave up on my friend and went back to John at Oxnard.

529,"January 01, 2013","I had a fantastic experience at Oxnard Hyundai when I leased a new Santa Fe. Francisco went through the sales process quickly and painlessly and was friendly as well as professional. I never felt pressured and really appreciated the transparency and honesty that everybody displayed. I would buy a car from Francisco again, no question.

This was easily the best dealership experience I have had. Top to bottom, everybody I worked with was courteous and professional. Francisco worked with Howard the dealership GM to get me a price on the car that was right where I needed it to be. These guys went well out of their way to work with me on the vehicle, making sure I was getting what I wanted. Steve Curtis in Finance went through all the paperwork and made sure there were no lingering questions. 

All in all, this was a GREAT first impression for Oxnard Hyundai. I will definitely be back again for another car purchase and I'll tell anybody who'll listen to drop in as well. This is what every dealership should be like.

She knew immediately that I was looking at a few different brands of car, yet she took the time to walk me through every possible option I asked her for: best price, best mpg, best price for the mpg, and most importantly, interior size. I'm a very tall man, and can't fit in most economy sedans. Karina took me on several test drives and found me the car I wanted for the price I wanted. She then worked with me carefully to ensure I got the price I was looking for.

She was friendly and knowledgeable about the Hyundai product, and even tried to predict what type of vehicle would be best for me, based on our conversation. She helped to turn a long and exhausting day into a pleasant buying experience. 

Additionally, she called at least two times to check to see how I was enjoying my new Santa Fe, and if I had any questions or concerns.

Thanks Karina, all of your time and efforts are greatly appreciated!

My cousin was interested in getting a vehicle because she is now starting college and working a part time job. We went to a few dealerships and we were not happy. I took her to Hyundai and right away we were greeted by a lovely lady named Karina.  She showed us two cars and my cousin fell in love with one. Karina made us feel comfortable, answered all our questions and if she did not know the answer to a question she found out for us in less then a minute.

Initially I called the insurance company for the extended warranty and was informed that this repair was not covered.  I called back to the dealer and Al Calderon assisted me.  He was very professional and gracious and handled the replacement of my windshield with no cost.  When I brought my car in for the repair, I elected to have the 15,000 mile service and it was detected that the radiator was leaking and would also have to be repaired. Honestly, I was questioning my decision of purchasing this car, but the service I received from the dealer relieved any apprehensions as they were top notch and responsive.  Also, the dealer ended up providing a rental car for me, and again, they handled it very professionally.  I really appreciated the extra effort that Al made for this assistance.

Ditto with Howard Korey, who I worked out the price with. He was firm, he didn't give me a stupendous deal with but it was fair and he was knowledgeable about the car despite the fact that it wasn't a Hyundai. There were a few small electrical things on the dash that didn't work when I test drove the car and they agreed to fix the problems before I bought the car, for no extra charge, and no grumbling.

There is nothing worse than a salesman that is hovering over you.  
We recently visited Oxnard Hyundai to look at the new Santa Fe and were approached by Karina Desiderio.  Wow!  She is so professional and I’m surprised that she is on the lot as a Sales rep and not in a higher position within the dealership.  
She didn’t bombard us with pressure of telling us what kind of car we should buy or asking questions about our trade-in.  She gave us plenty of time to look around the lot without being watched.  When we asked her questions about the cars and she didn’t know the answer, she didn’t BS or lie to us.  She got the answers and she got them quick and that goes a long way with me when buying a car. 
Karina was also very patent with us.  We looked at 5 different cars that day and she was running back and forth on the lot getting keys so that we could look at each one.  Oh and by the way I believe she was dealing with other customers at the same time!

Now, 6 months down the road, I love it even more, with added experience and appreciation for the efficient and very safe response in some challenging situations (which I have to say was a strong aspect of the BMW too of course).

We were about to call it quits and just accept that not a single dealership knew what they were selling or what we were looking for, when we decided to make one last stop at Oxnard Hyundai. As soon as we pulled up we knew this place would be different. Our salesman was Francisco Vazquez, and what a pleasure it was to meet him. He greeted us with a nice, genuine smile and asked us how we were doing today. We really appreciated also how he asked us and LISTENED to what we were looking for. We ended up looking at about four different cars and he was patient and helpful answering all our questions. He even ran to get my wife and I a bottle of water because of the heat. Because of the way Francisco qualified us for the right car, it was easy to come to the decision on the Elantra GT. It had everything we were looking for and is a really fun car to drive. Even the usually grueling task of negotiating price was easy and quick. The price we were offered was very fair, reasonable and most importantly in our budget that we gave.

John patiently reviewed available models, accompanied me on several test drives of some length, demonstrated various features in a comparative way -- within the Hyundai range as well as compared with other brands -- and showed excellent product knowledge.

All this evinces a feeling of trust and an emphasis on customer service, which is increasingly uncommon (paradoxically) in this recession. So I commend John and, by inference, the corporate culture of Oxnard Hyundai, for avoiding indifference on the one hand, and over-selling on the other.",5.0

692,"August 01, 2012","Overall, my experience was 3.5 out of 5.  There were many positive points in the experience, but there were also several less-than-positive points.  I want to end on a positive note here, so I will start with the less-than-positive points.
(1) I am most unhappy that we (the dealership and I) could not reach a reasonable agreement that included a powertrain warranty.
(2) The car smelled strongly of gas after we started it for the test-drive; I announced this to both the salesman and the sales manager; the car then spent seven days going through the 115-odd-point inspection and maintenance that all traded-in cars go through before their resold; when we got the car back, it still smells of gas after it is started.
(3) At the moment of signing, the invoice read more than the ""out-the-door"" price that I and the sales manager had agreed and shook hands upon; on discovering this, I alerted the invoice guy, and he appeared to understand perfectly what I was saying--but, he did not change the paperwork; so, after 15-20 minutes of signing other papers and putting the finishing touches on everything, here comes the final invoice (for more than the agreed upon price), and I said I couldn't sign it, and I reminded him why: we had an agreed upon price; it was an ""out-the-door"" price; ""out-the-door"" means that when I walk out the door, I haven't spent a single penny more than that price; AND I reminded him that I already had this conversation with him just 20 minutes earlier.  Well, of course, he treats me like a psycho after that, rolling his eyes, tearing up the old invoice in front of my face, eyes bulging out of their sockets.  Can you imagine?  He printed out a new invoice with the correct price.  I didn't let it rest there, but that's all I'm going to say here.
OK, now for some honest, good points:
(1)  They are friendly, except for the bulging-eye invoice-ripping incident
(2)  They did a good job on making the car look good.
(3)  The office was clean and cool, and they offer something to drink.",3.6

712,"July 17, 2012","Took in my 2012 Hyundai Sonata SE model for oil, filter, and fuel additive change. Definitely need to schedule an appointment with them as Hyundai is getting popular and people are getting their regular service from them. The price of service is comparable to a lot of other competitors in the market. Staff is helpful and they do not push too much service on your vehicle and does the necessary stuff advised by the owners manual and online.

For a routine maintenance, expect to wait 1 and 1/2 hours for everything to be done, which I feel is a little long in comparison to other oil and lube services in the past. Maybe they are a little short on staff to service vehicles and inspect new arrival of vehicles at the same time. But, there's coffee, refreshments, and a TV to hold you over. Maybe the experience would be grand if Hyundai owners that have their vehicles serviced can freely sit inside the other models as you wait for them to be done, like you can do at the LA Auto Show...I promise not to break anything on the Equus!

I love my Hyundai Accent excellent fuel economy and not the 3,000 mile oil changes I was used to on my old car!)

I was treated to first rate accommodations as I waited for my vehicle to be finished.  It was done before I knew it - and they even washed it! By the way - the first oil change is FREE when you buy a Hyundai :)  The perks never stop with this brand of car. I would recommend the purchase of a Hyundai to anyone.  

Al came back in and told me everything I needed to know about how the car was doing under the hood and put a sticker to remind me of my next oil change.  Then I was on my way.

731,"July 05, 2012","My wife and I just purchased a beautiful Hyundai Elantra GLS from Oxnard Hyundai this afternoon. We worked with Karina and it was truly a great experience. We actually went in on Sunday evening right as the dealership was closing. Howard (Sales Manager) and Karina were the only ones left in the dealership. Howard apologized but told us to come back on the 4th of July and promised that we would get a great deal if we came back and worked with Karina. We arrived on the 4th of July and Karina was expecting us. She showed us all of the available Elantra's on the lot. She was extremely knowledgable with all of the important information that we needed to know about the car. Eventually, we had to go in and start, what is for me, the worst part of car shopping, the negotiation. Typically, this is where the sales person throws out the first set of numbers, I say it is too much and then they go get their manger and he takes over from there. This did no go that way at all! Karina stayed with us throughout the whole negotiation. It only took a couple of trips to the back to see Howard and she had us just about where we wanted to be with a monthly payment. We were shakings hands on the sale in a relatively short amount of time! It was such a low stress transaction! Next, we were off to see Steve in Finance. After the obligatory pitch of various extended warranties and exterior\interior protection products (also with no pressure to buy), we were on our way with a GREAT car at an even GREATER deal!

759,"May 17, 2012","BUYER BEWARE, I purchased a used 2005 Toyota Highlander SUV and unfortunately I had to drive 53 miles to find the vehicle I was interested in and it happened to be at this dealership, what a mistake!

This vehicle had been Certified to be in Good Condition by their own Service Department so I thought well I'm to far away and don't have the time to allow a Mutual Repair Service Station to evaluate the vehicle not that I even know this dealership would have allowed me to do that so I thought, it seemed to drive well so I will bypass having it inspected by another Service Center,""BIG MISTAKE""!

When all was said and done and I drove the vehicle off the lot after it was brought to me by the Sales Rep I got on the 101 N Freeway and as I picked up speed the Hood almost blew off because the Service Department had not checked to make sure it was secured after the prepared the vehicle for customer Departure!

You can imagine what that might have been like if it were you as the Hood was Shaking Violently before I was able to pull off to the service road almost causing a multi-car accident in the process! Lucky for me the latch did not disengage completely! So I got out and secured the Hood myself, God must have had an Angel sit on the hood so it wouldn't blow off completely!

Now I did sign a no return agreement so that means the vehicle is mine once I drove it off the lot! Yes there still is a 5,000 Mile or 5 Months warranty on certain components but needless to say I am not to motivated to let their Service department work on this vehicle now, WOULD YOU???

So, the Bottom Line is that I had to stick another $1500.00 into the vehicle to make sure everything that was working or was in poor operational condition and about to brake that should have been REPAIRED so the vehicle would be Safe To Drive!

Are you getting my drift yet, the Sales guy was very nice and I'm sure he did not know the specifics of the condition of the vehicle but you know MANAGEMENT DID!

772,"April 29, 2012","We were greeted by Tony immediately.   He was very friendly helpful and knowledgeable.   We explained we had an appointment with Scott Glen and he called Mr. Glen who greeted us and had Tony carry on the transaction.  We took the car for a test drive and Tony explained all of the nuances related to the car.  We decided to purchase the car and he took care of the primary information and processing through their credit office and business office.  At all times he made us feel comfortable and was very attentive to us.  We then had them appraise our trade in and after some negotiation we arrived at an agreed upon price.   During the process we also met the General Manager, Credit Manager and Business Manager.  They were all very friendly, helpful and conducted themselves in a businesslike manner.  Purchasing a car can be stressful, Tony and the rest of Oxnard Hyundai personnel made a more pleasant experience.

773,"April 29, 2012","I was actively looking to purchase a sedan. I stopped by Oxnard Hyundai and was greeted by Karina Desiderio. I told Karina that I was intersted in the Hyundai Elantra's.

I did make a few visits to the dealership due to the fact that I was looking at several different competitor vehicles. Karina was an excellent salesperson. She contacted me on several occasions to let me know that they had received more Elantras', but also just wanted to see if I was still considering a Hyundai at all. I did end up going into their dealership and purchasing a new Elantra. Karina was all around the most friendliest, informative,and easy to negotiate salesperson I have ever dealt with.

The next day a family friend told my 19 yr old son he could get a better deal, so my son called Howard (much to my chagrin) and told him we were going elsewhere. Turns out no deal so back to Howard we went. He was gracious and it turns out he worked a deal for me to get a new Genesis and for my son to buy my leased Genesis, everyone happy!...well maybe not my wife. These guys were great easy going and no pressure and willing to work with us. I HATE BUYING CARS. I TRUST NO ONE, IN MY OPINION MOST CAR DEALERS TRY TO GET WHAT THEY AN FROM YOU. This Place was not like that. I worked with Steve in finance and never felt any issues, I had no problem having my son sign the paperwork with these people. My buying experience could not have been better. I may have acted like someone who trusts no one, but these guys still worked with me.

The Store is sparkling and clean, relatively new and selection was good. Might be a little hard to find but once there good things happen. This is my second genesis and I have had service done elsewhere however I am looking forward to reviewing the service department when the time comes.

Again I would recommend this dealership over all others. Howard is the BEST Steve is a calming force, and Tony Lee...put me at ease because he tried to answer every question, maybe not right every time, but he was good.

When my family left the dealership we all felt that we got what we wanted and did not feel we were taken advantage of. Which means they were very good making us think we got a great deal, which we actually we did.

Nothing I had seen up until last weekend seemed to be the ""right"" car.  But as I drove past the Oxnard Hyundai I happened to see a cute Accent.  So I pulled in to get a closer look.  The sticker had all the things I had been looking for.  Then Tony Lee came over and we took it for a test drive.  I liked it!  He showed me all the features and told me all sorts of neat facts about the car.  He was so animated and knowledgeable about the Hyundai line - I learned a lot.  Then I sat in the comfortable showroom while Tony worked with the Sales Manager Howard Korey to get me the best deal.  Howard was hard at work running the show from inside the plexiglass room with the other salespeople - but he still had time to come out and meet me and make me feel at ease like a friend,  not like the potential victim of a dealership congame.  What I liked was that everything was out in the open - I could see the entire process unfold right in front of me..no games or hype.  The negotiation was so low-key and easy - I was so happy with the price Tony and Howard gave me.  I had my own financing preauthorized from my bank - but when I met Steve Curtis -The Finance Manager- ...he gave me a better rate so I ended up financing with the dealer! Steve explained everything about the warranties available but up front told me I was not obligated to buy anything - no hard sell or tricks.  Straight honest talk.  In the end, I felt I had made all the right choices and have NO regrets! I would definitely recommend them AND make another purchase from them.  I love you guys!!!!   ",5.0
827,"January 31, 2012","This is only the second car I've purchased, so I don't have much direct experience to draw from in forming an opinion.  We love our car, though, and have no regrets about the purchase.

We went to the dealership with a pretty good idea of what we were looking for.  We brought our kids with us to get their input on the test drive.  Tony, the salesperson, paid attention to our reactions, and tried to help us all get what we wanted (he couldn't read me, though -- I maintained a better poker face during the test drive).  

The dealership is new and has a state of the art computer display that allows you to easily compare different options on a given model, different Hyundai models, and comparable offerings from other automakers.  Tony enthusiastically showed us how to make use of this tool.

We purchased the car on Thanksgiving weekend, and there was only one service person there.  He was overworked that day, so we spent a bit more time in the dealership than we wanted.  I suspect that was unusual.  We have no complaints about the work done to prepare the car for us.

The dealership is not the closest one to our house, but we felt we'd find more selection and a better deal here than at our alternatives.  Our other car is a Saturn which we chose partly because of their no-haggle policy.  Neither my wife nor I enjoy pushing for a bargain.  We didn't look forward to this aspect of the purchase (to put it mildly).  We did some research on what a ""fair price"" would be for the car we were getting, though, and we got into that ballpark without too much difficulty.  

The one thing I'm not too crazy about with this dealership is that the management forces the salespeople to make a large number of phone calls each day.  I'm sympathetic to the salespeople because my company has a similar policy (though I'm not one of the people tasked to make these calls).  I strongly suspect that such calls rarely improve sales and may damage the business's reputation, so I hope management will re-think this policy.  Despite that kind of pressure, Tony waited for us to call back rather than call us between our first visit when we took the test drive and the second visit when we purchased the car.  

We have no regrets about going to this dealership.  Given the ages of our children (and our Saturn), it is likely we will be purchasing another car in the next few years.  We will strongly consider going back to the same dealer.

846,"December 24, 2011","I was looking for a new car for my 17 year old daughter, Chloe who is going to college next year.  I took her along to initially look at cars and I wanted her to experience the car buying process (good and/or bad). We narrowed our choices to the Mazda3 and the Hyundai Elantra because of the positive ratings, the looks and the MPG of these 2 cars.  We went to a Mazda dealer in the San Fernando Valley close to our home where the salesman showed little interest or enthusiasm in us and barely answered questions we had about the car.  I guess he thought we were not serious about buying.   A couple of weeks later, we went to Oxnard Hyundai because of their good reputation and we knew they had the color of the Elantra we were interested, in stock.  We were greeted warmly by Tony Lee.  He answered all our questions about the Elantra as he is very knowledgeable.  He also made my daughter feel very involved in the process which put us at ease and impressed us both.  We went on a test drive and loved the Elantra.  After some negotiating, we got the car at a very good price.  Steve Curtis in the Finance Dept. was very courteous and great to work with. I was very pleased and impressed that after the papers were signed and the car was prepped and ready to go, Tony Lee spent an additional hour plus with us going over all the features of the Elantra again with my daughter, answering any and all questions.  He made sure she understood everything about the car before we drove off the lot.  My daughter's first car buying experience was a great one which pleased me.

Miguel did not pressure us to buy, but scheduled a meeting with us for the weekend.  Before the meeting, he was very communicative and sent over a lot of information.  On the day I bought my car, I went from looking at an old Toyota Camry to a brand new Hyundai Accent 5-door.  I was sold the instant I drove it, and after a few hours Miguel and his team were able to work with the price I wanted.

Miguel and his team WILL get you the deal you want, and be 100% transparent about what you are actually paying for, and the customer service really makes you feel welcome.

The facilities are also VERY clean, the cleanest my wife and I saw at any dealership in the area.

865,"November 08, 2011","I highly recommend Oxnard Hyundai for your Hyundai purchase/service dealership in the Oxnard, Ventura and Santa Barbara areas. As an experienced new car owner, I have dealt with dozens of dealerships in my lifetime and Oxnard Hyundai is by far the best! I was impressed by their superior knowledge, communication skills, friendliness and many other professional courtesies.

In particular, I want to mention two of their associates: their finance manager, Steve Curtis and JJ Delgado, their service coordinator. Mr. Curtis’ finance counseling approach left me feeling that I was in the hands of a seasoned professional with only my best interests as his highest priority.

Ultimately, their service coordinator, JJ Delgado’s friendliness and shared interest in the best care my car could possibly receive sealed the deal for a long term business relationship with this dealership. He has earned my trust through good communication, openness, honesty, and transparency. JJ always goes above and beyond what you typically expect from a service coordinator. 

Both these gentlemen’s very thorough and ethical approach in overseeing the purchase and servicing of my car provided me a solid foundation of trust and integrity thus affirming my dealership choice was the right one. Will I use them again?  You bet!

However, second visit was absolutely fantastic! Tony Lee was very helpful with everything with buying the car. First, he helped me with getting the &quot;right&quot; car. He went around every possible car under our budget. He gave us all the information we need to find the &quot;right&quot; car. He suggested to buy really nice used car with excellent price and specification. It was unbelievable price for a car that looks like it is new! He also went through steps to evaluate the information we saw in layman's term. The complicated used car process became easier with help of Tony. He suggested good programs that can protect my car.

I went to 15 different dealers the same day around Oxnard, some of them even told me there was nothing they could do for me witch was really disappointing.

 Tony Lee of Oxnard Hyundai was very knowledgeable and helpful and sold me a car that he would have sold to one of his sons, i trusted him and now i am really happy with the car i bought, the finance management was also very nice and they took the time to answer every little question i had about the vehicle.

870,"October 29, 2011","I came in to test drive the new Hyundai Accent.  Dealing with John and Miguel was a pleasure.  

John was very knowledgeable and friendly as he let me take the car for a test.  He also made the process of getting a quote as painless as possible.  

At one point I noticed a used car on the lot was had a great price on it.  In minutes John was ready to let me take it for a test.  His flexibility and willingness to spend time with me made me want to do business with him.  

The management was also willing negotiate on the price, and I ended up with a real deal, under Kelly Blue Book for the vehicle.  

I was planning to pay cash for the car, but they offered me such a good deal on financing that I took their offer.  Also, they've got an excellent warranty service which I also bought.  

I drove off the lot feeling great about the purchase, and would do business with these guys again in a minute. 

I highly recommend the Oxnard Hyundai for your next purchase.  

The only complaint I have is that the map on their website is not correct.  I went to their old location first by mistake when I followed the Google map directions.  They said they have tried to fix it but Google is not cooperating.  If I were them, I'd take the map down, rather than misdirect people.  

Other than that one website glitch, this dealership is excellent!

I went to about 10 dealerships that day, I was about to go home because I couldn't find anything within my price range. Just by chance we happened to drive past this dealership ans noticed a couple of cars priced within my price range. So we pulled in and Tony approached us, I told him what I was looking for. He showed me a beautiful car with leather interior and all the works, and it was within my price range, but had a lot of miles on it. I just figured that was to be expected only having $7,000 to work with. Just as I was bout to leave, another salesmen, John showed us a trade in that was just finishing up getting completely inspected. It was exactly what I was looking for! It was a 2004 ford focus with ONLY 30,000 miles on it! It was within my price range and with zero dents or blemishes! I told them I had to go home and talk with my dad, they were not pushy what so ever. They didn't hammer me about having to come back, which most would. So I came back with my dad the next day and they let me drive it for about 7 miles, showed us the inspection check list and put the car on the lifter to let us look under the car, showed us the car facts. Made it a pleasant process for my dad and I. They knew I was on a budget, so they worked with me and wasn't rude, they were very patient as well. I went home a very happy girl that day with my new car! Not only that, but the car salesmen, John called me the next day to make sure I didn't have any problems with the car, and answered any questions I had. He also let me take it in today becuase I was concerned about the brakes. Turns out the noise of my brakes was because I had parked it on a hill, but on flat road it was fine.

891,"October 09, 2011","We can not thank everyone at Oxnard Hyundai enough for making our car buying experience such a positive and pleasant one.  We did our research with consumer reports and first tried shopping at other dealerships. We found Keyes Hyundai to be problematic, as they tried a bait and switch, offering one thing on the phone and adding unwanted dealer costs and add ons that we did not want, when we visited in person. The people at Ladin Hyundai were nice, but not at all eager to work with the buyers. They added over $1,500 dollars in dealer costs to the sticker price of each car, and stated they could do this,"" because the cars were in high demand,and they couldn't keep them on the lot."" We had very positive dealings with the people at Harbor Hyundai, but once we met the salesmen at Oxnard Hyundai,it was clear that we would buy our car from them. Jim Anderson was very knowledgable, informative, and helpful on the phone when we called to make inquiries. When we came for a visit, Scott Glenn met with us and arranged for us to test drive several vehicles. Scott had answers to all of our questions. He was very patient with us and we particularly appreciated that he did not pressure us or push us to make a hasty decision. Scott was incredible with is follow up phone calls and the hours of effort he put into finding us the ""exact Elantra"" we wanted, with just the right color, interior and features we wanted at the right PRICE. Once we decided to purchase the car, we met Howard Kory, the sales manager. Like Scott and Jim, he was warm and friendly, and made us feel very comfortable and at ease.
Later Jim Curtis helped us with the financing, and again, what is usually a stressful
exercize, was made very pleasant and comfortable by Jim. Unlike those at other dealerships, the people at Oxnard Hyundai made us feel welcome and valued as customers. We love our new Elantra, and have received several follow-up phones calls from Scott to make sure we are happy. The friendly,welcome feeling,the genuine desire to accomodate the customer, and the pressure free approach of the all of men at Oxnard Hyundai, made this the best car buying experience we have EVER had. We would by another car at Oxnard Hyundai, and recommend the fine professionals at this dealership to our family and friends.
Sincerely,
Paula and Gregg Golem",5.0
892,"October 09, 2011","I had researched the car I was interested in online and had also researched the approximate value of my trade in. Yesterday I decided to finally go test drive the new 2012 Hyundai Elantra. I work in Westlake Village and know that the dealerships up there always mark up the cars above MSRP. So imagine my surprise to find out that Oxnard Hyundai does not!  MSRP is what they charge and the cars were flying off the lot yesterday! The car I purchased had just arrived Wednesday. And wow, what a value you get for your $$$.

I worked with Scott Glen and loved that he was straight forward, told me everything and didn't try to hide anything. And he worked with me on my trade in and got me pretty much what I needed in order to buy the car I wanted. Fabulous service and a great personality! And their finance guy Steve was great too. Very helpful and honest which I greatly appreciated!

I HIGHLY recommend Oxnard Hyundai!!  Go OH!!",5.0
893,"October 08, 2011","I highly recommend this dealership. My sales person was Tony Lee, he was good sales person, patient, and most important he did not pressure me to buy. He really explained to me step by step the car's condition and was very relaxed. He gave me time to inspect the car and discuss with my wife about the car and he always gave me time to think.
Actually I went there to follow up the deal with other sales person but the sales person  that I dealt with, could not make me comfortable to buy the car. He could not even answer my question. However, when I went there a week ago, I met with Tony Lee.
From the moment I met him, I felt that he was really good and trust worthy sales person.  He answer all my questions and even he did not know the answer, he always tried to find out the answer just to make me comfortable to buy the car. At last, he made me a great deal that I couldn't refuse and I couldn't find any deal that he gave to me.
Also the day I took the deal, the finance department was really friendly, specially Steve Curtis. He made the paperwork process went quickly and smoothly. He even offered me extended warranty for low price and I think you couldn't find any deal like that in any dealership.
At last, I want to say that this dealership is really good and you should see Tony Lee to make a deal with and he will give a great deal!!!!!",5.0

From the moment I arrived at Oxnard Hyundai everyone was amazing!  I felt right at home!  I went there with only the intention of looking, I have owned 2 hyundais already and knew I was going to buy a car in the future, but of course I fell in love with the 2012 Elantra!  Howard (the manager) and Tony made me an offer that I couldn't refuse! :)  It was exactly what I had wanted!  I must say also that Steve, who worked in finance, was very nice to work with, he made the paperwork process go by quickly and smoothly!  He was so easy going, as was everyone there!  Howard is definitely doing something right because everyone that works there seems so happy and out going!  
The day I bought my car, I had gone to another dealership (actually the one that I had bought my last Hyundai from) and I felt so ignored... my boyfriend offered to find another dealership in the area and I'm so glad he did... I called to see what they had, and drove in just to look and drove out very happy with my new car!  All in all I must say it turned out to be a GREAT DAY! ",5.0

899,"September 25, 2011","Salesman, Bill Moeschler was very knowledgeable and helpful.  We went to other dealerships and came back because of his honesty and straightforward explanations.  He explained that this dealership was special and not like other dealerships.  The dealer did not have huge special mark up prices, as we saw when we went shopping around.  Most pricing was at MSRP.
Bill was a pleasure to work with and took time to explain everything and not pushy.  We enjoyed his professional approach and was quite charming.",5.0

He is a superb representative of a real classy operation. No hard sell. No high-low ball dealing. Just straightforward, honesty. What they say is what they do. They made purchasing my Genesis painless. It would be hard not to go back to them when I need another car. They have definitely gained a happy, and probably, repeat customer! Thanks Omar.
