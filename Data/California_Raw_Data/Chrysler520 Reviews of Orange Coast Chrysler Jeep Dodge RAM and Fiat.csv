3,"May 15, 2020","Just ok
very average, nothing special that you couldn’t find anywhere else at a much lower price, the labor per hour is stupid expensive and the parts are marked up some
Only use them for my warranty/recall issues and oil changes which comes with detailed inspection and suggestion report which I take to another place that costs a lot less to repair 
Staff are ok, they’re just trying to do their jobs 
Overall you can find more economical spot that will give your same results ",2.0

114,"August 24, 2019","I bought my Dodge Charger at your dealership. After my bad experience with your service dept. You have lost a customer for life!! And I am in the market to purchase a Dodge Challenger scatpack not from Orange coast now. It took 4 hours to do simple maintenance oil change and tire rotation. 3 hours into my waiting. I approached German Moreno service jerk. He didn’t care, I took a picture of his name tag and he said I couldn’t do that and then he challenged me in front of your service staff including Ferdie your service manager. I said are you challenging me a paying customer who bought his car here. Freddie had to tell this jerk three times to leave the service area. I was just checking 3 hours into my service what was happening with my basic service? Freddie told me that German was having a bad day.  Wow really!! Threatening customers. Lonna Love was terrible & uncaring about Me the customer also. This poor service starts at the top!! Orange coast management and service department. You have lost a valued customer. But I am sure that no one there cares about the customer. Wait until this happens to more customers and you go out of business. Maybe then Orange Coast Dodge will care. I expect at least a phone call from Jeff Peters or management. You have lost another customer I can go elsewhere for my new purchase and service. I was embarrassed by German Moreno, Lonna Love and your entire terrible service team. I will never return unless I hear from your management About this ridiculous treatment from your service staff.",1.2

117,"August 14, 2019","I arrived early at 7am when the dealership opened to service my Jeep and there were 4 cars a head of me.  It seemed like they were not prepared and had no communication with each other because the guy that asked what service I needed stated they didn’t have any service cards and to just go in to request my service. When I spoke to the advisor she asked for me to go outside to get the service card And I had to explain what the previous person advised me.  She didn’t even have her name on the paperwork it was another guy who didn’t even help me.  For a simple oil change and tire rotation I took 4 hours to complete.  I didn’t get any updates while I was waiting in the lobby.  I had to ask 3 times the status and each time I asked they would say it was almost done and they needed 10 more minutes. Well those 10 minutes turned in 4 hours cuz They completed the service at 11:30 am.  I even had to ask if there was any recommended service still needed. Another service agent had to look it up and stated oh yes filters can be replaced.  I was frustrated because it was 4 hours of waiting and they didn’t bother to tell me the recommended filter change.  5 people that came in after me were able to get their service done with in 1 hour of their arrival and I saw they were getting updates. Were I had to ask several times if my car was almost finished,  Very bad customer service experience. I have visited this dealership a few other times and had a great experience, but this is my first time experiencing this bad of a service, I’m not sure if it’s a new group of service agents but they were the worst I’ve dealt with.  I’m not sure if I will go back or try another dealership to compare.  ",2.8
118,"August 14, 2019","Service department is a disappointment. German at the front counter talks a good talk. He told me I needed my air conditioning filter replace when I came in for a oil change. Additional $75 . I almost fell for it, my car is only 24 k miles and I just bought it used a few months back. I asked him how often do you need that replaced . He said about every 15 k miles and they probably didn't replace it for me at the other place . I asked him how does he know I need one now? (Since I just walked in the door and no one has looked at my car ) He said, oh the mileage tells me. After that I said, take it off my order. I made an appointment at 9 am and after that he said it would take an hour and half . It's been 2 hours , I asked how much longer and he said Another 30 min. Coincidentally I have to wait longer than everyone else for a simple oil change.",1.8

Over 3 days I had to call 7 times to get 1 update on my truck. Out of the 7 times 1 I actually got a hold of Tony. The Service advisor didn’t know one of the techs went home sick until the end of the day, which made my truck stay another day, no work was done to it on the second day. It took 3 days to do oil change, 3 recalls, program the infotainment system, and squeaking breaks. I got my truck back dirty with smudges and dust all over the interior, and to top it off I got the usual ""we can't duplicate the problem"", (breaks squeaking) that started happening 10 min after I left the dealer. When I asked how long they drive my truck for this issue I was told we can’t spend all day driving to hear squeaking breaks. Absolutely unacceptable. I sent an email to dodge corporate with the details of how bad of an experience I had but I have yet to hear back.

145,"June 19, 2019","After extensive correspondence back and forth with their Online Sales representative, I thought the final price was settled and agreed upon. Originally the sales person quoted me at $923 for DMV fees, which meant they were calculating this 60k truck as if it cost over 150k. I thought this was insane so I used the DMV calculator from the official DMV website to double check and they were indeed up-charging like crazy.  I let him know that as a non-resident, active duty military I would be waved from some fees. Salesman came back with $110 for DMV fees. Sounded good.  When I visited the dealership and it was time to sign all the documents with their finance guy, they changed the sales tax because it was ""miscalculated"". Even though the salesman acknowledged my zip code multiple times in our emails. This I could accept because I didn’t expect them to pay it for me. I signed all the documents and called it a day. About 3 weeks later I get a text from the same finance guy demanding an additional $338 for DMV fees, after going back and forth trying to understand why I would absorb their mistakes, he threatens me with his office manager calling my commanding officer to collect the money. This is incredibly illegal and plain unethical and unprofessional. I then resulted to having the Base Legal Office get involved and rectify. Ultimately, after Legal got involved they accepted their own mistakes. 
Hypothetically speaking, these people could quote you $1 for certain fees and then threaten and demand different amounts. That’s pretty vile.

I was called back & credited with a FREE oil change on my next visit.

He told me that a rental was just turned in. What a coincidence! I left my car and took the rental. I explained that I bought an extra package from finance to cover any scratches on my Jeep. Of course he had never heard of it but would look into it. I returned to get my Jeep. They had detailed my Jeep but the scratches were still there. I was told to go out to the waiting room and they would bring my Jeep up in a couple of minutes. I waited over 30 minutes  for them to bring my car to me.

182,"April 03, 2019","I recently brought my 2015 Jeep Wrangler in for service and received outstanding service from Paul. I needed to replace my battery and have a noise issue examined.  I felt my vehicle received excellent care. I appreciated Paul's attention to detail, mindfulness, and exceptional customer service.  I was recently involved in a collision where i was not at fault. As a result of the collision, my car had an air leak in one of the seals.  I had narrowed down the location, but was uncertain of the cause (bad seal, door out of alignment, etc).  With assistance from the Service Team, he was able to confirm the location of the issue with a visual inspection and helped save me from the full diagnostic fee. He also provided me with a path forward so I knew what needed to be fixed at the body shop (door alignment). The experience with him was much better than at the repair shop.

They were willing to hold the truck overnight while I thought about it and reviewed the numbers.  All of the pricing was fair and Max went through the numbers with me so I fully understood each of the line items.  There was nothing hidden in the price from what was advertised online.  This was one of the easiest car-buying experiences I ever had and I could not be happier with my purchase.

230,"November 15, 2018","I had been looking around for the new 2019 Ram Rebel and on a RAM truck message forum (5thgenrams.com), I was referred to Max B as another local forum member just picked up a Laramie trim from Max.

This dealership had tons of Rebels compared to other dealers who had little to none. So I figured they have the most inventory means they know how to get one for me??

So I call Max B. and introduce myself and tell him that I was referred by a forum member.

1st red flag - Max did not care about the referral or his deal - he just wanted to sell me a truck. Max was offended when I told him that of the 35 Ram Rebels in stock that I could not pick one.

So he asks some questions and I give him answers.
I offered to send a build sheet from the Ram website so that he can look for an incoming Rebel that met my needs. 
I email him my build sheet and he calls back and starts to ask questions on package options and such.

2nd red flag - Max arrogantly states that a 3.6L engine (base) can not be had on a Rebel and never will be. That was a lie - there were a couple of 3.6L Rebels popping up in San Diego and Lake Elsinore using the Ram truck locator.  I could tell Max wanted me to just take a truck off their lot and forgo looking for a 3.6L engine.  I felt that Max was lazy and didn't want to pick up his fingers to locate an incoming or find a factory order D1 or KZ status.

3rd red flag - Max says why get a V6 engine when a REAL MAN drives a V8 Hemi. I try to explain that I am not going to haul, not going to tow, and need the truck as a daily driver. 

Max making that sexist remark is unheard of these days unless he came from a trailer trash area of Georgia.

4th red flag - Max would not tell me which is more affordable to lease on a Rebel when we started to talk about numbers.  He just said he has no idea about residuals and money factors.  Huge mistake - all salespeople are taught to give out base numbers when a customers asks - how do they close a customer ???

5th red flag - Max laughs at me when I try to change over to a Big Horn trim with a 3.6L engine and says that a special order will take 6-8 weeks. That was a lie - there were tons of dealers receiving Big Horns with base 3.6L engines. As a matter of fact I just test drove the Big Horn at an Anaheim dealer 2 weeks prior.

6th red flag - When asked about special ordering, Max immediately changed his superior attitude to that of condescending.  Max did not want to do a special order because it means he would have to work.  I could tell Max wanted to sell a truck to me now - not in 6-8 weeks for a special order.  How a car dealership survives without having some of their sales on a custom order is beyond me.

Do NOT do business with this person or dealer - he will lie thru his teeth to get you into any car they have.  
Max lacks basic customer service skills, no knowledge of financial numbers, will berate you if you want a special order, and make sexist remarks.  
Beware females who are independent - Max will rub you the wrong way as he did to me.",1.0

261,"August 14, 2018","This was the first time taking my Jeep in for service at this dealer. The first woman who greeted me at my vehicle did not seem like she wanted to be there. She gave me a ticket and said go to Kelsey’s desk. Kelsey did not wear a name tag, nor is her desk marked, so how am i to know who Kelsey is? She checked me in and said the wait would be no longer than 1.5 hours for an oil change. After two hours of waiting, i went to her desk. No one acknowledged my existence while i waited for Kelsey. I had to ask someone where she was and found out she went home for the day. Sure enough, my car was done, but no one let me know! I had somewhere to be after my appointment and didn’t make it there, unfortunately. No one was really friendly and didn’t seem like they enjoyed their job. It was kind of a downer to be there.

 In addition, i called 4 times to move my appointment back by 20 minutes and got hung up on every single time. So irritating! I was told by a manager their phone lines have been acting strange for a year. Needless to say, i am not very impressed by anyone at this service dealer. I will be finding somewhere else to take my car for a simple oil change.",2.8

After reading all of these great reviews of this dealership I was hoping to have a good day.  I dealt with Max, seems very friendly at first and was quick to write you up for the advertised price to make you happy, but after a while he makes you feel as if your wasting his time and was very condescending. 

After going back to the finance guy, they sneak a lot of things to add up the cost which I did not want, was not negotiated and he was not willing to take off. Also he was not aware of the price that was negotiated upfront. Somehow they were trying to sell me the vehicle at two different prices and clearly not on the same page in the upfront price with Max. I saw the red flag in their fishy process and all they were doing is playing games to con me. The nice discounted price disappeared. All he did was lower my monthly to make me happy since they did not budge on the net cost, but up their interest rate to 8.9%!!  I have excellent credit and should not pay their outrageous rates! As I was walking out, customers were upset in the waiting area. I am just glad I left and purchased elsewhere.

BUYER BEWARE...Wow. Just wow. Worst experience ever. they did a bait and switch on the APR. Told me I should qualify for 3% interest on the loan. I agreed to come drive the car. I agrree to buy it and work out my trade in. Everythings great so far. Then after he runs my credit he LIES and says I don't qualify for ANY purchase loan and cannot buy the car. BUT he can offer me a lease a 8%... bait and switch. BUT it gets worse. I decline and leave... and sure enough the next day a DIFFERENT salesman contacts me and states he CAN get me the 3%. I respond anything over is unacceptable, but if you can really get me under 4%, I'll still buy the car. He comes back and offers 5.5%... They had my credit history PRIOR to running my credit. Then told me 3%. Then no deal but a horrible lease deal. Then magically the next day he can't swing 3% but can get me a loan for 5.5%. How does it go the night before from NO DEAL you are screwed... to 5.5 % the next day? How? Because they commit lender fraud and try and make you love the car, commit to buy, then state the only deal they can give you is HORRIBLE. IF you won't take the bad lease, they will send you home. Then they finally make a REAL effort for the loan, you grab the 5.5% and they get a kick back from the lender. I'm contacting Chrysler, the state of CA, the BBB and speaking with an attorney. I was smart and got the entire exchange in writing via email and the attorney confirmed they did a blantant bait and switch. Buyer beware and do ALL negotiating via email.

335,"November 02, 2017","On 10-22-17 I went to this dealer because I wanted a Ram 2500 4x4 diesel. The first contact was good and when I arrived I met with Rod Mullar. I drove the truck and decided it was the one for me. The price was good and the trade in value was much better than the other dealer locally offered. The problem was the add-ons that were forced upon me. $299 for an anti theft device that I told them at least 5 times that I didn't want. I was told that they would have to charge me to remove it so I might as well just buy it. I knew this wasn't true but I was tired of going back and forth about $299 while I'm spending $65,500. The next thing was nitro fill which is nitrogen filled tires and a ""membership'' to get your tires filled at any nitro fill dealer for $179!! Problem is I need to change air pressure based on the load on the truck and I am not going to drive 30 minutes to the closest nitro fill location. I again told them I didn't want it and was told it was already it the tires and they can't remove it. So $478 in things I told them I didn't want and they just refused to remove. The worst part was on 10-24-17 I took my son to daycare and when I went back out to my new truck it wouldn't start. After trying to start it for 20 minutes I got out and was about to get an uber since I needed to get to work, when luckily I tired the remote start and it started. I was able to use this work around get home. I called the dealer and was told I'd receive a call back about it. On 10-30-17 I had enough and took it to my local dealer because it was not starting with the push to start button still. I got a phone call on 11-1-17 from the local dealer that the dealer install Anti theft device was causing it not to start. They bypassed it (obviously not all that great of an anti theft) and it started fine. I then called Rod to find out if they were going to pay the $220 that I was going to be charged to remove it. Rod apparently called the company that installed the anti theft device and they did come to my local dealer and remove it. I still never received a call back from Rod about my concern about the refund for the anti theft since not only did I not ever want it, it now caused me to be without my truck for 2 days and it had to be removed. I will never understand the thought process of losing a customer that has bought 9 vehicles in the past 5 years for less than $500.",2.8
336,"September 13, 2017","I initially gave them 5 stars, but they messed up BIG. Unfortunately, the service contract that I purchased was misrepresented to me by Michael ""B -something- ian"" in the Finance Department and I had to edit my review. The service contract was supposed to cover the cost of all my oil changes and when I took it in for service I had to pay roughly $56 to get the service completed and get my car back. The service plan cost me $1,300 at Orange Coast ($56 (14) + 1300 = $2084). So let me break down the numbers, $56 multiplied by 14 -oil changes- on top of the $1300 I paid for the service plan. Compare $2084 at Orange Coast to $585 at Glenn E. Thomas. I have canceled my service contract through Orange Coast and will repurchase it through Glenn E. Thomas Jeep in Long Beach (Cherry/Spring off 405) which is only a couple miles from where I live and well worth the drive for an estimated savings of $1,500. The service plan only costs $585 for my vehicle at Glenn E. Thomas Jeep and it covers synthetic 100%; about 25% of the cost of doing business through Orange Coast Jeep. I will never do business with Orange Coast again. They rip you off with a smile. Orange Coast Jeep sold me a service contract that only covered conventional oil when my vehicle requires synthetic at $1,300 which I cancelled and then repurchased at Glenn E. Thomas for $585 that covers synthetic. If you experienced this, you can go into any Jeep location as I did and cancel then repurchase a contract somewhere else. They lost my business for life. If they tell you they don't handle cancellations that's misleading because I called Mopar and that's the guidance I received and when I went in and explained everything to another dealer they were happy to cancel their contract when I clearly expressed that I would repurchase it once it cleared. I was sent a check pretty quick for the refund. They messed up because this post will have an immeasurable impact on their sales. You don't do that to individuals that work hard for what they have.

Thank you, Richard for making our car purchase simple and seamless.

Jeff Peters (Service Manager) made a wrong right with a phone call to apologize and to resolve the issues.  Jeff Peters provided me with excellent customer service and scheduled a time to have my car serviced  to resolve the airbag fault.  Jeff Peters also explained the process of the ""important safety recall"" Chrysler is currently sorting out.  I would like to thank Jeff for taking the time and listening to my concerns.  The service department promptly resolved the air bag issue. The time it took me to sign paper work and driving off in the loaner car was 10 min tops.  My car was fix same day!

392,"January 08, 2016","Wife and I purchased a 2016 Ram 1500 from Orange Coast this week. I dealt with Chris Ramsey - Internet Sales Manager. 

Everything but paperwork signing and delivery he did via email and occasional phone call. 
It was the best vehicle purchasing experience we have had to date. Due to past experiences, I could not believe our luck while waiting for the other shoe to drop. Everything Chris told us was true and correct. No gotchas, surprises or BS. 

The finance department was also a very pleasant experience. Yes the customary offers of add ons are made but zero pressure. We were treated well and respectfully. Overall we found the office staff friendly.

Two other Dodge dealers could not locate the truck we needed and expected us to make unacceptable compromises. We did not want the Hemi nor the longer crew cab truck. 

On very first email contact, Chris located the exact truck we wanted down to the last option (rear axle, optional fuel tank, etc). He sent PDF of that truck's factory window sticker showing that it had every single item we wanted. It was equivalent to a factory order without the wait. How did he locate it within  minutes when other dealers could not ?  They use the same Dodge search engines.

As I later found out, Chris is totally committed to the customer's needs. I can say this because with another dealership, when pushed they ""suddenly found"" the very same truck Chris offered me and for $1k more, same truck!  What this tells me is that the other dealers had no real interest in meeting my needs.

Chris dispatched the Orange Coast vehicle carrier and had our truck delivered within days without adding a single mile on it. At delivery, Chris covered all the features, answered all my questions and at our request skipped ACCESS stuff we have zero interest in, you guessed it  we are seniors.",5.0

First I went to Ford for the Explorer XLT 4x4. I was very clear on the must have's and options I can live with/without. I loved it and was quoted a price on the package I wanted and then he realized it would have to be custom order and kept trying to sell me things i didn't want. He finally placed the order on the one I asked for and forgot to add two features i wanted and then quoted one price and it was a ""BIG"" price difference later, so I left Ford.

Then to Cadillac and GMC. Went to look at the SUV's. Not at all interested in the Terrain or Acadia but he kept trying to sell me the Yukon Denali. I told him I would love to have it, are you paying the $52,000 for it? He didn't like that response for it. After that I was giving up but then decided to look at Dodge and Jeep.

Went to Orange Coast Jeep In Costa Mesa. Was referred to Kenny Smirz. I told him EXACTLY what I wanted, where my payments needed to be and I showed up later that day. He had the perfect Jeep Cherokee Limited 4x4, all white with chrome and every bell and whistle. it was like a spaceship. I asked about the black out package and he then showed me the Jeep Altitude that is exactly the same as the Grand Cherokee but with the black out package. I fell in love.

Kenny was so attentive to what I wanted and everything he promised he delivered. He made sure I was well taken care of and never pushed me off on anyone else. Kenny is the Sales Manger and he took great care of me. He was never too busy for me. 

So needless to say, We made a deal. Kenny gave me the BEST deal and zero out of pocket, across the board trade in on my 2013 Ford Edge. My payments are exactly the same as before and I have a brand new Jeep. Thank you Kenny Smirz and Orange Coast Jeep, Costa Mesa.

I also added the tire rotation/oil change/car wash package for $10 a month. Can't go wrong with that. Lori in the finance department was super sweet and explained everything to me. Wilie made sure i knew how to actually navigate the car once i was driving away. What a great team.

409,"October 24, 2015","I made an appointment to get an oil change, and to have a couple of TSBs performed on my 2014 Grand Cherokee EcoDiesel. As part of my extended warranty, I requested a rental car if they were going to have it overnight.  Came in for my appointment this past Tuesday at 7:00AM and was helped by Lonna, an Asst. Service Mgr.  She found my service request in the system, and checked with me as to the reason for this visit.  She then looked up all other applicable TSBs, explained each one to me and advised they also be performed.  As I'd already looked up these TSBs on the web and knew what each was, I had no other questions at the time.  She said they would need it overnight, and that I had requested a rental car paid for under warranty.  She explained that Enterprise car rental was just a couple of doors down the street, and they would send someone up to pick me up.  After printing out the service ticket, I was picked up within 10 minutes, signed out a rental and was on my way to work.

At around 8:20 the next morning, Lonna called to let me know that my Jeep was repaired and I could pick it up any time. After work, I returned the rental car and Enterprise brought me back to the dealership.  Lonna explained all TSBs that were performed (including replacing the catalytic converter and re-flashing the transmission control module), and we discussed the diesel exhaust fluid issue I had and her recommendation as to how often to add new fluid.  I turned in a copy of the rental car receipt (previously charged to the dealership as a warranty rental), paid for the oil change, signed off on the paperwork and was on my way.

Bottom line is, they were professional in taking my initial phone call, and the appointment to drop it off was fairly quick even thorough Lonna explained each of the 8 TSBs that would be performed (two of which pertained to my reason for bringing the vehicle in).  The rental car process was handled efficiently and effortlessly.  The dealership performed the work quickly and had the 2 parts kits on hand for the warranty repairs.  Lonna was great to work with, courteous and professionally competent.  I'll definitely contact her again for my Jeep's service requirements.",5.0

I called a few other places and did not like the service or the run around I was getting. I called OC Chrysler, Jeep, Dodge and got through to Garrett. What a seamless process. What really made everything so smooth was that he knows the inventory like the back of his hand. This will save you hours as a consumer. I had a basic idea of what kind of Jeep Wrangler I wanted to buy but wasn't sure about all the extras and options. Garrett, knew exactly what model came with what, and all of the details. He helped me to decide on what I wanted and then we didn't have any long drawn out negotiation. He gave me a great price and texted me a photo. Bada Bing, done! He was so nice, and easy to work with. I can't say enough good things. I did everything over the phone, online, and text with Garrett. I called and pre-arranged my financing in advance through my credit union. When I arrived the car was up in front, they had just had it detailed and added a full tank of gas. Financing was super easy because I had pre-arranged in advance, but Lori in finance asked me if I wanted to try and get a lower rate. Within minutes she found me a lower rate then what I had.

439,"October 15, 2014","Stay away from these guys, COMPLETE DIRT BAGS!!!! My problem started over a month ago when I contacted these guys about a new Jeep Rubicon X. I was emailed back by a sales person named Garrett. He informed me he could give me 1k off sticker. I politley thanked him and said, I could get at least 3k off sticker at several other dealerships, at which point he became beligerant and typed back in all CAPS. I have purchased 4 different vehciles from this dealership in the past and forwarded his emails to the owner of Orange Coast, Jon Gray. I had his email from him thaking me for my prior purchases. Mr. Gray responded back saying that Garret's conduct was unprofessional and said that it was not indicative of his employees attitudes. I accepted his apology and he got me in touch with a new ""Salesperson"" named Ken. Ken assured me that I would be getting 4k off the sticker of the vehicle to make up for the service, which I thought was great.

It started out just fine. I was going to use OC Motorsports to build the jeep and we were going to wrap some of the cost of the lift into the financing. It took almost 2 weeks for the lift and pricing to be finalized through OC motorsports (Partly my fault since we priced out several different suspension packages). During that time they sold the vehicle they had quoted me on. When I inquired when they could get me another, Ken said yes, but now my discount would only be 2k as it was a new model year (Had I known that I would have been down at the dealership day one). The classic 1990's used car salesman bait and switch!!!! At this point I wasn't happy,  but I wanted to see where the numbers landed. Ken had all of a sudden dissapeared and wouldnt return my emails. After my third email he ""Apologized"" that he had been busy with end of the month (Like he couldnt shoot me a 2 line email letting me know that"" and said he would have my numbers shortly. 

Two days later I get an email, not from Ken, but from the original rude and inept sales person ""Garrett"". There was nothing written in the body of the email, just a screen shot of their computer screen showing a montlhy payment that was $140 higher a month with an additional $1500 down payment. Ken didnt even have the decency to send the email himself to explain why the down payment and monthly payment was substantially higher. This is one of the most unprofessional, classless transactions I have ever been a part of!

I have purchased over 23 new vehicles since 1994. I have never been treated with such contempt or indifference. I have purchased 4 different vehicles from this dealership, so to say I have been loyal to them is an understatement. I bought my 2014 Grand Cherokee SRT8 from Poway Jeep because Orange Coast wouldnt return my emails in a timley manner (Never contacted the owner on this issue). This dealerships service and employees are sub par and define why the general public cant stand the buying process. Buyer beware, absolutley an untrustworthy dealership!!!!!!!!!!",1.0

442,"April 07, 2014","After several test drives of 09 Mazda5 at 4 other dealers, I went to Orange Coast Chrysler Jeep Dodge dealer to test drive one that they had advertised.  I spoke with the Sales Manager-Howard.  I explained to him that the price was fair but that I had seen another for approximately $400.00 less.  I told him that if he was willing to match it and address a ""check tire"" light and a grinding sound that I believed to be a suspension issue, then I would buy the car.  Howard explained to me that all their used cars have been inspected and are approved to be sold.  Nonetheless, he agreed to have the car looked at by the local Mazda dealer.  He specifically told me that a Mazda Mechanic would drive the car and make the repairs needed to correct the problem.  The following day I called Howard to confirm that the car had been repaired.  Howard told me that the car was still at the Mazda dealer but that it should be ready by the time I arrived.  Eventually I picked up the car.  About 15 minutes into my drive home the check engine light went on.  I immediately called Howard to inform him about the light (upon getting of the freeway I started to notice the sound in the suspension).  Howard told me that the car had been checked out and driven by the Mazda mechanic and that ""Leonard"" from the Mazda dealer told him that they had rectified the problem.  Howard told me that he would call me later to give me instructions as to what to do to have the problem addressed.  The next day I called Howard at the Mazda dealer following Howard's instructions.  Leonard told me that he was never told to test drive the car.  Furthermore, he told me that he was simply told to reset the computer in the car.  I relayed this information to Howard.  All he could say was that there must have been some sort of miscommunication.  Initially Howard agreed to correct the problems but then told me that he had given me such a great price that he didn't know if they had room to pay for the repairs.  I told Howard that I was willing to have the car inspected by my regular mechanic because I felt his prices would be more reasonable than that of the Mazda dealer.  After talking to his used car Manager Howard agreed.  My Mechanic inspected the car and wrote and estimate of the repairs.  Howard agreed that the repair cost was fair and would get back to me to arrange repairs.  The next day Howard told me they were only obligated to make repairs to the light issue because it was a safety issue.  Repairs to the suspension would be my problem.  I explained to Howard that quite frankly that was mildly interesting to me.  He had told me that the repairs had been done prior to picking up the car; Howard clearly lied.  Howard told me that they were willing to pay $200 to repair the problem with the light or to spend it any way I wished to.  He also gave me the option of returning the car back.  I told him I would call him back the next day with my decision.  The next day I told him I was returning the car.  Howard then told me that was not an option.  I told Howard we would be resolving the cost in court.  Howard told me that they have their attorneys ready for court.  A day or so later Howard called me willing to pay me $600 (total cost was $643.27) for the repairs. I paid for the repairs up front just as they asked me to and faxed them a copy of the bill.  I asked him to call me to confirm that he received the fax.  He did not.  I asked Howard assured me that the check would be sent that same day first class mail.  Thirteen days later and after several calls and voice mails, no check.  I eventually called Orange Coast (accounts payable) to inquire about the check.  They were quick to address my concerns and I informed me that the check had been sent out to my mechanic.  Clearly the miscommunication  and deception from the ""Sales Manager"" need to be addressed.  Howard at Orange Coast Chrysler Jeep Dodge is the epitome of a car salesman.  ",2.4

449,"December 22, 2012","Simply a breath of fresh air - when it comes to buying a new car. I bought a new Dodge Dart Limited here (first baby as a result of the Fiat/Chrysler Group marriage) - and I can honestly say that it was one of the least painful buying experiences I've ever seen. Specifically looking for the Dart, I came to Dodge in Capo after reading a lot of these reviews, actually. And they were spot on. Negotiating a fair price wasn't the hours long process that it usually is...they are pretty much honest and straight forward with things. They don't want to waste time, and they don't want to waste your time. That's very, very rare when purchasing a vehicle.

The car tech/spec guy (a salesman doesn't accompany you on your test drive) was honest and thorough about features - including what MPG you'd REALLY expect from the vehicles, which is always a little less than what's on the sticker, of course. 

They really stress your satisfaction - apparent even when coming back for a second test drive. They literally handed my the keys and said: ""Take it out for as long as you want, we want to make sure this is the right vehicle for you."" And without any employee from the dealership at that (after it was apparent that I was a serious buyer, that is). 

They introduce you to service people, answer every question they can about costs and little details - to the best of their ability.

When the car with my exact specifications (or close) wasn't in stock, they didn't try and sell me a car with the higher price tag - no pressure whatsoever. In fact, they even recommended ordering a custom car from the factory to save me a few thousand bucks while still getting the features I wanted.

Without getting into too many details: They searched for one that was close at other dealerships (to swap so they could fulfill my preferences), thought they found one, that fell through (not their fault), then found one with even more features than I needed and went out of their way to make the numbers work for my original parameters on payments.

They're honest about pricing, incentives for purchasing (and were straight forward about when incentives come through as they make sense for the Chrysler group), etc.

Super chill team of folks to work with, who, as a team, want to make you happy, while generally not screwing you over.

Of course, every business is there to make money - that's to be expected. As long as you know where you want to be in regards to payment, the push is DEFINITELY not even close to as painful and unbearable as a normal dealership - by far.


Fred and Paul were awesome to work with: they try to make things convenient and even will start processes over the phone to cut down on time wasted at the dealership. 

Super chill group of folks and the best buying experience for a car I've had.

As a Mercedes owner for many years I decided to look at the various models available, BMW, Rang Rover and Mercedes and I finally decided to purchase a 2013 SRT 8 Jeep.

I've been through several car buying experiences before, and this one was -- by far -- the easiest.  

Purchased a 2013 Dodge Challenger from Daryl last week.  He answered all of my questions about the car, and really made me feel comfortable during the whole process.  

After purchasing the car, Daryl literally went through every feature of the car -- literally every feature. He really goes out of his way to ensure you are going to be comfortable in your new purchase, and how to maximize the fun you'll be having in your new car.  Daryl also took the time to not only walk me over to the Service and Parts department, but to introduce me to the team over there as well.  It felt good to know that when service needs arise, I'll already know who to turn to.

Daryl then turned me over to Julie in finance to process all of the paper work, and to go over protection options.  She really was easy to work with, and will really ensure you get everything you need, at a fair price.  

My advice to everyone would be to do your research as you can before you get there.  Figure out how much you can spend, what car you want, etc... The more prepared you are, the easier the entire process will be.  Most importantly, just relax and get down to Orange Coast and know that you are in good hands.

At the end of the day, Daryl, Julie in finance, and everyone else at Orange Coast Dodge does an outstanding job, and needs praise for their work.  I would be hard pressed to recommend anyone else for your auto purchasing needs.",5.0

457,"July 22, 2012","My experience with this dealership was one of the more unpleasant experiences in recent memory.  The sales people were flat out dishonest.  One quoted me a price more then $2000 higher than the price they listed on their website for that same vehicle.  When I pointed it out they claimed it was an error so I gave them another shot.  When I went back in, however, the vehicle online had been ""sold"" and they claimed there was only vehicle in the entire region that would fit my needs.  5 minutes, a google search, and phone call later I found a similar vehicle (grand cherokee overland, black, 4x4) down the street for $3000 less than this place quoted me.  Also, at least one product specialist couldn't even answer simple questions about the vehicle.  In sum, I was very disappointed with their business practices and would not recommend them to anyone.

466,"May 31, 2012","In May 2012, I found the exact Chrysler Town & Country Touring, in the exact color we wanted on autotrader that was advertised by Orange Coast Chrysler on Harbor in Costa Mesa, CA.  

I then inquired about the vehicle through the autotrader website and got an autoresponder from a sales person.  Since it was late at night, I did not get a call back.  At 10 am the next day, I called in and Brian Cole answered and he was pretty much the easiest person to work with from then on out.  

Brian had all the paperwork ready for me within a couple of hours, but my wife wanted to sleep on it, so the next day we went in and the car and Brian were waiting for us at our convenience.  Brian even came in 5 hours before his shift started to do the deal.  

We drove away with the same vehicle we saw online with a fantastic lease as advertised AND we got a fair trade in value for our 2003 T&C.  My wife and I have been happy ever since.  

I would also like to thank Lisa Johnston and Pete Shaver for their excellent follow-up and follow through.  Lastly, I would like to thank Fiat for pumping new life into the classic Chrysler brand.

Oh, and also I am Very happy that they re-opened the fledgling Chrysler dealership right next to my home in San Juan Capistrano where I can easily go for any service issues.  Although, I probably will go back to Costa Mesa because I like them so much there.

I have to call them and see what the deal is because surely, I would have heard some than by now. But low and behold the power of the finance manager a man who is extremely rude, says it has not been financed and do you have a co-signer, or more money down. I said no, you are the ones telling me everything is going to be good. Well then he wants me to return the vehicle after they delivered it to me and have my down payment.

470,"March 27, 2012","I purchased a 2011 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon in November of 2011. After two months had passed I still had not recieved registration, tags, or a license plate.  When I called in February to find out what was happening I was told that November was a busy month and not to worry, my license and tags would be coming. When March arrived I called again and  was told to talk to Alicia the DMV girl but every phone call to her resulted in a message on her machine and not one time in a weeks period did I receive a return call. In complete frustration I went to the DMV and was informed that the car was owned by a woman and they would not give me her name. The next day I called to the dealership and  was unable to get David Reed, Alicia or Brian Cole to answer there phones. When I asked to be transferred to the General Manager Pete Shaver the operator patched me in on his cell phone and I told him my worries and that I needed to find out who owned my car, that I had already paid over 35,000 dollars for. When he called me back the following day he said the DMV girl had accidently sent the pink slip to the woman who they had repossesed the car from.  He assured me that going to the DMV in two weeks he would straighten out the problem. After two more weeks I attempted to find out the situation and was told it might be easier for me to just go the DMV myself and take care of it. But then Pete Shaver said if I wanted he would at least get me the license plates. Well now it is March 27 and I finally recieved my pink slip,registration, tags but still no license plate even tho my pink and registration have a plate number on them. When I attempted to contact them again the exact same thing, message machine and no return calls, when I called the Jeep factory complaint line I was told to go to the DMV  myself and report the plates stolen and just get new plates myself, of course at my own cost. The amazing thing is that Jeep themselves don't care and told me there was nothing they could do and they did not want to talk to Orange Coast Jeep about this. I am wondering if there is some sort of legal issues involving this dealership and the rules of business involving the DMV. I am sure this letter will just be removed and discarded, because not one person I have talked to at this dealership or at the Jeep factory has ever wanted to actually do the job they are paid to do. I can promise you I will never buy another Jeep from any dealer, I am 55 years old and have bought many cars, Toyota, Ford, Chevrolet, and others and I have never experienced anything as horrible as the experience at this dealer.

477,"January 23, 2012","Over the past 4 years I have had horrible experiences with car dealerships.  Having not the best credit I had to settle for shoddy dealership, bad cars and terrible staff who took it upon themselves to take advantage of me and my less than perfect credit.  Even though I needed a vehicle badly, I was very reluctant to go anywhere near a dealership, especially a used car dealership.  

Well as fate would have it I recieved an invitation to visit Orange Coast Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep.  

Right away I was treated with respect, friendliness and honesty.  Everyone who works there took the time to say ""Hi"" even if they were just passing by.

The respect and friendliness was awesome, but the honesty threw me for a loop.  Everything I was told and I mean everything was spot on.  The gentleman I worked with was smart, funny, down to earth and HONEST.  He didn't run me around the block and it was very refreshing.  What really amazed me is that the following day when I came back with my wife, he remembered things I had mentioned the day before; for example I told him that my wife didn't like a particular car and he said to her, "" well I know you don't like....""  Most people at car dealerships don't even remember your name.  I can't tell you how many salesman I've worked with at other dealers would ask my name, not even five minutes after the introduction.

The dealership was busy and I spent quite a bit of time there and I can see why.  They are helping people and they're doing it right.  Thanks to Jerry Fontaine and all the staff.

479,"October 04, 2011","As far as buying a new vehicle they were great to deal with. None of the usual sales tactics with Tommy Jackson. Would buy from him again. Having said that, though, I would NEVER purchase anything from the finance man. He flat out lies. I did add on the Nitro Fill but he stated anywhere would top the tires off, when, in actuality, the contract that you receive later states it is only covered to be topped off at their dealership. While Nitro Fill is worth it and I get far better gas mileage, it is not worth it for me to drive 50 miles each way (and he knew this when he sold it to me) to the dealership for a top off as then I lose money. And I also purchased the car care package as the salesman and the finance man both told me that if I got any paint on the car, anywhere, (I am a painting contractor and he saw the paint on the upholstery of my trade in) this covered the removal of paint as well. They also told me my vehicle would be completely detailed once per year. Neither of their claims are true. As far as the Guide Point system, the finance man told me it was already on the car and I had to pay for it so I may as well upgrade $100. This turned out to be absolutely useless as 1. I don't have a smart phone and 2. Several months later it is still not installed on the Jeep. Complete rip off.  I wrote numerous letters about all of these issues but they blew me off. Don't expect to deal with any issues once they have your money.",3.5
480,"September 09, 2011","By far the best car buying experience I've had in 30 years.  They did business on a 21st century level.  I did my homework on the car I wanted and had a price I wanted to pay.  They quoted a price below my mark, I showed up to purchase the car and the price held.  I took over 1 1/2 hours off the car buying experience.  

Even in past years when I leased or bought vehicles and lined up all the details it would take 3-4 hours to complete the transaction.  An added bonus was the pricing on my car was so spot on that I was able to get a higher trim level for my budget.  A tricky area is with the finance manager.  Even in that department I was pleased I was not overly pressured to purchase other add-on goods not wanted and amazing the interest rate they quoted was true.

FYI: I traded in a Ford Fusion for a Chrysler 200.  I intended to get another Fusion but the 200 had more to offer at a savings of $2,000.  My son needs to purchase a car and his choice is a Ford Explorer but after my transaction he will be starting at Orange Coast checking out the Jeeps and Dodge's.

481,"July 18, 2011","I began searching for a car about 3-4 months ago and looked at a great many cars and dealerships over that time. One thing I was determined to review was the quality of the dealership as well as the price of the car in which I was interested.  I worked with a number of dealerships via the internet - which, in my opinion, is the only way to car shop - and used it to rate cars, prices, deals, cost of loans, loan rates and dealerships, to aid in finalizing my decision. Over that period of time, I come to the conclusion that this site (dealerrater.com), Edmonds.com, kellybluebook.com, and others are the best (and only) way to compare and contrast not only the cars you may be intersted in, but just as importantly, the dealerships you work with.  I found that Orange Coast was one of the best dealerships I ever worked with; of course the last time I bought a car was over 10 years ago and the internet wasn't near as sophisticated as it is now.  Still, they and the Sales Manager at OCAuto.com Dave Reed, were very helpful, frendly and patient with my questions on everything from options to final pricing. There was no pressure to buy, no push for ""options"" I didn't want, and no ""monthly payment"" focus to get you into a loan that was full price but ran for 6 or 7 or 8 years.  Fortunately I knew what I wanted and I knew, from my internet research what prices were and what dealers were ""reputable"" and, again, Orange Coast Chrysler, Jeed Dodge rated very highly in all my categories.  I bought a 2011 Dodge Chalenger from OC Auto and Dave Reed made the car buying experience a good one.  I highly recommend OC Chrysler Jeed Dodge and Dave Reed if you;re considering a new Dodge.",4.8

I expected a fight when I got there.  The price was way lower than the other dealers, so I thought they would try to show me something else or deny the price they gave me.  They had a young girl show me the vehicle, and I test drove it - she knew everything about the car and answered all my questions.  She than walked me into a sales manager - He discussed all the rebates and showed me ones that I could qualify for and ones I couldn't.  I spent about an hour doing all of this, then we worked out my monthly payments (it was the same the online calculator had said it would be)  Then they took me into finance.  The lady there was very nice, and she explained all the paperwork, and helped me get a warranty so my car is covered for anything that could happen.  She was very pleasant and had all my paperwork done in minutes.  I told her I was worried about getting financed.  She told me that this dealership has great relationships with most every bank, and she didn't think she would have a problem.  She didn't, she got me financed on Monday and she called me to tell me who the bank was.  I Had a great time considering I was buying a car - All in all - a great sales experience.",5.0

No pressure what so ever.  The curtious, friendly staff was very helpful during the purchasing process.  I would definitely recommend the Orange Coast Pre-Owned Superstore to all of my friends and family. ",5.0
501,"January 26, 2011","I brought in my car for service today and was extremely pleased with PJ. He helped me narrow down the problem I was having with my air conditioning unit then Brian took over and handled the write up and arranged for someone to give me ride home.
I got a call 4 pm that my car was ready. Guys picked me up and drove back to dealership and there was my car washed and all ready for me. He also asked if I had the discount card from the store and I did. I got my discount for being loyal customer.
They asked originally if I want rental and I told them no as did not have much plans for the day. For an old lady to feel that she can rely on those guys was another great experience I have had at orange coast chrysler jeep dodge for years.

Thanks,

503,"January 25, 2011","I took the time to do this because most people will only report the bad. I had been going to another Dodge dealer for service and can not say I was happy with the level of service,pricing or in the manner I was dealt with. I felt as if I was bothering them when I had a question, if you know what I mean.
A friend said he had been going to Orange Coast Dodge for several years and loved the service, so I decided to give them a try. From setting my appointment to getting a report card on my vehicle with descriptions and pricing to being treated like a person and not a number! I can't say enough. The staff, the service, the pricing, down to setting my next appointment. They have my business moving forward.

I will be returning to Orange Coast Dodge in the future. ",3.4

509,"January 20, 2011","Hello...I just wanted to inform you that once again I purchased another new vehicle from Orange Coast Jeep. This is my 4th new vehicle I have purchase from Orange Coast. My lease was close to being up and I received a call from Pete and Paul informing me to come in an take a peek at their new Grand Cherokees and other new vehicles on the lot. I have always leased my vehicles in the past, but due to them taking their time trying to help me figure out what would be best for me either to purchase or lease...They were able to find the best rate out there from the bank and I ended up leaving the dealership with the most beautiful fully loaded 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee Overland and I just love it! Not to mention that I have been a very loyal customer to their service department for many years. I always receive excellent service and leave with a professionally seviced car. I really like the way that their service department keeps me informed when my standard services are due. Again, I really believe that the whole dealership and all of the employees that work there are kind, professional and friendly. I will continue to refer all of my family and friends to Orange Coast Jeep.

510,"January 20, 2011","Needed parts and some service for my 18 year old daughters Jeep Laredo.  She purchased it used from private party.  The parts guys were extreemly wonderful in coming out and looking at the car and taking the time to explain each issue to my daughter and gave her the respect as a vehicle owner.  Most of all it was wonderful that they helped her learn about her car and what had to be done.  What she could do on her own and what she needed their Jeep service department to handle for her. 

When we were in the service bay area, they were prompt and also showed my daughter what they were doing and why.  

Thanks again for giving her a wonderful experience - since Mom won't always be around - she learned what type of service she can expect.  Though after this visit the bar is set pretty high.  

Personally, I have not been to another location or different dealer that went to the personal extremes that they did here.  My husband and I have been to this location before with our other Jeep and Chrysler, and because of the friendly, personal, and prompt service, is why I brought my daughter here too.

thanks again for dealing so well with a young vehicle owner.

I began my purchase experience with a USAA auto-quote request on Labor Day
weekend 2010.  Within 15 minutes of making the request, I received a phone
call from Ryan Lake.  I stopped in to see him later that day, and throughout
my dealings with him, he went the extra mile to ensure that my questions and
concerns were answered, and that I understood the pricing approach that I
could expect.  Ryan was proactive, low-pressure, and always took great pains
to point out advantages to me with regards to the purchase, even going so
far as to provide me an additional discount based on my employment status at
the time of signing.  

I had first started looking at the Grand Cherokee that same Labor Day
Weekend at DCH Chrysler Jeep Dodge in Temecula - where I felt uncomfortably
pressured, to the point of walking out.  My experience at Orange Coast was
exactly opposite; Ryan went out of his way to provide an exemplary level of
customer service.  Once the order was in, he maintained weekly contact with
me to keep me advised of delivery status, and finally, when it came time to
take delivery and sign, Ryan explained every aspect of the process.  The
entire Orange Coast Team, including Neda, Nate, Craig, Bob, and PJ,
represented the Dealership with first-class customer service and competency,
and I look forward to a long continuing relationship with Orange Coast,
specifically due to their attitude and approach to that purchase experience.

Both my wife and I are extremely happy with our new vehicle, which we've had
now a little over a month and a half.  Overall, the experience with Orange
Coast has made this the easiest and most pleasant auto purchase experience
we've ever had.  Please accept both my thanks for the experience and my
congratulations on managing such a fine team of professionals.  ",5.0
512,"January 09, 2011","I was looking to trade-in my older Jeep Grand Cherokee and lease a new 2011 model before the end of the year.  As a nervous car-buyer, I was prepared with my credit report/budget/financial information but was unsure of what vehicle and options would be available for me within my budget.  John Baker worked with me initially and was extremely helpful in determining the value of my previous vehicle, as well as helping to choose the options and color of a new 2011 model that would likely fit my budget.  After determining what to look for with John, the perfect car was available on the OC Jeep lot, so we took a test drive and I was very satisfied.  The new features of the 2011 Jeep are outstanding!  I then met with Paul Whitehead who was very accomodating by meeting me within my time schedule, and in determining the lease terms and agreement.  Paul negotiated a lease with me that perfectly met my needs financially--I could not be more pleased with the car and the lease agreement!!  Both John Baker and Paul Whitehead are very friendly and I would recommend working with them to anyone looking to purchase a vehicle.  While on the lot, I also met with PJ Kleizo in the service department and he advised me of service options with the new vehicle.  I took my previous vehicle to OC Jeep for service and had fair, accurate, and timely service with PJ in particular, so I feel very comfortable going to OC Jeep for service with the new car.  Overall, I am ecstatic about my 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee, the lease that was negotiated, and my great experience at the lot.  What I expected to be a nerve-wracking car buying experience was made into a very easy and smooth transaction.  Thank you OC Jeep!  ",5.0

515,"December 30, 2010","I bought my car at this location -- horrible experience -- my recommendation is to never, ever do business with this dealer.  I received the worst service at this company.  This firm refused to secure my car after it flooded and I was waiting for Jeep to determine if they would cover the defect in the windshield that caused 3 inches of rain to puddle in my car. (This event follows several other instances of  of replacing the same parts repeatedly due to other defects -- which were very costly).  I had to demand that the Customer Service Manager secure the car so that no further damage would occur -- and only after I told him his firm would be legally liable did he take action to secure the car from further damage.  When I asked to speak to the General Manager, the Customer Service Manager refused to transfer the call, stating that the GM was was out of town (I had already confirmed that the GM was onsite that day with the front desk staff). 

When I finally spoke with the GM, he was very condescending when I requested answers as to why I had been given poor service and poor treatment -- he stated that the firm had been in business 30 years and I keep coming back so they must be doing something right.  Are you kidding me???!  I'm not here paying for rental cars (repeatedly) and paying for repairs of obvious defects because I want to -- I expected a higher level of customer service since they sold me the car.  The GM told me to go somewhere else!  Unbelievable!!!  In my opinion this firm should not be in business.  ",1.0
516,"September 16, 2010","Summary: This dealer employs rude, arrogant service managers who blatantly attempt to take advantage of female customers and their perceived naivete.  This is also the most expensive C/D/J dealer I've ever visited, and I've used at least five throughout California.

The first time I visited this dealer, I was shopping for a Jeep.  The saleswoman thought that the best way to sell me on a Jeep was to take me for a test drive and then turn donuts in a local parking lot.  I left, convinced she was insane.  

The second time I visited, several years later, I had had my Jeep towed in because of a dead battery (jumping wouldn't start it).  The dealer sold me a battery for close to $300.  I had no choice but to purchase, as my truck wouldn't start.  The whole time, the service manager was conversing with his cronies and barely looking at me as he shoved paperwork at me to sign.  I was asking questions about my car's behavior and getting vague, ""you're a woman and wouldn't understand"" answers.  

The third time and fourth times I visited (failed LED lamp and transmission flush), the quoted prices were OBSCENELY high compared to either Pep Boys or other dealers.  I also got the same jerk as my service manager.  Although I no longer live in LA, tomorrow I'm driving 50 miles back to Buerge Jeep who will do the transmission flush for $100 less than Orange Coast. Unbelievable and unfortunate that Orange County lacks a respectable or even remotely competitive C/D/J dealer (Tuttle Click isn't any better).",1.0
517,"October 16, 2009","brought vehicle in for alignment.  was told 89 dollars over the phone.  Got to dealership, said it would be 120.  1 hour later Brian Koritzer in service calls to tell me my vehicle cannot be aligned.  Brian said inner/outer tie rods were busted and needed a new wheel and tire, cost would be roughly 1450.  I said not to do any work I would need a second opinion.  

Got to dealership and i still had to pay the price of the alignment that was now listed as an ""inspection fee"" I pointed out the FREE inspection sign and it fell on deaf ears.  Forced to pay the 120 and brought car to Firestone.  Firestone aligned the vehicle and has been operating fine ever since.  I have lifetime maintenance and alignment with Firestone for around 160 bucks, one time fee.  They said there was NO damage to tie rods and wheels were scuffed, not destroyed.
