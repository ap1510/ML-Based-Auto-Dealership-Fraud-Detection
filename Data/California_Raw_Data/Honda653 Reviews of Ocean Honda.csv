8,"December 20, 2019","I had a great experience purchasing a vehicle here. The staff were all informative and pleasant to work with. They made me feel comfortable, confident, and informed. ",5.0
9,"December 20, 2019","The overall experience and time involved was about as good or better than expected. The sales people were friendly, efficient and polite. The negative is the business process of withholding the info. that was eventual part of the deal, i.e. trade-in value of prior lease, credit due from prior lease purchase, the essential add-ons that get identified after you think you know what the final number is; dealer charges, taxes, ship costs, etc. Those all require a silent partner, sales manager (?) to be engaged on each item.  
To me, it takes away the integrity of the business process, i.e. if you don't understand or do not do you homework you are certainly not going to get the best deal. (I guess a fact of life but it doesn't  improve the image or reputation of any dealership). ",4.6

12,"December 18, 2019","The service writer explained the details of what was needed for the 60,000 mile service and added in new wiper blades at the cost of the blades.  He also carefully credited me with the two coupons I had which were a discount based on what the cost was and 5% for making the appointment on line.  I picked up the car when it was expected to be finished and everything seems to be in order.

23,"November 12, 2019","Today's service transition with Justin? I give him a 5 star rating, as usual!

     On the other hand, I waited a year to write this as I have been so angry about the purchase process of my car (purchased in 2018). What brought me in was the promise of the 1.25% value of the car I was trading in. ALEX (SALESPERSON WHO DID HIS JOB WELL) went to talk to Martin (sales manager) about letting me get this value, I got some excuse about how how they only paid for up to 10,000 miles per year on a car, and my car had too many miles. I think mileage was around 65,000.  So, Alex told me Martin would supposedly give me $400 discount on my purchase, which he would include in the contract. A second item I pursued with them was the 2.99% they were offering on TV on the financing if someone had good credit. I did.
I sent Alex to talk to Martin again, and was told ""that deal ended yesterday"". Seriously? If a car company cares about its customers, they work with them, not against them. 
     And, I should not have been surprised that Martin changed the amount he would give me on his car. His slick wording was ""We said we would give you $200, remember?"" like I was forgetting what I had been told by Alex. How underhanded can someone be? And, again, is the policy to just be dishonest to the customer?
     Then, to top it off, I bought the GAP insurance for 950 dollars. When I refinanced the car through another company that did offer me 2.99%, I asked for the GAP insurance back. I was told that I needed to produce a receipt that the new financing had begun to get the insurance returned to me. More than 2 months of calling later, I was told by a woman who dealt with the return paperwork that ""Oh, yeah, it's been here for a couple of days"". Why hadn't I been called? How long would they have kept it without calling me? I will always wonder, because trust was lost.
     Just be careful to bring in a taping device so you can replay them what they promise you. So, at the end of the 4 hour purchasing period when you're tired and ready to go home and signing paperwork, they cannot smoothly change their promises like what happened to me. 
And, DON'T BE FOOLED BY THE PROMISE OF 1.25% TRADE IN VALUE OR 2.99% FINANCING TO PULL YOU IN. Yes, I learned my lesson, and want to advise the buyer to BEWARE.

24,"November 08, 2019","There are questions I have as to the total transaction. I guess I can't get the HOV decal from the dealership and need to go to the DMV. That's less convenient. Then there are 4 rebates for purchasing a plug in vehicle that I'm not sure of until I see checks from IRS, State of California, PG&E, and AMBAG.
One issue for me is whether there is an income test that either eliminates or reduces the size of rebates and no one seemed sure. Maybe there is no issue there. Then my last point is that the charger coil was missing from the car I purchased so I've been driving on gasoline when I shouldn't have had to for 5 days. I don't know yet if I need to get an electrician's help to use the charger cord until I get it. So while I like Crispin and believe he had the desire to be fully helpful, as to the dealership I either have the issues above or this questionnaire is coming a little early before all issues for me were resolved.",4.2

29,"October 26, 2019","One of the best service Depts.  I""ve been to . Dustin has been my Service Adviser for over 17 years.
Wouldn""t take my vehicle any where else.  Dustin is a pleasure to work with with and when he says my vehicle should be ready at a certain time It always is.  I have purchased 26  new Honda's since 1979.  10 of them was from Ocean Honda  Things have changed since the new owner came in a few years ago and I can save 2 or 3 thousand dollars by  using other Honda dealers. I always try Ocean Honda but they can never equal the price I can buy on at another Honda dealer.  John was a general Manager a few years ago and he knocked about $800 off the sticker price on the window. He stated that they were here to make money and not loose it. I went to another dealer and purchased the same vehicle for $ 2,700 less.

150,"May 02, 2019","I had an urgent need to get the trainer wiring fixed on my CR-V before I left town for a long weekend
This had been a problem since the Dealer installed the Hitch and 4-pin trailer wiring. The first time I brought in was about a year after the hitch was  installed. They diagnosed the problem and said they forgot to add the Fuse needed for the trailer lights to work. OK, thanks, no charge.
I thought I was good to go. So now, approximately three years later, same problem. I don’t use the trailer but 2 or 3 times a year. I couldn’t get the running lights on the trailer to work. Bummer, now I have to get this fixed before I leave for the weekend trip hauling my dirt bikes to the Sierras Mountains and Yosemite.
I rewired the trailer with new lights and all new wiring harness; making sure I had a good ground. 9 Hours later, I have brake and turn signal lights, but no running lights. I bought a 4-pin trailer light tester to make sure the car was correct. It wasn’t.
OK, now I need help from the dealer. My car is not right. It's not my work on the trailer. On Tuesday I went on line to make an appointment to get this fixed, again.
What do you know; I can get in at 10:30a today, that’s great. This problem is eating me up inside, I got to go. I took the rest of the day off from work and went to Ocean Honda. The service writer Eric looks up my service records, he sees I have been in for this issue before. “We’ll get right on it.” “I’ll give you an update at 1:30 or 2. I’m thinking that’s a long time, but what the heck, I can’t live this way, so I go to the waiting area and settle in. Good thing I brought the Newspaper with me.
About 1:45 I got anxious so I go to Eric and ask how it is going. He came back a little while later, he’s working on it. I’m about ready for another free sandwich because I might be till 7pm tonight. No problem, I’m committed now. I need to let the mechanic do his job without me interfering. This has got to get fixed or I’ll be a nervous wreck driving home after dark on Sunday night. I remind Eric not to forget about me cooling my heals in the waiting area. That was a problem before.
3:30p Good news, we found the problem. It was a blown 5 amp Fuse in the wiring harness near the spare tire. I never would have found that in time by myself. I am so relieved. I ask Eric to show me where it was in the car, just in case it happens again. I also use my little light tester to be sure. It looks good.
I’m leaving tomorrow for a long weekend and now I have one less thing to worry about.
Thank you Eric, the mechanic, and Ocean Honda. You guys took good care of me. I appreciate that very much.

They were flexible about the work I had done,  just the service I wanted and needed. For example, they didn't charge for tire rotation in my inspection since it had just been done the day before. They were a little conservative on estimating wear on one or two items, but not unreasonably so. They set reasonable  expectations about time and cost, and delivered above that. 
It may be possible to get work (and parts) at lower cost outside of the dealership; Ocean Honda has a good service department that I feel I can trust to do solid work without scamming me, which is partly why I drive an hour to bring it there for major service instead of my local dealer.

During my first service at 5,000 miles I had to purchase a new tire because the NEW TIRE that came with the car, kept going flat. Honda charged me $125.00 for a tire. This was a brand new car, it is ludicrous that I would have to pay for a tire that Ocean Honda claims was leaking by the rim. Upon calling the Manufacturer they said that Ocean Honda should of sent them back the tire so they could determine how much money would be refunded to me. I was treated awful as if no one even cared.  Dreading the fact that I had to come back for my 10,000 mile service, my car was checked in by Guillermo (excellent employee) then I was greeted  by Dustin Mosley. I explained to Dustin how upset I was and why. Not only did Dustin resolve the  previous issue I had, he made me feel valued and did it in the most professional manner possible. I wish all of the Service Advisor's had his knowledge and Integrity when dealing with customers. I can now look forward to coming back to Ocean Honda for my 15,000 mile service.

 I will continue to drive from Gilroy to have my car serviced at this Honda Dealership!  I have had bad experiences with the one close to my home, and because I was visiting my son over in Santa Cruz one day, when my car had trouble, I went to the nearest dealership.  I had the best experience I have had in a long time.   The Honda Dealership that was in Gilroy was very good, but this place even outshined them.

I truly appreciated the salesmen getting to know me and my needs without any pressure to purchase more than I needed. This is the number one reason I continue to return to this dealership. After a short test drive the salesman knew what I was looking for and I absolutely love my new car!! Thank you!

The only negative feedback is that the person who did my paperwork entered the wrong mileage on the contract when it was supposed to be 15000 miles a year. He hand wrote the correct mileage on the contract and said he would retype the contract when I picked up the car two days later. When I returned, the paperwork wasn’t ready and was mailed to me the following week. The contract hadn’t been updated and hand written change isn’t easily visible on the copies. So I will need to follow up on this to ensure the correct mileage was captured on my lease. ",4.8

508,"March 08, 2018","I am never disappointed when coming to this dealership.   I made the appointment to have my car serviced by calling to do so.  When I arrived on Sat, they did not have me down.   The tech told me he could still take me, but that it wouldn't be done until 4pm.   Needless to say I wasn't thrilled about that.  I live in Gilroy and typically wait while my service was being done.  It was 11:30 in the morning and wasn't loving the idea of having to be there all day.   The tech said, let me talk to the shop manager.  Long story short, they got me in and done in 2 hours.  

In addition to that, when my car was done.  Vince D. brought my car out and noticed that there was a plastic cover just laying in the door.  He asked if that was already there or was it something they forgot to put on.  I said, no it was already there, but I forgot to tell them about it and not to worry about it, I would just do it next time I came.   He said, do you mind if I take a quick look?  Sure!  I didn't know where the piece fell off from so he took the car back in the shop and found where it went.

I have previously owned Hondas and my last CRV was the best car I ever had. I changed it up a few years back and bought a top of the line BMW 228i – with all of the additional bells and whistles. Even having this hot car, I knew I wanted to go back to an SUV. My boyfriend and I both researched and tested the top SUV’s on the market. At first, I was pro BMW because of the engine and the power, but fell in love with the re-designed CRV that came out in 2017.
 We did our research and looked for a few months online for specifics I wanted – an EXL or Touring model, 2017 or 2018, under 25,000 miles, with specific exterior and interior colors. We finally found the car online at Ocean Honda – and surprisingly happy that the dealership was only a few miles away.
When we popped into the dealership on a Friday later afternoon, we were greeted by the Business Development Manager Chris and started our inquiries. When he realized we were serious and would be strong negotiators, he called in Alex Guyster, one of their top sr. salesmen. What a fun experience!!
Alex had to work for this sale – but what was great was that he was willing to work with us on the price of the car and of my BMW trade in. He had to work!! Alex was great and he had a lot of fun selling to us! We so appreciated with what he came up with, how he explained everything so clearly and made us feel very good about the entire buying experience. We met the new General Manager Adil Elomri who was also very gracious, as well as Conor Geissler, the Finance manager we worked with.

When we came back for our tutorial on the car a few days after the sale, we all knew this was a perfect new car for me. I want to thank everyone we worked with at Ocean Honda for a positive experience!!

He asked which one I said another CRV but I thought it might be to big.  So he showed me the HRV and I really liked it.

This was the best experience ever I fell in love with the car I got to take the time to really check it out and read about it and I was sold.  He worked it out so that I could get the one I wanted which was limited in California and I couldn't be happier.  Being able to take that car home and really check it out was the deal clincher.

Dustin, the service rep. was attentive and informative. 66,000 mi. service completed in 2.5 hours. Even though I live in Marina, I use Ocean Honda  because of the CarDoc program. In 4.5 years, I have only had  positive experiences at Ocean Honda.",4.8
563,"January 08, 2018","I recently took my car into Ocean Honda (January 2, 2018) for its 10 K service.  I made my appointment for 11:30 am.  This was my third attempt to get my car serviced.  The first time the electricity was out and service personnel were unable to perform. The second time I booked service through the internet and that did not go through. I called to verify and they said my appointment was not in the system.  The third time was over the phone to book my service.

I delivered my car on time.  The service agent did not write my contract until 11:47 am.  I was told over the phone and in person that it would not take more than an hour and fifteen minutes.

I didn't leave Ocean Honda until 2:30 pm.

It took three hours for what was essentially an oil change and inspection.

So the Car Doc package  was essentially a rip off.  I could have gotten better service elsewhere.

This notion that a company can waste the time of a customer like this is absolutely outrageous, as if the customer's time is unimportant.

This has no integrity and doesn't keep its word.

Because of this incident, I will not purchase this car at the end of the lease and I will never buy or lease a Honda again, at least from a dealership.

This is unfortunate because I absolutely love my car but the service was abysmal and I will never give my money again to a company that values its customers so little.

On top of all that, despite being forced to wait for three hours, the water fountain did not work.

Thank you for ruining the start of my new year.

This company has left a bitter taste in my mouth and I will communicate this disappointment far and wide.

580,"December 16, 2017","Did what I asked, found problems, kept me informed. Genuine parts and factory service/tools. Tried generic shop, messed up my brakes with cheap parts. Back to dealer, no problems. 

Been using this place since 2008. Never had something they fixed come out wrong or break again.

Did notice price hike and slight service pricing flexibility decline after some investment group brought it up. That is too bad. It used to be best price and best service. 

I can't quite put my finger on it, but I feel the service changed after the buy out. In the past, I felt like they would repair things and bill a fair standard hourly rate, now everything is feels like ""replace the unit rather than fix the defect"" and ""charge the flat rate per menu item.""

Price has become an issue lately, but good work costs more, and with coupons they can be reasonable. 

Minor issue is that the dealership is super popular, so appointment is an absolute must. Even with appointment there can sometimes be a 10 min wait because the lines are so long. Be patient, your service representative might be with another person, while someone else's is not. This means someone in line behind you might get served before you. If this happens, don't act like a baby. As soon as they finish, the representative will move to the next in line very promptly. 

Appointments are spread out at 15 minute increments, but things can get thrown off by customers that come late or try to squeeze in early, or show up with no appointment at all. Oh well, I have never had to wait more than 15 minutes and the shuttle is great!",4.2

We got the car and deal we wanted. They even threw in the Honda Sensing package for us.  In the end everyone went home happy that night. 
well see you in 2-3 years Ken. Keep it up. ",4.8

Also thank you to all the personal their that made my experience the best . What a great experience. ??",5.0

650,"July 16, 2013","Shopping for a new Odyssey, went to a dealership in the bay area got a deal I liked,  so I called Ocean Honda (my local dealer) and asked them if they would match the deal I would come there to buy the Odyssey.  The only reason I called Ocean Honda, is that I live in Santa Cruz, and would have liked to keep my money local.  Once I got to Ocean Honda, I was given a completely different price.  I was shocked!  Not only did they not honor the price match, I was then told I was a BullShi**er!!!  I'm read to spend 40k and the General Manager (John Monteleone) of the store is yelling at me and calling me a BSer.  
I HAD THE OFFER IN WRITING!

I would and could not recommend this Dealership to anyone with a little self respect.",1.0
651,"May 28, 2012","This was the most blatant bait and switch dealership I ever experienced. Was looking for a specific vehicle. Called Ocean Honda dealership spoke with Internet sales – Chris O'Connell - and was told that they have SUV in stock. Asked several times, giving specifics of the car, and stating that I need to pick-it up today. Was told – yes, vehicle is in stock. 
I live in San Jose, 30 miles away. Called again, to confirm that I am leaving, and that car is in stock, and that I am ready to pick it up today. Was told – yes, it is. 
Packed my family ( 2 kids ), drove for 30 miles, experienced kids getting bored and fighting, traffic and curves of HW 17.
Upon arriving at the dealership, was greeted by another sales guy, Chris never came out. After 30 minutes of no action, learned that there is no car in stock, and that they are “securing” it from another dealership.
I have Called Chris, to express my disappointment. During the call I mentioned that this dishonest behavior is unacceptable, and will be reported to BBB and yelp. Instead of apology, Chris started pretending to be scared, and I quote “oh, no, not Yelp”. 
I have spent 2 hours of my time, 60 miles and 3 gallons -  think twice before patronizing this place.

652,"November 09, 2011","I can't wait to share my experience with others. Never go here as it seems that if you don't have a solid credit rating these people, managers Chris and Alejandro {Alex} who are so unprofessional in my opinion will try their best to get as much money out of you as possible for their own pockets.  I don't believe all salespersons have the same low integrity.  I am employed as middle school teacher about an hour away from Santa Cruz, the city in which I live and where these 2 predators do well at contributing to the bad rep. car dealerships get.  I plan to search places that review car dealerships to warn others to stay away.",1.4
