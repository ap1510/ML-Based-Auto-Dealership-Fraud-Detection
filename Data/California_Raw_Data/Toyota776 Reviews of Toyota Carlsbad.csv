0,"January 20, 2020","Not a very organized place to say the least in regards to the sales team...but I don't even have the energy to go into that.  I ended up buying from Austin Nguyen at Mossy Toyota instead.  Let's just say Austin N at Mossy Toyota is a stand up guy who sticks to his word.  Toyota Carlsbad is the biggest dealer in the area....they act like it too.  I went there first and they could have had my business by simply sticking to the deal they offered via their ""Toyota Express.""  Instead they gave me a bunch of stereotypical car salesman lines about ""computer didn't calculate this..."", ""we don't lease that because..."", ""wait, we will lease that but not at the price we offered, it's gonna cost more because..."", ""let me get my managers..."".  By the time they came around to offering me the same price as Austin at Mossy (on a different truck) they had lost my respect and I wouldn't have bought from them if they had beat Austin's price.  Trust me, go with Mossy and Austin Nguyen.  The negotiation feels more like a discussion about your new vehicle price, Realizing my mistake and calling Mossy, saved me $100/month off of the ""Toyota Express"" price from Carlsbad.",1.4
1,"September 06, 2019","Martin Suarez was truly exceptional! Assisted me with selecting a great car, a 2020 Corolla Hybrid. Terrific dealership! Also, I want to thank the finance manager Mandi Grudek. I would definitely recommend buying or leasing from Toyota of Carlsbad. ",5.0
2,"August 30, 2019","Always a pleasure working with Jeff, Steve and Mandi! The team here always makes it easy, start to finish. I appreciate the fact that they will go above and beyond to get the right car and deal. This is my 3rd purchase from this store since 2014, and won’t go anywhere else. Can’t thank you enough and can’t wait to send more people your way:",5.0

  If I had the option to give less than 0 stars I would. I visited this dealership on December 12th to fix an oil leak. They diagnosed it as the common Timing seal leak. Had to go on my lunch break and bring my car to the dealership. Had to take 4 Ubers to pick my 1yr old up from daycare, get home, get back to work and then to the dealership the next day. Told me my car was ready and still had to wait an hour being late to pick my kid up from daycare and payed for additional time at the daycare.
 I had to bring my car back for another oil leak 30 days later on Jan 11th
Guess what...The Timing cover was leaking again due to faulty workmanship and/or crappy sealant. They had my car for another day which caused me to have to take 4 more Uber rides. I was not offered a rental for either visit and when i asked about it they said I would be charged even though I was getting warranty work done. They instructed me that they fixed the Timing Leak but they now found a leak coming from the driver side Cam cap and it looks like someone previously resealed it using a black sealant and not Toyota's grey sealant so now its not covered under warranty and I would have to pay 3551.00 dollars to fix it. 
 As you can expect I was furious and extremely disappointed. A month later I brought it back for what looked to be another Timing Seal Leak but after checking it out they said its the Cam cap leak and it has gotten worse and it'll be 3551.00 dollars to repair and it will not be covered over some sealant. The defective first gen throw out bearing also gave out and my car stopped on the highway yesterday 3/14/2019 and is inoperable so there's that problem now but that's another story. 
  I created a case with Toyota and a case manager reached out to me to say it wont be covered under warranty because the sealant is different. The Case manager Hivi also told me the dealership said it looks like someone else worked on the exhaust before as well because a few exhaust bolts were different and any parts that aren't Toyota ie. the 1-2 bolts voids the warranty on those parts; FOR EXHAUST BOLTS!  They cannot help me because a different sealant was used even though their Toyota sealant still leaks so the sealant isn't gods gift to sealant. Basically I'm being denied coverage on a part that would be covered but because of some insignificant detail it wont be. It's just a sealant not an aftermarket part that caused an issue, not because the car is modified, not because of a part was installed incorrectly but because a different sealant was used that leaked overtime like the Toyota sealant did on me twice in 30 days causing me to spend more money trying to get around California with a 1 yr old and no vehicle. Now I'm stuck without a running vehicle with no help from the dealership other than 5000 dollars in repairs for sealant, a KNOWN crappy throw out bearing and no help from Toyota and being told I'm SOL. The fact that they treat warranty so Black & White is extremely disappointing. There is no Grey area so don't ever change any bolts, screws, washers etc on your car because it will void your warranty on those parts apparently because they're not Toyota parts. If you find your radiator leaking DO NOT put a clamp on it to get it to the dealer before your engine overheats and causes damage because it will void your warranty just let it blow your motor so its covered.
Regretting the day I bought this car and should have stuck with Nissan. Everybody from my company brings their car here but that will change. They didn't even offer ANY type of assistance, not 50.00 dollars off, not a car wash and barely any empathy.",1.4
4,"October 19, 2018","I had a great car buying experience. I did not have to deal with pushy car salesmen but instead was pleasantly surprised with how the sales people were easy to talk to and work with. When I went to test drive, Jesse went out of his way to make sure he drove me in a cart since I am pregnant/3rd trimester and had a hard time walking. When I negotiated the price of my car Frank was very forthright and offered me the best deal he could. I did not have to take long to make my decision to buy from Toyota Carlsbad and would definitely consider making a purchase there in the future years to come. I did not feel overly pressured like I have had at other dealerships. My friend told me she bought two cars from them in the past decade and highly recommended the company. I can now see why...",5.0

Rich Wood and his team diagnosed my car appropriately, listened to my concerns and recommendations, provided outstanding communication throughout four consecutive days while working diligently to resolve an uncommon car issue, all the while, keeping me up to date on the process. In addition, he provided me with alternative means to get to work, kindness, respect and overall outstanding Superior Service. I cannot thank you all enough at Toyota Carlsbad service department!

He was responsive without being pushy and soon we were talking over the phone to refine our wish list. When we finally decided to purchase the car, we went to the dealership to meet with him. Once again he was incredibly responsive to our needs and treated us like long time customers. He made buying our new car easy and pain free.

12,"September 15, 2018","After being avoided by a few different sales people someone finally unwillingly helped us. 
After allowing one test drive we asked to test a second vehicle for comparison  

“Are  you going to be making an offer on one of these vehicles today?” Asked our salesman. 
 He wouldn’t get the keys until I answered. 
I said yes,  and asked if people usually come here and drive cars without wanting to buy one. His answer “all the time, guys bring girls here on dates and pretend they are going to buy them a car.”   As the visit continued it became very clear that no one in the dealership thought we could afford the car we wanted.

18,"August 27, 2018","I was lucky to meet an amazingly gifted salesperson who listened to my needs. Franklin knows how to ask pertinent questions and immediately set someone at ease. Once we established what I was looking for, he suggested a few different cars that were available. I only drove two, as we both felt the Lexus hybrid would meet all my needs and get excellent gas mileage at the same time. What a bonus! The whole process was virtually painless, the finance department was efficient, and working with Franklin was like working with a friend. He is extremely personable, has a wonderful sense of humor, and genuinely cares about people. I wasted no time referring my friend to him, and she bought a car the same day they established contact. She too, is thrilled with her car and the level of service she received from Franklin. Efficient, quick, easy and fun!",5.0

25,"July 14, 2018","Stopped in to get a new car and had the pleasure of meeting up with Moe. One of the salesmen there in the lot!  

We were pretty specific as to what we wanted and how much we wanted to spend!  Moe made it happen and in a few hours we drove off the lot in our new car!

He was professional, kind and truly understanding of our needs and situation and never once did we feel he cast any judgement on us!

I can honestly say that I will definetly go back and would feel extremely confident and comfortable recommending Moe as the sales rep!

Thank you Moe!  It was truly a pleasure doing business with you!

First dealer I ever gone into that their salesmen are NOT jumping at you like Hungry Wolves !!!!!!
Most professsional folks work here .... from sales to finance 

I have been looking for a corolla for past 3 months and I live in Orange County and I checked prices with every single dealer in Southern California because I am really cheap !! 
No one and I mean no other dealer in SoCal could match toyota of Carlsbad’s prices so I drove all the way here to buy it from them today

He was very kind and professional and was able to solve some problems so that we could get the deal done. We weren’t even planning on buying a car just to test drive the 2018 Highlander. But he was excellent and I could tell that he really knew and understood the business. He gave us a great deal.

44,"March 06, 2018","I purchased a preowned car end of Dec 2017 from TOYOTA  CARLSBAD with a trust that is toyota dealership and has warranty and according to them,They  checked the car before selling! 
I purchased in the night time !
1-ENGINE LIGHT came on after 2 hours that I purchased the car and it was  about 10Pm and every where closed!Can you emagine how I felt!Next morning early I called the sale person and I told him about the car and his answer was you already drove the car and you signed! I was so upset and sooo cheated ! So I drove to dealership and I asked to talk to the owner of dealership and yet got no where except got talk down at and they wouldn't let me to write her an email! I assumed she must care that how people get cheated and they get treated in her dealership!
Over 30 times between going  in person and calls ,Yet no result!
2- Time of the purchase,I saw  SEAT HANDLE on the floor and asked why seat handle is there and the answer was not big deal ,easy to  put it toghther and I find out after the purchase $900  later yes,it can be put toghter by dealership!
3-Few days later had to call towe truck ,Car wouldn't start ! 4 hours into it and so worried !
I find out that they left 5 YEAR OLD BATTERY! Had to buy a new battery right from towe truck $200 later! Running so late to work and worried what is next???
4-Come to change the oil ( Since was 3 oil change was given in purchase contract in their own dealership) They told me ,That is
NO SPARE TIRE! AND NO TOOLS in case of flat tire!NEVER WAS DISCLOSED IN THE TIME OF PURCHASE!ANOTHER CHOCK!
$800 Spare, $200 Tools they don't care what happens to the customers ,As long as get rid of the car !WHAT A RISK CONSUMER HAS TO TAKE!
I decide to write  in internet,So other consumer know and suddenly after failing to get any respond
immdiately hear from dealership and they write and disclose my name in internet! How do you like that ,Their consumer gives their private info to them and they expose you ! You are private  and they are public!So upset!
in one point ,We start talking  and consumer connection suggest that I take my car to them and They take it where they can save money to get estimate!!!Instead of what is right to do ! Still let's see where they can save more buck!!!
Their goal is not to do right by you as consumer always is $$$$$ NO CONSCIOUS!
They called me several times to come and to get paid for battery and take care of things their way! 
They have no value for consumer 's safety or time that is one 's salary!
I told them ,I take it to dealership that I trust and get an estimate and bring it over .
 I find out ,When I was in  that dealership for estimate that I could buy my model car $3000 less than I paid for with none of these problems!
I PAID 30% MORE!
I called yesterday to book for my 2 oil change and they told me ,I can't get one ,Since I used all 3 of them!!! IS LIKE A JOKE! I left a message for will yesterday and no respond ,is now next day 7:30 PM after I went in person this morning to find out they are repeating the same nonesense by all different people! So I left message for Venessa and will ,I asked to speak to them ,they said they are in meeting ! 7 hours gone by still no respond!
I only did 1 oil change !RIGHT HAND DOESN'T KNOW FROM LEFT HAND! and mistakes always in favor of delearship!
again from yestetrday 4 calls ,went in person and 2 messages from yesterday and telling me I have no oil change left! IS LIKE TWILIGHT ZONE!
They want to cheat me  on even 2 oil change even though is in writting!another $150!!!
and I just purchaded the car !!!
Again waisting 3 hours of my work and they don't respond to2 voice mail after 24 hours for oil change !
THEY HAVE DONE NOTHING !!!but to worry,upset ,insult and have me at risk and cheated me of money and my time !!!
Their owners claims ,She is with God and goes lecture about what a great person she is ,That even upsets me more !
This is not sign of greatness or person with  GOD!
You make your money by putting people ON PURPOPSE AT RISK! You do wrong by people they come to trust your business!
 You cheeted me and I came to trust you!!!
you are cheeting even today from giving $150 next 2 oil change that was signed on the contract ,by denying it!Who knows how many more times that has to be followed!
I left a message and is 7:30PM and never called me back!I thought to save time in oil change time ,They take care of all the bills ,Yet They are hiding!
They are CROOK !
Please have mercy on yourself and do not buy car from them! You are safer buying a car from street side,At least your guard is up and you do the checking!
Wait ,they are going to respond right away to the comment on internet !by more LIES!to make them look good!
If you in person they don't care!
I still don't want to believe the owner is this cruel and crook and without any concscious!
we are at risk as a consumer since all NEGATIVES DO NOT GET  DISCLOSED and they do minimum work on used cars so more profit,they didn't even bother to change battery that is so cheep and they didn't disclose no tool for flat tire !!! They put people AT RISK!
SHAME ON YOU!HOW DO YOU LIVE WITH YOURSELF!
THE REASON THEY DON'T DISCLOSE ,BECAUSE CONSUMER WOULD NOT PAY THE SAME PRICE!
ALL COMES TO MONEY! YUCK!!!

46,"February 27, 2018","I went in for an oil change on my 2004 Toyota solara. Knowing she was “older”, I’d have to think about a new car. I really liked the C-HR when it debuted last year. I hadn’t driven one nor seen one in person. But after Saturday, that all changed! My service advisor, Chien, should be rewarded for taking the time to tell me the things that needed to be looked at on my solara and telling me he would type “slow” so I could test drive the C-HR. He even came back and checked on me as the process was moving forward with the new car. If he wouldn’t of been so nice and understanding, this whole thing probably wouldn’t of happened! Thank you Chien 😁. 

After a little round about getting me the car I wanted, I was finally on my way. Between John starting with me and then frank taking over, we were rolling. 

Once I got to finance, Tim couldn’t of been any better if he wanted too. After what had been a very long day, Tim was a breath of fresh air!

52,"January 15, 2018",What a complete waste of time. We had an awful experience with Lou Maldonado at Toyota of Carlsbad. We are returning Toyota owners. He was completely incompetent. He dragged us along for the whole month of December. We went in several times only to find him and 4 other sales people sitting around a desk on there cell phones.  Lou simple did not care and was so unorganized he has no idea what he was doing or what was going on. He would promise us a call back and he would never follow up. We had to chase him around.  His number and quotes changed and we missed out on Toyota thon and several other deals that were presented to us from the telephone sales department. The manager did not take time to call us back after we complained about Lou. I am so disappointed in the lack of professionalism going on at this place.

54,"December 30, 2017","Duff Joy,

I just wanted to send you this short note to express my appreciation for the excellent service that you, David and Bob provided to me yesterday when I returned my 2015 Camry Lease and got my new 2018 Camry Lease.  The entire process went very smoothly and I did not feel stressed out, which is especially appreciated given that I was a little bit under the weather yesterday.  All of you were very professional in how you treated me.  I continue to have good impressions about Carlsbad Toyota and its staff (most of you I learned have been with the dealership for many years) and that is why at every given opportunity, I do not hesitate one bit to recommend Carlsbad Toyota to my family and friends.

72,"September 10, 2017","Who knows your car better than Toyota?  Not Toyota of Carlsbad!  I want to let everyone in the surrounding area know to BEWARE of Toyota of Carlsbad.  The frontline staff there is great, but It seems upper management is the problem.  Instead of trying to resolve the customer’s issue(s), the first thing they do is see if you always had maintenance done at their center.  I believe management has a very arrogant and cocky attitude due to the high volume of automobiles that come in for service.  That is why management just considers people as numbers instead of loyal customers.  

I am writing this in regards to the bad experiences I had at the Toyota of Carlsbad dealership.  I would be doing myself, Toyota of Carlsbad and other customers a disservice if I do not make a complaint.  Being a loyal customer of Toyota of Carlsbad for many years, I feel that they screwed me over.  Management wants you to be loyal to them, but they are not loyal to their customers.  I have tried to rectify both situations I had with Toyota of Carlsbad’s management, but I got nowhere. 

On 07/02/16, I took my 2009 Toyota Camry XLE in for a 65K mile service and 17 point visual inspection.  They only recommended that the brake and transmission fluid be flushed.  They also were going to charge me $75.00 just to replace my positive battery terminal and clean it.

On 02/11/2017, I took my vehicle in for an oil change.  The service representative recommended that I get the 70k mile service.  She explained to me all the things that were going to be done.  After the service was done is when I started experiencing issues with my vehicle.  My car was pulling more to the right instead of driving straight.  The car was shaking when I would brake and the steering wheel was making weird clicking noises.  I decided to look under the hood to see what the issue was and discovered that my power steering and brake fluids were way below the minimum level.  My windshield wiper fluid was almost empty.  My oil fluid was even low.  I have been paying for these maintenance services, and little to nothing was being done.  The multipoint inspection only noted corrosion on my battery.  

If Toyota of Carlsbad was doing inspection checks like they were supposed to, they would have made me aware of these issues I am currently having.  Toyota of Carlsbad knows not keeping proper routine preventive maintenance on a vehicle causes major problems.  Being a loyal customer, I have always had my vehicles serviced at Toyota of Carlsbad.  I called other dealerships in the surrounding area just to be sure of protocol.  They all refilled the fluids during the mile service checks.  I paid for the services to be done, but I had to do them myself.  Why on earth would Toyota of Carlsbad leave my vehicle unsafe like that?

I contacted the Toyota of Carlsbad dealership a couple of times and did not get a response back. I attempted to resolve my complaint directly with the parties involved, but nothing got fixed.  I went through this before with them over my 4Runner, so I went on their website and filed a complaint.  I then got a message from one of the customer relations manager.  At first the conversation seemed sincere, but then things got sour real fast.  Instead of taking responsibility for the dealership’s negligence, the customer relations manager tried to shift the blame on me.  These problems occurred because the Toyota of Carlsbad dealership failed to do their job properly.  I thought she was very rude, unprofessional and insensitive.  She was not listening, letting me speak and was talking down to me.  At the end of our conversation, she told me “good luck” with an arrogant tone.  After that, I received an email from the general manager of Toyota of Carlsbad.  I told him about my experience with his dealership.  He never replied back. 

I contacted Toyota Corporate and they told me to try and resolve the issues with the dealership.  I told them I did, but did not get anywhere.  One of the Toyota Corporate representatives tried to mediate with Toyota of Carlsbad’s management team.  He was very helpful in trying to rectify the problem and put me in contact with a couple of people in management of Toyota of Carlsbad.  I spoke to a couple of friendly service representatives and the service manager.  Nothing got resolved and I feel that the service manager could have offered me a better deal based on all the issues I had with their dealership.  

On 07/18/2017 I took my car back in to get inspected properly.  They told me it will cost over $8,500 to get my car fixed.  I was in disbelief and feel RIPPED OFF that a 2009 Camry with 70,000 miles could have all these problems. The 2009 Toyota Camry is said to be the worst model made that has many mechanical issues and Toyota knows this. 

A couple of years ago, the issue with my 2002 Toyota 4runner was worse.  The service department did not do the maintenance correctly and my rod went through my engine block.  They had to rebuild my engine and did not even want to cover the cost knowing it was their mistake.  Toyota of Carlsbad did not give me my money back or offered me any deals.  I had to pay for the towing of my vehicle a couple of times because there were issues even though they did repairs on my truck. I even had to pay for most of the cost of the repairs because the general manager at the time thought I should.  The frontline staff all knew it was wrong and thought I was an outstanding customer for not getting upset about the situation.  I was in the military at the time and just kept it professional.  

My door locks is another issue that is unjust.  Not too long after I purchased the car, the door locks started acting up by not locking and opening.  I have contacted Toyota numerous of times about it, but they claim there is no recall on the defective door locks although they are aware of the problem.  There is no coincidence that all the door locks can just go bad almost at the same time just as the premature power steering issues.  I have also searched on the Internet and found out that there are a lot of other people experiencing the same problems I am. Toyota is supposedly known to consistently make the highest-quality cars with the fewest defects of any competing manufacturer, while using less man-hours, fewer on-hand inventory, and half the floor space of its competitors.  Is this really true?   I use to believe this, but now I do not.     
  
Even though I am currently disappointed in Toyota and dissatisfied with their service, I would like for my issue to get resolved. The quality of repairs and service were poor.  There is always supposed to be service after the sale in order to keep customers satisfied.  The first time I did not make a complaint.  I regret it!  After these two events, I do not trust the Toyota of Carlsbad dealership anymore.  This has been one horrible customer experience!  Toyota should strive to provide “World Class Customer Service” and exceed the expectations of their customers.  This is no way to treat military members, veterans or any customers around here in the community!  This is why I want to warn other Toyota of Carlsbad customers to BEWARE!  People need to make sure that the service they are paying for is actually done.  If that means inspecting the car after every maintenance service, then so be it. 

To resolve the problem, I am asked that Toyota of Carlsbad offer a simple apology and cover the cost of the required repairs if any needed (see below).  I did not ask them to pay for everything.  I just ask them to meet me half way based on what they did to my 4Runner, the poor service on my Camry and disrespect I received from their dealership. I think this is fair and reasonable since Toyota of Carlsbad has overlooked basic duties.  I look forward to your reply and settling this matter amicably.  Thank you for taking the time to read this letter.

This wasn't the impression I was given when I purchased this.  Molly in the service department is clearly trained to let me pay $800 for new tires, but find a way out of the warranty.  Took her less than 10 minutes to do that I'd say.  Ivan Mendelson the General Manager and I exchanged messages today.  I just want my money back for the fake tire warranty.  I doubt he'll do anything for me at all.  My customer satisfaction level at this point is ZERO.  I still love my Prius but this dealership may not warrant your business.  Think twice.

89,"July 15, 2017","Unbelievably poor experience with Toyota Carlsbad.

 The lot attendant crashed my truck into a pole breaking my driver side mirror, denting and scratching the door panel as well. I could hear the guy at the kiosk talking to the attendant over the walkie-talkie saying to just ""bend the mirror back"" but it was beyond a band-aid fix. They pulled my truck down to the Service Writer's office and as I walked over, the lot attendant jumped out of the truck without an apology or eye contact. Service Writer did not apologize either, but he promised to ""make it right."" I understand accidents happen and my truck is a bit older, but an apology would have certainly been appreciated. I waited a week to see my truck again, took time off work and came out to look at the work they performed.

Full disclosure, my Tacoma is 17 years old and the paint is a bit faded, but that's no excuse to not even ATTEMPT to match or blend the paint at all. My driver side mirror now vibrates constantly and the reflection makes it very distracting to drive. Never had that problem, and even the passenger mirror is perfectly still even in gale-force winds. So now, I have a bright red driver door (no paint matching attempt at all), a broken mirror that was half-assed in the replacement and on top of it all, there's small chunks of oil or something on the interior upholstery that spread and stain when I tried to clean them. I spent all weekend re-cleaning my truck and the Service MANAGER, Dave Marchienne (apologize if I spelled your name wrong, Dave) has essentially told me to deal with it. I took it back to have the General Manager, Ivan Mendelson, look over the truck and the completely sub-par effort put forth by his service staff. He agreed the work was poorly done and we would hold on to the truck, and call me on Monday to review a few different options to make me whole. I received a call from Dave Marchienne late Monday to say they had detailed, clay-barred, polished my entire truck. Here's the problem, that doesn't restore the paint back to original condition, and it certainly did not help blend the poor paintwork performed. Now, nearly a month later, my truck looks no better than it did before the detailing they did. I'm pissed because my truck's panels used to match, and now they don't. My mirror never had problems, now it bounces and shakes, making the reflection incredibly distracting. They refuse to fix those problems they created. They didn't even offer to knock a few bucks off my service bill. What a joke. This place sucks, the service is awful and they are poor communicators.

I requested a quote to repaint my entire truck so the panels all matched, Dave never got back to me. Ivan never got back to me.  This place is a joke and I will be taking my truck to TOYOTA EL CAJON from now on, I'm sure I will be treated much better there. 

I take a great deal of pride in have a well-serviced, clean, and all original vehicle. I thought taking it to a Toyota Certified Service Center would be the best way to go, but this whole experience has left an awful taste in my mouth. 

Also, many of the recommended services are just a cash-grab effort. I was told my battery ""failed the test."" That's funny, never had any trouble with it, but I know there's more than meets the eye with vehicle charging systems and electronics so I took my truck over to AutoZone and had the perform a free battery and alternator test. Guess what? Nothing wrong with my battery or alternator! Whew! Glad I saved that $200. That's $200 of my hard-earned money that TC will never get.

136,"April 23, 2017","I have been trying to purchase a new Prius Prime with this dealership since January 25th.  I was PROMISED they are associated with the Costco program and PROMISED I would get the Costco price.  I put my deposit down and I was told there was an 8 week waiting period, which is understandable. The first 8 weeks period when my car came in, they called me to notify me.  My deposit transaction sheet stated that I had 72 hours to respond, which I had, but they had already given the car to the next person in line.  I was out of the Country for work, but still replied within 72 hours.  So the next 8-week waiting period, I CALLED THEM to check on the status and their reply, ""was arrival by April 20th."" So they called me on April 20th and told me it had arrived.  I went in and test drove it on April 20th and was willing to purchase it RIGHT THEN.  However, they informed me they were not willing to give me the Costco price b/c the car is in high demand, even though they PROMISED me the Costco price.  This price was $1,000 cheaper, which  in the big picture of purchasing a car, isn't a big deal, but it's the PRINCIPLE.  I was VERY frustrated with their broken promise, but I told them I would make my decision the following morning by 10AM, which my Sales person agreed.  I called them at 10AM and they told me they had ALREADY removed my name from the list and gave to the next person!!  OMG!!  SOOO UNPROFESSIONAL!!
NOT only did they back out of a PROMISE of offering Costco pricing, they gave my car away in FAR less time than they stated at 72 hours!!!  I talked with the Main salesman, Scott and 2nd main salesman, Brian....BOTH of these men had the attitude of ""who cares b/c there are several people waiting for this car."" Their attitude was SO UNprofessional that they are willing to lose a customer over THEIR broken PROMISE of only $1,000.   I have TWO teenagers in the Market for new cars and will DEFINITELY NOT be going to Toyota of Carlsbad.
I notice my $500 deposit hasn't been returned and it is WAY past time of 72 HOURS!!

145,"March 28, 2017","Long story short... I purchased a certified used Camry from Toyota of Carlsbad that had a nail in the tire. I waited for an hour and a half for someone at the service shop to contact someone at the dealership (across the freeway). Richard Wood kept telling me that they left messages and they were waiting for a call back. After an hour and a half of waiting I had FINALLY had enough. I used my cell phone to get the salesman, Alex N. on the phone... he then put me in touch with Dana (the manager). Why was this so difficult? I completed the task in 5 minutes. I would probably still be waiting there if I didn't do the job for them. Richard thanked me for expediting the situation. FINALLY approval was given to replace the tire. Apparently Customer Service is not a priority at this location. Not to mention that the manager at the Service Center told Richard Wood to tell me that I waited too long to report the issue (should have been done before 30 days - I came in at 45 days)... WHATEVER !!! I will say that Richard Wood (Rich) was the only helpful person I encountered. While waiting for my car I saw what I thought was my car drive past and get parking in an adjacent lot (turns out it WAS my car). I asked the concierge if that was my car and he said NO. Really?? How does he know? Well..... Foolishly I accepted his answer. After 45 minutes I again started to really lose patience. I asked the concierge about my car.... in a very unfriendly manner he said.... ""go check with the cashier"" The cashier called and said my car was finished and that they would bring in over. I watched as they drove the car from the adjacent lot.... At this time I was MAD!!! You mean to tell me that I have been waiting almost an hour for car that was ready the whole time. What type of system do you have in place??? The person who I assume should be standing at the Check-in podium was NEVER there. You apparently don't use a paging system??? I guess at this location you just have to keep asking and hope that you are given correct information. You people really need to visit other service locations. You really dropped the ball on this one. I was happy to run over the little red cones when I left. Won't be back and definitely won't recommend Toyota of Carlsbad to ANYONE!!!",1.0

I had checked out the local Toyota and Lexus dealerships around Sacramento, however, I got in contact with an old friend, who recommended Toyota Carlsbad and contacting Ivan Mendleson. It was the best advice.

At the time, I was leaning toward a Lexus CT200h or NX200t but decided to check out the new Toyota Camry. After a ""short"" eight hour drive down South, I finally arrived in Carlsbad. I was greeted at the front door and met Al Vargas and Ivan Mendleson. Ivan handled all the numbers and Al was the best sales person, who was very patience and easy to talk too. I test drove the Camry and fell in love with it very quickly. The smoothness, handling, spacious leg room and overall exterior look sold it itself. It made my decision simple.

409,"August 14, 2016","I have purchased 4 vehicles from Carlsbad Toyota, David Flagg was the easiest salesman to work with, I can't say enough good things about him. My only complaint is having to do with service after the sale. This has happened in the past as well after buying our NEW 2009 Camry Hybrid. After the sale I had a back problem that since has been fixed, however at that time I wanted to upgrade the driver side seat.... Couldn't be done.  I tried others in other Toyota's, and Lexus but nothing could be done. After buying the USED 2011 Sienna Van 2 days ago, I want to add a Toyota factory center console, and have you install it. It can't be done either as I'm told. This is a console you make and offer in your same current Toyota Sienna Vans, Though your service as to oil changes and normal service is outstanding, it's this other lack service that will probably keep me from coming back as a potential customer again. This all has to do with your company's policies, and nothing to do with your employees, as they do as they're told by your policies. ",4.4

They diagnosed and troubleshot the problem to be failed motor and had a replacement available, and so I decided to wait it out there. All the employees there were cordial, and the waiting lounge are was clean and comfortable with free WiFi. The cafe person even brought around complimentary baked cookies! (I had two.)

As it turned out my car was a couple of miles out of warranty, but my service advisor, Corinna Hyatt had arranged it so that the repair would still be warranted which was a very pleasant and generous surprise. 

My overall experience at Toyota Carlsbad was fantastic and much thanks to all the staff there who made it so.

A year or so ago after one of the services on my vehicle the light telling me that I needed servicing turned on after I left the center.  I returned and the service attendant called the service manager who explained that they had neglected to reset the notice.  I just took my new car for service and encountered the same problem.  My big concern is that if the resetting of the alarm is overlooked, how many other steps in the process of the service were also overlooked?  I am not confident that my vehicles are getting the proper service.  Having it happen once can be excused, but having it happen again is unforgivable and does not make your company look good.. ",3.6

The two service managers (Kevin Skinner and Kevin Laird) have always given great advice as to the maintenance needs for my vehicles.  

I have been going to Toyota Carlsbad since I purchased my first vehicle there in 2001.
Since then I have never broken down or had to worry about the performance of my vehicles.  I attribute this to the auto technician and the service managers.  

The personnel at this dealership service center have been well chosen and have always been professional and courteous towards me.  For example, on 21 July 2001, I had to have a tire replaced due to a nail puncture in the sidewall.  One young man, Mike Covington, saw me in the waiting area and took his time to say hello.  He remembered me from when the old service center was a part of the sales center before the new service center was built.  This may seem a small thing, but it goes to show the attitude these employees present when dealing with customers.

First I went to their used car section, the guy greeted us with great enthusiasm, started showing corolla, he showed us 16K driven car and told the price 17K, as one of my friend bought the same car new for 16340 $ + 2K (dmv reg etc), I questioned him why are you selling a used car for 17K, he immediately showed his real nature, the first thing he said was ""I have never heard anything more ridiculous in my life"", next ""why have you come here go to where your friend bought the car from"", next was ""Go to KIA"". he was very arrogant and rude and while he was saying all this to us, we realized that we are standing near to the road and people are seeing us and smiling.

Second, after 2 days I went to their new car section with my friend who bought a new car (19340 $ on road) few days back they said they selling the car on 0% interest, 345 $ per month X 60 months with 1K down payment, which amounts to 21700 $, it should be 300 $, when I questioned how it is 0%, and he had no answer, what he said to me was, you are getting 7K per month and you are seeing 45 $ extra.

In short, this place is full of lies, no ethics, no manners, if this is their sales, god knows how will be there service.",1.0

632,"May 30, 2014","I bought my new Toyota Highlander at the end of December. I waited to review this dealership because I wanted to be fair and hopefully my attitude towards them changed. It has not. First, for the last 2 years, my 2008 Highlander Hybrid limited had been having problems with the gas tank (won't fill up) then the braking system was malfunctioning. After numerous attempts to repair & thousands of dollars spent, the vehicle still wasn't repaired. Refunds were not issued in hopes to ""eventually"" figure out the problems & repair them. The braking system went out on a weekend evening, leaving me & my children stranded. We had the vehicle towed to Carlsbad. 

I requested the Sales Team & Services department work together because of all of the problems I had over the last 2 years. They did not accommodate. They knew ""they had me"" because my vehicle was in the shop. It was not worth repairing. The sales team wouldn't budge in price; I had to show them vehicles at Mossy to get them to budge. Moreover, once we had finally made a deal, I requested new car mats to be included, that was denied, and they wanted $200 for my old car mats. They ended up reducing the value of my car because I refused to pay for more all weather mats, a cargo net and my surf racks (that I already owned!). When I was transferring my 6 year old car mats over to my brand new Highlander, I requested my old car mats be sprayed off. The salesman looked at me like I was crazy-why should I even have to ask to have dirty old all weather car mats sprayed off before I put them in a brand new $37,000 vehicle? I was shocked that I would even have to ask this! I had to threaten to walk away from the entire deal, have my car towed elsewhere (Mossy) just to have clean car mats. They finally sprayed off my mats. 

Since purchasing my vehicle, I have been working with Mossy, and they have given me excellent customer service. They have taken excellent care of my vehicle. I regret not towing my vehicle & just working w/Mossy. Lesson learned. ",2.4

634,"February 16, 2014","I had an interesting experience.  I live in the area so I thought it would make sense to go local and see what Toyota Carlsbad could do reference a new car purchase.  I used to work with a salesman at Carlsbad who always cut out the bull and got down to business and sell a car at the best price out there.  My wife, two children, and I went to Toyota Carlsbad about (3) hours prior to closing to attempt to purchase our vehicle.  When we got there I had an appt. with Alex Ordonez.  He was friendly upon greeting but that was about it.  Has anyone ever got the feeling that they are a thorn in someones side?  Well this is how 98% of the contact went.  We felt like we were a huge burden to Mr. Ordonez and that we were wasting his time.  Rolling eyes and heavy breathing sighs indicated to us that his goal was to get us out of his office and off the lot as quick as possible on his clock (keeping in mind the store closed in 2-3 hours).  In the end, we both felt like we were a waste of his time and efforts.  We felt like we were a burden to him.  We also felt that he did not have any real interest in providing us with answers to our simple questions and that it was a chore to drive around the block in two different vehicles for a test drive.  Making a car purchase is somewhat of a big decision for a family who is about to spend 20-30k on a new vehicle.

My suggestion: show additional respect and care for your customers and show interest / enthusiasm.  What did I do?  Well, I went right back to Kevin Edgett at Toyota of Escondido and purchased a new vehicle in 2 hours the next eve.  He not only offered me and BEAT Toyota Carlsbad, but he cut to the chase and gave me the real price for add-ons such as leather seating, etc.  He doesn't bull, loves his job, and it shows.  In the end, I left with a better deal, supreme service, and appreciation as a returned customer.

My family and I won't be visiting Toyota Carlsbad anymore due to this experience most likely.  Being a fleet manager, I would expect Mr. Ordonez to show more of a representation of the dealership.  I warn those who go there and to avoid the vulture sales atmosphere.  Show some respect ",1.4

We had a good night and a pretty fast deal ..Italian Nicole was upfront and honest in the Finance dept. which I appreciate and will go back to her for any 'extras' I might need down the road.

Ended up in a 2014 Platinum Crewmax Tundra which had just came out and was delivered from plant only a couple days before I got it so Marcos and I were both excited to see it, even Nicole came out to take a look at it. Special thanks to Marcos for pairing the phone with the truck, as I probably still would be without using this cool feature. He also got me the window sticker when the truck went to prep and follow up calls and emails. Marcos is a great guy and Carlsbad was the most friendly dealer I've experienced so far.

637,"September 15, 2013","So professional, so customer-service oriented.  I've been in the market for a new car for a while and I took my time making a decision.  I solicited numerous internet quotes and Carlsbad was least expensive by a couple hundred dollars.  The only issue was, Carlsbad is a bit of a hike from my home.  So I went to a number of closer dealerships to see if they would match his quote.  Nope, they wouldn't.  Although they were happy to waste my time by pretending they were interested in matching the quote and then explaining to me how they were still giving me a great deal even though that made no logical sense because they weren't matching the best (Carlsbad's) deal.  Anyway, perhaps more importantly or just as importantly, none of the others came anywhere close to being as professional or customer-service oriented.  It was worth every moment of the round-trip from here to Carlsbad to get the car.  Jonathan Casselman was the internet sales person with whom I dealt and he is professional, friendly, and knowledgeable.  In the week before I went down to Carlsbad, Jonathan was responsive both via email and by phone.  He was straightforward with me about what the out-the-door price would be and how the sale would go.  I told him I would be at the dealership at a certain time and, when my husband and I arrived, he was walking towards us to greet us (assuming we were us because he knew when we were coming, I guess!).  This was so different from my frustrating experience at other dealerships where I would deal with someone on the phone who was nowhere to be found when I actually took the time away from work or family to go to the dealership, even though I had told them I was on my way!  Also, Mandy the finance person at Carlsbad was fantastic.  She explained all of the paperwork and the monthly payments clearly, and was very low-key about the ""extras.""  She explained the paint and interior protection and all that stuff in a knowledgeable, professional way and did not pressure us when we declined all of it.  The whole experience with Carlsbad Toyota left me feeling great about the transaction and my new car.  I got a great price for a car I am excited about; they had exactly the color combination I wanted, and I was treated respectfully.  A positive, successful experience.

At Toyota Carlsbad I actually felt like they WANTED our business and that they WANTED us to be a return customer. When I purchase something major like a car I want the people selling it to me to realize that this is a major decision involving a lot of hard-earned money and that is not something I entered into lightly. Not all car dealers understand this; Toyota Carlsbad gets it. Duff and David took us through the process of getting the car and outfitting just as we wanted and did so with absolute professionalism without losing the ""friendliness factor"". We were not rushed and were constantly asked if there was anything else that could be done. The part of buying a car I hate the most is the financial/loan part; Rick took us through the financials with great care, speed, and honesty and made it a pleasant experience.

On top of everything, our Toyota's have been the most reliable cars we have ever owned. Well-made and engineered with the driver and passengers in mind you cannot go wrong. Getting to buy it from Toyota Carlsbad is a bonus on top of this.


I would recommend that anyone looking to buy a car (new or used; we have done both) give Toyota Carlsbad a look; buy once and you won't go anywhere else!",5.0
654,"May 18, 2013","I was in need of a new vehicle and knew I wanted a Toyota 4 door truck. I had a maximum payment budget and did not want to settle for anything else. Shaun Wright walked me through the used Toyota lot and found a beautiful truck, we could not make the payments match my budget. He then walked me over to the NEW Toyota lot and we found the exact truck I wanted but was almost sure I could not afford it...it was BRAND NEW AND GORGEOUS! He worked with his manager Mr. Boone and Mandi Grudek the finance manager and came up with a perfect plan that WORKED for me. I drove off the lot that day with my gorgeous NEW Toyota...the exact one I wanted and could afford! Thank you Shaun, Mr. Boone and Mandi for above and beyond friendliness and customer service!

The Toyota Carlsbad team was very friendly, professional, passive and exceeded our expectations which made this a easy and enjoyable experience. I am very thankful that I set foot on the Carlsbad Toyota lot , cause this was top notch professional customer service. Thank you Duff Joy, Elma Alfaraj and the rest of the Toyota of Carlsbad team.

I will consider purchasing another in the near future.

660,"April 15, 2013","I am very excited to write this review. I had gone to Toyota of Carlsbad for my original car, a Corolla and was so happy with the honest service I received. So, this time I expected nothing less and got it! We went in looking for a bigger car (baby on the way!) and found the Rav4 and fell in love. Omar helped us with the selection (couldn't be happier with the model we chose - XLE AWD) and was very realistic with us about pricing and what to expect. We are so in love with this car and have already enjoyed a nice road trip in it! It is so efficient and is just all around a great family car -- very pleased!

Aaron was our financial advisor and went over all the aspects of payment, etc. and helped us with our GAP insurance. He was very pleasant to work with and again, was very honest and straight forward.

Overall, we had an amazing experience and will definitely be going to Toyota for any of our future needs.

We had actually gone to a different dealership earlier in the day but were so dissatisfied with the customer service that we started looking elsewhere. I am so happy we decided to drive down to Carlsbad because it was like night and day!
Mandy was also great to work with - incredibly friendly, helpful, and knowledgable.

662,"March 25, 2013","Mr. Joy is a valuable asset to the Toyota dealership.  After very negative experiences with other Toyotal dealers, I had serious reservation about giving any additional business to Toyota.  Meeting and dealing with Mr. Joy, his professionalism tempered my harsh feelings for Toyota.  Mr. Joy is honest, no-nonsense and an excellent representative for the Toyota dealership.  He discussed in depth several car choices and did not try to sell me something I did not want and that is why you got my business.  Toyota certainly needs more people like Mr. Joy that will translate to more sales and repeat-customers.

701,"August 05, 2012","I had an excellent experience at Toyota Carlsbad. As a first time car buyer (yes, I have never owed a car in nearly 19 years), I was looking for a specific model, 2011 Ford Fusion Sport.  Using Pentagon Federal Credit Union's Buyer Program, it searched and found that Toyota Carlsbad had the exact model, color and features that I was looking for in my first car.  Ironic that it was a Toyota dealership with its rival sitting in its lot.  Within 24 hours, Ernan Northrup, salesperson, had contacted me through email to setup an appointment.  There were other dealers (I searched in Oakland, North Hollywood and Hawthorn) and vehicles that peaked my interested, but I ran into the horror stories I have heard about regarding car dealerships and salespeople.  However, my experience with Ernan was opposite of the horror stories.  He was honest, professional, not pushy, and a laidback persona (must be s San Diego thing) that allowed me to enjoy my Ford Fusion Sport.  After the test drive and discussion, I was sold on the Fusion Sport and purchased it right there on the spot.  Also, Ernan went the extra mile in the following areas: (1) helped me get a better car insurance rate; (2) put additional gas in the tank; (3) helped me drop off the rental car I arrived at the dealership with at a nearby Hertz rental car.  Ernan provided me with the care and experience that I appreciate when shopping.  Even though I purchased a Ford rather than a Toyota, Ernan was indifferent to the purchase and conducted himself with integrity, courtesy, helpful and professionalism that is lacking in today's American society.  Also, Michael Hazlehurst, Finance Manager, was excellent in walking me through the paperwork related to my car purchase.  He was professional and courtesy in dealing with me and questions.  Even though my financing was through my credit union and not in-house, he provided me with the same kind of service.  Thanks again for the experience. ",5.0

Knew what questions to ask to make a speedy and accurate appraisal of what we needed/wanted and had the car we wanted in front of our eyes in 10 minutes (vs wandering around the lot kicking tires). Did the paperwork as we chatted; answered more questions; got approval in minutes. Very savvy sales person.
Mandi answered more questions about paperwork needed and need for additional maintenance/protection/alarm,etc. She really knows her job as sales person and paperwork guru.
David Corona had the car running and waiting when we finished the paperwork. Set up our phone, had the alarm system up, and gave us a quick ""how it all works"" tour of essential systems and hardware. Will be taking him up on his offer to consult on how to questions that have come up since. 
I would put any of my friends in these folks capable hands.

728,"December 09, 2011","My wife, daughter and I shopped at Toyota Carlsbad for a new car for my soon-to-be16 year old daughter. We were greeted by Scott Busby and he took great care in listening to what kind of car we were looking for.  We didn't have a model in mind so his work was a bit challenging. He took the time to listen to not only my wife and I, but my daughter.  He explained to her different things about the cars and things she should be interested in as a new driver, of any make or model. He also took time showing her about the engine and how she should maintain her car, whichever brand she may end up buying. He also showed her how to properly apply the brakes of the car to avoid an accident and offered several helpful points for her to be a better driver.  While we ultimately ended up buying a different brand automobile, the experience I had with Scott was the best experience I've had in 25 years of buying experience. In fact, my daughter commented how different the experience with Scott was as compared to other salespeople. He made her feel comfortable, educated her and made the experience not an intimatating one like so many others.

743,"August 15, 2011","My husband and I were looking for a new Toyota vehicle. After lots of research, we were ready to narrow down our model choices. We were met in the parking lot of Toyota Carlsbad by Scott Busby. He was very patient with us, as we checked out 4 models, and very knowledgeable about each. None of them really fit the bill, and he suggested looking at a Prius. We are very eco-conscious, but didn't like the comfort of the old Prius (pre 2010). He said that we must sit in one to appreciate the changes in the new model. Well, it was amazing! It was very comfortable, quiet, and drove like a dream. We still needed some time to research the Prius on our own, and Scott respected that, and we thanked him for his time. It only took us 3 days to make our decision (very quick for us!), and we knew if we bought a Prius, we wanted to buy from Scott, as long as the price was right for us. We were never pressured or pushed into anything. Scott was patient, up front and honest. He's very warm, and really seems to care about his clients. He spent 1 1/2 hours going over everything Prius,from the electric engine to the radio. His knowledge of the workings of cars is amazing, as well as his attention to detail about every aspect of the car. We're so glad that Scott introduced us to our Prius, because we wouldn't have looked at one otherwise!

744,"August 12, 2011","My 2003 Ford Explorer died out over a week ago with 170,000 miles on it.  I was truly overwhelmed with stress.  It was the last thing I wanted to worry about... Anyway, that lead me to start searching for another car for my family.  I had called around and got prices from all different dealers.  Almost every dealership I called had great prices just like Toyota of Carlsbad, but the real reason why I went with Toyota of Carlsbad is because of their excellent customer service.  Duff Joy went above and beyond with service.  He not only treated me with respect as a human being with a need to get into a vehicle, but he was real with me...  My credit score was not the best and I didnt have much to put down but he really didnt make that as a focal point...  Yes, those things are important but it wasnt the focus of that day... 
Duff worked out a deal where not only it was good with the bank, but it was also meeting my needs...  Thank you DUFF JOY... Thank you Toyota of Carlsbad.  I walked out the lot with my beautiful 2009 CAMRY with really low miles.. I am so happy with my CAMRY.  It runs so smooth....  I love it!

So, if you are looking for a vehicle today - STOP LOOKING.... Go see DUFF JOY and his team...  Duff is AWESOME!  If you are worried about your credit score or what to put as a down payment, just go and STOP WORRYING!!  They will work something out for you...  And I aint going to lie, if it doesnt work out- Duff will tell you straight up front, so you dont spend hours and hours and hours of waiting to hear back from who knows who... Just giving you the run around for no reason (like that Ford Dealership in Carlsbad.... DONT GO THERE!!)... I can honestly say for my 2003 Ford Explorer, it took 3 days to get into it (many hours wasted by waiting... and the Ford Dealer that I went to kept giving me the run around....)  

My Overall experience of purchasing a vehicle last week at TOYOTA of CARLSBAD was the BEST...  It was FAST (3 hours or less- because I was test driving + paperwork)... EASY, NO STRESS, NO PRESSURE and RED CARPET SERVICE (Excellent Customer service)...  YOU CANT BEAT THAT!

747,"August 05, 2011","Was looking to change my 06 Tacoma to a brand new Tacoma.  Went to the dealer and found the truck I was looking for, dark grey, lift kit, rims, and step up bars.  Did not make the deal right away but discussed options with Mrs Elizabeth.  Had to leave for 2 weeks on business.  While on business went to the local dealer to see what they were offering.  Called Carlsbad and they said they would beat that price and they did!  Came back from the business trip and starting talking with Scott Busby.  Because of doing my previous talkings with the Carlsbad, I felt comfortable working with them.  The dealer gave me the best price they could, yes we went back and forth but they were respectful and willing to work knowing that I was serious about buying a vehicle.

There were only a few issues that I think would better the dealerships and the individual dealers.  (1) Trust a customer when they say they will be there at a certain time, 1 text message to confirm is fine.  Multiple texts in one day confirming the same time over and over again was annoying and made me not want to work with that dealer.  (2) Do not throw out all your previous DealerRater.com evals.  Ask the customer to fill one out, just say that you keep them all and if they want to read them they are available.  It seemed a little bit arrogant of a dealer to go through all of them with the customer, like saying look at me and how good I am.  My personal opinion, dealers should either talk about the vehicle, life, or common interests not pervious sales.  We, the customers dont care about your previous sales. 

Overall, loved working with the dealership and the dealers.  I love my truck and the services that you provided.   ",4.8

Mr Maurizio TABAR received us and we finally get the new car!
My wife and I were impressed by the great professionalism , dedication, and wit of this quite young professional (Mr TABAR): explanations were given, features described, precision and seriousness!
Delivery day arrived and Mr TABAR greeted us on the parking lot.
The financial manager was also very efficient and helped us with the humongous paperwork to be filled.

Our suggestion nevertheless, don't put a person with no-face and behind a tinted glass in charge of the price negociation: it tells a lot and put the customer in a bad position!
In my case, i firstly open myself to Mr TABAR on the situation, explaining that this situation would prevent the deal to come through.
Thanks to Mr TABAR, we were able to have the gentleman presented to us and we could finish the negociation.

It is very important because, and I felt it strongly: the lack of respect that this induced would have made me quit the dealership instantly!

Again, my rating of this dealership goes mainly to Mr TABAR,whose dedication, professionalism deserve recognition,, appreciation and reward!

I hope that this rating will be conveyed also to him

He still tries to get her to look at an '09 because it is SUCH a good deal (not really, 14K for an '09 Corolla is not that great). Reluctantly, he shows her the '10s. He then proceeds to utterly confuse us by taking us all around the lot. My mom asks if the '11 Corollas are out yet. He says no. Suspiciously, he shows us some Corollas in the back that look oddly different. But then he whisks us away back to the '10s before we got a good look. Later, I look online and find out those were the '11s.  Why the deception? Either he doesn't know his stock or he is outright lying to us. Here is an example of what he told us regarding color: ""Here is the silver color. You don't want a dark color, it will get dirty easily. But if you want black, I have a beautiful black one over here. Let me show you that one!"" Confusing double-speak like this the whole time. We left this dealership more confused than when we arrived. We were completely lost on the different trims and how they are different. If I decide to buy a Toyota in the future, I will definitely not buy from here after this awful experience. I have no complaints about Service, I have been there once twice with no problems.",1.6
768,"January 24, 2011","I had the best experience possible coming to this dealership. I had gone to a few other dealers and they were not willing to work with me at all and the interest was insane. My father had bought a few cars from Toyota Carlsbad before so i thought i would test it out. I was very glad they did because i got to buy my very first brand new car and it was for a price that i could afford! Dana Greenlaw helped me out so much with trying to get me the best financing possible. Scott Busby was very knowledgeable about his cars and answered every question i had. He also made sure i knew how to work every cool feature in my car before i drove off the lot. Also, Nicole Manganiello took care of all the paper work afterwards. She was the nicest person and was very flexible with letting me have time to get all my information collected. Everyone here gave excellent customer service and was so nice in working with me money-wise and every way possible. I cant thank these people enough. I will always come back her for all of my future cars and i highly recommend it for any potential new car buyers!

Thank you!

769,"January 22, 2011","Ghassan Asfour was the the salesman who helped me with my choice in leasing a new Camry. He was very helpful,informative, never pushy and beyond a pleasure to work with. I feel Toyota Carlsbad was fair in the trade in value on my Rav4 and I believe Ghassan worked for me to help put me in a car that met my needs within my price range. No they never tell you to factor in an alarm until you are in the finnance office...L.O.L. But.. I never felt I was being pushed into anything I did not need as I have been in the past but rather informed as to what few things would be in my best interest. Sharon in finnance was super helpful and an absolute joy to work with even at the end of a very busy day on New Years Eve. This was by far my best dealer experience. If I choose a Toyota for my next car I'll go back to Toyota Carlsbad and ask for Mr. Asfour. I would suggest this dealership and Ghassan Asfour to any of my friends.     ",5.0
770,"January 14, 2011","Kevin is a stand up guy and very customer service oriented.  I always feel I can trust him, though I don't always like what he's telling me, I trust it is needed service.
Wayde does a great job of insuring the service is correct and needed and I have never had to return for rework with him or his crew.",4.6

I drive 52 miles, one way, to have my family fleet of vehicles serviced at Toyota of Carlsbad. The service is very good and well worth the drive. My service representative, Kevin Skinner, is the best, hands down. I have owned many Toyota vehicles over the past 33 years, as well as extended family members who are also Toyota owners.

The key to good service can best be explained with a comparison. The service department is the orchestra, the service representative the conductor, the vehicle owner the audience. Toyota of Carlsbad has many talented musicians back in the service bay and I have never had them misplay a single note on my vehicles. The touchstone between me and the service personnel is my service representative, Kevin Skinner; a service conductor extraordinaire. I trust him and have never had occasion to feel otherwise. 

Great dealership, great vehicles, outstanding people. As Toyota says,'' Toyota, Moving Forward''. Forward, 52 miles at a time.",5.0
772,"December 15, 2010","I was greeted right away. My salesperson was very upbeat, not pushy, allowed me to test drive 3 cars -one of them twice without any pressure. He was very patient. He was knowledgeable about the various vehicles and answered all my questions. I probably asked the same questions twice, but he was very kind and friendly. When I was waiting for him to get answers and then to get the car ready to delivery to me the other people in the dealership were friendly as well. The finance person that did all the paperwork (sorry I don't remember his name) was very organized and friendly. Overall, my experience with this dealership was really wonderful. The bathroom was very clean, well stocked, and had a pleasant smell. The waiting room was very nice too. The dealership as a whole was very clean and organized. I would recommend this dealership and this salesperson to others and, in fact, already have.",5.0
773,"August 29, 2008","I dealt directly with the fleet department when I bought my truck with an internet quote, bypassing the sales staff. Duff was great to deal with. He didn't put any pressure on anyone. When he wrote the numbers on the paper, he didn't even make it large and exaggerated. He was mostly quiet during the test drive so I could hear the engine. He didn't do what many salespeople do which is keep talking and trying to get the customer to get overly excited and trying to shake up their reasonable thinking. We drove on the freeway and went on some hills. I got to test the brakes and acceleration 0 to 60mph.

I got a 2008 Toyota and choosing 0% APR worked best for me. That was made clear and even the finance guy was easy to deal with. He showed us the recommended additions like the extended warranty, Low Jack, and a few other options. But he calmly let us know right away that we have time to decide on those options. The whole process from arriving on the lot to driving off with my new truck took about 2 hours but it wasn't rushed in any way.

I won't go into details in what I paid and what exact trim I got. But let's just say it would make Edmunds.com proud. Just call them and ask Omar or Duff to email you a quote on the vehicle you want.",5.0
774,"December 30, 2007",This dealership strives to please its customers.  The service department recommends only the repairs that are needed.  The service writers will help you to save money as much as they can.  It is obvious that the dealership cares about its customers.,4.0
