318,14-Jul-18,"I have been trying to get some resolution on my RS4 's service contract that I bought from this dealer and so far nothing positive has been happening. I spoke to Mike Moye who sold me the contract and Thomas who is a Finance Manager. I emailed Marin Delgado who is the GM and there was no response for several days so decided to call him. Luckily, I was able to have a brief conversation with him because he was busy I guess. He said somebody would call me later in the afternoon to help me out. Unfortunately, nobody called. I wonder what kind of CORE VALUES this dealership has. I guess it all starts from the TOP. If the main man cannot follow thru what he says then so as the followers. I work for a fortune 500 company as well and I know for a fact we take care of our customers to be in business. I'm surprised how this dealer stay competitive with the rest of the other dealers.  I hope these guys realize what they are doing and standby their products that they sell.",1
451,31-Dec-17,"I brought my Audi Q7 for a fuel flange recall repair. 3 days later. I went to pick up my car and the driver seat and the side mirrors were adjusted from my usual settings. I went ahead and tried to adjust it back and the driver's side won't budge. It was around 630PM and Natalie, my service advisor was no longer around so I left my SUV for them to check it. Same thing happened about 4 years ago while I was picking up my vehicle. The passenger side mirror had the same issue when I was picking it up. I was told to come back the next day since the advisor had gone home. When I came back the next day, I was told that they won't cover repairs since I took it out from the lot. They said they spoke to Brock Temple(Manager) and there's is nothing that they can do. Ever since then, I had been bringing my car to Audi Circle and for every service, I started a habit of checking my mirrors during pick-up. I never had a problem so far until I had this last service with Audi Pacific. 

I came in the next day and I was let in at the manager's office. I spoke to Brock and Natalie and told them that I brought it in working. The fact that somebody adjusted it means that it was working when the car was in their lot. I was told excuses, susch as “car can break at anytime” and was even told to wait while they check with Audi Circle. Brock made a sarcastic comment ""I hope you're not going to blame me about your battery too!"" Since they were suggesting to replace my battery. Since I need to leave because I still have business appointments, I asked them if they will cover the repair. I was told by Brock ""I'm simply not buying your story"". I don't know why they held me to stay if this was the case. He told me that I can pay for the part and they will install it for me as suggested by the Service Foreman.  I told him that I am really frustrated  since this was the second time that it happened and left the dealership. I left a message with Natalie to call me when the part comes in. It's been more than a week and I still have not received any call back.  I expected a better customer service from this dealership. I thought Audi will have a higher standard compared to other Automakers. So far, I had better customer service at South Bay BMW.",1
594,07-Dec-15,"Not worth your time. 
The sales person not only once, but twice went back on her words. Its not unusual for car sales person to haggle on the price however what made me feel so bad was she quoted on a price twice and went back each time with some lame excuse ""Oh! I meant that"", ""No, I included that"". How can someone make some unprofessional remarks when we are talking about out-of-the-door pricing?",1
674,23-Jul-06,"July 15 and 16, 2006: Went to buy a wagon and our salesman (very friendly) showed us an 2006 A4 Avant that had a sticker on the front indicating ""8000 off.""  He indicated that this was a great deal, so after thinking about the car overnight, we went back to Pacific Audi to start the purchase process.  After discussing the payments three times, the sales manager came out and told us that the sticker was a mistake and they would not honor the price.  I called the general manager the next day and he apologized, but reiterated the fact that car dealers are allowed to make mistakes and the price would not be honored.  To the GM's credit he did try to say he'd cut me a deal in the future, but that was after insinuating that I was trying to take advantage of them.  They've lost a customer and I would not recommend shopping there for a new or used Audi.",1.5
338,15-Jun-18,"Biggest thieves...
Brought our Audi in for the 1st service and they had to fix a whole list of items (which in itself is ridiculous since it is a new car).  They gave me a loaner for 5 days (took all week just fix everything).  I parked the car out on the street one evening and it got dirty along with some palm tree sap.  I returned the loaner and picked up my Audi and they charged me $160 because the loaner was returned dirty!!!!  They claim that they now have to detail the car which is a crock of xxxx since I had 2 other cars on the street that night as well with tree sap and I washed both the cars today and they came completely clean with no marks or blemishes.  Stay away from this dealership....they are dishonest and will rip you off.",1.6
551,18-Mar-17,"It takes me a lot to get my xxx together to write a bad review about a product or service! But.. man ... This place is horrible! 

I sent a request to test drive a car (Mid December 2016) and they called me the next day and I purchased the car on the same day! Everything was nice, smooth, and friendly as long as they want to take your money! So what was the problem? ....

Episode 0: Finance Rate
I had two options to purchase the car! Cash out or finance! Since I have a good credit score, I decided to finance my car. They offered me 3.9% which was surprisingly high! I asked them to check with CRB or BoA and as I was expecting, the rate was dropped to 2.39%!
At the end of the day, the difference between 2.39% or 3.9% would not hurt me financially and I am pretty sure would not make any difference for the dealership... BUT they did not do their best to find me the best deal and it should have triggered an alarm for me!

Episode 1: License Plate
The previous owner had a customized license plate which he/she took it with himself/herself and the dealer put a placard inside the frame. Since the car did not have a license plate the dealer is supposed to submit all the necessary documents to DMV within 48 hours for permanent license plate and registration! About two months after I purchased the car, I called DMV and they said they have not submitted anything for my license plate! I contacted the dealer and they said that they thought that the license is under the dealer's placard!!!!!!!! That was funny for me because they were the ones who explained me about the customized license plate and all the related fees! They emailed me the ""Application for license plate"" on February 20th, to complete my application process .... As of now, the registration is voided as it is only valid for 90 days and I have to rent a car to go to work!!!!!

Episode 2: Extended Warranty
I paid for the ""Platinum Coverage"", the only extended warranty that they offered to me. About two weeks later I figured out that there are better warranties available in the market. Therefore, I called them and canceled the warranty as it had 1 month free cancellation period! At the time, they told me that it would take 6-8 weeks for the money to hit my account! 12 weeks after ... neither I nor my bank has not received the money yet!

Episode 3: Customer Service
Someone called me from the dealership today (March 18th, 2017) to HELP ME, with all the problems .... BUT he dropped the call in the middle of our conversation! This is indeed what made me to write this long review about my experience! All the money related issues can be fixed, but you cannot disrespect someone and just drop the call! 

Episode 4: Legal Action
I am going to open a legal case against this dealership and I will update you onits status.",1.6
631,18-Oct-11,"Purchased a so-called NEW 2012 Audi Q5, it has 2 dents caused by the dealership that I didn't notice until 3 weeks later. They did not perform a walkthrough of the car and because it was night time it would not have been spotted due to the location. Spoke to Fred and Bernie about it, very nice guys but they and the dealership refuse to assume any responsibility. Even after submitting solid evidence that it occurred on their premises. Spoke to Audi corporate and they don't want to do anything because it's a dealership issue. I paid for a new pristine vehicle received damage goods. Shop elsewhere where sales and ownership walk the walk and not just talk the talk. This was my first and last Audi I ever purchase.",2.3
637,02-May-11,"BEWARE OF....I purchased (with confidence, I thought)a Certified used 2008 Q7 from Pacific Audi (Torrance)in June of 2010, the car was nice, sales and financing was OK. BUT when I wanted to trade the vehicle in March of 2011 somewhere else, I was shocked to find out that the vehicle had been painted on the right front fender and door,hence being worth $2000 less vs the no paint work value. In disbilief,I went back to Pacific to ask for an explanation. There, the salesman and his manager, without skipping a beat said that ""the car probably had some scratch or something, needing touching up""! followed by presenting a Carfax report that did not show any damage report. This was supposed to make this a non issue, even though they had previous knowledge of it and chose not to disclose it at the time of sale. To make matters worse I had them appraise the vehicle themselves and their figure of $26000, was $3000 less than CARMAX offered me on an outright purchase, just 1/2 mile down the road. I contacted Audi customer relations for assistance and after a week of ""investigation"" all they had to say was that as long as the Carfax is OK and there is no major structural damage, this would not be a disclosure item. Here I am, having paid good money for damaged goods which I cannot re-sell or trade in without taking a beating for what I had no knowledge of. If I had my guards up as if I was buying from any corner car lot then I would have had it checked by a third party but the ""Audi Certified"" thing, ended up to be the catch.
Also just a word of advice for the dealership management;

""There is a difference between what is legal and what is moral"". We'll see how the court rules.",2.3
644,17-Jan-11,"I bought my car on 7/23/10 and today is 1/16/11.  I am still waiting for my registration.  If I knew it would take this long, I would have never signed the DMV power of attorney.  This delay is unnacceptable.  I have been working with Finance to get this resolved as soon as possible, but it has taken too long.  I'm very frustrated and disappointed with the overall service.   ",2.4
244,19-Oct-18,"When dropping my car off for service, I’m usually greeted/escorted in once I pull my car up to the service bay. This didn’t happen on this occasion. I had an appointment for weeks, yet when I walked in to the service department, I was told to wait in the waiting area by one employee. 10-15 minutes go by and another employee asks me if I’ve been helped to which I say I have not. I finally get help and get my car serviced. One of the issues I wanted addressed was the squeaking of my brakes. When I returned to pick up my car I was told that there was a little rust that they cleaned and my brakes should not be squeaking. Well, my brakes are still squeaking today.",3.4
617,11-Oct-12,"I had mixed experience with this dealership. I think this is as good a dealership as any other. Just make sure that you know your facts about the car & its service package you want before your visit; otherwise, I have a feeling that you'll miss something and they'll miss some important details. The interesting part is that they didn't seem to miss them on purpose.

I went there shopping for an A6 CPO because it had all the features that I wanted and it was close the my target price range. I was greeted by Rick and he was an ernest sales person. The test drive process was smooth and he didn't give me pressure. The offer process was slightly long but the deal eventually came through. Making it through the sales process was just half of it though.

Two curious items were later discovered and eventually fixed by their sales and service departments: i) keys were missing and ii) tire size was wrong for the wheels. You'd have thought that when they checked their CPO inspection list, they would have discovered the problems. If I hadn't read the list myself, then I would have not been offered the replacements.

The service staff and the finance lady are highly commendable. I think they kept the cars of their customers really well. The service manager was fast and direct in responding to problems. The finance lady Rosa knew exactly what she's talking about.

Overall, it was a good purchasing experience. I recommend shopping here after doing some homework on the car you want.",3.6
9,18-Sep-19,"When we finally found a suitable car that met the agreed upon price, everything went well.  The problem was finding a car, but you eventually did and we like it very much. ",3.8
22,02-Sep-19,"Sales staff met with seemed inexperienced, not as knowledgeable of product.  Chris got  the job done, but was seemingly not as people comfortable.  Did not see we needed more interaction, info of process and vehicle technical assistance. Though pleased with the deal we were very frustrated with the sales support.",3.8
673,13-Dec-06,"I love that this dealer offers loaner Audis as opposed to the Fords/Nissans you get from Enterprise/Hertz from other dealers.  I did have a problem with the lack of customer service when I called.  I would frequently get recorded messages stating no one was available when I called.  Colin was very on top of things though.  He wasn't exactly what I'd call ""super friendly,"" but he'd call to update me on what was going on.  The service itself wasn't always done completely, but I believe that was due to Audi's lack of knowledge of what was wrong with the car, as opposed to that of this specific dealer's.",3.8
12,13-Sep-19,"My only pain point was the car wash I received after my service. They did not bother to wipe down the dashboard, vacuum sand off my seats, or adequately degrease/clean my rims. It looked lazy. The video service rundown that my tech included was a nice touch - very thorough! ",4
54,20-Jul-19,"They performed an excellent cleaning and mechanical prep of the used car I purchased.  The sales people, finance people, and used car manager were very pleasant.",4
66,30-Jun-19,"Low key, didn’t oversell and push. Quick and fair. Great salesman and sales manager. Weak finance guy. Great prep of the car. Quick and detailed very nicely. No explanation of how anything worked- because you are an Audi shop, not a Porsche shop. 
I had a very positive experience and would recommend Gino to anyone. ",4
112,23-Apr-19,Took longer than expected for regular service  but otherwise a good experience . Was checked in promptly and updated from time to time about progress on service. ,4
234,03-Nov-18,Service experience was very efficient. Drop off and pick up occurred quickly and without any delay. However there was absolutely no explanation of what would be done to my vehicle or what was done during the service. I have the prepaid maintenance plan so I figure everything required was done but the last time they sent me a full inspection video of my vehicle on the lift (same dealership) so this visit fell short for sure by that standard. ,4
410,15-Mar-18,"Service Adviser Natalie is exceptionally friendly, responsive, and appears to be technically competent as well. Making the appointment was easy.  One star off for: 1. Told Service was ""unusually busy and backed up"" - ergo car would not be ready on the day brought in (extra day required).  2. Scheduled Audi loaner not available (same reason); provided with Enterprise car instead - required extra ""process"" and an additional one hour. 3. Most important, Service was unable to determine cause of repeated left rear TPMS light - tires rotated and I'm to drive it to see which, if any, tire/wheel caused TPMS light to come on yet again.   ",4
64,09-Jul-19,Michael was very pleasant and helpful.  He was patient as I called other mechanics to compare service prices and make a decision.  He even expedited the servicing of my vehicle and managed to fit in a car wash.  Extremely professional. ,4.2
108,27-Apr-19,"great customer service.  The 2,000.00 price however for light bulb exchange was ridiculous.  Everyone I told this too thought the same.. the only issue was the price for service  ",4.2
147,10-Mar-19,"Took my car in for the second time for an oul change.  Firts oil change experience was awsome.   Second oil change was awsome as well.  They also provides me with a loaner car.  Thinking about buying the Q5 in the future.   Also, had my bumber fixed and did an excellent job with the repair.  Thank you Audi Torrance.   keep up the great work and service",4.2
159,19-Feb-19,"Anel is very friendly and gave us proper explanations. I was very satisfied with her support and put faith in her great work. Thank you, Anel!!!",4.2
174,25-Jan-19,I was quite pleased that the work done on my car took less time than estimated. The staff was extremely friendly.  Hopefully all future services will goes as well.,4.2
305,01-Aug-18,"I had such a great experience with my previous A3 thought I'd try it again. Loving the design enhancements to this years A3 with the exception of two main items. First; the idiotic start stop function deserves an award for the year's most annoying feature. Second; the keyless entry also feels gimmicky. It's not like a finger print reader that would truly improve security. You still need a fob for entry/startup and this feature feels like an after thought because there's still a useless physical metal key on the fob. A minor note, the trunk space feels a little smaller than my 2016 but despite these issues I still believe the brand continues to lead the market in engineering, design and value. Solid dealer location and felt taken care of by the sales team. ",4.2
530,10-Oct-17,My car was being tested for possible excess oil consumption as I had at one point adding oil every 800-900 miles.  This test showed my A4 was within spec.,4.2
17,05-Sep-19,"Slightly disappointed.  Agreed to purchase the car on Saturday and gave a deposit.  Came back on Tuesday and none of the paperwork had been completed and the finance manager handling my matter was out for the day.  The other finance manager was busy, so I told my salesman, Gino, that I would be back on Tuesday.  Just after I left I got a call from the finance person that they could help me now.  Came back, and felt extremely rushed with the paperwork and especially the extended warranties.  I left the car there and called Wednesday and wanted to go over the warranties I purchased and the finance manager sat down with me and deleted those that I would not likely use.  Went to take the car home and even those this was a CPO car, the sim card was missing.  I was told they would take care of it.  Received a call today from the first finance guy to assure everything was fine and when I mentioned the SIM card they knew nothing about it.  Hopefully they will resolve this issue shortly. The Best part is I owned an S6, and I am glad to know that Broc is still with this dealer.",4.4
143,16-Mar-19,"Work was completed in 2 days but no issues with a loaner car until recall issue was fixed. Great service. Oscar (don’t remember his last name) the service associate, was very nice and helpful.",4.4
146,12-Mar-19,"Was in and out fairly fast for a 25K checkup.  Worked with Henry Esqueda.  Worked with him before.  Always professional and courteous.  In fact, all the personnel I've dealt with have been friendly and courteous.

154,03-Mar-19,Having a service contact as reliable and competent as Natalie makes all the difference.   she made the last visit seamless. Thank you and see you when I check out the new electric car!,4.4
217,20-Nov-18,"The service center experience is always a great one. They go above and beyond to make you feel comfortable while you wait for your car, and if you can’t wait because of previous engagements, they make sure to have you covered with a ride or a loner. And to top it off, the staff is friendly and attentive! ",4.4
263,25-Sep-18,"staff very helpful, but missed opportunity to do smog when I purchased car 4 mos ago and thus needed to return to dealer for smog certificate so car could be registered with DMV. Was time consuming for me and for dealer. But the car was smogged and washed, so not all time was wasted!",4.4
340,15-Jun-18,"I woke up yesterday morning and opened up my email. There was a update notice from Autotrader of a new listing from Audi Pacific for Lexus LS460. I emailed them telling them I was interested, and then headed off to the gym. While at the gym I got a call from their salesman Alex Kang.  He told me he had taken that car in on a trade the night before, and it was almost flawless. I have been looking for an LS for over eight months, driving to New Port, Hollywood, etc. I got a lot of exaggeration, misrepresentation along the way.  Alex convinced me that if I was really wanting an LS, I should come see this car. So, I head to the bank, got a certified check, and got on the road. I arrived right at noon, and was meet by the sale’s manager Marin. Marin found Alex for me, and we went to see the car. Alex was right in his assessment. The car was like brand new. I looked at it for a few minutes, and told Alex I would take it.  We filled out some paper work, and I then met with Mike Choi the finance manager. Mike has a let’s cut to the chase attitude which I really appreciated. I was out of his office in no time, and driving home before 2:00. Overall, a great experience. Every where I turned someone was saying hello or asking me if I needed anything.  If your in the Market for a car give Alex a call. He knows the business and is very engaging.",4.4

505,10-Nov-17,"Regular maintenance visit and all of employees are professional and nice. I don't like that they suggest to repair or change parts even though still acceptable. When I point out that I have extended warranty and they didn't know that until I point out.  I thought you can automatically see what warranty i have. Maybe system is not good? 

Oh also I received the email with previous owners name on it. I transferred to myself 3 years ago....

248,14-Oct-18,"I had to go in to have a second run through on how to use my car. The first person I had worked with, not only gave me the wrong information...told me I had features I didn’t have...and didn’t show me how to use the features I DID have correctly. I was having SUCH a tough time and thought my car was defective and that I had bought a lemon. I went in and saw Natalie, who had made an appointment for me with Adam. Natalie couldn’t have been more helpful and lovely. As far as Adam goes...he spent SO much time with me, and REALLY cared and wanted me to KNOW about my car and it’s features and to know exactly how to use them. He was very informative and patient with me. He went above and beyond. Audi should have hundreds of Adams. If he would have been the first person to go over my car and it’s features with me, my initial experience would have been a dream. I was miserable for the first few weeks. I couldn’t even lock and unlock the driver side door and get my radio to work. Audi needs to do something about making sure all their employees are trained properly. It would make people’s buying experience MUCH more pleasurable. ",4.6
250,12-Oct-18,"Audi Pacific always takes care of me. My service advisor Anele gets the car into service promptly not just for the recommended service items needed , but for the things that I detail as important that have come up since the last service appointment. She makes sure that my concerns are checked by the technician.

Sergio was my technician and he completes a cool video review of the undercarriage and motor to demonstrate the issues to be repaired. Sergio actually shows me in the video the damage to old parts or leakage or wear so I can make an informed decision.

There is a new text system so questions can be answered more quickly with the service advisor.
I also really appreciate that at the conclusion of each service appointment, my car is cleaned and looks spotless. Even with major service, my car is ready the same day as dropped off.",4.6

622,09-Apr-12,"I initially worked with Edwin Arredondo and then Edwin introduced me to Chris Prodromides.  Both are good guys.  They both read my personality very well knowing I am ready to buy, have done my homework and am very familiar with financing and leasing options of a car.  Instead of giving me the ""black box"" this is your monthly payment treatment, they were very transparent from day one showing me all of their numbers.  I went home and ran these numbers against my leasing and finance model and everything came up similar.  Further, no matter how much I questioned or pushed, they both always had a GREAT attitude and never became arrogant, dismissive or made me feel like they had better things to do.  I truly feel like they are focused on the ""whole customer experience"" versus just the transaction of buying a car.  If this is how Audi service is, I may become a lifetime Audi customer.  This is my first Audi ever.  Before I have purchased BMWs (two), Infinities (3), etc.  never an Audi.  I am looking forward to my new purchase and the continued great customer service Pacific Audi provides.  The customer service makes a big difference",4.6

178,14-Jan-19,"I recently brought my Q7 for service.  Typically, I drop off the car and leave in a courtesy vehicle or a rental, but due to an error of my own, I was not able to get one.  Instead, the service advisor, Oscar, offered to complete the service within a couple hours, but instead of waiting around at the dealership, he would send me home in an Uber.  He also sent an Uber to my house to pick me up once the car was ready.  Audi Pacific really went out of its way to make the process convenient for me and I really appreciate that.  ",4.8
188,27-Dec-18,"From the moment you drive up until the time you leave after a service everyone is exemplary.
 They go out of their way to make you comfortable and accommodate your every wish (with in reason;) while you are there. They have even picked up my Audi for a warranty issue and delivered it on occasions when I am in a jam. It says a lot about a company when every one behaves in such a respectful, positive manner. Only sensational customer service!",4.8
190,21-Dec-18,Made appointment via website which was super easy and convenient. Visited the day of schedule and within 15ins out of dealer.

331,28-Jun-18,"I love my Q7. Unfortunately, in the 16 months that I've had it leased, I;ve had to bring it in for a variety of random repairs.  The latest was the long awaited ""fix"" on the brakes, which took over a year to get done.  I don't blame the service department. I blame AUDI.  I spoke with corporate and local AUDI folks at least 6 times before I was finally ""put on the list"" for the repair.  Essentially, they replaced my brakes
The service department people are really very nice, responsive and efficient. It is a shame that I had to be without my car so often in the last 16 months.",4.8

419,18-Feb-18,"We are reasonably satisfied with this experience.  Staff was courteous with quick check-in and check-out. Facility is comfortable and good coffee is always appreciated.

435,29-Jan-18,Everyone is very friendly upon dropping off my vehicle; usually are prompt to call if the're any problems or just to tell me the car is ready for pick-up. Professional set-up.

438,23-Jan-18,"Excellent customer service all around!  Was greeted promptly when dropping off and picking up the vehicle.  Broken visor clip was fixed with no charge, which I was hoping, since the part should not break when merely putting the visor back in a place.  Also discounted the front brakes service.  An added nice bit of customer service.  Knew going in that the brakes service was not an inexpensive one.  ",4.8

446,07-Jan-18,"Overall I was happy. Had difficulty connecting with a sales rep as I initially emailed Mark Johnson and didn’t get a reply, then emailed the general email and didn’t get a reply so I had to go through the chat bot to actually get someone to contact me. Not a good start for an existing return customer. Once I got in touch with a human Joe Adana was very helpful and Mark ensured I got the best deal possible. A couple small things: when you lease a $50k+ vehicle you would expect small acccessories to be included like roof rails and privacy cover for the cargo area. Not so. My previous Q5 that I leased in 2106 came with both and our q3 came with the privacy cover. Small thing but the expectation to sell those accessories on a $50k car is a bit disappointing. All that said, I am really pleased with the car and service. ",4.8

482,01-Dec-17,"The best part of the experience was Antoinette Garcia! She’s kind, patient, extremely helpful and totally professional.

Received a link to a 3 minute video that showed each of the inspection points and their current condition.  This was very informative and increased peace of mind.  The above, combined with a courtesy loaner vehicle and car wash, and excellent service from start to finish helps to justify premium service prices compared to say an independent service center. ",4.8
507,07-Nov-17,"Have been using Audi Pacific for service matter for years and have received excellent service from Michael Harris and the team.

During a routine service a few months ago, Natalie mentioned that the brakes for our wagon were coming due and that we should plan to have them serviced within the next 6 months (depending upon our driving of course). Taking that time to give us a simple ""heads up"" meant a lot and allowed for our family to plan ahead. Natalie is great, and considers our household and family as well as our vehicle!",4.8
557,20-Dec-16,This is the second time I have done business with Kevin and I will continue to work with him again and again. His attention to detail and what the client wants and needs are grade A. I used to feel uncomfortable prior to going into a dealership. Now I have confidence in knowing I got the best deal I could afford with the most honest sales person out there. I love Kevin and Audi Pacific. There is no better dealership and no better man to buy a car from than Kevin.,4.8
559,16-Dec-16,"My sales associate,Natalie Lucido has worked with me for the last several years.
She is professional, thorough , keeps me apprised of the status of the service for my A4 wagon.
She informs me of what the technician believes is needed for the service, the time needed, and an estimate of costs involved.
She always gives me a loaner, pending the need to keep my car overnight or longer, depending on the issues.
I appreciate working with her.
Obviously I have learned to trust her, and that means a great deal.

He called me back the next day and basically met my price for the car I requested.  Cesar did what he said and gave me what I wanted.  I was able to avoid the usual car salesman/dealership baloney and actually have a great experience.  The General Manager (Bernie) is a likeable ""hands on"" individual who helped greatly with my transaction as well.  Even the finance person was enjoyable and on point.

My car was detailed and waiting in the showroom for me with the paperwork ready for signature...Great Team = Great experience.",4.8
609,19-Sep-13,"Both Evan Bolton & Chris Prodromides were top-notch professionals, honest & straightforward (no nonsense), patient and expert at structuring the sale so everyone was a winner. I made a trade-in and received an excellent price, and purchased a used vehicle (2008 Chevy Avalanche) from them which was delivered spotless, clean & safety inspected looking like a NEW vehicle.

614,22-Mar-13,"Purchased a used Audi A4 Quattro from Rick. He was great to work with. Got me the car I wanted at a price that was just what i was looking for.

621,26-Apr-12,"Fred first contacted me after I had sent a internet inquiry over a month ago. He was very polite and friendly the entire time. Very professional and did what ever he could to make sure I was satisfied. Although I did not get the exact color I wanted, him and his sales team were able to workout a better deal on a brand new A4 with more options than I wanted at a much lower price than I had expected. Rosa finished up all the financing details and I could not have been more pleased with the service I recieved from them and the rest of the Pacific Audi team. I told Rosa that it was my very first brand new car and she threw in free window tint as congratulaions. I hope all my future car buying experiences will be as nice as this was.",4.8
626,17-Dec-11,"By far the best car buying experience I've had.  From the moment I walked in the door, the entire staff at Pacific Audi made me feel welcome and in control.  There was a courtesy and relaxed environment that I have not experienced at other dealers.  Sales Specialist Ryan was very thorough and did not apply too much pressure.  His friendly attitude and willingness to work around my schedule were like a breath of fresh air.  Thank you Ryan and Pacific Audi for making this car buying experience such a positive one.  After two previous purchases from other dealers that left me uncomfortable, this experience has restored my hope in customer-centered sales.  I have had the car now for almost  a year and still love it!",4.8
640,04-Feb-11,"Gino is the best sales person @ Pacific Audi.
He should be selling new cars.
His respect for the customer, the brand, and the cars is unsurpassed by any other sales staff there.
If the dealership had a repurchase program as an incentive for the clients to keep trading the vehicles there, that would be great.
I wish him great success. 
Thank you Gino!",4.8

His knowledge of cars impressed us the most and we relied on his expertise.  His friendly attitude and desire to help us find the best car to suit our needs made it a satisfying buying experience.",4.8
648,13-Jan-11,"I bought my first new car at Pacific Audi--a red with beige interior A3 TDI.  As it turns out a red A3 TDI with beige interior is hard to find.  After getting the run around from a number of other dealers in the Los Angeles area I happened upon Pacific Audi who took my color request seriously and ordered the car for me at a fair price.
I initially purchased the car from a salesman named David who at some point during the time my car was being made left Audi for Mercedes.  At that time Bernie, dealt with me.  At first it seemed my initial agreement for Christmas delivery with David would not be honored but after reminding Bernie about it I did indeed receive my car in time for Christmas.  It did not come with a big red bow as David had promised but I didn't speak up about it when I picked up my car and I'm pretty sure David didn't pass on that part of the deal to Bernie.
Shaun explained all the bells and whistles on my A3 and did a fine job doing so.  After he was finished I was able to easily use the navigation system to find the nearest Indian restaurant.
Because we were in the middle of an epic downpour in Los Angeles at the time I picked up my car, Bernie threw in a free detail for my new A3.  I can't wait to go back and redeem the offer and maybe I'll even get the big bow I was hoping for.
I would recommend Pacific Audi to friends and family and hope to go back for any service needs my new car my have.  I think Pacific Audi is a friendly business that treats their customers with respect and integrity.",4.8
653,11-Jan-11,"My husband and I bought our first joint car at Pacific and Fred was a pleasure to work with.  When we decided to sleep on the purchase, Fred remembered us as soon as we walked in the door and we felt like we got a great car for a great price.  The financing was easy and service was exceptional; the manager even came out to say hello.  Since purchasing, we have returned several times for service and all but once were able to get an Audi as a loaner.",4.8
654,10-Jan-11,"Jim is very professional. He definitely knows the car very well, plus he is hard working, efficient and straight forward.

657,10-Jan-11,"It was a great experience! Everyone was great, friendly and attentive! I would recommend Pacific Audi to my friends and family that are looking to purchase and new car.

662,10-Jan-11,"We were treated with respect without the usual pressure and gamesmanship that is often found at auto dealerships. We were open and honest about our interest in leasing and they responded in kind. Both Jim and Chris were easy to deal with, answering our questions and giving us good information about the various Audi models we were interested in leasing. We test drove a few different models, told them how we liked them and told them we were also considering the BMW. After some time we went home to think about what we wanted to do. A couple of days later we called back and told Jim what model we would like to lease. He located it in a color we liked so we came in and leased the A-4 Quattro. We love this car and feel good about the sales people.",4.8

When I decided to purchase the vehicle, Mark made the process simple and also seemed to have a great working relationship with other members of the Pacific Audi team.

Overall I was 100% satisfied.",5
31,18-Aug-19,"Very friendly, yet professional sales people and managers.  No high pressure sales tactics....they ask you if you want something, and if you don't, they move on without fanfare.  Despite buying a newly released vehicle, they were pretty knowledgeable about its operation and provided a good description on how to use it.  The finance guy was the same way.  No fanfare, very professional, and got to the point quickly.  I didn't see any evidence of savory sales tactics, mistruths, exaggerations, passing customers on to multiple personnel to wear you down, game playing, etc.  Just the type of professionalism that you would expect from a high end car dealership that is looking for repeat customers.  After 40 years of buying many cars, I would say it was the most seamless car buying experience I have every had.  No need to walk out the door without buying a car, as I have done many times.",5

The recall Letter came. My Q5 came in for repair and the “click click or tap tap” went away. I presume the noise I heard & felt at accelerator was what needed repairing. ",5

35,16-Aug-19,The service I received for a recall was excellent.  I especially liked the Service Video that was provided for my car as an update while the car was still in the process of being serviced.  Another great convenience was the availability of a Courtesy Vehicle as soon as Audi realized the servicing may take a little longer than expected due to another recall for a minor window matter that hadn't been completed previously.  ,5
36,14-Aug-19,"We came to Audi Pacific late in our Search, and I have to tell you that Marie stepped in and really got it close to the deal I wanted, and then the GM Marin, on a Saturday morning, gave me the what I was looking for, and we effortlessly closed the deal.

It started at the top with Marin, who was a complete gentleman and pleasure to deal with, and then Marie, Joby, and Dwight made it happen. I will for sure go back when it's time to get another Vehicle.

We were about to buy a Pre-owned Certified car, and wouldn't you know it, but there was a recall the next day after we signed all the paperwork.  The dealership crunched numbers and gave us a brand new car for a little more than what we were going to pay for a used car.  Joby was great to work with, didn't do the high-pressure sales (which I HATE), and called us when cars came in that fit our needs.  I loved the highly professional, but chill, atmosphere.

55,19-Jul-19,"Anel pleasantly greeted me and explained the 'curbed' wheel repair process, subsequently scheduled a service appointment for the following week.  I received multiple text reminders, as well as a kind note informing of loaner car availability.  Continuing the absolutely great customer service, Anel provided status updates and timely message of service completion.  The wheel damage, although probably small by most folks standards, was completed to my utmost satisfaction and surprise, as I'm very picky and expectations were not high.  I know where to look at the rim, and the repair is undetectable.  My two cents - buy the wheel and tire protection!
Anel again followed up with a note to verify my satisfaction with the overall job.  She's great, Five Stars across the board-",5

Mr. Joby Joy was able to find me a Q5 with all the options I wanted but the SUV was at the Riverside Audi dealership so it would take a little while to receive the SUV.  We finalized the deal and Mr. Joy offered to drop off the vehicle at my residence as the easiest way to transfer the vehicle to me.,5

From the time I called to make an appointment with a sales representative to taking delivery of the car everything went perfectly.  Their staff is the most professional I have ever dealt with.  I came in with a referral from the Costco Auto Purchase program and everything went exactly as I expected.  They honored the program guidelines completely and I feel I got an excellent deal without unnecessary hassle.  There was no pressure to sell me things I really didn't want.  Special thanks go out to Adam Roberts, my salesperson and Alan Toruno  - both spent a considerable amount of time with me to help me to understand all of the new technology available in the new Q5.  Alan programmed all of the initial settings for me and reviewed the car with me again when I took delivery.  He even made sure my garage door opener was correctly programmed - which took extra time since I have an older opener.  Adam and Alan helped to set up the Audi app on my smartphone and everything seems to be working great. Anthony Maldonado quickly found several accessories I wanted to add to the car and they have all been fitted to the car.   I really can't say enough about how well I was treated at Pacific Audi.  I will definitely be a repeat customer and recommend the dealership.",5

Henry, was very accommodating.  Waited for my car, while serviced. Nice atmosphere, during completion. Everyone, I came in contact with was courteous.",5
290,16-Aug-18,"Francisco is most professional.  I never had to call for info as he always texted me informing me what was happening and giving me estimates of time.  This is very much appreciated.  Although there were no cars for loaners I was promptly shuttled to enterprise where I was quickly and efficiently  taken care of by Joseph.  A gentleman, Michael, I believe, was most courteous on the phone. The unhinged sunroof (reason I was there) was always noisy even at time of purchase.  Salesman ignored this and actually told me he would have the car detailed and looked over  before I picked it up.  Not true.  Upon picking my car up I found a gas bill from Mexico in the glove compartment.

You have a very efficient service department. ",5
291,15-Aug-18,"I recently picked up a Certified Pre-owned 2015 Audi A3 TDI. Simon was the man!!! He made everything so easy and it totally took me an hour and a half to make the deal and out the door with a huge smile! They even put a hold on the vehicle for me for a week because I was away for a seminar. When I got back, I received a text message about the car ready for me to take home. I can't be any happier! It's actually our third car that we purchased from this dealership. No words to describe how great our experience was. Thank you!!!",5
292,15-Aug-18,"Contacted Adam at pacific Audi regarding arranging to travel 2 hours away to shop for a used car they had.

They had the car ready, clean and full of gas!!
Greatest service ever!! Thanks pacific Audi and Adam!!",5

Henry Esqueda got me checked in, the service done and then checked and out in record time. 
Everyone at every station was helpful efficient and friendly. 
I WAS BLOWN AWAY. 
This was my first time at Audi service - I have had BMW’s for the past 18 years and AUDI Pacific Service was far better than BMW. 
Thank you! ",5
296,13-Aug-18,"Easy to schedule, got me in quickly, Natalie was on the spot and anxious to make sure I was taken care of - good news/bad news, what I thought was an issue turned out to be nothing. So, a false alarm of sorts but no one made me feel bad & assured me that better safe than sorry was their approach.  Don't look forward to going in for service ever, but at least these guys make it so I don't dread it either.  ",5

So when I had an issue with my vehicle Alex quickly assessed my situation, made sure that the right service was recommended, and made sure that the correct person assisted me.

I would also like to give a big shout out to Marcelino.  His work is impeccable. Then I must say that your service crew is amazing.  They made sure that my baby was properly taken care of in a timely 
manner.

To be honest, the thought of buying a car is very overwhelming as I dread dealing with sales people and having to sit at the dealership for hours. My experience was nothing like I had imagined it would be. I let them know what car I wanted and they made it happen without a hassle. They were very accommodating, courteous and professional.

382,18-Apr-18,"My Audi was brought in for in-warranty service (35,000 mile).  I was given prompt attention and received a courtesy loaner Audi.  Later that day I received, via text and e-mail, a video from Thomas visually describing the condition of my car's important systems-a nice touch I had never seen before.  Anel Correa was very courteous and knowledgable, and kept me up-to-date on the service progress.
I would like to add one additional item:  If a courtesy car had not been available I was told that they would send me to Enterprise Rent-A-Car.  There is no way that I would ever do business with Enterprise.  The one time I did rent from them they tried to rip me off for damage to the car that I did not do.  After a week of haggling, I found out they had charged the prior 3 renters with the same scam for the same damage!  A Daily Breeze reporter did an expose on rental car scams and found a dozen instances like mine.  I asked him how many were Enterprise?  He replied ""All of them""!  (If you are interested, I have the full Daily Breeze report and subsequent follow-ups, which you may have a copy of.)",5

386,13-Apr-18,"I HAD A frightening experience with y 2018 Audi 5 quatro.  It stopped totally in the middle of the road, and then restarted.  Everything shut down.  When it restarted the yellow light indicated Stabilizer malfunction went on.  Long story short, when the yellow light was reprogrammed, it erased all of the info.  I still took the car to Audi on Hawthorne where I bought the car.  They kept it for a few days, gave me a loaner, and even road tested it to try to figure out what happened.  Couldn't find out why, but they tried very, very hard.  The Service person who helped me, Francisco, and the Head man who supervises all of the mechanics were kind and compassionate with me.  They could see how nervous I was and still am about something like that to happen.   I can only hope it doesn't happen again.  Everyone from the Customer service desk to everyone on the Service Floor area could not have been nicer.    Keep your fingers crossed it doesn't do that again.  I love driving this car.  I have had 3 other sports cars.  This is the BEST.  Jann Feldman",5
388,12-Apr-18,"In many decades of car buying/leasing, I have never worked with a team as knowledgeable, helpful or collaborative as Mark Johnson and Colin Kleinman. From the minute we entered the dealership and starting discussing our interest in getting more information about the Audi Q7, we felt like we were being helped... not sold. I've never had that experience with a car dealership. I'm in sale, I can smell the difference between selling and enthusiasm. Colin's knowledge of the Q line was exceptional. He continued to ask us questions throughout our time with him to better understand what kind of driving experience we were after. And when made our decision, Mark spent more time asking questions about our preferences in owning and leasing to make sure the package that they put together was the best for us. When you can purchase or lease the exact model and features you want, and walk away feeling like you got the best vehicle at the best terms possible, you write reviews like this. Especially after we had done our homework and knew what models and pricing were available elsewhere, and got the absolute best terms from Pacific Audi. Mark and Colin have earned their way into my ""trusted advisers"" column.  It's not easy entry into that group, but they made it a breeze. If you are looking for a car or an SUV, you would be foolish not to schedule some time with them.",5

I've been buying cars for over 50 years and experiences with the dealers  have ranged from unpleasant and / or stressful to enjoyable and satisfying.  Audi Pacific turned out to be the later with my first lease of a Q5  from them.  After 3 years of excellent experiences with a variety of service personnel (not to mention the Q5 itself), I just leased another Q5 from Audi Pacific.  Same experience - everybody involved in the sales experience made you feel like family and confident you were making a good choice – and never left you wondering if you just got ripped off.  Everyone was friendly, competent and helpful -  knew the cars and options inside out. Special kudos for my sales person, Collin Kleinman, and the general sales manager, Mark Thompson.",5

It's all the little things and more that keep me very content when I need my car serviced. It's for the most an in and out process and when it's not, they go out of their way to take me where I please, even the mall to kill time. I am very soiled. Not to mention my car is always up to par in service when I leave in my little Audi. Francisco Valenzuela goes above and beyond and deserves this review. Thank you Frankie for your excellent service.

Praise is in order for both salespeople I had the pleasure of working with--Simon Najarian and more with Michael Moye.  Both were very patient with all my questions in the decision-making process and Michael was especially patient solving my questions about the workings of the electronics of the car.  Friendly, efficient, thorough and patient are the adjectives to describe them.  They weren't satisfied until I was satisfied. ",5
565,15-Sep-16,"I don't even know where to start as there are so many great points about my experience. My rep was Dwight and from beginning to end he was knowledgeable, honest and patient. It didn't feel at all like he was trying to force me to buy something RIGHT NOW or giving me sales pitches. It felt like a reliable expert was informing me about a potential purchase I had little technical information about. I will return to this dealership always.

572,03-Aug-16,"I was referred by a friend to speak with Vitaliy Konovalov about leasing a new Audi. I drove from OC to Torrance to meet him & I definitely don't regret it. Vitaliy is so helpful, honest, and friendly and gave me the best advice on how to get a new Audi while still having another lease with VW. He was never pushy nor promised anything he could not fulfill. I had been to at least 7 other car dealerships that month and Vitaliy undoubtedly gave me the best deal ever on a brand new A3. I have never had such a pleasant experience at a car dealership and I would highly recommend this dealership and Vitaliy Konovalov. My sister was so impressed by the service & deals that she is switching to Audi Pacific as soon as her lease with Fletcher Jones Mercedes is up. Vitaliy and his team definitely made me a forever customer of Audi Pacific and I can't wait to be back in 3 years for my next Audi!",5

He is genuinely nice and  went way out of his way to insure that we were familiar with the various features of the Audi Q5 that we purchased.

They were obviously busy but treated me as though they were expecting me. Michael noted my concerns, had a loaner available quickly and followed up with thorough explanation of service suggested by mechanics. To my surprise they had noticed an issue which I had neglected to tell Michael about and proceeded to correct it after my ""ok"".

The dealership was closed but she answered the call, took down my information and had the car detailed and ready for a test drive the next morning. That afternoon I went home with a beautiful S5.

My service was completed in a timely manner and I returned for my freshly washed car. Mr Valenzuela also arranged for an estimate on a small body repair which he got for me in a matter of minutes.

I called a day ahead and Collin Kleinman said he would have the car clean and ready for me and then followed up to make sure I knew the directions.  Once there Collin had the utmost professional and friendly attitude and overall excitement to help me achieve what was I looking for.  With no pressure and lots of great answers for me...we found my car!  Fady Kilada in finance was just as warm and willing to make sure I understood all the details before signing.  These two were an absolute dream team to meet and do business with,  I would highly recommend this dealership and hope others get Collin and Fady to work with.  Thank you for my Audi and for making my whole experience of buying and dealing with a dealership and great one to speak of to others.  I love my new car! ",5

600,29-Apr-14,"I really just can't say enough great things about my experience with Audi Pacific.  And more specifically with Bernie, Byron and of course Dwight Oh.  Dwight is the main reason I did business with Audi Pacific and the reason I will continue to do business with them.  

I'm not local to Torrance and drove over an hour to visit the dealership.  I was just about to come off a lease with BMW and was looking for something different.  I thought of Audi as I love the German engineering and made my way to Audi Pacific to look at some CPOs with Dwight, whom I had made an appointment with.  From the moment I stepped in the gorgeous showroom and was greeted by Dwight's friendly smile and the smiles of the rest of the staff, I knew I was in good hands.

The great customer service extended through the test drive process and into sales talks.  Unfortunately, I wasn't able to do business the first time I made it down but through many long winded texts and calls (from me... yeah, I tend to have a lot to say about what I'm looking for and what kind of deal I need to make) at all hours of the day/night, Dwight was able to find the perfect CPO for me and invited me back down to test drive and make the deal.

After trekking down for a second time and again being greeted by friendly faces, I test drove the A4 that would eventually be mine, which Dwight had waiting right out in front of the store I might add, and was hooked.  It was indeed everything I was looking for and more!  And thanks to Dwight and his knowledge and willingness to help, we were able to make the deal.  Also big thanks to Bernie for helping with the finance part of it and also to Byron for helping finalize the finance deal.  What an awesome team to have worked with.

I left the Audi dealership that day with my new pride and joy and knowing that I had a new dealership and specifically a new car guy in Dwight.  Let me say that I am VERY loyal and when I am hooked on something, I will be loyal until something happens to change that, and it takes a lot to break my loyalty.  

So Audi Pacific and Dwight Oh... THANK YOU for an awesome experience!!!  I can't wait for my next Audi and I will be sure to refer anyone and everyone to you looking specifically for an Audi or even those that aren't sure what they want.

THANK YOU!!!",5
601,23-Apr-14,"I took my car back to Pacific Audi last week to complete the services I wanted done.  Michael Harris of the Service Dept took great care of me & my 2012 A6.  When I opted to get alternative tires to replace the worn Pirelli P-Zeroes, he was able to come up with the Michelin A/S ties I wanted, and at a great price.  Took care of my alignment as well, and even arranged for someone to grind the scuffs out of two of the rims.  Best of all, done in a day, and MIchael followed up with a timely phone call to give me a status update.   Definitely will go back again for my Audi's service needs.",5

The sale happened the first day I met him at the dealership. He also quickly shipped the car up north where we needed it. After the sale Evan has checked in a couple times to make sure we are pleased with the car and answer any questions we have developed through use of the car. All in all, if I were to buy another Audi it would definitely be through Evan. ",5

I recommend both Cesar and Nathan to anyone looking to experience superior customer service in the purchase of an Audi.  Thanks again guys!!! I will definitely be back!",5
606,03-Jan-14,Johanna is a great sales rep.  She was extremely helpful and knowledgeable.

Jake even helped me analyze and compare the other cars i was considering and made it easy for me to go with the Certified Preowned that Pac Audi had.  

I made my deal right on the spot, set up financing, and Jake helped me drop off the rental car i had as well as took me to the bank.  The other sales and service staff were exceptional and informative.  Even though it's over 100 miles from my home, I would definetely return to look for my next car.   I can't say enough how pleased i am with the first 6 months of my new ride!  Thank you AUDI.

I was not planing to by an Audi since I was so convinced to once again buy a BMW but I had the most pleasant experience with Fred Vand that I changed my mind and decided to go for an Audi. (Fred did not try to change my mind at all...I did it)
Very often sales people try to rip off women and do not even want to listen to their needs on a vehicle even though women can be very knowledgeable about cars.  
Fred is not pushy, he is calm and understanding.
I simply love that dealership and will strongly recommend the dealership and Fred Vand to anyone! ",5

619,01-Jun-12,"I came to Pacific Audi to check out the Q5. I was introduced to Jameil who was very friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable. After test-driving the vehicle with Jameil I was sure I wanted to make a purchase. Jameil introduced me to Nathan to discuss the options and prices. I decided to sleep on it. The next day was Jameil's day off, but he offered to come in if I decided to move forward with the transaction.

I called Nathan the next day to seal the deal. I love that I didn't have to haggle with him about the price, as I'd had to when I bought my last car from another dealer (Ford). I made an offer that was fair based on my research and he accepted.  I picked up my car the following day and Jameil showed me how to use all the features. 

I am very pleased with the car and with the service I received at Pacific Audi. At no point did I feel any pressure from anyone, all my questions were answered, and I appreciated their hospitality. I was preganant at the time, and they made sure I had snacks and water. Jameil also showed me the service area where I could bring the car for maintenance.  Pacific Audi is not the closest Audi dealer to my home,however, I will probably use their service department because of their outstanding customer service. If my next car is an Audi, I will definitely return to Pacific Audi. ",5

627,01-Dec-11,"We had a very pleasant experience at Pacific Audi in purchasing our S4.  My initial contact with Pacific Audi was Mr. Shipton.  We communicated via e-mail and set-up an appointment to discuss purchasing an S4.  Mr. Shipton through his e-mail was very helpful and friendly.  Upon our arrival at Pacific Audi, Mr. Shipton was busy, but Mr. Arredondo took over and assisted us in finding a car which best suited our needs.  He was able to find a model which fulfilled our needs and we decided on a very, very good price. Mr. Arredondo didn't push us to purchase a model that had more options than we wanted.  He presented a price that was agreeable to both parties and we purchased the car that day.  Pacific Audi had to search other dealers inventory to find the right car for us, so we are grateful for that.  The car was delivered the next day to Pacific Audi & after a few days of detailing, we were able to pick-up the car.

I was most appreciative of the way Pacific Audi didn't make it difficult in the pricing of the car.  Everyone was very friendly and made myself and Karie very at ease.  No pressure at all.  I don't think if Edwin didn't find this particular car, we probably would have purchased an S4 somewhere else.  

Thank you.",5
628,18-Nov-11,"Terrific experience at Pacific Audi with Jameil Janbolat.
I have owned several Audi cars, and have many experiences with different dealers.
I can honestly say Jameil is the best sales consultant I have ever met.
As an Audi owner himself, he is passionate towards AUDI and his customers.
I feel so comfortable chatting with him just like talking to my own friends.
When I decided to go to check out the car at the dealership on a Sunday when Jameil was not working. He left his friends and came to the dealership immediately to help me out. I didn't get the deal done on that day, he is still very friendly and does not push me at all. Comparing to the other Sales guys I have met before, Jameil is much better. There are so many sales people with experiences, but there are not many with the attitude and passion like Jameil.
I hope this will be helpful to some future Audi owners.
If someone would like to purchase or order an Audi, I would say this is the guy you should talk to. ",5

647,14-Jan-11,"Excellent communication. Staff knowledgeable and friendly.  No ""hustle.""  All very professional.  Was referred by my car broker Peter Arkin who is very knowledgeable and careful about to whom he would refer. My only problem is that I live too far away to be able to use Pacific Audi for my routine service. But I do plan to use them for major items if and when they arise.",5
649,13-Jan-11,"Ryan Shipton and the others at Pacific Audi all have expert knowledge of the Audi product and sales process.  They are all friendly and professional.  All questions were answered, emails and phone calls promptly returned with a reply.  

My purchase lasted nearly 5 months from the time I ordered the car until we completed the sale, as I ordered a specific model that was new and I went to Europe with my family to pick up the car (and drive it for an extended period of time) before it was shipped to California.  During this time I had many interactions with Ryan and his staff and have only positive things I can say about them.  

The nature of European Delivery has unique challenges and uncertainties, Ryan and his staff made all the arrangements and everything went very smoothly.

I look forward to purchasing another Audi next year from Ryan Shipton, and recommend him and the dealership to anyone wishing to purchase an Audi product.

650,11-Jan-11,"We live in Orange County and were set on making a deal with an Audi dealer nearby, however after speaking with Jim, it was clear that he was the only Audi dealer that was willing to help and work with us.  He was not pushy, was very honest and did his best to help us get the best deal/car.  He was very honest from the beginning and told us what he could and couldn't do, whereas other dealers I spoke to (that same day) were just the opposite.  Jim worked with us on the deal for over a week and we finally decided to make the deal with him.  Again, he was patient/honest with us and it was wonderful finally meeting him in person.  The transaction went smoothly and as expected, no hidden costs or surprises!  We love Jim and at Pacific Audi and would recommend him to anyone! ",5
651,11-Jan-11,"Thank you Audi, thank you Adam for all your help.
Every time i come for service, South Bay Audi is always very friendly and helpful not to mention the high quality products they offer. Outstanding job...
and oh thank you for the Audi loaner.

652,11-Jan-11,Jim was very helpful with the whole process. He was there to answer any questions that I had. He was very helpful by showing me numerous vehicles and their options. He was very thorough in going over the vehicle to me. It truly allowed me to really understand the options that came with my vehicle as well as how to use each one. I would definitely recommend this dealership as well as Mr. White to people looking to purchase the Audi brand. ,5
655,10-Jan-11,"We recently brought our Q7 from Pacific. I came all the way from San francisco. Pacific Audi Rocks in terms of customer service. I do recommend to my friends.I checked the car, paid money and got out.  thanks for making luxury car purchase so smooth.",5
656,10-Jan-11,"I have purchased and leased vehicles from Pacific Audi for the past 3 or so years. The main reason why I remain loyal is that they understand my time is valuable - they do not run me around in a typical car sales environment. I tell them what I can work with and they help me choose a vehicle that fits. Paperwork is quick, everyone is always friendly. They go out of their way to make things work. This also goes for the service department. Even though I have moved to the other side of LA, I will still remain loyal to Pacific Audi.",5
658,10-Jan-11,"I purchased an Audi TT from Kevin.  He was friendly and knowledgable over the phone, great to deal with in person and followed up on everything.  I had the Audi shipped to Canada and Kevin looked after everything from his end perfectly.  I was quite concerned buying a car over the Internet and actually decided to visit the dealership, however everything was as per our conversation.  I know where I will be calling Kevin for my next Audi.",5
659,10-Jan-11,"I was very pleased with my experience especially compared the treatment I received from a competitor. I would definitely do business with Pacific Audi again and I would ask for Cindy. The dealership worked with me to get the car I wanted at a competitive rate. At my request, they even eliminated an option that was suppose to come with the car that I did not want. The explanation of all the technology was very thorough and I'm happy with my vehicle. ",5
660,10-Jan-11,"Fred is great.  I would recomend anyone i know to work with him!  he is great, helpful and gave me a great deal.  Was  able to buy a car very quick as well.  The manager is also very nice.  Amazing car and it drives great.  So happy.  Came from a BMW and love my new AUDI",5
661,10-Jan-11,"This was my first new car lease and as a recent college graduate the Audi Financial Services College Graduate program is what landed me at this dealer.  As I walked on the lot I was greeted by Shaun and his coworkers and I found them to be extremely well qualified and friendly.  I was at ease working with Shaun as he never pressured me and provided me with the type of detail and professionalism that made me feel comfortable.  As the process progressed and I more seriously considered the car, Shaun's attention to detail and respectfulness is what made my decision for me.  It is clear that Shaun Hinson is a great young car salesman and I would recommend both him and Pacific Audi to anyone I could.  I have been pleased with my entire experience and would like to thank them for their attention to their customer.",5
664,10-Jan-11,"Pacific Audi is a great dealership.  My car buying experience was super simple.  Ryan, my sales rep, was amazing, easy to work with, and made the process stress-free.  I left the dealership feeling ecstatic and confident in my purchase.

I absolutely love my car (more than I ever even thought I would).  Ryan provided me with great information and recapped me on all the details associated with the car and its functions and features.

Not only was my purchasing experience great, but my service appointments have also been amazing.  The entire office (from sales, to service, to finance) is extremely helpful, friendly, and knowledgeable.

I would recommend Pacific Audi to anyone who is interested in purchasing a car.  I can attest that you will walk away completely satisfied.

I will be back in a couple of years (when my lease is over) to get another Audi! :-) 

Best,
Ashley",5
665,10-Jan-11,"The sales staff was friendly and courteous. They made sure I got a good deal on the car (on the account that I recommend them to friends and family which I do). They also made sure that I got great financing. They made experience easy and fun, cracking jokes here and there to ease up the tension.",5
666,10-Jan-11,This was by far the best car buying experience I have ever had. Jim and Chris were great to deal with. Negotiated everything over the phone and was in and out of the dealership with my new car in 1-1/2 hours. Can't recommend this dealership and particularly Jim and Chris enough!,5
667,10-Jan-11,Absolutely spectacular experience.  The price was by far the lowest I could find out of all Los Angeles dealerships.  Bernie and Ryan were able to pull the deal together very quickly while I was across the country.  No regrets... blows the other dealerships out of the water.  A+ work here!,5
668,10-Jan-11,"Best car dealership my wife and I have ever dealt with, both for sales and service. Chris and Jim ? (sorry, forgot Jim's surname) were a pleasure to deal with -- answered professionally and clearly ewvery question we had about the car. Once we decided to lease the car, Jim took the time to show me every feature -- and because I'm ""mechanically-challenged"" he had to review certain things more than once, which he did with a smile. The Leasing Person (forgot name, but a female) was equally pleasant, professional and efficient; she made the process smooth and fast. When I needed to service the car because of a blown tire, the Service end of the dealership was just as fine as the Sales/Leasing. The service manager told me when my car would be ready, and it was ready exactly as promised. The physical aspects of the dealership are wonderful, including the coffee! It is just a great place. My wife and I have been buying/leasing cars for over 20 years, both in NY as well as CA, and we have usually gone with Audi. Pacific Audi is the best Audi dealership we've experienced by far.So good, in fact, that we've leased Audies at Pacific for use at our home in Deer Valley Utah! Bravo for Pacific Audi.",5
670,10-Jan-11,"Leased a 2005 S4 from Nathan five years ago.  Called him up, he gave me an approx price, told him what I could pay and he found me a 2011 S4 that met all of my requirements.  Mailed me paperwork with a return FedEx envelope and it was that easy.  At pick up, the other Salesperson (I forgot his name) who I worked with on this transaction, gave me a detailed overview of the car's features and I was all done.  Look forward to purchasing the hybrid Q5 when it comes out later this year from Pacific Audi.",5
671,10-Jan-11,"Pacific Audi, and my sales rep, Ryan Shipton, provided me with one of the best car buying / leasing experiences I have ever had. The dealership was clean and professional and Ryan was as accommodating, informative, helpful and knowledgeable as any customer could possibly ask for.

I would highly recommend Pacific Audi and Ryan Shipton to anyone looking to buy or lease an Audi.",5
