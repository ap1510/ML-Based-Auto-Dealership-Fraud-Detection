0,"March 24, 2020","We recently purchased a Hyundai Palisade Limited from Patricia Esqueda at Frank Hyundai. She was very friendly and offered us a fair price on the hard to find SUV, below sticker pricing. She made the transaction very easy and didn't try to force a bunch of stuff on us we didn't want. She showed us the features of the car and helped us setup the account and car technology before we left. It was a pleasure working with her. We did find the back shade was not included, but Patricia quickly ordered one for us at no cost. 

We were at another dealership that same day who marked up the SUV $5K over sticker and forced added things like $1k sealant! We walked away from that dealer and luckily found Frank Hyundai. Thank you For a great experience!",5.0
1,"February 07, 2020","Purchased my 2020 Hyundai palisade in august of 2019. Upon walking into the car dealership, my husband and i were the only customers of color. No one came to help us or check what we needed for at least 30 min. Plenty reps were available but too busy helping those that came and didn’t look like us. I had an appointment but they didn’t come to work. I was assigned an internet rep who’d been there over 6 months and never sold a car, likely cause they assumed we wouldn’t purchase. Rep could barely tell me anything about my car or tell me important details about the veh I’d need after purchase like how to let my seats down or open gas tank or that my purchase included warranty/roadside..found that out on my own. They tried to force me to do in house financing with higher APR than my CU that i already told them i knew i was going with. After my purchase i found out i got a “protective coating” that was basically a scam and the next week i wanted it cancelled i never got it applied and it was over $700 in my loan! They refused to work with my schedule to apply it or remove the service from my contract and the service during the time was insulting from the agents there. I was lied to saying if you don’t want it we’ll refund you then they’d say they never said that. Fast forward to my first routine service, due to my complaints at purchase manager said my first routine service would be free. I called to schedule it only to find out that manager never put that in my contract and since i couldn’t remember his name i was told “that’s not our problem it’s not in your contact, we aren’t giving you anything free.” And hung up in my face. I was demeaned and outright disrespected by this company, and harassed by my sales rep for over 2 months saying i MUST fill out a 5 star review for him as part of my sale and that it’s required that i do it..i know that gets him extra pay so i did not as my experience was NOT even 1 star experience! 


I want a refund for the protective coating that we never received and i want my promised oil change. It makes me extremely uncomfortable as a service member who is barely home that if my wife has issues with her vehicle she can’t take it to the place of purchase for service because they yell at her, they demean her, they disrespect her, and they hang up in her face. A purchase so big should not seem like crabs in a bucket to this company and we do not feel like valued customers at all. We highly regret the purchase at the location and $700+ financed into a loan accruing interest on something we couldn’t even receive is absurd ",1.0
2,"October 24, 2018","Everyone was very friendly and helpful. Omar gave us time to check out the vehicle ourselves and was not pushy at all. He answered all of our questions and made us feel comfortable. Throught out the entire process, we never felt pressured once.

3,"October 24, 2018","I came to the dealership knowing what I wanted.  Mark met me as I approached the front door of the dealership.  He was incredibly informative and answered the remaining questions that I had, and offered me a test drive to so I could see how the car handled.

The exact specification of the car I wanted was not at the dealership, but Mark worked hard to search for what I wanted and found a vehicle that was as close as possible to what I wanted.

Mark was professional and upfront negotiating for the car, and he helped us to confirm rebates and manufacturer discounts.

Overall it was a very pleasant working with Mark and purchasing a new car.  We were in and out within a few hours.  I would highly recommend anyone considering purchasing a Hyundai to see Mark at Frank Hyundai.",5.0
4,"October 23, 2018","I like how the dealership automatically schedules appointments but it is not conducive for me since I live in North County and I travel for work. I would prefer if they just sent a link via text or email with the available slots. Also there are too many phone calls. Depending on the consumers age, we prefer text or emails so we can easily organize our schedule appointment. If someone calls me I have no idea what my schedule is in two weeks and its a waste for everyone's time. 

Now for the review of the service. The service rep asked me if I wanted a car wash. I said yes, when I got to the car, it was not washed. 

The wait time for a oil change was a little long even with an appointment. I sat outside and worked on my computer but I had no clue when my car was done. I walked in 2.5 hours after I dropped car off and they informed me the car was done 45 minutes ago. A Text message would have been useful :)

All employees at this dealership are all super friendly and helpful. Its easy to approach an employee and have a conversation with.",3.4
5,"October 22, 2018","I purchased an Accent Hyundai 2015 on September and I was owed 3 things, tinted window, cover seats, and wheel locks. Its been a while now, and no one has contacted me to make an appointment. In addition, the car makes a noise when it goes up a hill, this started a few weeks in but I thought it would go away but it just got worst. Lastly, I got stopped by a cop because my third backlight was out, I explained to the officer that I had just bought the car a month ago and he let me go without a ticket, once I went to a mechanic to get the light change, the light was fried, black, this was not a month accident. I am really disappointed with the car, the associate was nice to explain everything, but her nice service doesn't match the dissatisfaction that the car has given me.  I will not recommend this dealership and I will never buy here again. ",3.0

22,"October 16, 2018","Very courteous and professional. I would however like to give my recognition to Nick. He was actually the sales person that actually showed me the cars on the lot that I was interested in and took the test driving with us and was very informative and friendly and made me feel at ease. Unfortunately, when I went in to make the purchase the next day, he was out. 

All in all, I would recommend Frank Hyundai to my acquaintances.

26,"October 16, 2018","Angel contacted me last Friday after my car was in for service due to an issue that was still being disputed with Hyundai regarding a warranty extension I was never notified about  for my steering wheel.  By Friday evening he called back to say he had the approval from Hyundai to do the repairs under warranty and to bring the car in Saturday morning.  I really appreciate him going above and beyond when the issue I had was not with Frank Hyundai but with Hyundai itself. I was not notified of 3 recalls or the warranty extension. The moment I contacted the dealer to schedule the apt they were very helpful!  Thank you for the great customer service! 

The only downside was whoever did the repairs left my drivers seat dirty and I had to wait while Angel made sure it was taken care of! ",4.8

32,"October 12, 2018","I went in to look at car since i will be getting one soon and Christian, the dealer, showed me the cars. I told him from the beggining that I was on a time limit and would not be geeting anything ans he basically lied to me saying I would be leaving the dealiership by 1pm. I was so rushed through the paper work that I didnt pay attention to the paper and didnt leave until around 2:30pm, making my husband late for work and getting suspended as a result. When we got home, I was looking through the papers and I noticed they gave me the wrong car. I clearly told him I wanted a blue hyundai Kona 2019 and the sold me a 2018 and it made me mad. I came back the next day and they call christian, the dealer, and I told him he has messed up and that I wanted the Kona 2019 or another car since I was not thinking on paying the amount he told me for a car that is a year older when the 2019 is the same price. He made faces, called me a liar and has very disrestpectful to the point I had to leave the facility. I called hyundai and told the situation to someone else (apparantly the manager or someone in charge) and they ended up cancelling the purchase but not before leaving me without a car for a day and a half. On top of that, during the long hours spent at the dealership, we were never offered any water or coffe. I had my 4 year-old with me for the whole time and we asked the dealer (christian) and didnt even bother to give my child some water when she had been there for about 3 hours. Also, the a guy from finaxes, his last name is cerda, was rude to me and also pushed me into getting the car the same day even though I had no time. Horrible service. ",1.2
33,"October 12, 2018","Service received was excellent, I was service as scheduled, timing was excellent. If asked I would recommend this dealership for good service.  
Chris is the person that I contact or he will contact me when routine service is needed for my car.",5.0
34,"October 11, 2018","We went to Frank Hyundai to see if we could get more car for the buck than at a Honda or Toyota dealer. Boy, could we ever! We walked in pricing a mid-level Sonata, and left with a top-of-the-line Azera. From the first contact online through the due-bill post-sale upgrades, the Frank Hyundai experience has been phenomenal. This is our...10th car?...and this experience was by far the smoothest. Thank you, Team Frank!",5.0
35,"October 11, 2018","We had a great experience purchasing our new vehicle at Frank Hyundai.  Our salesperson, Livio, was wonderful.  He went above and beyond what a salesperson typically does in answering our questions and making sure we were well taken care of.  He was very personable and knowledgeable and a true asset to the Frank Hyundai dealership.",5.0

Also can offer transport to shopping center, if it takes longer than that. The communication about service and repairing is very good. You get everything explained. So very reliable service center.",4.4
40,"October 08, 2018",This is our 2nd car purchase with Hyundai and I can honestly say this is the place to buy a car. We went to many dealerships and always felt pushed to buy something we couldn’t afford. Everyone at Hyuandai was so helpful and actually listened to what we wanted and can afford. The process went very smoothly and we were well informed of everything. They were willing to work with us and went above and beyond to get us in our dream family car. Our family will definitely be going back to Hyundai for our next car. ,5.0
41,"October 07, 2018","I had done a lot of research, knew I wanted a Hyundai, but wasn't clear if I wanted an Elantra or Tucson.  When I decided on the Tucson I wasn't sure which model. The sales person was patient, although every time I showed some positive interest in a car he asked if I wanted a test drive. Because one of the cars I had chosen on True Car was not to be found on the lot, I settled on the next level up, the Tucson Sport. After some back and forth on the price, I pulled out my Costco card and ended up with a great deal. Christian was very sweet and actually returned my rental car for me. The young woman, who was the financial wiz, was wonderful and managed to lower my loan rate. So, after a couple hours tops I left with a car I really love. I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 only because there was a lot of negotiating going on, which I didn't mind so much, but someone else might not.  Or wouldn't be as willing to haggle.",4.4
42,"October 07, 2018","I’ve been coming here for years. This day, I felt like an outsider and out of place. My service rep was ok, but not friendly.
The young lady at check out seemed mad and had an attitude.
I may go to another HYUNDAI dealer for servicing.",2.6

I trust your company than I haven`t check the documents and signed it?it happen nothing can change?but I need to let your staff know must honest? I have many friends immigrated to USA and  looking for vehicles? I try to recommend to your company? but now no more?,1.4

45,"October 06, 2018",I’ve given Frank Hyundai the highest rating possible because I had a excellent experience. The sales rep was very pleasant and very knowledgeable about the vehicle I planned to purchase. They were very flexible when negotiating a sales price and I had a great experience. ,5.0
46,"October 05, 2018","Knowing you have to take your car in for an issue other than service and without the warranty is a terrible feeling. Its cumulative of those without health insurance and going to Dr. Not knowing how much everything will add up to be causes a ton of stress. Jose made this process as painful as possible. He was first very honest which instilled trust in the findings after the diagnostics. He listened to every concern and did not make me feel like those concerns were foolish. As a customer that wants her car to be preserved as best possible, I feel like I might at times have unnecessary concerns. Jose patiently listens and even though he has a ton of appointments that are all for him and has a lot of calls coming through, he takes his time per customer. While I was there, a new customer came in asking for help to find keys to a car she purchased. The other lady there slightly dismissed her request for help and sent her to the cashier to get help. Jose addressed the lady, called people to see and since he was helping me he let the girl know he would be with her momentarily to help when he didn't have to. That raises your level of quality not only for the service department but for the experience your customers receive as Frank Hyundai as a whole dealership. For this reason I will remain loyal to take my car to the dealership versus an outside mechanic due to this level of individual quality customer care service. As management myself, it is truly my mission to ensure my staff are valued and recognized through all measures possible and I am hopeful this is happening here and towards your key team member Jose Guerrero. Lastly, Dolores was absolutely wonderful and very helpful and professional over the phone and in person. My car stayed overnight and so I had a couple of opportunities to speak with her and check out with her. She ensured I was called back, and listened to my venting (not about customer service) when I picked up my car. She is also a part of your key team members!

Thank you,

65,"September 27, 2018","I bought my Santa Fe from Frank Hyundai in 2008; I loved it and I drove it for 10 years, but it was time to upgrade. I had not had a car payment though for many years, and being a single-parent income household required I buy something dependable but affordable. I decided it was time to visit Frank Hyundai to see if they had a newer 'used' car that fit my needs. I had a wish list of items and thought I'd have to buy used to get something that was in my price range, but I am absolutely AMAZED and EXCITED to say I drove home with a car I am 100% 😍😍 in love with. I never thought I would be able to afford a car I wanted and truly loved in every way, but I got my wish of items and more, so much more. I didn't have to compromise to get something that I could afford!! They did an amazing job with my financing; I'm very happy with the new car percentage rate they offered me. They found me a new car rebate, and they gave me a more-than-fair trade-in on my Santa Fe. Thank you to Willy R, Chris W, Andy M and Manny L for doing everything possible, and more, to get me a car I feel very happy driving in ",5.0

67,"September 27, 2018","There always seems to be additional services that you recommend. I just thought I needed an oil change. The tire rotation was another $20.+ . Then, my tire warning light was still on as I drove away. I returned to the service bay instead of out of the parking lot, and your service people said it would go off. Some miles down the road, it did. Later, I received a call to make sure that it did go off. Thanks. I appreciated that. Finally, no free car wash, which is about a $12. cost to me. That would have eased the pain of the total charges, but I didn't even get a wash (you said it was broken). 
     By the way, the seat belt still gets caught in the door, often. That caused a dent on the side of the door, which your guys said I would need to get fixed at a body shop (i reported this previously). Seriously? I scotch taped a piece of paper to raise the dented spot. Now the door will lock again. 
Fix your seat belt issues, I would recommend.

After that I was sold ! Went right in and did the paperwork with ease! He was professional and personable it was great working with him to find a car.

82,"September 20, 2018","Short story: I was left without a vehicle for 7 hrs and all they did was add 2 psi of air to one of my tires. Didn't even get my car washed like they promised.
Long story: I took in my car to have the alignment check because my vehicle would steer to the right. I walked in with my appointment being at 9am. The representative told me it would take about two hrs to diagnose and they would get back to me to see if any work needed to be done.. I got their shuttle service back home and went about my day. Come 1pm and I was yet to receive a call from the service center so I decided to call. They told me the technician in charge would get back to me. 30 minutes later I received a call from the technician and he tells me that they couldn't find anything wrong with the car and they just added air to the tire( which was at 34psi and they added to 36psi). I asked if I could get the shuttle service back and they told me I would have to wait till 3:30pm. I got to the dealership at 4:25pm. And they didn't even wash my car like they promised..
I can't believe that they would take so long to get back to me after just adding air to my tire.. Their accuse was that they had to have two technicians dive it to get two different opinions.. ",1.6

84,"September 17, 2018","From the getgo  things did not start well at Frank Hyundai, but I was giving the dealership the benefit of doubt since it was early that morning. I had a appt with Ruby and was told that she would be in the office in about 2 minutes the day I arrived. She never showed up nor did I receive a phone call saying that she was off that day. Anyhow, her assistant Louis took over and showed us the available inventory. We wanted to test drive the 2018 Elentra and they could not find the keys to the car we wanted so we tested another car. After some negotiations we agreed on the terms on a 2018 Elantra color white. The process lasted 4 hours and afterwards we sped off with our new car. While on the freeway I received a call that they forgot to place the registration sticker on the window. I drove back and Louis placed the sticker. The next day I received a call from Alex the sales manager requesting that I text him the VIN on my new car. Turns out that the paperwork we signed had the wrong VIN number and not the one on my new car. This is a quality control issue that was overlooked and in my opinion should not happen because this type of transaction is what they do on a daily basis. At first they wanted me to drive to National City from Oceanside and finally they contacted me and made arrangements to have the paperwork resigned at my home. Overall, I give their customer service a very low score. I am happy with my new car, but I will most likely not return to purchase another vehicle at Frank Hyundai nor recommend that dealer to my friends, family or colleagues.  ",3.0

147,"September 01, 2018","I have had the worst experience. You expect your car to be repaired when you get serviced and not be taken advantage of. 

On 4/16/18, I scheduled an appt. as I had service issues with my Hyundai Tucson; one being the transmission and the other a leak in the front left tire. I left my car there for the entire afternoon and instead of being repaired, they said they couldn’t replicate the issue and that my tire had a nail in it that was not repairable. I asked them to show me nail but they couldn’t. I was mad and disappointed that I wasted my time, I swore I would never go back there. 

So my tire did not have a nail in it and I discovered that it is just a leaky stem and that needs to be replaced. Also my transmission was still acting up and not accelerating properly when I drive uphills and into the freeway which is scary. So since I’m on warranty, I decided to go back to the dealership to see if they could detect it this time. What a bad decision this was. 

On 8/30/18, I took my car in at 1:45pm. I explained the transmission issue again and the service advisor, Chris said that I would have to leave my car over night to be looked at. He also said I was due for a 30k mile inspection which I initially refused because it was expensive and my purpose was to fix the transmission. I was upset because the length of time without a car and then realized I still had to repair my tire stem. I went back to Chris and asked if he could repair and replace the leaky stem, I would also do the 30k mike inspection.  Chris said that he could repair and replace the stem, so I agreed to also do the inspection. I was satisfied hoping all repairs on my car were to be resolved. 

I pick my car the next day to find that again, the service dept. could not replicate the transmission issue. Also even though they did find find a leak in the stem, it did not need to be replaced but screwed tighter. However, they said they repaired the leak without having to replace the stem. The did do the 30k inspection which i really didn’t need or want and I was charged for that. I left very upset like I was just scammed. 

To top it off, the tire is still leaking air and it is now the left rear tire as they rotated the tire in the inspection. Not sure how safe that is. I was scammed again thinking they were going to repair my issues with my Hyundai Tucson. I feel like I should report to the better business bureau as my tire is still leaking after they state it being repaired. Hopefully my transmission issue miraculously disappeared with the oil change.  

Do not trust this dealership.  They only care about money and their attention to detail and high level of customer satisfaction is something they don’t care about.  ",1.0

I told the salesman about being pre-approved from my bank and he didn't offer the option contract and I felt obligated to get financed by them. One finance guy tbrougj email said we could go through the bank but when we got to the dealership the lady said that we couldn't because we didn't have a check right then and there. There was a charge on there for $900 that was for the TINT apparently. We knew nothing about that charge being for the tint when we bought the car. The car had no floor mats in the front or back and the car has keyless entry and when we left the salesman said the number for the keyless entry was in the manual and it was not. He said he'd take care of us and he didn't. Didn't hear from him again. Now they're telling me we have to take it to Ford and pay $125 to get the number reset.

200,"August 10, 2018","When setting up my appointment I specifically asked about the work that needed to be done to replace the door guards. 3 of the 4 fell off pretty quickly. I didn't want to take off work to come in but the door guards could only be done during the week. I asked about a shuttle and was told they have one but it didn't go to my house. I found a library I could work at 1.1 miles down the street. After checking in at 9am, I was told the shuttle would be there at 9:30. At 9:45 the shuttle driver arrives stating the shuttle going South was ready. I asked about going North and was told that shuttle wasn't until 10:30. After a conversation with the staff they apologized for the misunderstanding and arranged to have someone drive me to the library, 1.1 miles up the street. I was told the appointment would be approximately 2.5 hours. An hour and 20 minutes later I received a call saying my car was done. I was then told the door guards that I specifically had to come in during the week to get fixed were out of stock and wouldn't be in for 2-3 weeks. Fine. I asked if someone could come to get me and was told the next shuttle wasn't for another 1 hour and 10 minutes. It's 90 degrees outside and I'm not young! I agreed to walk back so as not to inconvenience the dealership. It took me 25 minutes to walk back in 90 degree weather. When I get there I requested a change to my bill and took a seat. 25 minutes later I ask why it's taking so long to fix my bill and am told the bill is ready but the car isn't. What? It's been nearly an hour since I was called and told my car was ready. By this time I could have waited for the shuttle and not walked for 25 minutes in 90 degree weather to pick up a car that wasn't ready! The staff became very defensive and my unhappiness is a problem although I never raised my voice or used any foul language. I did waste a lot of my day on a dealership that should not have scheduled work that couldn't be done and told me my car was ready an hour and a half before it was actually ready.

222,"July 30, 2018","I would like to bring to your attention my first oil change experience with the service department at Frank Hyundai. The service department was very helpful and understanding of my need to bring my own full synthetic oil to the service department and scheduled an appointment for an oil change to my 2017 Sonata on Saturday July 14th, 2018 at 3pm. 

Now the issue of much concern, on Saturday July 14th I arrived around 2:20pm for my scheduled 3pm oil change service appointment. During the paperwork for the oil change, instructions were noted on the form that the customer was providing both the full synthetic Royal Purple 5W/20 oil and an original Hyundai oil filter. After some back and forth interactions with several customer representatives, I agreed to pay for the oil change labor a total of $19.98. After about an hour and a half, I was told that the oil change had been performed, the car was washed and I was ready to go. However, upon receiving the car and before starting it, I checked to make sure that my purple oil was used instead of the regular Hyundai motor oil used by the dealer. To my surprise, the oil was dark brown in appearance and not light purple like it was supposed to be. I expressed my concern to the service departments representative and he proceeded to investigate on the matter. The representative asked the technician Pedro Chavez for the Royal Purple empty 5 quarts oil jug to verify the color of the oil. It took some time to get the Royal Purple container but eventually the representative got it and it still had about 1.25 quarts of new oil remaining inside the container. When I explained to the representative that my car has an oil capacity of about 5.07 quarts of oil both of us were concerned about the 1.25 unused new Royal Purple oil. Jose brought the issue to the Service Manager, David Constant who came out and acted defensively trying to make excuses for the oil to be dirty since according to him it was normal for oil to appear dirty brown due to the engine running from the service area to the wash area and then to the delivery area. I explained that I had been using this particular oil for many years and that this was not the case and presented the leftover oil in the Royal Purple container. The Service Manager looked very upset and argued with me that he had no place to put my Royal Purple oil and apparently went to his office to check the oil capacity of my 2017 Sonata SE with 2.4 liter engine. To my surprise, the service manager was not even professional enough to verify that in fact there should have been no left over Royal Purple oil had it been poured completely in my car and that he had no idea of what the technician had done. The representative went to speak to the technician again and was told that apparently(I don’t buy the story) he started pouring Hyundai oil first, and then realized that he had to use Royal Purple so he filled the rest of the oil capacity with my Royal Purple oil. 

I will never know for sure what the technician was thinking but as a result from this investigation I can guess that either the technician failed to read the service order instructions, decided to steal the customer’s oil or once he realized that he forgot to use the customer’s oil he chose not to drain the regular Hyundai oil and start over with the customer provided oil. In either case the technician tried to cover his unprofessional actions by not telling the customer or his Manager. This is both concerning, unacceptable and could be considered fraud. Equally concerning is the fact that the Service Manager who did not seem to try to remedy the situation from the beginning failed to come and apologize for the technicians unprofessional actions and for his incorrect assumptions on the appearance in color of the oil. I strongly feel that it is the Service Manager’s duty to investigate on a complaint, find the issue as well as an acceptable resolution and apologize to the customer in person. Instead, he delegated to the representative to deal with the investigation and resolution by scheduling a second oil change for July 18thy at 7:30am where the oil(Royal Purple 5W-20 5-quarts) and Hyundai oil filter would be provided by the Frank Hyundai’s service department at no cost.

Given these events, how can I trust the Frank Hyundai Service Department to continue to service my vehicle when the Service Manager is not closely paying attention to the technicians work and once an issue is found he does not act professionally regarding same. By the way, the main Hyundai Director Mr. Griffin was copied on this e-mail and as of now, he too was not even professional to reply to the e-mail. Terrible upper management customer service.

All in between lies, shady actions, rudeness, poor service and quality. It made me regret not going to Kearny Mesa, the closes Hyundai dealer, since I live in PB.
Lets start!

Would you buy a car from a dealership that let you bring your car home without really having the bank getting your loan?
They did, and asked me to comeback days later because they would have ""a better deal"" for me.
The better deal: Higher interest but the car would have a discount. Thats what Alex Cerda said.
You should see the body language of this employee, he should work at autozone.

Would you buy a car from a dealership that take off the loan the extended warranty, gap and insurance plan you purchased without telling you and having an employee lying to you saying the loan is lower now because he gave you a discount on the car price, so the bank could finance for you?? Would you?

Alex Cerda told me he was giving me a discount on the car price, but ""FORGOT"" tell that he took off more than $3500 in extra stuff I've purchased, letting me believe that everything would be on the new contract.
When I found out, I told the salesman I wouldn't sign the new contract, he was surprised because he knew they took everything out and he believe the guy told me, but he didnt, he called it a DISCOUNT.

Would you buy from this dealership?
The sales man Tim Brown left the room to talk to Cerda, who came back exalted asking on a rude way ""WHAT IS THE PROBLEM?"". Great customer service...
I told Alex that he was shady when he said he was giving a discount without mention he took off all the extra stuff, so he got pissed off, and on a aggressive way he said: ""YOU HAVE TWO OPTIONS, OR YOU SIGN THE CONTRACT, OR YOU GIVE ME BACK THE CAR!""...... seriously????????????? I tried to talk to him to show him that his sales techniques were being shady and not clear, but he was pissed because I figured out, so he started interrupting me again asking loud: ""IS THE CAR HERE? GIVE ME BACK THE CAR, GIVE ME THE KEYS, I CAN SELL THIS CAR FOR A HIGHER PRICE ON THE MARKET... GIVE ME THE KEYS"" but he figured out I wouldn't let him go forward with that and left the room without letting me talk.

Tim Brown, the sales man was chocked, he had no reaction... his mouth was open like :0 WHAT A xxxx IS GOING ON? Tim Brown and Mark Moore are the only professional people I deal at this dealer. Not even the Administration Manager is professional.

After all this stress, they put back the gap, so I signed the contract only because it was still a good deal for me, but I shouldn't because of the rudeness, but I needed this car because of my constant trips to Phoenix twice a week.

Got home and sent an email to the president of Frank Motors, who forwarded the email to the administration manager, who called me basically to protect his employee Alex Cerda, saying that he didnt meant to be rude. He also complained because I wrote a review on Dealer Rater.

Anyway, after a week with the car at my office covered I decided to move on and start to drive it, because all the situation there was so bad, that I didnt want to use that car.
They still should put the leather seats on, so I was praying for them to dont stress me again. I have partnership on 3 business in Brazil that I have to do the administration living here. A new business in Arizona and another small startup in San Diego, so things like that are not helping me at all.

The sales man told I could put the leather in one year if I want, but Tracy called me saying that I should bring the car next week, kind of enforcing me, so I did.
Do you think everything went well?? xxxx no! The company who put the leather is not Hyundai, so the seats wont look like original Hyundai seats and unbelievably the company delivered the car at Frank Hyunday with a lot of imperfections and A HOLE ON THE BACK SEAT! 

Would you buy from a dealership that deliver a car without checking it?After all, would you support a customer service like that? Drive to Penske or Kearny Mesa. I went to North County Hyundai and they are SUPER!",1.6

I understand money has to be made, but there’s way to ask for someone’s money and not make it seem like the whole deal is about you, and not the customer. I started the process with someone who knew little to nothing about the cars he was “selling”, then after starting the paperwork (that old back and forth dance for payments and downs) I was approached by a very assertive gentleman who made it seem like what I was asking for was not going to happen, then magically comes $15 dollars shy of it. And the only reason I agreed to it was because, my argument for trying to be under where I was at was because I knew I had to talk to finance after and the payment would go up another $30-$50 dollars. But he said and I quote “I’ll talk to them...” not only did he not talk to finance, he was nowhere to be found. After the deal was done, I was given my keys and then left alone. I was not told one xxxx thing about the features of my car other than the little chatter during the test drive(I figured everything out on my own for the next days after). I also said I wanted the car in white but was told flat out that there wasn’t one (like there wasn’t another one on earth that could’ve been delivered). all in all the only reason why I’m giving 3 stars is because I do like my car, and the Car Service section from this location does good work.

I was pleasantly surprised by how smoothly the negotiation went, and that the dealership required him to do a technology orientation like that usually associated with luxury brands. The dealership itself is quite obviously dated. It needs a total renovation, and better signage for customer parking. Your instinct when you pull in is to go left which leads you to a dead end occupied by new inventory. Works as a sales tactic I suppose, but it’s hazardous and confusing. ",5.0

328,"June 04, 2018","I just want to talk about my experience with Frank Hyundai. Let me start by saying this is the 4th car I have purchased from them and there's a reason from that. This time I decided to go through the Costco Auto Buying Program because I wanted to ensure I was getting the best deal possible. I had done research on what I wanted, had a firm idea of what I was looking for and went from there. From the start I walked in to the dealership and was greeted by the Costco Auto Buying Rep that was recommended through that program. I had been contacted before hand to setup an appointment, and I did a few test drives. I got into the dealership a little late in the evening, but the staff was friendly and didn't put any pressure on me. Since it was so late I was advised to come back earlier in the day to see about a better deal. I did just that the next day, and a better offer was available. I signed papers and was good to go. A few days later I was given a call because my payment went down a good amount and I needed to sign a new contract again. I happily came in as this felt reminiscent of one of my past purchases, signed new papers and went on my way. I was given a follow-up call to congratulate me on the car and see if I had any questions they could answer. So from that you can see how much care and concern was shown through the purchasing process. You would think this would be the end of the story right? Well no. This is not the end. I got one last call a few days ago that they had found a better deal, my monthly payments were going down once again, and this time my interest rate went down as well. I can't tell you how much I appreciate the entire team at Frank Hyundai for their hard work, genuine concern, and overall care with this purchase. As someone who needs her car to get to work, school, and caring for my disabled mom I am absolutely appreciative of all they have done. I feel like reviews often magnify the bad, and silence the good. I am hoping that this review highlights the good, and the reasons I keep coming back. Continued business earned, and a great big hug of thanks to the team at Frank Hyundai!",5.0
329,"June 03, 2018",I purchased my first new car at Frank Hyundai. The salesman Jorge hasn't been there very long (a few months I believe) however he did a great job of working with me and getting me into a brand new 2018 Elantra at a reasonable price. I would definitely recommend anyone to Frank Hyundai of National City looking to purchase a car. Ask for Jorge!!!!,4.8

333,"June 02, 2018","In the course of having my tires rotated and inspected the service technician ignored or did not see three  nail that were in my tires. Also the technician rated my tires in good condition 6/32” when my tires were at best well worn 4/32”  This leads me to believe or at least question if the tire rotation and inspection we’re done at all.  When I inquired about the discrepancy with service writer, the service writer was more interested in explaining away the discrepancy in a manner which  attempted to blame me for lack of understanding of the situation/problem. 
This is  not the first time I have had issues with this particular service writer and the service department. 
 Upper management was willing and understanding of the problem and worked to resolve the issue. Though Management needs to Remove this service writer from customer contact before they find themselves in a legal sitsuation or god forbid the service writers inabilities gets someone killed.

347,"May 29, 2018","I'm not sure what I really scared of going into a dealership, oh yea, the fact that going into a dealership is probably the most anxiety any human can go through.  Luis was my rep for the vehicle, look as long as you treat me like a person and not a number you have me sold and I would walk out of there with two cars if I could.  Luis was super cool dude who understood that buying a car isn't as easy as figuring out what to wear.  From test drive to fiance, I would have to say this was by far the best experience I have had since driving.  This place has earned my business and hopefully some of my friends who are in the market for a new car as well.  I would for sure be back when I'm in the market for a new car but for now I'm enjoying my 2018 Elantra Sport that honestly I got a super amazing deal on and they worked with me with my credit and down payment.  So for all those looking, go to Frank Hyundai and ask for Luis.  Sorry, I'm kinda bias in who helped me, so go to Luis, tel him I sent you, trust me there is only one Toguri he knows of and buy a new car from him.    ",5.0

He wrote down my complaint and all my information, said he'd forward the information to the right person.  He asked me not to fill out the survey until I heard back from them.

Your Finance Manager was also friendly and professional.  He worked with me to get the monthly payments and the warranties I wanted and could afford.    Yesterday I had to bring the car in to be sealed.  Your service staff and cashier were all pleasant and professional.  They all made it so easy to drop the car off and get the loaner car.

448,"September 22, 2017","I contacted Omar over the internet to get some idea of pricing before I went in to the dealer to test drive the Veloster we eventually purchased. He was extremely responsive via email, worked with me on pricing and explaining how all the incentives worked. He was friendly, helpful and attentive when we met at Frank. He referred us to a young lady for our test drives and for the most part she was familiar with the models and their features. Once we decided to purchase I felt we were pressured and over sold on the Blue Linx subscription as well an extended warranty. Which we did not purchase. The paperwork portion of the process and signing of the loan documents was by far the best I have ever experienced at any dealer ship EVER. The ""desktop"" signing process was fantastic, went very smoothly and streamlined what is normally a very tedious and lengthy process. The young man that handled this process was both professional and very friendly. He and Omar should both be commended for their professional manner,  work ethic and loyalty to Frank. It's because of them that I would not hesitate recommending Frank to friends or coworkers. I spite of all that, overall I would rate our experience at Frank as very good but not excellent due to what I considered too short of test drives and lack of knowledge of the cars features and benefits. As well as not being introduced to anyone in the service department and the feeling of being pressured that I described above.",4.4

Sales staff is inexperienced and very aggressive. Most sales people are excited to make a sale and to make you happy, not at Frank Hyundai. At Frank Hyundai they have their own agenda and are pushy and condescending. When I called them when I had questions the receptionist laughed at me and hung up on me on multiple occasions.",1.8

467,"September 02, 2017","I believe it was Thursday, August 7, 2017.   We went to your dealership to test drive a Sonata.  I was considering a Malibu, Camry and Sonata.  Met with Marco Lucero decided there was a Sonata I liked but it was in a very difficult spot to get out so I test drove a different Sonata but was fine with that because just in the preliminary stages of deciding which car I wanted.  After test drive Marco and his manager Alexander gave us a written quote on the car I liked and we were on our way.  We were very happy with the quoted price.  Went and test drove the other cars.  Decided I wanted to drive the specific car I had picked out and called the dealership Saturday, August 10 in the morning to let them know.  Gave them the stock # of the car and told them we wanted to come by in an hour or so to test drive it.  We explained that it was on the back lot and at least 5 cars deep.  I spoke with Michael who said he was a Manager and we should come in.  When we arrived nothing had been done about getting the car pulled off the extra lot.  We were introduced to Liz and told Marco would be in later.  We were told it would take a while to get the car we wanted.  We actually left for about an hour.  When we returned a different car was pulled up front and they wanted us to test drive it.  We explained again which car we wanted to test drive.  We got in the car that had been pulled up front and it had no gas, it was completely on empty so we drove it a short distance to the lot and pointed out which car we wanted.  It took a very long time at least an hour for Liz and another person to get the car out while we waited there on the extra lot. I finally test drove the car I liked and decided to purchase it.  The paperwork with Finance went well.  When we finished with finance the car was pulled up front, it looked nice it had been washed and had a full tank of gas.   Liz was going to go over the car with me but was told that she had another test drive so another tall man came over.  He asked me for my cell phone and connected it up to the car’s system.  He told me I should drive on Eco to save gas.  That was about it.  I asked him why we were only given one key and he wasn’t sure. He looked in the trunk where the spare time is stored but did not see the extra key there.  He found Liz and she said she would have the second key by Monday.  Then I drove off.  No one had really explained much??????  We have purchased at least 4 Camry’s from Frank Toyota and our salesperson Jimmy spends a crazy amount of time going over all the features. I never got a call from Liz on Monday so I called her Wed.  She was too busy to speak with me???  Left my number.  Finally spoke with Liz on Wed.,  she said it would take 2 weeks to get the key, still don’t have it, but it hasn’t been two weeks since she told me that.  Also want to mention that sometimes when I call the dealership no one ever answers, it just rings and rings.  I am for the most part happy with the car.  I have an appointment because the headlights are pointed at the ground. Our experience was a very strange one.   Please call me if you want to discuss.  619.421.5769",2.6

It has been a frustrating purchase. After spending time going back to the dealership, waiting on finance agents being busy, I had to leave, come back the same thing again with waiting. Finally get help feeling that will resolve and guess what, another call to go back and sign again a new contract. I am exhausted! And on top of that, I still get an early call when I am at work asking for my pay stubs that I had submitted already. I don't understand where is the lack of communication. I do like the dealership, the sales man was awesome (IB) but this paper signing has been exhausting. I do want to come back and purchase another car in the future, but with this experience it has made me to think it twice.  I would like to Thank my car sales man, Ibrahim (IB) and finance lady Jamie Gabriel. They have been super Awesome with me, listening to my exhausting experience, they are professional and attentive. Honestly if it wasn't for Jamie Gabriel I would have just left without any car. I don't need a car, just like the new Sonata, my Sonata 2014 works fine. I do understand that things happen, just try to get it right without so much messing up. I won't share this experience with my family, friends or coworkers who are in the market for a new car. This was just my personal experience and do wish this dealership has it improved.

The test drive was great, Omar was extremely friendly and knowledgeable and I was blown away with the Sonata. We went upstairs to talk pricing and I was pleasantly surprised to see how much the vehicle was discounted from sticker price due to promotions and rebates. Omar didn't attempt any shady sales tactics and he even showed me right on the screen the break down of taxes, trade in, vehicle price, and APR. We worked out a great deal, I signed paper work, my vehicle was ready as soon as the financing paper work was done, and I was out the door in a total of 2.5 hours.

530,"June 16, 2017","The dealership installed a KARR security system that caused my Santa Fe to unexpectedly fail to start 3 days after I purchased it - I had to send my children home in a taxi cab & tow my car to the dealership.  When I called for tow service, I was told that my vehicle was a 2008 Subaru, that it couldn't be found in the system, and that I had to pay out of pocket for the tow service.    The dealership staff's responsiveness to my concerns and needs has been less than adequate.  The fact that I sent my children home in a taxi cab because there weren't enough seats in the tow truck was never addressed - this was a traumatic experience for me and my children.  The fact that I paid $74 for tow service for a 2008 Subaru was never reimbursed.  I waited to complete this survey in the hopes that they would have gone above and beyond for my service and purchase experience, unfortunately I am still waiting.  Alex (manager) said that there would be an adjustment to my contract for the price of the KARR system and I'm still waiting for that to be completed.  I have wanted to purchase a Santa Fe for over two years, this is not how I envisioned my experience with my new Hyundai.  Customer service should be priority in your business.  When things go wrong, making me (your customer) happy should be priority.  I have purchased all of my vehicles at a Frank dealership because of my high school friendship with Leanne Fornaca.

All the sudden they had a white Tuscon in the back lot that was $3,000 less than the one I was looking at. They then informed me that price was after rebates, which is not true because that was the sticker price in the window of the car. We finally came to an agreement on the price I was happy with, I signed the piece of paper agreeing to 0% financing for 72 months. When I went to sign the final paperwork it stated that I would be paying 1.9% financing for 72 months. When I pointed that out they told me that I was wrong and they never offered that. When I insisted they show me the piece of paper I signed it did indeed say that and they then told me ""oh sorry we made a mistake.""

627,"March 15, 2017",I think the young man that was helping me was pleasant but he seemed not that knowledgeable of the details of the car. I had simple questions about how the seat works and he really didn't know that my sit was actually electric and his was not. He seemed to be new on the job and thats ok because he was trying hard to succeed which is a good quality to have.  It seemed to take all time with buying the car I was there 4/2 to 5 hours . Then next day I had to come back because by the time I had bought the car the service department had closed. On the Elantra 13 I had traded in I wanted to get the mileage check to get the gas reimbursement on it and then they said to come back the next day. I came back the next day and then they said I no longer own the car and that I could not get the gas mileage reimbursement  which was very upsetting to me. Later on that week I came back for the financing and then they said well that wasn't true that I still own the car cuz I hadn't really signed the papers yet even thought I was driving the new car . I could have been reimbursed for the mileage 2013 Elantra that I trade it in. So that was upsetting to me then I talked to a  lady in customer service. I felt like I was not being understood by the service department and  lady from customer service.  So I just ask can I just get a free oil change and I will be happy with that instead of going through and getting the gas mileage  on my old car. It was frustrating to have to work this out  there seemed to be a misunderstanding or  poor  communication  in the different departments . This added stress on getting my new car.   The  first time I bought my car with you was a much more  pleasant experience. I do love my new car and I am happy with my choice.,4.0

Other sales people would have given up or become frustrated, but not Rachel. She had a big smile and positive spirit from the time we met to the time I took delivery of my new car.  The price negotiation process with the sales manager was low pressure. The payment, rates, terms and pricing were all straight forward and made it easy to decide which payment worked for me.  The finance person was very respectful of my time and didn't make me feel anything extra was being forced to buy. He presented many options to help protect my new car, like an extended warranty, alarm, gap and pre paid maintenance. Showing how each item would effect my monthly payment and the benefits of each product. After deciding what items to buy, the paperwork process was quick and easy. The finance manager was extremely organized and had everything ready to go.  Overall, the entire sales team made buying a new car here a simple choice.

674,"January 08, 2017","I am extremely displeased with my overall buying experience at this dealership, especially with the finance lady that completed my car buying process. With regards to my salesperson, I don't have much complaints I think he was friendly and tried to help me get a good deal, however looking back I think I would have appreciated if he had gone over all of the features of my vehicle with me and how it was equipped. The problem I have is with the finance lady, I feel completely taken advantage of and I hope to get a resolution to my problem as soon as my paperwork comes in the mail. While discussing the finance of my car, I was offered the warranty which I declined, but I was sold the KARR security system and when I asked the lady what the price was I was told it was around $800 which I thought was excessive but I agreed because I wanted protection for my car. I have now learned that my car already comes with an alarm and a keyless entry I was never told this and had I known I would not have purchased this security system. I looked at my contract and I see that I am being charged $1995 for the KARR alarm- as stated in the contract. This is just ridiculous, and upon further inspection of the paper work I come to find an optional Vehicle replacement agreement with regards to the security system. The lady never told me this was an additional charge and she also did not show me the waiver, I feel like I was taken advantage of as she made it seem as it was part of the KARR security system and not an additional agreement. Also, I saw on my contract that I was charged $850 for a GAP addendum. The lady never told me this insurance was an additional charge and again she made it seem as if it was just part of the contract and gave me a 'recommendation' to always purchase a car somewhere where they offered GAP insurance. I had no idea what this was neither that I had to pay extra. The next day I went in to the dealer to talk to the finance people and since it was the Friday before the holiday weekend everyone was in a hurry and I was told to return the next week on the 27th. Another guy from finance helped me very briefly and I explained the situation and he said the the additional money I was being charged was for the optional Vehicle replacement agreement and he said that they would fix it but to come back. So, I did and I spoke to the finance lady and of course she was not very cooperative and kept lying to me. When telling her about the KARR alarm she said that the optional vehicle replacement was not an additional charge, rather the extra $1000 or so I was being charged was because I had agreed to purchase some finishing touches to the paint of my car. This is completely ridiculous, first she never even told me about any finishing touches, second why would I even want to spend extra on finishing touches for a brand new car, third, my due bill does't even say anything about the finishing touches and I never set up an appointment to do so. On my contract it doesn't even say anything about finishing touches it only says KARR alarm at $1995, I am not dumb and one thing has nothing to do with the other plus I had already been told by the other guy that I was being charged extra for the optional vehicle replacement. I was also asked what loan term I wanted and I chose the 66 months and we had already agreed to that as well as 2.9% APR and my contract says that my term is for 72 months and my APR is 3.99% and when I told her this she said that the term did not matter, but it matter to me because I had chosen the 66 months for a reason and she should not have changed that without telling me first. When I asked her about the GAP insurance she said that the person I was with had already bought a car there and that they should have known that they charge for this insurance. This is the most infuriating thing to me and I even told her that she cannot assume that everyone knows what this is and she should have told me about the charge since I am the one buying the car. I cannot believe that was her justification because every customer has the right to know everything they are agreeing to and she cannot make assumptions like that. Previous to going into the dealer I wanted to inform myself about this situation and I called the Hyundai consumer affairs number and I have a case open, I was told that the dealer can fix this problem and they are all able to cancel the KARR alarm and the additional charges, I was even told that it was a shame that I wasn't explained that my car has its own security system and this KARR alarm is not even needed. However, when I told the lady that I wanted this cancelled she said that it was not possible and I told her what I was told from consumer affairs and she said she would talk to the manager about it, but I don't trust her talking to the manager and I hope I have the opportunity to speak with him myself as soon as I get all of my paperwork in the mail. To make matters even worse, within the first week of purchasing my car the engine did not start twice and I had to call roadside assistance. The second time it had to be taken to the dealer and I was told my car's battery was defective and they replaced it. It is concerning to me that my car has failed twice already and I have only had it for two weeks, one would think that a new car would not have any problems and I hope this doesn't happen again. Once again, what this lady did is take advantage of me and I will continue to call whoever it takes to have this fixed and if it isn't fixed I will have to file a claim and take other measures because it is horrible that situations like these happen. It is a shame that the finance department takes advantage of young drivers like me, and they take advantage of customers being confused and tired after a long car buying process. I will definitely not be recommending this dealer to anyone I know because I wouldn't want them to gro thought the same fraud as I did with this lady.",1.8

I felt like a ""spot delivery"" scam was attempted. I signed a deal for which they said I was approved, then told 8 days later that financing fell through. 8 days! I asked at very beginning of finance meeting if I had an official approval and was told yes. I initially decided not to purchase warranty and gap insurance. When I was called 8 days later, interest rate jumped almost 10% and warranty and gap were added. I only decided to accept deal because dealership had leverage and I needed car.",3.4

Then I was escorted to Finance and the price was boosted over 2100 dollars. I pointed that out and they proceeded to tell me I just agreed to it in the other room. I realize this is how it works. Yet when I said No way I do not want the window tint or the SWAT but How much for the door guards??? They became cynical and indignant and scoffed and said ""probably a 1000 bucks"" basically they were rude and shamed me in front of my daughter for not agreeing to the package deal they just offered and since I did not take the deal I would pay. After I made them find out exactly how much door guards were 285 and I received clarification on what a door guard covered, I declined. My point is this- I know they have to make monies on the certain selling points etc, but when you clown me in front of my kid in the slightest of ways. I draw the line.

869,"January 28, 2016","1.  When buying a new car, search the internet first and get as much info as you could get to be educated with the terms that will be used during the purchase.

3.  Open up the hood of the car and check the condition of the engine if you are satisfied or not.
4.  Don't buy a car before the end of the day because the dealership is about to close.  You will feel like you have to complete all those numerous signatures in order to drive away and head home.  (note:  we were not in a way hurried up).

874,"January 07, 2016","If you are INTERNET competent, not afraid to spend the time doing the online research to refine what new car you want, and want to deal with a NEW GENERATION INTERNET CAR SALES FACILITATOR, read further about my experience with Omar and Adriana at Frank Hyundai.

After test driving new cars, and months of intensive internet researching of reviews and you-tube evaluations, I decided my next car would be a 2016 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid Limited Ultimate Pkg.  I would have waited for the Plug-in version, but I wasn't willing to give up the Panoramic Roof or split back seat (not available on the Plug-in ver).

I attempt to work an online purchase of my new Hyundai with (6) Hyundai dealerships within a 120 mile radius from where I live.  My goal was simple, TO GET THE LOWEST PRICE POSSIBLE, with the least amount of traditional car salesperson ""games"", for the exact Car that I wanted, with a reasonable delivery time frame.  I emailed my desired vehicle out to the Internet Sales Coordinators at each dealership giving them ONLY my email address (not wanting annoying phone calls).  I apologized to each explaining that phone numbers could be exchanged AFTER narrowing down my offers.  I outlined EXACTLY what I wanted as far as the car, EXACTLY what I DIDN'T WANT as far as Dealer add-ons, Dealer financing and extended warrantees.  I detailed what Manufacture incentives I qualified for, and what outside dealer discounts I MIGHT qualify for (Costco, AAA, AMEX, First responder etc.).  I never involved my trade-in in the pricing until the very end of the process.  I made sure I was clear with the prices I wanted (NET DISCOUNTED PRICE-The Dealer's ""price"" subtracted from the MSRP after applying ALL discounts)_and (Out-The-Door Price - Self-explanatory but includes Sales Tax, license and any misc. dealer charges).  I knew ahead of time what dealer charges were reasonable so I could spot any profit add-ons dealers might tack on to help their discounted profit.

I ended up returning to complete my sale with Omar at Frank Hyundai (and his asst. Adriana) who, were coincidentally, the 1st dealership Internet sales Manager that I had contacted.  Omar was ABSOLUTELY the BEST SALES FACILITATOR I could have hoped to assist me in my new car purchase.  Notice I don't refer to him as a Salesman or Sales person as he reflects a new generation of Internet Sales Coordinators that are not locked into all of the traditional sales ""tricks and games"" that every buyer has had in the past from cars salespersons when buying a car.  From the very start, he was truthful, honest, and did not play the salesman ""games"" of the other 5 dealerships.  He gave me his best price upfront and was the only dealer to give me their ""Out-the Door"" final price with breakdown of taxes, licenses and fees WITHOUT even being asked.  In some cases, when I gave a dealer the ballpark number Omar had given me, dealers would give me an extremely high price, or somewhat discounted price.  The only dealer that came close to the OTD price I got from Omar tried to add $780 for a Dealer add-on 3M protection to make up their discounted price.  The other Internet sales person was actually snooty with me when I told them I didn't want the add-on protectant.  It was truly refreshing to have Omar accept my ""Not Interested"" answer and not attempt to pressure me to change my mind.

I did qualify for the Costco New Car program which Frank Hyundai was the participating dealer which may explain their having the best price.  And yes, I did trade in my 2000 V10 Ford Excursion for what was a very fair wholesale price for a high millage, not popular engine used car.

OMAR reflected EVERY QUALITY that today's New Car Dealership Internet Sales Department's should have and practice and NO, I am not a Omar's relative/Neighbor/Bud :). Just an EXTREMELY satisfied Internet New Hyundai owner who was VERY pleased to meet and work with Omar and his asst. Adriana at Frank Hyundai.
