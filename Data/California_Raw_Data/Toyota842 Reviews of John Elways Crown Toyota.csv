0,"March 07, 2020","My wife and I purchased a brand new 2020 Toyota Rav4 in late December 2019 -- and both the dealership and Factory (Plano, TX) would NOT cover the replacement of a Sunroof that had unexpectedly exploded for absolutely NO REASON!!! Their ""Fix"", I was instructed by them to put in a claim with my own insurance carrier -- and for me to pay the deductible for a safety issue and reoccurring problem that is known by other drivers / consumers.
Had to rent a Rental Car from this dealership while they assessed the situation and Warranty Repair work -- but would NOT honor the ""Repairs"" nor would they reimburse me for the 3 days rental car charges. The Rav4 had just 5,000 miles on it. Got the complete ""run-around"" and shoulder shrugs...
Needless to say, we are not at all pleased with their Customer Service Dept. In fact, a week later I''m still waiting for a returned call from the Factory's Customer Service dept. as well. ",1.0
1,"March 05, 2020","Had the best experience at John Elway crown Toyota in Ontario! we worked with Harmon and he was amazing and patient with us!!(I’m picky)
He took us in so many different cars and never not once made me feel like I was being a pain in the butt! I loved that he kept checking on us making sure we were ok while waiting for finance. He was super cool and down to earth! Next time I need a car I’m going back to crown Toyota!! Thank you guys for providing excellent service!",5.0
2,"February 22, 2020","First time buying here and Harmon provided excellent service. The experience was hassle free and to the point which was really appreciated. There were a couple issues with me getting a copy of my proof of insurance and they were helpful with that too.

4,"January 13, 2020","I walked into Crown Toyota searching for a Scion tC I wanted to replace my old one. I was greeted by George and he asked what I was looking for. The dealership had sold the car I wanted a day before so he showed me another model, a certified pre-owned Toyota 86. I fell in love with the car. George was fantastic and he did an amazing job taking care of everything. I walked out that same day with the car. He should be commended. I would go back to see George",5.0
5,"December 15, 2019",Stopped in for a brake service. Jeff my service advisor took the time to listen to my concerns and passed them along to the tech. He had a coupon stashed away that made my maintenance much more affordable and earned my future business.,5.0

8,"November 22, 2019","This dealership a good place to take your car for service. They take care of you. Great customer service. The cons: is it not a good place to stay o wait for your car. Be aware of the techs. They tend to leave oil fingerprints all over the hood and wherever else they come in contact with in your vehicle. They do have a cafeteria. The bad thing is NOT free which is understandable. They want to make extra money. One huge minus is their coffee and water. The coffee is in Jars and it tastes horrible. The water tastes like tap water with ice and some lemon. I have been to other Dealerships and the have a machine that offers a variety of coffee options, filtered water even some donuts or bagels. Thus, waiting for your car to be ready or for finiancing to go through is not very pleasant. My review is mixed because I have had great experience at that dealership and some not so good experiences. Overall, a good place to do business but it needs a lot of improvements. They earned my business once (bought a brand new car--in 2006), but they lost a great opportunity to earn my business (wanted to buy a brand new Avalon Hybrid--in 2018).",3.2
9,"November 20, 2019","Cal helped me buy 2 cars in the past 2 months.  I had 2 Toyota's that were over 15 years old with 250,000+ miles on them and it was time for new cars.  I met Cal and he was awesome to work with.  Took great care of us and gave us great service.  I'm extremely happy with the new cars we have.  John Elway's Toyota is the place to go, and ask for Cal.",5.0

14,"October 20, 2019","We purchased our last 2 cars from John Elway Toyota, because of the no hassle, no pressure and fair pricing.  It is easy to make an appointment, and they often call to remind us when our service is due if we forget to make an appointment.   Their service department is excellent   and we always enjoy having breakfast or  lunch at the cafe while we are waiting.   I have recommended them to all of our friends.   ",5.0

18,"September 24, 2019","From the time I scheduled my online appointment, to dropping off the car and picking it up, everything went smoothly.  Arthur Reynolds, Service Advisor was professional, courteous and helpful.  When he said he would call at a certain time, when the car was ready to be picked up, he followed through.  I plan to contact Arthur for all my car service needs!  And before closing, a big ""shout-out"" to Skylar, Service Advisor, for assisting when Arthur stepped away for a few minutes when I arrived to pick up my car.  He located the paperwork, completed the transaction and gave me a receipt, all while doing his job with a smile on his face!  Thank you Arthur and Skylar for all that you do; you both are much appreciated!                                        ",5.0
19,"September 24, 2019","Setting the appointment was easy with just one phone call. The people here are concerned about what you need and they get it done. I appreciate that they have all the records for my vehicle. And, a side note, a nice cafe and waiting area make it an enjoyable experience! 
I look forward to my next visit!",5.0
20,"September 23, 2019","I had an awesome experience at John Elway's Crown Toyota! I bought my first car from this dealership in 2010 and when I was in the market to purchase another vehicle, I sought out this dealership. I had a great experience with John N - salesman - nine years ago so I sought him out again and he was fantastic. John went out of his way to find a vehicle for me and kept in touch with me all along the way. He truly personifies professionalism, courtesy, honesty, and perseverance to assist the customer. I have never had a problem with this dealership in the nine years I have had with them. I serviced my first Toyota at the dealership every time and will continue to service my new vehicle here also!",5.0
21,"September 10, 2019",I highly recommend John Elway’s Crown Toyota Ontario to do service on your car. They finished my car in less than a day replacing 3 safety recall parts. Compared to the first Toyota Service I took my car to. Larry H. Miller had my car for 8 days and didn’t replace any safety recall parts in my car. It made me walked everyday 3 miles hoping I could get my car on the 2nd week. Im giving John Elway’s Crown Toyota 5-star! The people at the service reception people were so nice. ,5.0

23,"September 07, 2019","Steve Nash helped us in purchasing a prius prime. He was very knowledgeable friendly and helpful. I would totally go through the entire car buying process with him again.

24,"September 06, 2019",Loved working with Jose Serrano excellent service and great hospitality.  Was able to come to a price immediately no need to waste time with other dealerships!,5.0
25,"August 24, 2019","I worked with Mike Breicha and he got me a great deal without all the BS. I was in test drive and went through finance with Ali all in about 2 hours which is very fast for buying and trading in a car. The deal was amazing and the process was quick. If you are looking for a toyota I would go no where else. They also have a cafeteria so my young sons were entertained with some delicious fries while the deal was finalized. I rarely write evaluations, I could not recommend Crown Toyota more. Worth the drive where ever you are coming from. ",5.0
26,"August 21, 2019","Though I ended up not purchasing the car I came to see, I wanted to acknowledge how positive the experience at this dealership was.  My current car met with misfortune and got totaled recently, so my current car shopping adventure is both unavoidable and unwanted. I have had a range of experiences at dealerships across SoCal, and this was by far the best. 

My sales agent was enthusiastic, informed, respectful, fair, not at all pushy. I chose not to purchase the used car that I looked at here, and my one major regret is that I would have rather worked with the  team here than any other dealership I've visited. It is important to feel confident that you are working with honest people, and that is the impression I had here.  ",5.0

32,"July 15, 2019","I decided to have my Toyota Tacoma serviced by your company.  At the scheduled date and time of my appointment, I was greeted by Mike Figueroa. He gave me the estimated cost of repair and time of completion. Both estimate turn out to be accurate.

Mike is courteous and helpful. He makes the customer feel at ease with his demeanor. While I am waiting at the cafeteria, he texted me to ask me if there is something else he could help me with.",4.8

34,"June 25, 2019",Bought our Highlander at another dealer in 2002. Have been taking it to Crown Toyota location service dept. soon after.

36,"June 15, 2019","I always take my car to Kon Baur. I totally trust him and his team. He is the reason I take my car to Elway Crown  Toyota and the reason I bought the one I own now. It is very hard to find a place to take your car that, you don’t have to be worried about taken advantage of . Elway Crown Toyota is the only place 
I ‘ll ever go.",5.0
37,"June 14, 2019","Without an appointment and in the middle of the day, I entered the Service department. Tom assisted me quickly and very efficiently. My wait time in the lounge was very short.

41,"May 18, 2019","I love getting my service done here. They are pretty on point with the estimated time your vehicle will be ready. Even though shuttle service is available, I usually stay in and wait.

49,"February 04, 2019",My husband baought  a certified Tundra that was very well maintained and it served him well and never had major problems. Later when we needed another car we purchased a certified 4 runner. The sales person was very gentle and professional. We bought the truck with warranty and it was honored when we took it in for servicing. The servicing manager we dealt with was also very professional and new everything about our truck. He didn’t try to sell any maintenance that wasn’t required or covered by the warranty. I recommend this dealership because of the professionalism and respect we have received thus far. It was easy to engage with everyone you come across. ,4.8

55,"December 19, 2018","So far I've been very impressed with Crown Toyota.  I had my 1st service appointment and was surprised to hear they only do oil changes @the 10,000 mile. Also when they returned the car I was expecting it to be washed. However, when I asked about it they stated they stopped washing the cars 2 years ago because of the drought and never started washing again. ",4.4

I have been using for all my Toyota scheduled maintenance needs since year 2000. I have seen many service team managers, and they are all great. I am always getting the best service and advice whether for my newer Toyotas or for my older ones (220k miles).

Before leaving, I would like to extend my special thanks to Jorge Valdez who facilitated and expedited servicing two of my Toyotas on the same, very busy weekday (Friday). Jorge also booked my pickup and drop off shuttle service between home & dealership, which made my life a lot easier.

Before I leave, Crown Toyota shuttle service is GREATTTTT.",5.0

72,"September 05, 2018","Customer service at John Elway Crown Toyota, is their number one priority. From the first day I bought my truck. I’ve had some minor issues, and Crown Toyota staff took care of me. 

The only reason, I gave 4 stars instead of 5, is because their phone system is terrible! If you have an extension to reach a specific person. The system, automatically, transfers you, to the operater instead of the person. If you leave messages they’re never heard. 

Other than that, the staff treat you like family. ",4.8

I was most definitely go back to do business there in the future again by all means. I traveled from San Diego County to make my purchase as I had looked at many other dealerships and was not treated with fairness or respect that i was given at Crown Toyota.

Jeff is easy to talk to, knowledgeable, and thorough. I left feeling that my car & I were safe. I drive some distance to have my car serviced here. The reason is the facility and the people.",5.0
76,"August 17, 2018","I have had a bad experience last week. I have been bringing my both cars for service at this dealer ship for last 3 years. this is the second time they were not honest. Rep name Vanessa R. charged me $20 more then the advertised price for an oil change.  I asked her that i sound too much. She said price went up @89.99. she just charge more Because I look different and naive! I complained to the manager. I had to spend 2:45 to get oil change. I asked why it is taking long and then they said they were doing thorough inspection. When I got my car back they said that timing belt has oil leak and it will be $2001 to repair. I think they were messing up with my car because I complained. Usually it take 1:10 to 1:30 min. If you complain about anything they will mess up your car to make more money.  People came after me left long time before me. I learned my lesson the hard way.
I will never go back.",1.2

85,"July 13, 2018",My experience was great ave purchased at least 15 cars from dealerships in my lifetime and this was by far the easiest and quickest. Sales man was friendly and did not make me feel pressured. Finance people were great as well! The only thing I didn't like was the no hagle price. I got a good deal I just felt awkward paying sticker price. But end result was I got the car at a good deal compared to other of the same cars. Thank you crown toyota.

He answered all of our questions and made the process really easy.  Before I left he went over all the car’s buttons, screens , and options one last time.  He helped me sync my cell phone via Bluetooth to my new car and made sure everything was to my satisfaction.

101,"April 04, 2018","I had my car towed in because it wouldn’t start... They ran a Diagnostic .. called me on the phone and told me that I needed a new starter and a starter relay and it was $743... I said ok I need my car to work so go ahead and install it... When my car was ready I got another phone call stating that my car was ready it was running and ready to go.. The Person On The Phone asked me .. have you noticed you have a knock when you start the engine... I said no Ive never heard a knock, I don’t know what that even means, he said well you just have to make sure you keep oil in it and every should be fine.. I said ok the dealership service closed at 5, I got there at 4:30... stood in line Paid the $743 and got my car at about 4:52... I got 1/2 a mile down the street and my car shut off.. I tired to start the car again, it would not start and the engine started smoking... I had my car towed back to the dealership the same day... the service department was closed at that time so I had to wait until Monday to talk to someone about what was going on with my car... Long Story Short.. On Monday They gave me a rental car and by Tuesday they told me that my engine had seized and it would cost me $6500 to have it replaced.... I Feel With every fiber of my being that they knew I needed a new engine when they initially ran their diagnostic but didn’t tell me... They were completely dishonest with me From The Beginning... I Feel Scamed, Taken Advantage Of And Really Hurt By their actions... I thought I was doing the best thing I could by taking it to an actual Toyota dealership versus a regular body shop... But I was left with my car in worse condition then when I brought it in, and I’m out $743. Their solution was for me to buy a new car from them... Yeah right,

130,"December 09, 2017","I generally don't take the time to write negative reviews but I believe this time it's warranted. My cousin and I went to Crown Toyota to meet up with Eric to test drive a 2015 Mustang GT.  When we arrived Eric said that the car was parked in the garage next to the showroom.  I thought it was kinda odd the car was separated from all of the other vehicles but my gut feeling was to pay extra attention to the car.  I inspected the car it was pretty obvious that it had been in an accident and Eric asked me how I knew.  I pointed out the scraped paint around the bolt heads that secure the fender to the car, the fender didn't align properly with the door.  He took one quick look and stated that the passenger side fender looks just the same!  I pointed out the flaws again and he dismissed what I said and stated that the CarFax was clean and explained that every used car goes through a thorough inspection before it sells on the lot.  Okay whatever....so he starts up the car and it sounded REALLY good but a bit on the loud side so I'm thinking there's possibly an aftermarket exhaust installed. 

The test drive was quick and there was some squealing from the front of the car but that wasn't a major concern.  When we got back to the dealership Eric called out his manager to speak with us because we weren't willing to pay the asking price for the car since Crown Toyota's pricing policy is fixed. The manager addressed our concerns and looked at the car and said that it wasn't in an accident.  Since we parked outside in direct sunlight the flaws in the car were much easier to see.  We found out that the driver's side rim had curb rash and was touched up with some generic matte black paint that didn't match to hide the damage, we also found out that the reason the car was so loud was that it was missing BOTH mufflers!  The driver's side mirror was also poorly repainted and the clear coat was bubbling from the edges and I even pointed out the inner fender fasteners and the headlight fasteners were rounded off and the manager insisted that the car was NEVER in an accident.  He then stated that maybe the headlight needed to be changed so the fasteners were taken off (on a 2 year old car!?!?), that Ford's paint job isn't always the best, and made every other excuse to deny that the car was damaged to get us to buy the car. At that point, I didn't even bother to explain that the sanding scratches can be seen underneath the repainted fender in direct sunlight because the body shop was in rush and didn't care.  I've been working on cars for over 20 years so it's pretty annoying when the staff kept denying the obvious.  

I went with my gut feeling and told my cousin so just skip this car since there's just WAAAAY too many flaws, inconsistencies, and misleading statements that we received from the salesperson and manager.  My only guess as to why the car was in a dark garage was to hide the flaws.  In conclusion, I would NOT trust this dealership to purchase a new or used car due to the misleading statements that were given by the staff. The last thing that the manager said to me that stood out was: ""Just because you pointed out these flaws doesn't mean we're going to lower the price of the car because it's already priced aggressively""  LMAO..... Awesome way to win over customers by trying to pawn off damaged goods at market value. Eric also had the nerve to call us the next day and insisted that the car has never been in an accident. I should have taken photos of the damaged areas to add to this review but was too wrapped up in arguing with the manager to do so. 

About 2 weeks later I get a message on Yelp from Carlos C. and I quote ""I think so you just looking for attention , wasting my time and yelp comunity""  

My response:

You might try rereading your messages a few times before hitting the send button.  It took a while before I could decipher it.  

The negative Yelp review was my EXACT experience at your dealership.  There was no embellishment, exaggeration, or seeking of attention that you speak of. If your sales staff, managers, and mechanics at John Elway's Crown Toyota in Ontario, were better trained in customer service you wouldn't get any negative reviews.  

You had the EXACT Ford Mustang that we were looking for and we were ready to purchase if it was the right car.  I found a bunch of flaws with the car and pointed them out,  we were willing to put up issues but instead of acknowledging the problems, your salesman and manager flat out denied them and made a bunch of excuses to convince us to buy.  Here are a few tips that would save you a bunch of headaches in the future.

1)  If you're buying used cars from the Manheim Auction, spend a little extra time going through their inspection report and pay attention to the flaws.  They're pretty thorough and it'll save you headaches down the line.
2) If you're flipping trade-in's it's probably best to decline the beaters or just send it straight to the auctions versus selling them on the lot
3)  Your mechanics are busy BUT details are important. They did the standard maintenance on the car, but how do they overlook 2 missing mufflers? LOL What if they missed safety features that were missing?  You open up the dealership to liability and litigation.
3)  Your sales guys need better training.  If a customer has issues with a car, simply acknowledge the problem and offer them another alternative.  If they decline....LET IT GO! Denying obvious issues only brings up mistrust and a difficult sales process.  Also a clean Carfax report isn't always strong selling point and the salespeople need better material versus repeating the same thing over and over again. It's like forcing a girl to date you when she's not interested.....if you act weird, lie, and chase they'll run.  This same principle applies to potential customers.
4) Your manager needs additional training.  He's there to help the sales guys move inventory, solve problems, and take care of customer issues.  It doesn't help the sales process if the manager denies the obvious issues with the car.  

The manager said....and I quote ""I deal with cars all day, I don't see anything wrong with the car, it's never been repainted, Ford doesn't always have the best paint job, we have fixed pricing and it's aggressively priced, just because you pointed out a few things doesn't mean we're going to lower the price.""  There was nothing positive about anything he said.  How is that going to help the sales process?

5) All of your sales staff needs additional training in ALL AREAS of communication with clients.  You're not going to increase sales or win over disgruntled clients by ignoring their concerns or sending inappropriate condescending messages via Yelp.  

Thank you again for reading my review on Yelp and taking the time to message me.  I hope you have a good weekend with lots of sales and finish strong before the end of the year!

134,"November 19, 2017","Ramon Cervantes was absolutely great. When we first arrived we were unsure about purchasing a car here. While many salesmen sometimes don’t like to waste their time when you look uncertain about purchasing or you just say “we’re just browsing”, Ramon did not, and he patiently accompanied us the hours that we were here. He was extremely patient and neither I nor my parents felt rushed or pressured at any point. He made sure our needs were met and went above and beyond to make sure my parents got the exact car the exact way they wanted it. This dealer didn’t have the exact car my parents wanted (color, trim, interior) but Ramon looked around and found it and personally drove it to the dealer himself rather than try to get us to agree to something different than what they wanted.

146,"April 02, 2017",My son had his toyota camry seviced for engine oil and filter changed at your prestigious service center but when he arrived home I was so disappointed to see that there were quite a number of oil smudges on top of the engine especially the black plastic cover of the engine very near the engine oil cap. My guess was that the mechanic who attended to my son's car did not bother to use a FUNNEL that is why when the mechanic pour the new engine oil he missed the opening that was why there were oil spill marks on the engine. The mechanic did clean the smudges but not clean enough as they were still very obvious and untidy to look at. Maybe next time your mechanics can use funnels in pouring in oil or any fluids to avoid smears or smudges especially if they can not clean it well.

252,"August 23, 2016","Don't ever... ever buy used car from this dealership. Sales people that harp on the one price no games. Fail to tell you that the only games they play are the managers and service mechanics manipulating things in their favor so that they don't have to come out of pocket for lousy service. I purchased a used vehicle from them not even 3 months ago, not a week after leaving the loft I was hit with multiple lights in my dash.  Having a mechanic of my choice troubleshoot the codes, telling me what was wrong to know when I took it back to the stealership. When dropping the vehicle off I stated the exact issue. Simply resetting the code they told me the vehicle was fixed and ready to be picked up that the issue was taken care of. A week or so later the exact issue comes up again.. crown has a 3,000 mile warranty for used vehicle purchases. So happens that my vehicle doesn't cover it now that I have driven it for about 2000 miles or so. Still under the the 3000. They tell me they sell extended coverages which wasn't offered to me and I stated to them that it wasn't in the contract. The Are admitting  that the original problem I toke it in for is in fact the problem that is throwing the check engine light and their response to helping me out is doing a in house cost repair which is only 300 off a almost 1300 dollar repair. Not to my satisfaction I spoke with a manager about this issue and he told me basically crown doesn't have to do anything for you... you bought a 150k milage vehicle expect problems. Poor, lazy or con mechanics cleared the code to only come back on again to let me drive more miles for them to justify not having to fix this issue. The whole your getting a great car for a better price is a scam... straight bs... I paid about 2k over blue book being told constantly that don't worry you'll have a piece of mind knowing your getting a trouble free great car... O ya... we at crown pride ourselves on customer service and we're at the top for customer satisfaction. Even with haggling with a manager I won't say his name he offered to pay 350 of the cost of the repair if I were to take it to a private mechanic to fix. Well that doesn't even cover the cost of the part... bottom line is this dealership is no better than a dealership you see on the corner of a street or a craigslist dealer... they want to push problematic cars off the lot fast as they can without having to do close to no repairs. Beware of dealing with the used car side you can never ask to many questions. Get everything in writing... even if you do that they'll find a way to manipulate their guidelines to not fix initially what should have prior to even putting it up for sale. Since purchasing this vehicle the light hast came on 15 times.. 15 and I counted and documented them and called crown about it to the service writer knows as well. 0 stars if I could honestly. But hey they put new tires on",1.4

Tonya, Sales Consultant: No pressure tactics; definitely a sales professional. Friendly, knowledgeable, and took the time to get to know her potential client. Made sure every step of the sales process was going smoothly for me.

Mike, Finance Manager: Easy going as well; I was expecting the barrage of extra packages dealers try to sell you; ext. warranty, GAP covg., etc..., I respectfully declined them and Mike accepted my declination without attitude. Being in sales myself, I understood and can respect his persistence. Mike tried a bit more towards the end, but he did it in a light hearted way.

Overall review: I like their ""One Price"" system; avoids the typical b.s. I had Tonya explain the philosophy and concept behind it, along with the metrics they use.

And now as of Sunday May 31st my transmission needs to be replaced and I have only driven the car for two months and added 2000 miles, how is it that I need a new transmission, I'm sure the dealership knew that there was something wrong with the car that is why they sold it tome AS IS in the clause. I don't believe that they put the car threw 18 point inspection like they claim they did or something would have came up as a problem on their computers as they were running diagnostics. I would be very weary of buying a car from them or referring anyone to them. Then you have to be careful with the finance dept. because they aren't up front about the warranty, and when you ask a question they just push it under the rug and move on, and then if you question it again or anything  make sure you aren't talking to Randall Bedill or  ""Randy"" as he called himself the  finance manager, he was rude when I questioned him about my loan.

334,"May 09, 2015","I have bought close to 100 vehicles during my lifetime, for business as well as personal use.  I travel a great deal because of my business and decided to trade in my vehicle and decided to look at Toyota.

I met Tony Pouria and without any pressure whatever, he gave me all the details on the Toyota Tundra including price.  Later my wife and I decided that if the figures he gave us were accurate, we would consider that vehicle. We returned and discussed the terms, price and details of the vehicle we wanted.  The color we decided on was not available and had to be ordered.  We agreed to buy the vehicle at the agreed on price and it was ordered.  What was most impressive to us was there was no demand for us to make a down payment, or sign a contract.

I must admit I was a bit surprised but Tony assured us that the vehicle would be delivered as ordered.     51 days later, the Tundra was ours!
 As previously stated, I have bought many vehicles over my lifetime from many different dealers and have never had such a positive experience.  It was a pleasure dealing with Tony and the trust he showed to us was impressive.  The price was right and the vehicle came exactly as we ordered.  We thank him from the bottom of our hearts for making this purchase such a pleasure!  He is a tribute to the dealership.

The biggest problem was my engine being blown out and me not being able to drive my car. I was stressed out, worried and out of a car. I traded my piece of junk into John Elway and they were very aware of the problems since they ran a diagnostic on the car and still gave me a pretty penny. Justin Sebring helped me with this whole process, he let me know cars they had in stock, and how much I would get for my old car. Justin was great! He has a great personality and isn't aggressive or pushy. The car deal wasn't the best so I wasn't too pleased with that but I went through my bank and got a better deal. Overall it was an amazing experience and I feel so much better about the new car I bought and I feel a lot safer on the road. Thanks Crown Toyota!

There is a Toyota dealer in the city I live in but I was told when I called that they don't carry manual transmission and won't be carrying them in the future either. I really was hoping to keep my tax dollars in my city but not gonna happen. My friend had purchased a New Corolla last year and recommend Crown Toyota. I checked their inventory online and they had a handful of 6 speeds. So I made an online request to test drive.
Within 30 mins I had an email from Tonya and I made arraignments to go test drive. I got all the way up to the doors and no one ""pounced"" on me like I've had happen at other dealerships. I test drove the 6 speed and an automatic. I got a brochure and print outs and asked a bunch of questions. 2 months or so later I am finally ready and had been communicating to Tonya throughout the whole time. She really went out of her way to get me the car I wanted. I checked in with her 2 days before I planned to go buy the car and she assured me there were 3 cars in the color I wanted. They sold them all by the next day. Tonya went to another dealership that's about 60 miles away. I got the car I wanted in the color I wanted and I am a happy camper!

We will be sure to let friends and family know this is a dealership you can trust. This is our third purchase from John Ellway Toyota in Ontario and next time we're in the market for a car it will be where we return -- hopefully Tonya will be there to help again. ",5.0
387,"January 29, 2015","We are so lucky to come to this dealership to buy our 3rd car with Tonya Tillema. She is so knowledgeable, friendly and smart, that we just keep coming to buy cars with her help every time we need the car. Tonya was so helpful and so professional in comparison with other dealership professionals, that we came to conclusion that we would not find a car and a salesperson at other dealerships like Longo, Citrus, Nissan and others, that could beat experience of working with Tonya and with John Elway Toyota. We feel so blessed, because we found exact car, features, payment and good price for our trade, also Ron in finance is very prompt, helpful and professional-just great experience overall! Thank you Tonya, Ron and John Elway Toyota!
Sincerely,

395,"January 01, 2015","Good morning and Happy New Year to all. My name is Steffen Malek. I wish I could say my experience shopping for a car at John Elway's Crown Toyota was good but it was horrible. I will briefly recount my experience for you. I have been dealing with Mike Breicha via the internet to attempt to lease a vehicle. He did provide me with information over the phone but turned out to be false when we got there. When I arrived at the dealership a gentleman by the name of Lewis Vargas greated me and my family and proceeded to take my information to work up numbers for me. Lewis seemed to be a very nice guy however, he had to leave and turned me over to Robert Cruz (Attitude). A very sarcastic gentleman whose response to my Mom, when she asked if the seats on the Camry had special seatcovers you can order ""Doesn't all cars have seat covers"". He was very RUDE and unhelpful with all of his answers to me and my families questions we asked. Following the drive Mike and Robert presented me with an offer. I asked if it could be lower and they said no it was firm. I asked if I could get a lower model at a better price and they said no.It was clear to us that they did not want to sell a car to us or even try to work out a deal like most dealerships do when you are inquiring about a vehicle. So I said ok let me have my registration back (I was tradeing a 2012 leased Honda civic ex). THEY LOST MY REGISTRATION AND DID NOT MAKE A CONCERTED EFFORT TO FIND IT. (I am also now missing my license that i gave to them in which i didint realize untill i had already left the dealer.) I COMPLAINED TO THE DESK MANAGER AND HE ONLY GAVE LIP SERVICE NEVER FOUND IT, RIDICULOUS. HOW CAN AN ORGANIZATION AS BIG AS YOURS LOOSE A CUSTOMERS REGISTRATION AND LICENSE? I AM TOTALLY BLOWN AWAY AND DISGUSTED. I FELT EMBARASSED AND LIKE A SECOND CLASS CITIZEN. I AM A HARDWORKING MIDDLE CLASS GUY WHO FELT LIKE I WAS NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO BE IN YOUR DEALERSHIP. I WOULD LIKE MY REGISTRATION AND LICENSE BACK. I AM TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED AND WOULD WELCOME AN AUDIANCE WITH THE GENERAL SALES MANAGER OR GENERAL MANAGER. MY WHOLE FAMILY WAS THERE AND WITNESSED THIS ATROCITY. MY MOM AND DAD OWN A TOYOTA AND NOW THEY ARE QUESTIONING YOUR PRODUCT JUST BECAUSE OF THIS INCIDENT. I AM VERY UPSET OVER THIS INCIDENT AND WILL CONTINUE TO ADVERTISE THIS TERRIBLE SERVICE INCIDENT. ",1.0

We also had a pleasant, if somewhat long, experience  with Jimmy Barilla, the finance representative. 

My only recommendation would be that the sales team be a bit more clear about what the finance representative's role was going to be in the process of finalizing the transaction, and/or that the finance representative take the time to explain the process before beginning. Both groups assumed that we had knowledge that in fact we did not.

421,"September 02, 2014","I was referred by Costco to this dealership and got assigned to my dealer James Miller. He was friendly over the phone when he first contacted me and said he'd take good care of me if I could just visit him in the office, which I did. Big mistake.

We scheduled an appointment for 11AM and I only got to talk to him 11:30AM. No water, no apologies. We went over the price I wished to get and showed him other dealers were offering the same deal. He immediately got uncomfortable with the competitive price and became extremely pushy by saying ""OK, that's a very very low price and we're losing money on this. If you're not planning to get the car today. I don't want to waste my time on you."" I politely told him that I had every intention to complete this deal as I believed Costco's auto buying program. So he agreed to beat the price by $100 to seal the deal.

The next day we came back to test drive the car. I mentioned that the tire pressure warning light was on, and he explained to me the reason was because the weather was too hot. I didn't say anything. But high temperature would actually increase tire pressure instead of lowering it and causing the low pressure warning. So he didn't know what he was talking about and let his customer test drive a car that's potentially unsafe.

Later when we were ready to sign the documents, we found out he'd inflated acquisition fees, double taxed, and added unnecessary fees which he couldn't explain, and just said that's the number the computer gave him. I even asked him to go over the numbers with me since it's much higher than the number I'd expected from the negotiated price we'd reached the day before. At that moment, he basically just stood up and said he's done with me.

This is our 5th time buying a car and absolutely the first time seeing a rep with that much attitude and rude customer service. We walked out and happily got our car with a price that's $432 lower than what he'd promised from another dealership at the same day within an hour.

I really liked that Prius but the truth of the matter is when I came in to get the proper documentation to take to my credit union I was confronted with a racism or ignorant loan officer.  I had already decided to finance the Prius through my own credit union. However, the signing consultant ROB? I think... was god awful. Not only was his customer service incompetent, but impersonal and not very helpful about going over concerns. He didn't take the time to explain nor listen to what I needed.  He abruptly was set on the price for the warranty insurance and Gap ""AND"" said no can't do, but maybe someone with more authority  can work something out, but NOT ME!!!. I can't even believe he said that. He even had the nerve to tell me that I really wasn't buying anything until I sign for it. ""AND"" to think about it! I was shocked.  Lastly, it's up to you if you want to come back or not since there are other buyers.  So I hope you understand that after this experience there is no way I was I going to deal Toyota and his pushy and rude attitude.....

Please forward to this email to the proper manager since the loan guy or preparer of documents shouldn't be in this position or the very least get some customer service training.   

I will be posted some blogs on yelp and the business bureau about this experience. I hope that this guy doesn't come across this way with all customers. I would say that the experience and the perception he left was impersonal and somewhat racist or bluntly ignorant. . Kind of sucks that they treat their customers this way.

On good note: the actual sales person Jesse was incredibly responsive and helpful in discussing the purchase of the vehicle.",2.2

451,"June 11, 2014","This is our 3rd  new vehicle in which we have purchased with John Elway Crown Toyota and this was by far our most enjoyable experience. Our sales representative Mike Lee was absolutely amazing. From the get go, Mike was not pressuring, he took time to answer our questions, took us on a test drive and allowed Lisa and I the comfort of thinking about what we wanted than to persuade or box us in to decide. I truly appreciated Mike's personality as he made us feel right at home and in a matter of 5 minutes assessed our vehicle and provided an offer that was everything we could have asked for. Not only did Mike help through the process, but went out of his way to go to San Bernardino himself to pick up our vehicle that night to the specifications we were wanting and bring it back and called us to finalize.  If that were not enough, he continued to follow up with us the next morning to make sure that we were happy with our purchase and invited us at our leisure to return to help teach us about the Blue tooth features and our connections with our phones on his day off!  Mike's  comment,  ""no problem"" and came to meet us at the dealership.  Both Lisa and I cannot express our sincere appreciation to Mike and to the staff at Toyota for providing service which was and continues to be superior. I  cannot say this enough, in lew of having been at BMW looking to purchase which was no where near this quality of face to face service nor workability. Mike you are amazing and Toyota is lucky to have such a representative who shows such care to his customers.

452,"June 11, 2014","After visiting Crown Toyota  last October (2013) I was contacted by phone by Beatrice Garcia an outstanding lady at Crown Toyota and asked me if was going  to buy a truck, and I told her that I was just looking and that I was not going to ready until the first of the 2014.  Beatrice ask me if she could contact me then, and I said yes.  She contacted me in Jan. and Feb. Itold her I still was not ready yet and thanked her for the calls.  Beatrice called me in March and I told her that I was ready to buy.  I told her what I wanted to buy and what it was going to cost me.  She called me back withing 5min. with a price that was given to her from Vince Folia (sales manager) .  I counterd back with a price and again within 5min. Beatrice called me back and told me that Vince accepted my counter offer.  I told her SOLD, go ahead and order my Tacoma since what I wanted was not available. Beatrice told me that it would take about nine weeks to get my truck and I told her that was fine.  And nine weeks later I had my new Tacoma.  I call Beatrice my little Pit Bull (and I mean that in a good way).  Since last Oct.2013 she latched on to me and did not let go until she knew that I was completely satisfiied and happy with my purchase,  which I am.  Thank you Beatrice.  I purchased three other cars from Crown Toyota in the past and this the best experience I have had with Crown and I didn't even have to  leave my house. Thanks again Beatrice and Vince ",4.8
453,"June 10, 2014","Dealing with the sales person was a pleasant experience, he was kind and really tried to help us. Dealing with the manager made this experience terrible. We were ignored, when the manager did bother to come over he kept telling us it would be 30 minutes, it was closer to 2 hours! He was disrespectful and unprofessional. When my husband went up to him to ask if he could get a ride so he could sell our old car Vincent first asked him if we were going to give him an excellent review. When my husband kindly told him it wouldn't be excellent but it would be good Vincent then said he didn't want to do the deal anymore. Simply because we told him he wasn't going to get a perfect hundred he rather we leave so his score wouldn't be affected. After that rude remark we told him we didn't want the deal, no reason to do business with people who only treat you like a money bag. The GSM came over to ask what happened when we explain he tried to justify the rude remarks, we then left. I cannot believe it is the higher ups that would be the problem. But if they can't be professional it makes it tough to trust anyone at this dealership.",1.6

461,"May 28, 2014","We wanted to take a minute to say how much we enjoyed working with Justin Sebring on the purchase of our new Toyota Tundra!  My husband called to speak with Justin (after reading some favorable online reviews about him on DealerRater.com) before we drove to the dealership. My husband described to Justin the vehicle we were looking for. When we arrived at the dealership, Justin was available, personable, very friendly (and funny!). He was not pushy or intimidating at all. He quickly got our two vehicles appraised for their trade-in values and showed us the truck my husband had described to him on the phone. Even when we changed our minds about the color of the vehicle we wanted, he found the ""perfect one"" buried somewhere on the lot and drove it up to the front for us to see. We didn't have to walk long distances to see it which was great considering it was close to 100 degrees that day!  Justin did his very best in helping us negotiate a deal we would be comfortable and happy with. He treated us with respect and we felt he was being completely honest with us the entire time we were working with him. It took quite awhile to complete our purchase (several hours) but considering it was Memorial Day and the dealership was extremely busy, we understood and Justin was always around making sure we were comfortable while we waited. A very nice, professional young man!

My husband and I are extremely happy with our new truck and how we were treated at Crown. Justin made the experience much more pleasant than it could have been (and from past experiences, it's been a nightmare!). He's a fantastic salesman who puts the customer first, makes them feel at ease and never pressures them in any way, shape or form. THAT is so refreshing!

We will definitely refer friends and family to Justin in the future and if he is still around when we need another vehicle, we'll be requesting him as well! 

Thank you, Justin!  You rock!!

Justin sebring was the first to great me and was extremely helpful in finding Dan for me. He didn't try and take over the sale. The thing I liked most was that I told them what I could give & they worked with what I had. They never once asked for more money.

468,"May 23, 2014","I brought to the service manager's attention about my brand new Prius Plug In Hybrid battery becoming dead after it was parked at a covered LAX airport area x roughly 1 week. With the remote key not even able to open the car doors, I had to manually open the driver door with the metal key and called AAA to jumpstart the car. When I brought it to the toyota dealer service manager's attention  (Mr Buenrostro) the following day, he showed me a blogposts (www.priuschat.com) detailing similar battery bproblems experienced by other people with the prius and the prius plug in (PIP). He recommended buying a trickler charger or a portable jumpstart kit. I find this unacceptable especially buying a new car roughly a month old. After several discussions with  the customer relations lady Isabel, she recommended leaving my car in their dealership when I go for a few days or weeks vacation (i have to provide my own car rental) and they will try to prolong the batteries life by removing one of rhe fuses (which they intend to teach me). I find the it unacceptable that the dealer was not upfront and I was not told about this problem during the sales talk prior to the purchase. It seemed more that certain information about this issue were witheld probably deliberately. Knowing about this battery issue would have significantly played a role in my decision making. They claim that this was the ""normal"" characteristic of the battery. It does not sound normal if your brand new car battery is dead if  unused/parked for roughly a week .and needs jumpstarting. The only advise offered is to teach me how to remove one of the fuse prior a long trip so as to prolong battery life. Isabel, the customer relations girl in a way insinuated that I should have done more research prior to purchasing the car. ",1.6

Ray Rodriguez was very cordial and informative. He showed me the other options I could get for my vehicle. He didn't push me into buying the warranties or protection plans.

Our RELATIONSHIP began on approximately April 25th via the Internet, with Tonya.  I truly appreciated her informative, friendly, non ""PUSHY"" emails.  That same demeanor pretty much carried over when we visited your dealership on Sunday.

 

We (my husband and I) relaxed and felt very welcomed when we were introduced to Tonya.  Due to the fact that Tonya was currently with two customers already, she introduced us to Al, and again we felt very warmed, and relaxed while working with Al.  Our warm, welcomed feeling carried on throughout our entire experience with your dealership (from the start with Tonya, to Al, even to Ray in Finance.  We never once felt like just a number.  We felt like family, like home.

 

We have worked with other car dealerships before - on new vehicles, used vehicles, other Toyota dealers, and several non-Toyota dealers.  Hands down yours is and was the most enjoyable buying experience we have ever had.  

 

We look forward to a long RELATIONSHIP with our new family at CROWN TOYOTA.”

As you know, when calling most dealers to ask questions and look for some guidance you would typically not get the support expected. Well, not with Justin Sebring, Justin was very cool and I picked up on his honesty and wiliness to truly help and not just looking for a sale. Justin took the time over the phone to answer all my questions and added some points that  I was not thinking of; I actually got a phone call back with some additional information prior me making the decision of coming in.

Once arrived Justin was available to welcome me and immediately got down to business. While having someone in his team evaluate my trade in, we started to review my options. I had gotten a few appraisals for my vehicle and John Elway's Crown Toyota gave me the most for my car so that was my second sign that I was at the right place. 
Long story short, the whole experience from making the call, Justin's way of making me feel like family and Crown Toyota giving me the most value for my car and great price,  I am completely satisfied with my experience and will not go anywhere else at this time for my next car. This is my first Toyota and I love it.

Financing - Adam Dickson does not fall behind. Adam made the process painless while taking the time to go over all my additional warranties and advantages while making me feel like a close friend.

After picking out our brand new 2014 Toyota Tacoma 4X4, I learned that Tony had only been with the Toyota dealership for 3 days! (could have fooled me!) I also learned that he had been in the business for over 20 years handling financing. When we came down to the financing and contracts, Tony never left our side. ( Even after he was off the clock for over 3 hours) Tony sat there and explained EVERYTHING to us. 
We signed papers with Ruben who was also very helpful in informing us of GAP protection & all the other bells & whistles. He helped give me a break down of all my maintenance that was going to be needed. Ruben was amazing in every way possible... (Except, liking the Raider, Go Packers!!=) 
After finishing up with Ruben, Douglas approached us with our owners manual. Douglas taught us how to hook in our son's car seat and how to connect our Bluetooth. Gave us a full run down of the amazing truck we just bought.
I really was impressed that Douglas was extremely kind and also made sure to be a coach to Tony on how to do everything with our truck also. ( GREAT teamwork)!! All in All, I loved everyone that worked with us, there was a few other people in between that said hi, gave us waters and really made us feel that we made the right choice, going to John Elway's Crown.

Only 2 complaints:
1. I had to wait a very long time to get the paperwork completed.  I spent over 2 hours in 2 different departments. Considering there were not many customers, that I could see, I think it should be a quicker process.  Especially, since the process had begun the day before.
2. I have to take the blame for this second complaint.  Although, Jose showed me where the spare tire was, I failed to ask about the jack and tire iron and he did not make sure to show me how to remove the tire.

496,"March 22, 2014","I was purchasing a vehicle for my daughter for a commute on the freeway to college. Doug was extremely helpful and attentive to her needs. He provided a lengthy test drive including a short freeway test. This allowed for her to gain the full experience of how the car handles in different situations. By providing this level of service, Doug ensured that we were entirely happy with the purchase we were about to make. During initial purchase, my daughter was concerned that she may not be making the right decision (she was paying half of the $10,000. We stopped the purchase and left. The following day, she decided she did want the car. Doug continued to be extremely helpful and understanding, prepared the car for her, and aided us through the purchase of the vehicle.

The price was better than we ever would have expected and CLEAN! Doug worked hard to get us the best deal possible on our trade in, and worked to make us a good deal. He was not pushy or pressured us, and it was a very pleasant buying experience. The finance manager Ruben, was great! We had a great time going through the usually painful paperwork. Not only was he just a fun guy to work with, he actually took the extra step to get us a great deal (better than our credit union) for financing. The only downside to this purchase was the length of time to complete the deal. With no haggling we still spent 3 hours at the dealership once we selected our car. I know most dealerships take around this amount of time, but would have been nicer if we could have gotten out within an hour and a half. We last purchased our Prius in 2007 from the same dealer and with the customer service Crown provides, we will continue to buy our cars here! Can't say enough good things about this experience. ",5.0

While we were there we had the pleasure of also working with Anjum Raza and Vince Foglia.  They are both very helpful and made the process quick and painless.
 I think the only thing Crown Toyota could improve on is the Finance Department.

516,"February 17, 2014","I really enjoyed my trips to John Elway Crown Toyota Scion of Ontario.  I went searching for a dependable new car that would be fuel efficient, economical, and big enough for a growing family.  I initially looked at the Corolla.  Doug showed me around that car.  I came back on a day he wasn't there, and Gina took good care of me.  Ultimately, she managed to up-sell me to a Camry when she met my new baby.  It was a great decision.  The Camry is roomy enough for all of our new baby gear.

On my third visit, I called Gina in advance and she had my vehicle lined up and ready to go.  I did my homework before I came to deal, presented a fair offer that I would be happy with, and it was essentially accepted with minimal adjustment.  We went during a very busy time this President's Day Weekend, but they had anticipated that by bringing in all their sales, management, and finance staff.  The process was as speedy as possible.  When they saw we had been waiting for a while and the baby was getting cranky, they even through in some perks!

Overall, I think this dealership is focused on customer satisfaction, which is the most important thing a dealership can set their sights on.

577,"October 25, 2013","This was the best car buying experience I have EVER had! Mike Lee was a great sales person - very patient and caring - not your typical sales person... just wanting to make the sale.  I was undecided as to which car I wanted and he took me through the entire lot, asking questions, and showing me virtually every car - just to make sure I was able to make an ""educated"" decision.  I did not feel pressured to make a decision, or pushed into a specific car just because he had a quota or needed to move a certain car.

When it came time for financing, the process was very easy - there was very little ""back and forth.""  

After all of the paperwork was completed and it was time for delivery of my new Camry, Mike asked me to look around the car to make sure there were no scratches or anything.  I've never had anyone say that, because after all, new cars should not have any scratches, right?  This car, unfortunately had a ""blemish"" (a sort of scratch or something).  Since it was after service hours, Mike asked me to come in the next day to get a work order and schedule an appointment for the ""blemish"" to be removed.

The next day I went in to pick up the work order.  Mike was not in, but had arranged to have the sales manager, Greg, take care of it for me.  Greg went to look at my car, asked me to wait in the customer lounge, then took the car back to the service department.  Not too long after, Greg came back to let me know the ""blemish"" had been removed.  He also arranged to have his Entune specialist, Isabel, come out and give me another lesson on how to synch my phone and the app.

Even after the deal was made and I was enjoying my new car, Mike called the next day to follow up, making sure I was happy with my car, and that Greg had taken care of me while he was out.  Imagine having someone call AFTER buying a car instead of hounding you before.  He already had the sale, so he didn't need to call, right?  That's the kind of guy Mike Lee is.

I appreciate the extra time and personal attention everyone gave me during my car-buying experience.  This is my first Toyota and I'm thrilled with it - even more since my experience was so great!  I will definitely recommend this dealership to friends.  And when it's time to buy my son his first car, you can be sure we will return to John Elway's Crown Toyota - and ask for Mike Lee!",5.0

I am an informed and cautious consumer, and have never liked the tactics I have experienced at other dealerships. Our salesman was informed, considerate, honest, professional and very knowledgeable. I was leery and standoffish when he first greeted us.  Michael Rios was professional, let the product sell itself and just guided us through the process.  It didn't take long for me to gain his trust and that is not something I do easily in these instances . He knows his product, the quality of  the cars he sells and the integrity of the agency he works for; all of which made me a customer for life.  Everyone I  have had the privilege of coming in contact with at Crown Toyota has shown the same courteous, no pressure service that Michael Rios gave us.

He really seemed to listen and steered us in the direction of a Sienna. We looked ant a few models and decided we liked the Sienna enough to make a purchase. It just came down to finding one that suited our needs and fell within our budget.  James took us all over the lot, into the back and even over to the Pre-owned section trying to find us just the right van.  We ended up purchasing a 2011 Sienna that had everything, and more within our price point.  James was such a blessing and we hope he will be able to represent Crown Toyota for a long time. 

Ruben was the finance manager that helped us. He also listened to our situation and I felt he did everything possible to get us a great deal.  Overall I felt I got  great van at a great price. Thank you Crown Toyota!",5.0

653,"August 01, 2013","After some previous bad experiences with buying new cars I decided to take it slow. Went to one dealership close to home just to warm up and they tryed to pressure me which wasn't very smart because I just got up and left. After that experience I decided to handle the majority of my  conversations via email. When I did receive phone calls I mostly ignored them. 
From Ontario Crown I received an acceptable detailed quote up front. This is what drew me to this dealership. Seemed like no one else wanted to put numbers on the table but rather all they wanted was to get me onto their lot. The lot at Crown had several of the vehicles I wanted so I was able to choose the color I wanted and test drive it. The salesman (Syed) was very friendly and went out of his way to help. For example I drove a rental car to the lot and after the purchase was over he offered to drive me to the rental car company to return it. He didn't have to, since I already purchased the pick-up, but he seemed like he wanted to. In the end I left with the truck I wanted and didn't have a difficult day. I actually found myself enjoying it.
One more example:
Buying a vehicle is kind of like a woman having a baby. I know it's nowhere close to the pain, as I've been told, but it is still a pain. Once the baby is out and in the mother's arms all of the pain that was just experienced doesn’t seem to compare to the joy of your new baby. So driving away in my new baby was pretty awesome. Wow! Sorry but it's late and I'm tired. That example is pretty far out there.

Needless to say I never returned to the other dealership. I drove up in my Saab with the pink slip/title, ready to do business.

I have gone to the service department for the last ten years with previous car and my positive experience there was why I purchased at Crown Toyota.  It is good to have a competing quote on trade-in in hand, to be ready to compare with trade-in offer by dealer.  I also found it useful to look up inventory and options on the Internet, along with live chat, so that selection options could be narrowed down for visit.  There are a lot of vehicles in stock, including stored outside the main lot, so sales staff will not immediately know if there is a vehicle with your exact preferences.With such a large volume of sales, it took a while to get into the finance office to finish up, but I was greated personally by the manager while waiting for my new car to be brought to the front for delivery.  The sales rep also assisted with making sure nothing had been left in my old car.  While 2013 models may get discounted even further when the 2014s arrive, the final price was right at the lowest amount expected and the trade-in was also competitive.",5.0

661,"July 29, 2013","There was a finance guy and another guy in a blue shirt who deserve good scores, but I don't remember their names.

We were down the street at the Mazda dealer & asked for the Costco rep - the salesperson stated he was the Costco rep yet he knew nothing about the program. He was supposed to be showing us the car, but continued to sit in the car, that we were supposed to be looking at, on his cellphone for about 5-10 minutes. He then explained to us it was a demanding customer who wants this & that, etc (of course I wondered what he was going to say about us). Then we started talking price/rebates/incentives & he told us we couldn't have incentives and Costco pricing or the dealership wouldn't make money, and then just got pushier asking us what it's going to take to get us into the car. At that point we walked away - which is really too bad for that guy since my husband really, really wanted the Mazda. That's when we decided to head next door to John Elway's Crown Toyota.

It was nice to go look at cars and not be hovered over. We went in, saw Justin, and asked for the Costco rep, got our Costco price, test drove, and bought the car. It was really that simple. Nobody was pushy. Nobody was giving us statistics that were making our eyes glaze over. Nobody made us sit there for an hour while they came up with a price... and that's a huge issue we've dealt with in the past when buying cars. The price of the car came out within 5 minutes, which just made everything work out better.

So far it's a great little car, and I'm very happy with the service we received. 

Of course everyone is hearing the story of how easy the transaction went, and how good the price was. This was a very good car buying experience, and I will return if I ever buy another Toyota.

After hours of back and forth I couldn't make a deal come to fruition at any of these dealers, I gave my local Toyota Dealer(John Elway) a try. I first called and spoke to a sales men and was completely turned off by the unfriendly customer service I received and had a sour taste in my mouth. At this point I had put this whole buying of a car thing on the back burner. I then decided to give the Costco Fleet service a try, since my location of my home to the dealer is so close costco referred me to John Eleway Toyota frustrated with what had happend before, I still gave them another chance. I got a call from Debbie's Team with in 30 min of the costco inquiry and I proceeded to explained to them what FJ I wanted, what price I wanted to pay, and how long I wanted this whole process to take. They simply said hold a min and 5 seconds later came back on the line and said we got a deal when can you come in. I was a bit taken back thinking they had to give more of a fight I was asking of pretty much invoice and some. To my surprise that was wrong it was just that easy they made this transaction a breeze. I proceeded to ask them via phone, how long will it take to draw up the paper work and have me out the door the girl on the phone said with in a few hrs. Around 45 min later I arrived at the dealer met Debbie and she took care of me from start to finish just shy of 3hrs(actually Timed it). I know 3hrs sounds like a long time but if you are familiar with buying a car that is almost lighting fast. I honestly think it could have been faster but this dealer was selling cars left and right so it was not that they dragged there feet its just it took that long for me to get into finance since they had so many people purchasing. All and all Debbie and her team at John Elway Did a great Job in meeting my needs getting me taken care of and all while doing all this she always had a smile on her face the whole time.

688,"June 28, 2013","After parking in the customer parking, I made my way over to meet Velky in the used car lot.  Velky had been helping me for a couple months at this point and has made it a point to make my car buying experience as spectacular as it can be.  Velky is by far the greatest saleswoman I've ever met.  She is extremely determined and was very adamant upon finding me just the right car that fit my preferences.  She was also very patient since I was currently going through a lawsuit with Ford to get rid of my current car.  After my car was declared a lemon, I was able to meet with Velky to discuss my options in buying a new used car.  She took me on numerous test drives these past few months and has always made it a point to be someone you could easily talk to.  This was by far my best experience with a car dealership ever.

My experience with those dealerships was not pleasant, I felt the salesmen were too pushing & felt forced to pursue other vehicles that did not interest me. Tamer made me & my family feel very welcome and helped me find what I was looking for, not what he thought I should get. I will gladly refer friends and family to go see Tamer if they are looking to purchase a car. Thank you Tamer for being showing us that Great Customer Service still exists.",4.8
690,"June 26, 2013","I purchased my Scion FRS on June 20, 2013. Anjum Raza, my sales representative, was absolutely courteously and honest in finding me a good price and purchase. He went above and beyond my expectations and remained interested and respectful in my intent of buying the new Scion FRS despite our inability to agree upon an appropriate price to trade in my SL 55 AMG with management. He did not even forget that I had recently graduated with my Bachelor's of Science in Nursing from Cal State Fullerton and automatically advocated for my $500 graduate rebate. He was even kind enough to allow a few of my family members to test drive the stick shift version of the Scion FRS even though my intent was to purchase the automatic Scion FRS. After purchasing my brand new Scion FRS, Anjum was all the more helpful by assisting me to sync my phone to the bluetooth system of the car. He demonstrated how to answer and end a phone call on the bluetooth system of my car and I expressed much gratitude for this since I have never had a car with a bluetooth system prior to this purchase. Because of his honesty and reliable business demeanor, I am more than content with my purchase and will definitely recommend family and friends to Mr. Anjum Raza. Thank you for your professionalism, Mr. Anjum Raza! It was a pleasure doing business with you!",5.0

697,"June 12, 2013","My husband and I visited your dealership and was greeted by Zach Wooldridge in a very warm, friendly and professional manner.  He asked us what type of vehicle we were interested in and then began to show us the models, varying in size, color, price and mileage ....we were wanting to purchase a used Toyota Tundra truck.  He explained in full detail the differences between several of the trucks we were interested in, helping us to make a better choice using the clear and precise information he was giving us.

The most impressive thing about Zach, in our opinion, is his professionalism, his calm demeaner and his determination to get his clients the best deal.  When we walked away after closing the transaction, we felt we not only purchased a vehicle, but also made a friend.  He got on a personal level with us that made us feel we had known him all our lives instead of for an hour.  

We are so happy with our truck, and, the purchasing experience with Zach is the main reason we purchased the vehicle at John Elway Crown Toyota.  He made the difference in our decision to not keep the appointment we had the next day with another dealership for the same truck.

We will come back to your dealership in the future and will always ask for Zach.

700,"June 05, 2013","I worked with Dan 7.5 years ago when I purchased my first Prius. He was refereed by someone in my neighborhood. I really liked working with him. Then, when it came purchasing for another car, I had a choice of either another Japanese company's mid size SUV, which their new engine technology has a very good rating with great fuel economy (all gas), or another Prius. I chose the latter because, 1) I rather work with Dan as a car sales, 2) I can stay with the same service department (Crown Toyota's Danny Rodriguez), and 3) Prius gas consumption has been such a treasure. Dealing with a car sales man is perhaps the most uncomfortable experiences for most people, at least for me. I have bought a dozen and half passenger vehicles in my life, Dan was the best sales man I have found to buy a car from. I was so happy to find him this time in the same dealership with the same capacity of the job, after nearly 8 years. He has what I call a very good ""bed-side manner"". He makes you so relaxed, and makes you feel like ""you are the only one"" customer he has, that's often hard to do especially young sales people. I will do business again with him.",4.8

704,"May 31, 2013","We started at another Toyota dealership on Saturday, and the service was very poor. We almost decided against car buying. On Sunday, we took a chance at John Elway's Toyota/Scion. Vitaliy Ikhrata met us outside and from the get-go he was friendly, outgoing, and positive. He really took the time to show us a variety of cars that would meet our needs. He was detailed and thorough and explained the characteristics of each car we looked at. Once we decided on the Scion, we went in to the dealership showroom which was exceptionally clean and comfortable. Vitaliy offered us beverages and even suggested we could wait in the lounge area which was actually quite pleasant.
There was not a lot of negotiating, and we didn't get that ""usual runaround"" you get at other dealerships. This was straight forward and we appreciated that. At one point, I got hungry and didn't want to make a $25,000 decision on an empty stomach so Vitaliy suggested we go grab a bite and head back when we were ready. This was so cool because we didn't feel pressured at all. He even multi-taked with 2 customers at a time and we never felt abandoned. He was like the little energizer bunny going back and forth and all the while never appeared stressed, or irritated...he just kept smiling and we felt he was really working for our benefit. Then we went into the finance department. That was smooth and easy. Alexander informed us in great detail about all aspects of our loan and even called us back on Monday when he found us an even better interest rate. This was a top notch experience and we were extremely pleased from beginning to end.",5.0

After I I walked through the front doors,I was greeted by a bundle of joy named Tamer. This guy was very polite and not to pushy.. He was also very knowledgeable about the car I was looking at and pulled it out of the parking spot so I can get a full walk around of the vehicle. 
Couple of minutes after that we were in the car driving down the street, there was no bs about having to show my license or any of that stuff. It was a quick drive around the block and I knew I found the right car for my wife. We proceeded back into the office and I told him I was still working and didn't have much time. Tamer reply after my approval I can take off and handle what I need and to call him 30 mins before I return to the dealer and he would have everything ready for me. Surprisingly when I went back everything was ready just like he said. Finally a sales rep that lives up to his word!

He asked what we were looking for and was able to show us the different vehicles that matched what we were looking for exactly. Our experiences at other dealerships had been less than exceptional, the sales representatives were either pushy or didn't listen well to what we were looking for and that was not the case here. I was able to find the vehicle I was looking for at a good price, and it did not take long. One thing I enjoyed most about both Crown Toyota and our sales representative was the friendliness. It made the experience of buying a car  much more enjoyable. Being that we were two women most dealerships tried to misinform us about their vehicles or try to sell the amenities of the car to us. Tamar understood that was not all that we were looking for and listened to the concerns we had and was able to answer all of our questions.

She wanted a Toyota Tacoma but soon realized that was going to be out of her price range of $200-$225 a month.  We were welcomed onto the lot by a greeter (sorry, don't remember her name).  Tamer then greeted us and showed her several Tacomas but we just could not fit it into our budget.  Tamer really wanted to help my daughter find a vehicle to fit her needs.  He showed her several vehicles and really showed concern for our situation.  The last vehicle he showed her was a 2008 Chevrolet Silverado.  It was perfect!!  She took it for a test drive and was hooked.  After sitting down and discussing the numbers, the vehicle was still a little out of her price range.  He talked with the finance people and finally got the payment to $235.00.  I was willing to make up the difference for her.

As I left the dealership, I was confident that I had made a good purchase because of the advertised 160 quality inspection-this was not the case.  When I got home, I found a receipt from Seidner's Collision Center tucked into between the owner's manual for nearly $3000 in repairs for damages to the bumper, door, roof, quarter panels and other areas.  I went back the next day and was given 3 options: switch to a similar used 2010 Prius, purchase an new one or pay a $500 restocking fee to cancel the contract.  I begrudgingly agreed to buy a new one as I have lost all confidence in Toyota's pre-owned program and I did not want to fork out more money to get out of the contract.  To make things worse, I still had to haggle with the salesman and finance to bring my monthly payment down to what my original payment was having to also give up the extended warranty and alarm while adding an additional year to the loan to do so.

747,"December 29, 2012","I started shopping for a Camry LE two weeks before I planned to buy.  I first went to a dealer near-by in Orange County and asked for the Internet Sales guy, and then waited for at least 5 minutes.  The salesman showed me the car and eventually gave me a price, but it was not that impressive.  He would not promise the College Rebate for my wife who graduated with an AA Degree last May.  Also he would not promise to have the color I wanted when I came back.
The next day we went to Crown Toyota where we had a great experience buying a Camry LE in June 2006.  Syed Mehdi came out to see us right away he promised a much better price, the College Rebate, and the color we wanted.
The following week I went back to the dealer in Orange County; they now gave me a much improved price in writing, but did not promise the College Rebate or color of the car.
The day before the planned purchase date one of Syed’s assistance called; he gave me a specific price from Syed that was lower than the other guys “best” price.  I came in the next day and got the exact car I wanted at the promised price and the College Rebate.
I give top marks to Syed, but the finance guy mislead me with the warrantee.  He gave us 8 years, but changed the mileage down to only 75000.  Syed was quick with a great deal, but rest of the staff took four hours to process the purchase.",4.4

765,"September 10, 2012","Syed is the best we can hope for in car sales!  I sent an email to about 15 Toyota dealers in the area over a 40 minute period last weekend.  I sent each one the same detailed summary of exactly what car, trim and package we wanted.  I even included the statement, “once we agree on price, my wife and I will be in to pick it up tonight.”  Within 20 minutes I had an email response from Syed with an excellent price (nearly matching the price I had decided to pay) and a phone call offering to personally meet us at the door when we arrived.

Syed understood what I wanted and made sure it happened.  He even threw in a couple nice surprises to make me extra happy with the deal.

I received several obvious “auto-responses” from other dealerships inviting me to call for the best deal or offering me a cheesy $500 off if I mention their email response.  A few others were paying attention and make their response personal, but they wrote the sticker price on the email.  Opps – they didn’t even want to complete for my business.  But, no problem; Syed made sure there would be no competition by giving me his best offer first.  It won him the sale in this internet age.

But, he didn’t just sell me this one car, the overall experience he created EARNED me as his customer for life.  We’re a Toyota family and because of Syed, we’re now a Crown Toyota family.

Thanks Syed and Crown Toyota!

I came across an issue since I had just passed the mileage coverage for a warranty covered part.  I spoke with the customer relations manager, Roberta Jurgensen, who promptly resolved the matter.  She expressed her appreciation for my loyalty to the dealership (I've only ever had the car serviced by Crown Toyota) and proceeded to have the part replaced.

I want to thank Roberta and her team for all of their hard work and commitment to seeing this through.  This would not have been possible without them and my family appreciates it.

On the flip side, I called Crown and a salesperson by the name of ""Pam"" answered.  I explained to Pam exactly what new car I wanted.  Pam was very nice, accommodating, and professional, however she called me before I arrived and referred me to Jason.  When I arrived, I was directed to Jason's office.  He was dressed PROFESSIONAL, demeanor was PROFESSIONAL and his facial gesture was FRIENDLY.  Immediately stood up and introducted himself and welcomed me to Crown Toyota.  He PATIENTLY allowed me to express my objectives,budget, and my situation.  My situation at the time was that I was getting my principal residence refinanced and could not have my credit checked until it funded which would be 2-3 days later.  Well Jason was UNDERSTANDING and responded that that would not be a problem and that in the meantime I could look at a few cars and prehaps find one that I like.  He didn't show any signs of prejudging.  I showed his my credit report that had been ran on me for my refinance.  My credit score is 800+.  He explained to me that my purchase would be ""0"" % financing if over 700 when he runs it.  That was truly an incentive.  Jason also explained that filming was taken place on the site and that the Avalons were across the street.

And Mr. Rogers said that if ever I had a question or wanted to check something out, to let him know.  Whenever a new neighbor moves into my block, I give them one of his cards, because he is so trustworthy and kind. He gave me the best deal for the car, and he still is right there to help.  I will never forget his kindness.

He was very knowledgeable about the cars, he informed me about the features of different cars in detail, he had given me the tour of the cars available on the lot, which was great as I had an opportunity to see every car I liked, which made it very easy to select the car, and test driving was the best part as I could get the feel of the car during the test drive which helped me to make a decision quickly. 

He had discussed in detail different payment options that I can consider before making a final decision. He had walked me through the process of filling out the documents and showing me what my payment options are. He had also advised me to get the GAP insurance, and install alarm in my car to protect it from being stolen and also in the event if I was to get into an accident and my car would get totaled I would get a replacement, which provided me piece of mind.

I purchased a 2003 Highlander from the dealership and a service contract (or extended warranty).  When I discovered a problem with the transmission, I took the vehicle to Jeff.  He correctly diagnosed the issue and worked diligently to ensure that the warranty company would cover the costs assured in the contract.  This required a great deal of his time and energies, but he persisted and succeeded in providing all the paperwork and test results that the warranty company required to pay for the replacement transmission I required, less the deductible.

824,"March 05, 2011","From the moment my husband and I stepped on the lot, John stepped out and greeted us with a smile.  We explained how we were just there to look at vehicles and were browsing several of the dealerships in the Ontario Auto Mall to become with familiar with which auto we may want to purchase in a few months when my husband received his bonus check.  We had just been to 4 lots already in the morning, and I had explained that we needed a 3rd car just to drive around in town and were looking for good gas mileage, I of course wanted something ""cute"" along with comfort and we had owned a Corolla back in the early 90's so wanted to look at them.  On the other lots once we explained we were not interested in actually purchasing for a few months, the spirit and salesmanship dwindled from our salesperson and they seemed to lose interest in even showing us any vehicles once they realized they were not making the sale today.  John however took the time to still show us what Crown Toyota had to offer, explained how it was owned by John Elway and how they took pride in the cars and service they offer.  He seemed to really enjoy his job and sharing what each car had to offer.  He showed us the Corolla, and I was interested in the Matrix so he showed us those and then we turned a corner and he said ""hey you may like the new Scion XD we have here"".  I got in this little silver car and I loved the fit.  The seat felt like it was made for me, yet I was riding high like an SUV.  John showed me how I could plug my I-pod in, how the seats in the back adjusted and could accomodate shopping by folding down the seats or tilt backward for comfort, how even for him in the back seat there was plenty of leg room and advised we should take a test drive to really know if its something we may be interested in later on.  I told my husband while John went to get the key to be prepared for a bumpy loud ride--that this thing was going to feel like a tin can, but was I fooled.  The car really surprised me for seeming so small it really wasn't.  It is sporty, a little bumpy shock wise to be expected for this type of car I think, but exactly what I was looking for.  Inexpensive, economical and ""cute"".  I asked if we could have some brochures and information and John's card, but then John said ""well maybe we should come inside and I'll just show you the specials we have going this last weekend of January and get you the brochure"".  We both looked at each other and agreed it can't hurt to see what deals they have going knowing full well we weren't prepared to buy yet but John was not giving us the hard sell, so what the heck.  The month end special included a lease option for the XD with a small down.  When John walked away to check something out my husband of course breaks our code for definitely not purchasing today and says ""you know we can do this now if you want to.  You seem to really like the car"".  We told John what we wanted our payment max to be and he came back with an offer that was just under the monthly payment and a down payment we could live with today.  We explained he sold us--that the car sold us and we were definitely interested in the car so he went to clean the car up.  Then all of us a sudden a manager came and told us the rate they worked up for us from the pamphlet we had looked at only applied to the XD Limited Release Series 3.0 car so the payment was going to be a little out of our budget.  There was the little sparkly brown 3.0 parked out front.  I had looked at it with all its great trim kit but thought it was out of our reach since the sticker price was a little higher than what we were looking for so didn't even consider it.  I went and looked at it again.  We were going to leave empty handed at this point but then the main store manager and John explained to us that if we liked the limited release car even though the sticker price was higher that the payment would actually be lower than the other one we had first chosen because of the deal that was going on.  They asked ""do we have a deal"" and of course they did.  I love my little cocoa puff and would recommend Crown Toyota/Scion to anyone.  Ask for John Villalobos!",5.0

first incident was with my prius, i told service i smell gas from my car and they checked and said nothing wrong with it. i left the dealership and almost arrived home and car stops,  towed it to dealership and found out their was a hole in gas tank... wow! they didn't see that huh? But they did fix it, for a fee. which I could of blew up because they told me nothings wrong with it. i just think they dont actually do anything their at the dealership. then with my corolla, they do regular maintenance and car gets worst after leaving the dealership. first time i had an oil change i had no oil in it because their techs are stupid. then they had it fixed then my clutch went out, after having the car for 3 months, then now my car is making lots of rattling noises. took it back and said nothing is wrong with it after waiting for 2hrs. so whatever with that i sold the car.  Now I have this lexus rx300 i bought from them and they always mess this car up. first time for oil change, they broke my exhaust so i fixed it myself because i have a welder. ok. thats not a problem. then again another oil change then another exhaust problem.... ok im getting tired of welding something that i didnt break. so i told them... what do they say? we only did an oil change... what a jack ass you are Arthur.... tell the truth did you do the oil change. nope you didnt. so whatever with that. then now i have this check engine light the last time i brought it a week ago. went on after 2 days from maintenance.  i call them and go their and they say they didnt touch anything other than doing an oil change and filter change.  by the way im an ASE Cert. master mechanic, and I manufacture car parts. This Arthur guy tells me, oh maybe they forgot to put the vacuum lines in when they changed your air filter, and i told him they didnt change the filter, he said they did change it. so i tell him to look at it. the filter is brown when its supposed to be white. hmmm thats not new, he says nothing and closes it.  also i know they didnt change the oil filter when they did the oil change,,, because i marked it with my marker, and its the same oil filter i had when i got the car, and i've asked them if they change it they say offcourse, well to make it a short story, im rebuilding the whole car myself and will no longer deal with these unprofessional mechanics and managers they have at Crown TOyota of Ontario, Ca.  poor service and no mechanical experience.
