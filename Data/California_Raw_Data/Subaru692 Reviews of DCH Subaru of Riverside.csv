24,19-Mar-20,"Called the dealership twice and spoke with the salesperson Ali before driving 90 minutes to DCH Subaru of Riverside.
My daughter wanted to buy a green 2020 Forester. Got a quote from another dealership for the identical car, but they did not have it in green. Ali assured me that although they did not have the car either, he could obtain one and have it at the dealership within hours after we went through the initial purchase process. I asked Ali twice that this was indeed the 2020 Forester Premium with the ""14 package"" upgrade, and he stated it was. I then asked him to email me this information to confirm. While we were driving to dealership he emailed me that the price quote was for the more basic ""12 package"" which he had not mentioned previously. When we got there he denied this and the sales manager (don't recall his name...in his 60's, balding, overweight) also would not honor the price. This is a dishonest car dealership and I STRONGLY suggest you buy elsewhere. Very disappointing.",1
196,17-Apr-19,They are such liars and don’t have any customer service skills! Flip a single mom off with 3 children who saw! Awful dirty place to go! ,1
652,17-Aug-17,I called to see about getting an oil change and the man on the phone was very uncooperative. I'll find a different Subaru dealer. ,1
668,26-Jun-17,"I wish I could give them zero stars. Found a car on CarGurus, called to verify the car was still there, drove 45 minutes only to be told the car was sold this morning. Really? I just talked to you! Total bait and switch. Dishonest dealer...go to another HONEST dealer",1
687,27-Mar-16,"BEWARE. Extremely hostile and confrontational management!

The story:

Set up an appointment with a young female sales associate.
Drove 2 hours in traffic from Studio City to Riverside.
She assured me over the phone that the price of $28,990 could be lowered and negotiated. Told me to come in and talk about it.

When we arrived, sales associate was friendly and courteous.
However, car was not in perfect condition.
It only had 8,000 miles, but had visible scratches, small dents, and scrapes.
Sales associate told us we could easily work on the price with the manager.

As we went on the test drive, sale associate sat in the back seat because she was ""scared"" of the WRX. I'm not sure why she's working in a dealership if she's not able to handle something as simple as this.
Regardless, it wasn't a big deal.

Here comes the good part.
As we come back into the dealer, sales associate went to get the manager to work on the price.
She is seen visibly arguing with the manager. Manager asks why he's needed at all, doesn't seem happy to be pulled over.

The next 10 minutes is the worst I've ever experienced at any dealership.
Manager was rude, dismissive, confrontational, and acted like he was trying to embarrass us. He got up in my face with raised voice, and then proceeded to insinuate that their dealership doesn't negotiate on the sticker price. 

I told him I've never heard of that before, and I've purchased many used vehicles before. Of course, he replied: ""I've bought over 20 cars before."" Demonstrating his utter belief that that somehow matter. 

As the argument got worse, customers walked off disgruntled and absolutely disgusted with the way the staff was handling business.
When I asked him if I could speak to his supervisor, he said that he was the highest boss available. Quite strange with such abysmal customer service.
The manager then yelled at us: ""Get the xxxx out of the dealership"". He later retracted his statement, and stomped off.

Finally, the actual sales manager of the dealership came over and pulled us into the office. We tried to work out a deal, but they refused to honor any price discounts.

TLDR; Sales associate says they can do better than $38,990.
Gets me to come in and make a 4 hour round-trip to Riverside.
Used cars manager is an absolute jerk. 

All three staff members gave me conflicting information regarding the price on the vehicle.

What an absolute joke of a dealership.
Ever since they were bought by DCH, this dealership is horrid.",1
690,17-Sep-14,Went there to purchase a new WRX STi and walked around for over 15 minutes. Some sales guy comes out and didn't even acknowledge I was there. I waited for two minutes and realized why am I waiting!? And left...,1
294,08-Dec-18,"I called in the service center to see if I can walk in. The representative said if I make it there by 3pm they will accept services. Driving from Corona to Riverside in traffic, I make it to DCH Riverside Service Center at 2:58. One of the servicemen comes up to my car and says he sent most of his mechanics home and some were already leaving because business was slow. I informed him I was guaranteed service and tha I drove pretty far to get there. He just said sorry and didn’t even have the decency to try to call back a serviceman if he was Stiller the center to simply get the oil change done. Unsatisfied Customer. Contacted Sales to see if they could bring it up to management. Spoke with Dan so hopefully I get some kind of voucher or incentive for the terrible experience.",1.4
394,06-Aug-18,"I recently was helping a friend negotiate a deal on a Subaru Outback Touring. Before, we were even ready to decide on the exact car we visited DCH in Riverside and dealt with David who was great and gave him the promise of he'll have first right of refusal to complete the deal since it was the ""hometown"" dealer. 

A few weeks later, we communicated via email and scheduled a day. I came to the dealer to settle the deal, so later in the day all my friend had to do was ""sign and drive"". I met with David and he took the deal to the manager and got everything settled and told him I'd be back in a few hours. We came back a few hours later and David was helping another customer on the lot but met with us, walked us to the showroom and handed us off to another salesman, Ahmed, and explained to him to get the paperwork going and that everything was settled. Poor Ahmed must have been having a bad day or maybe it was vengeance against David, but he was seriously not interested in helping us, took forever to ""find the car"" on the computer, then complained to us that the deal wasn't correct because the deal to beat on a competing car was less than the one that was on their lot. I told him multiple times that David already talked to the desk manager, the deal was done. He continued to argue with us WITHOUT going to see the manager who was the one who approved the deal. All this guy had to do was fill out the paperwork. Things continued to go south as Ahmed said this wasn't the way he does business, and K.O.'d the deal. David came walking back in a bit surprised at the turn of events, but at this point we were beyond frustrated after all having put in the effort, only to have a random salesman no this deal can't be done. Even the sales manager came out at that point to try to salvage the deal but I'm a firm believer in the principal of the matter and an agreement shouldn't be ko'd by a random salesman. David was great, and I'd highly recommend him and we would've bought a car from this dealer if his co-worker didn't kill the deal for them. Sadly, not only did my friend by a car that evening from a competing dealer, but I bought another Outback for myself just a few weeks later. Beware of Ahmed he think he's ruler of the dealership, even from a salesman position. ",1.6
691,08-Mar-13,"This dealership is joined with the local Chevy dealership.  It is very small and the service people are not focused on customer service once you buy from them.  We thought with it being as small as it is, we would get great customer service.  We were wrong and we will not recommend them.  This is unfortunate because the Subaru product is a great one!",2
141,07-Jul-19,Took my outback in on a Friday morning to have a technician check for a loud noise coming from the front of the vehicle. I was messaged later that day saying that the tech called in sick and my vehicle could not be looked at until the following Monday. This is an issue that has happened to me at least once before.,3
544,02-Dec-17,I’ve been there twice now (18k & 24k) service. Both times they offered a free car wash or vacuume service . I picked car wash both times. Both times they came up with an excuse why they couldn’t wash. Instead of vacuuming they chose to do nothing.Why even offer if your not going to do either one. Next service I think I will try Ontario Subaru. Maybe they will wash and vacuume ?,3
555,12-Nov-17,"Issue 1:  Arrived at the service location and waited in the car, as requested by a sign outside the service trailer. 10 minutes later someone finally came out after a bypasser told them we're waiting in the car.   Issue 2: Took 2.5 hrs. for oil change and multipoint inspection, when they initially said it will take 1 hr., even with an appointment.   Issue 3: It took 45 min. for Subaru shuttle to pick us up, even though we were only 10 min. away and there was no traffic and alerted them to send the shuttle as soon as possible so I can make my apointment.  Issue 4: technician didn't look at the heater issue as I requested.

33,29-Feb-20,"Others, I’m not sure but Nick is awesome in the Service Department! He was very helpful and prompt. He also followed up to make sure we are informed when the car is ready.",4
56,30-Jan-20,"Fast, courteous service, compares very favorably to past experiences at other dealers. I would have given 5 starts but on this occasion my vehicle did not get washed.",4
100,14-Nov-19,"Brian was great. 
The 1 1/2 hour wait time becoming 6 without warning was not. I wish I'd been updated on the time...I would have asked for their roundtrip shuttle. ",4
102,08-Nov-19,SAL at this dealership was awesome. Excellent service to work out a deal for my new car! Thank you for coming by all the way to garden grove to drop off my xtra key. ,4
203,10-Apr-19,"My wife and I walked into the dealership with a model in mind but unfortunately the dealership did not have the selection that desired. After being shown a few different options Christopher Wright was able to guide us into the model that was available. Although it was a higher price point than we initially wanted we are happy with the Subaru Ascent that we drove off the lot. I would however have to add that the office needs to be more customer friendly, there was little to no privacy speaking with sales people and the size and layout was just not thought out correctly. ",4
248,15-Feb-19,They did good job and being very fair.  I just brought car for oil change and tires inspection.  I waited for over two hours and half.   The car was done and no charges for me to pay.,4
515,04-Jan-18,Service was performed quickly and the advisor let me know what other work would need to be done for my next visit. Facility was easy to get to.,4
567,02-Nov-17,I truly appreciate Matt's great service in helping me get Honda Odyssey.  He took an extra mile and drove the car where I was for a test drive and extremely helpful and professional so I could get the car on the same day! I will surely come back to him.,4
571,02-Nov-17,"All the service Advisors  are good people and helpful. Subaru in riverside needs a better waiting  room & bring back the courtesy car wash.

183,09-May-19,"The haggling is a little too much but overall I got the deal I wanted good customer service great car second Subaru that we own free maintenance for 24,000 miles is great idea.",4.2
191,24-Apr-19,"Nice, knowledgeable and very friendly. The place was clean, and they offered us water and coffee. We got along really well with Matt and Ali, Matt help us looking for the right vehicle for me and my wife and end up a forester limit",4.2
386,19-Aug-18,"Good service and helpful people inside. The only bummer was not getting a spare key, other than that would recommend to my friends and family.",4.2
449,21-May-18,The dealer I went through was very helpful and thorough during my visit. I had no problem choosing a vehicle thanks to him. His knowledge and interest in the Subaru community was above average. I highly recommend him to anyone who decides to visit DCH Subaru of Riverside.,4.2
517,04-Jan-18,"Very Friendly, not pushy at all, very accommodating, made the car buying process as seamless as possible! They made me feel at ease, and I very much enjoyed this car buying experience. ",4.2
528,21-Dec-17,"Brian was great. He was very patient with my desire for multiple test drives, and very personable throughout. Very good to work with. The inevitable first meeting with the sales manager involved the usual unpleasant lowball offer on my trade and a ridiculous 3K warranty package. After some sparring there, he came down to my original offer - almost. The one thing that did annoy me was that I wasn't informed that the 0% financing offer on new Subarus had been extended into December (I was there on December 1). I might have considered a new one over the CPO I bought had that detail been brought to light. The interest I'm paying on the new CPO almost equals the difference in price I would have ultimately paid on a new comparable Forester. Amin stepped in nicely when it was found that the windshield needed to be replaced on the purchased car due to faulty mirror/EyeSight camera  placement. The others wanted me to drive the vehicle over the weekend, anyway. I basically refused and Amin was right there, saying of course I could continue to drive my own (trade-in) car until the new car was fixed three days later. That was appreciated. The young man who got me settled into the car upon pickup was very good to work with, as well. I think it might have been Nick, but not sure. Brian gave me a nice follow-up call a couple days later. So, overall - 4 stars. ",4.3
150,14-Jun-19,"After several visits and quotes from other dealers, Riverside beat all other quotes. I got my dream car at the price I wanted. David Nightingale was great! Friendly, and no pressure. Ask for him. Nice young guy, just starting out. Call for appointment to avoid seasoned salesmen. ",4.4
199,12-Apr-19,They were the only subaru dealer who gave a good price here in SoCal and worked hard to get me the vehicle and options I wanted.,4.4
277,05-Jan-19,"I'm starting out to say that if it wasn't for Richard T and Nick V for their follow-ups, I would probably not have ended up getting a car at this dealership.  Started with internet pricing and working with Nick - who was helpful and courteous. Then was contacted by multiple folks telling me to come in for a test drive and to see the Outback 3.6 that we were interested in.  We made an appointment and showed up, there were NO Outback 3.6s on the lot and none were expected to come in for another week.  Richard T went out of his way to find a like engine vehicle so we can test drive it, then found a like body style car so that we can look at the interior/exterior in detail.  Richard took the time to explain each feature for the car trim that we wanted and was apologetic in their dealerships' misinformation.  Ultimately we ""ordered"" the car and waited a week for the delivery.  We are very happy with the vehicle and with our interaction with Richard and Nick. ",4.4
304,30-Nov-18,Our sales rep was amazing. He was nice and knowledgeable. He made us feel comfortable and welcome. He went out of his way to find the car we wanted after another sells person took the car we were looking at and was rude about it. Prince was great. ,4.4
322,02-Nov-18,"The staff here are helpful, understanding, and reasonable to work with. This was my first time going to a dealership by myself; they were transparent in their prices and I really enjoyed working with them.",4.4
446,24-May-18,Nick was my sales rep. He was very knowledgeable about the car I was interested. It was a pleasure doing business with him. I will recommend him to my friends and family. ,4.4
470,04-Apr-18,"I really enjoyed working with Prince Hayes at DCH Subaru of Riverside. Although he was new to the company and did not know everything about the car, he was very helpful in getting me all the information I needed to make my decision. His attitude and personality really influenced my decision to buy a car at this particular dealership and the rest of the staff were also nice and accommodating. ",4.4
512,08-Jan-18,I'm a Nevada resident and inquired online regarding the cars availability and secured a price before I showed up. Upon arrival the car was not cleaned nor detailed. I followed through with a test drive anyway and was happy with how the car drove. After the test drive I followed through the sales process with Nick. Nick was not pushy and very willing to help facilitate the sale between myself and the sales manager. My girlfriend then found out the dealership was not going to fill the gas tank before we took our long drive back to Vegas and inquired with the Sales Manager as to why. I thought this was awkward as well but the manager explained to us that they only fill up the tank for New Car Sales only. In my mind this did not ruin the deal but it would have been a nice touch in leaving me fully satisfied with the sale (especially as the tank was half full and it would have cost $20 to fill). We then waited about 45 minutes after the deal was struck to get paperwork signed. After paperwork was signed we waited about an hour for the car to be detailed. My girlfriend and I decided to go and grab lunch while the car was being detailed and by the time we came back the car was ready to go. I jumped in and started my long trek back to Vegas only to receive a phone call 10 mins into the drive that they forgot to put on the (4) lug nuts that were missing (most likely due to the previous owner removing the wheel locks) and I would need to return so they could put them on. This was somewhat frustrating because I was in a hurry to get back to Vegas and avoid rush hour traffic and they didn't fill up the gas tank so I was wasting my own money for their mistake. Overall I was happy with the experience I feel there were a few things the dealership could improve on but at the end of the day I would recommend this dealership.,4.4
547,30-Nov-17,"We had the nicest young man as our sales rep.   Nick Valencia went out of his way to assist our every wish.  We would have liked a faster process, but, o well.......  We only had one delay, computer problems, which held up the leasing portion of the visit.  However, the leasing agent was also very nice and apologetic, eventually using another computer.   
We love our new Legacy and all its wonderful safety features, which, I predict, will be standard on all cars in the near future.",4.4
627,03-Sep-17,The quality of the service was great. The price was lower than expected. The DCH website and chat support needs to be improved. The chat support has no ability to provide status or any meaningful help. The chat support is nothing more than a text based answering machine.,4.4
634,30-Aug-17,"Lack of early bird service, no place to park prior to business opening, except on street. Other then stated, overall service was more then satisfactory. Ruben was very helpful.",4.4
681,28-Feb-17,"Nick did a great job describing the specifications of the vehicle. He was friendly, polite, and professional. He made sure the vehicle was ready, and even after closing the sale he still offered to go over all the functionality of the vehicle prior to me departing. I declined, but I greatly appreciated that he was willing to familiarize me with the vehicle even after I signed the docs. Nick has great potential.",4.4
88,08-Dec-19,"I was able to get complete information on the car I was interested in via online, corresponded with the sales representative, arranged for both paperwork and test drive at my house, reached a good agreement on price and service and completed the purchase at my home, all without visiting the dealership.  I felt comfortable with the process and the sales rep spent close to two hours with me, both on paperwork and on the test drive and orientation to the vehicle.  I""m pretty sure I got one of the best prices available in my area for this vehicle and I'm quite happy with the car.  Haven't tried the service yet, but I expect it to be good.  Had one issue with delay of completed paperwork being timely mailed to me, but I did get it after some persistent requests.  That was the only glitch and at this time I would purchase again from this dealership.",4.6
118,03-Oct-19,"I came in looking to purchase a 2019 WRX and was helped almost immediately.

Donald Smalley (Manager) was great - he gave me a price via email and honored it when I came in to buy the car.  The paperwork was done, signed and delivered in under 30 minutes - a record in my books!  Car needed to be cleaned, washed and cross bars added.

85,15-Dec-19,"I am very satisfied with my purchase, and with the way I was treated at DCH. Before going there, I did a great deal of research on the 2020 Onyx XT, contacted numerous dealerships all over SoCal and Arizona, to make sure I got the best deal. I was initially a little dubious about DCH's ""We'll beat any deal by $500!"" offer, and I was sort of irritated by all the ""salesy"" emails. But no other dealership could approach their price, and they also granted me more flexibility in payment options (credit card/check) than other places. 

When I went there to purchase the car, things started a little rocky, as my car was not there waiting for me as I expected. But Alex, my sales guy, and Sal and Mr. Edwards, sales mgr, went out of their way to make things right. This continued even after we were done, when my rental car agency messed up, costing me an extra 3-hr. drive home. Sal immediately offered to have his guys meet me halfway the next day, to save me a lot of driving. 

Alex is very knowledgeable and professional, easy to work with, and as a fellow off-road enthusiast, he gave me some great tips and advice on a few things I needed to know. Even now if I text him with a question, he responds right away. Bottom line: I got a price that several other dealerships closer to me said they couldn’t get anywhere near, DCH really worked with me to get me the vehicle I wanted, and I couldn’t be happier. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend them to anyone.

153,12-Jun-19,I had a damaged head gasket on my Forester. I had my car towed to DCH because I couldn't find anyone else qualified to do that type of work. I used to be a mechanic for a different line of car & am very particular about who touches my car. ,4.8
154,11-Jun-19,Arrived on time to my service appointment. Service Advisor Ruben Perez was friendly and courteous. The two recalls were fixed promptly as well as my oil change and I was out the door in less then two hours. ,4.8
170,22-May-19,So far its been an easy and smooth deal in which everything goes as we expect.Friendly staff and was straight to the point..no hassle.,4.8
174,20-May-19,"There were people who drove from other counties, who were sitting with me in the waiting area, just to get their car serviced with respect and honesty.  We all agreed that Chris listens to the need of the customer and provides all options without over selling.  When the bill is a large one, you feel that the work will be done correctly.  He is not taking advantage of women or people with language barriers like at other automotive shops.  Chris truly helps his customers. ",4.8
176,19-May-19,"When purchasing a new car I have always cringed when meeting a car salesman. The stereotype of an aggressive salesman trying to get you to sit down a talk numbers is surprisingly a norm. Richard on the other hand was eager to show us what we didn’t know what we wanted and even happily showed us cars in the rain. All of this was above and beyond my wife and I’s expectations. I am happy to have done business with the Riverside Subaru dealership and would recommend this dealership to anyone that was looking for a Subaru. 

Thanks again Richard! You rock!",4.8
215,26-Mar-19,"Richard Tomosada was my major contact.  He was very pleasant and easy going.  He made sure that I became familiar with the features on the car before we left the lot. I indicated the features I was looking for and he pointed out which ones were standard on the various models and which ones were optional. I bought the Forester Limited which has just the right amount of ""high-tech"" stuff without being too much.   Both he and Allen made the paperwork aspect go smoothly.  They made me feel I've become a new part of the Subaru family.",4.8
218,23-Mar-19,I had a bad experience with the Subaru Dealership in Ontario (dishonest financing employee). I decided to take by business elsewhere. I found DCH Subaru of Riverside and scheduled my first service. I had a very good experience. DCH Subaru of Riverside is now my dealer of choice to service my two Subarus. Keep up the great work!,4.8
220,22-Mar-19,This has been the third dealership I have used and hopefully the last. Ontario would steal things from my vehicle and just found out Long Beach didn’t do everything they stated on my paperwork ,4.8
238,03-Mar-19,"After several months of research and looking for a Subaru Forester, I am happy to say that I purchased and financed my car through DCH Subaru of Riverside. 
I called the night before to ensure that the car I was looking at was still available. I spoke with a man named Allen who informed me that the car was still available. He asked what time I might stop by the following day but I stated I was unsure. I did this intentionally because I did not want him to expect me at a certain time and expect a possible sale. My intentions were just to look.

The following morning I arrived at DCH Subaru of Riverside and was, oddly enough, greeted by Allen Abrantes, the same man I had spoken with on the phone the night before. I cannot say enough good things about Allen! He was a great salesman! He was honest, genuine, and real!  He did not have the typical ""salesman"" approach and made you feel so comfortable! I was very apprehensive about making such a large purchase but Allen made the process run smoothly. This dealership and Allen exceeded my expectations and past experiences at other Subaru dealerships. So happy I bought my car here!

If you are looking to buy a Subaru come to this location and ask for Allen. I can ASSURE you that he will make the process smooth, easy, and comfortable for you.",4.8
245,18-Feb-19,"My wife and I had considered several makes and models to replace the vehicle my wife had driven for the past ten years.  Our decision for a Subaru Outback was based on personal references from other owners plus the Outback's features and AWD capabilities.  
Our DCH Subaru sales representative was very patient with us, answered our questions and allowed us to take comprehensive test drives that demonstrated the car's features, particularly some of the new electronic safety systems.  We never felt pressured during the sales process.  It would have been great to have received a higher value for our trade-in, but the car had some issues.
During our purchase contract process, the sales representative described each step - with no surprises or extras that we didn't agree to.  At the end of the rainy day, we drove away in our new Outback!",4.8
254,01-Feb-19,"Courteous and helpful staff. Even delivered my vehicle to my home day after purchase. David Nightingale, Nick Valencia, Amin Noori all very helpful and informative.",4.8
259,31-Jan-19,"Took my Forester in for its 60,000 service. They were thorough, fast, and efficient. I added a couple of extra requests and those were completed as well. I was offered a loaner car at no cost but didn’t take advantage of it. When done they explained in detail everything they had worked on. I only wish they would change the TV channel occasionally. Four hours of a Netflix baking show was a bit much!",4.8
266,21-Jan-19,"We were treated courteous and without any pressure.  The sales person was helpful but did not push us in any way.  Pricing was made simple, without negotiating.  That is important to us.  Other staff was also helpful, offered assistance, and answered any questions we had.",4.8

336,03-Oct-18,"Had car in for the second semi annual service for our 2017 Outback. Ruben Perez promised car would be done in 1.5 hours and it was. In fact, it was done in less than 1 hour. This is important to us as we come from the mountains and like to get service done as quick as possible. The reason for 4 stars is we had to order a needed part and was told we would hear in a week. Have heard nothing yet.",4.8
342,28-Sep-18,"Overall happy experience. Used Costco program to purchase. Provides about a 9% discount.
All their cars have a dealer added alarm system. Just refuse it if you want . They can disconnect it.
Very polite and accommodating.",4.8
347,27-Sep-18,DCH Subaru Riverside is overall a great dealer. Be careful who you talk to as some of them aren't knowledgeable or won't listen to what you are saying. We had to request someone completely different and talk to Management in order for the process to work. The lot is small so their inventory isn't great BUT they went out of their way to transfer a car from another Subaru dealer to get us the car we wanted. The management team is fantastic and will do whatever it takes to make sure you are satisfied. Overall I'd really recommend this dealership. ,4.8
365,09-Sep-18,Customer service was great the only thing was I needed a loaner car and i had to go to enterprise 2 doors down. And I should have been put in a subaru of equality.,4.8

440,01-Jun-18,"This was my first Subaru. Our sales rep Brian was very responsive and helpful. They gave us a  great deal. Nearly all the deal was made almost completely over the phone and Internet.

Problem: we didn't realize the car had water spots over the entire exterior. Brian made it right, however. He vowed to correct the oversight by bringing us back to clear the spots. He even offered to top off our fuel. That's service, when things don't always go right.",4.8

479,15-Mar-18,"My last visit was simply a routine maintenance on our 2017 Forester, but we have bought and serviced our vehicles EXCLUSIVELY though DCH Subaru for the past few years.  Since this was a Service Experience I will just say this about Sales: No Hassell, No Pressure, TONs of options and awesome test drives! Oh..and Ahmed is the JAM!

Now Service: They have been in three different ""buildings"" since we first started going to DCH, but each one had plenty of reading material, snacks, drinks and FREE WIFI while you wait.  I have had issues with an older Impreza and the fellas in Service worked VERY hard to help me with the warranty company.  Every one of my visits is a pleasant one and I look forward to my upcoming appointment to pre-order our Ascent!

Thank you EVERYONE at DCH Subaru Riverside!",4.8

496,01-Feb-18,"Low pressure for a car dealer which I like. They offered all the add ones ( extended warranty, gap insurance and so on ) but graciously accepted my refusal. I walked out of the first dealership I went to when they wanted to argue with me about it. I may have left some money on the table by offering the “TrueCar” price instead of haggling but I got the car I wanted with no hassle. I’ve bought at least a dozen new cars from dealerships in my lifetime and this was the best experience by far. ",4.8
497,01-Feb-18,The whole experience was positive and our Sales person was great. Allen walked us through the process with ease and answered all of our questions.

When my son realized that a new Subaru was only $3000 more, James took us out to the brand new cars just taken off the truck.  It was late by this time 9pm and Don walk us thru financing fast with out any hassle.  It was late and I was ready to go home and James said to call him anytime.  I’ve called him and he was very helpful.  I’m a little upset with Subaru because I can’t use my smart phone and get verbalize direction and I cannot add Navigation to my phone after the fact. I wish l was told this earlier!",4.8

We especially appreciate the friendly, personal service of the service team.  Reminders about upcoming servicing requirements and regular special offers that reduce costs are extra plusses.  The only downside to the current dealership is that the new service department building is still under construction, so the waiting area for servicing (in a temporary trailer) is a little dark and cramped compared to the old area.",4.8

689,21-Nov-14,"I knew that I wanted a new XV Crossteck. I had been reading and looking at reviews for quite some time before going to test drive one. When I let my wife know, she contacted Gordon via email. We went to Singh Subaru to meet him and test drive an XV. We asked for Gordon and were greeted warmly by him. I wanted to test drive a five speed as I have had CVT transmissions in other makes of cars in the past. They only had CVT cars on the lot. I let Gordon know that color was a must(it HAD to be orange)and that I wanted a five speed, but was willing to test drive a CVT because of the manual mode. Gordon DID locate a orange five speed...... In Arizona. It was the ONLY five speed in the western US. However I would have to pay to get it here. Well I was impressed with Subarus CVT, both in auto and manual mode. We went home. I had to work and could not get back to the dealer for a few days. My Wife and Gordon came to an agreeable price for the car we test drove over the phone, however, she had to work the next day as I did. I was on night shift, so I would have to get a ride to the dealer to sign papers and take delivery. Gordon CAME TO MY HOUSE and picked me up the following day.

Drove over an hour to look at a used 2018 Forester I saw online and was expecting to get the runaround because I wanted to have my payments the same or lower for a 2019 trade-in (with a sizable amount I still owed on it). Adrian Melendez and the team there worked their magic and got me exactly what I asked for. Took a bit of back and forth but it was worth it, I could not have been happier with the outcome and got exactly what I wanted. Not to generalize, but as a woman, going into a dealership is a little intimidating because you expect to get a bad deal or be talked down to.

129,06-Sep-19,"My wife and I love our Subaru. It's a 2018 STI that we modified to be exactly the way we wanted it. I recently took it in for its 30,000 mile service. While dropping it off, the staff greeted me by name. I gave my service writer a list of things that were specific to our car: I brought my own oil. The wheel key is on the front seat. Do not touch this car with air tools...

What impressed me most was that they all understood what this car means to us and made it a point to say: ""We'll take care of you."" That sentiment was expressed by everyone I spoke to during this process - including the drivers that took me to my office and picked me up later in the day.

On the trip back to DCH, I asked my driver about the service technicians specifically. He knew them all by name and described their expertise in detail. He then said: ""You brought that dark gray STI, right?"" - I said yes and he went on about the car and what everyone was saying about it during service.

That's the kind of experience I get whenever I bring our car to DCH. It makes them easy to recommend.",5

We had a 2014 Forester that has been great  and DHC found us exactly what we were looking for, at an excellent price, They were pleasant and easy to deal with. We even left to compare the deal with a different make and model that was our alternate choice. We rapidly saw that the Forester was much better for us and called to say we were on our way to buy the car we wanted. They even found us a better interest rate. We were very pleased with our first experience at DHC and will use their other services (repair, parts etc) in the future.",5
144,28-Jun-19,"When it came time to turn in my 2016 Outback, I decided to lease a new Crosstrek.  I went online and decided exactly what model and extras I wanted and sent out emails to around 12 dealers here in Southern California and in northern California.  Milthon Rodriguez gave me the best price for the new Crosstrek Ltd. lease and ordered it for me.  Alejandro Echeverria did the final exchange and answered all questions.  Both were very professional and very pleasant to work with.   I have also been to DCH Subaru of Riverside for service and again,  everyone was great!     Three years from now I will once again send out emails to a variety of Subaru agencies in California searching for the best price for whatever car I decide I want, but I bet that DCH Subaru of Riverside will be the 3rd time winner!

Allen Abrantes the person in charge of helping me buy the car informed me that the color I want was in transit and would arrive on a later date. Therefore he helped me reserve the car with a deposit that would later apply deposit to my down payment. Allen helped get me the car I wanted for the best price possible. His efforts were beyond and his customer service really made me feel appreciated and looked after. On 5/27/2019 I went to Suburu to do paper work and pick up the car. Since I made the deposit prior the process took only about an hour and a half. I cannot extend my gratitude enough for the excellent service, beautiful car, and overall experience at DCH Riverside.

We were greeted by a young man named Prince who took us on a tour of the lot. He was very friendly and informative. My wife and I both felt very comfortable with him. We eventually came across a 2019 Outback. For me, it was love at first sight. At that point, I knew I was going to be buying not just looking. Prince was extremely helpful. He answered all of our questions and even streamed the NCAA basketball game on his phone when I mentioned I wanted to see the games today.

214,26-Mar-19,"Hi there,
I had the pleasure of working with Allen. I was searching around online for Subaru dealerships ( the one closest to my home is notorious for bad customer service). I submitted interest on the DCH website and was originally looking at an outback. I am incredibly budget oriented and needed to make sure I wouldn't be wasting my time driving a hour to look at cars with the specs i wanted that were out of my price line. Allen was SO phenomenal and patient to work with. I asked him multiple questions, had him write up multiple different cars to compare prices and how the bottom line would look with my lease trade in. . . and he did so happily. He was a pleasure to work with and I cant wait to recommend my friends his way. ",5

Lets not forget the mechanics who keep my Forester running at its best, and address my concerns in a timely fashion. The DCH Service team is honest, reliable, hardworking and professional. ",5

224,13-Mar-19,"The staff at this dealership treat their customers like family and this is the type of white glove treatment you usually find at a much more upscale car brand. It was super easy to purchase a vehicle here and every member of the staff has is very respectful and has excellent clear communication. I'd highly recommend working with David N. in sales (more on that in a second) however would also like to give a shoutout to TJ and Don in F&I for making sure I was completely taken care of. 

I was trying to do most of the work in buying a car over the phone and didn't want to spend all day in a dealership. The other 4 Subaru dealerships in the area that I called basically treated me like I wasn't serious and wouldn't really talk talk to me unless I came in, also one tried to scam me.


  I am so thankful that I eventually found Dave N. here who treated me super seriously and was also extremely friendly and professional from our first conversation, he did 99% of the work over the phone like I was looking for and also David who is also extremely knowledgeable about automotive everything then drove to my house which is 40 min away to pick me up so l could check out and test drive the car and I wouldn't need to pay to take a Uber to the dealership because my parked car had been hit on the street and I didn't currently have a vehicle which was why I reason was in the market. 

This was by far the best car buying experience I've ever had and I've probably owned like 20 different cars by now. If you are in the market I would 100% recommend you contact David N. here and seeing how he can help you out because he will absolutely go above and beyond in order to earn your business.",5

The first dealership we visited never got back to us with pricing, as they had promised. The second dealership used high-pressure tactics and basically lied to us with regards to their pricing. We actually called DCH Subaru of Riverside from the parking lot of the second dealership and spoke with Matt Kraft. He was EXCEPTIONAL! After a few quick questions, he quoted a price that met with our budget over the phone, down to the penny! We immediately drove to Riverside, where we met with Matt, who was personable, honest, and provided us with a ZERO PRESSURE experience. There were no typical auto salesman antics to drive the price up, like we had experienced at other dealerships. We have bought many cars in the past, and this was by far the best car buying experience we have ever had.....period! Even though Riverside was quite a distance from our home, it was well worth the drive! Matt Kraft and DCH Subaru of Riverside have all of our business, moving forward.",5

I looked for Daniel but he was assisting somebody else so he referred me to Richard. Richard showed me the car and went to for a test drive. I loved it. He did the paperwork going back and forth as I can't decide what extended warranty should I get. Richard was very patient and helpful with me.

Our local dealer provided offers after renegotiation that did not compare to DCH and the lack of hype inspired confidence in the deal we were getting. Even though the dealership quoted a financing percentage, they went the extra mile to shop other banks and were able to drop the percentage over a 1/2 percentage point. Consequently, we traveled the additional 50 miles to Riverside to purchase the vehicle and were not disappointed.",5

However, this review is not about the vehicle, but it’s about the sale rep that helped us. Ahmed Ali knowledges of the vehicle was the main factor that helped us purchased our first Subaru. Ali took time to demonstrate or to explain all the features that come with the vehicle. He even opened the hood and showed us the difference between Subaru vs. others manufacturers. Ali professionalisms and friendliness made our purchase with Subaru of Riverside a pleasant experience. ",5
303,30-Nov-18,"I thought purchasing a new car was going to be a stressful experience. However, Ali Ahmed made the experience pleasant. He was informative, he made sure I was able to do a side-by-side comparison between the two cars that were on my list, gave me a breakdown on pricing and made sure that I felt comfortable driving my Subaru before I signed any documents. Thanks, Ali! ",5
305,29-Nov-18,Stopped here to test drive 2019 Foresters and Outbacks.  Daniel was very helpful and knowledgeable about both cars.  Overall learned a lot and helped us with our decision.,5

310,22-Nov-18,"I took our Subaru Outback in to the repair shop due to a leaking exhaust pipe.  Our customer service rep was excellent, went above and beyond duty to investigate why we would be having such a strange problem, and found that there was a soon-to-be recall on the exhaust pipe, making it repairable under warranty!  Marissa Rogers and her team repaired it and made it easy for us to pick it up a day later than it was ready, as we couldn't easily get down the 91 fwy on a Friday afternoon.  They well deserved the See's chocolates I brought them!  Thank you Marissa and team! ",5

312,21-Nov-18,"Daniel made our experience in the purchase of the Outback very easy.  He was caring and listened to what we wanted.   We test drove the car as he explained what the benefits and safety points of the car. The agency did not have the color that we wanted. After Amin and Daniel heard what we wanted they were able to accommodate our wants by the next day. Both were very caring.  They were not pushy, no pressure, and very professional.",5
313,21-Nov-18,"Not a first time car buyer and always dread the process of discussing a good and fair price for the car. That is the most stressful part for me but the process was simple, quick, and MOST importantly I knew I could trust the employees and dealership. Highly recommend Allen Abrantes at Riverside Subaru. He went out of his way to get me the EXACT car I wanted and the timing couldn’t have been any better. I am so happy with my purchase. This is my first Subaru car and definitely not my last! My boyfriend also bought his Outback through this dealership and had such a good experience. I went to other Subaru dealerships in the area and was the most impressed with this facility by far! ",5
314,21-Nov-18,"I purchased my 2019 Forester from Allen at DCH Subaru. I looked everywhere for the dark grey color and could not find it anywhere. Allen was able to find the vehicle out in Glendale and committed to driving out to retrieve it on a Friday afternoon despite all the LA traffic! Once we got back to the dealership, it was the smoothest car purchase with no high-pressure sales tactics. We were in and out in just over an hour it felt like. Would recommend Allen and DCH Subaru to anyone looking for a new car!",5
315,21-Nov-18,"This is my second purchase from DCH Subaru. Low-stress, easy experience both times. We left with our dream car. Will definitely use them again in the future. ",5

318,04-Nov-18,"It was a great experience as far as car shopping goes.  No one was pushy.  Every one was polite, did their work effectively and didn't waste time with needles small talk or b.s. I'd absolutely recommend them to others and will keep them in contacts for when my wife and daughters need their next cars.",5
319,03-Nov-18,"Live closer to the San Bernardino Subaru so I’ve been taking my car there since I brought it. Been having issues with tires and battery, they haven’t been thorough so I’ve had to come back but I decided it was enough. So it’s my first time going to Riverside and they got me a new battery because they found a leak! Can’t believe SB let me go thinking it was ok, will be coming back here for my services!",5
320,03-Nov-18,"Our Subaru Outback is now 3 years old.  We have taken it to DCH Subaru in Riverside for all recommended maintenance and service.  The DCH staff are the best.  They know us and our car, and treat us like family.  Amin Noori originally submitted the order for our car, and kept us posted as it was being built and delivered.  The purchase of our car was truly a pleasant experience.  Ruben Perez has been the primary coordinator for our service visits since.  His familiarity with our car, his  attention to each needed service, and his pleasant style of communication combine to give us a feeling of confidence that each time we visit DCH, our car will be in good hands.   Our interactions with other DCH staff has also been consistently positive.   It seems to us that DCH hires the best talent, provides the needed training, and keeps its employees for the long haul.  In our view,  DCH Subaru is a 5-star operation! ",5

Brian Kaminskas was professional, responsive to inquiries and honest. Both managers were nice too and none of the pressure tactics. The dealership is a bit out of my way, but worth the drive for me. Overall, I highly recommend this dealership",5
327,24-Oct-18,A pleasant car buying experience.  There's no pressure selling going on here!  Most of process was even done through email/text before we even went to the dealership.  While at the dealership it was a  quick and easy process.  Friendly service from everyone we met.  Would highly recommenced this dealership!,5

343,27-Sep-18,"Would like to thank Marrissa for her help in completing my service. My only complaint is she said it would be about an hour. She went to lunch. Ruben and Sabrina were at the desk. After an hour went buy I asked Ruben for an update, he said it would be another fifteen minutes. After two hours went buy I turned to the front desk, nobody was there. A moment or so later I saw my car sitting in the parking lot. Marrissa came back with my paper work. She was surprised it took 2 hours. This is not a complaint just an observation. This is my second service with Marrissa’s help. And again I want to thank her for her great service!",5
344,27-Sep-18,Was looking to buy a used Subaru and didn’t find one on other lots so went to riverside lot. Was greeted by Brian Kaminskas and started looking around the lot. Brian suggested a lease program and found a 2019 Impreza for us and worked to get the monthly payment to where we could afford. I would highly recommend this dealership. ,5

346,27-Sep-18,"Brian was extremely helpful in finding the right vehicle and had no problems ordering exactly what we wanted.  Drove a little further than we anticipated but worth it.  Great dealership, awesome salesman",5

Thank you!!! ",5
349,23-Sep-18,I feel that a 5 star is deserved because Richard tomosada was very attentive and helpful. Any questions I had he had no problems answering.,5
350,23-Sep-18,"This was the fastest and easiest car buying process I’ve dealt with at a dealer. They prepped most of the lengthy paperwork prior to me even arriving. Knowing the exact car that I wanted, I was in and out in an hour. 

Unfortunately the car I purchased had some pretty bad hard water spotting on the glass and paint which they promised they would have removed at a time that was convenient for me. If left too long, hard water spots can be a real pain to remove. When it comes to the paint, I am usually very leery of dealerships as most of my experiences generally resulted in things being made worse. When I brought the car back to them they offered to give me a full detail for free. As someone who has worked in the detailing industry I was genuinely surprised at how well it came out. This is probably the first car dealership I’ve ever actually been truly satisfied with. ",5
351,23-Sep-18,"Great prices, great customer service! From the moment you get there until you leave with your new/used car everything was smooth!  Thank you for your service! I highly recommend DCH! ",5

We came there just to check on a car, but we decided to purchased it at the time!
Reasonable pricing!",5
355,20-Sep-18,"On my way home from my one year service appointment, I had a minor hit and run, an elderly man backed into me and drove off. The front bumper of my Outback had a minor scratch. It wasn't much, but I was so disappointed that my new car had been scratched. DCH gave me a small tube of touch-up paint and suggested I go to Hamblins Body, Paint, and Frameshop across the street, where I was advised how to apply the paint... all for free. Thank you ! I will continue to drive the distance to get my car service at DCH Subaru.",5
356,19-Sep-18,"Worth the drive,  On my way to Riverside I passed two Subaru dealers. Ruben Perez is the reason. Honesty and great service is very important to me.",5

364,10-Sep-18,"I ordered the crosstrek July 11th and picked it up September 8th, the car was delivered on the 7th. Allen updated me along the way and made the proccess very easy.

He advised I have it repaired as soon as possible as the crack might interfere with my EyeSight safety system. When I mentioned this to Chris as he prepared my paperwork he advised my to first contact my insurance carrier to see if the glass was covered. I called and was elated to find out the $1,400 expense of replacing my wind shield was covered 100%! The team at DCH Subaru in Riverside has my vote for exceptional customer service. They keep my 2015 Outback running smoothly to keep my family safe.  Thank you!",5

They actually suggest ways to decrease unnecessary costs.  Most service centers at other dealerships try “sales calls” as you already got you.   Chris Chavez, the gentleman who helped me, should be considered for a promotion.  This dearship is furtunate to have him working there.  ",5

We only had one issue and that was water spots on the windshield from a rushed wash job before taking receipt of our car. After a long road trip in the car and a trip to a car wash the spots were still there, so we arranged for DCH to detail the car. They did it for free and it looks great! ",5

442,27-May-18,"My wife and I were internet shopping for a lease on several different makes and models of vehicles, including the 2018 Subaru Outback 3.6R. 

While we were waiting to receive quotes, we visited four different dealerships near our home to look at the vehicles of interest: Dodge Dakota, Chevy Traverse, Mazda CX-9 and Subaru Outback. 

When we arrived at DCH Subaru, we met Client Advisor Ali Ahmed. He was kind, patient, no-pressure and very knowledgeable about Subarus. Conversely, the people at the other dealerships were not as pleasant.

I returned to test drive the Outback, and once again Ali was kind, patient, so--stress and knowledgeable as we drove the car.

The quote that Ali emailed us was a great deal, better than every other Subaru proposal we saw, and comparatively speaking, a significantly better deal than we saw from the other brands. He also made sure to be available to us on his days-off, and was very responsive when we had to reach him during that time.

When we returned to complete some initial paperwork, Ali's manager offered us even better terms on a similar vehicle that they has in-stock (just a different color than we wanted). That is the car we took home!

We had great interactions with Ali Ahmed and Donald Smalley.

We are very pleased with our experience and with our deal!

I placed a quick call to the DCH Subaru of Riverside Service department expecting to hear ""we'll get to it when we can,"" but instead Ruben told me ""don't worry, bring it in right in, We'll be expecting you"" and that's exactly how it went down.  From the moment I arrived every member of the staff gave me a VIP reception…   my Subie was escorted back and I was informed that arrangements were made to have a rental car waiting for me at no cost.  Their staff kept in constant contact with multiple updates in the coming days and also dealt with my ext. warranty company (never a fun thing to do).  When I learned that my repairs weren't covered, the DCH staff went out of their way to accommodate my needs while providing exceptional service all the while seeking the best mechanical and financial solutions making the entire repair as painless as possible.  That ""Family"" type service is exactly why I will be returning again and again.  Thank you DCH Subaru of Riverside and Thank you Ruben, you're awesome!",5
575,27-Oct-17,"I usually hate dealing for a new car.  This was a very good and efficient business deal. There was no high pressure sales.  We were treated with respect and a very good agreement was arrived at.  We were made comfortable and were accomadated for anything we ask for.  Most important, we felt we were given the truth.  We are very happy with the car, the personnel , and future followup plans.

576,27-Oct-17,"Steven and Donald were very pleasant to work with.  Every aspect of the transaction was up-front and clear, Steven was very patient in showing me several cars and both the Forester and Outback, and he was very knowledgable about the Subaru brand and models.  We have very similar driving needs (neighbors on the mountain), so he knew what I was looking for in a car.  I compared several dealerships on-line and chose to visit DCH first since they had the best quote and the car with exactly the optionsI was considering.  The deal I ended up with was even better than the on-line quote, without any haggling.  Donald was also a pleasure to work with, he was very friendly and processed the paperwork very quickly.  Follow-up has also been very good, calling me to see if I have any questions or if I need anything.  I highly recommend this dealership to my friends and neighbors.",5
577,27-Oct-17,Thank you Chris for always taking great care of me !! When walking into the service department  I am always greeted warmly. Both of the service advisors are very kinda and seem to go out of their way to help.,5
578,26-Oct-17,"I went to the dealership because they had the car I wanted in stock.  They were very low pressure, and honest.  I especially appreciate the kindness my salesman, Ali Ahmed showed me.  He knows a lot about cars,  Thank you, Ali.  I got the price I was looking for.  Incidentally, Subarus are almost cult-like cars, because they are ultra cool.  Mine is no exception.  ",5

591,07-Oct-17,Was helped by Ruben and was taken care of from the beginning. Great customer service skills. Was in an out with no hassle. I've been to 4 Subaru dealers because I'm always everywhere. This dealer was closer to me and the service was amazing! First time Subaru owner and they are surprising me in many ways. I'm heavily considering buying another Subaru in the future and this is the reason why.,5
592,05-Oct-17,I went in for my first oil change after purchasing a 2017 wrx sti limited from DCH in April. Service was fnished in a timely manner. Great communication!,5
593,04-Oct-17,"Right off the bat, one can tell that the dealers at DCH Subaru were very interested in helping make a good decision on buying a car. I worked specifically with Matt and James, and they were both very nice and very up front with everything. Matt knows so much about Subarus, and he made sure that I was getting the best car for me. He specifically said that he wanted to help me be 100% confident in my purchase. James was super helpful too. He was really laid back and approachable. Both of them were instrumental in helping me choose the right car. I would definitely recommend this dealership to others.",5
594,04-Oct-17,"This was our (my wife & me) second time to buy a car at DCH Subaru of Riverside and both times we have dealt with Allen Abrantes as our salesperson. Having dealt with Mr. Abrantes on our previous purchase, we specifically ask for him this time. Mr. Abrantes is and was the most outstanding vehicle salesperson we have ever dealt with. He was professional, courteous, and very well informed. All of the staff at this facility were also outstanding. This included both the sales manager as well as the service department personnel we have dealt with over the last several years. On a scale of one to 10 with 10 being the highest, we would rate Subaru of Riverside as a 10+.",5

604,21-Sep-17,the staff is friendly and helpful.  They were accurate in the estimate of time my service would take.  They do their best to make you feel comfortable in the waiting. area.  They reviewed all the findings with me,5
606,20-Sep-17,"Everyone was helpful and polite. They gave me an accurate assesment of the amount of time I needed to wait. Daniel (the salesman of whom I bought  the car) gave me a refresher course on how to use my voice activated commands. Although I purchased the car a year ago, he treats me with the same courtesy as when I was about to buy the car!  He is a genuine person, and one if the main reasons why I come here for service instead of Ontario which is closer.",5
607,19-Sep-17,"Very happy with DCH Subaru.  Bought my first Subi which was a manual transmission there and loved it.  Unfortunately due to a slip and fall accident I was in a lot of pain shifting and had to buy an automatic.  I love my new 2017 Subi Forrester.  It will be with me a long time.  People ate DCH have treated me very well, I will continue to send people to them.",5
608,17-Sep-17,"I originally ordered a new BRZ through DCH Subaru. Matt Kraft was the salesperson that helped me. I found a similar but better car at a different dealer. Matt was able to transfer the car to the Riverside dealership despite the order I made. Never once did he blink. Everyone at the dealership made the process go extra smooth, even Don the finance manager (and who likes dealing with finance managers when buying a car?). Unlike every other dealership I visited, Matt knows his product extremely well, is super helpful, no pressure and is a nice guy to boot. I would recommend Matt and this dealer to anyone serious about buying a Subaru.",5
609,17-Sep-17,"The service department at DCH Subaru was very helpful on my last visit. They helped me prioritize services and told me what type of repairs might be needed next time I come in. Thanks to Chris, I always feel in great hands. ",5

612,15-Sep-17,My 2017 Subaru Forester was only a few miles away from needing my next oil change.  I had an unexpected emergency come up and needed to leave town.  With only a day notice I called and spoke with Ruben at Riverside Subaru.  He worked me in to get my oil changed the next morning so I would be able to leave town.  They were wonderful!  I truly appreciate Ruben and the team!,5
614,14-Sep-17,Iam new to mother hood and I mother experience was relaxing. Because thue took care of everything. Came back with my car and felt more safe then when I came in .,5
615,13-Sep-17,Made an appointment and had a Costco referral.  Was going to buy Forester but changed our mind and bought the Outback.  Fantastic car.  Traded in our Subaru Impreza and got a fair price.  The only complaint I have is that the car was not detailed.  Was given a full tank of gas though.,5

618,09-Sep-17,"I've only been here for scheduled maintenance and haven't had a need for work outside of that but it has been a pleasant experience every time. The dealership could use more amenities to make the wait more comfortable like other dealerships but I understand it's still under construction so hopefully the end product is something worth the wait. I do recomment this dealership though, not a bad experience yet. ",5
619,09-Sep-17,"I just purchased a new 2018 Crosstrek from DCH Riverside. I found this dealership different from their competition. The customer service, and professional demeanor stood out. I was extremely nervous going in to negotiate a car and found the process painless and ethical.  Allen Abrantes is a professional and helped me create the car I wanted instead of what the dealership wanted to sell. ",5
620,09-Sep-17,Excellent customer service and honest service staff. I've been here twice for service and have been extremely pleased with my experience both times. I will keep taking my vehicle here for service - very happy!,5
621,07-Sep-17,Thank you guys.  Always attentive very helpful. I drive a ton and am in there for service frequently. Fast friendly and affordable . Definitely buying another Subaru from this place ,5
622,06-Sep-17,"It was my second service visit to the Riverside Subaru, and they surprises me again: they did not charge me a penny, even though both times they spent more than an hour on my car. Very kind indeed!",5
623,05-Sep-17,I had an issue with my Outback and they took the time to thoroughly check out my concerns and make sure everything was working properly. ,5
625,03-Sep-17,Allen was amazing and he really made the buying experience easy and quick. I would really recommend Allen to anybody that is interested in Subaru.,5
626,03-Sep-17,"Basically went to two other local dealerships and had about given up when i called over the the DCH Subaru of Riverside and spoke to a Matt ...who promised he would find that perfect car for me..that the other 2 Subaru dealerships didnt take any initiative to go above and beyond.

I had looked up the inventory on the web site and then called to actually verify they were actually there on site and was told to come in, they were all there.  I had a list of 7...when i got there...only 1 was there and they apologized saying the web sites doesnt update accurately...EXCEpt that i had actually called to verify before wasting a trip 45 min away to see the available cars.  

 I then called Matt at a different Subaru dealership (located further from my home but seems to want my business) to catch him on his cell phone and on his day off from work.  Regardless, he still took my call and assured me if i Came in ..they would meet my needs or find me a car that would.  I asked if they just had the car i was looking for in 4 cylinder to do a test drive and then would go online and build one as i was beyond frustrated.  He said to please come in and see one of his associates, Brian-since it was his day off but that he would take just as good of care of me.

I did go in and was showed the car type i wanted to test drive and did that.  Loved it, but then Brian decided to bring me a few others to check out that met the needs I had told him i wanted in my next car.  Basically, Brian determined what I was looking for, and then balancing that with the variables i was adding to the deal with a trade in and coming in with my own financing.  

I am happy to say that the entire team did there worked with me to make the deal work and in the payment range I would be comfortable with.  I cant remember everyones names but Brian and Matt team worked it brilliantly.  The finance guy, Donald? another great asset.  Brian even took the time to introduce me to the  service staff and manager and explained how to get service in future when/if needed.

IF you are in the market for a SUBARU,, go to DCH Subaru oF Riverside FIRST for the best possible experience.",5
629,01-Sep-17,We were treated promptly and professionally by everyone. This was our second purchase at this dealership and we look forward to doing all of our service with them.,5
631,30-Aug-17,"I have been coming to DCH Riverside for years, and have recommended them to friends who bought a Subaru from them and had as great an experience as I always do. Whether it be dealing with people buying a new car, or dealing with the service department. I have always had great service.",5
632,30-Aug-17,"I called Subaru of Riverside to schedule the 60k major service on my Subaru Forester, and they were able to schedule me for an appointment the next day. I had called local Subaru dealerships to ask for prices, and Subaru of Riverside was by far the lowest. They even accepted a coupon from a different dealership and priced matched it! I was told the service would take about 3 hours so I asked for a loaner vehicle. They didn't have any available, so the staff made arrangements to give me a rental car at no additional charge. I had an overall great experience, and felt that the staff genuinely tries to provide the best customer service. I would definitely recommend taking your car there for service! ",5
633,30-Aug-17,The service is pretty awesome and good. I enjoyed being there hanging out with them. They take care of my car and also brought me back to my house.,5
635,28-Aug-17,"Great, keep up the awesome work.  Very attentive, timely, and respectful of customer's needs.  Great listeners, and I was happy to do business with them.",5
636,26-Aug-17,"First, I LOVE my Subaru!  We pushed one too many buttons & ""silenced"" my car.  Funny at first, then a bit unnerving.  I booked service on-line & accidentally booked for the next day - no problem.  The service guys worked my vehicle in (routine service) AND they un-muted my car without making disparaging remarks.  I couldn't be happier!",5
637,26-Aug-17,"I had my car at another dealer for a recall last year.  My son had paid for a complete detail for my birthday 2 days before.  They had my car 1 week and didn't even wash it.  I was pretty sad for I expected better.

The Riverside, CA dealership is very conscious of my time, expense and comfort.  They found a way to make my repairs done quickly and to my satisfaction.

As I left Service Adviser Ruben Perez held out his hand to shake mine giving me a warm thank you for bringing the car to their dealership.  He truly touched me in an age the customer usually thanks the business for doing their job,  Guess we don't really expect that anymore.  How sad for us.  You guys are ABOVE THE BAR.  Happy 1st time owner of a Subaru. ",5
638,25-Aug-17,The entire team did a great job listening to what I was looking for and I ended up with a great car that I love!,5
640,24-Aug-17,I loved the customer service and how Daniel was able to get me the STI that I wanted from the beginning. I went to two dealerships before I went to DCH and neither of those were as helpful and as professional as the staff at DCH Subaru. Thank you once again Daniel and the rest of the DCH Staff !,5
642,23-Aug-17,"Daniel was great to work with. Genuinely a nice person to deal with. The process took a bit longer than we expected but not due to Daniel, one of their computers broke down and we had to wait a while before the paperwork got printed out. Im very happy with my purchase!  Thanks Daniel!",5
643,22-Aug-17,My visit with DCH Subaru of riverside was pain free and easy going. The dealers and financing worked very well in trying to help us get the best price on our new car! Trustworthy. ,5
644,21-Aug-17,Daniel did a great job selling us a car. He was not pushy just a lot of fun. We waited a long time to buy a new car and are very happy driving our 2017 Subaru Outback. Just drove 1800 miles to and from Oregon and was a very smooth ride,5
645,21-Aug-17,"Nice chaps. Easy going and accommodating. They worked with my ever changing schedule. It will be nice to have them figure out a permanent solution to the service facilities. Seems like it is taking a long time. (Oh, and Subarus rock)",5
646,21-Aug-17,"I've been waiting for the 2018 Crosstrek 2.0i Limited for quite a while, and have inquired with various SoCal Subaru dealerships through a 5 month period. I was on a very short timeline as I plan on moving out-of-state, and needed a dealership to provide me the 2018 model both immediately and at a reasonable price. After presenting to Matt at least one of the price quotes I had previously been offered, he was quick to point out that while other dealerships were offering me great (i.e. cheaper) prices, he instead was offering me a better deal. Moreover, the vehicle was available at DCH Riverside much sooner than at the other Subaru dealerships I had inquired with. Matt, as well as Daniel and Amin, were all very understanding of my immediate need for the car, and worked to make sure the entire reservation/purchasing process was both efficient and easy. I couldn't have asked for better customer service.",5
647,21-Aug-17,Everything went well for oil  change the Lugnuts broke on them while rotating the tires the wait was about two hours  otherwise everything went very well and I would recommend them to someone else  thank you Subaru   They also provided service for us to go to lunch and they picked us up which was very nice of them thank you Ruben see you in the next oil change  mr. Hernandez ,5
648,21-Aug-17,I had been researching cars for 2 months and knew exactly what I wanted.  I had called and visited two closer dealerships but they wanted to sell me on something else.  When I called Matt from DCH Subaru in Riverside he understood I knew what I wanted and spent 2 days finding the car - even from another dealership.  He made the arrangements to bring my exact car to his store and I drove away in my dream car the very next day. Good Job to all the staff at DCH Subaru of Riverside,5
649,20-Aug-17,"I have been using the dealership where I bought my car for the services I paid for in advance and was happy with them about half the time. The last time I attempted to get an appointment, they were going to call me back on 3 occasions and never did. I reached out to DCH Subaru of Riverside and they fit me in for the next day since I was leaving the following weekend for a trip. Ruben let me know what they were doing, how much the estimate was and when I could anticipate having my car back. My car was finished within 10 minutes of the time I was told, at the price I was told. The only negative I would say would be there were not enough chairs for all those who were waiting. I will use Ruben as well as this dealership again.",5
650,18-Aug-17,Ruben in Service and Jesus in Parts were a great help. They shared their expertise and expedited my service request as promised. They were transparent throughout the whole process and communicated well with their procedures and prices.,5
651,17-Aug-17,"Arrived early, No problem, they would fit us in early. Ask for directions to a Denny's or breakfast place walking distance, no worries they say, we will drop you off and pick you up. They dropped us off for breakfast and picked us up. And car was ready! I yr service plus car wash! Excellent!!! This is why we drive 65 miles, they sell cars with same style, best experience we've ever had. We're retired and have lots of experience in buying cars! This place was the best!!!! ",5
653,17-Aug-17,Easy to get my appointment time. My wait time was short. I felt confident in Chris the DCH service Rep  He was pleasant and professional. ,5
654,14-Aug-17,Chris was very polite and efficient. We were in and out quickly which was certainly appreciated inasmuch that we had driven 90 miles to get to you! We will be recommending you to our neighbors and friends! Thanks DVH SUBARU OD RIVERSIDE!,5
655,13-Aug-17,Very friendly service staff. Very professional. They provide refreshments while you wait. Reasonable wait times. And they drive your car very carefully. Shout out to the techs working in the cars!,5
657,12-Aug-17,"I called this dealer after a light came on about 4000 miles into my roadtrip and about 400 miles from home.  they were able to fit me in, change my oil, replace the sensor, all in less than a couple hours.  Everyone was friendly and striaghtforward.  ",5
659,11-Aug-17,"Everyone was great, Janet & Donald were knowledgeable & super helpful, we were in & out of the dealership in less than an hour & a half.  I have never had such a quick & painless car buying experience. I highly recommend DCH Subaru!!",5
661,10-Aug-17,Chris Chavez was very helpful and kept me posted on status. Everyone did what they said would be done and I am quite happy. Better than Irvine Subaru.,5
662,08-Aug-17,They were personable caring and both knowledgable and professional. Always providing prompt and effective service correcting issues   I feel like family rather than just another customer. I live in Sun City CA and this is the only vehicle for me and my dad who is elderly and does not drive they always take care of me in a timely manner.  This the best beaker I have ever had the pleasure of working with. I highly recommend them to everyone especially family and friends,5
663,08-Aug-17,"My mysterious problem was resolved quickly and at no charge. Even though dealers' hourly rate is higher than that in other shops, the knowledge of the specialized experts can make it actually cheaper to go to a dealer - certainly to the Riverside Subaru dealership off the 91 freeway, at Indiana and Adams. And it is very pleasant, too.",5
664,07-Aug-17,"     Greetings:  To Subaru Upper Mgmt.  -  This review is over a month in coming, so my apologies for just now getting to it.  I've been very busy taking care of other business also, and since I'm now retired, and it is only me making all of the decisions, it is important for me to ""cover all of the bases"",  as much as possible, wherever needed.  Being retired is more ""work"" than I imagined it would be.  Also, believe it or not, I'm not one to review my ""Inbox"" each and every day.  No sir, that is not my ""modus operandi"".  I'm doing good just checking my bank statement, once or twice a week,  for available funds, and then move on.  For my emails; it is not unusual for me to check in on things only once every month, or two.  Really.  My life does not revolve around a computer; not anymore anyway, especially now that I have retired from my previous employment.  I was glad to leave that computer, believe me!!  I sometimes forget though that other people's lives, or employment status,  are dependent on customer's evaluations via ""computer"", such as it is with DCH Subaru of Riverside.  Again, my sincerest apologies.  Okay, then, now onto my 2017 Outback.....
     Concerning my recent purchase with DCH Subaru of Riverside, I have to say to Upper Mgmt. that it was the most satisfying car purchase of my entire ""career"" of buying vehicles in the past, whether they were new, or used.  ""THE MOST SATISFYING.....""  And I don't say that lightly, either ( it's 3:31 a.m. in the morning, so I'm not kidding).  Salesman Daniel Gressman worked with me TO THE FULLEST,  and made it HIS TOP PRIORITY so that he could do all that he could to ensure that my time there was one that I wouldn't soon forget.  The same goes for Finance Mgr. Donald Smalley, Service Mgr. Ruben Perez, and of course, Sales Mgr. Amin Noori, whose infectious smile and sense of humor were most appreciated (he's a cool guy, that one), and even young Cory in the service dept., for having a good attitude and being careful in bringing back my Subaru from the Fullerton Dealership. They ALL made me feel like I was THE MOST IMPORTANT CUSTOMER OF THE DAY.  They were relaxed, focused, and all the while exuding their professional status with a genuine demeanor.  These individuals really went out of their way to make this the best buying experience for me, EVER.  And, they succeeded.  Reading some of the other reviews:  ""Fantastic people"", Fabulous experience"",  most readily apply.  Adding to these previous remarks - "" Exceptional professionalism coupled with an underlying  belief that EACH customer is the ONLY customer that needs to be taken care of"".  That's what I experienced that Sat., the 2nd of July, 2017.  Subaru definitely has a ""crew of five"", anyway, that deserves more than just an ""Attaboy"";  they each deserve to receive a ""PAY RAISE"" for their efforts.  At least, that's the way that I see it.  Upper Mgmt.  -  is anybody listening???
     Okay, it's late, and I need to get some rest, for sure.  Let me finish now by saying that this 2017 Subaru Outback is the FINEST VEHICLE THAT I HAVE EVER OWNED, PERIOD.....  Subaru has really raised the bar and I'm DEFINITELY GLAD that I have one of my own.  Subaru has really hit a ""home run"" here..... KUDOS TO SUBARU AND THE FIVE INDIVIDUALS I WORKED WITH AT DCH SUBARU, RIVERSIDE on that previously mentioned day.  Good evening and keep up the GREAT WORK. 
     
                                                                               Sincerely,

                                                                               Mr. Dale Archuleta

666,28-Jul-17,"Brian was on his way in to the office at It's opening.  We didn't even give him a chance to drink his coffee.  We followed him in, and made made our inquiries about a specific vehicle.  He made us comfortable, introduced us to Amin in Finance and the Manager of the dealership, and Daniel, his co-worker in internet sales.
They did not have my specific vehicle.  A min worked his magic, and found exactly what I wanted at an Irvine facility.  Something other dealerships did NOT do.  He made a trade of one of his for one of theirs, and sent a driver to get it.
I am ecstatic!  Love my car, and the treatment I received.  DCH Subaru is now part of my family.",5

680,12-Mar-17,"Pro: QUICKEST in and out in purchasing a car EVER. I literally timed them and I was in and out in 2.5 hours, to include a test drive, them cleaning and filling up the car, and doing the car introductions showing me the system. 

Matt Kraft is a total car guy and knows cars. I walked out of a dealership the day before because the dealer knew less than I did. I was happy that I did not have to correct Matt on the trim model of the vehicle I wanted. 

Although Matt didn't want to discuss cost or anything online except promising me that he will make sure he won't lose my sale to cost....but I needed to show up at the shop before he'd negotiate. I hesitated because it's a trap....BUT...Matt and the management team delivered on his promise plus some. 

Con: I can honestly say...NONE. 

Back to Pro....I got the negotiated price I wanted to pay with no back and forth. I did my research and walked in with the price I wanted to walk out with and Matt made it happen. 

THE BEST car buying experience EVER...and I have 5 vehicles and just bought 3 in the last two years. This was such a great experience, I will be pre-ordering my next car with Matt when a 2018 releases.",5

684,25-May-16,"we were buying our teenager a reliable car & the subaru impreza was on or near the top of every review- being a member of costco savecar program led us to riverside subaru-in short order matt kraft of riverside subaru called me, set an appointment & off i went- once at dealership matt was tied up with another customer but gordon lai had me in an impreza for test drive & away we go- gordon went over the strong points of subaru i.e. consumer reports most reliable, top resale value, safety and of coarse outstanding gas mileage- once we arrived back at the dealership there was no arm twisting just a price and options like leasing vs buying and within an hour and fifteen minutes we were writing the deal- from there i signed with the finance manager amin noori, met with the sales manager scott & made arrangements to come back to pick up the car with my wife- went back to the dealership to pick up the car & matt kraft was made sure he went over the finer points of the car with my wife- great experience & I would & will recommend this group to my friends & family

685,18-Apr-16,"My wife and I recently purchased a 2016 Subaru Forester from DCH Subaru of Riverside. We had the pleasure of working with Matt Kraft, Gordon Lai and Amin Noori. Matt and Gordon gave us the necessary information to pick out the perfect car and Amin helped us finalize an awesome deal.

We highly recommend DCH Subaru of Riverside and don't forget to ask for Matt, Gordon or Amin for help!",5
686,31-Mar-16,By far one of the best experiences I've had with a dealership. After an awful experience at another local Subaru dealership I went in with my guard up. I am rather young and am often not treated right at dealerships with the thought that I'm unable to afford any of their cars. But that wasn't the case here. They found me exactly what I was looking for to the letter and not once questioned my ability to pay for it or insinuate that I would default on a loan (as the last dealership had done). They were very friendly and patient with me through the whole process even when hiccups happened but they weren't phased and continued plugging along so I could drive away with my perfect car. Wonderful experience and if you need a car talk to Daniel. He knows his cars and isn't afraid to let you really test drive these beautiful cars. Thanks guys!,5
688,22-Feb-16,DCH of Riverside was such a great experience for buying my used vehicle! I was so pleased with their service and everyone there who helped me:) I would suggest this dealership to anyone. ,5
