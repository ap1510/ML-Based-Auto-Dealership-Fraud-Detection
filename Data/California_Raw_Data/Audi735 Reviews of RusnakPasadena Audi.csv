0,18-Apr-20,The service dept. seems to be dedicated to handling every single thing possible...even seat-belts that are slow to retract!  My car is always ready when they say it will be; they check with me about any added costs; now they even pick up and deliver my car.  I love Rusnak Audi.,4.8

10,02-Jan-20,"Ivan provided a great price for an online request for a 2019 Audi Q8 Premium Plus. No haggling. No pressure. Aggressive price and it was better than competitors within 100 miles. The deal was complete before I arrived at the dealership with a cashier's check. I was on my way in an hour or so. A very pleasant experience. Before I left, they walked me through the Audi MMI user experience and other features about the car. I cannot recommend Ivan and Rusnak more highly. Most dealers wanted me to come in to talk price and then haggle.",5
11,30-Dec-19,"Right in the busy rush just before Christmas I hit and damaged my left wheel while turning.   I managed to drive to Rusnak and was greeted with concern, patience, and compassion.  A tire and wheel adviser was called to determine whether I needed a new wheel or just the tire.  I was advised to have the wheel replaced.  The service adviser located a matching wheel in Germany which would take 10-14 days to arrive.  After 2 days of an Enterprise rental, the service adviser arranged for a complimentary ""loaner"" for me which save me hundreds of dollars.  The entire time I was kept apprised of the progress of the repairs and updated as needed.  My calls to the adviser were returned almost immediately.  My car was completely checked for further damage and needed service.  The repairs were completed in a timely manner and the car looks great again.  ",5
12,17-Dec-19,"I'd like to say I ended up at Rusnak Audi as a result of an unfortunate event. I had an accident and totaled my car. My dad and I decided to stop by just to look at the new Audi q3 since I had not seen close look nor had a test drive, on our drive back home to Orange County. 
As soon as we walked in we were welcome by Jose. Jose was very nice and put all his effort into helping us to come to a deal on a price that I would be able to afford. It all worked out in just a few hours on my Audi Q3 was ready to go. I can't recommend Rusnak Pasadena enough! The car is beautiful and loving it already. Thanks for the great awesome experience. Very exciting to be part of the Audi family. ",5

Next time my car is due for service I will definitely request Johnny as my service advisor. ",5

38,15-Sep-19,"We searched online to purchase a new Q5.  Excellent follow up from our salesman, Warren. He heard everything I was concerned about and we found him to be very trustworthy; not an adjective I usually use with car salesmen.  I was fearful about learning the new technology, but Arnold Diaz made it as comfortable as possible and most importantly told me I could reach out to him for more tutoring.  I certainly would come back here if I was buying again.",5
39,15-Sep-19, Johnny Borja I would say is the Best service Specialist. He is very courteous and helpful. It’s one of the reasons why I always get our cars from you. ,5
40,14-Sep-19,"Took my Q3 in for its 35K service, I was treated great and everything went well. I knew I had a bad wiper blade in the back that had half the rubber hanging from it. I double checked that they would check out my blades and they said yes. 
When I went to pick up my vehicle I checked the paperwork and it didn’t show that they replaced a wiper blade. It said they checked it. So when my car came out I checked it and it had the old ripped blade still on it. 
my question is... if they didn’t catch an obvious thing like this, what else did they skip over on a $500 service?  I bought a new blade and they replaced it while I waited. 
I know it’s a wiper blade but I left thinking, what else didn’t they check? not a good experience. ",3
41,14-Sep-19,"Took Q7 to Rusnak for oil change & 20K mile checkup. Arrived without an appointment, parked in service area & stood near outside service desk. Stood there about 5 minutes while service reps talked to a Hispanic Lady at stand, who I assumed, was in charge. Got a little annoyed because, not only didn't she say anything to me, she didn't acknowledge my presence. She walked pass me, so she had to see me there. Before leaving, which I was about to, I went inside and asked Ian if anybody could help me. Ian handled everything. He took my info, arranged for the vehicle's service & arranged a ride home for me. Also, contacted me when vehicle was done & arranged ride back to dealership. Can't say enough good things about his service. The lady at the desk needs retraining. Rusnak was a few minutes away from losing me forever as a customer. Nobody is too busy to say, ""I'll be with you in a few minutes.""",2.5

48,28-Aug-19,"My service rep Henry Perez is the best ever! He is helpful, nice and efficient. Too bad they make him conduct the payment part now. Takes a lot of his time to help other customers. Henry informs me what needs to be done and what is going to be done. I wouldn't go anywhere else. ",4.6

60,17-Aug-19,"I brought my car in for a recall issue and was told it would be 90 min. I also had an issue with my door which I asked them to look at as well. I said I would wait for the car and after 3 hours I sought out the service person  to see why my car was taking so long... he said it still was not ready. At that point I could not wait. The loaner car experience was another hour befor I got back to work.

91,18-Jul-19,"My first service was great. Setting up an appointment was east and even the service. I decided whether downtown la Audi was a better choice since it's close to home, but after some reviews checking, I decided my dealer Rusnak Audi was for me. I was not disappointed. Got there a few minutes before my appointment, let me know what was going to happen with my vehicle, David Sickler took care of my car and keep me updated when it was almost done & when it was almost out of the car wash. My wait was about an 1hr 15 or so.  ",5
92,17-Jul-19,"First, big thanks for the courtesy car - an S6 Quattro, which is significantly more upscale than my A3 etron I took in for service.

I’m giving 5 stars because of the nice loaner car, but feel compelled to point out a couple things for constructive criticism:

1) The car was apparently washed, but not very carefully, as there was bug sap and various debris on the front that wasn’t scrubbed off.

2) Since my car is a plug-in hybrid, it would have been good customer service to return it to me fully charged, rather than just leaving 4 miles of charge left on the battery.

3) The wear levels on the tires were different in all four corners, so it would have been good to rotate the tires so the two fronts and the two rears were more evenly matched left/right.

These are nitpicky things, but it’s the small things and attention to detail that sets apart good service and stellar service.",4.8

I did have an issue picking up my car from the sales desk. The service department left my keys and paperwork for after-hours pick up (which I've done before) and the receptionist at the sales desk said she did not have my car. She did not offer any resolutions or search through her files. She just said that no one gave her anything and I would have to wait until Monday morning to come back and pick up my car (it was Saturday afternoon.) After being a little upset, then she asked a manager for help. Turns out my paper work was on her desk the entire time and she just didn't see it. I would not have been as annoyed if she had offered some sort of resolution (or tried to find one) instead of being so quick to tell me I was out of luck.",4.8

216,08-Sep-18,"This recent service was managed quite poorly - not the physical repair, but the actions around it. A4 was first brought in Mon AM 8/27 for airbag recall. I typically worked w/ Johnny Borjas but he’s no longer an option. When I dropped off A4, I also reviewed a number of other maintenance items w/ Anthony and I made it clear which ones were required to be done and which were to be checked and reviewed with me before proceeding. The one specific item that had to be repaired was the fuel filler door (any car that you can’t refuel is pretty much a one-ton rock. I rec’d first feedback late Mon 8/27 afternoon, and as the airbag was going to require repair into Tues, a loaner car was offered. Everything was great to this point. When I returned on Tues 8/28 to pick up my A4, I reviewed the papers and I saw that the fuel filler door wasn’t repaired. I reviewed this with service advisor (my apologies as I didn’t catch his name), and I was given an extension on loaner until that repair was completed. The estimate was completion on Friday 8/31 - perfectly reasonable. 

There was no communication from Rusnak service prior to long weekend but one extra service day wasn’t unreasonable. I did make inquiries on car’s status via text msg replies to the original push notification sent by Rusnak Audi but none were answered. The first significant notification of status during Week 2 was a call on Tues 9/4 to say that additional parts were required and had to be ordered. How was this not known the prior week when the “work” began on the fuel filler door on Tues 8/28?

Overall, this engagement was sloppy. The numerous handoffs amongst 3-4 advisors, the parts ordering, the lack of replies to my text inquiries. The one thing that masked much of the troubles was that I had the loaner car, but even that was “returned” on 8/28 and had to be re-issued 30 minutes later (see above). 

So while the repair was apparently completed correctly, the overall experience wasn’t anywhere near the level of service that I’ve previously had at Rusnak. This you need to know. There were too many hand-offs and a lack of information throughout. ",2.6
217,08-Sep-18,"My sister purchased her Audi here, so I decided to look at the dealership. George Pau far exceeded my expectations. He was very knowledgeable , accommodating and did everything to make me comfortable with my final decision to purchase my Audi. I would definitely recommend this dealership.",5

221,30-Aug-18,"Having dealt with Rusnak Audi for 13 years, when I leased my first Audi, in my experience across the board the service department is of the highest quality, personalized, accommodating in every way, and efficient. Absolutely excellent service. From regular maintenance to the occasional tricky issue, they track and also step up and meet the needs of the car. There is never a question about providing customers with a loaner (formerly a rental) of the highest quality, equivalent to what the customer owns, and the check-out and check-in process is very streamlined. Speed of diagnosis, always very fast, and they can be counted on to help customers evaluate and decide how to move forward when t here are options. I dealt with one service advisor for many years, Johnny Borja, but have had the pleasure of dealing with others, most recently Vince Stamegna, who is  equally personable and extremely helpful. I have leased twice and bought one vehicle at the end of a lease from Rusnak, and the sales department is also absolutely excellent, again, streamlining every aspect of a lease or purchase process.

Pasadena one also had just as great service. Coming back to Pasadena dealer yesterday (August 2018) for the first time in months, I saw improvements. The new advisor who took me in was probably the nicest and most professional one I've seen in dealderships. Transportation after dropping off the car and coming back to the dealership to pickup the car was done through Uber and it worked out so good and convenient. Great job.  ",4.6

235,05-Aug-18,"I never knew car shopping could actually be fun. I was lucky enough to work with Larry Gootkin at Ruskin/Pasadena. What a wonderful experience. I told Larry the Audi I wanted with the exact specifications and features. He got right on it and worked tirelessly. He spent hours researching and was in constant contact with me to try to find my ideal car. He always followed up with me and I felt taken care of and secure. He was nice, honest, knowledgeable very professional. He found me the exact car I was looking for, and at a much cheaper price than I expected to pay. No other dealer could do this for me. The whole process was a pleasure and really fun. We actually formed a friendship. Who can say that about their car salesman? I only wish I needed a car every year, so I could work with Larry again and again. Buying a car should be fun. It shouldn’t feel like torture. Do yourselves a favor and skip all the misery. Go to Ruskin/Pasadena and see Larry if you need a new car. You’ll be very glad you did.
Thank you SO MUCH for all your hard work Larry! You’re the best!",5

278,04-Apr-18,"From my first inquiry online through the signing of the purchase agreement, Rusnak absolutely exceeded my expectations. The interactions were professional, transparent, and responsive. After applying for credit with Audi, I was required to select a dealer even though I was already working with a car buying service. For the first time in years, my interaction with a dealership were equal to the personalized service I've received from the car buying service, and much to my surprise Rusnak was able to beat their proposed pricing and terms so i ended up finalizing the purchase with Rusnak.

I arrived 2:30 to make a service appt. for the following day; I thought to ask if could be accommodated same day; the initial staff thought it would not be possible due to workload/previous appts. (understandable).  However, it was suggested I speak directly with a service rep (Henry Perez) and that is when things began to happen.

He quickly evaluated the service needed based on mileage; gave me an estimated time to complete, and within 1 1/2 hours I was accommodated, work was completed, service was reviewed, estimated time of next service (very professional); and I was on my way, thanks to Henry..

281,17-Mar-18,Very poor customer service from this dealer. Service is set up for the benefit of the dealership rather than the customer. Hard to schedule appointments. Usually get put on hold and then transferred a few times. Often made to feel like it was an imposition to request a loaner. Several times car was not ready when promised. Service personnel (Gonzales) are more interested in pitching you to give them a good review in dealer and Audi follow ups. So much that the two times I expressed my displeasure with service I never got a follow up from either the dealer or Audi asking for feedback on my experience. Seems kind of dishonest to me to suppress negative reviews. I did not have any of these problems at another Audi dealer (Ontario Audi).   ,1.4

time to actually buy my new audi was much shorter than I experienced from other dealers in the past.
it was a pleasure doing business with them.",5
310,28-Nov-17,Rusnak needs to make sure to keep Kirk Wallace as a service rep! Hard to have a relationship with any rep with the high turnover. Kirk was awesome as long as he’s there I’ll be going back there! He was on top of everything and made sure I was well informed on the progress of my vehicle...and even if i wasn’t able to get there timely he took care of me! Thanks Kirk for everything! ,5
311,23-Nov-17,"I am an Audi loyal customer but buying my Audi from Rusnak/Pasadena Audi was the best experience I have had buying a car. Dealing with Yalonda was great. I did all the negotiation through e-mail, texting and a few phone call. I drove about 200 miles from Visalia to Pasadena to pick up my car. When I arrived my car was ready and everything was as promised. Just signed up the documents and hit back home on my new 2018 Q7 premium plus.",5
312,22-Nov-17,"Audi has been my car brand of choice for quite some time now. It should come to no surprise that I have sourced a few of their different properties in search of my dream car. The overall experience of these other Audi dealerships have been unpleasant to say the least. Perhaps it was why I would leave empty handed time and time again. The day of my Birthday I spontaneously decided to commute to the Rusnak property in Pasadena. As I made my way to the area housing the Audi’s I made contact with Sales Representative George Pau. Mr. Pau’s demeanor and accommodation was what truly sealed this deal. Whoever said hospitality did not exist in retail has yet to meet George. 

Almost a week later and I’m still reaping the benefits of consciously steering clear from my neighboring Audi store(s) and commuting over to West Colorado Blvd.

A big thank your to the Rusnak team and an even bigger thank you to George for making my day extra special. ",5
313,22-Nov-17,Very positive professional atmosphere.  Johnny was extremely helpful and a joy to speak with.  I really appreciated the texts and call I received regards by my service.,5

315,21-Nov-17,"My advisor, Vince Stamegna is the best.  My Audi(s)  (yes bought two) are in good hands.  Ruznak provides everything to make my wait (when I do) comfortable including Porto's pastries...5 star.",5
316,16-Nov-17,"From to start finish the service was exceptional. I was taken care of and knew where I had to be for every step of the way.

Love Audi!!!",5
317,16-Nov-17,"One of the smoothest experience I ever had at a dealership. Let's be real, it's not an easy task to make a car purchase (especially after getting your car totaled and having to deal with insurance). Before arriving, I'd had already visited quite a few dealerships and every time left with doubt. My dad and I were greeted by a gentlemen named Anthony who helped us through the process and answered every question in mind. Let me mention that my dad does not speak English so throughout the whole process I had to translate and Anthony was very understanding and patient. Overall it was a very pleasant experience and I would most definitely recommend to every one. ",5
318,15-Nov-17,"Very friendly, fast and excellent service by Vince. Vince was very helpful and made the service a surprisingly pleasant visit. He did a fantastic job, which left me with a smile! ",5
319,15-Nov-17,"Our 2017 Audi Q7 needed a software update so we took it to Pasadena Rusnak and they completed the programming by the end of the day and in the meantime allowed us to use a courtesy Q5 loaner.  When we picked it up they had also washed and vacuumed it, which was a pleasant surprise.  Kirk was our service rep and he did an excellent job of quickly processing our service order and making sure that our vehicle was ready and waiting for us up front when we picked it up.  Everything was handled under warranty, so no cost to us.",5
320,14-Nov-17,"I have nothing but praise for Rusnak dealership in Pasadena but mostly all of my extreme satisfaction is thanks to Ivan Lai.
He was very professional, thorough and very helpful throughout the process.

Thanks

321,08-Nov-17,"This dealer has been surprisingly great. I did not have a good Rusnak Volvo experience, so i was leery. However, with my Audi and the different location i am surprisingly very happy! From the receptionists to the service staff to the cashiers all were fast, friendly and helpful. I even like the reminder texts and emails. Very convenient! thank you!",5
322,31-Oct-17,I just bought a new Q3 and it was a good experience. The sales person worked on the price and contract. I recommend the dealer,5
323,30-Oct-17,"While I would rate the Salesperson’s professnalism highly (5) I would rate overall buying experience as mediocre (2) at best. The Audi portion seems to be the busiest and yet the most congested. The actual purchase went well but once some details that needed attention were discovered there seemed to be much confusion as to who/when they were going be attended to. FINALLY after 4 re-visits all but one item has been resolved. The final item will be taken care of by my MORE local Audi dealer to save the need for another 1 hour drive. 

Once again I would give the Saleasperson Chenchen Yu high marks but she needs more organized support from the Dealership. ",3.5
324,26-Oct-17,"I had an amazing experience with my Service Supervisor Johnny Borja...  My new audi 2017 was
riding really rough, along with my blue tooth not working well..   We took a test drive and diagnosed the problems.    I was treated so well...  They gave me a first class loaner.... and the car was ready before the end of the day....

329,07-Oct-17,"I needed professional help. After 8 years living in London without any need for a car, I was moving back to the US and needed to get a new car. Before arrival, I did my research and was reasonably certain I wanted an Audi S5 Sportback. But I certainly wouldn't buy it without driving it. I'll be living in Pasadena, so wanted to go to the local dealer, which is Rusnak. I got in touch with Ricardo Torres a few weeks before moving back to Pasadena, and he was brilliant in helping explain leasing options and getting us preapproved while we were still in the UK. One day after we arrived in LA, I was test driving a few Audi models for comparisons. Ricardo Torres was great at getting us acquainted with the new cars and new technologies. The performance of the S5 convinced me it was indeed the right car for me. Ricardo helped us stay calm and collected throughout the leasing process. He was always there to answer any of our questions, was knowledgeable about the S5, and helped us navigate our choices. The financing process was also very smooth. And when we picked up the car, we had an excellent technology lesson from Matthew Dowley to help us understand the tech aspects. Working with Ricardo Torres was a real pleasure. After nearly 10 years without even needing a car, I needed to be brought into the 21st century, and we couldn't be happier with our new S5 or with the excellent customer service from Rusnak. I would definitely recommend Ricardo Torres if you are looking for a great guide.",5

When I arrived to drop off my car, everything went smoothly. I was called to let me know car was done. Pick Up of car was equally smooth. ",5
335,23-Sep-17,"I went in for a recall and I can't ""recall"" a nicer experience with a dealership. Johnny in particular went above and beyond. I was extremely happy that I had a loaner so I could continue with my work. My car was finished on time and delivered to me with a smile. Thank you!!!",5
336,17-Sep-17," Excellent experience. Next line they did an amazing job. Call me appropriately. Arrange a rental I had of time. Very satisfied with the overall service experience.

337,14-Sep-17,Henry was knowledgeable and communicated clearly the work that needed to be done and the time it would take before my car was ready.

It was handled in a timely manner and a rental car was give to me at the time by Enterprise.  The service at Enterprise was also excellent.  The 2nd service was not really a service.  I felt I needed additional ""training"" on the navigation system.  I scheduled an appointment and the service guy was patient and really explained the system in depth.  He was so good that even I was able to understand. Sorry ... I am technophobic.  I wish I could remember the guy's name.",5

Rick greeted me and told me he was there and if I wanted to look around, to please do so and to call him over when I was ready. I did look around familiarizing myself with the products I'd been researching online the week before. After checking out a few cars, I flagged him over and asked him a few questions which then proceeded with a test drive. I have a few more months left on my current lease and told him I wouldn't be buying, and he didn't seem to be mad, but genuinely wanted to show me the car. He sealed the deal with me and any of my friends looking for Audis will be going to see Rick.",5

408,17-Dec-16,"Had to take the new Audi Q3 2.0 turbo back to dealer in two weeks with engine related problem. The car was shaking sometimes, and the engine was rough on idling. Audi explained this as an intake camshaft problem, and strongly recommended to replace it. Everything went smooth, and the work was done pretty fast. Audi gave as a loaner vehicle, and we got the car back in less than three days. Well done Audi!
 The service associate Jim was very nice and kind, returning calls, and explaining all the performed repair procedures. The engine works fine, so far, and very smooth on idling.
Thank you very much! ",5

I needed to update my Audi Care, and Henry personally walked be over to the person that could handle it.  In Henry's busy days, he always makes me feel important.  That is a gift!",5
410,12-Dec-16,"Despite living in Santa Monica where an Audi dealership is close by, I continue to drive to Pasadena to have my car serviced each year.   Love the friendly, helpful staff at Rusnak, the ease of scheduling service, the prompt help when arriving, the comfortable waiting area and the knowledgeable and professional assistance.

I am so grateful for service advisor Henry Perez.   Knowing my drive, he has continued to schedule me after the worst of the morning traffic and has had me back on the road headed home before the afternoon back-ups begin.   He has fully explained the services needed and has helped me with extras like getting my iPhone re-synched with my car.  When I let him know that I will be exploring Pasadena, he calls my to let me know when my car is almost ready so I can make my way back to the dealership.   His helpfulness is a big part of my continuing to make the trip to Rusnak.

I have had my Audi 5 years and have had no trouble with it at all.   I attribute that to the great service professionals who do the servicing.   And if that isn't enough, they wash the car before delivering it to me.   Should I need a car during servicing, that option is quickly available.   Rusnak definitely exceeds my expectations when it comes to great service.   Thank you so much for the great experience.",5

414,03-Dec-16,"My spouse and I were highly satisfied with the service we received from Audi at Rusnak Auto Group.

In particular, Ivan has been truly amazing: he was considerate, available and helpful.

We are foreigners and, although we had previously purchased a car in the US, it was our first time leasing one.

Ivan took time to research exactly the car we wanted, offered us a great deal without playing all the frustrating bargaining games, and explained everything about the car in details.

Compared to all other dealerships we have been in touch with, Rusnak Pasadena plays in a different league and based on this first satisfactory experience, there is no doubt we will come back and purchase our next car there.

Ever since we bought our car at Rusnak Pasadena, we jump at every opportunity to recommend the dealership around us.",5

421,12-Nov-16,"Review for Ricardo “Rick” Torres at Rusnak | Pasadena Audi

Best sales experience I have EVER had buying a car!

I’m usually pressed for time because of work so when I
called Rick on the phone he was quick to help me right away 
figuring out what kind of Audi I wanted and he was fine 
coming up with some estimates.

I came in the next day to take a look and wanted to seal 
the deal the following day. He was courteous the whole way
through and never pressured me.

When I arrived in person at Rusnak to meet Rick, I could tell 
he had actually taken time to think about what I wanted and 
showed me a selection of 3 models - I was impressed!!

I landed on the Audi I wanted, but because of Rick’s expertise
I’ll plan for another model in a few years and will definitely
return to him for my next car buying experience. 

Ask for Rick at Rusnak | Pasadena Audi, you won’t be disappointed!",5

432,20-Oct-16,I took my 2012 Q5 in to try and find out why I occasionally hear a thump when turning into or backing out of a parking space. The service department could not reproduce the issue (of course) so Johnny asked me to go on a drive with the technician to see if I could get it to happen. Of course I could not but the fact that they spent 30 minutes with me and were as intent as I was to find the problem says a lot about their staff. Each of the five times I've used Rusnak Audi service (Johnny) I experience the same level of attention and detail. It's very much appreciated!,5

Vince quoted me a price for a repair, and only by accident did I find a service coupon for this same repair on your website.  I brought it to Vince's attention and he made the adjustment, however it would have been nice for him to proactively bring this to my attention rather than the execption because I found it was a special.

My A4 has been using oil at an alarming rate. Apparently there is under warranty and Henry walked me through the procedure - adjustment and replacement of some parts now, then a return when the car needs oil next time.

Not the overall experience I was accustomed to. ",3.8

From the moment we walked in, Danny Ranft treated us in the most professional and friendly way.  He made the whole car buying process seem so effortlessly.

Egan and his coworkers were great and made the process effortless. ,5

Vince is the Man...

555,23-Jan-16,"THE SERVICE ADVISOR WAS VERY POLITE AND KNOWLEDGEABLE. CALLED ME AND GAVE ME THE UPDATES.  HE ASKED ME IF I NEEDED A LIFT BACK TO WORK. I HAD MY RIDE ALREADY.
LATER HE CALLED AND MAID SOME RECOMMENDATIONS. THAT CAR WAS GOING TO BE READY
IN ONE HOUR.",5
556,17-Jan-16,"I'm not a number at Rusnak, I'm a customer with a car that the team knows and remembers.  My service representative, Vince Stamegna, remembers every service I've had since I purchased my CPO Audi Q5 two years ago.  And while I deal with Vince directly, other service advisors are standing by to offer assistance too.

It might be possible to save a little money at an independent shop, but I'm not sure the value translates.  I have a confidence that the Rusnak team understands Audis, and will be attentive to issues that arise, and can also anticipate problems too.  

Prior to owning my Audi, I would venture to independents.  Not anymore.  The service is smart, they go the extra mile in every possible way, I trust their work, and they always deliver on time.  

Finally, it's nice to know that the Service Advisor truly understands how these cars work.  Vince not only answers questions, but he makes sure that I understand what is being done and why.  The dealership is picky about its employees, and I'm picky about who works on my car.  

Sincerely,

Happy Customer",5
557,17-Jan-16,"All the service reps we dealt with were extremely helpful, answering all our questions thoroughly. Especially, Egan, who walked us through the process personally. We definitely recommend Rusnak Audi service!",5

So happy with our experience here and highly recommend Audi as a brand as well as this dealership for customer service.",5

I have been a Rusnak Audi customer for 16 years",4.8
561,15-Jan-16,"Out of the six dealerships I have taken vehicles to in the past 15 years, I have been most impressed by Rusnak Audi service.  Others are good.  Rusnak, in my 3 years of being a customer, excels.  I have one service specialist I work with, (Vince S.) and when I have needed a loaner, Paul has assisted me.  Both of these Rusnak representatives are excellent customer advocates, making sure everything is taken care of as well as being prompt and concerned.  I would recommend to anyone looking for Audi service to visit Rusnak.  They provide no-cost loaners, all very nice vehicles.  They schedule appointments so you don't have to wait, which I never have had to.  And if you just prefer a ride, they have door to door service.  Overall a very good experience.",4.8

563,08-Jan-16,Salesperson George is what makes the world of difference for me to return to Rusnak. I know him personally but he treats all customers to the best purchasing experience you can ever have. Plus service is above all expectations. I have to recommend Vince for stopping at nothing to answer all your needs.,5
564,07-Jan-16,"I came in because of an engine warning light.  I was able to get an appointment effortlessly and got processed in very quickly.  The problem was a gas vapor filter.  They not only fixed than but gave the car a once over and toped off fluids, even though it had been less than 5K miles since the last service. No charge to me (I have the pre-paid svc plan along with my lease). Got a ride to work too.",5
565,06-Jan-16,"Great location...not good listeners...Called to change my apt...they agreed...yet the email gave the old time and when I called to change again, they still had me at the old time.

Arrived early...no one welcomed me outside nor made it easy for me to park...then, I had to wait for a service person assigned to me...who I'd never met nor knew about.

Waited in nice, clean, lighted room with adequate coffee and a few remaining ""normal"" muffins.

Car was ready on time and the departure/paperwork handled nicely.

Just felt it wasn't a true Audi experience...other dealerships in other parts of the country more ""in tune"" with the Audi brand.

Also, on 2-3 different occasions staff spoke Spanish to each other in front of me...seemed rude.",3
566,30-Dec-15,I had an overall pleasant experience typically what you would expect at a dealership. The only issue is I wish they would cut the wait time to do paperwork. Christian was very straightforward and easy to deal with.,5
567,28-Dec-15,"I was looking for a car for our daughter. We have Q7 already and she wanted to get an SUV as well. Her current lease expired end of December. 
When we came to the dealership, we were greeted by the receptionist who introduced us to Danny Ranft. He is a very friendly and professional individual. He gave us a great deal on the Q3 for my daughter which she loves by the way.  
I am not a fan of the typical car buying experience, but Danny made our transaction as smooth as possible. 5 stars all the way!!",5

569,22-Dec-15,"Nice job, but a couple of problems:  there was no one to greet me when I parked the car for service, and it took about ten minutes for someone to be able to help me.  It seemed like an understaffing problem.  Second, my wife mentioned to two people that there was a broken part on the driver's side visor that needed to be fixed.  It wasn't fixed and no one followed up on the problem.  It needs to be fixed.",3.4
570,20-Dec-15,"It's my first Audi and I must say, I'm more in love with the service then anything else....Love the car of course, what's not to love....

I went to the one in BH a few months ago and hated my experience. I drive up to Pasadena simply because the service is what you expect it to be as a client paying premium dollars for a premium car. 

Love it, that simple! Happy Holiday to you all. ",5

He leaves such an impression that no matter where you are, you still go back to him.  As far as the service itself and the dealership, outstanding.

The sales process was as good as I could have expected including the paperwork and discussion of extended warranty, etc. Follow up has been excellent and everything has been delivered as promised. The sales rep I dealt with, David Carter, was very helpful in all aspects of the purchase. My recent service visit was a very good experience in all aspects. Numerous individuals in the service area stopped to ask me if there was anything they could do as I waited for my car. Egan, my service rep, thoroughly explained everything to me. ",5

623,13-Aug-15,"While fueling my Q7, the gas filler door would not open.  With a tug and a little push, the filler door came off and I was able to see that the electric filler door lock was in the locked position.  Another tug and push and the interior door was opened and I was able to fill the gas tank.  I called Rusnak, talked to Monica, and explained my problem.  She told me to come in and see Henry in the service department.  I was there in 15 minutes.  Henry had the paperwork ready and with a couple of signatures, my car was off to be checked and repaired.  In just over an hour, Henry returned my key and presented me with a fixed and very clean car.  Everything was covered under warranty.  
This was the first time I have used the service department at Rusnak. Based on the filler door problem and how quick it was handled, I will take my car there for normal service. Great job Monica, Henry, and Rusnak!
P.S. When I brought the Q7 in April, Christopher Sy made the buying of the Q7 a breeze.  I have recommended Rusnak to several friends who are in the market to purchase a new vehicle.

Cesar Zavala from Rusnak was quick to respond and most informative.  It took about 3 weeks before we were ready to pull the trigger and Cesar did a great job of keeping in touch, but not in an annoying way, just in a way that made us feel like he truly wanted our business.  At the end, we were between two cars - one at Beverly Hills Audi (a lot closer to home) and one at Rusnak.  Cesar bent over backwards to get us a great deal and even better service that it made it worth driving out to Pasadena.  And while the transaction took longer than anticipated, due to circumstances outside Cesar's control, he did everything to make my pregnant wife, our dog Cookie and I comfortable and well attended too.  It is that kind of service that has earned our business now and in the future.",5
633,23-Jul-15,"Love audis, # 4.
Tough review on yelp one star. ""Don't buy a car from Rusnak unless you like waiting for service""

The sales guy David Yee was excellent. After that, service is impossible to schedule and gain a commitment for how much time it will take.  ""Drop your car off for 4-6 hours"" is the basic answer. Don't buy the extended service because getting something done takes 10-12 calls to schedule and 2 trips and great frustration. I can't imagine doing this for the life of the car.

- A second key: As a customer i spent over 5 hours getting my second key? Most people get 2 keys when you buy a nice car, or any car. I had to schedule a day to go back, wait for a really nice guy to come out and say, hey our computers are down you'll have to schedule another appointment to get your key. I asked why he didn't call me and it never occurred to him. That second trip took only 2 hours? 
- Schedule a detail to estimate a scratch: After a cart bumped my car I needed to have it washed and estimated. Over two weeks of calling with no answer and leaving my name and number the answer is from the receptionists ""drop it off for 4-6 hours"". Really

David Yee, who no longer works there, is the only person to return my call.
I spoke to the sales manager Chris P. and ask for a cost to return the car to Rusnak after 8 weeks and 2000 miles. Still waiting for that return call he promised",1

The next day I spoke to Cesar, arranged an appointment to look at the car, and arranged financing before hand.

642,25-Jun-15,"Seriously, one star is more than enough for this shop. 

We bought an Audi A3 these days and it turns out the manager is playing some tricks on the price we shake hands on. We agreed on the deal the first day and we did all the paperwork that day. But we didn't receive the car since it was in transpiration from Orange County. That cool, and we just hold till the next day. It was odd that the manager bring up another paperwork to me not mentioning anything but financial program was changed. I sighed the paper without deeply looking onto it because I trusted this team. However, I realized there was 1500 dollars more than the price we agreed and signed the first day. 

Now, the manager Eric explained that it was my problem that my income doc cannot get Audi fanantial approved. Holy xxxx, Audi fanantial? Lucky me, first time to hear of it! 

xxxx happens every time, but this is our recent horrible experience with this store, looks like they don't really care about small businesses. They are lack of professional of explaining things ahead. They are not patient when setting up the price. Dealers are nice and helpful, but that manager is busy of making money.

Take care of signing paperwork with them, and don't waste time with Eric.",1
643,24-Jun-15,"This is a very delayed review for a very deserving salesman, Omega Chambers.  We bought our new Audi Q5 with Omega in January.  We had some very specific things we wanted in the car and he worked hard (over the Christmas / NY holiday!) to make sure we got what we wanted for the price we wanted.  It was so easy and effortless to work with Omega - we truly felt he was a guy on our side.  We also spoke briefly to other salespeople at Rusnak and everyone we spoke to was very knowledgable and nice.  

I knocked one star off for the experience we had with the finance person who we worked with on the actual contract.  He didn't seem interested or show much patience when we asked questions.  It wasn't to the level of the rest of the experience that we had with Omega.

I remember telling the Jaguar rep.  that he had lost my business for the forcible future,  and I meant it I did not buy another car from Rusnak for 14 years.  However Omega Chambers single handedly won my business and once again made me a Rusnak client.  How did he do this?  As soon as we motioned that we were interested in Q5 he had 3 models pulled from stock,  an SQ5, a TDI and a 2.0 gas model.  He intelligently answered questions about the different levels of performance and features of the different cars and offered to have us test drive what he thought would fit our requirement’s.  Long story short we purchased a fully loaded Q5 TDI.  Omega got the right car to the dealer guided us though the sales process and delivered the car.

Spoke with a new salesman for a moment and said i'd call back tomorrow.
Fortunately for me that salesman was out and i was handed to OMEGA CHAMBERS!!
Have NEVER dealt with a more knowledgable and efficient salesman EVER!
There was NO running somewhere out of sight to speak to a manager or someone else after each of my intricate questions about either the car or the process. Immediate succinct answers were all i received from Omega. Before i knew it I had EXACTLY what i wanted with the absolute LEAST amount of hassle.
This is not normal in any experience i have EVER had with a car salesman.
AND I won't mention how Omega was eager to spend whatever time necessary to completely program my new car.....NO SMALL FEAT!
To add to my PERFECT EXPERIENCE was Keti Ludzheva in financing with whom i signed all necessary papers. ALSO COMPETENT and EFFICIENT and just a great gal, the pain (spending money) was over before i knew it. I CANNOT give a 10 STAR review here but f i could it would be done.

Thanks to all at Rusnak!!!!!!!!",5
651,21-Feb-15,"You be the judge...

Had been trying to work a deal with these guys for a few years. (EVERYTHING you read about Omega Chambers is true. He's awesome)  We called them and the salesperson (Beshoy) said that they had exactly what we wanted - black CPO (Certified Pre-Owned) A3 extremely low miles from the loaner pool. My wife hustled over to the dealership. In the 53 minutes it took for her to get down there the car had been sold. When she asked why we weren't called, he shrugged and said he had been busy. I get there and Beshoy tells us that he will make us a good deal on another car. We settle on another A3 from the loaner pool. It has features we really don't want or need. We ask about a new A3 and Beshoy informs us that he doesn't have any new A3 cars on the lot for less than 36K. He got the sales manager to begrudgingly drop the price of the CPO A3 by 1K. We are told that we will be financed through Audi Finance. We were there from 1PM past 8PM. My wife missed a meeting she'd scheduled. Less than a week later, the right rear tire splits. While Audi roadside is on the way, I contact Rusnak Audi service and our salesperson Beshoy. The service manager says there's nothing they can really do and that I probably ran over something in the road. He tells me to drive around on the spare (small temporary spare, NOT full sized spare) for a couple of days and bring the car in the following Monday, but it's extremely doubtful anything can be done. I emailed a picture of the tire to Beshoy.  I drive to a tire store and purchase 2 new tires so that I can function. I had a least 100 miles a day of freeway driving that weekend and the spare was not built for that. I contacted Continental Tire and they were MORTIFIED. They asked me to simply go to any tire store that carried their product and they assured me the tire would be replaced free of charge. And they did replace the tire free of charge. This was before they even saw the picture. After I sent them the picture they were in disbelief. When I connected my mobile phone to the car, I lost features that are essential to the way I function, work and even listen to music. I called Beshoy and he told me - twice - that I needed to come in and have another tutorial. I advised him that I am a consultant for the company that makes my phone and it actually is the area of my expertise. When I called Audi customer service and some of my guys in Cupertino, they advised me that those features would not work with MMI navigation plus and Audi connect. We took the car to our detail guy and he asked us about the deep circular scratches on the hood. We were not aware how deep they were and that we would need to get the car wet sanded to get them out. Two body shops and another Audi dealership told us that there was no way the car should have been CPO in that condition. Later we got a letter from US Bank. It was informing us of a loan. Beshoy had told us to our faces that we were being financed by Audi Finance. Of course, that's our fault as we didn't check the paperwork. The person in the finance department never said anything otherwise. We have very good credit and got financed at least a full percentage than we should have. This is all within the first month of ownership. One day, the wife was talking about the car and got so angry we got up and went to Beverly Hills Audi and got EXACTLY what we were looking for BRAND NEW financed through AUDI FINANCE at a much lower rate and the first month was free with much less down and traded the car in to them. And the NEW A3 was CHEAPER than the CPO A3 from Rusnak. My iPhone works perfectly with the different MMI system in the new car and we couldn't be happier. We filed a formal complaint with Audi and never heard from Rusnak Audi. GM, salesperson (Beshoy), finance department, service all SHAMEFUL. But...YOU BE THE JUDGE.",1

I recommend him as your Sales associate for your purchases in Rusnak Pasadena.",5

He communicates willingly, promptly, and professionally to email price inquiries and negotiations. He is familiar with the promotions and incentives as well as financial and leasing options. When we started, he asked me questions to narrow down the specific car off the lot. There were 3 cars that were quite similar. Then he gave me a very good offer without much back and forth. He included the window sticker and nearly all the key numbers in correspondence before I headed to the showroom which is what I required. As you know when buying a car, getting all the deal details before traveling to the showroom will save a lot of time, effort, and usually side step miscommunication. This was my first Audi, and I definitely will work with Omega again on the next one.",5

Had been shopping around for a couple months to decide which make and model I wanted, once decided started just go online to see the best possible price I could get. Emailed a couple dealers to see what they could offer and ended up talking with Omega the internet manager at Rusnak. He was very honest and offered the best price by far. That was the main reason I called him because I thought it was a mistake but price quoted was correct. I informed him I would go down there once I could figure how I was going to get there because I wasn't trading a vehicle in and they were over 70 miles from where I live and didn't want to go back and forth to pick up vehicle and old vehicle. He offered to drive to my home in Victorville and pick me up. I agreed, I figured he would send someone but he picked me up personally. Everything worked out great, needless to say I purchased a vehicle which I love and overall one of the best car buying experiences I every had would definitely recommend Rusnak Audi for anyone looking and ask for Omega Chamber or simply contact online. Simple and easy no pressure whatsoever. ",5

659,14-Nov-14,"While my 2000 Volvo was being diagnosed at Rusnak Volvo, I decided to walk to their other dealership to look at my dream car, the Porsche Panamera.   That's when I spotted the 2011 Audi A3 2.0T Hatchback.  It was immaculate inside and out.  Within a few moments, Omega Chambers approached me, inquired about my visit and informed me the car had just been marked down.  I told him I was ""killing time"" and wasn't in the market to buy a car unless I was led otherwise.  I received a phone call about my car and needed to get back to the service center.  Omega offered to drive me and brought the Audi A3 around.  He asked if I wanted to drive it and I said yes. The moment I got in, it felt comfortable, as if it was already my car.  

After receiving the estimate for the repairs on my car, I started thinking about the idea of buying a new car.  I drove back to the Rusnak Audi and with Omega in the passenger seat, I took the car on a 30 minute test drive.  I was impressed with how it handled, Omega's knowledge of the vehicle and how he let me experience the car without an ounce of pressure. During this time, I had a chance to quiet myself and I made a decision to make an offer on the car.  We were able to come up with a deal that I felt comfortable with and because I had so much peace about everything, I knew it was the right car at the right time.  

I am someone who researches and Googles everything before I make a purchase so it is a testament to my experience with Omega and his colleagues that I was able to make this decision.  This was by far the best car buying experience I have ever had...smooth and effortless!!

I've never done a deal via phone,internet but it worked out great and Omega did an amazing job both for his dealership and the customer.  I enjoyed working with Omega and over the course of the week we both negotiated a deal that I couldn't be happier with.  I almost walked away from the deal but Omega brought me back in several times and kept me at the table.  He knew how to keep the conversation going and how to keep the deal alive.  Omega pushed at the right times and gave me space at the right times as well.  In the end he sold me the car I wanted at the Price I had budgeted for.  

The care was a used SUV and when it arrived at my house at 10:30pm after we agreed to terms earlier that evening it was perfect.  I've purchased several used high end cars before and this one was impeccable beyond belief.  You can tell that Rusnak takes pride in all of it's cars before putting their name on it.  The car was literally brand new and expertly detailed.  I was equally impressed when Omega and Jose drove up 1 hour and 45 minutes to deliver me the car the night we closed the deal.  Both were extremely polite, knowledgeable and helpful.  

This was honestly the most fun I have ever had buying a car and look forward to always coming to Rusnak 1st whenever I'm in the market!

Within a couple of hours we had the car and started the paperwork.  I told Omega exactly what the deal had to look like or it would be a nonstarter.  He met every requirement and by the next night he personally delivered the car to us, we signed the paperwork, gave him our old car in trade and we were done!!

Omega was patient, watched, listened, and asked me if I would like to take the car home for the night.  I thought he was crazy and told him so.

I was pleasantly surprised when I went to Audi to test drive the new A3 and Omega offered to lend the car to me for the afternoon.

671,24-Jun-14,"If you live in LA, go to Pasadena and ask for Vince. He's the most honest and caring Service Advisor I have ever met. If you want to wait for your vehicle while it's being serviced, the location is prime for walking, shopping, dining and movies. I have been to every Audi Service Department in LA, and thanks to Vince, I will never go anywhere else.",5
672,12-Jun-14,"I've been a customer of this dealership for over 3 years. Whether working with Vince in service or Beshoy in Sales, as a customer you are treated extremely well. 

Both are very honest, and quite frankly, the complete opposite of the stereotype of car dealership employees. Those two are both outstanding to work with, but it's clear that the entire organization values its customers and treats them with respect and appreciation.",5
673,31-Mar-14,"Rusnak was the best dealership I've been to thus far.  The price on the car and the service was clearly the best.  Beshoy was knowledgeable, nice and expedited the process.  What a great experience!  Thank you!  ",5
674,16-Mar-14,"I test drove and purchased an Audi A6 Prestige from Beshoy Abdou and found the overall experience to be great.  His initial contact (for me via email) was quick, and he responded back to an appointment time for me to test drive two separate cars.  He met me and had both cars ready to test drive.  He was very pleasant, professional and easy to work with.  There were no high-pressure sales tactics used, and we worked out a deal that I was very happy with over a series of emails that same day.

When I came to pick up the car the next day, the car looked great, and he went over in great detail all the technology features of the car and the sales details.  He noticed that during the preparation of the car that the tank wasn't filled and he took care of it immediately while I went over financing with Gladys.  Gladys, incidentally, was also very pleasant and helpful and had all of our paperwork ready to go and we were in and out in minutes.

Beshoy is well-versed on all functions of the A6 and went over everything.  He constantly checked with me and made sure all of my needs were attended to.  Great guy, great dealer.",5
675,21-Jan-14,"My husband and I stopped by the dealership to check out the used car inventory and were absolutely blown away by the customer service we received by Ray Mkrtchyan. He was incredibly friendly, knowledgeable and a true professional. He answered all of our questions and did so with a smile. He exceeded all of our expectations and made the process of buying a car a very positive one. We love the car we purchased and love the fact that Ray got us an amazing deal! THANK YOU Ray for everything, we will definitely be back!",5
676,19-Jan-14,Ray was exceptionally helpful in the process of purchasing our new vehicle. I am extremely satisfied and appreciative of the amazing care with which he approached us. He is very knowledgable and friendly. My husband and I are both satisfied with the amazing service that we received from Ray. We would recommend him to our friends and family and would definitely do business with him again. Thanks so much for making our purchasing experience so pleasant and for getting us exactly what we wanted. We love our car very much and so do the kids. :),5
677,24-Dec-13,"I gave the above high ratings simply because Beshoy was a pleasure to work with and exceeded all of my expectations in regards to professionalism and customer service. I came in with a friend to help her get a new Audi--made an appointment with Beshoy beforehand.

The first thing that struck me was his congeniality. Before anything, he wanted to make sure we were comfortable and basically got us some coffees from the machine himself. The entire procedure, from the test-drive to the negotiation was very relaxed and pleasant. He treated us completely the opposite of how I am used to be treated at rival dealerships, like one that starts with a K and is located in Van Nuys. There was no pressure, he was generally concerned that my friend got what she wanted and did a thorough job in all aspects.

Lastly, the dealership had closed, yet Beshoy acted as if it were noon and took my friend for an extremely lengthy tour of the car's interior and exterior, showing her just about everything--if not everything about how the car works, etc. I would only deal with him again if I went back to Rusnak, even though other dealers, who were not invested in the sale, were friendly as well.

Kevin, the finance manager was also pleasant and very accommodating. I usually find finance managers cold and boring. But Kevin had an amiable personality and made an otherwise dull experience all the more cheerful.

If I was not happy with the service at Rusnak, I would not have filled out this survey. I look forward to returning soon, either with another friend or for myself.

He is the reason I came back for a second car. I live near the Santa Monica Audi and my experience with Santa Monica Audi was awful so I came out to Rusnak in December (for my first Audi) where I met with Beshoy who takes customer service to a new level. 

Six months later I was back in again because my car was totaled when someone hit me. Beshoy got the exact car I wanted. He was patient and never pushed me into something I didn't want. I can't thank him enough. Your sales, finance team, and maintenance team at Rusnak are top notch. I appreciate how well everyone treated me during the process! Beshoy stayed with me until I drove off the lot he made sure every detail of the car was perfect before I left. I really appreciate his dedication an support and in 42 months I'll be back for another through Beshoy!",5

Beshoy was the first to respond to my email from all the Audi dealerships and it was not an automated generic email. He had amazing professionalism and searched for what we were looking for. He was willing to provide us with what we wanted and gave us the best price possible. We purchased a 2013 Audi Q5 S-line with sports package from Beshoy Abdou. If you want someone who genuinely believes in great customer service and will take care of you, go to Beshoy to buy your Audi. He is very organized and knows his facts on Audi vehicles. Beshoy went over every detail on the car. Thanks Beshoy for everything! ",5

685,24-May-13,"I gave this dealer, and especially Beshoy Abdou a 5! He treated us with such respect and class, was super respectful, genuine, patient, and did not pressure us. He spent  an hour with us telling us about different options and helping us choose the car that best met our needs financially and practically. We were just looking without really planning to buy yet. But not only did we fall in love with the car, we decided to go back the following week to buy it because Beshoy was such a pleasure to work with. He helped us find the best car for our needs. When I did go back to buy, he spent 4 hours with me making sure that I understood all aspects of the buying experience, made sure all paperwork was in order, even spent 30 minutes getting paperwork together and contacting the dealer of my previous car to make sure that I got a refund on my warranty, something I did not even know was possible! After all the paperwork was complete, he sat with me in the car for a good 30-45 minutes explaining every aspect of the car from technology to maintenance, etc...he was so thorough that even I was thinking ""ok already"".  haha! He even sent the car back to detailing because there were a few pieces of lint in the trunk! But I appreciated that he didn't have to take that much time with me yet he did. I would recommend this dealer and especially Beshoy!",5

We do not like being given the hard sell and Michael's down-to-earth, easygoing manner put us at ease and made us feel like we were dealing with not with a typical car salesman put a smart, nice guy who happens to sell cars. His lack of pushiness very much worked in his favor. The way it ended up working is that we were very close to buying the Audi A3 (Michael had gone out of his way to track down the one we wanted and taken us on more than one test drive) but ultimately decided it was too small. He did not give us a hard time or make us feel bad. After a several more weeks of looking around, we went back to Michael and bought a pre-owned A4. Though we obviously didn't base our decision on the salesman, we were glad to be able to return to Michael. He was very helpful and knowledgeable throughout the actual purchase transaction and we would highly recommend him to anyone. ",5

He took us on a long test drive.  Not pressuring on if we wanted to purchase the vehicle or not.  This dealership offered us the lowest price on the vehicle and the lowest interest rate around.

I  emailed  Phelan to tell him how upset I was that the car was not there, when I had taken 2 hours out of my work day to drive to Pasadena to see it. He did not respond to my email.  After a day, I called him and he was very unapoligetic and said ""ïf the car is not sold, I will call you back"".  He called three days later to say the car was still available.

It was conveniently close to my work, and this is the only reason I went there. I am a young female, and  I don't know a whole lot about cars. But I am definitely NOT a sucker, which is what I felt like 1 minute into being there.

Right off the bat, Johnny, one of the service techs starts telling me how its going to be SO EXPENSIVE. He was talking so fast telling me ""oh it's going to be 160 just to look at this and 200 just to look at that plus repairs, its going to be very expensive."" Ok Johnny, first of all, you don't even know what is wrong with my car, dont start barking these huge numbers at me. Don't they teach you how to talk to people??  He made me feel extremely uncomfortable and already felt like I was being taken advantage of. He wouldn't listen to anything I had to say, seemed like he was just trying to get me in and out and take as much money as he could.  I expressed a little concern to him about everything he was saying and the way he wasn't listening to me. He responds with ""well I gotta eat"". um what?! I've never been a part of a dealership that treated me this way. Long Beach Circle Audi and Santa Monica Audi are light years ahead of this place. Never again will I go there.

When we got there everything that we had discussed on the phone and via email was exactly as our salesman, Michael, said it was going to be. When your dealing with car salesmen it is so refreshing when you know you are dealing with someone you can trust and sticks to their word. All my paperwork was prepared a head of time so the whole process from start to finish took a little over an hour, which was amazing!

Quickness aside, this dealer guy comes and tells me that I should get an automatic!! I lost my words. He was saying that if I drive like I do, automatic is way better because it shifts faster.

We emailed back and forth with Michael P, who was nice and told him we'd come on Sunday. He was busy with a client, so we were passed to John, who after two minutes got too busy and passed us to Samy, who did a quick test run and was very busy, rushing us out.
After writing my report on this dealership here, got a message from Michael B.
I believe he is really trying to change the Rusnak Audi Pasadena to the standards of his previous place - Rusnak Volvo ( the great place and people to work with).

After some discussions I think we are in good hands. John Ashley is very helpful now.
We need to decide if we buy this Audi or Volvo.

Best luck to Michael Bradford with changing the culture at this place to more friendly.
It is probably location in the middle of rich Pasadena hood, which spoils his personnel a bit. ",4.2

We went all through the parking lot looking for a car I could drive with Navigation and Leather.  It seemed like he didn't know where any of the cars were located.  We walked from car to car and tried to help the sales person find the car I was to test drive.

When we realized that there were no A4 cars with the luxury package, we went all the way back to secure keys to where other cars are kept.

I kid you not, 15 minutes passed and he still hadn't come back with the car.  I was so fed up with the lack of organization and sloppy service, we left and vowed never to come back to this dealership.

Our excellent experience has been attributable to Ehprem and Nathaniel J on the showroom floor as well as Henry for our service needs.  The start to finish buying experience has been easy and enjoyable, resulting in the subsequent purchase of an A6 Avant, TT-S and my current '11 S4.

As soon as we arrived, we were greeted by a friendly salesman by the name of Emin Noorijan.  I explained the situation and what car we were in the market for.  He gladly took us to his office so we could discuss the options.  We found the right car in the end, thanks to Emin.  He is a very competent and knowledgeable individual, yet he manages to explain the complex details of the cars in an easy to understand manner.  In slow times, it wouldn't be surprising if a salesman was cutthroat, pushy and in a hurry to move to the next sale.  Emin, however, exhibits none of these pitfalls.  He understood how excited I was to be getting my first car, and it seemed that he too was excited for me, rather than just to make a sale.  If you are in the market for an Audi, I recommend Rusnak Pasadena, due to their bright employees and friendly atmosphere.  ",5
709,31-Jul-11,"Everyone knows that buying a new car can be a tedious process especially if you are trading in a car.  But I can honestly say hand down that my experience purchasing a carat Rusnak Audi was wonderful.  From the moment I was even interested in purchasing an Audi, Emin was the best sales person ever.  Hands down he was so friendly, and helpful.  At times I asked so many questions and wasn't sure at times about purchasing the car, and not once did he ever pressure me into buying the car.  He made himself completely available, and was straight forward with me.  He knew how much I was willing to pay and gave me a straight up number (no let me crunch some numbers or check with my manager trick that you get at some dealerships).  When it came to trading in my car as well, it was a great experience.

After I purchased my car, let me tell you, John Edwards was AMAZING!!!!  I have never seen someone so knowledgeable and friendly.  After the buying process was complete, John went over everything in my car.  He showed me features that I didn't even know existed with the car.  I must admit I was like a kid in a candy store, it was so refreshing to see someone actually take the time (he really took his time, he spent at least 45 minutes) to explain things to you and make sure all of your questions were answered.

It doesn't stop there.  After I left, I still received follow-up emails and phone calls from John making sure that everything was ok with my car and if I had any questions at all.  I have to say hands down that this was the first time in my life that I actually had a ""fun"" while purchasing my car.  The environment was relaxed and stress-free.  I can say that I am truly a customer for life.  I will buy all my future cars from Rsunak Audi, as well as refer all of my friends and family there.",5

I never felt rushed and was taken care of from the minute I drove into the dealership.

Secondly, Gladys was very nice in financing.  Rusnak is a great place to purchase thanks to the staff they have there.  The buildings are not fancy like most Audi dealorships, but perhaps they don't update so they save and not put the cost onto the buyers and pressure their salesmen to sell sell sell.

720,20-Jun-11,"
After an exhaustive search of all major Audi dealerships in the Southern CA area I found an excellent dealership at Rusnak Audi.  Furthermore, Emin provided superb service.  A few examples of why Emin and Rusnak were terrific: 

1.  Emin was very responsive when answering my inquiries regarding new and used cars that the dealership had in inventory.  His follow-up and prompt replies were without peer in comparison to the other Audi dealerships. 

2.  There is no hard-sell at Rusnak Audi.  My girlfriend and I had an enjoyable experience with all their service members--there was no pressure to ""buy today"".  

3.  Emin was very patient on our test drives (we test drove two vehicles), and was very open regarding the differences of various models.  He wanted to inform, rather than push a sale. 

4.  Upon agreeing upon a purchase price, Emin ensured that we received proper paperwork and had all the necessary materials. 

5.  When our new car was ready, Emin took over 20 minutes to walk us through all the functions of the vehicle (i.e. the navigation system, the climate controls, etc.).  The first-hand tutorial was invaluable for a ""quick-start"".  The care he took for us to learn about the controls was outstanding. 

Overall, a very positive experience working with Emin and the Rusnak team.  I highly recommend.  ",5

Everything was perfect but sooner or later you need the bad news of how much it is going to cost.  Even then Maties , along with the floor manager, continued with excellent service .  I would recommend your dealership as well as Maties.
Thank you and I love the car

726,10-Jun-11,"I recently leased a 2010 Audi A6 from Rusnak Audi in Pasadena, CA. I have leased several cars in the past and been pleased with my experience. However, my experience at Rusnak Audit was remarkable. My sales representative's loyal, friendly and diligent disposition enabled me to successfully finalize my lease with them. After the sale Emin has frequently followed up with me to ensure I am pleased with my vehicle and in addition, every time I have taken my car inn for service, Emin has ensured all my concerns are rectified in a efficient and timely manner. I will indeed recommend prospective buyers to Rusnak Audi and in particular advise them to work with Emin Noorijanian. ",5
727,10-Jun-11,"Provided comprehensive review of the vehicle and giving their pros and cons to what they think.  Friendliest customer service and treat you with every respect they could have.  Also, they would consider the best pricing option they could offer comparing with other dealership.  ",5
728,08-Jun-11,"""My fiance and I had a great experiance at Rusnak Audi Pasadena"".  We were in the market for a new A4 so I reached out to the Internet Manager (Emin Noorijanian).  Emin couldn't of been more helpful.  He made the intire process extremly easy and stress free.  We ended up with the car we wanted and at a price that was extremly fair.  If you are in the market for a new or used Audi I would highly recommend Emin Noorijanian at Rusnak Audi in Pasadena. ",4.8
729,05-Jun-11,"Alex and all of those at Rusnak Audi in Pasadena, CA were very professional and respectful during the process. Because of their passion for excellence, they made my car buying experience a memorable one. Alex Sirani was very informative about each vehicle and very honest and straight-forward. Since this was my first car purchase, I wanted to make the right decision. I left Rusnak Audi and looked at other dealerships. But while at other dealerships, the only car I was thinking about was the 2011 Audi A4 Premium that Alex had shown me. When I began comparing every car I was test-driving to the Audi A4, I knew my decision was made. I went back to Rusnak Audi and Alex worked with me to lease the new 2011 Audi A4. To this day, It was one of the best choices I have made. ",5
730,31-Jul-06,"Purchased a new Audi A4 over Father's Day and only one month of owning the car I had to call the service department to get an appointment to bring in the car because at each stop it would sputter and act like it would die.  Waited 15 minutes to check in and when a service consultant finally started to write up the service request when I mentioned that I had spoke to JOHN earlier he stopped the check-in process and told me I had to go direct to John.  After an additional 15 minutes I finally got checked in with John and then sent to a car rental location to get my ""loaner"" car.  I waited an hour and a half to finally get into a car that was a gas guzzler and absolutely filthy.  As of today, they have had my car for one week and each time I want an update or information, I have to call.  They first thought it was one part of the transmission (after 2 days) but after 5 days they found out they were wrong and again they have ""gone back to Audi Tech"" to find out what tests they should run, blah, blah, blah.

I purchased a $45,000 car in June and am currently driving a $7,000 car with no power windows/locks/etc.  From my conversations with John and Chris, apparently I am not being patient enough with them and they could care less about what I am driving as a ""loaner"".  THIS SERVICE DEPARTMENT IS TOTALLY INCOMPETENT AND I WILL NEVER BRING MY CAR TO THEM.  I WILL ALSO TELL ANYONE I KNOW NOT TO PURCHASE A CAR FROM THEM EITHER AS I WAS PROMISED BY MY SALESMAN THAT THIS SERVICE DEPARTMENT WAS TOP NOTCH!!!!

731,29-Jul-06,"car broke down after 3 weeks service manager and service peo[ple do not know anything thing about our car, they promised to have it fixed in one day , then the next day , now they don""t know when or how to fix it. they are the worst service i have e ver seen. do not buy a car from rusnak pasadena , i put 27,000 ollars down and ended up driving a ford focus instead of the car i  .   purschased "" the lemon law should also apply to service people who keep your car with no resolution insight on how to fix it. rusnak should revamp his service department if he was smart. but as you can see he condones such incompentance in his dealership, when i get my money back i will buy a bmw where service counts and they treat you with respect.",1
732,10-May-06,"If you can avoid servicing your car at Rusnak, then do so. We bought a new car that came with 2 years of free services and HAD to go to Rusnak.  They then made their money back by charging for all sorts of unknowns and the labor was insanely expensive.  We are now awaiting a possible settlement for faulty diagnosis on oru ingnition system that they insisted needed replacement.  They make all their money on repairs!!!!",1.2
733,14-Sep-05,"Beware of Rusnak.  Chris Aldworth is in charge of the Rusnak service dept and he was totally unresponsive.  My Audi TT 225 with 39k has been in the shop over 30 times!!!  You would think someone would look at my service history and offer to get involved to fix this vehicle.

About every 1 - 2k a new problem surfaces.  Many of which, were repaired previously at Rusnak.  Just a few from my very long list...
- Drivers Side Air Bag (warning light on/air bag replaced)
- Passenger Side Air Bag (warning light on/air bag replaced)
- Fuel pump (car stalled - replaced)
- Temp Warning Light - (sensor replaced)
- Alternator & battery replaced
- Instrument cluster replaced
- Gas Tank senor replaced
And, lots, lots more.....

Worst of all, my warranty ran out in December & now Audi claims no responsibility for repeated and/or prior problems.

Bottom line - I will NEVER buy any vehicle from Rusnak!!!!!!!!!

734,11-Mar-04,"This dealership is called an ""auto group"" because the same company on the same lot has several other high end car brands,  Porsche, Bentley...etc.   We were serious about purchasing an ""factory ordered"" car.  We knew exactly what we wanted and the ordering process was carefull and clearly explained.  The car was delivered in about three months (about the time they estimated), exactly what we ordered and in perfect condition.   Perhaps this isn't the place you want to haggle and penny pinch.  Our experiences with other Audi  ""LA area"" dealers could take up pages.  Rusnak Pasadena was more business-like and provided the best new car purchasing experience we've had since...... 1989.    The parts department was very helpful, the car has yet to have it's first oil change so I haven't experienced the service department.    Overall, we are glad we purchased from Rusnak Pasadena and would buy from them again.",4.5
