0,"April 16, 2020","Terrible experience. Had to return a leased car and wanted to purchase another advertised on their website. Walk in sales closed due to pandemic but website made a big deal about being able to order online but I wanted to speak with someone about potential offers listed on the site. Got online and did their chat system and was told someone would call....no response. Did it again...no response. Called to coordinate drop off of the leased car and passed along my message that I was interested in a purchase and was told that the sales manager who was still working would call me back...no response.  Took the car in yesterday and dropped it off. While I was doing that, the wife went around to the sales lot and spoke with another customer who actually took a test drive and then went inside to purchase a truck. We asked if we could just purchase as we knew what car we wanted (having turned in the same model from the lease) but we were told they weren't going to sell any more cars. When asked why the other customer was able to purchase, we were told only ""special"" customers were allowed. ""special"" should mean customers who want to purchase their products. Done with this dealer. ",1.0

16,"September 21, 2019",I come to Kuni now for my last two vehicles. They don’t pressure you and they BS you. They are helpful and get you the best deal. The only thing I will say is the car took forever in detail and when driving home I noticed the windshield has dried on water spots that won’t come off easily. Also black smudge on one of the doors. This is all cosmetic so not the end of the world. ,4.8

This letter serves to express my sincere appreciation for the outstanding sales service you have given me and my family throughout all of my four car purchase transactions dating back from 2008.On each of our transactions throughout the years, I reflect back and think of how easy each transaction was that you facilitated. Your professional demeanor, attention to detail, and exceptional service is what makes me keep coming back to Select Kuni Chevrolet but more importantly why I call you ""FIRST"" with my car requests.

I am enjoying the recent purchase of my Lexus ES 350 and my wife as well. I look forward to doing business with you again in the future. I wouldn't consider going to a different dealership or working with any other sales professional as you. Thanks again for being my trusted car advisory, always assessing me and my family needs accurately, exceeding my expectations and delivering on your promises.

Sincerely,
Freeman Family

44,"April 08, 2019","I dropped by Kuni not intending to buy a new car but Oleg took me on a test drive and showed all the functions and features I've been missing out on. It didn't take long for me to fall in love with a 2019 Corvette Stingray. Robert and I negotiated long and hard and struck a deal I could accept. Ron introduced me to the prepaid maintenance plan (plus) and the benefit of paying for 7.5 years of maintenance in today's dollars. Overall, very good sales department. I highly recommend Kuni!",4.8
45,"April 06, 2019","Kuni is a first class dealership with a large selection of high end automobiles. Our sales consultant, Dave Forget is one of the nicest sales people you’ll ever meet. He was polite and didn’t pressure our purchase. He was good at following up with phone calls and keeping us informed. ",4.6
46,"April 03, 2019"," Trying to accomplish anything on the phone with the dealership has always resulted in my giving up and going into the store. This usually results. Because I am transferred to voice mail and my calls have NEVER been returned.   It’s as if you do business without telephone service. This should really be “looked at” from your end.  All else has been excellent and I do recommend your dealership frequently.  Get the phones answered and return calls when asked and you’ve got it totally made!

61,"February 20, 2019","I purchased a vehicle from Kuni Chevrolet Cadillac of Sacramento on 02/16/2019. I first spotted the car for me on their website. The website is very user friendly, and once I placed my information into their system for more details of the vehicle, I received an email from their customer engagement coordinator letting me know my many options and information about the dealership. I then called and spoke with Clarence, the sales associate. He was very informative, friendly, and excited to show me the vechile that upcoming weekend. Clarence went to work for me in regards to helping me get the exact price and APR that I was seeking. While waiting we talked about family, sports, and had many laughs along the way. What I  admired most about Clarence was that he was honest, to the point and looked out for my best interest. I highly recommend this dealership.

68,"February 04, 2019","They ordered the wrong parts for our new truck 3 different times, put off getting our side steps installed for almost 4 months, and have horrible communication skills. We purchased our truck back in OCTOBER. When purchasing it, we paid for side steps that we wanted on our truck. They said they'd call when they came in. At the time they said it might be up to a month. On December, we called to check on them and they told us they had nothing there under our name. We called back again and were told they did have them. So we made an appointment for 2 weeks later to have them installed and the truck detailed as promised (since the truck we purchased was never detailed). We took the day off of work to drive up there early in the morning (the dealership is 2 hours from our home) and have the work done. We sat there from 9am until 4pm when we recieved a call saying that the parts they had for our truck were for the WRONG truck. We were obviously upset, considering we had been sitting there ALL day and NOTHING had been done with our truck. We were told there was nothing they could do except order the correct parts and make an appointment for the following weekend. So we did that and made an appointment for the following Saturday. On Friday evening, we hadn't heard anything confirming the parts had come in and the appointment was still on, so we called Josh (the sales manager we've been working with) and he said he ""had his hands on the parts"" and they were the right ones for our truck. Since being inconvenienced so many times at this point, they said they would come pickup our truck from us, leave us a loaner, and take our truck to get the work done. I was also told the work they were doing would most likely be finished in one day, the same day they picked the truck up from us. So the truck was picked up at 11:45am Friday. By 2:45pm on SATURDAY we still hadn't heard anything. We had to call them again to get an update on the work and an ETA of our truck. Josh informed us 45 minutes later that the parts they had for our truck were SCRATCHED and they couldn't install them!! They said they couldn't order the parts until Monday and now we're looking at our truck sitting at the dealership all week. Being upset, I tried calling the dealership to speak with another sales manager named Eddy that I had spoken with the previous week. I was told he was busy and would call me back when he had time. I tried asking for any other manager I could speak with and was told they weren't available. I then tried calling Josh back and he wouldn't answer my calls. I literally couldn't get ahold of anyone to figure out what was going on. So I called the service department to figure out what was done on the truck and what exactly was scratched. It was then that I was told the parts that came in were not scratched but they were parts for the wrong truck AGAIN! What the xxxx!!! I couldn't believe it. At this point, I felt like I was lied to and honestly was sick and tired of dealing with the dealership any more! I called the dealership again asking for Josh and was told that he would call me back. He called me back almost 2 hours later. I confronted him about the 2 different stories and he had nothing to say. It was at this point I told him that I wanted my truck driven back to me the next day (Sunday) and wanted the work they were going to do (install steps and emblems, full detail, as well as fil up the def and gas tanks) done at the Chevy dealership by my house and I know longer trusted them to work on my truck. He said he would have to talk to some higher ups to get the ""okay"" and he would get back to me. MONDAY at 3:45pm someone pulls up to my house with my truck. I recieved no phone call saying he got it okayed or that they would be bringing our truck back. They had done NOTHING with our truck in the over 72 hours they had our truck. They couldn't even detail it!! I am BEYOND upset with this ""business."" I would NEVER recommend this place!!!",1.0

105,"November 17, 2018","Once I purchased my car, I felt the staff at this dealership washed their hands of me. I did not feel valued because of the way I was treated. 

1)They told me I could not pay off my car loan until after 3 months with GM Financial. False. GM Financial told me there was no prepayment penalty. The dealership claimed no knowledge of this after I told them what I found out.

2) I asked for my maintenance plan to be removed from my account. It was not done. GM Financial said Ron, who was our finance person, did not submit a cancellation. I could never get a hold of him. My emails, voicemails and calls went unanswered. I had to get my salesperson to locate him for me at one point. The general sales manager helped me after multiple calls to several of his staff.  Not only did Ron omit certain information from us when explaining the plan, he then didn't even apologize for not cancelling the plan when he said he would, and for not replying to any of my messages. He lacks professionalism and basic courtesy. 

Their website touts phenomenal service. Between being put on hold for 12+ minutes at one point to then being passed from person to person without any solutions to my issues was a really stressful experience. They lacked transparency and organization with my car sale. I came away in the end frustrated and not valued.",1.4

And we both show up for the same time frustrated and angry.  We were there first so we got to test drive. But another dealer realizing this raced to sell it to her while we were doing so. I even made it most of the way through the purchase paperwork having already put down my sensitive personal information when they informed me. I mean really who treats their customers with this much contempt and disdain. Ruined our Saturday driving all the way out to sacramento.  No respect for our time, or the gas wasted getting there. We load our three year old into the car preparing to drive away, and they send some manager out to smooth things over, and it's not long before he's insinuating that I lied that they were holding the car for us. At any point they could have behaved like adults and wrote it off as a miscommunication, but they kept doubling down on treating both and me and this other lady like xxxx.

My Silverado 1500 was on delivered on o4/28/18 with grease on front & back seats because someone in the service dept. did not use a protective barrier and nobody checked it before delivery. The inside also had dirt on the door panels & floor. Most importantly, I only received one key & fob for the vehicle (supposed to receive two), the second set is missing. Nobody seems to care that I did not receive the second key & fob. Luke, a sales manager, makes excuses & was rude to me when I called him about it. Felix, my sales person, said he may have taken it home & now doesn't return my calls. Although I was called repeatedly to complete the purchase paperwork, since I signed the documents nobody returns my calls and voice mail messages. There is an unaccounted-for key & fob that can be used to steal my vehicle & the grease on the seats has not been fully cleaned. I just keep getting blown off on these issues.

374,"October 19, 2016","So i originally was asked By my salesman to give a riches right then and there, actually asked me severally times before leaving with my car if I went back and approved the review in my email. Very eager. But now I'm giving my real review. I don't feel like Terrance really cared about my experience at all or my satisfaction with the car or my satisfaction with the transaction. I was withheld from the information that my car had a delinquent notice on it , I understand negligence of the law is no excuse however they new I was from out of state and would have no idea how the registration process in California worked. I was just rencently slapped with a $500 registration fee which was hidden within the paperwork I signed while I was so excited to be receiving a new car. Terrance was more worried about what he was getting for lunch than he was about my understanding of how the car worked or how my sale would unfold. I had to fight tooth and nail for a second key I was verbally promised, which I did receive. He never once followed up with me to see how I liked my car but they were sure to call my boyfriend who bought a newer Cadillac that same day. Very disappointed with this dealership as a whole thus far. The only decent person I've come across there was rich the salesman I originally was interested in doing business with and jackelyn in the service department is very customer oriented and nice.

John and Veronica McMurdie have purchased Cadillac's for decades.
Veronica McMurdie currently owns a 2008 Cadillac, and traded-in a 2001 Cadillac.

April 6, 2016 - John McMurdie, age 87, purchases a 2009 Toyota Camry, SE for $11,595. 

August 4, 2016 - John McMurdie, dies.

August 23, 2016, we took the Toyota Camry in and got an offer to purchase the same used car from Kuni motors for $7,000 after their inspection.

Purchase Date:  04/06/2016       Owned for: 4 months 17 days.

Odometer at Purchase:  64,377   Odometer at Offer:  67027 
Miles driven:   2,650

Purchase Price:  $ 11,595.         Gross Profit:  $ 5,000.     assuming $6,500 ""cash value""

Kuni Used car offer:  $ 7,000.	        Kelly Blue Book ""Cash Price"":   $ 6,200.
Loss in 4.5 months:  - $ 4,595.     - 40%

Kuni already made $ 5,000 from the 1st sale to John McMurdie.
They will make another $ 4,000 selling the same used car.

------------------

Kuni should buy the car back for at least $9,000.
They will have made a profit of $2,595.

When they sell the car again for $11,595, they will make another $2,595.

Needless to say, we will never buy a vehicle from Kuni and we are telling all of our friends and bridge club members to STAY AWAY from Kuni.",1.4

400,"August 05, 2016","Kung charged me for items that weren't broken. I also never got the parts back that were removed from my vehicle. They played this game of changing parts to see if anything changed with my vehicle. The second time I drove off from their facility after paying a total of almost $700 Kuni still hadn't fixed my problem. Prior to me driving off each time I showed the tech adviser Gary that the problem wasn't fixed but that they had no problem swiping my card. I was having a difficult time understanding why they would give me my vehicle back without correcting the problem. It became obvious to me that I needed to challenge the integrity of the dealership at this point. The service department failed miserably here. The service advisor was embarrassed and advised me that he was going to try to get me my money back. I advised him I paid to have my car fixed thats all I wanted. Why are you guys giving me my car back after not fixing it. Completly upset with this, I took my car to to a friends dealership @ BMW Roseville where the tech there (Rocky) found the problem in less than 5 five minuets. Needless to say I was fuming after Rocky found the problem. I had also noticed that Rocky was quite embarrassed by my situation. When I asked him why he looked embarrassed he replied to me "" the Kuni tech should have been able to find this issue without much problem...this is a pretty easy fix."" On my way back to Sacramento I called the service advisor and service manager to complain and set up my final meeting with Kuni. The service tech (Gary Goings) apologized to me but the service manager, Vince Cortez was a on the phone asking me repeatedly, ""What do you want us to do, fix your car for free?"" I asked him to look harder and he might notice that I've paid almost  $700. He said that he had read all of the invoices and had spoken to the service tech and all he could do for me was to give me my money back. I told him not to worry about getting my money back I can handel that myself without his help. It was apparent to me the he didn't have the juice to make the proper call regarding pissed off customers. I told him If he couldn't fix my car I got no use for him or the mechanic who thought he was fixing my vehicle. He had no answer for the tech in Roseville who found the problem in less than 5 minuets. I told him I will be seeing his boss tomorrow so he might want to read the work  orders again to be familiar with this case. The next day I called the GM and asked to speak with her and her service manager about this problem. The GM invited me to come in a tell them what happened. When I sat down in the office of the Service Director I soon realized that I had not spoken to the service director at all over this matter  (yet another layer of protection). He didn't act surprised by my complaint which leads me to believe that this maybe a normal occurrence here. I have never experienced this behavior before at this location and I have lived down the street from them  since the 80's when Mike Daugherty owned the dealership. I was a customer then but now I will go to out of the arear for any more services for this vehicle. Kuni kept my car for a total of 7 days total and only fixed my car after I showed the service manager where the problem was located. The service director finally decided to ""start over"" as he called it. He got tired of hearing me berate the service department. He said would put his senior technician on this. They would give me one hour free to diagnose the problem. I told him it shouldn't be a problem as I will show Vince where the issue is located. The final straw on this caper came when the service manger looked me dead in the face and said he would call me after the hour is up to let me know whats up. Four hours after leaving my vehicle there and after showing Vince myself where the problem was he had nerve to call me to tell me ""I found your problem.""  I was so pissed off I wanted to reach through the phone. and slap him for being an idiot. However, I remained silent knowing they still need to fix my ride. After a long pause he said ""I'm going to fix it for free"". The next day they kept my vehicle for the entire day and called me to pick it up at the end of the day. What a bunch of knuckleheads. The service manager was obviously getting back at me for insulting his intelligence and making them look bad This took almost 2 months to get right. Brought my car in on the 16th of May and got it fixed July 16th.  This dealership is in dire need of some help. Since my last visit I was told by a friend that the GM is gone....now if they could just fix the service dept.  Vince needs to get more training on service and go to charm school to learn how to deal with customers. The Director of the service department needs to retire. He obviously was not happy to see me and due to his poorly run service department he couldn't back their play because they screwed up big time. All he could do was tell me that my vehicle had many issues and after 41 years in the business he knows what he is talking about. He said that I should have been charged separately for each issue that my vehicle was having. They should have charged me $150 per hour to look at several differs things and they are not related. This is where I had a problem with him. $450 just to look at the problem. I told him that all of the issues were related and that for him to say that they were not was ridiculous. This was obviously a way for Kuni to run the bill up.  In the end once the vehicle was fixed all of the other so-called non related issues stopped. Imagine that. Bunch of money hungry losers...Corporate needs to fix this place! Corporate, feel free to contact me if you have any question about this. By the way Kuni needs to STOP putting ""world class vehicle inspections"" on their work orders. It makes the customer pissed off and makes Kuni look bad, especially when the customers realizes nothing has been fixed. ",1.0
401,"August 05, 2016","OK so if you are a buyer looking for a car, do not come to the Chevrolet dealer on Fulton!!!!!! First, I was trading in my car for a new car which I thought was perfectly fine. A great gentleman by the name of John Meyer helped me out with this. It was smooth sailing until I had to pay $2000 for a down payment. So I did and I was also told that wells Fargo had picked up my loan. So the next couple of weeks are great. I have a new car everything is wonderful, until I get a TEXT, not a call, from one of the women working there. So she tells me I'm going to have to put an extra 1200 to keep the car. I'm like excuse me, keep in mind I've already signed paperwork for this car so it is definitely mine. She proceeds to tell me that the bank ALLY needed more money. I'm like well I'm with wells Fargo, or at least that's what she told me. She said no you must be confused you are with ALLY. So she basically lied about everything so I had to put more money down. The thing is though, I just told them to give me my old car back then because putting down 3200 for a 24 year old is really hard. They refused to give me my car back and proceeded to try to work out a deal with me, which should have been done when I signed the paperwork the first time!!!!!!!!!!

Expecting my car to be ready, I called later that afternoon to check on the status of the repairs.  The phone service at Kuni is horrible.  I was bounced around and told I needed to speak to the person assigned to my vehicle to get an update.  I had to leave a message and call back numerous times until I was finally able to get a hold of the service person around 5pm.   I was then informed my car would NOT be ready that day and that he would call me the next morning with an update.  I was offered a rental car which I then needed to make last minute arrangements to go get before Enterprise closed at 6pm!  I never received a call the next day (Friday).  I even followed up Friday around noon and had to leave another message.  I never received a phone call back.  I waited all weekend for a phone call and update.  I had to call again Monday morning and still had not received a response.  I did not get a call back until Monday afternoon informing me they had to order a part for my car and that it MAY be done that evening.  Since there were no guarantees it would be done that evening, I asked for them to keep it until the next day so they could ensure it was complete and I could arrange things with the rental company as well during their working hours.

The car buying experience was a little long,  but I was expecting that. The sales manager kept trying to address my boyfriend when it came down to negotiating a price even though I was purchasing the vehicle. However,  Dave was honest and helpful throughout the process.

I don't care if you don't usually sell X, Y, or Z makes, but you are selling one to me now. Do a 3-minute Google search, research the vehicle and owner requirements for that brand and guide me, the new owner who's paying you. Nearly 5 months later, I was still not updated with that brand's driver care program and not-yet-expired warranty coverage -- which has now caused several problems trying to get scheduled for regular service. (Also apparently I was not updated on some national dealer sales database either -- for a paid-in-full purchase?). The frustrating part, I tried to get registered online, and every time I asked a question from my seller I heard: ""I don't know, we don't sell that make."" Again, I say you are selling it to me now. All I needed was general instructions on taking over a used car: call that number, register here, etc. I just got a decent CarMax appraisal, so maybe I will unload this and get something else so I don't have to think about this experience anymore.

One of your guys (do not know his name) tells me please move your vehicle to this bay, that is for the out going vehicles, So I moved my vehicle to the other bay,  Another guy asked me what I was in for, I said service and repairs, he asked me if a had an appointment, I said no, You will need to make an appointment for repairs. I brought my vehicle for repairs knowing that you may not even have the parts but we need to find out the issue first, so instead of so much resistant to your clients. I will think your service writers or whoever those two guys were,  should be more like, great to see you today, How could we help you today, So you have repairs, lets find out what is wrong and then we could schedule for repairs. That would be so much easy to digest from the beginning. 
After all this I got to talk to Eric about my experiences already, he has good customer service skills, anyway we got to talk about free car wash and I was happy to get it since my Denali is very dirty.  
Ok all service gets done, I get a call that my car is ready.  While I was paying I asked Eric if they wash the car, he already had someone getting the car and radio him to check if the car was washed, 10 minutes later waiting for the car we found that it was not washed at this point I was very unhappy for two reasons, if you tell your customer you will do something and you dont do it, your satisfactions is not good, I mentioned to Eric that he should not tell customers your vehicle is ready, and wait for last minute while the customer is there to wash the car.  We all have things to do and places to be, I dont have time to wait for that, especially since you had the car for 3 days.  
Now lets talk about your repairs.  I had you guys replaced the passenger window switch. You guys replaced it but failed to put my door panels in the same way they were.  They are loose and they are not fitted correctly.  
I guess is my fault for keep bringing my vehicle to service to your dealership since this happened before with other repairs, I have not been very impressed with your work and sometimes your customer service.
One time before I showed your service writer that my driver door is all scratched inside and it was not like that before I brought it to you, and I was told that your guys did not do it.  
Another time my car was leaking oil after your company did an oil changed, I brought my car to your  oil lube department and mentioned to the service writer that my car is leaking and that it was not leaking before I brought it, I know for fact since my driveway is fairly new, 
After few minutes I was told that my steering system was leaking and it had nothing to do the oil changed, I told him that it was not possible, I checked it my self and your mechanic was wrong, I was told that your Master tech is the one that checked it.  So I asked them to show it to me. So we went down the pit and he showed me the leak, yes it looked like the steering was leaking but he fail to check that the oil filter was in top of the steering dripping oil to it. So they replaced the oil filter and I went home.
Here are some experiences with your company.  Now I have to bring my car back to fix my rear door panels before they come off.



Anyway I had to show your Master Technician that the oil filter was left loose. The correct the issue and then

Darin, the guy I worked with, did manage to have the oil change done before I came to pick the car up at 6.   While Darin tried to be as helpful as possible, it was obvious to me that he was simply the messenger and the problem lies further up the food chain.  Why?  Because this isn't the first time this has happened.  My heater went out over the winter and they kept my car for more than two weeks while they were ""trying to get the part"" - on a car that is only a year and a half old?   I had to call the national Chevy Volt hotline people involved to finally get this fixed.

Clearly, this is a service department that doesn't want to do warranty work and/or needs better management.  Either way, they should not schedule service when they don't have the capability of getting it done on time.  ",3.5

447,"June 30, 2016","My story goes like this.

I called because I knew that I needed a new alternator or car battery asap but was not scheduled to be seen until 48 hours later. I expressed my urgency at all times to the front desk by phone and was habitually transferred to the service department where nobody answered the phone and I had to leave multiple messages. 

After calling and talking to multiple reps I found that my car battery was not covered by my warranty and I decided to buy a new battery and install it myself at a local Autozone. 

Then, my alternator completely dies the next day and when I called for help finding a tow truck it took 3 different representatives at the front desk to finally advise me to call a different agency when I was lead to believe that Kuni would arrange all the leg work for finding me a tow truck company that could work with my vehicles make and model to tow it to KUNI. 

After 3-4 hours waiting in 100 degree weather trying to establish a tow to KUNI the service department was closed and I had to leave my powerless vehicle overnight in the front of the service departments parking lot. 

I was never offered a loaner vehicle or informed that that was even a possibility during all my contacts nor the next day when my car was at KUNI, I also had to call to follow up once my car was at KUNI and after 2 long days the alternator was replaced free of charge but only because of my warranty.

I took the car home without realizing that the technicians never even bothered to put the cap back on my battery that is located in my rear seat when they checked to see if the problem was with my battery after I had told them that I replaced the battery before I even took it in. 

I had to then take the time and screw the battery cap back in place. 

Overall I was not pleased with the whole experience and felt frustrated from beginning to end.  

The interesting part about all of this is that I've been dealing with KUNI for over a year and this is the first time that I have been truly displeased with their service. 

I hope this an anomaly and not the norm moving forward.     ",2.0

459,"June 23, 2016","I came to Kuni in hopes to find a reliable car. The first day that I went in, the bank that Kuni was attempting to go through would not accept our offer after all the wonderful help from Angela Ivey. We received a call the next day with great news that one of the banks came through due to Kuni working with me, I was beyond excited. We drove away in a newer car after trading in my old car, there was an annoying squeak in the car when backing up and Kuni told us to just make an appointment to come back in to get it checked out. We made the appointment a few days later in the service department. When we took the car in, they told us that it would be a few hours that we would be seen even though we had an appointment and that it would be a $50 deductible to get anything fixed. We had to wait a whole week to even get another appointment. During this time, we were driving the car, I received a call regarding a discrepancy in the contract and eventually came to terms. When we took the car in for the re-scheduled appointment, they kept the car overnight without any notice, rental car, or any accommodation, I had to continuously call to get an update and I did not even get to speak with the service advisor assigned to my car. When we planned on going to get the car, they told me I could not get the car until we re-wrote the contract and put more money down. Kuni put me in a complete bind leaving me without a car for 2 full days! We finally went to Kuni and it took them 30 minutes to even tell me what is going on.  At this point, I requested my down payment and keys to my old car back. They told me a check would be ready the next day in the morning. We wasted a trip to their facility to find out the check was not ready nor did they have access to my title. I called to speak with a manager, Elizabeth, to get additional information about this confusion. I requested a call from her to let me know when the check would be ready and she refused to do so.

483,"June 07, 2016","Service was the usual experience. However, while checking in, I inquired about a loaner car and was told that the shuttle could take me to Enterprise. They should have loaner vehicles for their valued customers rather than sending us to a rental place. I had to get to work so I did not have time to go and rent a car, which was an inconvenience. Instead I had a family member taxi me around, which was also an inconvenience. We have purchased many vehicles here over the years.  We currently have a Corvette and a Cadillac.  We feel that we are loyal customers who should be treated with value.  Going to Enterprise would have added time and headache to the process of getting my vehicle repaired (not only to get the rental but also to return it). When I came to pick up my vehicle the next day I saw a car that said Kuni Loaner Vehicle on the side of it and a woman getting in and situated for her drive.  Why was she given a loaner but I was not?  Am I not valued as much as she is? I have purchased 2 Corvette's, 2 Chevy SUV's and a Cadillac over the last 25 years. Something this small may not seem like a big deal but it does not make someone feel ""valued"" nor does it make me eager to return to purchase more vehicles. My father took his car to Ford for repair and service and was given a loaner car. My friend is the service department manager at Infinity and they give loaner vehicles. Perhaps it is time to switch to a different dealer? 
As for Eric, he was friendly and professional.  My only complaint was the communication.  He told me he would call me by the end of the day.  I did not hear from him that day.  Around 9 am the following morning I called and left him a voice mail inquiring about the status.  He called me back shortly after I left the message.

I was called later in the afternoon and told that the mirror would be in the next morning could I leave my car overnight.  I agreed.  

The next day I called about noon to see why my car was not ready.  I was given a bunch of excuses and told they were working on it.  I informed them I needed my car.  An hour later I was called and told it would be ready in 15 minutes.

First, there was a leak somewhere in the ceiling of the car, plus my rear view camera was not working, The first time I took it to Kuni, they kept my car for almost 4 weeks. When I got my car back, there were screws missing from the roof rack, and the rear camera still did not work. The second time I took it in, they replaced the screws and the camera, but a few days later the camera failed to work again. The third time I took the car in, it was a Friday morning. I called them at 4:30 that afternoon to see if I could come pick up my car, and they told me that it hadn't been looked at yet. (Note: I made this appointment so they knew I was coming in that day.) I called them on Monday at 3:00 p.m., and was told it wouldn't be ready until the next day.
I shouldn't have to call at the end of each day for an update. I felt that every time I called for an update, it was an inconvenience for them to talk with me, much less call me back. Sometimes I would leave 2 to 3 messages before anyone called me back.
In the future, if I need any service repairs, or to purchase a new car, I will be going to a different dealership. Not Kuni.",1.6
492,"June 01, 2016","We wanted a Certified Used car and found a nice 2015 Malibu for under $15000.  This was the first time we returned to a dealer after buying another car from them last year.  Having non commissioned car sales people who don't pressure you to buy was very nice. We'll be back for our next car, as well.",4.8
493,"June 01, 2016","I brought my car in for a recall on Thursday May 26th and after it was completed I opened the hood before leaving Kuni's and found that one of the vacuum lines was broken.  I asked about it and they told me they would repair it for $58 which is the cost of the part to replace it.  I know the part is old but they were the ones that broke it.  I had looked at the engine prior to the recall and it wasn't broken then.

I have a 2001 impala and I have had to repair this part once before.  It was a stupid design and could have been much more simple and less costly to replace.  

I liked working with Eric, I think it was his manager who made the call not to fix the problem. I think they knew about the broken part and had made the decision not to repair it before I pointed it out to them.",1.6
494,"May 31, 2016","Recommend either dropping the diagnostic charge completely or giving a 50% discount should customer  proceed with the repair.  As a GM retiree, I will continue to use Kuni Cadillac to service my DeVille when the cost is not prohibitive.

520,"May 12, 2016","After dealing with a number of Chevrolet dealers (sent my requirements via email) Kuni's was the one dealer that stood out.  Their internet department was very service oriented and kept me abreast of statuses and current inventory.  Sales representative was very detail oriented and walked us through the entire vehicle before even mentioning #'s or paperwork.  Internal management assisted both my wife and I during the process and was willing to do what ever to make the deal happen.  He even assisted my wife in watching our two kids who eventually got to a point of losing it due to duration of the event.   They stayed after hours and ensured the entire car buying experience was a good one. I definitely recommend this location over Hanlee's in Davis where the lot is dirty, sales force it non-existent, and service department is corrupt. ",5.0

The turnaround time was quite long at over 3 hours but an optional shuttle/cleaning the car before giving it back to me helps.  I have purchased 2 caddy's from Hubacher (Kuni's predecessor) and this dealership has been fine other than trade in values and a high hourly rate (though I am sure competitive amongst dealership service centers).  Ed is a good service rep and I hope that they go back to dedicated service reps per client (not per visit).

I do not appreciate the fact that this is no longer a Cadillac exclusive dealership.  At least it is GMC and more importantly, and AMERICAN car dealership but it reduces the variety of used and new Caddy's that I see when I browse around the parking lot during service.  ",4.2
526,"May 09, 2016",Was told that my car was ready on my voicemail because I was dropped off at the mall by Kuni shuttle. The message left said car is done about to be washed and call for shuttle ride back. I met with a friend at the mall who gave me the ride back an hour after the message was left. I didn't answer the phone because I was in the movies. So when I returned to get my car I was told by another service clerk my car was just completed and if I wanted it washed it would be another 20 minutes. I'm like I was told on a voicemail it was finished and he said well they just finished it and come back and get it washed. Someone is not honest ,4.6

529,"May 05, 2016","Purchasing my vehicle at Kuni was a mistake and if I could do it over I would go elsewhere. The sales staff use unethical tactics to hide hidden fees and up-charge for items that I did not agree to. I spent two hours going back and forth with the sales manager, can't recall his name but he was very tall...like 6'8"" tall. Even though we both agreed upon a price as he put it""The GM would not approve it"". What is the point of agreeing on a price if you do not have the authority to close on it? Then the game starts all over again. Finally we come to an agreement on a higher price only to find out when I am in the finance department completing paperwork,  that they have added a $600 LoJack to the purchase price without informing me. The Finance Manager attempted to rationalize it  by stating, ""what charges are above the bottom line are irrelevant as long as the overall cost is what was agreed upon"". The logic of that statement is beyond ridiculous. To that end here is the actual bottom line...DO NOT BUY A CAR FROM KUNI.

She was friendly and very knowledgeable about our ""vehicle of interest"" - an Escalade Platinum ... we were not planning on purchasing a vehicle in a day ... we had set aside three weekends to do our ""due diligence"" and look at as many Escalades as possible - we have owned an Escalade ESV in the past and have loved it.  Since the kids are grown and moved on, we wanted to buy a regular size Escalade.  The Sales Mgr Randy came over and shook our hands and told us that he is going to do everything he can to help us make our purchase and we will not leave Kuni without our vehicle.  We were so impressed with our whole experience at Kuni that we purchased our Escalade Platinum.   From Kaitlyn to Randy and Ron in financing ... they treated us with the utmost of respect and they treated us like family ... heck yes!!! ... within no time ... they EARNED our business.  The Escalade drove ""like a dream"" and we are ecstatic!!!.  I will not hesitate to recommend Kaitlyn Aguleria and the Kuni staff to anyone who enquires about our vehicle.  GO! ""TEAM KUNI"" ...

576,"April 07, 2016","I knew exactly the make, model, trim and mileage I wanted, and had cash in hand to avoid all the issues I've had in the past with dealerships and their... less than savory practices. In short, I generally loathe and detest dealing with auto sales tactics in general, and will go to extraordinary lengths to avoid it. 

I stalked the certified vehicle listings for months to find the one I wanted, and called when a vehicle that matched perfectly came up and told them I was paying cash. I worked with Tarance to finalize the purchase, and as I've seen previously at other dealerships the sales associate had to get their sales manager involved, which I believe was Jason (not certain this name is correct, however). ""Jason"" then told me that the LoJack option that they had added to the vehicle was non-negotiable, which was irksome since it was a $700 addition - not a deal breaker, but enough of a flag for me later to possibly avoid dealership for purchases. Later, several employees told me that it was indeed negotiable, but by that time I just wanted to be done with things and ate the cost.

I know that dealerships are profit-driven and want to maximize these up-sales, but for a customer that spent a total of 4 hours of an employee's time, and for whom the dealership made AT LEAST 2k on the sale, upselling is pretty shady.

Tarance is great though! :) ",4.6

585,"April 01, 2016","I went to the service center to get my tires rotated and parked my car next to the certified arrive center doors walked in and no one seemed eger to help i was shuffled off from one person to the next. Finally someone told me to go to the oil and Lube office so I went there was told I was 14 min late so it could take an hour to do a tire rotation ?? In all actuality it took 2 hours to do the rotation I had a 2:00 appointment. After all of that I was given the papers I needed to sign for the work done. No one explained anything to me so I sat there reading it all. Twards the end there where records about all the work that had been done on my car. Since the cars certified pre owned there was a previous owner and there was a lot of work done on it. The point is I asked the service guy of I could get a copy of the services such as replaced parts that were done on my car under warranty and he just told me that all he needed from me was my signature on the paperwork. I then reiterated that I wanted a copy of the records,he rebuddles saying of course sir then ripped the copies out of the packet of paper he had me sign earlier. And said I'll just have to print up another copy. In all fairness they did full my tank from the last service I had because there was a problem with the communication about what time they closed the service center and since I live in Yuba city it's about an hour drive each way. So they did fill my tank for that altercation. All around the Chevy volt I owns a great car I think one of the best that Chevy makes their service is by far the worst. Some people like Angela Ivey are good with handling service but when it comes to the service center here it's by far the worst.

This time the service manager Vince wen with me on a drive early in the morning during traffic on the bumpiest highway business 80 to feel a vibration.

He couldn't feel it, but at least he tried to get the feel for it. he asked if it went away in neutral or not, but it was so hard to feel during a busy highway time that there were more important things on my mind like the cars around us and keeping us safe. 

After almost a month of waiting we finally hear that they  brought out a GM engineer and had him road force the tires and balance and align them again. After everything they did they say taht it is regular amount of shake for a new vehicle.

REGULAR amount of shake???? I find it hard to believe that this is the final verdict. I guess I will have to be more weary on what vehicle I choose in the future.

I was told that no loaner was available and I'd either need to rent a car or wait. I decided to put the service off until Monday. I left a message for Rick LaTour.
On Monday my service representative Rick LaTour called me back and let me know to come right in and get this checked out. I consider Rick's service excellent. The battery failed the test and Rick advised me that the new battery and service would cost $ 260. and it was not covered because my original warranty was over the 50K miles and the very expensive extended warranty that I purchased with the car would not apply. 
I am very disappointed that a 2013 vehicle with less than 3 years would need a new battery! It's my understanding that most new batteries have at least a 3 year warranty and I can't believe that Cadillac would use a new battery with less coverage than that.

NOW:  
I have nothing but high praise for Kuni Chevrolet and Cadillac - even though it took them a second try to get my CTS Coupe fixed,  they did it with the excellence that I was expecting!!!  The customer service was second to none!!  They did it right this time and followed up with phone calls, research, and detailed explanations.  High praise goes out to Vincent Flores for his diligence in figuring out the problem, ordering the needed parts and everything else that he did to ensure that my experience was a good one.  I will unquestionably be going back there for all my service needs!!
This time around, they made sure they had the part in stock and even though it took a few days to get the part in, they provided me with a loaner car, what great service!!!  I would highly recommend Kuni Chevrolet and Cadillac to anyone that needs service.
Thanks Kuni---

As I drove home, however, the truck was steering to the right.
I tried to call Eric, and it went to voice mail. Another day has passed, and still no return phone call.
All calls are bounced back to receptionist, and they promise connection to someone, but no one ever calls!
Not very happy, as the service completed may have been good, but rotating wheels, and doing the brakes, may have required a realignment, as the car pulls strongly to the right. It did not have that issue when I brought it in.

-I no longer have an ""assigned"" advisor. My previous advisor knew me by name and gave me a personalized level of service. Calling a faceless representative to make an appointment, then seeing whoever is available when I arrive is not the same and diminished the level of service significantly. 

-The woman who scheduled my appointment was not very helpful. She didn't listen to the problems I was describing (asking questions that I'd just answered or were irrelevant based on what I was describing). She was unable to fit me in for a full week (not her fault) but was unapologetic. She then called to confirm my appointment (this was for repair work--why would I skip?), she quoted a different appointment time than I'd scheduled initially.

I had another wait there as well.  After 4+ attempts for further status they let me know that they do not have the parts and to come pick up my vehicle.  ,1.0

711,"January 18, 2016","I stood at the service counter for at least 10 minutes and not once did a service adviser look up and acknowledge that I was even there.  I do not mind having to wait, I do mind being completely ignored.  This has been my experience every time I bring my car in.  I understand that these guys may be busy but a simple greeting doesn't take any time at all.  I was there for an oil change, and had someone taken a second to ask me, I would have been told that I was in the wrong area.  I had never used the express side before and didn't know it was over there. Again, just an acknowledgment of my presence would have done a lot.  If anyone asks for my recommendation for a dealership, I will tell them to avoid yours.  Not because your salesmen are bad, but because they may have to use your service department for their vehicle.  ",2.8

When you buy a car they treat  you like royalty but the minute the papers are signed the tune changes. I've had problems in the past with the service department but went back for a simple recall. Asked if they would check something else, they didn't. They don't seem to be concerned for your time at all and often don't provide any solutions unless you pose them. It doesn't make me want to buy any more cars or trucks from them or even get a simple oil change. Yes, the problems get fixed so if that was the only criteria for recommendation then they would get 5 starts. But it's more than that. ",2.0

After a great experience with the sales team in buying the car, we had to bring the car back a week later to install the (2) items. At the point of sale we were told this would take only an hour, and they also told us that they would give us a loner car if we needed to for the day. So We made an appointment, and confirmed during the week. They assured us it would be a quick visit, and the loner car would be ready. We show up for our appointment, and they tell us it would be a couple of hours. (No biggie, we are getting the loner car.) however they knew nothing about the loner car. After 20 minutes they came back and said they don't have one to give us, but they called enterprise. We were at the dealership for almost 90 minutes before we were in a car. We had trouble at enterprise also. Took us over 2.5 hours to get our ""loner.""
After about 5 hours or so they call us to let us know it's ready. We showed up about 25 min before closing. They did not tighten one of the items that were installed.

I called him at 3:45 - nearly 8 hours after having dropped the vehicle off and they had not so much as even looked at my vehicle. As it turns out it needed to be kept overnight not because of the work needed but because they didn’t start until 4 PM. When asked when I could get the vehicle back the next day the service advisor said 2 PM NO PROBLEM. When we spoke that morning the story was now - by the end of the day WTH? Once again he said he would call and didn’t. Epic fail in the customer service arena. Yes they did discount the bill but it doesn’t make up for the shoddy service. I won’t be back.

806,"October 18, 2015","Although the service department staff was very courteous i feel that my vehicle would have been better serviced had i been taken to the jeep dealer on day one rather then spending two days in a gm dealer attempting to be diagnosed.  on day three is was finally taken to the jeep dealer but brought back to the gm dealer for repairs where the service writer even noted that it was taking them longer as a non mopar dealer to repair. Consequently my vehicle was in the shop for two weeks waiting for parts and repairs because of that issue.
two weeks later i am in need of it going back to the shop as the original issues have returned. 
My other concern is that this vehicle was a Kuni Certified vehicle and the two items found are items that under any certified program would have disqualified the vehicle for certification and where missed during presale inspections. It appears that there is a reason why certification needs to be done by the manufacturing dealer and not the dealer selling the vehicle. I am extremely disappointed by these repairs as the sales staff really pushed the initial high rating the vehicle had received under the Kuni certification.  If these repairs where missed by Kuni and had to be diagnosed by Jeep it makes me wonder what else was missed during initial inspections that i will need to deal with. I also question why the repairs went through my aftermarket warranty when the vehicle had a dealer 1000 mile warranty and the car had not yet been driven 1000 miles. I don't feel it was right to use my warranty for these repairs. ",2.8

Although I have purchased my vehicles with another dealer, I have always brought back the vehicle to Rick and his team to ensure any warrantee work or non warrantee work to be completed.  It says something when there are closer GM service stations much closer to my home but I always come back to Rick for all my service work.  I have 100% trust in Rick in his honesty and his follow thru and communication is what I believe brings me back on a consistent basis.  His level of professionalism is fall overreaching then many service oriented businesses I have frequented.  I appreciate his work and if mistakes are made, Rick will ensure any and all issues are corrected immediately.

I had heard that Kuni sucked, but I was surprised at how horrible they are.

My car was towed there Monday afternoon.  Tuesday they couldn't bring themselves to even look at it.  Wednesday they couldn't bring themselves to even look at it.

Apparently, they were booked solid with appointments through Sept 7, so they could not give me a time of when they would be able to even take a look at the car and try to determine the problem.

Thankfully, Performance Chevy said they would happily accept the car and look at it right away...so, now the car is at a dealership that actually tries to help people.

Kuni should understand that when a person's car breaks down their life is immediately in turmoil.  A service shop needs to make some sort of minimal effort to help or they shouldn't accept delivery of a broken down car.

The guy assigned to my car, Dan, made no effort to move things along and seemed clueless to the concerns of the customer.

For the rest of my life, and as long as the Piece of Garbage Kuni is in business, I will tell people how awful, awful Kuni is...and that we would all be better off it is just went away and died.

852,"September 01, 2015","Eight weeks ago my 5-year old GMC Acadia was towed to Kuni Chevrolet. After fighting with Kuni and the GMC regional rep on our out of pocket cost to replace the engine in this lemon of a car which has had 12 recalls and 17 additional service visits, AND a new A/C and engine mount out of our pocket, we agreed to pay $500 for a new engine and rack & pinion (note this is the 2nd rack & pinion). Kuni took 7 weeks to do the work - 7 weeks! And, the customer service stunk the whole time. They neglected to keep me updated on the status of the repairs and stuck me with the $375 for the rental car I drove until we settled on a repair price. Then, 3 days after picking up the car, it stops running again, and I have it towed to Kuni. Instead of apologizing for the shoddy repairs, the service manager tries to make excuses saying the vehicle is a ""complicated machine."" Really? I call it ""inept mechanics"". Kuni's customer service and quality of work is appalling. ",1.2

Although, I was hoping the repair would have covered (or at least partially) by my extended warranty as it existed when I purchased the vehicle in February 2015...it was not.

I do have one nit-picky complaint.  When I dropped the vehicle car off for service on 8/13/15 is was freshly washed.  When is was returned to me the next day it was dusty and water spotted.  The only other two local dealerships I've dealt with (Mel Rapton Honda and Downtown Ford) typically run vehicles through a car wash or hose them off before returning...just a thought.

After test driving one located at a Chevy dealership in the San Jose area, we were extremely disappointed that they were only offering a very very low trade in for our 2006 Audi.  They were also not willing to work with us on the price of the Volt.  I called Kuni and spoke to Max who was very helpful.  I asked that he provide me an estimated value they could offer us on our trade in.  He quoted me a much higher trade in value and was very accommodating.  We didn't want to drive all the way to Sacramento unless the trip would be worth it.  With a good estimate for a trade in on our Audi, we set off for Kuni first thing the following morning to test drive the Volt we saw online.  We arrived first thing in the morning right when their doors opened but much to our dismay, the Volt we were interested sold the night before. Max assured us that there were many other Volts on the lot that we could choose from and coordinated this effort with Chris.  Chris showed us around the lot and we picked out a Volt that was comparable to the one we saw online.  Chris and Max were very attentive to our needs and concerns, and worked with us throughout the whole process.  Max true to his word, also gave us the same trade in value for our Audi as he quoted me the previous day over the phone.

909,"July 15, 2015","Once again, the service department has me frustrated.  We originally had our car in to have a broken headlight replaced back in June.  The part the dealership ordered and installed was a different unit then what the car originally had.  They failed to let us know the two lights would be different.  We noticed the difference when we got home.  Upon calling the service department, we were told ""yes, I saw they were different"".  Were they just hoping we wouldn't notice and therefore chose not to say anything??  They agreed to order and replace the other headlight to match the newly installed one as they failed to disclose the difference to us at any point when the broken one was ordered and installed.  After a month of waiting, we still had not heard that the part was in.  They were to call us when it arrived to schedule an appointment.  When we called to check on the part, we were told, yes the part had been there.  They just decided they weren't going to call us to schedule the appointment?  Were they thinking we would forget and they wouldn't have do the replacement? 

Another appointment was set for two weeks later to have the new part installed.  I arrived on time and was told to have a seat in the lounge.  I was told to hold on to the keys and someone would come get them.  30 minutes later and I'm still waiting for someone to take the keys so they could begin working on my car.  What is the point of having an appointment if you are going to wait so long for them to even get the keys??  Why wouldn't they take the keys when checking in for the appointment?  

To top off one issue after another, they then left the stock light bulb where the other headlight clearly had a different, and very expensive light bulb in it.  They replaced the stock light bulb with the light bulb that was in the unit being replaced the first time.  Another go around and I finally get the light bulb back that should have been put back in back from the service department.  

Why is everything so difficult with these guys?  Every time we've had to take our car in for service, there is an issue of one kind or another.  It shouldn't this difficult.  The only reason we'll have to come back to the service department is our car is still under warranty.

931,"June 28, 2015","My wife and I went into Kuni to trade in her vehicle. We were helped by Ismael. The deal we made with him was for them to pay off her existing loan and she would purchase a pre-owned car. It was a Sunday so we couldn't call the bank to get the exact payoff so they told us not to worry about it, that they would call during the week and find out. That it would be taken care of. They put down an estimate on the papers. After a few weeks my wife received a notice from her old loan saying she had to make a payment because she was still showing a balance and that they were going to send her to collections. So we come to find the dealer didn't pay the full loan. It seems that the salesperson ismael didn't communicate about finding the exact payoff to his finance guy and instead, the finance person just paid the amount that was on paper. We called back to let them know. I spoke to their finance person toshi (who is very rude and condescending) and said he couldn't do anything for us anymore. I asked him if I could speak to a manager. He said he would have a manager call me that day. The day ended and no one called us back. I had to call back like 10 times to finally speak to a manager because no one ever picks up when transferred. The manager mike basically pulled the 'it's on the papers you signed' card. And said they couldn't do anything about it. I had to tell him to research the situation and at least speak to Ismael about what had happened.  Long story short, they were dishonest and didn't keep their promise. Now my wife has to pay two loans because they didn't do their job. They have lost a loyal customer and our family as well. My family had previously purchased vehicles there but will never go back after this. I hope people don't get in the same situation and stay away from this place.",1.2

957,"June 27, 2014","So I'm in the market for a new luxury sport sedan...
I look at the CTS-V but it's a little too much car for my needs. I was treated with kindness when I visited the dealership and learned about the other CTS models as well as the ATS.  I went home and read everything they gave me and spent a lot of time online researching the industries new offerings.
I did the same thing with Mercedes Benz, Audi and BMW.  Then I drove them all.  Then I read some more.
I repeated this activity until I had narrowed my search down to two vehicles.  The Cadillac ATS and the BMW 328i.
I was impressed with the CTS being the Motor Trend Car of the Year but it was a little more than I wanted to spend so I went back to the dealership to drive the ATS one more time.  Effie was a huge help.  He listened to me and asked all the right questions.  He really wanted to know what it was that I wanted to achieve in buying a car and what my expectations were.  After our discussion and while driving the ATS he said that based on my answers that he felt that I would achieve everything I was trying to with the CTS.
So we drove it.  It was over at that very minute!  The ATS was great but the CTS was everything I was looking for and more.
I told him that I had to have the Luxury Package and a myriad of additional goodies.  We talked about critical options and options that I could live without.  We even went over color options.
The following week I made an appointment to see both cars again with my wife.  Effie was tied up with another customer so Joe jumped right in and took great care of us.  We drove the ATS.  The wife liked it.  Next was the CTS.  Joe went to get the keys and I prepared my wife for what I thought was the perfect car.
Joe came back with the keys and said that Effie had a CTS waiting for us up front.  We started walking and I scanned ahead in the direction of travel and the I saw it.  A SWEET Pearl White CTS!  The same color I'd mentioned a week ago to Effie! It's got the Luxury Package and every option that we talked about!  The pano roof! The black leather! The NAV and Surround Sound! Even the tires & wheels I had selected!!!
Ya see my original problem was the MSRP on the CTS.  It was a little out of my comfort zone.  I thought to myself that there was no way he had this car sitting there just for me.  The exact car I had described!  When I learned that he did I was truly flattered and very impressed!  He really listened to everything I said and had it sitting there for me!
Once I got over it I thought, ""I'm had!  Now what am I going to do?"".  I mean I told him exactly what I wanted but also said it was more than I wanted to spend.  I went around to look at the sticker and it wasn't there.  I didn't say anything but did take her for a test ride.  Man!  What a beautiful car!  A beautiful car that's more than I wanted to spend! 
So while I'm driving I notice that the car has 3000 miles on it.  The wheels in my head start to spin.  Maybe this is possible!
I recall Effie saying the week before that occasionally one will come up with a few demo miles on it and they discount accordingly.
Could it be?  
It was and we bought it!  We love it and the experience was something out of a chick flick (only it was a car deal)!
These guys blew me away and I'm not only very impressed I feel like the luckiest guy around!  It might have been destiny or it could have been by design but the stars all lined up to what I'd have to say was the best new car buying experience I've ever had!
Thank you Effie & Joe!

961,"June 12, 2014","My girlfriend and I went into Kuni looking for a NEW smaller SUV. We dealt with a man named Dave Forget and initially we were really impressed with how ""UN-carsalesman like"" he was...we tested several vehicles and narrowed it down to one that we really liked.  We left and went to other dealerships to test a few more cars and when we were pretty sure we wanted to go with that car we came back to this dealership.  We came back and he was not there so another woman helped us.  We talked inside about final costs and while inside we asked if this car had a rack...we forgot to look and it was evening and dark out, but we travel alot and we hadn't thought about it when we test drove it earlier.  The lady responded ""Yes this model has a rack, it has the crossbars and the actual rack""  I am upset with myself for not checking it out for myself but at the time she seemed sure of herself and I didn't feel I had a reason to question her.  We left and came back on the weekend ready to pay for it in full.  Dave was there so we dealt with him again.  We got there during the day and noticed there was no rack, no cross bars, and the option to upgrade another feature we were told was possible was not an option either.  When we inquired about it, this guy that seemed so kind and genuine, even to our children, became a different person.  He contacted the woman that gave us the information and said it doesn't have it, he's sorry she was mistaken, and basically there was nothing they could do about it.  So we said, how about we look up the cost that it would take to add one and you take that off the bottom line price of the car...We are talking a $22,000 car and a $300 rack.  First they said no...just no....then after talking for a bit they said once we got the $300 rack put on and we sent them the reciept they would reimburse us $150 of the $300....Are you serious??? Not only were they willing to lose a sale over $150, they became EXTREMELY unfriendly, all of a sudden it was like we were bothering them and wasting there time.  At this point...we walked out.  

After speaking in the parking lot with my girlfriend and her father, in order to avoid starting our search all over again and her father not wanting to travel back out to Sacramento, they decided to go back in and buy (this was NOT my position...as I am very big on morals and customer service, and once I've walked out I'm done!)

They went back in...which I refused to do at that point due to the way they spoke to and treated us.  I got on my phone, and vented to my father about what had happened, as they closed the deal inside.  About 5 minutes later Dave comes out and says can you come in, if your not happy we're not happy.  For a split second he seemed to feel bad about the way he treated us.....THEN he says....You are going to get a survey from General Motors and if we get a bad review it is not a good thing for me or for the company!  Wait...so your only being nice now because you got the sale and you want a good review on your survey???? I couldn't believe it.  I shared with him...my father is looking for a truck, and I will be getting a car in a few months, and based on the mere customer service I will not give you my business.  He then says, I just want to ensure that I won't get a bad review...I wasn't even the one that gave you the incorrect information.  I looked at him, smiled and said yes... you'll be fine, just to get him to leave, and to keep from causing a scene.

He walked away and I am still waiting for the survey from GM to let them know about our experience.  

Last week my father bought a  truck from M&S used car, had a good experience, and I am going tomorrow to shop around for a car for myself.  I will never patronize this company nor would I refer them out to anyone.  Who takes the chance on loosing a sale on a $22,000 car that someone is paying cash for over $150????  

They left a very bad taste in my mouth and anytime I speak with anyone about shopping for a car my first words have been and will continue to be DO NOT GO TO KUNI CHEVROLET!  Then I will proceed to tell them how we were treated.  Good new travels fast but bad news travels at lightning speed!

964,"June 07, 2014","I called the Kuni dealership to inquire about the price of an oil change for my car.  The woman who answered the phone said it was $39.95 plus tax for 5 qts of 5-30 oil.  I made an appointment for several days later.  A mechanic friend of mine said I should double check the price because he thought my car took more than 5 qts of oil.  I called Kuni again and another woman quoted me the same $39.95 plus tax for 5qts of oil.  I said I thought my car took more than 5 qts of oil, told her the year and model of the car, asked if she could tell me how much oil it would need and the total price.  She said my car would need 8 qts of oil and each extra qt added $1 or $2 to the base cost of $39.95.  I said I would like the actual cost of my oil change and she said each qt of oil over the 5 qts would be $2 each so I would be charged and extra $6.  When I arrived for my oil change the service guy said it would be $59.95 plus tax for my oil change.  I told him what the women told me over the phone and he said they were very good at their job, but they didn't know the price of oil, that it was actually more than $2 a qt.  He did not apologize about the price difference and proceeded to write up my service order.  I said I didn't think it was right that I was quoted one price on the phone and then a higher price when I came in for the service.  He then said he would lower the estimate to $50 (still more than the phone quote) for the oil change and made me feel like I was being unreasonable to expect the quote I got on the telephone from Kuni employees to be correct.  I accepted his $50 quote and left my car.  

The rest of the experience was fine.  The car was ready when he said it would be, I got a phone call letting me know it was ready and some info about the oil change.  What should have been a simple positive experience was turned into something that felt like a bait and switch experience.  I think Kuni should train their people who answer the phone to either look up the correct information for the customer or transfer the call to someone who does know the answer.",2.5

The quality of the work they do is also excellent. They even throw in a complementary car wash with service visits as an added bonus.

With that said, these days, I will only come here for oil changes and tire rotations. The primary reason is PRICE. Their oil changes and tire rotations are very competitively priced, but anything beyond that is a total rip-off. I've found that I can have additional work (other fluid changes, mechanical repair, brakes, new tires, etc...) done for nearly half the cost at specialty and/or independent shops.

I would prefer to bring my vehicle here for all its service needs, but their pricing has forced me away. It's a shame too because the staff is great and I don't have any complaints about the quality of work.

Being that I was a past customer of Hubacher Cadillac, I made an appointment with Kuni.   Big mistake.  When I arrived I was greeted nicely, then the service writer came with my paper work and told me the cost would be $109.  When asked why he said nothing was included, it was extra for synthetic oil and extra for tire rotation,  when I told him what I had been quoted, he said he did not know why that this is what it would be.  I was very surprised that he did not offer to find out why.  After having a fit, he lowered it to $90.   It really is not about the money, I think it is about being an honest business.  I am glad I went there for service before I had work done. I also got a quote for new tires from them.  If I can not count on what they tell me, I will not be back to there dealership, ever!!!  I guess the sale of 4 tires at $325 each, was still not enough for them to care... Being ups old by a dealership is the worst.",2.0
976,"July 24, 2013","I know most reviews seem to be of unhappy customers, so I thought I'd write about my very positive experience with Kuni Cadillac.  I'm the lucky new owner of a 2009 Cadillac CTS-V, which I just purchased 2 weeks ago down in LA.  Because of the cars age and it had been sitting on the lot for awhile the cars battery was in need of replacing and I also decided to replaced the key fob batteries as well.  That's when things went wrong.  I couldn't get the car started and it wouldn't recognize my key fobs.  I went through the directions in the owners manual for reprogramming them numerous times but nothing worked.  I called Kuni and was able to talk with the shop foreman Vince Flores.  Vince was very professional and I told him what I had done.  He walked me through the steps that I needed to do, which were a little different then what was in the owner's manual.  Still no luck.  I tried everything.  I brought my key fobs into Kuni parts dept to have them checked and everything looked fine.  I tried several more times.  I was concerned as my car was in the garage with the electronic parking brake on.  Since the keys no longer worked I couldn't release the brake or turn the steering wheel, which was going to make getting the car towed to the dealer very difficult.  The next day I spoke with Vince again and he said he would come over after work and see what he could do.  I was amazed as no one had ever offered to do that before.  He did and with the additional instructions he pulled from their repair manual I was able to get my key fobs reprogrammed and my car started.  Vince is a hero and an employee Kuni should be proud to employ.  He is also a very nice guy and he didn't charge me a thing.  Pretty amazing for not having bought my car from them or ever having any work done by them.  He gave up a good 2 hours of his time to come help a complete stranger.  I haven't had a need for any service work yet, but I will definitely be taking it there when I do.  If this is the new face of  Cadillac and GM's customer service I will be a customer for life.  Cheers I hope your experience with Kuni is as positive as mine was.  Thanks again Vince your awesome.",5.0

That's when I met Mike Sheets, he is possibly the best overall auto sales associate I have ever dealt with and this is the 11th car that I have purchased.  He was great from the get go, Mike was actually moving another car on the lot and happened to notice me and still said hi with a smile and said that he will be with me in a minute, I had already known which vehicle I wanted to look at and Mike of course knowing his inventory knew right where it was.  He took the time to drive me to the detail shop down the street to show me the vehicle I wanted to see and throughout the whole process from beginning to end Mike was great, treated me with the best respect and always had my attention with small talk and talking about everything in life.  I have had to go back to the dealership with my new vehicle for some minor things that they had to fix, and even then Mike still greets me with the same friendly ""Hi and how are you doin"" as if I was his first customer that hasn't even bought a car from him yet. Mike has single handedly made me a fan of Kuni Sacramento.  If you want a great friendly experience I would definitely give Kuni a try and hopefully you will be as lucky as I was and get Mike Sheets as an associate to help you out.  Not only will you get great friendly service from Mike you will leave thinking you had just made a new friend.

990,"June 05, 2011","When we arrived at Kuni of Sacramento, we were greeted by a very nice young man, Effie Fuentes.  We already had an idea of which car we were interested in, as my husband had been looking at their website, and Effie took us right over to it.  He also showed us a couple of other cars that he thought we might be interested in.  Once we decided on one car, Effie suggested we take it for a test drive and we did.  We loved the car and Effie was extremely knowledgeable about the car and all of its features.  We ended up buying that particular car and have been very happy with it.

We never felt that we were being pressured to make a decision.  Effie showed the utmost professionalism and, yet, he made us feel very comfortable.  After all, buying a car is not something you do every day!  Actually, everyone that we dealt with at Kuni of Sacramento was very courteous, they took the time to explain things in detail and, most of all, they were very well qualified in the departments in which they worked.

We would highly recommend this auto dealership, as well as Effie, to anyone who may be just starting to look for a car, new or used, or may already have something specific in mind.  If you do decide to go there, you can be assured, you will be treated with the respect you deserve.

995,"March 13, 2011","From the minute my husband and I stepped on the lot at Kuni and meet Fred our car shopping experience totally turned around.  Instead of feeling judged about our budget and what we were looking for in a car like all the other dealerships we had talked to that day.  Fred was very understanding and respectful of the budget we had.  I think in the beginning Fred could tell we were leery about telling him that we were looking for a truck or SUV with a tow package around $5000. Everyone else we talked to about this either laughed or flat out said no and walked away.  By the time we had walked to Kuni's we were feeling a little embarrassed, but Fred definitely changed all that when he started showing us some cars that we could look at in our price range.  Fred got the keys for us and we test drove the vehicle.  We never felt forced or pressured to make a deal.  Fred was very friendly and open to talk to.  When we got back to the lot we felt ready to make a deal and when we went inside Fred asked if we wanted anything to drink and we started talking money.  I never felt pressured to spend more than I wanted to and I actually felt like Fred was on our side trying to get the best deal for us.  In the end we got an SUV with a tow package for the price we wanted.  John was a great help as well with all the paperwork.  I was so excited I accidentally signed on the wrong line but he made no big deal about it and just printed up a new form.  Fred even spared me an extra trip to my house to pick up my check book by following us home with the car and taking it back to Kuni for us.  If that isn't customer service I don't know what is.  We truly appreciate everlasting Fred did for us that day and Thank him from the bottom of our hearts for helping us find the right car at the right price.  THANKS AGAIN FRED!!!!:) ",5.0
996,"March 04, 2011","I bought a ""barely used"" Cadillac Seville STS last week from the same gentleman who sold me the same car, different vintage, nine years ago. What a pleasure. Buying a used car is a tricky thing if you don't really know what you're doing! I made up my mind that if Dave Forget was not at the dealership still, that I would go to my son-in-law's dealership out of the county to get a car for me. Trust is everything to one who is not ""car savvy"". I called Dave, he brought me a car; we decided that the car was not for me......so the next day he brought me THE car. I bought it on the spot.
Then I needed financing......so Dave asked me all the pertinent questions and when I arrived at the dealership I was greeted warmly by John Carpenter. One short hour later I was driving my beautiful new diamond white Seville home.
If I could have orchestrated the the purchase of the automobile, I couldn't have done as good a job, let alone, better!
Thank you Kuni/ Hubacher. You allowed me to buy a car in my county so the sales tax could stay in the city and county in which I live and earn a living. This was very important to me.......
I can't wait to come back in a few years and buy another car from Dave and John. I have told all my friends, especially those who go to hither and yon to save a nickel or two.......what a waste of time for them. I know that they will go to Kuni/Hubacher and to Dave Forget, and if needed, John Carpenter.

1007,"October 27, 2010","To say that the quality of service provided by Kuni Cadillac (previously Hubacher) has ""gone downhill"" since it moved to its new location on Fulton Avenue is a huge understatement.  The sales staff knows very little.  The mechanics are incompetent and not careful with customer cars.  I've repeatedly gotten my car back with the same problem -- or additional ones created by their ""repairs.""  They've clearly been careless with my car -- tearing the leather, leaving greasy fingerprints on the glass/pillars/doors, grinding grease into my carpet, scratching the paint, bending the edge of the frame when lifting the car, leaving the lugnuts loose, and more.  On two separate occasions, they botched repairs so badly they had to send the car to outside company to fix what they'd broken.  I literally don't trust their mechanics to return my car in a safe-to-drive condition.

I badly miss the heritage of Hubacher on Cadillac Drive and I can't believe that several *years* after their move and name change they haven't even broken ground on a permanent replacement dealership.  They don't even have a rental car office on-site, so they have to send customers to the Arden Enterprise location (inefficient and time consuming) for warranty loaners.  The level of service for a Cadillac dealership should be embarrassing and is inexcusable.  GM should ask the out-of-town owner to sell to someone who's motivated to provide a competitive level of service.  With GM's new crop of excellent cars, this *should be* a valid competitor to any of the nearby Niello dealerships.  Because of apathy and mismanagement, it is not.

Sacramento desperately needs a ""Hubacher Cadillac"" or a ""Reliable Cadillac"" -- a dealership that is locally owned by someone who is in the business for the long haul and will only hire reputable, knowledgable people.  What was a promising step up for the dealership has turned into a nightmare for customers who stuck with the dealership.

I've switched back to Reliable Cadillac in Roseville for my service and am very happy with them.  Even though the Kuni location is much more convenient for me, I won't be back unless there is a change in ownership and reputable mechanics are hired.",3.3
