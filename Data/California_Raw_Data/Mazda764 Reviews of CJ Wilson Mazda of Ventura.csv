1,"September 02, 2018","Better than the service center in Westlake. Drove 30 minutes out of my way to not deal with Westlake again. Thinking about the Westlake shop makes me angry. Price at both are a little to high too. But at least Oxnard shop was nice about it. Not cold, mean, and heartless like Westlake. Also Mazda needs to update their ""safety check"" across all on Cali to include headlight check and horn check. Drove off the lot without either working. I was driving an illegal car off of YOUR lot that YOU were suppose to check and make sure was, not only legal, but safe!!!!!! Your guys response? ""Bring it back at your earliest inconvenience and we will charge you more money for your inconvenience, Thank You for choosing Mazda Certified Service...where we do just try enough according to company standards, not state/moral standards"". The negative comments I have are mostly about Westlake, but you guys need to fix your ""standards"" state wide. I would not recommend a New or Used Mazda car to a friend buying a car in Cali right now. Your standards aren't up to snuff state wide. Sorry, but if the truth hurts, but then again, you guys weren't sorry for my inconvenience either.",4.0

7,"August 14, 2018","I came in to CJ Wilson on a Friday morning with multiple problems occuring with my newer vehicle.  It was busy, but they were super efficient with checking me in, and putting me in a loaner vehicle.  I had the loaner g
For about a week which worked out nicely since it was more of an up grade for me.  Once my vehicle was ready, I received a call to come in.  The customer service crew did a fantastic job getting my car back to me better than new.  Great experience over all.",5.0
8,"August 14, 2018",I originally found the Mazda6 we wanted to buy on their website.  The finance manager Ryan Keith was extremely helpful and diligent getting us an excellent deal on the car which we took advantage of.  Mina Vasquez also did a great job helping us through the buying process and following up with us after the sale.  Cannot recommend this dealership enough! ,5.0
9,"August 09, 2018","I purchase a new Mazda Miata MX5 - Hardtop and absolutely love it. Tom helped me and answered all my questions without hesitation.  Kris Wardak made the paperwork so easy. It was a piece of cake. By far the easiest I've ever done!
Thanks Mazda Ventura :)",5.0

For our secondary car, of course, we decided to buy again with CJ Wilson few weeks ago.
We have now 2 Mazda from CJ Wilson Ventura and you’re making happy customers! :)
Thank you to Kris, Bassam and Erik! You’re fantastic! ",4.8
13,"August 09, 2018","My first service visit at CJ Wilson was perfect.  I was immediately greeted at the door by Thomas, who got the ball rolling for me very quickly.  He was extremely personable and seemed genuinely interested in meeting my concerns/needs.  Most importantly, he impressed me with his honesty - which can sometimes be a source of concern at a car dealership.  Thomas checked on us several times while our car was being serviced, and made sure we were updated as to it's progress in service.  It was a great service experience thanks to Thomas and the guys in the Service Department.",5.0
14,"August 08, 2018",I always look forward to my service visits at CJ Wilson.  They treat me like family deserving of very special treatment.  This visit they took extra  care to make sure my car was safe for an upcoming long trip.  Very much appreciated.,4.6
15,"August 06, 2018","Thomas is alway upbeat and extremely helpful when I bring my car in for service. He's a pleasure to deal with every time. You're killing it, Thomas! Keep up the good work.",5.0
16,"August 06, 2018","The team at CJ Wilson was fast and friendly.  My sales rep, Mina knew all about the car I wanted, and we enjoyed my test drive.  We negotiated a fair deal, even on my old trade-in.    Ryan was experienced with all of the required paperwork and got me out in less than an hour.   Really nice experience and now I have a gorgeous new (new to me) car.   ",5.0
17,"August 06, 2018","Thomas was extremely professional, yet personable. I actually enjoyed the experience due to his diligence in making certain that I was accommodated. 
He's a great asset.  ",4.8
18,"August 06, 2018","Thomas the Service Advisor couldn't be more helpful, and he's also such a nice guy! He asked Carlos, the Tech, to look at a rattling issue I was having and within minutes he figured out the issue and fixed it. The oil change and tire rotation was also done within a short amount of time. They also offer a free car wash with the service and free snacks and drinks while you wait. 

The only thing about this Mazda dealership that is irritating is the obnoxious recording/hold music where the announcer sounds like they are shouting as people talk over each other! That really should be changed as no one wants to have anxiety as they are calling to have an issue addressed with their car. ",5.0
19,"August 02, 2018","My first experience on a test drive with John was friendly and adequate but I realized, later, that I was not made aware of many of the features the car offered.  Upon returning, Mina took me on another friendly but much more informative test drive - I was motivated to buy.  Service dropped a little during negotiation and purchasing process - long and wasn't informed as to what was happening.  Bassam never made his way out to me (I was told he was busy with numerous deals at the time), but did greet/appreciate another person next to me.  Kris was a great end to the process - he was efficient, informative and friendly.  Mina followed up with driving to make a personal delivery of some floor mats - appreciated the extra effort.  Overall a good experience.",4.0
20,"August 02, 2018",Stephan and Bassam made the car shopping experience easy and professional.  No gimics. I left feeling like I got a great deal on a great car.  I was introduced to the service team as well.  I left feeling like a valued customer.,5.0
21,"August 02, 2018","Needed a new running light and it turned out that it required an entirely new headlight assembly.  The car was out of warranty by 3 months although it only had 17000 miles.   It turned out that the assembly wasn't covered in my Mazda aftermarket warranty.  The service person was astounded that it wasn't covered as was I.  He talked to them for 50 minutes before he found out that it wasn't covered.  He then submitted an after warranty claim to Mazda and they agreed to cover the very expensive assembly. I commend him for pursuing the issue. Also,  I appreciate Mazda stepping up to the plate on this issue.  It is ridiculous that the motorized assembly is not covered under the after market warranty and recommend that Mazda look very hard at finding other insurance.  
Second, I spent over 50 years in research and development and find it incredible that the entire headlight assembly had to be replaced just to replace the LED running light.  The designers certainly were not looking out for the buyer.",5.0
22,"August 01, 2018","Your sales team helped us get the Mazda CX-5 that we had been looking for.
Eric and Bassam made us feel that WE were in the driver seat and made sure

25,"July 31, 2018","I purchased my car, used with a Mazda warranty, from CJ Wilson. When I brought it in for a problem, Thomas Groebel reviewed the warranty with me and explained which items were covered. He provided a detailed estimate and clearly communicated with me, via text message, the status. No oversell, no hassle. They sent a car to pick me up which really helped too. This experience was much better than a previous one I had where I'd gone through the sales staff.",4.6
26,"July 28, 2018","I received prompt, personable, professional service. My appointment went by quickly. I love the amenities- coffee, snacks, internet access, tv. The staff was friendly and informative.",5.0
27,"July 25, 2018",I had an issue with my head lights and they made sure to check every possible outcome. If it would have been an electric issue it would have costed more money. When I explained the problem in more detail they found out the issue and fixed it right away and made sure I paid the right amount for what was being fixed. Very honest and reliable.,5.0

Kris, in the finance dept. was nice to work with too. He also explained to me clearly how my lease and everything worked.
Everyone was very accommodating and I felt very comfortable doing business there. In no way did I ever feel pressured.
I have visited other dealerships in the past and dealt with aggressive sharks that just wanted to make a sale.",5.0
30,"July 24, 2018","From the beginning to the end, my sales experience was very enjoyable. It is a tough choice choosing the right vehicle for you, but Mina made this buying experience very, very easy. Then she turned me over to Bassam to finish out my purchase with signatures and this was an easy process as well. Keep up the great work because this kind of team is what every dealership should be like. Thanks again to everyone at CJ Wilson Mazda of Ventura!",5.0
31,"July 24, 2018",Everyone was very kind and helpful. I did not feel pressured to get something I did not want or that was too expensive for me. The entire team was wonderful. I highly recommend them ,5.0
32,"July 23, 2018",Mina made it an easy unstressful experience with her good attitude. Made us feel comfortable during our time there. Has great customer service. And to top it off made my children comfortable every second while we where there. Thanks Mina! ,4.8
33,"July 23, 2018","All of the employees at this site are very friendly and helpful. As much as I like to keep taking my car to the dealership that I bought my CX5 from, I don't think that I will be willing to pay $100 for simple services such as an oil change and tire rotation. I feel as though the free car wash was a nice perk but the last two times that I have gotten it washed, it looks just as dirty as it did before they ""washed it"". I literally had to drive down the street to go clean my own windows at a gas station, not to mention there were water spots and giant bird messes still on my car.",3.2

37,"July 17, 2018",I bought my car a year ago from them and still they treat me as a new customer every time I walk in for service.  I've yet to pay for an oil change because they have good incentives. I will definitely  be buying my next cat from them again.,5.0

Heather helped me over the internet while I was looking for a used Mazda 6 and had the car sparkling clean and ready to drive when I arrived for a test drive. She answered all of my questions, took the time to walk me through all of the controls and infotainment screen and gave me an excellent deal on a pristine certified pre-owned car!

60,"June 21, 2018","Initially I walked in interested in an automatic mx-5. Heather helped me but they had no automatics. I came back later that night and dealt with Eric. I explained I was interested in going for one of the manuals on the lot. Eric helped me out and was super personable. It was late and we called it a day. 

I arrived on a Saturday morning and dug my heels in. I let them know the only way I would buy the car is if I fell in love with the numbers. They put up a good fight for awhile. Heather stepped back in the picture and began to pressure me quite a bit. Eventually, I was able to talk directly with the sales manager as I had asked at least two or three hours after I originally asked. They weren’t willing to budge on price or my trade in values. Heather came out and told me both my cars had accidents on their car faxes. I know for a fact she lied to me as one of the cars I traded in I bought a year earlier and had a completely clean car fax. The car that supposedly had an accident on the Carfax is on their lot right now for $12k!  Haha. I had no accidents while owning it. The other car I wasn’t positive, I should have covered my bases. Anyways, the sales manager came out and I finally got things rolling. We eventually were able to work out a deal that I was comfortable with. 

Finance guy was great and explained everything to us. We were able to get an extended warranty thrown in for free, along with lifetime car washes and a guaranteed loaner. These guys will play ball if you push them hard enough. After 8 hours, I walked out with my mx-5 with a smile. Thank you to Heather and Eric. I’ll recommend y’all, I’ll excuse the false report on my Carfax though. ",4.5
61,"June 21, 2018","Thomas was great and clearly communicated throughout the process. I was a little disappointed with the amount of time I had to wait for the part. Any other dealership I’ve dealt with always overnights parts. They did not. The part then came in and was the wrong  color. They reordered the part and had it overnighted. 

They did cover it and didn’t charge me a thing, which I appreciate. The waiting room is a bit small but they offer fast Wifi and snacks. 

Thanks guys! ",4.8

So far, thumbs up for CJ Wilson Mazda.",5.0
65,"June 12, 2018","I drove into the dealership for my first visit at 7:55 am. At 7.56 am I was greeted by Daniel who was very helpful. He took me into the service area and made me coffee!  
I knew it was too early for an oil change but I had some questions and there was what appeared to be a brake fluid leak between my front and rear tires.  The tech servicing my car assured me that all fluid levels were full, the removed panel under the engine showed no leaks at all.  I was on my way with a clean car in less than an hour.
Later in the day, I realized that about 3 weeks before I noticed the leak on the floor I had been driving back from Fresno when the pickup truck in front of me dropped an entire case of brake fluid cans on the freeway. I hit one and obviously it squirted up onto the frame of my car.  It took three weeks for it to get hot enough to drip onto my floor.
Thank you Daniel and your excellent tech.  The tech took plenty of time telling me what he thought the problem was.  I am very happy with my new 2018 Mazda and my service people. Thank you.

70,"June 08, 2018","We arrived at CJ Mazda when the light on the dash of our 2015 6 Grand touring indicatied we needed to check our battery management system. Everyone was friendly as usual and offered to check. After examination we were told that they were unable to see if our iloop was working properly, because their $4000 machine was broken and the dealer did not see the value in buying a new machine since the iloop has been discountined. Also, they were unable to tell us if the battery was the problem, since they didn’t have ONE $450 battery to replace ours  At that time we were told to go to another dealer that had a working machine or another battery. 
Up until this day we were planning on buying our next car at Mazda, but we are reconsidering. Our vehicle has only 50,000 miles on it and had my daughter been driving it cross country (like she has) to school, and this had happened....I would want to know that the dealer would find a battery at another dealer, take a battery out of a car on the lot, take my car on a truck to another dealer that has a working diagnostic machine or give a loaner vehicle. 
Warning; do not purchase the additional bumper to bumper warranty, as thus far nothing has been covered or honored under this agreement including peeling finish on the wheels that we paid extra for.
Now we are left to find a solution on our own. ",2.3

From my initial purchase through my service visits, the Ventura Mazda staff takes good care to meet my needs. Within the past week, I've had three service visits to take care of various odds and ends (oil change, tires, etc). Thomas especially made the experiences wonderful. He somehow manages to treat you like an old friend coming in say howdy, while still maintaining a professional demeanor, and taking care of business quickly and efficiently.

75,"June 05, 2018","My fiancé and I drove every make/model of the small SUV class that exists. We had test driven the Mazda CX-5 over a month ago, and were impressed but wanted to ensure that was the one! When we came back, Bassem helped us, and when we made the decision to get it and told him what we wanted and what kind of financing, he had our numbers within minutes. We arrived at 7pm and I drove off in our new CX-5 at 9:15pm. Filling out the paperwork and getting the keys took less than 30mins, the rest of the time we were there was just our indecisiveness of which color to chose!

I was looking for a new car since I’m going to be moving to Washington soon and did not want to take my current car. I honestly was looking for something super basic towards the end of my search since I was let down so many times. Luckily they had some left over 2017 models and they had amazing rebates! 8k off the price which  absorbed almost all of my negative equity except a few thousand. The best part of all this car was fully loaded to the max and it’s so comfortable. The interior reminds you of a BMW or Mercedes. I’m Inlove with my new car.

128,"February 17, 2018","Before I begin, I bought my Mazda from CJ Wilson and the sales department was great. I have also been taking my leased car there for service for nearly 3 years and have always had a great experience, but today's was awful.
I had an appointement for my 5K mile service at 1pm. I arrived at 12:50. It was a bit busy so I didn't mind that my service person finished up other customers and took calls while I was waiting to get an estimate. The junior service person assessed my car and three tires were in the yellow and one in the red. I asked how much the tires were and they were about $200 each. I told the service person I would want to buy two tires today as long as the mechanics found nothing major wrong with my car. The service person said we would start with the basic service and see - and he would call me to let me know if they found anything. I stated again I would want to put 2 new tires on the car. I went to eat at the cafe next door.

Normally, I get a call in a half hour with the service person telling me if anything was found. I got no call for an hour and 45 minutes. I've never even waited that long for service. I called at 2:45 and the person answering the phone said they were just taking my car to be washed. I said I didn't want it washed and no one had called me about being able to put two new tires on the car He said he'd get my service person to call me back. I waited another ten minutes and he never called so I walked back to the place and the junior service person said they were taking my car to be washed. I said I didn't want it washed after and hour and 45 minutes and I didn't even get the option to put two new tires on. The sales associate finally came in and he said, ""looks like they recommend new tires."" 
This made me furious. I told him I arrived at 12:50 for a 1pm appt and her said they would call me after assessing my car - now my car was all serviced - an hour and 45 mins for just the 5K mile service - and it was 3pm! He said he doesn't know why no one called because he went to lunch. I told him that he was my serviceperson and he should have seen to it that he handed over instructions.
I was so mad I said I just wanted to pay and leave. I went to stand by the very nice and understanding cashier while I waited for my paperwork. As I was walking away, my service person told his colleague, ""It's really not my fault no one called."" That was the last thing I needed to hear!
To add insult to injury, I gave my service person a $10 discount coupon that he didn't even include on the total for my service! I noticed when I got home - on my bill - and when I called, the cashier said I'd have to talk to my service person. I just couldn't do it - so I paid $10 more for my service as well.
I now have to go somewhere else to find tires for my car and wait while they get put on another day. I probably won't get the higher quality tires they have at Mazda - but it is not at all worth it to go back there when I shouldn't have to go back in the first place.
I also have no idea now where to get my car serviced. I either have to drive to Thousand Oaks now - or get my car serviced by a non-Mazda place. 
This has been such a bummer experience - and I don't know what to do when the next 5K miles rolls around.",2.0

135,"January 30, 2018","I have brought my CX5 to this location for service during the last four years.  I feel that this last trip is my last. 

A few years ago, my husband brought my car back and the technicians forgot to put the oil cap back on.  It splattered all over the engine of my new car and naturally smoked a great deal.  What a mess and smell of burnt oil.  It was dealt with, but I was without a car for over a week as I could not drive it and they needed time to pick it up and then fix it.  A replacement car was not provided.  (Seriously?  They are a dealership.  They have all kinds of cars.  I don't need a new one.  One of the used ones would have been fine.  If I had not still had my 1993 Pathfinder, I would have been without a ride completely.)

Three or four visits ago I was told something needed to be replaced for $400+. (Sorry, I can't remember what and am too lazy to look it up.)  I took the CX5 into the shop I have the Pathfinder worked on for a second opinion.  The second opinion told me that there was no need to have the part replaced.  In subsequent visits with CJ Wilson, this part replacement has not resurfaced.  I'm not saying they were trying to rip me off, but the alternative is that they were wrong and it would have cost me over $400 to pay for this mistake.

The second to last visit, whomever cleaned my SUV must have used a dirty rag as it has abrasions in the paint.  They also sprayed something on the black, exterior plastic between and behind the passenger windows but did not wipe it off.  This plastic is now stained with spray-spots.  

This last visit I stopped to look and can see that the employees are moving quickly.  Too quickly.  I opted to not have my car washed - no surprise there.  When I drove off and was on the highway, the tire pressure sensor light came on.  I took an exit and checked all the tires pressures to find all were at 38 pounds.  The technician just forgot to reset it... but what else did they forget to do?  I am aware that forgetting to reset a sensor is not big deal, but it is the last straw. 

Please know that the employees have always been professional and courteous - thus the reason I kept coming back.  I put this blame of errors on the management/ownership.  If you are reading this, management, you need to give people TIME to work and double check the work.",3.0

With the help of AAA, I brought the car back to CJ Wilson Mazda, which reattached the service plate correctly for no charge.
While I have heard of negligence by other auto service centers (forgotten screws, bolts, etc.), I feel that CJ Wilson Mazda service department did not consider their mistake with the seriousness that it merited.

My only suggestion is that cars that are , at least inside the showroom, should be clayed. As of today, for example, there is an black MX5 inside that if you run your hand on it, it feels waxed but it is not smooth.
A waxed smooth paint feel is probably a very convincing tool to show customers that these cars do not feel like regular cars. I bought a 2017 MX5 yesterday. As soon as I got home I clayed it. The white clay was coming out with a rust hue from paint contaminants. After waxing the car, it feels unreal. It took me about 1 1/2 to do. Believe me, it was time well spent. My MX5 was in the detailing department from 3:30 to 5:45.... I could not tell what was done to it....that's...... not so good.

Heather was easy to talk to, no pressure did I feel to walk out with something I wasn't sure about. She'd welcome any questions, and used any downtime to make endearing conversation (also brought us drinks).

233,"June 30, 2017","I was in a pretty tough spot when I went to CJ Wilson. My car of 10 years died suddenly. It was old and worthless. I recently moved to the central cost so my savings were pretty much cleaned out. Not having any money for a down payment, I just showed up thinking I'd be looking around and figuring out how much money I'd need to save. I've had my eye on Mazdas for a while so I stopped by CJ Wilson to see what the new cars were like to drive. I fell in love with a little firey Mazda 3 and started to talk to them about my financial situation. I thought I was just researching but they got me into a lease without having to put anything down. They amortized the down payment, delivery fees, tax, title, and licensing over the whole lease period and even made the first payment(s) for me. I drove off with a brand new car at the exact trim level I wanted and averted a potential crisis thanks to Heather!

Considering my car died suddenly and inconveniently, this turned out to be a happy accident. Love my new car, I'm so impressed with Mazda's build quality, and would sincerely recommend this dealership anyone. Now my fiancé wants to buy a Mazda from them! ",5.0

235,"June 30, 2017","25% sale is done during initial contact and subsequent followup with the customer. The next 25% when he or she walks into the dealership to buy car of their choice. Remaining 50% is not done until deal is closed and signed. We should not sideline role of each and every individual directly or indirectly related to this process. Someone who is showing you the car, taking you to the test drive, getting it ready for you is as important as the person who is responsible in ensuring best in class service is delivered. One may have been reading, watching videos, doing comparisons but something has to be reinforced to make initial contact into sales. We can bring in a customer one time by offering incentives, discounts, rebates etc but building a long term relationship requires more than that which ultimately translates customers into clients or family of clients. If one person has bough a car from a dealership and has confidence in the deal and value they got they will definitely bring more members or convince their friends to see what is so special about it. So those unheard or hidden customers then become your real customers.  For example if someone is brand loyal they may have many members buying same brand, make or model. Customer retention is a big challenge not only for dealerships but so many other organizations. People, processes, and Technology are critical but human is most important among all. 

My experience of Mazda dealership was as pleasant and friendly as I could think of. Bassam and team was very professional, polite, and have done their homework well. I sincerely hope it will go a long way and I will keep my trust and confidence in their offering and top quality service.   
Prior to visiting Mazda dealership, I walked out of 5 dealerships. Typically, they pushed you so much that you end up buying their car and later regret your decision. So no pressure sales ever. At the end I would like to say we should always treat people with respect and dignity and they return your favor. If they do not then they are not going to respect or like or worth time investing in.

239,"June 27, 2017","Kevin seems like a genuinely good guy, sweet man, family man. I've spent over 7 years in sales so I get how a shameless, sleazy office culture can seem normal once you're part of it. I purchased a 2016 new Miata grand touring, electing to finance. I was shopping around on cargurus and auto trader. CJ Wilson's price was discounted but $1,000 above another dealership. Kevin says he has approval to match and beat their price. He texts me I'll be saving $5600. I told him I'm not driving to his location to save only $1 or $10 because the other dealership is 20 miles closer. We talk and text during the day and he says I'm going to be very happy with the price, but he can't guarantee an exact quote over the phone. In good faith, I let him run my credit. My FICO is 792.  
Example 1: At the dealership, time to talk numbers. He quotes me $5 less than the other dealership. This is also less than the $5600 in savings he texted. He says sheepishly, ""but that's why I'm taking you out to lunch after.""
Example 2: re: numbers. I'm wondering why my monthly payments are as much as they are. FICO is 792 and I'm putting down more than $2k which should cover taxes and licensing. He says we're either going to get you on a large downpayment or we're going to 'get you' on a high interest rate.

Wouldn't you be insulted by this xxxxxxxx? Why would I want to have lunch with someone that just screwed me in any way?  

Example 3: human error. The dealership is suppose to give you 2 keys. Somehow one of the keys was for the wrong car. Kevin took a picture of the overnight package, but didn't send it till I, as the consumer, took responsibility for the expense to ship the key back. Does that seem professional to you?

Again, I do think Kevin is a good guy, and he probably doesn't think he did anything wrong. Because 'we all need to get paid' and 'that's just the way things are'. I get it. ",2.4

Jennifer from service department aggressively took over my car once she knew I might trade in my car for a new CX-5 2017. She wouldn't release paperwork to me, she kept saying it is not your car, it is not your car! I was telling her I have not made a deal yet and it is my car give me the copy of the service papers but she refused!  Bennie from sales had invited me for a promotional plan to upgrade with no penalty release of my lease on my Mazda CX-5 2016. He told me I have equity on my car and I need to bring in my car for him to give me a payment on a new car. When I met him that day he introduced me to Heather Massey the sales person and said she'll help you. I asked Heather how much equity they want to pay on my Mazda CX-5 2016, and how much the monthly  payments would be on a new Mazda 2017. Heather kept going back and forth to Mahmud the general manager's office and eventually came back with a piece paper on her hand saying that they would pay $950 on my 2016 as is and they will pay off the remaining lease meaning I do not need to make any payments in June and I will pay the payment at the end of July for the new 2017.  She said my payments will be $410/ month.  I told her that my car is clean, in a very good shape has low milage of 11056 since we leased it in Dec 2015 and I had an allowance of 15000 miles per year. Heather went back to Mahmud's office and came back saying that's what Mahmud is paying for my 2016 car $950 as is, I wouldn't pay anything for that car and they would pay for the remaining balance on the lease.  Regarding the payments I negotiated with Mahmud and he agreed to bring down the payments to $390/ month on the newCX-5, 2017 and he agreed to the rest of the foregoing.  Since it was late, they kept my old car not to put milage on it Mahmud said and I went back home with their loaner car. The next day, Heather called and said my new car is ready , so I drove back to Ventura to CJMazda. It took two hours for Mahmud to prepare the lease agreement. Heather kept saying they are going to give you all the paperwork at the end when I was asking about the trade in of my CX-5, 2016 and the amount of $950 equity documents and how it is going to be applied on the ending of this lease and starting a new one. Heather kept saying they will give you that in the finance department, when from the beginning I was asking for it.  Eventually Mahmoud came and took me to Andtew the finance guy's room and said he will have you sign the lease agreement while he sat next to me and took every piece paper that they asked me to sign with himself to his room and it took more time for him to come back with an envelope handing me saying these are your copies, When signing I asked Mahmud how much did you purchase my old car and he never mentioned anything about negative equity and never pointed out that he had not applied that $950 equity promised to me. He said you don't need to pay June payment on Mazda 2016 any more and we will pay off the remaining lease balance. So the first payment  on the new car was waived. Also, your 35 payments for the new Mazda 2017 will begin in the end of July.
Then they made me to pay $2000 as a down payment on the new Mazda 2017.
Exhusted and drained from this slow paced tedious process eventually I left the dealership with the new car! 
Once I sat in the car, I had a gut feeling that something is off, therefore, I started reviewing the lease but I could not find the $950 equity for my trade in in any part of the lease. Immediately, I contacted Mahmud and asked him where did he apply the $950 that was promised to me for my old car's trade in. Mahmud started yelling at me that you had no equity on your car, you had negative equity and he pointed out for me to look into number 4 the part that had the breakdown. I couldn't believe it that he had duped me in this way, the negative sign was hidden on the line of the paper and he had put $1911.00 that I owed on my old car which then he had added to the price of the new car!  I told him that this is not right and it is not based on what we agreed upon my trade in because if Mahmud had told me he wants to give negative equity on my old Mazda 2016 I would never ever agreed with this deal to trade in my Mazda CX-5 2016. My car had 11056 miles on it and I kept it clean, it was running great and with no accidents. The value of complete similar milage Mazda online is $27,000 and Mahmud has given a trade in purchase value of $22,000 then has made me liable for the $1911.00 and as I said added that amount to the value of the new Mazda 2017. 
Such shyster and violent person that when I went back the same day (June 22,2017)to the dealership (CJ Wilson Mazda Ventura) for him to rectify this fraudulent lease he hid in his office, Heather lied again that he is with the customer. Heather lied saying that they had never offered me $950 equity on my old car. My daughter over the phone had witnessed our conversation with Heather and I had discussed the $950 equity with my daughter in front of Heather while we were sitting at her desk! Heather blatantly lied and denied ever telling me about $950 trade in and later she became vicious towards me and started verbally abusing me yelling that I am disgusting! I called my daughter to join me in the dealership(CJMazda Ventura) because I felt threatened and alone under attack of Heather. Mahmud never came out of Hiding in his office to resolve this matter. I found the used car manager to discuss what had happened to us that day. Heather was standing outside his office looking through the windows telling me I am disgusting, then she began video taping with her phone and giving me looks, shaking her head and harassing my daughter and I. Since the dealership was closed we got up to leave, Mahmud showed up talking to Heather, my daughter felt scared so she asked the used car manager to escort us outside to our car! Meanwhile, Mahmud joined Hearher bullying  us and verbally abusing my daughter. On our way out, Mahmud violently invaded my daughter's space while telling my daughter she is disgusting! Then, while pushing us out vehemently slammed the door at my daughter's face while she was going out! I wanted to call the police and report Mahmud's assault and violent conduct, verbally abusing us, but my daughter said mother lets go home once she saw that I am drained and traumatized from this whole ordeal. 
(I am told by my doctor that I should avoid stress because I am heart attack prone) so that my daughter was afraid for my health condition.  Therefore, we left feeling blathered and abused that night and still after six days past we feel damaged and hurt! I wake up at night with heart pulpitition and my daughter cried for what she witnessed that day her mother and herself being verbally abused and attacked by Heather (sales person) and Mahmud 
(general manager) at CJ Wilson Mazda  Ventura!
We have consulted an attorney and we are told that definitely Mahmud and Heather has used deception in making sales and trade in which is illegal and fraudulent!
I am writing this in the hope that others will read it and no one would fall prey into the lies and deceptions
 of Mahmud and Hearher in CJ Wilson  Mazda Ventura. Mahmud is definitely a shyster and a crook using his position to defraud trusting people Like us.He is violent, obnoxious and unprofessional! He hid in his office and did not come out to talk amicably with us instead he yelled at me, verbally abused us and violently slammed the door at my daughter's face!  Mahmud should not be in the management position that he is right now at CJ Wilson Mazda Ventura because he doesn't know how to be civil and interact with customers. His gang like appearance and behavior frightened my daughter and I , we regret ever going there!  If Heather and Mahmud showed their true face in the first place we would never set foot in CJ Wilson Mazda Ventura let alone buy a car from them!
Therefore, I urge customers not to fall into Mahmud and his accomplice Heather's trap and be fooled by their false friendly smiles because once they set  their claws on you their true face and true color which is so ugly and evil comes out! If they did it to us, I am sure they have done it to others too. Buyers Be Aware!  Don't go CJ Wilson Mazda because they will dupe you and abuse you and take advantage of you in the process of purchasing or trading in your car!  Definitely not worthed to go through what we went through with dishonest low lives such as Mahmud and Heather at CJ Wilson Mazda Ventura!

246,"June 19, 2017","The CJ Wilson team is really outstanding and customer friendly from the Vice President & General Manager to the sales and finance team.  I had an excellent experience in all phases. Started with an email from Eric checking on a response.  Bassam took over and we agreed on pricing terms over email saving me from driving 40 miles to haggle.  When we arrived Esteban and Bassam greeted us and Esteban was a great host and representative for Mazda throughout the test drive process, explaining the features and answering all my questions. Finally got to Ryan in finance and he was very efficient and friendly.

The standout moment that really made a great impression was after the deal was done, I had the keys and the dealership was closed. I was parked next to the dealer waiting for my daughter to return from the local store so we could drive home together.  Esteban called my mobile asking if everything was okay. We were all tired, but he took that extra second to check in after seeing me parked. Above and beyond for sure.

It would need to be replaced with a  new tire at just under $300 for one tire. I opted out until I could check pricing elsewhere. When you are a senior living on a fixed income $300 is a lot of money- imagine my surprise when I took the car to a tire service business to get a quote for a new tire from them and to discover they would  not only just charge  me half what Mazda would but during their investigation- they found no nail in any of the tires. Tires were fine. Needless to say, I am not feeling very good about CJ Wilson Mazda.

My husband is ill and had he been the one to take the call when it came in about the tire, feeling as he did, he would have told Mazda to go ahead and replace the tire. I am just thankful it was I who took the call.

Jennifer Lange was very helpful, Explaining to us how to correctly work several of the many features that the car has, features we had not been able to figure out. So many thanks to her-

After a month I went there to submit the second part of the car payment and it was a very busy month and full of bills to pay, so I asked one of the employees name Kris Wardack if I could submit the last $200 by the end of the month and he helped me with that as well, by taking care of the paper work.

Very clean facility and great educated helpful staff, I have no complains. So far the car is running perfectly and I'm happy with it. It is a CPO Mazda 6 with powertrain guarantee for 25k more miles. The car condition is great, it came well cleaned up and smelling very good like new even though it already had 74k miles, those are advantages of buying a certified pre owned.

I was having a bad day and admittedly called in with an attitude over a small issue that was actually covered under warranty.. something simple with the built in computer that required recalibration.  Not only did the individuals named maintain their cool despite my obstinance, they actually went out of their way to demonstrate compassion and provide a total solution to my issue.  Odalys set me up with a complimentary loaner vehicle, and made the entire process quick and easy.  Bassam patiently provided reassurance that the staff at CJ Wilson is about something more than the bottom line... that they are completely committed to their customers and the vehicles they sell.  This is not typically seen at car dealerships, and I have had bad experiences in the past.  Such is not the case here.  There is truly a demonstration of total care I can see that when you buy with CJ Wilson-not only are you getting a good deal, you are considered part of the Mazda family and it shows.  I can't say enough good about this team, but I can say after owning two other Mazdas, that this is hands down the best place to go if you really care about the car buying experience.  I can't sing enough praise about the team and I will buy my next Mazda here, no question about it.  Save time, save money, and leave happy.  At CJ Wilson, they truly have what you're looking for.",5.0

358,"December 10, 2016","On December 1, 2016, I received a telephone call from Bennie at CJ Wilson Mazda stating that I “could lease a 2017 Mazda 3” for a “monthly payment of $200 - $250 with no down payment” subject to my credit rating.  I asked if Bennie was certain due to the fact that I was paying a greater payment for my 2015 Mazda 3.  Bennie put me on hold “to confirm the numbers” and returned stating that this is what the General Manager Bassam Mahmud “came up with based upon the current incentives (program).”  Furthermore, Bennie stated that the offer “should be in place through to the end of the month.” As a result of this offer, I made an appointment through Benny to meet with John Ahern, the Sales Manager who leased to me the 2015 Mazda 3 in 2014.

On December 3, 2016, I met with John and was informed that based upon the current value of the 2015 Mazda 3, it would be impossible to lease a 2016, much less a 2017 Mazda 3, for less than approximately $346 per month. In other words, Bennie had made an offer, confirmed by the General Manager, which could not be fulfilled. 

I informed John that on or about December 2, 2016, Chase had, or would, debit my checking account in the amount of $327.61 for the December, 2016 lease payment for my 2015 Mazda 3. John assured me that this would be taken care of by the Finance Manager.  As a result, I agreed to trade in my 2015 Mazda 3 and lease a 2016 Mazda 3 for the monthly payment of $346.24 with the understanding that I would be refunded the December, 2016 payment. It was later determined that said lease payment was paid on December 2 , 2016. I also informed John that I had just paid the license fee in the amount of $232 for the 2015 Mazda 3. He told me that there was nothing that could be done about this and he wished that I had come in to see him prior to paying said license fee. 

To recap, the monthly payment for the 2015 Mazda 3 was $327.61. Based upon the new lease agreement, I was to pay approximately $19 more per month for a 2016 rather than, as guaranteed by Bennie via General Manager Bassam Mahmud,  $77 to $127 less per month for a 2017 Mazda 3. 
 
I accepted the higher than guaranteed monthly payment for the 2016 solely because at all times John Ahern was professional, knowledgeable and courteous. He clearly explained that the offer presented by Bennie was “impossible”.  At this point John introduced me to salesperson Mina who took over the lease transaction.  Part of the transaction included the installation of a GPS system. Mina told me that it would take approximately 30 minutes for said installation.  At this time Mina introduced me to Mr. Kris Wardak, Finance Manager. 

I met with Mr. Wardak to sign the lease agreement and supporting documents. I asked about the refund of the December payment to Chase for the 2015 Mazda 3 trade-in. Mr. Wardak stated that he would have to check with Chase and would get back to me regarding said refund. I did not hear from him. 

When driving home I discovered that the GPS system had not been installed as represented by Mina. I telephoned Mina and informed her that the GPS system was not functioning. She stated that she would check and get back to me. When Mina returned my call she stated that she had overlooked providing the service department with the requisite paperwork and that I would have to return on Monday, December 5, 2016 to have the GPS system installed. During our conversation I asked if she could have the finance manager call me regarding the refund. She said that she would. I never heard from him. 

Two (2) days later I returned to CJ Wilson Mazda to have a GPS system installed. While waiting I saw Mr. Wardak and asked him about the refund. He said that he had spoken to Chase and to expect the refund within seven (7) to ten (10) days. 

On or about December 8, 2016, I telephoned Chase and was informed that they had not spoken with Mr. Wardak regarding a refund and that their only communication with CJ Wilson Mazda was for a payoff amount for the 2015 Mazda 3. Additionally I was informed that no refund would be paid to me by Chase since the payoff amount included the December 2, 2016 payment. I telephoned salesperson Mina. She was not in. I left a detailed message for her to call. 

On December 9, 2016, salesperson Mina returned my call.  She stated that she checked with Mr. Wardak and was informed that Mazda, not Chase, would be paying a refund amount to me within seven (7) to ten (10) days after Mazda received the pink slip. I asked her to please send said information to me via email. She said “Yes, definitely” and confirmed my email address. To date I have not received an email from Mina.

I returned to CJ Wilson Mazda and spoke with John Ahern. He confirmed that the refund would be forthcoming from Mazda once the pink slip was received. He was extremely attentive and made certain that all of my questions were answered. ",4.4

The M3 accelerates much more smoothly than the 2013 Toyota Corolla that I traded in and is far more comfortable. 
As for style, the Mazda 3 is on a different planet, especially since there are so many Toyotas on the road. Some would see that as a positive for Toyota; I like having a car that is comfortable and reliable, but which also gives me some individuality.

398,"September 29, 2016","I'm really sorry for the poor review, but I'm very frustrated with how the dealership handled my first new car buying experience. I bought a 2016 Mazda Cx-3 from here. The salesman, Jimmy, was pretty cool - good salesman, but the lot techs there aren't anything to brag about. They ran my car through the car wash and never bothered to wipe down the door jams or clean the windows. I've never even bought a used car that wasn't detailed, so you can imagine my disappointment when I bought a NEW car and it wasn't clean. There was fingerprints all over the windows where the sticker and stock number had been, and the techs just left them there. There was still sticker residue on the window where the price tags were. It was very frustrating. Of all things that really got to me though, it had to be the credit application that they emailed me, instead of having me sign at the dealership, and I feel really dumb for stating that it was ok to email it to me, because now, my social security number is stuck on some servers somewhere. Lastly, I don't know what happened to the credit application that I verified on the computer screen, but the one I signed had my date of birth wrong, my rent payment wrong, and the first round of emails, Estaban never verified my email was correct so now there's an unknown person who could potentially be stealing my identity right now, and yes, I know it's partially my fault, so sorry Estaban, this bus might hurt a bit. Overall, my experience with CJ Wilson Mazda of Ventura was just OK. I love the new car, but I'm frustrated with how you handled the situation. Thanks Jimmy and John you two were great, but I feel like I could've gotten a better financing rate, better deal on a 2016 model, and I probably won't be making any more 3 hour trips to your dealership to feel like I got ripped off, again - Based on KBB's fair price of the car, I paid $1,000 too much.

400,"September 26, 2016","My wife went to you dealer with check engine light.  I was told over the phone that the code was P0128 ""coolant temperature below thermostatic temperature regulating temp"" and that both a coolant control sensor and the thermostat had to be replaced.

There was no attempt to diagnose the problem as one time event due to a long down hill coast that brought the coolant temp too low for a short time.  That could have been done by re-setting the code and driving a short distance.  The service people refused to re-set the code.  

I beleive the service department took advantage of my wife, since she was on a trip and did not have any other options.  The description of the problem was over-exagerated and I believe we were ripped off with an unnecessary repair.  This code appeared a few years ago and was re-set at the Santa Barbarsa Mazda dealer and never re-appeared until this time.

After much research, we decided we were interested in purchasing a Mazda CX5 through the Costco car purchasing program. The first person to contact us was Tom from CJ's. An appointment was set up for the following day. We thought Tom was great! Tom was courteous, professional, and was not overbearing. We went for a test-drive. We liked the car. Everything was cool, but now the work was to begin! We were shown the Costco price we would be paying. We were shown the invoice to verify the numbers. We asked for $11,900 for the trade-in of our 2013 Mazda3 with 18,700 miles, which was based on the KBB quote. We were offered $11,000.  At first, I balked at the low trade-in offer, but we were made to feel the Costco deal gave us no room for negotiation. We received the customer loyalty discount of $500, and at our request, the Labor Day discount of $250. They didn't even know what we were talking about. I found this discount on the Mazda website. We also wanted the 0%  loan rate that they were offering customers who qualified (that was us!). When we went to sign the loan papers, the loan rate was listed at over 4.5%. The deal was going to be off if that rate was not changed. Needless to say, the finance guy went down to 0.9%. We took it. What I'd like to know is, if Mazda was offering low financing, why did we have to ask for the lower rate? Between the low trade-in and the questionable financing, we left with a feeling of distrust. Our dealings with Tom were A+. Our dealings with the financial part of purchasing the car is why we give it a three-star rating.

To begin, we were met with a smile and a hand shake, followed by the John and I talking about what I was looking into getting. After the long list of awesome features in comparison to my wife's 2011 Mazda 3 grand touring that were available on the new model as well, we jumped to the cx 5 which I figured would fit her better. The whole time the dealership was busy and he did not miss a beat! Then worked with the general manger Mr. Bassam to ensure that we not only had the best price for our trade but also the best price on the cx-5 my wife had decided on.

410,"September 10, 2016","To all Prespective Mazda buyers:

From the moment my husband and I drove into the parking lot (by the way we drove down from Santa Barbara because we heard good reports on this Mazda dealership) and entered the showroom, we were greeted and treated professionally. My father sold cars for 50 years both full-time and part-time, and I sold new cars myself for a year, nearly 8 years ago. So, having been around dealerships all my life, I was still nervous, as I wanted to make sure I was buying the right car for the right price. We did our homework and had been looking for the past 3 months for a smaller SUV with great features: safety, moon roof, sound system, back-up camera, leather seats, good looking wheels, etc.

I was pleasantly surprised to realize the lady holding the door for us as we entered asked ""if she could help us"", and of course delighted to work with another female salesperson. Heather Massey was knowledgable, listened as both my husband and I were asking numerous questions (at the same time, I may add) and I loved she owned the Mazda we were considering. 

Maybe the most amazing part is Heather met our price. We would be leasing and needed a low monthly payment to make it work.  We were willing to walk away if we could not come close, but she met our price and I drove home in a beautiful Soul Red CX-5 Grand Touring Mazda. 

During the process we also met the General Manager Bassam, who was equally accomodating as well as Kris in Finance.

Make sure you go to CJ Wilson Mazda of Ventura before you purchase!

Sincerely,
Renée 
(A happy CJ Mazda customer)

When I arrived for the warranty service I wasn't fully aware of the amount of work involved and so did not prepare a ride home. Not to worry, though, as CJ Wilson Mazda provided a loaner car of comparable size and even trim level!

Jennifer kept me updated at every turn and really went above and beyond to make my service experience the best!

420,"August 26, 2016","I stated ""Tust your Local dealers for several reason, for one Ventura is a small city, and good independent auto shops are few and far between, and when you find a good one their price's are higher than your Dealers price's (not like before when the Dealers price were rediculously higher). Another is the Dealers give your car a through inspection, no matter what you brought it in for (at least they do at C J Wilson Mazda), if this is done at an Independent Shop they charge you for inspections. Finally I will tell why I trust these Dealers, I own a Mazda RX8, and there was one Independent that would even work on that model, anyway I toke my car to I won't mention their name (Dependable on Wells Rd.) because I detected a smell like my clutch was burning, and for them to check it out. I was told the smell was from oil leaking on my exhaust pipe, which they repaired, but two weeks later my clutch went out so back to the shop it went. So here's the Kicker, I had a recall on my air bag so I had to take it to C.J. Wilson for replacement, they gave my car a full inspection, and found out that my transmision had one bolt missing, and three bolts loose. To add more insult to injury I inquired about how much th charged for clutch replacement, I was quoted a price that was $500 to $600 less.

Victor in the Service Dept could not find the Warranty, and when we arrived no one had information about the repair that I had discussed.  Victor could not explain how the dealer would use the Warranty, but emphasized that we would be billed for repairs.  Finally Jennifer intervened, found the Warranty online, and set up the service.
We left the car over the weekend to wait for parts.  On Monday, I never got a call letting me know when the car would be ready.  When I called in the afternoon, Victor told me he was ""waiting to get paid"" from the Warranty, and I had difficulty finding out when my car would be finished.
Customer service was poor, as we were not greeted when we arrived (2 representatives ignored us at the service desk, then one told us they were ""multi-tasking"" and would get to us later).  When we picked the car up, Victor gave the completed paperwork to the cashier without reviewing or discussing the service.  We were left to find the car out in the parking lot ourselves.
In the end, we paid for diagnostics which we believe were covered by the dealer Warranty.  The recall was completed to our satisfaction, but we declined to have the dealer do repairs because of poor customer service and communication.

436,"August 08, 2016",Service was great! Victor was great! very quick and efficient. However I did feel like my price for service was just too much. I am a prior Toyota owner and my oil change service did not pass 69 dollars and that included everything I got with you guys. I also was not presented with a price list so I didn't know how much I was paying for each item or if it was just all one price. I guess it serves as a learning experience for my self as well to just ask what the break down is vs letting you guys tell me. Not sure if I'd go back I may have to do some research and see if you have any specials prior to going. I did sign up for the app but again that isn't something I was told I can do until I saw the poster in the lobby. ,4.2

I told them to jump it and let it run for a few minutes to see if it held a charge, which it did.  That should have been the first course of action and I felt it was a bit shady to try to get me to buy something that probably wasn't needed.

I explained that all my oil changes werdone at CJ since I purchased veh., from them, He told me that CJ wilson techs had the wrong tool and they didnt have the part today to fix it. The next day when I returned in a loaner car from CJ, I paid my portion of the broken part and for the oil change, almost 100$. the same day as I was about to leave for San Fran from Moorpark I looked under the hood and found that I had no wiper fluid, low fluid in raditor and no fluid in rad overflow, and power steering fluid was 1/2 full . I stopped at parts store and did the maintenace my self, PS the battery posts were crusy so the tech said he would clean them up no charge since I had to wait so long, they were also not cleaned.

It's not a question of what happens if they lose the one key but when they lose it.  I wanted a second key ASAP.  I called around the other dealers in my area said it would be a few days before they could work me in.  Although CJ Wilson was equally busy, they managed to work me into their schedule right away.  One hour later I was out the door with my second key in hand.  Thanks.. ",5.0

The sales man did say that the AC works so I turned it on to my surprise it was very warm I said. Sales man says oh it being an older SUV takes a while yeah right, only got cold slightly but when at a stop warm air being in Bakersfield with 110 temp in summer you need AC. Now that I have this SUV I can not work because the AC never worked correctly to begin with. Monday I talked to a manager who told me that I needed to spend money out of my own pocket to see if I could find out what the issue is really?? So now on Tuesday I talk with someone in customer relations gave them the whole run down on what happen, Now mind you signing the papers for the sale was all bad for a used SUV that I paid cash for need to run my credit wow since when. So after this long mishap my mind was not on the fact that the AC did not work as it should because at this point I am frustrated as all get out just wanted to get in the new SUV and go. No one wants to own up to the fact that the AC never worked right from the beginning. This was an upgrade from a 1999 Tahoe where everything worked in it not to mention because of no AC I now my not have a JOB Transporting people to and from this was the main reason for buying this SUV. To work PT while being a full time student and my roommate moving out on short notice so I had to do and find something quick  to keep my Apt. But guess who messed that up out on the street my have to leave school do to no internet yes my classes are online only thanks

We went to another dealership which was closer because they told us they had the car, when they never had they car and hadn't even located one from another dealership, needless to say that was a horrible experience.  While we were there, I called CJ Mazda because online it said they had the car.  I spoke with David who was very honest, helpful and courteous, he checked in their computer and even went to the lot to make sure it was there.  He even went so far as to send me pictures of the car.  Everyone in the dealership was very polite and helpful.  The employees and the atmosphere made us feel very comfortable.  Before we left they filled up the car with gas and David even set up our bluetooth for us as well as going over instructions on how to use the electronics and navigation.

507,"May 19, 2016","I absolutely give this dealership two thumbs up. First, let me say my sales representative, Tom Hayden, has the patience of a saint. I began my search for a new car not exactly knowing what I wanted. I borrowed a Consumer Reports, Auto edition, and read about several different brands. Frankly, I had not given Mazda a thought until the reviews I read as well as the video reviews I watched. Without exception, Mazdas got excellent reviews. So, I gathered a couple of friends for support and headed out with a list of cars I wanted to try and a list of features I wanted. I visited 5 different dealerships and drove 11 different cars (SUVs, sedans and crossovers). Of all the dealerships and all the sales people, Tom was the most professional and the least pushy. At each dealership, I made it clear on the first day I was just ""doing research"". Other sales people simply didn't get the message and kept urging me to buy from them that very day. Mazda was the only dealership I visited more than once, and each time, Tom greeted me with a smile and answered all my questions. When I finally decided that Mazda was the car for me, I returned yet again, asking to drive the Mazda CX-5 and the Mazda 6. Both were superb vehicles but for me, it had to be the Mazda 6. Tom introduced me to the manager, John Ahern, who made sure the car I wanted would be ready for me the next morning, and to Ryan Keith, who handled the loan paperwork and explained different options offered. When I picked up my new car the next day, Tom couldn't be there but Heather Massey turned over the keys and took a little ride with me to see if I had any questions. She could not have been nicer. Tom called later that day just to make sure that all went well and that I was as delighted as he knew I would be. I absolutely love my new Mazda 6 and recommend this dealership wholeheartedly to anyone looking for an excellent buying experience.",5.0

Although my service person was friendly he was overworked (only one handling customers) and the general service area is lacking and not very clean. My repairs were done as expected but it appeared that the customer was not an overall priority plus the employees are multi-tasking and too many customers and not enough service personnel helping the customers. Service person had a very dirty hat on. I thought he was a technician working at the service area. Over-all service experience was not on par with other local dealers at this time.,3.2

AJ received our car buying certificate and honored the program which made our visit haggle free and enjoyable.  I have never met a salesman with such in depth experience and knowledge about the cars on his lot, AJ went through all of the bells and whistles in a concise but informative manner.

532,"April 21, 2016","I came in to Mazda after deciding that it was time to trade in my Mazda 3 and upgrade to something a bit bigger and more comfortable for myself and those I drive with, being that I drive a lot for work and am constantly commuting.  From the moment I stepped on the lot I noticed the difference, the car selection was great, called in to Ryan who was awesome. He took the time to listen to my needs and check mark the best type of car for me. We initially decided to test drive the Mazda6 Sport, and I fell in love with the comfort and the look and feel of the car, this car doesn't feel like your average Mazda, it's truly impressive. After parking the test car, I saw the color and trim of my dreams on the lot and asked to just sit in the car, noticing the Mazda 6 touring in blue crystal blue, just felt right. After some deliberation and absolutely no pressure, I decided to have my former car appraised and to my surprise, this dealership really took it's time to give me a fair offer and deal on this new car, and I had a really bad initial car buying deal at another dealership back in 2012, and this dealership took the time to make this next deal even better, and for me (working in sales) I noticed the level of service and authenticity was top notch.  Came in with only the intention of gathering information, and walked out financing a new 2016 mazda6 with absolutely no regrets. This dealership really takes all the extra care steps necessary to ensure that I had a positive experience and I truly respect and appreciate that. I will going forward look forward to dealing with CJ Wilson Mazda in the future and reccomending it to anyone I know looking for a good quality dealership.

I worked with Tom; he was no pressure, knowledgeable, and friendly. Kris, who was in finance, went over the paper work with me. He tried to tack on some weird security feature price and when I said I didn't want it he said that amount would just go back onto the sticker price. Again I said no, that wasn't part of the deal, he then agreed and we moved on.
 
I am enjoying my car, it is just what I wanted. However, I thought it could have been detailed a little better on the inside and there was only a quarter tank of gas when I drove off the lot. After I purchased the car, but before I drove it off the lot I noticed some chipped paint around the gas tank and asked if I could get some touch up paint and I would do it myself. I was told they didn't have any and that I could get it somewhere else (can't remember the suggested place). I thought that was strange that they could not accommodate that request. I have had my car for almost one month now. Just yesterday I noticed there was a problem with the passenger side window, the window will not roll down. I have an appointment after the weekend with the mazda dealer near me, I hope this is covered in my warranty.

We have tried to schedule our appointment when a loner car was available but they will not let you do that. We have been the first one in line when they open to ensure we get the loner car but there never seems to be one. I believe they don't have any it's just a lie to get you to buy the package. Also if you are looking forward to the free car washes, don't. My teenage son could do a better job and every time they put another little scratch in it.

Jennifer was very helpful and kind! She definitely has spectacular customer service skills and definitely made my first experience a lot better. However there were issues that were concerning me that did not get taken care of, I specified that I was hearing noises in the rear of the car when running over bumps, kinda like a clunking noise, researching it, it appears the sway bar end links get loose?

I really wanted a full diagnostic to ensure everything was in good running condition with the car but there were still issues that were not resolved and I really have no idea whom to take my car to now to have all my concerns taken care of.

Negotiations were typical - always seems to be a catch on that side. Very disappointed once we got to finance to find out our education rebates come back at $250 but advertised at $500. CJ Wilson website showed 12k miles per year which was part of the reason we came there. They wouldn't honor that - said the Mazda Inc website was only 10k.

Esteban did not go for the hard sell, and took his time listening to my concerns.

 The price is fair,  and I know I don't have to worry about them doing it right or ""sabotaging"" my car. 
After a truck tire and rim hit me on the 101 I needed some tweaking to fix what the body shop recommended. They provided me with a loaner car and got the job done right as fast as parts availability would allow,(2 days)  Another plus is that they don't have an employee turn around issue for me there like other places  that I have dealt with,  so they accutally know who I am. Jennifer and Clint in the service dept. as well as the parts staff are easy to deal with. Even the mechanics are friendly.

654,"November 14, 2015","At every stage of the experience, from sales to finance to service, the employees were all very open and informative about the car I was purchasing and what they were doing at every step in the process. Most importantly, they applied no pressure in the selling of the car or presenting me with finance options. Unlike another dealership which has been flooding me with call since I expressed interest in a purchase, the CJ Wilson team gave me all the information to make my decision and for the week between when I first visited and test drove to my final purchase I only received a single friendly email. When discussing financing they asked me for information about my driving habits and then recommended a finance plan that would best suit that but they in no way pushed me into using it. Between the car I purchased, and the accompanying packages, the financing plan, and the payment all of their recommendations felt genuine and not like ""recommendations."" I detest high-pressure and aggressive tactics as I feel they are used to mask inadequacies in product and service and so I can say confidently that CJ Wilson Mazda gave me my ideal car-buying experience.",5.0

I didn't have that attitude with Wilson since I felt from the beginning they were making a really good deal and everyone was so nice.  In fact, I did something I have never done in my life.  The day after I got my CX-5, I went back to the dealer since I left something in my trade in.  I offered to buy Starbucks for everyone working that day.  Only four accepted, but making the offer made me feel good.

My car has less the 19k miles on it and it's been serviced regularly, though not at this dealership.  The people with whom I dealt were extremely nice and quite friendly and the dealership and service area spotlessly clean.  However, they ""recommended"" that I have ~$600.00 worth of work done, besides the maintenance service (@$49.00) that I requested.  It included a complete drain, flush and refill of my power steering fluid, brake fluid and antifreeze.  These being priced at around $150.00 each.  I asked the reason for this and was told that ""they hadn't serviced my car before and didn't know what it might need"" - when pressed for more I was told that the ""power steering fluid looked a little thin and smelled just a little burned.""  I didn't think these were sufficient reasons to spend that much money.  I asked that they give reasons for the extra fluid work so I could talk about it with someone who understands cars better than I, and all I got was a sheet of paper with check marks indicating that service was ""requiring immediate attention.""  My brakes had been serviced and replaced just a year and a half ago (not at this dealer) and I can't imagine that the brake fluid is in need of flushing after so short a time.

737,"July 24, 2015","I give the highest rating because my experience buying my 2016 Mazda CX-5 was great.  I worked with Tom and he showed me all of the vehicle features and let me test drive it.  After going to drive a similar style car at another dealership I realized that I liked the Mazda better.  They tried to pressure me before we left.  It made me feel uncomfortable.   Luckily we returned  to CJ Wilson and the purchasing process was not stressful. We did not have to haggle for a great price.  They are professional and proud of the cars they sell.  If you want an honest, knowledgeable, and friendly car buying experience go see Tom at CJ Wilson Mazda.  We even had 2 little kids in tow and the financing department was completely understanding and efficient.  Ryan got us through the paperwork without dragging it out.  We are now happy to be part of the Mazda family.  Zoom Zoom!  Thanks Tom for making my car buying process a positive experience! ",5.0
738,"July 14, 2015","I've bought many cars in my lifetime, but this was my first purchase without seeing or driving the vehicle first. I found a 2014 Nissan Titan SL on Carguru.com in Ventura, CA. It had all the options I was looking for, but more importantly it was priced well below book value. I looked within my area but could not come close to the price CJ Wilson Mazda offered. I looked into transporting the vehicle via 18 wheeler to Mobile, AL. Even with the shipping, the deal was far superior to any local offerings. 

I would have been much more nervous except for my salesman,  Tom Straszewski. He was ""No Pressure"" during negotiations.  He also kept in touch with me throughout the whole buying & shipping process. He was there to see that the truck was loaded carefully on the day of pick-up. He sent all the paperwork overnight. When the truck was delivered, there were no hidden surprises. The truck is beautiful and runs and drives like new. I am a very satisfied customer and would recommend CJ Wilson Mazda of Ventura, specifically Tom Straszewski, to anyone. ",5.0

740,"June 22, 2015","I went online and saw a vehicle that I was interested it.  I sent an email regarding this car.  I received an email from Esteban stating that the vehicle was still available.  Esteban stated I should fill out the credit application online and that he felt confident that they would be able to help me get into this car.  Well I did fill out the application and emailed him back letting him know.  He emailed me back and stated that his manager was currently working on finding an approval for me. At this point I am still waiting to hear back from either him or his manager regarding if I was approved or not.  I am very disappointed in the lack of communication that I have received since I put in the application.  I had found their website based on all the reviews that I had read and thought that this was a different dealership.  A dealership that understands that people fall on hard times and sometimes need someone to give a helping hand, when the recipient is willing to do whatever it is that they need to do. Now when I go on their website the car that I was looking at is no longer listed on the site, and I still have not been informed that it is no longer available if that is the case.",1.0
741,"June 17, 2015","I am a new, first-time owner of a Mazda3 and I could not be more pleased--with the car AND the purchase experience. It all began with Tom Straszewski, a top-drawer sales person and outstanding representative for CJ Wilson Mazda. He's infinitely informed, professional to the max, and unstoppably patient. He's also fun and interesting to talk with. After two weeks of doing diligent research on a new car, all roads were leading to the Mazda. AutoBlog and Consumer Reports had me seriously persuaded to get the S Touring Hatchback, but my interactions with Tom delivered the final  convincing that my decision was the right one. 

Shout-out, too, to Kris Hadak in F&I, who made the financing experience as painless as possible, with zero pressure tactics.  Also to AJ who sinqued up my new iPhone that I bought the day after the car. 

I like the way that CJ Wilson works--it's a relaxed atmosphere, everyone works as a team, and company pride is on show everywhere.

742,"April 21, 2015","My husband and I went car shopping due to me being in an accident a week prior and my car being totaled. I was deciding between a Chevy and Mazda. Tom worked with us initially and was very helpful and answered our many, many questions. Since we were unable to actually stay and purchase a car that day, we returned the next day and went for another test drive. I ended up loving the Mazda CX-5 and bought the floor model that day! Tom was excellent to work with and everyone involved in the deal helped make the 'car-buying' experience great! We will definitely recommend this dealership and Tom to our friends and family!

744,"February 14, 2015","I purchased a certified used 2011 Mazda 3 iTouring about a month ago.  On my home after purchasing the car, I noticed the middle of the dashboard was warped.  I wasn't sure what to do because while I loved the car I was upset and felt I had bought a defective car.  I took the car back to the dealership the following day and they immediately address my concerns.  Within a week, I was informed they would replace my entire dashboard at no charge! I couldn't believe it.  Not too often will you find a dealership who would do this for a customer.  Tom, Daniel, and Ryan all provided excellent customer service and solved the issue quickly and effectively. The repair work was didn't take long considering the amount of labor involved and they even gave me a courtesy car!  Also, the dashboard looks perfect and is exactly what I wanted. In the end, this experience provided me with a glimpse of the great customer service you will get when you do business with CJ Wilson Mazda.  Thank you.  ",5.0

748,"November 27, 2014","I had started communicating with them by email about a week ahead of my first visit. There are some email miscommunications around, but I had pretty solid pricing on one of the cars that I was looking. 

Bassam, the general manager of the location responds my email most of the times, and his emails are all straight to the point. As a customer, I don't really appreciate ""layers of politeness"" in emails, and Bassam's responses are all simple, no-nonsense, no over politeness, and fast. 

On the day of my visit, Max Jacobs was my sales representative. He was kind and professional. I think he did his best for me. Like Bassam, Max was friendly, honest and very hard working when I requested some favors with the deal.

Over all, this dealer is great. I can recommend to anyone who are tired of dealers with jokers, polite-robots, and liars.

751,"October 31, 2014","I have never liked pushy salesmen jumping on me and handing me business cards everytime I step on a lot. What a difference at CJ Wilson. My wife and I made 4 different trips there while searching for a new car. The first person to help us didn't even have a card, he was just helping out from his usual job! On my second visit I met Tom Straszewski, a true gentleman. Tom let me test drive and kick tires and never skipped a beat when I told him I wasn't ready to buy for a few weeks or a month. 

On my wife's visit he had her test drive, showed her colors and options and never pushed a sale once.

Of course, when it came time to buy, we called Tom. Bassam the sales manager met a price I had from another dealer and threw in some extras to make us happy. We were in and out and driving our new car in a couple hours. Good work, guys!",5.0

We weren't actually planning on purchasing a car that day, but they made us felt so comfortable and gave us such a great deal without pressuring us, that we couldn't pass up the opportunity.  I would also like to add that their dealership is very clean too.  I've been do several dealerships that weren't that well maintained, which ruined my first impression.

757,"August 16, 2014","If I could give ZERO STARS I would. I have never written a Dealer Rater eview before but specifically signed up to tell you how horrible this dealership is. Avoid this dealership like the plague. The entire team is dysfunctional from top to bottom and are completely dishonest. Please take a moment to read through this review and ask yourself if these are the type of people you would trust and would want to be spending tens of thousands of dollars with.

Some Highlights:

-Made me drive 700 miles round trip to buy a car that was supposed to be ready to purchase but was in the service bay with no brakes on, front wheels removed, and no service technicians available to put the car back together when I arrived. I had called multiple times to make sure that the car was ready because of my long trip and they confirmed every time to come down. When I asked why I wasn’t told before I came down that the car wasn’t ready, I was told by Tony (Salesman) “that he doesn’t take calls for anyone on his day off” and that I should just “call my boss and tell him I can’t come into work the next day because I needed to wait for this car.”

-Mario (Used Car Sales Manager)  promised to refund me the gas money from the wasted trip, either off the purchase price of the car OR in cash if I did not buy the car. Tony (Salesman) and my friend Erik were there when this agreement was made as well. I did not buy the car and they refused to honor refunding me the money I spent on gas. 

-Went a second time to buy the car and the clutch failed 300 feet after driving it off the lot. Dealership agreed to make the repairs and call me when it was done. Tony called me the following week to tell me repairs were done and come get the car, then 2 hours later Basaam, the General Manager, called me back and said the clutch was actually not engaging properly in 3rd gear. I asked when that repair would be done, and was told they wouldn’t be repairing the car anymore. I was given an ultimatum to buy the car as is or get my deposit back. 

-When I brought up not receiving my gas money that was promised to be refunded to me by Mario (Used Car Sales Manager), the Basaam (General Manager) told me I was lying even though he was not at the dealership that day. He spoke over me and got extremely defensive when I said I don’t like the way he does business, told me “we don’t need to have this conversation” and ultimately hung up on me during the call.

-As of today, 8/16/14 the car has been re-listed for $1,000 MORE than what I was going to buy the car for and its original purchase price. They realized that they didn’t inspect this car carefully enough before accepting it as a trade-in, undertook a large amount of repair costs, and instead of chalking it up as a loss and repairing the car properly, they are now trying to sell it for $1000 MORE than what it was originally listed at. They say there is a 12 month/12,000 mile warranty on the clutch and VVT which is true. What they are not telling you is that the transmission is bad and the clutch will fail prematurely. This will easily be $2,000-$3,000 in repairs down the line. 

-For reference the car in question is a 2006 Mazdaspeed6 Grand Touring. The VIN number is JM1GG12LX61102075. Unless you’re comfortable doing a transmission rebuild/replacement or are willing to spend $2,000+ to have a shop do it, stay away from this car. When I asked for a full inspection report, which should be done by Mazda for every car being sold, they were unable to produce a copy and could only give me a shop invoice for parts from the VVT repair. Who knows what else is wrong with this car!

Again, do these sound like the type of people you would do business with? Do you really want to risk tens of thousands of dollars on dishonest people? THE ANSWER IS NO. Do not waste your time and hard earned money on this joke of a dealership. ",1.0

The sales consultant Mike Schnabel is very thoughtful and considerate. He will not push you or get in your face. He is also very trustworthy and is very knowledgeable. Most of all, Mike finds out from you what you can afford and genuinely fights to have you leave with a car at a rate you can afford. Mike brings a personal touch from his years of working as a consultant. Some businesses think that sales consultants are just about getting the sale. Not CJ Wilson Mazda which is more about the person. I hope this business continues to appreciate people like Mike. ",5.0
