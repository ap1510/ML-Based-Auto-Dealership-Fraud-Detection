1,11-Apr-20,"There service magr Keith is a liar. Was charged for a toll to return a loaner car for a warranty transmission problem. Was told I would be credited back to my CC. Never happened. 
Would NEVER buy or visit them again. ",1
42,13-Jan-20,"I just got off the phone with them and they have offered me an appointment 3 months from now, which i would like to say is a rare occurrence, but this happened to me the fist time I tried to have my vehicle serviced as well.(no exaggeration they said 3 months last time as well)The manager told me they are taking care of all of the police vehicles and can not squeeze me in. Maybe its me, but customers service should extend to your loyal customers as well as, or even more than, a contract you got from the city",1
45,12-Jan-20,They’re your best friend when trying to buy a car and once they got you they can give two xxxxs about you.  The service is so bad I have to go to Jersey to have my cars serviced.   I absolutely hate car dealerships...and this dealer just reinforces why I feel the way I do.,1
73,02-Dec-19,"I should have known better from my first terrible experience with Dana Lincoln since when I originally was looking for my car, the service was so horrific I had decided to proceed with Lincoln of Queens instead (which was a pleasure). Back then I was not living in Staten Island but now that I do reside on the island I decided to contact Dana Lincoln to service my lease.  My car will be going back in a few months, but since the engine light has turned on I wanted to check it since I drive with my infant son everyday. When I called Dana Lincoln Service the woman who answered did not even listen to my issue for service but rather saw I had months left and instead of scheduling an appointment put me on hold and all of a sudden I am on the phone with a sales rep. She did not tell me she was forwarding me to sales nor did I ask. What I asked for was an appointment for Service.  When the sales rep sent me back to the original woman I spoke with she dismissively said that since I wasn't looking to return the car and lease a new one at the moment, that and I quote ""due to the holiday season they are backed up and will not be able to get me an appointment to check the engine till FEBRUARY 24th""!!!!!!!!! Of course my response was absolute shock and to which she sighed and asked what color the engine light was and responded that ""it should be fine to drive with the engine light on but if it turns red that I must stop driving it and have it towed."" 
I explained to her that this was unacceptable and dangerous .  My husband then spoke to this woman and she left us on hold for over 10 minutes to speak to ""Keith"".  She finally came back and said Keith was unavailable to speak to us as he was with a customer and would contact us back in 10 minutes.  It has been two days since. 

In the interim, I decided to contact Queens Lincoln Service Department.  The woman we spoke to was such a pleasure, who not only offered me an appointment the first of the week that followed, they are DRIVING HERE TO THE END OF STATEN ISLAND TO PICK UP MY CAR, LEAVE ME A LOANER, SERVICE MY VEHICLE AND THEN DRIVE IT BACK TO ME. 

The crazy thing is, is that I WILL be getting another Lincoln and I was waiting till next month to purchase but based on the service with Dana, I rather drive all the way to Queens then simply drive the 10 minutes to Dana.  Everyone should always receive top notch service, but being a Vice President of Sales for over 10 years, I know from my experience that there is even more of attention that should be given for a prospective customer.  Make the experience a memorable one to ensure the loyalty of the customer and remind them of the quality of Lincoln. The reason people purchase luxury vehicles is not only to have the beautiful car but also to have ease of purchase and ease of service.  I would never recommend my family, friends, or clients to Dana Lincoln and to the viewers of this review.",1

124,28-Oct-19,"Whenever my car needs service, I lose it for minimum a week at a time, regardless of what the issue is. I brought my car in back in June to have it looked at since the clips on the bottom of the seat no longer stay attached. We went back and forth on how the warrantee would cover the fix, whether repaired or replaced until finally they stopped calling to update the status. I called at the beginning of September and made my own appointment for October 1st and then spoke to my adviser to make sure it would be taken care of.  He told me it should be really fast and I would have it back 2 days later. October 28th and I still do not have my car back. I had been calling every day for status updates, sometimes receiving them and sometimes no one would call back with the update. I've even tried leaving messages for the service manager, who also does not call me back. On week 3, I was told that the place they brought my car didnt fix it so they brought it somewhere else. Week 4 I was told the 2nd place told them it could not be repaired it needed to be replaced. 28 days and my car is still not done. Being that I've been trying to get my car there to be repaired since June and now it is October 28th, this is beyond ridiculous. ",1
272,17-Mar-19,"I was deceived, documents are all with other numbers, tomorrow I am going to sue, justice should be, I never would have thought that people could be like that, people review their contracts and check everything, because they say that the insurance is free, and take money for her",1

886,21-Aug-18,"I have a Ford Transit. With a guarantee I received a letter that I need to come to the nearest dealer and fix the malfunction. I came to Dana Ford, the mechanics were ready to accept me, but the man who was sitting in the office, impudently sent us .... I called the Ford headquarters, left a complaint and opened the case for this dealership.
I know what the host will say now, that we should have queued up and waited. I fully agree with this. But no one told us this, but just very rudely sent from here ....",1
926,18-Jul-18,So my car is in the sevice department for a steering issue for 3 weeks. As of today the service manager Anthony Fallacaro tells me that they took an educated guess and changed the rack inpinion for the second time. Same garbage service since 1989. Very unprofessional staff throughout. Would never recommend the dealer or ford ever again,1
927,17-Jul-18,"I’m not sure how to rate the service as of yet! I know I had an appointment for 7:30 am. I brought the car down mind you at 710am. Checked car in for passenger seat lumbar. The running board motor that was suppose to be ordered under warrant... drivers side window will not go down it was repaired supposedly and 1 month later broke again after it was fixed under warranty! Let’s see if it’s covered even though the warranty ran out! Anyway, reason why I wrote this I go back for  my keys I needed that I had left on my ring car was parked in same spot still not looked at! And it’s 2:00pm. I informed the person that I’m leaving for NC this Thursday to visit my son who is a Marine and I would need it back!

933,05-Jul-18,"I took my 2014 Mustang GT with a supercharger to be serviced.  Check engine light was coming on.  The mechanics didn't have a clue, told me nothing is wrong.  Took the car to another dealer and they told me my exhaust pipe was loose.  Are you kidding me?",1
937,23-Jun-18," I was swindled into.a car lease that I can’t afford.

My ten year old car was experiencing transmission problems and before I was stranded with no car I decided to trade it in for a 2015 Subaru Forester for $17000. After the car was delivered to me and my old car was driven away I noticed that the rear hatchback for the trunk was a manual open. This posed a serious problem for me and a deal breaker since I’m disabled and lifting it is very difficult for me.

After some serious thought after six weeks with the Forester I decided to trade it in for something more practical for my needs and also receive some of my money back in a trade. I was also uncomfortable spending so much money on a vehicle. So I started researching cars under $10000. 
I came across a 2007 Nissan Altima at Dana Ford here on Staten Island which was on Wednesday May 30 2018.

I went to the dealership on Wednesday May 30 to test drive the Altima which I wasn’t so thrilled with. Before I knew it I was in the showroom and they’re showing me a brand new Ford Fusion, and I kept telling them I can’t afford $27000 if I’m not comfortable with spending $17000 on the Subaru.
After much cajoling by the salespeople before I knew it i left with a brand new car that I couldn’t afford. They kept insisting everything would be ok.
Oh, it will be fine!” she said. “We’ll work with you”said another salesperson. “It will be great!” Naile said.
Well it’s NOT great for anyone other than the person who received the commission. 
This is going to put me in financial ruin!!!!!!

The next day I called them to speak with the manager because I can’t afford this vehicle. He wasn’t in and I was told by the salesperson, Naile Telic that he would call me Friday when he was in. Well of course no one called and I called in the afternoon to find out what was going on. This conversation with another manager named Juan led to a shouting match. I called again later in the day and reached Juan again who also insisted everything will be find after telling him again and again that I can’t afford it.

Now its Saturday June 2 so I decided to go straight to the dealership to straighten this out. I met with yet another unnamed manager who threatened to call the police on me after telling him that I can not afford this car. Another manager came and took me to the dealerships supervisor in which after about a half hour he told me there’s nothing that can be done and I’m stuck with the car. He gave me another 15.000 miles a year and I still don’t have that in writing!! 
He also suggested that I can afford $200 a month to pay off the lease. The fact is, I receive $1200 a month in disability benefits. Living on that is difficult enough. How thoughtless and cruel it is to even THINK of that for anyone!!!

They used my Forester as a three year “downpayment” and after three years will be financing the remainder of approximately $13000.

The issue is in three years I will be 63 and not finically able to pay off a loan and in no position to do so now either. As i stated previously i am disabled and receive a fixed income of $1200 a month and will not be able to afford to make payments of any kind. So after three years I will not only not have a vehicle but out of all the money I needed returned to me from the Forester to buy something much more affordable.

Oh, it will be fine!” she said. “We’ll work with you”said another salesperson. “It will be great!” Naile said.
Well it’s NOT great for anyone other than the person who received the commission. 
This is going to put me in financial ruin!!
Not once were my needs considered.. that the fact that I’m disabled and receiving disability of $1200 a month! That at the age of 63 I’ll have car payments? I honestly don’t know what I’m going to do!

They REFUSED to take the car back even though I called the next day to do so!! Who does this to a disabled senior citizen!!

Naile Telic you repeatedly asked me for a review, here it is! And thank you for acknowledging ANY of the emails I sent you in which you completely ignored.

Dana Ford and it’s employees have left me NO choice but to submit a complaint with the Better Business Bureau and as of Monday June 25 2018 I will be contacting the Staten Island Advance. If I get no satisfaction from that I will contact the New York Times and every local television news to resolve this.

I can NOT afford this. I want to return the car ASAP. I NEED MY MONEY BACK!!!!!",1
939,16-Jun-18,"I started a lease approximately in December of 2017. Not even over 2,000 miles on the car, since day 1, the car has been in service more than I’ve driven it. Starting with paint blemishes, and electrical issues, not to mention the occasional downpour that I get inside my car, like I’m on a water ride. Back and forth and back and forth, the dealer refuses to fix the issues. Instead I’m told that the issues can not be duplicated and therefore cannot be fixed. The owner is nowhere to be found to back up his faulty product. The service manager is unprofessional and rude. I demand that my vehicle be bought back and for me to be treated like a human being as any other Paul g customer. I pick the top of the line Lincoln so I could enjoy myself and this has been the WORST experience and extremely depressing. The only positive thing that I will say is that my service writer Deb, who’s no longer there, and Chuck, still works there, are amazing people and extremely helpful. Let me add - I finally got my car out of service today. After the dealer tells me that they can’t find anything wrong with the vehicle, I go to put my 2 year old in the car with a moldy smell!  Buyers beware! ",1
971,16-Apr-18,"Had appt on monday car wasnt looked at for 2 weeks. Bought vehicle brand new with 4k demo miles did not realize those miles will be used against me and charge me instead of covering explorer under warranty. Courtesy vehicle was given to me then im told im being charged 30 dollars a day for courtesy vehicle. This stealership is terrible never again will we buy another FORD 10 more months and we will be returning ford explorer. Service manager agrees with us about the demo miles and still does nothing about it. Complained to FORD CORPORATE and they refused to help as well... BEWARE OF DANA FORD NEVER BUY HERE . THE EXCUSE THEY SAY IS THEY NUMBER 1 IN THE NORTHEAST LMFAO , THEY SUCK PERIOD.",1
1012,14-Feb-18,"I tried to return a lease to Dana ford, and they told me they wont take it because the car wasnt for them. Instead of the manager being all nice about it, he was yelling and screaming. Saying I am not making money therefore I wont take this Fu&% car back. I went off on them on their facebook page. They responded that if it was over 70 miles from the original dealer they would take the car. The dealer i got the car is exactly 84.1 miles away fron Dana Ford. If the manager had good customer service skills, he would have taken the vin # down and excused himself while he looked it up on the computer. Instead when my white ford fusion pulled into the service garage he came out like a crazy man. Asking what do we want. My mom and brother was nice and said we need to return the lease it over. That is when he started screaming and yelling. He told my lease guy who came with me becuase ford had a policy where the owner needs to be there. The manager came running out the showroom and told the guy I told them I am not taking the car. To get off his lot. Lucky I make my mom record stuff like this when I am not in her presents. If you wanted to be treated with respect and dignity DO NOT GO TO DANA FORD. Bring your business someplace else. Where they will respect you if you did or didnt get a car from them. ",1
1044,29-Dec-17,"Where do I begin?  I walked in on Christmas Eve to look into getting a vehicle.  I was helped out by a very polite sales rep by the name of Francesco.  This is the only bright spot of this disaster.  Once we test drove the vehicle we wanted, we agreed upon a deal and I signed a lease.  Prior to signing the lease I advised the finance group that my credit was not in the best of shape and ask if this deal was guaranteed regardless of credit.  I was advised by both sales rep and and Finance that this deal was guaranteed and I could come Tuesday to get the vehicle.   So foolish me believing these con artists, leave  the down payment agreed upon to set up lease of the vehicle. 

So I call Tuesday to confirm that I will be there to pick up the vehicle, and I speak to the finance manager ( Jeff) who now states the deal is not valid and they can not do anything without a co-signer.  When I advised that both the sales rep and Financial Manager said that this would not be an issue.  I was told that this never occurred.  So I asked for the refund of my payment and was told by Jeff that this would be ready in the morning for me to pick up.   

So now Wednesday I call and speak to another gem (Steve) who now tells me that refunds are not given until Friday.  When I advised that Jeff stated this would be ready today, I was called a liar.  When I advised that this experience has been dreadful and I would  file complaints, Steve stated that it isn't their fault my credit sucks.   Really classy management here.    

So now today (Friday) around 2PM, I walk in to get my refund check,  and of course it still isn't ready yet.  So basically Dana Ford is holding my cash down payment hostage.  When I asked to speak to the owner, I was advised that I was not allowed to.   Not even 5 minutes later, I have my attorney call Dana Ford and all of a sudden, there's nobody there that my attorney could speak to.   Then my wife calls and speaks to the manager in finance and they tell her that "" had she not called, they were going to make us wait until Tuesday"",  and then has the nerve to call my wife and tell her that unless we take this review down,  we will be waiting another 2-3 weeks to get this check.  Are you kidding me??  Update 3:24PM EST.  Juan has now called my wife advising that now we are not getting our money back and that we can sue him for the check.  


This is the kind of horrific experience that you only read about in magazines or hear about in the news.  Dana Ford is an absolute disgrace and could care less about the hard working people unless they are making money.   I have complained to the BBB and the Consumer Protection Agency.  I will also be using my social media and print media contacts to bring to light what an absolute disgrace this dealership is.  ",1
1152,20-Oct-17,"2 plus days and my car has not been looked at by mechanic. Was told sometimes it takes 2 weeks!!! Spoke to so called Service director and he said we are very busy and number one in the nation and if I don't want to wait take car
Back. I owed 10 plus Ford vehicles never bought any from them and when I told him that he said that ok we don't need your sale.  Nice   I live 3 miles from them and I don't know anyone who has had a pleasurable experience. ",1
1157,02-Oct-17,"My first review was unethically removed, but as my car goes back today (to a different dealership thank God), It's only fitting to walk you through my entire 2 and half year lease from Dana Ford. I'm going to list all my experience in bullet points, as it would come out to a short novel otherwise...

Day 1 after buying the car, I call to see when registration is being sent: I was told both salesmen quit.

Soon after, a tire needed replacing. Upon buying the car, I was told my tires and wheels were fully covered for ANY Ford dealership. Guess what? They snuck in a 3rd party warranty, forcing me to come back to their dealership for any repairs. 

Later that year, I needed a wheel replaced. I was told it would take 1 day. 3 days later, they still didn't have it fixed, and I was being LIED to by 2 different employers at the dealership. Each telling me my wheel was undergoing something different. NOTE: I was a college student, and this was my ONLY car. 

Throughout the next year, employees I was trying so desperately to work with continued to be FIRED, leaving me with NO connection to anyone in the dealership, time after time and again. 

I noticed a strange popping sound coming from the steering column of my car, so I took it in to Dana (Unfortunately). This is where they took the car, and kept it for OVER A WEEK. They REMOVED the steering column, but could not figure out what was going on... so they put everything back in, and handed me an even more broken car.
PLEASE UNDERSATND WHERE I'M COMING FROM. The first day they took the car in, they told me it will be fixed THAT DAY. I waited in the dealership for EIGHT hours. I missed a full day of work, and class, and had to have someone pick me up, even though they really couldn't. This is where I met other disgruntled customers, and heard their stories. 

My first review on this website ended here, before it was removed unethically.

I was approached by the dealership, and they asked me to come in and see if there was anything they could do to help (they wanted me to take down my review). They put me in my car with the ""mastertechnician"" (lol)... We drove around Staten Island, while he showed me pictures of his motorcycle, and girls he likes (while he was driving).

I was asked that same day, oh so kindly, to remove my review. I DECLINED AND IT WAS REMOVED ANYWAY. 

All of this is only the main points that make Dana Ford a MUST AVOID. I don't care how many positive reviews they're getting. Stay away.

Did you know Dana Ford uses their ""New Giant Dealership"" as a selling point, when someone was actually killed during construction?

Going into this dealership in my early twenties literally changed the person I am today. I simply did not think xxxx of this nature existed in the front lines of local business. I HOPED that it was reserved for top tier politicians, and sociopaths, but I was very wrong.

1177,14-Aug-17,I had an appointment on 8/11/17 here to see a Ford Explorer. When I agreed on the trim level I wanted the sales guy spoke with a manager and came back with a price of 825.00 a month. I have A+++ credit and currently lease a Denali for 598.00 a month. They were not willing to work on price. I went to the Ford dealership in Brooklyn and got the same Explorer for almost 400.00 cheaper a month.,1

1197,29-Jun-17,"Received a quote in writing and put a deposit of $500/-. with a 6 to 8 weeks waiting period for a Ford Fusion Energi.  On completion of 6 weeks, called the dealership several times without any answer. Finally when I visited the dealership was told it would to take another 6-to 8 weeks.  However when asked for a refund, the General Manager found a vehicle matching my specs and trim with a promise it would be there within two days. Went to take delivery  of the vehicle and everything was as smooth as can be. Started signing the paperwork and suddenly noticed that the price for the 
buyout was not the same as the written quote.  The finance guy told me the price was from Ford Motor Company which was lie since I had already spoken to Ford Motor Co.   If a written quote which I have in my position cannot be honored, how do we trust a dealership to do the right thing after accepting delivery of the vehicle.

I was told that I needed to pay more money because the bank wouldn't accept what joe p. Guaranteed me last night. The finance person- maybe John- was rude and disrespectful- I left and demanded that the gm call me and apologize. Shocking, he didn't, and he furthermore explained that the business he oversees is acceptable, and sees nothing wrong with the conduct. So, it's ok for employees to guarantee something they have no control over. He then tried to assure me that my 1500 deposit was not being held hostage- well thank you. When I called back to get my refund for the deposit I left last night- I was asked again what price I would agree to pay- Thanks but no- I was then told that I have to wait until Friday to get my deposit back- because the owner only signs for refunds on Fridays- and it would another week before the money was credited to my account.

We looked at an older year of the raptor and we didn't love it but we liked it. So they encouraged us to put down $500 deposit and assured us that it is refundable. When we were no longer interested in the truck they refuse to give us our money back. This is bad business and terrible customer service I would not recommend this dealership to anyone. ,1

I'm paying car insurance for two months on a car I don't have and you want to charge me $30 for gas on something you never fixed.  Really?

If you have the unfortunate opportunity to meet this clown, you will see how he lacks the ability to communicate as a manager. A manager is expected to work with his sales team and the client without telling you outright lies. This does not speak for the entire staff at Dana - Lincoln.

They said not a problem, no appointment was necessary.   I took off from work today purposely to bring the car back.  We showed up today to bring the car (which was inspected and under-miles) back.  The manager told us he can't take our car because he had no room for it.  When we questioned if we had leased the car from them 3 years ago, would they take it back?  He answered YES.   If we were going to lease another car from them today they also would have taken it back.  We also asked that if we moved from TX and wanted to return this car - Glenn answered - YES he would have taken that car back, but since we leased from NJ - he said he had no room.   This all transpired very nasty too.  He was totally unprofessional and nasty.   We called and lodged a complaint with Ford Credit.   Ford Credit said it's the dealers responsibility to take back the car and that Dana Ford was breaching their agreement as a franchise.  I informed Glenn I would post this and his answer to me was ""Go ahead"".   Very unprofessional dealership who just lost a future customer.   ",1

1559,01-Oct-15,"BEWARE Worst experience I've ever had buying a car. 

I was lied to about the date the car I wanted was supposed to be arriving on, bear in mind I had put a deposit down on this car so I was serious about purchasing it. For over a month I was given the run around about when it was supposed to arrive, but I finally decided to just take one of their stock vehicles sitting on the lot because they already had my money from the deposit for the car I actually wanted and there was no clear date when it was actually going to arrive at the dealership It was ""in transit"" for over a month according to them.

I must have been over to that awful place 5 times in total, each time I went it cost me $17 in tolls, plus gas, and the time out of my day. They never reimbursed me for my tolls and the staff are shady as anything - they're more interested in being on their phones than helping you and they're clueless about anything you ask them. I was told originally my payments would be so much a month, but then when I actually came in to sign the papers the price had magically gone up $90 a month for the same car. 

Honestly save your money and go to any other dealership, this place caused me so much stress and I feel like I was robbed. I would never recommended this place to ANYONE.",1

It broke down in the middle of Manhattan the very next day, we had to get towing to take it back to dealership, however towing company was trying to make me pay for towing even though i had extended warranty!!! The car was towed by certified towing company not to the dealership as it was supposed to be but to a parking lot overnight!!!!!(4pm it was picked up). Not only the back of the car was scratched by them but nobody wanted to pay for  fixing it!!!! It only got worse from there. We owned the car for 3 months it was in the service for 29 days!!!!!!!! Finally when we took it to the service the last time we got rental and DANA was supposed to pay for it but they never called that our ford is ready and they cursed me when I asked if the roof they were supposed to paint was done!!!!???? Jeff( service guy) claimed they need separate authorization and I need to return the rental and wait a WEEK to get authorization for roof paint!!!!!!( roof paint was a screwed up job by DANA Before we got the car,After first car wash paint came off). I told them my car is staying in the service until everything is done and they will be paying for my rental until i get my car back. It appeared I was left with $750 bill by rental place!!!!!!!!!!!Why  did i have extended warranty for? when finally I visited DANA with my lawyer they decided to trade in my car for a brand new ford transit! GREAT except  my $10,000IS GONE right there. The car traded in was actually returned with no money back and I had to pay extra $10,000 as they told me it will go for paying off the bank percentage! BS!!!!!! It was supposed to be $3500 not $10,000!!!!!!!!! Also all i got returned was money from extended warranty!!!!! Seriously PLEASE BE CAREFUL WITH THOSE PEOPLE! JOHN DALEY AND JEFF ESPECIALLY!

1775,11-May-15,"Went for a TSB ( Technical service bulletin) to Dana Lincoln. Job was done very bad. Unprofessional. TSB took them 3 days for 3.1 hrs job time. Technicians damaged my car interior... did not finished TSB. Not recommend to use that dealer service. Very unprofessional. Service adviser and Technician did not listen customer, and does not follow correct procedure when fixing cars.
Update:  on a second pickup time, after inspecting my vehicle, I have noticed very bad and visible scratches on my dash panel, passenger door interior, B-Pillar and seats plastic, driver seat plastic  was broken, and, of cause, improper fitment of my front seats leather sleeves, ( however , improper fitment was the reason, that I have not accepted job for the first time). So when I told  and showed these problems to my service  adviser, I was told that I HAVE to accept a job and complain to a Lincoln.  Seeing that dealership does not care about clients, I have removed vehicle from dealership and went to my house, once I got on highway, I have noticed that my steering wheel is OFF center, and not centering correctly after turns. So I think they messed up my steering angle sensor , or maybe badly hit a pothole ( speedbump). I have returned immediately to dealership and showed these problems to Service Manager - Martin. Guess what answer I got? - Complain to Lincoln... After I have open a case with Lincoln, and wrote review on Dealer Rater, I have been contacted by Service Manager - Martin ( The person who said: Complain to Lincoln, remember?) who demanded that once I will remove my review, only THAN he can (  He CAN, but does not WANT)  seat and discuss with me my car problems. However he did not sounded that he care about anything,  He sounded like he is giving me a Huge favor. Also he told me that he does not care about my single negative review... ",1

Then when I spoke to a manger at service area he told me there was nothing he could do for me and that ""THERE IS NO WAY DANA IS GOING TO GO IN THERE POCKETS TO FIT BILL FOR A RENTAL"" .

2240,19-Jan-14,"Worst Experience Ever! Do not buy your vehicle here. 

When I came into the showroom I was treated well and shown many different model cars. The salesman and manager, Glen, both showed interest in helping me purchase a vehicle. Once I signed the deal and got the vehicle, it was down hill from there. Dana Ford staff refused to honor the many promises that were made to me by the sales staff. They claimed that the salesman had no authorization to to offer the stuff that they did. Even small things, such as getting plates, they refused to do. The staff turned into hostile enemies and refused to return my calls just to get things that were promised to me.

I will never EVER purchase a vehicle here again. STAY AWAY!",1
2242,18-Jan-14,"Service department is incompetent and is not fair with customers. While I was waiting for them to service my car, I heard one of the customer service reps quote a price of 210 dollars to an elderly gentleman to install hood struts on his car. That is like 40 dollars worth of parts and 10 minutes of work. They even told him that they were out of ink to print out an inspection sticker. Never mind that NY has not had that inspection system for like 3 years now. 
I can't even scrape the surface of the lies they tried to feed to me. Let's just say I was schooled already in the warranty process Ford has and caught them in a bunch of lies. If you don't feel like working on my car because I did not purchase the car at your dealership then just say that up front. Don't look like a fool when I call you out on the BS you are trying to feed me. Nice try though. 
Their best customers are the uneducated who they can take full advantage of. Shame on you guys. ",1
2254,08-Dec-13,This dealership is a joke and should be ashamed of themselves.  I spoke with Tony Donato on the phone and made him an offer on a pre owned vehicle. He spoke with the used car manager and an agreement was made that if I came down today they would make the deal for me if I came down today.  After driving over an hour and a half Tony had one of his sales puppets tell me that the vehicle was sold and someone called him with a deposit.  I asked to speak with Tony directly and he told me the car was sold and the people were traveling over 3 hours and were on their way. Tony agreed to sell me the car and went back on his word. He is very shifty eyed and cannot be trusted.  I would have left a deposit if he wanted but we left it by his word that he will hold it for me to come down.  To add to the lies and deceit of this dealership I received an email and follow up phone call a few days after this. They told me the car was still available and if I'd like to take it for a test drive.  The way this dealership conducts it's business is part in parcel to the slime ball tactics of car sales spear headed by Tony Donato. In retrospect they probable didn't want to make the deal at the agreed price.  I wish them luck!!! Signed a lost customer for life...,1

2328,26-Apr-13,"Dana Ford prides itself on being NY City's number 1 dealer, clearly an ambiguous term. They are the ONLY game in town (Staten Island), hence their sales, & leases reflect this. They certainly work the ""hard sale"" on you & Tony Donato tried to browbeat me into buying a new car when my intent and budget was for a vehicle one year old. Wait, it gets WORSE... The service department has my car A MONTH now, and has given me EVERY EXCUSE imaginable why the warrantee covered repairs have NOT been completed! Lie after lie about parts being on backorder when FordParts.com ASSURED me, they were available! In defense of Matt Lopez, I feel for this young man... he is OBVIOUSLY being DIRECTED by  management to STALL and DELAY this repair work. He has probably been threatened with the loss of his job unless he ""plays ball""... there is NO WAY he would be this ignorant without being under duress. My only explanation for all this is, I did NOT purchase the vehicle from Dana Ford. I'm sure Jim Cognetta the owner wishes to take care of HIS customers first... this is understandable. I can understand being pushed to the bottom of the pile, but A MONTH???? C'mon REALLY! Ford Motors even REIMBURSES Dana Ford for the work, but apparently this doesn't matter to them. Ford Customer Service is the ONLY one who got the ball rolling on this. Case in point... Dana told me the part I needed was, ""Not in stock at ANY of Ford's warehouses in the entire COUNTRY"" and gave me a printout showing NO INVENTORY. Lo & behold, after giving the complaint to Ford Customer Service, the part MAGICALLY appeared at the dealership THAT DAY when just 3 days before, there were NONE... in the entire United States!!!! REALLY????!!! Did they hire David Copperfield in the parts department ?!!!  To say their behavior is disgraceful would be an understatement!!!",1

When the time came to finalize the deal, the dynamics of the deal changed and we had to come up with $5000.00 above what we expected to pay.   Needless to say we decided not to do the deal, as a result, they refused to refund our $500.00 deposit. I understand this tactic is to force buyers into a deal, and if they have a deposit, they can change whats to be paid apparently, or else lose your deposit.  So were out 500.00 and be warned Dana customers... DO NOT give a deposit and DO NOT believe it will be refunded even if they tell you it will. The finance manager Mitch explained that they were keeping it because ""He had to do alot of work to get the deal done""?!?!  Im surprised a company like Ford operates like this.",1

Called the salesman Steve on Mon morning and told him we would be in at around 6:00pm to purchase the vehicle.  When we got there we waited a little bit because we were early and he had another customer.  We sat down with him and then it all went south.  He had no idea how much the lou had quoted me on sat and i could not remember the exact number.  I did ask for the number in writing on sat but the refused to give it to me.  After waiting in the dealership for over an hour my husband and i left.  I wanted $500 off the price they were offering me because i had to wait so long.  I spoke to Doug the General manager and he informed me that he would not reduce the price because he did not feel he should lose money on the deal.  Even though we know they are not losing money that is fine that he did not sell me the car.  For a manager Doug is very unprofessional and i'm not saying that because he refused to budge on the price because the funny part about it is if they would have had everything ready for us when we walked in we would have purchased the car for the original price.  I ended going to ALL American Ford and it was the best experience. We were offered coffee as soon as we walked in.  Our salesman Chuck was very helpful and knowledgeable.

2796,18-Mar-09,In response to scouter.. Well obviously you are connected to Dana Motors and Doug Hanson cause everyone I speak to has the same response.  They are a bunch of lying thieves.  The only reason they are still in business cause they are independently owned and Ford does not stand behind their product.  Obviously they are aware that they manufacture garbage and dont car what the dealers have to do to sell their cars. Unlike other manufacturers who would not allow this kind of behavior from a dealer representing their product.  And Dana Motors does not care who they screw or about the safety of their customers that they are putting in unsafe cars.  I guess they need to have someone get seriously hurt or die in an unsafe car that they sold or serviced under fraudulant circumstances to develop a conscious. ,1
2798,17-Mar-09,"Dana lincoln mercury is the worst dealership to deal with.  The employees and owner will do anything to take your money.  They make empty promises to make a sale.  Then when you have problems with the car, they resort to demeaning you in orfer that they think you will back down.  I purchased a 09 Flex which had problems with a leaking trans which they tried to fix but just made the problem worst.  Then the car had problems with the brakes that they could not fix and told me that it was under investigation by Ford which they stated in an Ro.  When I asked for a loner til the problem was fixed cause I did not feel safe in the car.  I was told by Alex that if the car won't stop to use my emergency brake- thats what there is for.  Their customers arenon-existent to them once you drive off their lot.   As Doug Hanson said if you want them to come thru on their promises then you should get them in writing cause they just make them to make a sale and dont intend on following thru. It s part of their business. Spoke with the owner who thinks he's a gangster and makes inappropiate remarks to try and cover his employee's mistakes.  He is not a honest businessman.  Don't see him surviving much longer with his attitude.  So if you want to buy a lemon and be abused in the process you should buy from them..  But I would recommend going to a dealer who cares.  There are plenty in New Jersey..   Thats where I got my new car that I am thrilled with and the service was great.",1

2800,13-Feb-09,"In March of 2008 I went to Dana Lincoln Mercury to purchase a Mercury Mariner.  When I found the truck that I liked I was asked to leave a deposit and fill out a credit application.  I left a $500 deposit on the truck and completed the credit application.  Unfortunately for me I was not approved for the truck from the leasing company and I was told I would need a co-signer.  Having someone co-sign was not an option for me.  When I called Tommy the sales person and told him that I didn't have a co-signer and inquired about my deposit I was told to come in for my deposit.  When I went in to pick up my deposit I was told that it could take up to 9 months to get back my deposit because deposits are usually nonrefundable.  I was NEVER told that when I was asked to leave a deposit nor did I sign anything stating that I was aware of this policy.  For almost a year now I have been calling DAILY inquiring about my deposit and have been given the run around.  I was told that they are looking into it, that they couldnt find my paperwork and proof of deposit (so I faxed them a copy of my check), you name it I was told it!!  Last week I was told that I was approved for the truck back in March of 2008 and that my deposit was nonrefundable.  That is ridiculous and a lie, I was told last year that I was NOT approved for the truck.  Now all of a sudden I was approved.  I am disgusted by how I was treated by Dana Lincoln Mercury and the nonsense I have been told for the past year.  I ended up purchasing my truck from Sansone Auto Mall where the sales people and managers could not have been nicer!!! I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE PURCHASING A VEHICLE FROM DANA LINCOLN MERCURY!!!

2801,27-May-08,"I purchased a loaded top of the line 08 MKX from Dana Lincoln Mercury on Staten Island.  All I kept hearing from Joe (the sales manager) was that the dealership was ranked top whatever in the country for the number of sales it made.  I really felt like the only thing that mattered was the volume the dealership was producing and not the quality of service it was providing.  They proved that as I had several problems upon delivery. Just to name a couple, the automatic start did not work and there were several scratches on the truck.  When I tried to have them rectified by Doug Hansen, this is some of what he said to me:

First off he was loud and obnoxious.  Upon seeing it, he said oh well it’s only about ½ inch big and nothing compared to the wear and tear that would happen.  No cars at any dealership including BMW, Mercedes or wherever have a perfect vehicle.  He started yelling at me and said he is not going to do anything about it.  If I wanted to have it painted he would do so or I should just leave the dealership.  The deal is done so goodbye.  He had work to do.  He didn’t know what I did for a living that I had so much time on my hands to research incentives available and know about dealer cash available.  No he did not give out free key rings or brochures and too bad about the scratch.  I already drove the car off the lot and it lost about $6,000 in value already.  He proceeded to walk away and said if I wanted his card, I could go ahead and complain to whoever the hell I wanted to.

2609,25-Aug-11,"Considering I had been to numerous dealerships over the last few months trying to decide what car I wanted next and when I finally settled on the 2012 Ford Mustang at first I went to Dana Ford since I live in Staten Island. In my opinion, what a mistake that was, they're sales reps that I dealt with were very cold, used poor sales tactics and were not willing to work with me at all in helping locate the car I wanted. They tried to tell me that they did a search and that there were no Mustang Base V6 models in black or kona blue in the entire Northeast Region and that I would have to special order it and it would take 6-8 weeks to get it in(Later found out from another Ford Dealer that there were actually 14 car they met what I was looking for within about 100miles). They then proceeded to push me towards a higher end mustang because they had it on the lot and it was a model that cost more and was a color I didnt even like, not to mention they gave me an inaccurate price quotes. They started with a price of $414/month with $2000 total due at signing. I asked if he could work with the price and then all of a sudden comes back with a price of $327/month for the V6 Premium model with only adding about $350 on top of what he originally said for a down payment and when I asked how go the price drop dramatically by $87/month he said it was due to a competitive leasing because I had a Honda lease that I turned in over 6 months ago. But as it turns out the competitive leasing rebate from Ford is only $1,000 credit which would only really drop the price by about $20/month not to mention according to Ford's website I wouldnt even qualify for that rebate because you have to had just returned or will be returning another lease within 30days. Then before I left they brought over the manager to try and tell me I should make a decision quick because someone else just took it out for a test drive right after me which was B.S. because we only had just returned with the keys. So after a horrible experience there I search the nearest Ford Dealers and came across Tom's Ford Lincoln. What a complete 180 turn from the experience I had at Dana Ford. In my opinion I highly recommend making the short ride over to Jersey for a better buying experience.",1.2

1242,07-Jan-17,"DO NOT EVER LEAVE A DEPOSIT on any vehicle with Dana Ford Lincoln of Staten Island. 
Upon receipt of my deposit, the salesman Jonathan Taylor and his manager at the time on 10/30/16, claimed that if I didn't take delivery of the vehicle, the refund was totally refundable. It was after 5 pm on a Sunday (the deposit receipt is dated 10/30/16 @ 5:22pm). The manager told me to just leave a deposit. As they were to be closed by 5pm already, and they told me they ""wanted to go home to watch football"". They basically took my deposit and pushed me out the door, with only a receipt for the Credit Card deposit transaction and NOTHING ELSE. No Buyers Order, no nothing.  Without a test drive, they lead me to believe that I needed to leave a deposit to secure the special low price on that particular vehicle with 0% financing. Told me that they will call me tomorrow after speaking to the bank about financing. Need less to say tomorrow came and noone called me back from Dana Ford Lincoln. So after work, I decided to call around for insurance quotes. Upon learning the high quotes I was getting from insurance companies to insurance this vehicle for full coverage, I decided to not purchase any new car at this current time. I called back the salesman Jonathan Taylor that day and told him I was not going to purchase that vehicle anymore. I explained to him about the high insurance quotes I was getting. I told him I will expect my deposit to be refunded. Jonathan then began to try to persuade me to still go ahead with the purchase. After a few attempts, he then tried to get me to drive to the dealer to meet with their insurance agents for a ""better quote""..  I then explained to him that after ten different insurance agents quoted about the same prices, I didn't feel the need to waste more time. Jonathan then tried to persuade me to look into a totally different vehicle that I was not interested in at all. I told him at this current time I will just like a refund of my deposit that they all assured me was possible. He told me he will have  Glenn Mahoney the General sales Manager call me back. After noone called me, I sent an email to Jonathan Taylor at 10pm on November 1, 2016, which to this day he has yet to return. On 12/30/16 while on three way calling with my Credit Card company and Dana ford Lincoln a cashier named IVY at ext.250, IVY promised me I will see a full refund back to my credit card with a couple days.  After not seeing the refund on my credit card, I called Dan Ford Lincoln back yesterday and  Today January 16, 2016 Glenn Mahoney just called and said he didn't know if the vehicle I had a deposit on was still in stock, and after 48 hours after a deposit is taken on it, if it is not delivered by then, he is allowed to sell it. Glenn Mahoney then Claimed there is NO REFUND GIVEN to an APPROVED SALE. How is it an approved sale if I never took delivery ?  Remind you I have a letter dated 10-31-16 in my house from Ford Credit  stating that the sale was not approved. So Glenn Mahoney and his staff at Dana Ford Lincoln of Staten Island believe they are entitled to keep my deposit and they never even started the vehicle up for me, never moved it from the same spot it was in.  Nothing !!!!
DO NOT EVER LEAVE A DEPOSIT ON A VEHICLE, THERE IS NO NEED TO.

1927,15-Jan-15,"I would have given them 0 Stars if possible.
On November 25th I experience my worst car buying experience ever.   After only looking at one vehicle and driving it(took a total of 20 minutes), I told the salesman that I would like to proceed buying that one(2011 Ford F150) ..keep in mind I did zero haggling...I specifically asked NOT to have my credit ran as I was going to go through USAA.  I was seated in his ""office"" area in the Lincoln side.   I do not know the name of my salesman because he quickly told me he had a sickness and the he had to leave.  He turned me over to someone else who was supposed to help me. Before he left I asked him to confirm that they received the loan paperwork from USAA as it was being faxed.  I never heard back from him.   I was asked however to move from the Lincoln office to the Ford side by  a different person.   I was in one of the sales cubicles for FORD for about 10 minutes when yet another salesman asked me to move to the ""bullpen"" area.  I said sure, but...can someone please confirm my USAA paperwork made it through.  They said they would check and escorted me to the bullpen area.   Never heard back from that gentleman about USAA.   About 30 minutes later a finance guy comes up to me and says that he can beat my USAA rate...I found this odd since he surely never ran my credit report since I specifically asked them not to...but bottom line I said ""no"", I would feel better just using USAA.  (Later I found out that they ran my credit report 10 times completely hurting that part of my score).   
10 minutes later the finance person comes back and says that if I go with the USAA method, I won't be able to buy the car today.   I found this really absurd and told him ""fine, I guess your dealership is the only dealership that has this dilemma"" and I prepared my stuff to depart.  A Finance Manager quickly found me and said that ""yes"" they can do the USAA method.   I then stayed in the bullpen area for another 2 hours straight with no one even checking on me.  NO TV in that area...just tables and chairs where I got to hear salesman talk to other customers about their private stuff, a DANA SALESMAN complain to another salesman for about 20 minutes on the fact that he wasn't doing anything that day because he heard he was going to get fired anyway....At this point I decided to go get something to eat since it didn't look like they were going to get to me any time soon, so I packed up my things to go eat...in which a salesman came running after me when I made it outside and told me ""they had been looking for me because I was next""...yeah right.   I could then go on to add they stupidity that followed based off the insurance that I had already switched over....but why bother.
SO HERE IS THE REST OF THE STORY.   THEY NEVER PROPERLY SUBMITTED MY PAPERWORK, SENT ME THE TITLE.  I NOW HAVE THE TRUCK, THE TITLE, BUT NOOOOO LOAN.   I FOUND THIS OUT WHEN I TRIED TO PAY THE LOAN THAT DOESN'T EXIST.  SO ON THE 26TH OF DECEMBER I CALLED TO HAVE THIS RECTIFIED.   I CALLED THE FIRST TIME, NO ONE CALLED ME BACK.  I CALLED THE SECOND TIME, GOT AHOLD OF A SALES MANAGER WHO WAS SUPRISED BY THE SITUATION, AND WAS GOING TO GET BACK TO ME QUICKLY.  TWO HOURS LATER, I CALLED BACK BECAUSE I HADN'T HEARD ANYTHING.  THE RECEPTIONIST TOLD ME THAT THE SAME SALES MANAGER SAID HE KNOWS ABOUT THE PROBLEM AND WILL CALL ME BACK.  IT IS NOW THE 15TH OF JANUARY...AND I HAVE STILL NOT RECIEVED A PHONE CALL.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!!!

2340,11-Mar-13," I can't believe I gave my business to this this place when I could have spent less and went somewhere else. Ronny P was pleasant to work with and he definitely gave me a great buying experience. Once the paper was signed everything just went downhill. I did not hear from this dealership for two full weeks, and I had to call many times and ask what was taking so long to only find out Ronny had resigned and no one decided to let me know that my car was ready for delivery. Let me say i was tossed around like crazy before a sales manager decided to finally give me an update. When i did receive my car there were scratches on the door and all the windows were manual. It is 2013 why do you have to roll down your windows? It is my fault for not doing the right research and giving this place too much trust.

It took more than 45 days and multiple calls before I received my license plates. Even after they had promised that they would send me the license plates via fedex, they tried to make me pay for shipping. I am actually still angry thinking about the experience I had even after many months. The only reason I am editing this rating is because I felt bad that Ronny had to be part of this rating when it was not actually his fault, it was the lack of communications between all departments that really makes me not want to come back to this dealership. Dana provided the bare minimum and they expect me to give them a 5 star rating.",1.4
2411,03-Dec-12,"I came to the dealership to lease a new Ford Fusion 2013. I took a test drive, decided on the color and model and sat down with Mr. White to negotiate a deal. We came to an agreement, and in order to confirm it with the manager he asked for a credit card to show that we were ""serious about making this deal"". The manager okay'ed the deal and came over to shake our hand, everything was done. I paid the money down and was set to come back two days later to pick up the car. I asked for a copy of the agreement, but was told that I would receive it when I came for the car. I found this shady. An hour before the time that I was supposed to pick up the car I called to confirm and was told that everything was set. I came back to get the car and was suddenly told that they had made a ""mistake"".i was absolutely outraged that they were going back on the deal that we had made and they refused to give us what we agreed on. They tried to sell us a different car,  wasn't what we came for so we left with no deal. This was a huge inconvenience as we really needed a car at the time that we made the deal and instead it took us another week before we could get to another dealer. We went to a great dealership in Manhattan and in three hours we left driving a new car with just about the same deal that we had originally made at DANA. I will never be going back to DANA again. EVERYONE STAY AWAY FROM UNPROFESSIONAL AT DANA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1.4
2666,03-May-11,"Let me start off by saying I never complain about service anywhere and quite opposite, I will call owners, managers, etc of businesses I deal with just to tell them I was happy with whatever I received. But with that said, NEVER in my life of purchasing 6+ cars has there ever, ever been such a horrendous experience. Without going into the full experience, I was purchasing their highest end truck when I confirmed SEVERAL times that it was a 'limited edition' they were bringing in from another dealership, but something didnt add up since the sales girl (no longer there) told me she researched the car and it was not. All my internet searches supported the same. I wanted confirmation via the window sticker that the senior manager initially told me he couldn't provide since it was a truck they were bringing in. Once I told him I would not purchase it there if I couldnt see a sticker, miraculously he faxed one over to me in about 10 minutes but forgot to remove the other dealerships name from the bottom!! Of course, I called that dealership and they said 'NO' it was not the limited. Once I politely confronted him, he got indignant and HUNG UP on me. Would you want this person helping you or representing  your business?
 
I then went to Flemington Ford in NJ (had the best experience of any dealership I have ever dealt with) as SEVERAL people on the Island recommended them and after exhaustive research they were able to find me one. After a few months, my car needed a SIMPLE update to the map/direction system so my Flemington sales person said it was really standard so to bring it here. It took 3 days AND CAME BACK WITH SCRATCHES ON THE FRONT BUMPER. Couple that with it covered in mud outside and in the drivers seat and my tire pressure light on I was outraged, yet remained calm. Bottom line is I brought it back AGAIN for body shop work, cleaning and to reset the tire light I told was just a computer adjustment. 3RD time there, scratches were fixed, car FILTHY and light still on. Once again, I was apologized to for the dirt and they would send somebody out to pick it up and bring it back which didnt happen for two weeks. Following this I brought my car to a gas station only to find that a VISIBLE nail was in my tire, hence the reason for the light. 4 WEEKS LATER they have FINALLY fixed the tire and have cleaned it!! Seriously, I have heard horror stories from people on the Island which is why Flemington (on average) sees 1 person a week from here!!!!! ",1.5

At first the service seemed great but upon leaving the lot the window on the car I just purchased didn't roll back up. I was told to come in 2 days after to have it fixed. After driving from nj to Staten Island the part wasn't available yet and I had to drive back home and was told it would be available 3 days after. When I called 3 days after the service department told me I had to make an appointment for the following week?! After being transferred and called back several times I had to work around they're schedule in order to have my car serviced in a timely manor. After 5 hours the job was ""done"" they supposedly detailed the car but they're terms of detailing and mine must very different. Now 2 weeks later I find I was sold a car with so many problems. A leak somewhere causing the antifreeze to leak, the windshield wiper fluid tank is cracked, and none of the fluid were topped off before selling the car to me. I think it's ridiculous this dealership would sell a car to someone as certified preowned and not service the parts of the car that needed to be fixed before selling it to a customer.

1209,01-May-17,"Besa was extremely rude, and unprofessional. Rather than trying to provide service for mine and my husbands vehicle, she was trying to service my husband instead. Anytime she received new information about the status of our car she chose not to share it with me but only with my husband. While in the waiting room she approached me to let me know that she was looking for my husband to talk to him. At the time he stepped outside to make a job related call. I told her that and we would find her when he came back so we can get the update together. Instead she insisted that she speak to him in private and chased him down outside cause she's use to ""walking the floor"", her words not mine. The entire time she was rude and had an attitude with me and being flirtatious with my husband. And to make matters worse before we left, my husband was walking in front of me and she decides to cut me off and  inappropriately touched him and interlocked her arm unto his as if they were a couple.  I told her never touch my husband again. But what I should have done was tell her manager since he was right there, so he could know just what she had done. All this would show if you check the cameras for Friday April 28,2017.   I was baffled by how this woman could be hired to work at the dealership when she was acting In such a grotesque manner. I was appalled and not to mention disrespected and my husband was sexually harassed for which made him uncomfortable. I hope that no one else has to deal with her unprofessionalism and that her management will deal with her accordingly like they would if a man would have done this.

2437,02-Oct-12,"I have waited almost 7 weeks to write this review because of issues that I had and still have it with my 2012 f150 3.5 Platinum. My hell started during the purchase process, Dana Ford in Staten Island did a great job to make my life miserable during this whole process. I purchased my truck on Friday and I made my decision based on reviews found on the Internet about the F150, I tried a couple dealers before the purchase and finally made a decision to get it at this dealer because I found the one I wanted there. During the purchase process we reached an agreement and the truck was delivered to me with out the proper delivery process, the salesman and managers kept telling me several times about filling out this survey Ok or excellent for them. I received very little information about the truck; they didn’t explain all the truck features or worse the specifics about it. When I got home the first thing I found out was the truck was larger than the one I traded in (Toyota Tundra Limited) and I couldn’t close my garage and got very upset because I found out that night that this one was longer than my previous truck, I felt it during the ride from the Dealer in New York to my house in New Jersey. Very unhappy about it I made my own Internet research and found out the truck comes in different sizes like 145” and 157” long and comparing to my old one I needed the 145”. When you spend a lot of money on a car, you want to get what you paid for and you want to get what you want and the truck that makes you happy, this wasn’t the case for me with this truck because It felt longer and It wasn’t the one I wanted. I made the wrong decision to go back to the dealer and get the truck I wanted, the 145” that’s the truck size I been driving the last 5 years for almost every day. Back at the Dealer with 54 miles on the truck odometer, the salesman and the sales manager, first thing they did is to look for a way to take advantage of the situation and tried to get more money from me. After I checked others F150s with different specifics and one with a lower price of about $ 1,200.00, they proposed to me to sell me the new one and trade the one I got the day before with 54 miles on the Odometer and pay them on top 2,800.00 to get the 145” size truck. I got very upset because in the way they wanted to do business with the newer truck they were clearly taking advantage and telling me in my face that I was stupid, that’s how I felt and that’s how I still feel.
After all discussions making the deal, which in the first place I thought they would just exchange the truck for me and any money difference will be paid either by me or by them depending on lower or higher price of the new one. They sold me the $ 1,200.00 lower price truck at the same price for my first purchase, so I knew I was loosing that money, having me in a place that I didn’t know what to do with a truck I didn’t want, I accepted to buy the 2nd. Truck, very, very unhappy I signed the papers and drove home with the other one. They did the same thing with the second truck, gave me a pre-filled delivery truck sheet with all the options crossed out saying the truck is Ok, repeatedly saying to me “to make sure when I get the Survey I should fill it with all excellent for them because depending on that survey will be the salesman’s payment “. When receiving the truck I found the leather of the console top in the truck was scratched and asked the salesman to be addressed at what he immediately responded they will order a new cover and replace it, the salesman brought his Customer Relations Manager to take a look at it, then he affirmed that they will put a new piece on and they will call me to schedule it.
Waiting for almost a week I made a decision to call the dealer and ask for the console cover and also talk to them about what I found on the truck tailgate. The Platinum F150 tailgate cover was coming off on one corner, I spoke to the salesman and the first thing he answered to me after listening to my complain about the tailgate is saying “ that is your responsibility because the truck has been with you for almost 1 week”, unfortunately not the best professional answer for a customer. Anyway I made an appointment to bring the truck to the dealer to check it, but before my appointment the truck steering wheel column started to make a grinding noise, a clear sign that something is wrong with it. I came to the dealer and spoke to the salesman about it, they were not happy that I was complaining and bringing something new to the table. A technician checked the truck and agreed that something is wrong with the steering wheel column but proceeded to tell me that I should wait a little longer and see if the noise goes away and that they will check it again on the day my truck will be on service for the console top and tailgate cover. Made an appointment for the following week to change the top of the console, fix the tailgate cover and check the steering wheel column again. Basically they gave a very hard time to fix my truck, they never called back when they said they would, they wanted to do touch up work on everything since day one, wanted to buff up my console cover, they patched tape the tailgate cover and they didn’t want to fix the steering wheel column they told me that I should have some tolerance on this issues because every truck and car always will have some imperfections. After many calls to Ford Customer Relations Team I had the luck to talk to some people who helped me one way or the other, Cynthia McGregor helped a lot and I thanked her, but sometimes even for her this problem got very difficult. After all this complaining, they finally changed the console cover, they replaced the steering wheel column but during this work in the shop they scratched the 2 covers of the steering wheel base, scratched my truck left mirror and front bumper. Lastly this last week I had to insist and try to get my registration and plates ready because I been asking all these passed 5 weeks but they didn’t have my name on file either, that’s what the ladies at that department said to me when they were asked for my papers and plates from me. It took almost 6 weeks and my calls to Cynthia (Manager from Customer Relations Team), for them to get it ready but I have argued many times before with Kendra and the other authorities at the dealer to get my truck registration and plates ready. She even hung up on me on the phone once because they couldn’t keep their promises to have the registration and plates ready at the day they said it would be ready.
Last week I brought my truck to have the steering wheel cups replaced because they scratched it when replacing the steering wheel column, they also replaced the tailgate cover and sucked at it, they installed the new one incorrectly because now I have the same issue on the opposite side of the tailgate cover (Left side). Lastly one of the Sales Manager had the audacity to come to me and confront me asking “Why I have given them a bad survey, because the only thing he had done for me was Help ” That shocked me because I wouldn’t expect that from a Manager (I found out his name is Juan and he speaks Spanish, I don’t know his last name) because he would be the right person to know what their errors and mistakes were with me when purchasing the truck and with the dealer Customer Service.
My truck tailgate still looks awful with factory quality control issues, but one thing I’m sure is that never, never in my life will I go back to this dealer and buy a car from them. Because for me to go through this hell, it has been a huge nightmare and I don’t want anybody to pass it, I have been aggravated more than too many times during all this process, they disrespected me not doing/fixing things on time and in a professional manner what they had to do in the first place. They didn’t try to do what they promised to do, of course they did something but they did it because Cynthia and myself had to be there to push them to do it.
Just to let you know how un-professional they are I’m going to let you know that this weekend when having my truck washed at the carwash when the truck was getting dried, the Tailgate rear Ford emblem fell off, at this point I didn’t know if I should scream, cry or just pray to god for better days for me with this truck. For your information Rich at the Dealer Shop showed me that they will need to take a part the tailgate to replace that cover and that’s what they did, I saw it with my own eyes because I was brought to see part of the process, I saw they took the emblem off and other parts too to install the new tailgate cover but when they did this, they broke the emblem tabs and to put it back they just pushed the emblem in but the emblem never was going to hold on to its base because the tabs were broken, It held it a little but not enough to support the wind coming from the carwash blower. Now the emblem is all scratched off because it fell on the carwash track chain.
I will place reviews of this dealer on all the places I can like Google and other search engines, because I do not wish for other customers to get what I got in this dealer. The last thing I would like to say is that I hope Ford comes to me and calls me to get all these issues resolved but It will have to be at a different Ford dealer, I’m not coming back to this dealer again in my life.


Good Bye

2479,18-Aug-12,"I am a former customer of Dana Ford. I have been called in the past three months about turning in my leased Edge. When I ask questions about new payments or are my remaining payments going to be rolled nto the new ones, I get no answer. Last week I received another call and again my questions were not answered and I was told my salesman still worked there. Well much to my pleasure I am now a customer of BAYRIDGE FORD. I have my new 2013 Edge fully loaded and with less of a payment. By the way I don't like being lied to since I found out my salesman now works at Manhatten Ford. Too bad we lost Island Ford but I am glad I found Bayridge Ford. Too bad the personnel at DANA aren't schooled in how to treat customers. All they want is the sale at any cost regardless of what the customer wants. They are ""helpful"" whan they make the deal and then when you go back for your registration, they don't even look at you. A generated letter is sent out, but it's the same for all customers to see if you like your new car. Too bad we lost ISLAND FORD but I am glad we now have BAYRIDGE FORD. It's worth the toll!",1.8
2557,02-Nov-11,"We bought our brand new 2011 Ford Explorer ($40k) from Dana in July.  The dealership since has been uncooperative in issuing a military incentive promised by Ford at the time of purchase. The incentive was for $500 and both the dealership and Ford Motor Co. customer service have given us a run around for months. Both have ignored our requests and when reaching out to Dana Ford we get the ""eye rolling why are you bothering us"" response.

Additionally, at the time of the sale we were promised the all weather mats and were once again given the run around for weeks before a sales manager realized how stupid it is for them to make a big deal out of $60 mats. 

To add insult to injury, we have already serviced the Explorer twice.  Once
for a ""loose wire""  that caused the rear A/C to go in and out sporadically
and just recently another issue with the cooling fan needing replacement.

I would never go back to Dana ford to purchase a vehicle or to service the current one.

Should have went with the Honda Pilot. Dealing with Ford is like dealing with a call center in another country ... useless.

2789,14-Nov-09,Waited for two hours for an oil change when I had an apt set.  Not only did I have to wait a long time but they were not so nice about making me wait so long.  They told me they thought 2 hours was a compltely accpetable amount of time to wait and I would have waited even longer if I had a Honda.  To top it off they were going to charge me $100 for an oil change.  I should have gone to jiffy lube and got an oil change for $30 and waited 20 minutes.  I love my MKX but don't think I would buy another one becasue the service is just so bad,1.8
2807,18-Aug-05,Tired of constant recalls every time I purchased a new car.  Service is slow.  Salesmen dull.  Constant e-mail and phone calls when they think it's time for your next purchase.  Registered complaint with Corporation.  No satisfaction.  Salesman stated he was trying to meet sales for the end of the month.,1.8
122,29-Oct-19,Tiffany was in contact with me for months keeping up to date on the new Lincoln trucks I was interested in! Super informative professional and helpful..... Dana Lincoln Is lucky to have her!,2
1210,01-May-17,"I called about bringing my 12 Mustang GT in for a recall service. They said bring it in on the 18th of April (I called on the 10th) so they could make sure they had the part ready to go. Not only  didn't they have the part, but there were some other warning lights on that they were supposed to look into, which they could have looked at while they waited for the recall part and didn't. Long story short, they had the car 4 days for 1 1/2 days worth of repairs.Then they try to make lame excuses. unfortunately I know cars and computers and I called them on their lies.",2
1395,18-Feb-16,"After bringing my car in to dana ford service on Thursday February 11th I received the car back on Wednesday February 17th. All that needed to be done was tire pressure sensor reset, horn to be fixed, and noise when turning the steering wheel. I called several times for updates and was promised a call back on more than 5 occasions, finally on the 6th attempt I received a phone call back, this was over the course of 4 days.

After finally getting my car back and getting home, I noticed that the bumper wasnt fully on. They forgot to put retaining screws into the wheel well liner and under the bumper causing the liner to drag and scrape my tire. After calling about this I was told to come in within 30 minutes and it will be taken care of right away. I came in and was told it will be an hour or two to put in the 6 screws missing. I said thats ridiculous and asked them for the screws and that I would do it myself. They happily provided me with the screws and I laid on the floor in the service center screwing in these screws by hand.

Oh and they promised that the techs checked the fluid level but the anti freeze was never refilled so I had them do that when I came back as well. 

In summary this experience was on the level of some shady mechanic and not something one would expect from a dealership.",2
1892,27-Feb-15,"As soon as you sign the papers you are immediately forgotten.  If you have a problem, there is no way to contact Dana.  Phone calls are never returned.   When you go in person, the manager's are NEVER available.  We will never buy another Ford from Dana Staten Island.",2
2540,27-Dec-11,"The day I purchased the vehicle was a great experience. It was what happened after I got the car that made this an awful experience.  I purchased the car in mid-November and it is now late December and I still have not received my permanent license plate and registration.  About once every week since purchasing my car, I was contacted by a customer rep to make sure I completed the dealership surveys with great reviews (which I did) and each time I asked about the status of my plate.  I was consistently told that it wasn't in yet, but could take up to 45 days.  When I was contacted last week, I asked about the plate and registration and I was told to call back at the end of the week, which I did.  It was on this phone call (2 days before Christmas) that I was finally told my paperwork was still in the dealership and that they needed 2 copies of papers from me.  Not ONCE was I informed of this during previous calls.  The paperwork had been sitting in the dealership for 5 weeks and had not yet been sent to the DMV.  My temporary license plate was issued on Nov 16th, so it is due to expire in a couple of days.  After speaking with the Pennsylvania Parking Authority, I was told that if stopped or ticketed, my car would be taken if the plate was expired.  I also could not renew the temporary parking permit I have been getting to park in the city while I wait for the permanent plate to get a yearly pass.  I am now stuck with no parking permit and risk being ticketed or losing my car while I wait for the dealership to finally put the paperwork through.  I was told there is nothing they can do until they get the plates in and that there was just a lot of paperwork that needed to be done for an out of state registration.  I can understand that it takes a little, but that time is on top of the 5 weeks they did nothing about my paperwork.  I also wonder where the representative was looking when I asked about the status of my plate every time she called.",2
2729,23-Nov-10,"Absolute worst service department ever.  You make an appointment bring in your car and then don't bother to look at it all day. They then have the nerve to ask you to reschedule or leave your car there until whenever they decide to get around to looking at it. They do not provide loaner cars (unless car is kept over a day but at that point you are already out of a car all day and you can't even get a comparable car).  I never had these issues at Bay Ridge Lincoln and I am so sorry to see them closed; always had a loaner as soon as I dropped off my vehicle and vehicle was always looked at during appointment.  Car was never returned to me with dirt and oil marks inside and out either.

This dealer rating is complete crap as well because they actually tell you to rate them 5* when you purchase or lease your vehicle.  So I can see many people have obliged.",2
567,08-Dec-18,"My experience here was not good. Recently I was trading in 2016 Explorer Limited and knew I wanted the new Sport Edition. Knew going in what the price per month I would be dealing with since I have leased many times before (not my first car guys). Well anyway, the price that the guy behind the glass came up with was totally outrageous and when I called him
Out on it he just made me feel uncomfortable. Kept telling me what a great deal I was getting and what a huge favor they were doing for me. I didn’t like the vibe. It was very pushy. Even more than your typical dealership. The manager definitely lost me when he was telling me I had to purchase the car that day or else it wasn’t going to help them. (It was was last day of the month.) Um news flash guys- customers do not care about your sales. They care about what they can afford and what is going to benefit their budget. Could not care any less about how many sales Dana makes. Just want to walk away in a nice car- without getting ripped off.
Rich Harley (sales) is nice- very patient and will drive through the entire lot of cars for you. He should get out of that dealership!
Price was outrageous! Went to All American and got the same exact car nearly $90 per month cheaper! Great experience there-would recommend! ",2.2
1344,06-May-16,"They overcharged my credit card - admitted the mistake - claimed they refunded my card and never did..  At the time they actually produced a paper showing they issued a credit - which they never really did.

1959,28-Dec-14,"I am sorry that I ever wrote a positive review of this place.  While my salesman was excellent, the staff at this dealership are severely lacking in clerical and customer support skills.  I phoned two weeks after my purchase to ensure that my registration documentation was properly filed (I do not live in NY), and they told me that there were missing items.  That's right, I had to call them to find out that some documentation was missing.  What was missing?  A copy of the back of my driver's license, which they could have easily obtained at any point.  That, and they mentioned that the effective date of my insurance was wrong.  To recap, they made the phone call to organize the insurance change.  This is all after an e-mail the day after my purchase to double check that they didn't need anything additional from me.  I needed the registration process to be expedited, as my neighborhood is resident permit parking only.  Now my registration is delayed another two weeks, during which time I cannot park in my neighborhood.  To make everything more frustrating, everyone I spoke to on the phone was pretty rude, and didn't really care about taking care of me.  I mean, what do they have in it?  They already sold me a car.

As a side note, Rich was a great salesman.",2.2
2229,04-Feb-14,"I had a 2011 ford escape limited in 4x4 which I leased from dana. My lease was up so I went to get another one.I told the salesman I wanted a 4x4 like my last one he asked if I would consider a fwd I said no we made a deal I asked the salesman if it was fwd or 4wd  I wanted to be sure I was told I was told 4wd, as a matter of fact the salesman told me over and over how I was getting so much more truck for the same price. Well as it turns out less than a week later we get some snow, I jump into my truck and proceed to get stuck, now that never happened with my old truck so I dig out the window sticker that the dealer had removed and put in the glove box before we picked up the car and I find that it dosen't have 4wd at all. I called the dealer to ask about why I was told it was a 4x4  when its not. I was told I could not have been told that as no way I could have gotten a 4x4 for that price. I was lied to and missled just to make a deal nothing matters but to make a sale. 

",2.3
2582,28-Sep-11,"I walked into this dealership and was greeted by a salesman who seemed pleasant in the beginning.  We discussed two trucks that I was interested in test driving.  I was very happy with the enthusiasm he had even after I explained that I may not be able to give a large down payment today. I unfortunately was not sure that today would be the day to make a deal but I was rather inquiring so that I could be prepared in the next month or two to sign a lease if they were not able to work with little money down. As we sat down after test driving the ford escape things seemed okay and still felt positive by telling me that ""miracles are going to happen today"".  As he starting negotiating he explained that my trade financed car would be worth 6,000.  I respect the fact that he wanted to make a sale, but my advice to this dealership is to worry about selling cars and making miracles rather than lying to the customer.  I carefully explained that I could not have a payment higher than 400 per month, so how does 573 a month and 2400 down today even close to what I was telling him I could afford.  I really thought that this dealership would be better than where I bought the current car I have but I guess enthusiastic sales people who give false hope is really what you promote. In about a month I will be on my search again and with money to put down going to a dealership in New jersey!",2.3
2717,05-Jan-11,"I went to Dana after receiving calls from them to terminate a previous lease that I had with them and on a 2008 Linoln MKX and to upgrade to a 2011 Lincoln MKX. I was told that there were great end of year programs available and that I would get a great deal on a new lease. I met with a salesman, Steve Nilsen, who showed me vehicles that I was interested in with available option packages. He was great and sincere throughout the whole process and truly did try to work out a deal. He quoted a fair price for a new lease that was agreed upon by his manager Dave. I did not complete the contract at that time because I was unsure of the color that my wife wanted but I told Steve that I would return later in the day with my wife to purchase a vehicle. He assured me, after talking with Dave, that the price that we had negotiated would be honored when I return. I returned later that day with my wife. Dana did not have the color that she wanted (merlot) but she settled on her 2nd choice which was black. When I sat with Steve to draw up the contract things began to unravel. He got some paperwork from Dave and all of a sudden, the down payment did not include the first lease payment but earlier in the day it had. The next thing I knew was that I was no longer talking to Steve but was talking to Lou. He agreed that the first lease payment would be included but suddenly the monthly payment went up $43. We began to haggle back and forth. Finally he came down close to the original price but was still $14 over the earler price Steve had guaranteed through Dave. He cited that the difference was due to some accessories that I had wanted and that Steve had promised to include at no cost because I had waited around he showroom for 2 1/2 hours past my appointment time to meet with Steve and I was not getting my first choice of color. Finally, I agreed to pay the higher amount but was really not happy about it. I gave Steve my credit card for a down payment. While he was processing the payment Dave came by to talk to me. I told him that I really felt that he should have given me the car at the earlier agreed price. After a brief discussion he told me rather nastily that if I wasn't happy with the deal, I should leave. Unfortunately, I did not. I returned 2 days later to pick up my new MKX. When I met with Steve he said the car was detailed and went to check on the vehicle. He came back and then informed me that there was damage to the front bumper
(it had been scuffed and chipped). He was very apologetic and said that they would give me a loaner car and have the bumper repaired and repainted. He assured me that it would be as good as new.  I told him I was not comfortable with paying for a new car and receiving a repaired one. He then offered to give me another MKX exactly the same as the one that I was purchasing. I agreed but Steve returned 10 minutes later and informed me that it was sold and there were no other black MKX's available on the lot. He asked if I would take a different color but there were no other colors on the lot that I was interested in. Steve went to the office and Lou came over. He was rather nasty and could not understand why I didn't want to take the car after was repaired. I explained that I was paying for a new car not a repaired car and that if he wanted me to take a repaired car he would have to drop the price. He refusd to do so. I told him to terminated the deal and for my credit card account to credited. He said fine and walked away. Then Dave came over to me. Our interaction was the same as the one I had with Lou. He too was rather nasty and independent. There was no negotiation. It was going to be be his way or no way. I would not give in so he agreed to credit my account and cancel the deal. I left, went to Tom's Ford Lincoln Mercury, and had a great experience. I got the color I wanted (Merlot) at a better price with no hassle and was treated professionally and with respect.  ",2.3
2181,30-May-14,"I leased a brand new Ford Taurus - covered already by a 36 month factory warranty - I was sold (full price) on a 100,000 mile protection plan at the cost of $2,495 - with the contention that if I turned the lease in, I would get a full refund.
I never received a copy of the warranty, and turns out, it was only a 60,000 mile extended warranty, running concurrent with the factory warranty - and at lease end - 24 months and 36,000 miles later, I only received $1,000 refund.  
Why would I buy a warranty when I was already covered?  Because I was told it was a ""no lose"" situation - I'd get it all back if I turned the car in.
No response from dealership after complaining about the issue - followed up again - no response again.
I have since leased TWO more Ford vehicles, an Explorer and a new Taurus SHO - NOT from this dealership.
My impression is that this dealership cares about money only, not their customers.

2361,02-Feb-13,"First and last time I will ever do business with this dealer. Every step of the process was flawed. What I saved in dollars is not worth the overall headaches that came in completing this trasaction. You get onetime to make a first impression, and my first impression is not very good. I guess you pay for what you get. Cheap is not always the best. Lesson learned. The only positive of this deal is the effort of Frank Curry. This man was a complete gentlemen and tried to make this negative into a positive. ",2.5
2559,31-Oct-11,"    Recently, I purchased a car from Dana Ford.  A salesperson asked me to do him a favor.  He said in his E-mail, &amp;amp;quot;There's a website &amp;amp;quot;Dealer Rated.come/rateus that folks use to learn about car dealers.  We rely on views like yours to keep us going.&amp;amp;quot;  As for myself, I prefer to take the wait-and-see approach before rating a car dealer.  I am so glad I did.
     Initially, I had a great experience at Dana Ford.  The staff was very friendly.  Frank Curry and Richard Harley helped me with the purchase of my vehicle.  They were very professional, courteous, and a pleasure to deal with.  In short, they did A+ work.  It is too bad the rest of my experience with Dana Ford wasn't A+ as well.
     A short time after the puchase, I realized Dana Ford overcharged the amount of documentary fees(plates and registration) and was due a $152.00 dollar refund. Not a lot of money but still my money.   So I call them up and was told my  money  they overcharged me would be returned to me.  Days and weeks go bye and still no money.  I call up again and I am told my money is on its way.  Finally, I receive my check six weeks later after the purchase.  However, on the back of the check there is a disclaimer on back that states in capital letters:  &amp;amp;quot;IN FULL SETTLEMENT OF ALL CLAIMS AGAINST DANA MOTORS LTD.&amp;amp;quot;  My first reaction was, What's This?  Why would I want to put my John Hancock on something that states, &amp;amp;quot;IN FULL SETTLEMENT OF ALL CLAIMS....&amp;amp;quot;  So I call Dana Ford up and have been told it is their policy to issue their checks this way.  In fact, I was told the checks are preprinted that way but that is clearly not the case since the DISCLAIMER LANGUAGE was STAMPED---NOT PREPRINTED. I point this out to Tony, a manager, and he said there is nothing he could do.  I politely remind him it's MY MONEY-MY MONEY and I would  like it back with no strings attached. 
      In a nutshell, I told them I would sign the check if they were to reword the language as such:  &amp;amp;quot;IN FULL SETTLEMENT AS IT PERTAINS TO THE OVERCOLLECTION OF DOCUMENTARY FEES&amp;amp;quot;  Otherwise, why would I want to sign something that states, &amp;amp;quot;IN FULL SETTLEMENT OF ALL CLAIMS....&amp;amp;quot;  Now hypothetically speaking:  What if I were to find out I was overcharged elsewhere by DANA FORD?  Woundn't I POTENTIALLY be giving up that claim as well? Hypothetically speaking again: What if there was something wrong with the car or something that should have been disclosed about the car and wasn't( FOR EXAMPLE,THE CAR HAD FLOOD DAMAGE AND THEY KNEW ABOUT IT AND DID NOT DISCOSE IT)?  Would I be giving up that claim as well?   DANA FORD COULD NOT ANSWER OR EXPLAIN WHAT THE DISCLAIMER LANGUAGE ACTUALLY MEANT.  I FOUND THAT VERY CURIOUS.  BASICALLY THEY SAID WAS JUST TO SIGN THE CHECK.  In my opinion, if you ever have to file a claim it may cost a lot more in legal fees for a lawyer to determine what was meant bye signing a check which in very general language  states, &amp;amp;quot;IN FULL SETTLEMENT OF ALL CLAIMS AGAINST DANA MOTORS.&amp;amp;quot;   What happens if there is some type of problem with the purchase? If the lawyer sees the money returned was for being overcharged specifically, he or she does not have to worry about the general, &amp;amp;quot;IN FULL SETTLEMENT OF ALL CLAIMS...&amp;amp;quot; nonsence. As a result, and based on principle, I REFUSE TO SIGN SOMETHING LIKE THAT--- AND BYE THE WAY THE MONEY I WAS OVERCHARGED IS MY MONEY-MY MONEY------ DANA FORD---EVEN IF THE AMOUNT OWED IS NOT A LARGE SUM.  
     Consequently, I contacted the New York department of Consumer Affairs and there response was try to work it out--sounds very reasonable to me.  Thus,  I called Dana Ford back, but to no avail.  They did not call, e-mail, or fax me any information.  Dave Dioro, a manager, said he could not help me.  So I had to contact the New York Department of Consumers Affairs again. In short, HORRIBLE HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE  --IN REALITY HORRIBLE HORRIBLE MANAGEMENT SERVICE.   To put the situation nicely: SHAME ON YOU DANA FORD-SHAME ON YOU!!!!!  To be quite sure, I would like the return of my money without any general discaimer language that states...IN FULL SETTLEMENT OF ALL CLAIMS...&amp;amp;quot;
     If I have to go to court I will, although i think the situation is very unfortunate. I was told by management their lawyer said this disclaimer language was appropriate for overerpayment but I disagree.  I asked them to fax or mail me information as to what IN FULL SETTLEMENT OF ALL CLAIMS ...actually means by their lawyer but they said they WOULD not do it. The obvouis question is why not? I firmly believe this was a reasonable request.  In a nutshell, to make you jump through hoops to have them return your own money is plain---WRONG.  So if you are going to purchase a car from Dana Ford or any other car dealer, I would wait-and-see before you rate them.  Initially, they are very happy to take YOUR MONEY.  Also, know what you are signing.  Time will tell if you are truly happy with a dealer. For example, What happens if you are overcharged, or car has some mechanical issues and you need servicing? Their reponse and actions are critical to overall dealer performance.  I sincerely hope this letter will help future car purchasers. REMEMBER, A DEALER'S RATING MAY BE ENHANCED IF THEY ARE AGGRESIVE ENOUGH TO  ENCOURAGE YOU TO WRITE A REVIEW SHORTLY AFTER YOUR PURCHASE WHEN YOU ARE GENERALLY HAPPY AND THE DEALER IS HAPPY TO HAVE YOUR MONEY.  YOU WILL NOTICE THE DEALER-RATER BROCHURES AT DANA FORD AND THEY MAY ASK YOU TO RATE THEM.   IN MY OPINION, YOU SHOULD TAKE A WAIT-AND-SEE APPROACH. THUS, THE DEALER RATING MAY BE POTENTIALLY MORE ACCURATE.  HAD I RATED DANA FORD INITIALLY AFTER PURCHASING THE CAR THEIR SCORE WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH HIGHER.

2643,28-Jun-11,"Inquired about a 2011 Ford Fiesta with Remote start, 6-spd auto trans, and a dealer package that includes a bunch of bells and whistles (203a). Was told by Mike Price they had it in stock and could come in a test drive it. 10 Minutes later I get a call back stating he was wrong about having that specific car in stock but had the same model available for a test drive, from there they can order the car if I am then ready for a purchase. So far so good. Went for the test drive and I really liked the car. The one they had in stock (or course) is more expensive: the SEL vs. the SE and has the moon-roof: do not want; leather interior package: oh, no; the 301a package: fancy auto detect features with push-button start: no thanks; wrong color: it's black and I want the Silver metallic. I like the test drive, we iron out the package, and then I give the OK to order My New Car -that is when it all goes south. They cannot order the 2011. They can order the 2012. They don't have any information on the car, do not have any in stock, can't show me what it looks like, do not know when the car is coming in, but they are 'willing' to sell the more expensive 2012 to me if I am 'willing' to order it sight-unseen, un-tested and un-driven.
He knew what I was coming in for, said it was no problem, then when we are just about there with a deal: they switch the car and won't budge. Said they 'just found out today',... 'it's not our fault. It's Fords.'
So, they new they could not order or get the car I wanted before I came in, chose not to tell me about the issue, let me go through the whole production of setting everything up, and then sprang it on me at the end?
I was no longer interested in a deal because of how this played out. He had taken my car keys while they checked the car for trade-in value, but I did not see anyone near my car while I waited for 15-20 minutes. I asked for my keys and it was like pulling teeth getting them back. I let him and his boss firmly know I am not willing to make a deal on a car I cannot see, feel, smell, taste, get pricing for through the Auto Buying program, and most importantly test drive. After 5 or so minutes of back-and-forth in the parking lot after repeatedly requesting my keys Mike Price finally gave them to be but did not hand them over before stating, 'just so you know... we're in that time of year.....' ...when the 2011s are not available for ordering because of new 2012 roll-out. So he knew, or is an after-the-fact rationalization? He has this snarky tone in his voice and, well... you know when you HAVE to say, 'Have a nice day' to somebody because if you don't you'll tell them to go *F* themselves but you still have that tone and inflection in you voice and demeanor: well that's what he did.
Is it too much to ask for a sales person to be up-front and honest? If he would have told me about the issue, we could of just waited for the 2012 to arrive, I could see if I like it, then we could move from there: see, no problems. But to knowingly withhold information regarding the availability of the specific vehicle is just bad form. And if he or the dealership didn't know about not being able to order the 2011 model: they should have. They are a Ford car dealership full of salespersons whose job is to know all about their products and their procedures. So which side should I believe: doubtfully ignorant about the core business or slightly sneaking salesperson? ",3

She offered suggestions but did not force or persuade in any particular direction;the decision was ultimately ours. Shaunna took us out to the lot to take a look at the vehicles we were interested in. She was very patient and had an in-depth knowledge of the SUVs were looking at ( Titanium Escape and 2017 MKC 2.0). Any questions we had were answered politely and thoroughly. She even took the time out to look for a vehicle that would satisfy our aesthetic tastes. When we went to go finalize the lease and pick up the MKC, she was prepared with all the documentation and explained the nature of each document. When we were about to leave with the MKC, she took the time to explain all the features of the car and made sure we were comfortable with our choice.

Although my only regret is not going over my paper work more thoroughly as I spent over two weeks trying to get my registration for my car in time before expiration.  I was on the phone with them on several ocassions.  They claimed to have had problems with my insurance card but that wasn't a problem until 2 weeks before expiration when I initiated the call.  I then find out that after it had expired and they provided another temporary that I had never paid for my registration so they didn't put it in the mail like they claimed to have done.  If you make a call get the person's name and position and keep notes because they claim to have called you when they actually didn't.

Joby was a nice guy to deal with and got my ""no nonsense"" approach. I told him that I walked out of two other dealerships after their ""best"" price was not as good as other places. I let him know before that I won't renegotiate. Needless to say the price worked and I purchased the car. Everything else went fairly smooth. The key is knowing what the ""fair"" price is.

2733,13-Nov-10,"I think my experience with Dana Ford got better as time went on. When I first arrived no one came over to see if I needed help. After I was finally able to take a test drive, which I must say - Ford was the only dealership that allowed me to take a long test drive - I waited for 20 minutes for someone to come back and talk to me. It was when I was getting ready to leave that someone approached me for my feedback.  I think it was when they saw I was serious about purchasing a vehicle that they became serious as well.  On a very positive note, ultimately, we skipped through most of the negotiation game.  Ford started with a fair price, and when I told them the lower price of another vehicle I was considering, they matched it, which led me to sign papers and leave a deposit that night.  It only took two days for me to pick up the car.  Even though I arrived early for my appointment, the finance person was able to see me almost immediately, and I received the car in good condition. Anthony spent a long time sitting in the car with me showing me all of the features the car had, and set up my phone to sync with the car.  I appreciate the time he spent answering my questions. When I left the dealership, both the manager, Joe, and Anthony made it a point to tell me to come back or call if I had any questions whatsoever. All in all, once we were past the initial half hour, I received quality service, and will definitely not feel like I am being bothersome if I need to return.",4

I became concerned that I was going to have ongoing problems.  I called my salesman Ron Gori, and he returned my call after hours, made arrangements for me to bring my truck in, even came in early on the day I was arriving so that he could be there to personally take the truck into service.  He told me what he thought the problem was, and that it should be handled pretty quickly. He was right on both counts, and there were no more leaks and it didn't cost me anything.  Many salesman disappear after they make the sale and move on to the next one.  I am happy that Ron cared enough to help me deal with this problem, that's what really good salesman do.

1977,20-Dec-14,"Our salesperson Mary was diligent and stayed behind even after running behind for a concert  she had tickets for, to assist us with our new vehicle. I left my house alarm in our old car we traded in and she was kind enough to mail it out to me. 

She was diligent and thorough. We recommend her for her professionalism and commitment. 

Mary was the best part of our deal. The only drawback to the entire purchase was finding out after that we could've gotten the vehicle for much less probably. This really had nothing to do with Mary, but probably with the higher ups. 

We keep seeing offers on television for our same vehicle for much less a month with a much smaller down payment than we put down. 

Kudos to Mary and  I would consider her an asset. Just wish we would've shopped around for better rate than what we got. 

Best and Happy Holidays.

2334,29-Mar-13,"It's been a while since my husband and I have shopped for a car and my memories of car salesmen were different than our experience.  There was no high pressure at all - which, was a little weird to me actually.  It almost seemed like nobody cared if we bought a car or not.  It was up to us to decide - nobody made us any promises or sketchy deals.  We knew the car we wanted and needed to come to terms with the deal on the table; which we did.  Once we decided to go for it, the process was seamless.  By far, our best experience was with Steve the finance manager - he was great - friendly, not too pushy, didn't come off as being a fake or shady in the least and moved the transaction expeditiously.  Rich, the salesman was very nice as well, although, he really didn't sell us the car- we knew what we wanted, he did give a great recommendation for a place to have dinner and was very respectful.  Juan the manager was nice enough, although, he wasn't interested in wheeling and dealing with our trade in at all, which was a little disappointing, but in the end, it was fine.  Overall, our opinion of the dealership is good - I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to avoid Dana Ford if I was looking for a Ford vehicle - it's definitely not fancy, but supposedly it will be when the new building is finished in a couple of months.  If I was going to make any recommendations at all, it would be that ALL the sales people need to brush up on their knowledge of what they are selling.  It's 2013 - cars are high tech, and the folks that sell them need to understand what they are selling...  ",4.3

Went with Fusion, nice bells/whistles, rated well, and 0% up to 5 yrs.  Also considered Honda Accord-EX, but must buy ""Leather"" package to get some features standard on Fusion.  Worked with Luigi - very nice to work with, knowledgable, not high-pressure (and I am not a relative or friend of anyone at Dana), though very tough to reach by phone.  With taxes/title/etc and extended warranty (6yrs or 75K miles) came out to just over 29K, but I still consider that pretty good.  Synced my Blackberry phone to car no problem.

Shawn was awesome and patiently and efficiently worked with me over the phone for six weeks leading up to our travels to the East Coast where we agreed I would pick up the truck. He kept me apprised of the details of our deal, including going to query the titling & registration department three times about Colorado processing, answered every other question with professional and timely follow up, and treated me respectfully, which is how a client should be treated by a business.  (Shawn, I really wish I could have found a bottle of White Hennessy whiskey as a thank you but it just didn't reveal itself, not even when we passed through Tennessee. Sorry dude.)

Shawn also made arrangements for me to speak with Frank Curry about the Ford Pass system, he worked with the Service Department to ensure a truck bed-liner was installed and that the vehicle was made road-ready for my arrival, and he worked with his counterpart Frank Tripoli, the sales contract guy, to ensure my paperwork was accurate and ready when I arrived.  Both Franks were courteous, knowledgeable and efficient.  And, thanks to Shawn's efforts and the efforts of his colleagues, I was at the dealership for about an hour and then I was out the door with an activated Ford Pass--missing the commuter traffic on the NJTP.

I would give Dana Ford Lincoln of Staten Island a FIVE STAR rating based on the professionalism of their Sales staff, but the titling & registration department turned out to be a BIG LOSER in their client handling.  During the six week period that I worked with Shawn, there was discussion of the Dana team processing the titling, registration, and tax payment as part of the deal. The sales deal had a $75 fee included for 'Dealers optional fee for process application for registration and/or certificate of title' so I figured okay they have to fill out some forms for the State of Colorado for our purchase so I could accept a fee for this oddball effort on their part.  It's true that they supported Shawn with the questions he posed on my behalf , but two days before my vehicle pickup, after the deal was paid (with sales tax for the State of Colorado included), Shawn calls me to tell me that the titling & registration department wants an additional $225 to process the paperwork.  Losers!!  Is that bait and switch on their part or what!!!  Dana Ford Lincoln titling & registration team:  If you want this type of fee for processing, hello, you should have added to the deal during one of the THREE TIMES Shawn came to speak with you about it.  

On the after processing, the survey person kept calling my number and asking for my husband, and then couldn't find our record under my name when we finally connected.  Oh well, just a survey, no big.  But the finance lady who processed back the sales tax check was polite, fast in processing back the sales tax collected, and responsive to my request to direct the refund check to a different address being that we were on the East Coast for 3 weeks.  That was true customer service!

So i brought it to Dana and told them my tale of woe. Jeff one of the service managers who I have dealt with before  told me he would have the mechanic look at the car. Jeff was most helpful each time i had a problem.Well my car is working right now  as they found the problem. Moral to the Story is that i should have gone to the Dealer the first time.

I found the expedition on line myself and went over to look at it. The truck is beautiful so I decided to buy it. My salesman Anthony knew everything about the truck and was just as excited as was about it. 
I would have like to get a little better deal on the truck price wise and after talking to the manager of used cars I was not happy about his handling of the situation. His 200.00 deduction was a little insulting as I know he could have done a little better than that. If it wasn't for Anthony's professionalism and personality I would have gone to another dealer to shop and could have done that easily because I did not have to take out any loans.

He was honest about the prices and what we were getting for the money. I recommend the dealership because of him and all the other hardworking, helpful and polite employees. However,Dana ford needs to hire a new GM. While we were there Doug Hansen cursed out and basically fired our salesman while we were in the finance office. Apparently because plates weren't ready. Whatever the reason it was highly unprofessional and degrading. My children were with us and had to hear obscene language being shouted across the showroom. We left that night without buying the car. After calls from Joe B assuring us that Mike was asked to come back and they would take care of everything quickly and easily we decided to return. Had it not been for the deposit we may have lost I don't think we would have returned. In the end my overall rating was good because of the employees that were so helpful and courteous, but a GM is a must for this dealership, one who knows how to treat their employees with dignity and respect.

I recommend dealing with Joe and Shaunna as they were very helpful the second time around; they treated me in a way that should be given to every customer that steps in the door. The price was competitive even though it wasn't as low as I had wished it to be but in the end I was almost fully satisfied.

They are not their to sell, because it just happens naturally by their competence, appreciation and respect.  

Rich and I had been in touch for a few weeks until I was ready to buy.  He drove me around the lot until I found the exact config I was looking for.

If we feel like we are being taken advantage of or being hounded, we will take our business elsewhere. This was not the case AT ALL with Dana Ford. We went inside and were set up with Attique Khan. He got keys 2 two vehicles we were interested in and let us look at them side by side and test drive both. He was very knowledgeable and friendly. It wasn't until after we test drove both that he began asking about our thoughts and interest in purchasing. We decided on one and went inside. They negotiated a price we were comfortable with and gave us a great deal on a remote start which they installed the very next day. Anthony the sales manager was also very friendly and professional. They got us a great financing rate and everything was handled quickly and with ease. Attique took the time to introduce us to the Sync/MyTouch and set both of our phones up. We told Anthony and Attique that this was by far the most pleasant experience we have ever had! We look forward to continuing to do business with them in the future for service and sales.",4.8

  I was looking for a car and very particular model and price range as well as low mileage Brieann of Dana Ford was the first person to respond to my e mail , and was I lucky she did.  The experience was great.  I have a lot of friends who are always looking for a good deal or a ""retirement car"".  I have already shared with a few folks the experience I had as well as Brieann's contact information and the fact she is not the usual ""car sales"" person.  I found Brieann to be very informative and available but not pushy or bothersome.  She worked hard to get me information in a timely manner and stay in touch at the perfect contact level.  There is nothing worse than being inundated with calls and such when you are looking to buy anything...  You would be surprised how many folks are looking for a retirement car, one that will be reliable (A CPO) well priced and not a hassle to purchase.  Brieann and by extension Dana Ford shop seems to fit all of that.   Having purchased 20+ new Fords/Lincolns in the last 45 years I know about the experience of buying a car.  Brieann was one of the most pleasing experiences you can have when buying a car.  Gary.",4.8

The salesman was patient and knowledgeable and addressed all my concerns helping me to decide on  a vehicle that suited my needs and that I thoroughly enjoy.  His tutorial explaining the vehicle's new features was most helpful.  The dealership worked with me concerning pricing and I would recommend them to anyone interested in a new car.,4.8
2208,13-Apr-14,"This is a great dealership to buy from. Nearly all of my family's cars have been purchased from this place. The Customer Service is great and the staff is very friendly. Most of them will go out of their way to help you in any way possible whether you're buying, selling, or simply getting a car serviced. Any work on vehicles is done very well and appears to be conducted professionally and skillfully. The poor current state of the building itself however as well as all of the mud, sand, and dust in the back lot clearly impacts the cars negatively. I am assuming that this will no longer be a problem soon however, as the lots are being paved and a beautiful new building/facility is being constructed (and is pretty much completed). Prices are very good and are often negotiable, and I have never seen a sticker price that has been unfair yet. My most recent purchase was a few days ago when I purchased a 2013 Ford Mustang. The car was in perfect (nearly mint) condition and the price was a steal. My main salesperson was Anthony G, really nice guy and a well known and regarded expert on Mustangs. Would highly recommend him to anyone buying a Mustang (or any other car for that matter, he definitely knows what he is talking about unlike some dealers). I also spoke to Joe Frank when finalizing the deal and I would highly recommend him as well. My overall experience here was and has always been great.",4.8

He found the exact car I was looking for, Exterior color, with the Interior color  and the package I wanted, only issue, it was in Staten Island and we live out in Eastern Long Island. My husband placed a call and spoke with a gentlemen by the name of Glenn. He explained to Glenn the bad experience we had just had and how fed up I was with Lincoln, he told Glenn what we were looking for and Glenn offered to give us the same deal we were going to have at the other dealership, he put us in contact with John Daly the salesmen. We drove to Staten Island met with John Daly, we then spoke with Steven Riccardone in finance who made the experience as painless as possible. The whole experience at Dana was great. Everyone was such a pleasure to deal with. We would highly recommend using them. They really seem to care about making the customer happy and truly seem to be customer centered!",4.8

We were impressed with Dana Ford because of their selection, prices, and the ability to link to an auto check report for free.  Once we got to the dealership, we were treated with friendliness and professionalism.  The car we had picked out online was everything we expected.  The internet price didn't have as much negotiable room as we hoped, but we were pleased that there weren't lots of add-on fees.  We were also pleased to learn about all the warranties that are standard with a certified pre-owned Ford. We agreed on a price and were told to arrange insurance (it was Sunday) and payment (ours was a cash deal) and come back.  When we called to say we wanted to come back Monday instead of Tuesday, Anthony went out of his way to make sure our car would be ready. He drove to pick up in-transit plates (since they were out of them) and arranged with other people to detail our car in time.  We couldn't have asked for better service.  We are confident that we will enjoy our car for a long time.",4.8

He introduced us to Rich Harley, one of their sales consultants, who was most gracious as well as helpful. He showed us various vehicles and explained which extras came with each vehicle.  After choosing the car, Rich Harley sat with us and went over some details.  We then dealt with Joe Bogigian relative to, down payment, lease payments etc.  Everything went very smoothly and quickly and at all times Joe Bogigian took care of us.  We then sat with Nouri Aklouf, who took care of the financial transactions etc. He fully explained the various programs dealing with our current lease as well as going over each document my husband had to sign.  Again this part of our dealings went smoothly and quickly and then Rich Harley took us to our new car.  He showed us the ins and outs of our car and took his time answering our questions.

I have given this rating because as far as I am concerned the people my husband and I have dealt with over the past 17 years are most helpful, friendly, knowledgeable and this includes their service department as well.

2364,24-Jan-13,"I had a great expierence! It started as soon as I walked in to the dealership. No
pressure, just a friendly salesman (Tom Hansen) with an answer to every question. Never tying to push the sale of the car. I was actively looking around for the best car with the best price, so I was back and forth 3 times and Tom was just as friendly,patient and informative the 2nd and 3rd time back. Once I knew the Ford Explorer was the best car for me, I sat down with Tom and the sales manager Joe Bogigian. There was no long drawn out price discussion. I explained what lease agreement I was looking for and could afford and Joe was more then willing to work with me. Great overall expierence!! Would absolutely reccomend Dana.

2371,19-Jan-13,"Sales manager Joe Bogigian was simply outstanding. By far, he was the best salesman I have ever had the opportunity to work with. Always positive...had a can-do attitude about getting me the exact car I wanted and delivered on all of his promises.

I also worked with Tom Hansen who was a sales associate and he was also very pleasant to work with. Very nice guy and showed me every feature on my new car and instructed me on how to use them. Terrific.

I live on Long Island so Staten Island is not exactly conveniently located for me, but after how I was treated by Joe and Tom, I will DEFINITELY be going back to Dana for my next car!

Joe B. deserves a RAISE...terrific guy to do business with!!",4.8

2432,16-Oct-12,"My wife and I found Dana after ""giving up"" trying to (again) lease a  vehicle from another auto company (NOT Ford/Lincoln).
 
Dana provided THE BEST dealer experience we ever had!!

We would like to compare our Dana experience vs our other dealer experiences.

At  dealer # 1, we spent a long time test driving different vehicles. When it came time for pricing, We were given a figure by the manager and told that they ""could do better"" but the ""general manager"" wasn't there. We were promised with a handshake that we would receive a call with a better price the next day. Of course there were calls over several days but no price quotes. Annoying, aggressive calls but no prices. Getting a price quote should not be a national secret!

                             THE DANA WAY
We worked with Richard Harley. He was extremely knowledgeable, patient, polite and totally professional. When it came time for price quotes, we were given a price that they ""would like to get for this vehicle"" as a basis for negotiations. Richard told my wife and I to take time to discuss this, and to take as much time as we needed. Negotiations went back and forth in a respectful and courteous manner. Nobody standing over your shoulder and no need to wait for a ""mystery general manager"" here. 


At (non Ford/Lincoln)dealer #2 we were given a price and again were told that they could do better and that I would get a call in a few days. When they called back the sales rep told me that he ""just remembered"" that there was a returning leasee loyalty  certificate of $1000 available. He said that he could use this to reduce the price. He of course did nothing to ""work"" on his original price quote. That was like telling me that the price would be lower if I increased MY down payment. The loyalty certificate information should have presented to me immediately.


                              The Dana Way

When Richard Harley gave me his first quote he immediately said that it included all rebates and told me the details: A Ford rebate AND a competitors lease rebate. Everything at Dana was like that. They are honest, they care about their customers, and genuinely want you to be 100% satisfied.

My wife and I leased a beautiful Lincoln MKZ through Richard. Before we left the showroom with the vehicle Richard Harley and Frank Curry sat with us in the car for at least 40 minutes going over the numerous high tech features in the vehicle. There was no pressure by them to speed things up to get back to the showroom.

Everyone went out of their way to be sure that we were 100% satisfied. Sales manager Juan Estrella spoke with us many times throughout the process to make sure things were ok. At Dana you never feel extreme pressure to buy. They truly want you to take your time without relentless pressure. The total experience is positive. Even Steve Riccardone in finance (the guy you have to pay!!) made that part of the deal painless. Again no pressure to purchase anything that you may not want/need.

The care and concern for customers at Dana does not end when you leave the showroom.
In the 2 weeks since leasing our MKZ, Richard has called several time to see if everything is ok, and a representative from the office also has called to ask about our experience with Dana.


So my wife and I HIGHLY recommend doing business at Dana. I cannot think of anything negative to say about them.

Our team of Richard Harley, Juan Estrella, Frank Curry, and Steve Riccardone were top of the line. I am confident that ANY TEAM at Dana will be just as wonderful.

Finally, the other dealers that I visited would benefit by sending their sales people to Dana posing as customers to see how business should be conducted.

2452,13-Sep-12,"Dana Ford is the best, they treated me like family. I went in to test drive the Escape and Dion White was so nice and answered all my questions, the deal wasnt made that day but I couldnt get over the way He had treated me. I went to several other dealerships on the Island and was not treated with the same respect and kindness so needless to say, I went back a week later. I was greeted and introduced to Mike Passaro, not once did he make me feel overwhelmed and he answered all my questions. he made it happen! along with Juan Estrella and Mitch Bass and lets not forget Joe Bogigian, what a team! you have a customer for life. thank you all :-) I am truly happy with my Candy Blue Ford FoCus. Jo ",4.8
2453,12-Sep-12,"Great sales experience.  The sales managers were experienced and honest about the vehicle and the deals. Very straight forward, no pressure sales.  One minor issue for me was that they didn't check the vehicle for safety recalls prior to me driving it off of the lot... but they rectified the situation quickly & efficiently.  Definately will return and recommend!",4.8
2463,06-Sep-12,"I found a 2009 Lincoln MKZ online and fell in love with the look and features of the car, plus it only had 23,000 miles on it. I live in central NJ and decided to make the drive to Staten Island to look at the car and test drive it. When I walked in, I was approached by Richard and I told him that I was interested in the car if I could get it for the right price. The car was listed at $25,000 at the dealership and $24,000 online. I offered them $21,500 for the car and was countered with the old &quot;someone offered $22,300 a week ago and was turned down&quot;. (I understand they have to do their job and try to make money so I wasn't concerned with the price games they attempted to play). I countered with $22,000 as my final offer and it was accepted. We took it for a test drive and Rich showed me the features. I fell in love with the car and decided to proceed with the paperwork. I was approved for a phenomenal 1.9% interest rate over 5 years which excited me even more. The process didn't take long at all and I went into Steve's office to finish the paperwork. He was thorough and corrected 2 mistakes that ended up saving me over $1,000 (The interest rate was at 2.9% instead of 1.9% and the sales tax was for NY's almost 9% instead of NJ's 7% tax). I went to look at the car on a Sunday and was disappointed to find out that I couldn't take the car home because my insurance company was closed and would also be closed Monday for Labor Day. Seeing my disappointment, Joe told me that he would give me a dealer plate that I could use until Tuesday when my insurance company would be open! I was thrilled and it topped off an already very pleasant experience at Dana Motors. When I was handed the keys, I was in a bit of a rush to beat the storm, but Joe was very nice and offered to show me anything I wanted to know about the cars features. When I came back on Tuesday, Frank took his time to go over all of the features of the navigation and sync system that I was trying to figure out on my own, but was having a little bit of difficulty. He didn't rush through the tutorial or anything so I was very pleased. While waiting around, I saw Joe again and he was a nice kid to have a conversation with. He passed the time and was very knowledgeable about the cars being sold there. NOW, I can only vouch for the people I worked with at this dealership. Some of the younger salesmen there didn't create a very pleasant atmosphere because of their &quot;grouping&quot; and hawking people as they came through the door. So all I can recommend is starting your visit off by dealing with Richard Harley, because I don't know if I would have purchased this car if I dealt with someone else. Thanks Rich!!!!",4.8
2519,03-Mar-12,"**NOTE: I started a review and was almost finished when I must have hit the wrong key, and lost what I'd started (I may have inadvertentley sent it). This is the complete evaluation.

On 3/3/12, my wife and I visited the Dana Ford/Lincoln showroom to look one particular Certified Used car they'd advertised online; our reason was to replace an existing vehicle we owned. We did not have definite plans to purchase any vehicle today, but were interested in one particular car.

In no small fashion, for the reasons set forth below we did make the purchase today.

The moment we entered the showroom, we were greeted in a friendly manner. Steve Keely, the salesperson we dealt with, seemed and was genuinely interested in assisting us and making the experience pleasant -- and above all never employed any ""high pressure"" tactics. He was polite, attentive, and knowledgeable the entire time.

 I apologize for not remembering their names, but the Sales and Finance Managers who assisted us were also worthy of mention for their assistance and interest in processing our purchase. Indeed, all the dealership employees we came into contact with were friendly.",4.8

$540.00 and walk out paying $575.00 I don't like changes. If I am quoted $540. It should be honored.",4.8
2595,18-Sep-11,"Lauren in the service dept. was very friendly, accommodating and did not keep me waiting while on the phone or in person. She is very professional &amp; an asset to the company.
Jackie was also friendly, accommodating and tried to be a liaison between the service dept. and myself as I was extremely unhappy with them.
My sales experience was amazing!
Both Tony Donato and Mike Price were extremely professional and patient with me and all my questions. This Dealership hit the jackpot hiring both men. Tony is a Stand-up man of his word. He has a positive persona and listens to you as he looks at you straight in the eye. Many other Sales Managers would be planning their  next strategy to close the deal.
Mike Price listened to my concerns and needs and was very helpful. Mike Price is a  car enthusiast and is more knowledgeable than most men twice his age. Do not let his age or youthful appearance fool you. He is great at his job and at the top of his game. Fact is he doesn't play games and that is more important to me than anything else including a great price. He also went above and beyond with helping me learn how to use Mytouch & Sync features and offered future assistance.  They both worked with me until I was satisfied with the outcome of our arrangement and they made it happen as quickly and painlessly as possible. It was my best experience yet leasing or purchasing a vehicle. I recommend both men highly!
Kudos To Douglas Hansen for a job well done.

As for Eddie Sharp, he too was very helpful in setting up our personal setting to the new car and made sure we understood how everything worked in our new car. Also was very detailed with his description of the features we had and made us feel comfortable to call him with any questions we may have in the future (usually once you sign the papers on a new car then nobody wants to know your name).

Juan Estrella the sales manager was also great and pleasant to deal with, so a big shout out to him as well. I would also like to mention John in finance. Dealing with John was also very easy and pleasant.

29,30-Jan-20,"I was in the market for a new lease and I went into Dana Ford because I had used them in the past and always left with a positive experience.

Worked with Mary and Claudia in sales and both were excellent.  They answered all the questions I had, found me the car I was looking for and did not rush me through the leasing process, which put me at ease because I always hate having to get a new car... its this reason why I keep coming back to Dana Ford.

On the finance side of things I worked with Steve who did all my paperwork and got the lease payments setup and processed and then I worked with Shawn who walked me through financing and transferring my plates and everything else that needed to be done before I could get the new car.  Again, both employees were great and they answered all my questions and made me feel comfortable with my choices.

The entire process only took a few hours and I was in and out with a new vehicle.  If you are currently in the market for a new car, or will be soon, definitely consider going to Dana Ford as they really will work with you to try and get you the best deal out there... ",5

187,11-Jul-19,"I have been buying and leasing cars for over 20 years and I must say this was the easiest transaction so far. My salesman nick squeo was extremely knowledgeable about the ford expedtion I leased. He took his time to go over all the mechanical, Saftey and technology options. Unlike other salesman I’ve dealt with he also didn’t try to pressure me into the purchase. After the test drive I sat with sales manager Steve riccardone. With very little negotiating we came to an agreement the same day and I could tell he was giving me the best deal he could. Usually sales managers give you the run around and I wind up leaving and getting a call back days later. At that point the deal is over for me. He beat another ford dealers price by $50 a month which was amazing. The next day I came in, signed my papers and was in my new truck within a half hour, which was a first for me. Finance guy was great also, unfortunately I do not remember his name. I was very pleased with the service I received from walking in the door being offered water or coffee by the secretary, to walking out with my new expedition. I would recommend this dealership if you are looking for a ford or Lincoln ",5

Upon going in to trade in my Fiat, I received over market value for the Fiat, and I was able to use that as portion of my deposit. Steve, had the Salesman Nick Squeo take care of me, Nick was so kind to take detailed pics of two vehicles to send them too me for my wife to see, as she is was working and we live in Brooklyn, we quickly decided on the color and I went in to see Nick and Steve. The negotiation process went seamless, both Steve the mgr and Nick sat down with me and we hashed out the deal over a cup of coffee. The whole dealership has a complete and quality vibe to it, was greeted and over refreshments by many many employees. The deal was made, upon completed the numbers I sat down with John Davy in finale, quick easy, not BS. Sign sealed and delivered, there was no pushing or pressure at all to purchase additional warranty, we did decide to purchase the additional coverage.

205,30-May-19,We got the truck we wanted at a good price. The whole process was made easy because of Leonard Cami.  Most car salesmen push so much you just want to leave the dealership but not Cami. He thoroughly explained everything and we had no surprises.  ,5
207,27-May-19,"So when I booked my appointment it was with Tiffanie Sabater., we didn't know when we showed up she was the actual sales man.Told my wife this isn't going to work.

We hated the process, then here's Tiffanie she changed the way I think of ford now. She was fantastic she was pleasant yet told me what I could get and not get. She was better than all the male salesman we ever had to deal with  at ford. This 2019 Explorer was the best experience we ever had. We had a deal we liked in the shortest time ever, I mean me and my wife loved our experience and it's because of Tiffanie Sabater, thanks ford for providing us with your best employee and see you again   in 2022 or sooner for our daughters car

After talking several times with Ron Gori (who was so helpful and responsive to our many, many questions), we drove up from Virginia to Staten Island just to look at a car. We never felt that he was just trying to sell us a car, but rather that he wanted us to be completely satisfied with whatever we decided. We bought the car. With the long drive home, Ron and Jimmy helped to make our wait time at the dealership as short and possible, by expediting each step. We’ve now had the car for 2 weeks and we’re completely satisfied with it, and with the follow-up paperwork services from the dealership.  We’d drive 400 miles again for their quality services. ",5

Anthony Rivera, was professional, patient and even took my calls on his day off, he paid attention to my every request. Paul Aguilar was intelligent, funny, informative and gave me options.  At the eleventh hour, Paul  made the deal happen, when my out of state financing resource was not ready to handle things.  Less then a week from when I made my first email request, I was taken care of, and I had the car of my dreams!  Jimmy Rosario, didn't hesitate to step in and keep things moving along. I had gone to 2 other Ford dealerships within 10 miles of my home and either no one called me back or they were not listening to my requests.  So it was well worth it to make a trip to Staten Island. My Ford Escape is awesome, it is used, but to me she is beautiful, not a scratch, it still has that new car smell!  Dana Motor's should be the business model that industry uses.  Their ""no haggle price"" is highly competitive.  They even filled the car with full tank of gas and Anthony offered to ""sync""my phone with the car!!   Awesome Service and I would buy from them again!!",5

284,12-Mar-19,"I was in the market for a new car and so I visited Dana Ford Lincoln to look into a new Ford Edge.  When I entered into the shop I was greeted by a lovely receptionist who after asking me what I was there for paired me up with Mary Graffeo and then off we went to look at the selection of cars they have at their property.

Let me first off say that Mary was great!  She was not at all pressuring me into a car that I did not want and she asked me a bunch of questions about what I was looking for and what features I wanted and what my budget was and then based on that she took me around the lot to look at cars that matched my criteria.  She let me look at each car for a bit, she did not rush me and any question I had about the model I was looking at she answered with great detail.  After looking around for a bit, I finally settled on a new 2019 Edge.  It had everything I was looking for and so we went back into the dealership and started up the paperwork.  Mary was great during this step of the process as well, she answered any financial questions I had and she worked with me as best she could to help get me a better price on my lease.  After a couple of hours all the paperwork was done and I was the proud owner of a new Edge.

If you happen to read this and you are looking at possibly picking up an Edge, head over to Dana Ford and ask for Mary.  She really did help make this experience as painless as possible and it was that courtesy that sold me on the Edge.  Thanks Again Mary!  You were great!  ",5

This most recent experience was actually a learning experience for me personally. With pre-owned vehicles, the pricing is now fixed at Dana so the customer does not have to haggle over the deal. Being a skeptic, I searched for a similar vehicle over a 100 mile radius with other Lincoln dealers. As I learned, Dana did actually offer the best possible price.

Because Auto Dealerships are closed on Sunday’s and I needed to satify my curiosity on the 2019 Nautilus, I contacted Dana Ford in Staten Island. Dana Ford assured me that they would find a way to earn my business so I skeptically took the drive across the Outerbridge. 

I cannot say enough about my experience. Upon arrival, I was immediately greated by Mr. Francesco Vendra. I explained to Mr. Vendra exactly what I needed (i.e., an MKC and a Nautilus), and he immediately brought me to the lot to pick out a Nautilus to test drive. Both before, during and after the test drive, and with out rushing, Mr. Vendra explained all of the features and technology that comes with the vehicle. Once done we went in to work out a deal, and after a little back and forth, we came to a final number “if I were to take the delivery right then and there.” I explained I needed to think about it and rather than pressuring me, I was informed the deal would still be good regardless should I chose to agree. The following day I called Mr. Vendra and informed him that we would be coming in to sign the deals. 

Upon our arrival, Mr. Vendra immediately greated my wife and I, and began the paperwork. The process from beginning to end was swift and painless and we drove home in our new cars quickly thereafter. 

I highly recommend Dana Lincoln and particulary Mr. Vendra. Mr. Vendra’s customer service, knowledge of the vehicles and overall professionalism is exceptional and beyond reproach. Please be sure to ask for Mr. Vendra when visiting Dana Ford-Lincoln. ",5

861,03-Sep-18,"I have been a customer of Dana Lincoln/Ford for several years. As my Lease was coming to a end on my Lincoln MKC I was looking at the Ford Explorer Platinum. I recall having conversations with salesperson Mary Graffeo in the past. So when I called Dana Ford and asked to speak to her. Once on the phone Mary G. recalled who I was. I then informed her that my lease was coming to an end and the vehicle that I was looking for.  From that moment Mary G. was great, she knew the vehicle I was gearing towards and located the vehicle. As I was not available to visit the showroom that same day, She set up an appointment with me for the following day.  Upon my arrival at Dana Ford I was greeted my Mary G. she had the vehicle ready for me to look at. I then had a problem with another person at Dana Ford who's name I'll keep to myself but safe to say that between Mary G. and Nick A.Abbrazzese the deal was completed and I am once again a satisfied Dana Customer. The bottom line if you want to have a salesperson who will treat you like the most important person and reach your goal with your next vehicle I truly suggest that you ask for Mary Graffeo and if there are and problems along the way ask for Nick Abbruzzese  and I'm sure he will address the issue and resolve it.

For the sales people at Dana, it's all about the buyer.

I was shown a few vehicles, but when I mentioned gas, the Energi was recommend. Only took the test drive to love it! I didn't have much time to shop b/c of my schedule, so I was happy with the Salesman being upfront about what my options were. I made sure to come with my paperwork and the process was very short. I've bought several vehicles, new and used from various dealerships. I have to say this was the easiest buying experience yet.

960,04-May-18,"I leased my new Lincoln MKC from Dana Lincoln in Staten Island and loved the experience. I went to Dana which is  1;30 minutes from my home in Long Island because Mary Graffeo our sales person at Dana took the time to find us the car we wanted and not sell me what they had on the lot as three of my local dealers wanted to do. In addition, Dana saved us over $80 a month when compared to my local dealers quotes on their stock items. In addition, when we went to pick up the car it was in a glass enclosed room with red carpet and our name on a sign in front  of our car. It was there that Mary spend 30 minutes reviewing all the option of our new car. She also set up our radio station and GPS to help us find our way back home. 
The entire experience of turning in our old lease and obtaining the new one took less then 50 minutes.  
Equally important, the amazing price Mary quoted me on the phone was the exact price I paid.

He was very knowledgeable and spent a lot of time with me answering all my questions and concerns. He found the car that completely met my needs at a price that I was most happy with. Most people don't look forward to the car buying experience but I have to say this was one of the best.

984,03-Apr-18,I recently had a three year lease come to an end with Dana Ford Lincoln. It truly crept up on me and I was caught off guard. I did research and found a ton of places that were just trying to get me through the door without clarifying the fine print. I returned to Dana Ford Lincoln wondering if they could help me as I was a fan of the Ford Fusion. Safe to say they did and I walked out the same day of my return with a brand new lease. 2018 Ford Fusion at a reasonable price. Happy to be with this dealership for three more years!,5

When I mentioned I was interested in purchasing another Ford, she hooked me up with Vincent Langilotti.  Vinny was wonderful.  He was not pushy and in no time (I think less than hour) I purchased a Escape.  Picked up the car today and I'm thrilled.  It has so many features I wasn't aware of and it rides and handles beautifully.  David Diorio in Finance was also excellent.

The sales person, Mr. Jonathan Taylor was extremely helpful, patient, and not at all pushy. Both myself and my wife drove three different cars, until the one we really liked. Even after we purchased the car, he took about one hour to show us how to use some advanced features of the car.
Mr David Diorio stepped in from time to time to authorize some deals, to take our requests, and to come with even better offers.
Mr. Jeffrey Beyer did the paper work, the financing, and everything involving payments and took our requests in a stride, accommodating them in a matter of minutes.

1073,28-Nov-17,"My name is Andre Zoga. A few weeks ago I went to DANA in desperate need of a new vehicle for my company needs as my old one was becoming unbearable and unreliable. I was greeted by a genial salesman named Edi. First I just want to say that he made me feel I could trust him and by extension DANA to give me a fair price. These days it seems like every business is trying to take advantage of you one way or another, not DANA. Edi listened to my automotive needs and assured me he would find the right fit, and that he did. I needed a lot of cargo space and he found me this beautiful ford transit that barely had any miles on it. Such an upgrade from my last van! It's sleek, powerful, and capable of holding large quantities of electrical equipment and materials. Not to mention it rides so smoothly. Edi is the kind of salesman that makes one feel like they picked the right establishment to go to.

Salesman Nick Squeo Toured me through the lot looking at all the models (I went with intentions of getting a Ford “Edge” but by the time I told him all the added options I wanted. He was honest and said “with everything you want to add on, go with the Lincoln because those options are all standard equipment and it will be cheaper” needless to say, I left with the Lincoln “MKC Select” and it has more bells and whistles than the Edge that I had my heart set on AT A BETTER PRICE!! And I have to give Kudos to Juan Estrella, David Diurio and Frank Tripoldi. They were so hospitable and a pleasure to deal with. I’ve never had a purchase/lease on a vehicle go so smoothly. No haggling, no price changing, NO GAMES! I am gonna tell anyone that I know that’s looking into buying a new car to get their butt to Dana!

Each department worked seamlessly with my husband to insure that we were offered the best possible deal for our new lease, and handled our the insurance change over as well as  the return of my old leased vehicle.  These three staff members in particular helped us so much in our decision making process!  You could find the best deal and best car, on the market, but if the staff you are dealing with are subpar it makes the whole happy buying experience a real letdown.  Particularly, management team member Steve Riccardone kept us laughing the entire time, and was even able to convince my husband that my desire to purchase the extended length navigator was a great idea!  We have had our vehicle for about a week now, and my husband and I could not be happier with our decision and the service we received from Dana Ford!  ",5

It goes without saying that I love the look and quality of the Ford trucks,that's a given. However, I always come back only to Dana for one main,overriding reason and that is Juan Estrella. He has handled every single transaction of mine,for all of those years. He has earned my trust,respect and loyalty. My wife drives a Lincoln truck and my son a Ford sedan. Juan handled those sales as well. There have been very,very few issues through the years,but Juan was always there to handle things,sales related or not. On this deal he was ably assisted by an intelligent,courteous salesman,Shawn Ortiz. He got me signed,sealed and delivered in record time,much appreciated.
My bottom line is this: as long as Juan is at Dana Ford Lincoln,my family and myself will continue to be customers.

My team of assistance was Chris Panelli, Steve Ricccardone, Matt Riccardone and John Hart who were all very knowledgeable, patient and courteous.

1283,07-Oct-16,"I have nothing but great things to say about the crew that helped me get my car. Jonathan Taylor, aka the ""Car Jesus"", was my Savior. He came into my family's deli the day I was going to make a deal at another dealership on a different car. When I went to check him out after he received his food, I noticed his vest said ""Dana"". It was like he fell from the heavens to help me find the car I was searching for after being so bummed on the deal I was going to make that same day. I explained my situation and he told me he could help me with exactly I was looking for in the price range I was able to pay. He gave me his card and probably thought I wasn't serious when I said I would.see him after work. My shift ended and I called Jonathan, telling him I was coming in that night to see him. When I got to the dealership, Jonathan showed me so many cars that fit my likes, needs and budget. It was really amazing. He was so educated and had a correct answer for every question I had. Within a few minutes, we found my car with all of the things I wanted.

The night grew late so I went home to sleep on this huge financial change I was about to endure. Jonathan followed up with me the next day and with his crew and sales manager, Steve Riccardone (another great guy), they put the price right where I needed and told them I could pay right from the beginning. They worked the numbers to exactly what I could realistically afford.

Overall, Jonathan was in the perfect place at the perfect time (as was I) when I crossed paths with him on a normal work day. He took care of me from start to finish. Between himself, Jeff Beyer, Steve Riccardone and ALL of the other staff at Dana, I would HIGHLY recommend all of my friends, families and strangers to buy their car with these guys. Their kindness made me drive home a happy lady in my brand new car. What a crew they have at Dana.. it was my first experience with them and definitely NOT my last !! ",5
1284,05-Oct-16,"My experience at Dana Ford was a very positive experience.  I was very lucky to have Jonathan Taylor as my sales rep.  Jonathan took the time to answer all of my questions and concerns in regards to finding the right vehicle for my family and I.  When it came to discussing the financial aspect of the transaction, again, Jonathan and Dana Management spent the time with me to work out an agreement. 
Jonathan Taylor and Dana Management performed their services with true professionalism, they showed great knowledge of their product and services.  I am more than satisfied with overall experience and will more than likely  return there for future purchases / leases. 
I would refer Jonathan Taylor to anyone who is interested in purchasing / leasing  a vehicle.",5

Chuck was his usual,""all over the problem"" self,made sure we were taken care of quickly,and back on the road as soon as possible. What impresses my wife and I the most,however,was the fact that we've had the truck for 2 years. You would think that the early,""let's impress the new customer"" approach would have worn off by now.IT HAS NOT.Chuck is as attentive now as he was when we first purchased the vehicle.

Michael Passaro was finance manager i dealt with, truly a great person. 
i haggled with him to no end and he never got annoyed or bothered at all. Always had a smile on his face and i can get a little annoying when i haggle.   sometimes i push too much. He helped me to get to the price i could afford.  I would absolutely reccomend this dealership to everyone and would strongly reccomend dealing with salesman and manager that i dealt with.

We returned to Dana once we made our decision, met with Vincent and leased a 2016 Escape.  We had an Escape many years ago, bought an Explorer after that (had it for 8+ years) and traded it for our Escape this trip.  We are really loving our new Escape and learning all the new features.

1408,03-Feb-16,"Dana Ford has become my go to dealer for all my Ford service needs. I have had nothing but satisfying and positive results whenever I bring my vehicle in for service or repair. The staff is outstanding from the professionals who politely answer the phone and schedule appointments to everyone of the service advisors I have had the pleasure of dealing with. Yesterday I met Anthony, but on previous visits I have dealt with Joe, Charles and Jeff. They all have done an excellent job keeping me informed and updated on all repairs and needed service work. Kudos to all the mechanics and assorted service personnel as they have made expert one and done repairs every time. I have to thank Charles especially for enrolling me in the service rewards program. I highly recommend this program. Called just before noon yesterday to inquire if I could get an oil change, spoke to someone who said no problem even though I couldn't get there until 1pm. Once I got checked in, I went to the customer lounge and made a coffee. I did some work on my laptop and fired off a couple of emails in an hour. It was then I went to stretch my legs and get some air out front. Stepping outside I noticed an Explorer just like mine, same color, but much nicer, being parked out front. Wait.... it was mine, Thanks courtesy wash for erasing winter storm Jonah, it was crusted in salt when I brought it in. Now for the best part. I went to the service desk to pay and get my keys, Bonus I had a complimentary oil change coming via the rewards program. It does not get any better than that. You may not always be out in an hour as I was but the desired results of a well maintained and repaired vehicle has added up to all my travels in that Ford being trouble-free and Dana Ford Service is one of the top reasons for that.

Yes, my lease went through in about two hours.",5
1411,01-Feb-16,I purchased a Dodge from another dealership and it has been a headache from the beginning. For my next car I decided to stop at Dana Ford Lincoln.

I told him it wasn't necessary but he made sure that I was provided top quality service. I paid $10k less then my Dodge and the Ford is way way better.

Besides getting the best price on Ford and Lincoln vehicles from Bob Ingrassia Salesman and Juan the Ford Manager and Nick the Lincoln Manager ( i presently have 3 cars , 2 Lincoln's and a Ford ). Their service is by far the best , besides great service writers Chuck and Anthony in Lincoln and Artie in Ford you are always welcome and taken care of even without a appointment.

On Monday December 28th we were shopping in Wilkes Barre ,Pa, I left my wife at the mall and went to Coccia Lincoln for a oil change they told me they couldn't do it until Saturday January 2nd I said its a simple oil change , sorry we can't do it. The next day Tuesday December 29th we were shopping at the outlets in Tannersville again I left my wife Margaret and went to Ray Price Lincoln in Stroudsburg Pa. they told me they couldn't change the oil until the following Tuesday January 5th. again I said its only a oil change sorry we can't do it. Neither dealership saw my vehicle or asked where did I buy it.Today January 12th after work I went to Dana without a appointment at 4:45 pm I pulled into the service writing area , I saw Chuck and asked for a oil change and he said no problem,they rotated the tires washed my car and I was out of there at 5:35 Now thats service .

1439,04-Jan-16,"When I arrived at 1:30 for my 2:00 p.m. appointment a young man named Joe Petruccelli offered to assist me in finding the vehicle I had been researching for several weeks.  I wasn't sure if I wanted to lease or finance so Joe took me out to the lot via golf cart so I wouldn't have to walk too much,  and  he explained about the different vehicles, their sizes, equipment, model types.  I explained to him that money was a big factor for me so he was sure to show me vehicles within my price range.  I found a Fusion S model and we went for a test drive.  The ride is amazing.   When we got back my 2013 Cruz was appraised and we sat down and explored leasing versus financing.  Thomas, Mike, Steven and Joe were amazing as they did not rush me; they explained everything to me and gave me room to make my own decision.  They did not ""hard sell"" me and gave me the opportunity to figure out my best course of action.  I am now a first time lessee and have these gentlemen to thank.  And by the way, I had to return to the showroom today and Joe P.  set up my Sync system for my cell phone so I can talk through the car speakers.  Joe has gone above and beyond in being helpful and I am sure to recommend Dana Ford Motors to anyone interested in a car.  Thank you all!

1447,29-Dec-15,"I am a 70-year-old senior living on a modest income who needed to turn in a lease to an opposing dealership which had been pressuring me to re-lease (so annoying). It was what made me turn to Dana Ford in Staten Island.  I had an experience driving the Ford Escape while my car was being repaired a few years ago and from that moment on it won my heart and I made up my mind next time I leased it would be a Ford Escape.  That dream came true thanks to the amazing sales team at Dana Ford in Staten Island.  Justin Pica, Tom Caccese, Juan Estrella, Nori Artouf and Steve Riccardone made me feel like I was part of their family...they worked with me taking into consideration my income...they were patient and very kind beyond my expectations (I think Santa whispered in their ears) and yesterday I picked up my big girl Red Wagon...the Ford Escape Titanium and oh will I play with it. She is beautiful and so intelligent...I feel safe and secure knowing I have the best safety features available while I am out and about playing with her in the rain, sleet and snow (whenever it decides to show up this year)...in the meantime I can enjoy a great view of the sky thanks to my panoramic moonroof.  I could go on and on.  If you want the best experience purchasing or leasing a vehicle...go straight to Dana Ford...ask for Justin, Tom, Nori, Juan or Steve tell 'em this little old ""Italianbroad"" sent ya...you'll be greeted with a smile from the minute you walk in...and a huge hug when you leave...even though you will want to hang out with these guys all day long.  The experience you will have at Dana Ford will wipe away any prior negative car buying/leasing experience you may have encountered.  On your mark...get ready...just GO!!!",5

Bobby is such a caring awesome person who always treats me like family. I keep going back to Dana because of him. He is such a knowledgeable man I trust him with  all three cars I lease from Dana.

Thanks Anthony",5
1460,18-Dec-15,"Being someone who typical shops for premium SUV's, I was skeptical to look at the Ford Explorer.  However,  this year Ford released the 2016 Explorer Platinum edition, targeting the premium market.
I began speaking with Joby Joseph in June 2015 looking for the new Platinum edition, however this model was delayed until later in the year.  Joby and I would speak over the next few months, sometimes on calls, as well as his person cell/texts, providing updates of when I could expect to see the vehicle.

When it came time to actually make the purchase in fall 2015, Joby and Juan Estrella were great, helping me negotiate a great deal for the car, never letting me feel stressed or pressured during the process. They assisted with the lease return of my Infiniti SUV, and delivered the new car as soon as it began to be available at the dealership.

I am now converted to Ford and enjoy my new Explorer very much.  I recommend Dana to friends and tell them to look up Joby as soon as they arrive.

The Receptionist Valerie was friendly with a lovely personality - I told her I did not want to be pressured into anything she said no problem and introduced me to Mary - when I told her what I was looking for she took me over to the cars and said ""that car looks just right for you"".  She was right, the car is beautiful and drives like a dream.  I told her what I was looking to pay - she spoke to her boss Juan and got me a wonderful deal! She was patient, understanding and kind. She took the time to answer all of my questions and she cared enough to make sure I got exactly what I was looking for. 
If you are looking for a car go see Mary - she is THE BEST!! ",5

1549,09-Oct-15,My first experience (2 years ago) with Dana left me with a bad feeling about them. My car was 2 months old (purchased at another dealership) I was treated poorly by a young lady. This time it was a completely different experience. My engine light went on so I went to Dana. I had a doctor's appointment in Great Neck at 11:15 for a medical procedure which I could not cancel. Jamie Liga took care of my situation with professionalism and showed a sincere concern for my problem. Not only did he fix the engine light problem but he also had the recall taken care of at the same time. I was willing to return at another date for the recall..I was out of Dana by 10:10 and luckily for me there was light traffic and I was on time for my procedure.

1571,23-Sep-15,"My wife and I recently finalized our 3rd lease for a Lincoln MKZ at Dana. This is by far the best dealership we have ever visited. 
From the moment we entered the showroom we received ""top of the line"" treatment. You really can't compare Dana to any other dealership. Starting with the facility itself; it is spotless and customer friendly to the max. You are always warmly greeted and NEVER feel under siege or under pressure as with so many ""old school"" dealerships.
Starting with our salesman Richard Harley (our 3rd Lincoln Lease with him) the entire process was easy, and respectful. 

Richard is patient, extremely knowledgeable and was always available to us to help us make an informed decision with zero pressure. Sales manager Nick Abbruzzese helped us ""close the deal"" in a likewise respectful and extremely fair manner. Even at his level there was again zero pressure. Nick approved what I considered to be an extremely favorable offer and  honored his price quote on a 2016 Lincoln when the specific 2015 vehicle we wanted was not available. A first class operation!! 
 The finance business was also easy and competently handled by  finance director Nouri Aktouf. In keeping with the Dana style of doing business he was thorough, respectful, and took enough time to answer ALL of our questions. Finally, Frank Curry the Dana Customer relations manager took as much time  as we needed (along with Richard Harley) to bring us up to date with all of the new technological features in our MKZ. Frank made it clear that he is always available if questions arise. And although Juan Estrella was not directly involved in the process with us this time, he remembered us, greeted us warmly, and made it clear that he was available to us if necessary.

One last thing that separates Dana from other dealers is the ONGOING calls/emails that we received from Richard Harley and others at Dana. These are calls/emails that we received from time to time throughout the course of our lease to see how we are making out with our vehicle and to see if there are any problems/concerns. These are NOT calls that arrive just before the lease expires  hoping for a sale, but are calls of genuine concern even though the lease may have years to go before renewal. Customer relations at it's best!

Although not a factor in the lease process, I should add that in keeping with the Dana standards,  our experience with the service department over the years has  also been ""top of the line"". The high quality of our Lincoln vehicles has greatly limited our need for service calls!  



A quick word about our 2nd MKZ lease:

ON OCTOBER 29, 2012 OUR MKZ WAS DESTROYED DURING HURRICANE SANDY. THE WATER LINE INSIDE THE VEHICLE REACHED TO THE TOP OF THE STEERING WHEEL!
There was never any question that my wife and I would return to Dana if and when the insurance adjuster would declare our vehicle a total loss.

As for Lincoln Roadside Assist: When it was all but impossible to get a tow truck to move storm damaged vehicles, Lincoln Roadside Assist was able to get a truck out to us on November 2nd, THE SAME DAY WE CALLED!! 

When we arrived at Dana all of the staff we had worked with before offered their support and were genuinely concerned about us and our family. Fortunately there was still inventory to choose from and we were behind the wheel of a new MKZ within days. And in keeping with the Dana style of ""going the extra mile"" for customers, Richard Harley drove my wife and I home to Brooklyn in his personal vehicle when no other vehicles or cabs were available in the aftermath of the hurricane. A 1st rate dealership all the way!



What I mentioned in Dealer Rater 3 years ago (10/16/2012) is as true now as it was then. ""Other dealerships would benefit from sending their sales staff to Dana pretending to be customers to learn how  business should be conducted.""

1572,22-Sep-15,"We don't live close by but went there to look at a pre-owned Lincoln SUV.  They had the best price around.  We were introduced to Gennaro who was really nice and not pushy.  He worked with us and showed us the best available cars.  The SUV he showed us was very clean and had low mileage.  Everybody we met while we were walking around were really nice and greeted us and asked us if we needed help.  Once we chose the car, Gennaro was running around getting the paperwork done while we were watching TV and eating the pastries.  Sal in finance also treated us professionally and answered all our questions.  We had to come back for our inspection because the machine was not working properly due to a glitch in the computer system run by NYS DMV.  When we came back, Anthony in the service department greeted us and had the work done right away.  This dealership is a great dealership and we would wholeheartedly recommend it to anybody looking for a Ford or Lincoln.  Ask for Gennaro.",5
1573,22-Sep-15,"Good explanation, not a long waitt, the coffee is nice,everythingis new and clean, its nice to get a ride home and back .   I also was reminded about my appointment by phone",5
1574,19-Sep-15,"In my experience, working with many auto dealers can range from frustrating to downright exasperating. But my experience at Dana Ford was quite different. My sales representative, Mary Graffeo, was patient, insightful and super friendly as I narrowed down my options based on their offerings. She was extremely knowledgable about the products (she definitely knows her stuff!) and was able to gradually work through all the different vehicle options I had. She allowed me plenty time to test out multiple models until I arrived at my choice of a Ford Fusion, absent any rush or hassle. When it came time to crafting a deal, both Mary and Steve Riccardone took my considerations into account and made an enticing offer that I accepted even though I had little intention of closing a deal without first looking into several other manufacturers' models. But since Mary and Steve were able to find exactly what I was looking for and offer it at great price, there was no need to look elsewhere. For their attitude and friendliness alone, (not to mention the awesome car they set me up with) they each deserved my business and I was proud to make a deal with them. Truly, the best car-buying experience I've had and I highly recommend paying them a visit if you're shopping around! ",5
1575,18-Sep-15,We came to this dealer from NJ because their True Car price and low fees beat every dealer in our state.  Everyone was very helpful and friendly.  Very happy with the purchase and would definitely return!,5
1576,18-Sep-15,"On September 17, 2015 I called Dana Ford to ask when I could bring my Ford Escape back that was on a lease and almost over the mileage, they said come on down.  I dealt with 3 gentlemen, Juan Estrella who had my new car waiting there for me when I got there 1 hour later, Nouri Aktoup who had our paperwork printed and ready in less than 20 minutes and Mike Geib who showed us our car called our insurance and programmed my phone to the car in less than a half an our.  In all my 20 years at Ford I have never had such an easy enjoyable and stress free visit.  I would recommend this dealership to anyone.  I also own another Ford that is leased and was promised no headaches when that one goes back to re-lease.  These guys were The Best.....",5
1578,16-Sep-15,"I just bought a new car from the folks at Dana Motors and the experience was exceptional.  I was directed to Dana Motors by a friend that also had a great experience with the dealer.  My friend set
 the expectations very high and I am happy to report that my experience was very good.

The process from my first visit to the dealership to the moment I drove the car off the lot was professional, attentive and sincere.  Each person I met with understood their role and worked hard to make sure I was comfortable with anything discussed at that time.  I never felt an ounce of pressure to buy the car now or buy this upgrade.  I am now a happy Dana Ford customer.

Special thanks to Juan and his team in the control center and to Rich Thomasen for a job well done on the sales floor.

1591,03-Sep-15,"I wanted to shop around and a friend of mine just bought a car from Dana Ford.  I asked her who her salesperson was and she referred Justin Picca.  At first I wanted to go to Nissan in New Jersey to shop around for the Rogue but I decided to go to Dana Ford before going on the highway to New Jersey.  Upon walking in I was welcomed by the receptionist who was very friendly and professional which made me feel at ease.  I asked her if Justin was in and lucky for me he was.  Justin introduced himself and another gentleman name Sid I believe that was training.  At first I was a bit apprehensive because I don't want the salesman to be pushy and try to sell to me.  Justin was very professional and friendly and had a nice smile.  After our introductions and I told him who referred me to him, he knew who I was talking about and asked me what I was looking for.  I told him I was shopping around for a SUV and haven't made up my mind which one I was going to choose.  I wanted something small, affordable and safe in the winter months to come with all the snow we have been getting.  He was very informative and knowledgeble.  Also the inventory was very impressive.   After all that was said and done I wind up leasing a 2016 Ford Escape.  I never thought I would be leaving Dana Ford with a SUV but I did and I am very pleased with my new truck.  I would definitely refer Justin to any of my friends.  He is truly a sincere and professional young man with alot of potential.  It was a very impressive team at the dealership and my husband and I left feeling at ease.",5
1592,02-Sep-15,The entire team at Dana was great and very friendly through our entire car buying experience.  The inventory is impressive putting you in the best possible position to get the actual car you want.  Frank and Anthony both did a great job and really made our experience feel like a personal one.  The finance portion was a breeze and was handled by Jeff.. Literally took about 10 minutes.,5
1593,01-Sep-15,I chose Dana Ford for my new lease for their excellent customer service and great deals. Joby introduced himself to me as i walked into the dealership and instantly found the car i wanted with his polite and optimistic manors. I recommend Joby as a great salesman  for a good experience at Dana Ford.,5
1594,01-Sep-15,"This is the sixth car that I have gotten from Dana, since 2009. I have been dealing with Tom Annunziata for the past six years. He is more like a friend, than a car dealer. I value his opinion. I always leave satisfied, knowing that I got the best deal possible. He also has an assistant Raymond, that was so knowledgeable, and helpful. Definitely, a pleasurable experience.",5
1595,01-Sep-15,"After an exhausting and unproductive series of visits to Staten Island car dealerships and consulting Consumer Reports magazine, we decided to support the American worker and visit the Dana dealership. The receptionist welcomed us, establishing both a professional and supportive tone. We enjoyed walking through the impressive showroom while she summoned Joby Joseph, the sales representative, who invited us to sit in the lounge area and discuss our preferences while savoring some freshly brewed coffee. Joby, the consummate gentleman and professional, listened intently, recommended several models, and suggested he take us on a tour of the lot in a beautiful Ford Fusion. For 45 minutes, Joby patiently drove us around the lot and encouraged us to look at and sit in six Fusions. We were looking for specific exterior and interior colors.  Joby persevered and found the tectonic silver color with matching dune interior.. We went for a test drive on the local roads and the expressway. We decided that the Fusion SE was the car for us. We're so grateful to Joby for helping choose the ideal car for us. We'd also like to thank Jeff Beyer and Joi Appese for walking us through the financing aspect and Michael Angelone for thoroughly and patiently demonstrating the use of the extensive Ford technology. We will continue to highly recommend the Dana dealership to our family, friends, and colleagues.  ",5
1596,31-Aug-15,We truly hate car shopping. Very stressful. We went to many places on the island in New Jersey trying to get the best car car for us. We walked in to Dana and right away felt as ease. We had a great salesman. Joby made everything so smooth and we never felt any pressure. It was fun and we actually enjoyed our day with him. Jeff was also great helps us get our car of our dream! Thanks again guys!,5
1598,28-Aug-15,"I was in Staten Island and decide to stop by Dana Ford to check out a 2015 Ford Edge Sport. My salesman was John Hart. He was very professional and showed me the vehicle, and we went for a test drive and I was happy the vehicle. After the test drive, we went over the lease price options, and they give me an excellent deal, but I wanted to see what the competing dealers were offering. After checking out some other dealerships, I decide that Dana Ford had the best deal and chose to lease the vehicle from them. It was a pleasure dealing with John Hart, and I would buy from them in the future and would recommend Dana Ford as a good dealer to anyone looking for a good Ford dealership.",5
1599,28-Aug-15,"Just leased a car from this dealer. Best deal that I could of got. Was true to there word from the start to finish.. There even put a red bow on the car and I was able to take a picture with it. Never got that at BMW dealership. Could not ask for anything else.

See the manager Anthony Giagnacovo he is the best. I have been leasing cars now for twenty years and have to say he made this experience very enjoyable. Best price and a great person to talk to.
Salesman John Hart answered all my questions and informed me about things I never knew about with the car. Must see him if looking for a car. 
This dealership is very professional and will cater to all your needs.

The best was the price. I priced the car at other dealers and would not come close. I should of never wasted my time going over the bridge to New Jersey. Everyone talks about New Jersey and how nice there dealerships are. You don't buy a fish tank that you see when you walk in you buy the car.",5
1600,27-Aug-15,"Frank tripoli (sales consultant) and Anthony Giagnacovo (sales manager) could not have been more accommodating or helpful. Although we did not conclude with a sale as of today, since  I had specifics that just currently could not be met at this time, the offers that were made were fair, just not in the ballpark I was looking for. I still have 3 more months left on my lease, and will return to see if there are programs available at that time. This will be my 5th lease with this company. ",5

The place is absolutely beautiful. It does not look like a car dealership, more like a fancy hotel.
They handled my trade, my insurance, everyone was on top of their game.

I got there where I met Gennaro Esposito, MY Sales Consultant. He couldn't have been nicer, low-key and helpful. I felt no pressure and the whole experience was so very nice.  

I would recommend anyone to DANA and Gennaro - Just a hint if you are coming from NJ make sure your insurance is done as NJ Insurance companies are not open on SUNDAY  - totally my fault.

Sales Service was wonderful beginning with Frank Sinatra, our initial salesman, and finalizing with Matt, the sales/financial/knowledgeable all-around nice guy who is also Very competent AND personable.

This is the second car we have leased from Dana and most of the reasons we have done so has been the staff, from Maureen T and Chuck on the Lincoln side and those noted above on the Ford side.
KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK!

1620,18-Aug-15,"I leased a Ford Explorer and I have to say that the first day that I went a dealer named Blake showed us the cars and he was very patient and helpful . Unfortunately when I went back to lease the car he wasn't there so we leased the car from Mr Russo who must have shown us about 7 cars and that wasn't an easy task since he had to run back and forth getting keys in a 95 degree  day ...

CHARLES PUHAN, A VERY CAPABLE SERVICE REP, WAS MY POINT OF CONTACT FOR MY SERVICE VISIT.  ON PREVIOUS SERVICE VISITS CHUCK (CHARLES) WAS MY ADVOCATE FOR ENSURING THAT MY SERVICE WAS PERFORMED CORRECTLY AND IN A TIMELY MANNER.  THIS DEDICATED EMPLOYEE IS AN ASSET TO THE DANA FAMILY.  I INFORMED CHUCK THAT I WAS READY TO ROLL OVER MY LEASE FOR A NEW LINCOLN.  I ASKED IF HE COULD INTRODUCE ME TO AN AVAILABLE SALES REP WHILE MY CAR’S SERVICE WAS BEING PERFORMED.  I WAS ESCORTED AND INTRODUCED TO MR.  TOM ANNUNZIATA (LINCOLN SALES REP) A TRULY LOW-KEY, KNOWLEDGABLE, PERSONABLE, PEOPLE PERSON (MY LUCKY DAY).  TOM LISTENED, MADE SUGGESTIONS AND, IN LESS THAN THREE HOURS, I WAS DRIVING HOME IN A NEW LINCOLN.  TOM WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN ENSURING THAT WE FOUND THE RIGHT VEHICLE THAT FIT MY NEEDS AND MY BUDGET.  WITH THIS EXPERIENCE FRESH ON MY MIND, THE NEXT DAY (8/5/2015), I RETURNED TO DANA WITH MY DAUGHTER, WHO WANTED TO ROLLOVER HER LEASED VEHICLE (JEEP TO FORD).  WE SPECIFICALLY ASKED IF TOM COULD HELP US WITH MY DAUGHTER’S PURCHASE.  TOM ROSE TO THE OCCASION AND MADE HIMSELF AVAILABLE EVEN THOUGH HE WAS NOT A FORD SALES REP, THUS MAKING MY DAUGHTER’S PURCHASE A PLEASANT AND EASY EXPERIENCE.  THE EXPERTISE OF PEOPLE LIKE TOM AND CHUCK CONTRIBUTED TO A COMFORTABLE BUYING EXPERIENCE.  KUDOS TO TOM AND CHUCK.  CAN’T WAIT TILL MY SECOND DAUGHTER’S LEASE IS READY TO ROLL OVER (TOYOTA TO FORD).   I’M LOOKING FORWARD TO ANOTHER VISIT TO DANA.

I would recommend DANA Ford to friends and refer them to Joby - the service was first class and I left with a car that matches. 
Thanks Joby & DANA Ford!",5
1652,30-Jul-15,"Joby Joseph did a great job of helping me select my Lincoln MKX.. He is extremely knowledgeable of the MKX and its electronics. But what impressed me the most was he very carefully listened to all my questions and concerns and answered accordingly.  Joby is the kind of young man you want working for your own organization.  He represents Dana Lincoln with pride and distinction. I know they are proud of him and I'm loving the fact that I am now an ""X"" man.",5

1656,30-Jul-15,"We went to Dana Lincoln as our regular Ford dealer does not deal with Lincoln's.  Dana Lincoln was wonderful.  Our sales manager was a salesman whom we worked with before at another dealership.  Steve Riccardone took us to sales person who helped us decide what we wanted to get.  Mary Griffeo was wonderful.  She helped us but did not push us or urge us as other dealerships do.  She was patient and sweet.  After deciding to lease the MKZ, Matt Riccardone, Lincoln's finance manager made the lease an easy task and the signing went seamlessly.  It was wonderful to work with Dana Lincoln and we will give them a chance to change our mind to buy a Ford from them instead of the dealership we have worked with for 10 cars.  ",5

We were hoping we would be able to walk out from Dana with a car..and we did.  It was a very enjoyable experience.  We are a family of American cars.  My son purchased a Ford Mustang, Ford Fusion and Ford Taurus.  As this was a very unexpected event for us and we were a little strapped for cash, but the employees at Dana worked with us to enable us to walk out with a vehicle.  Mary G was an excellent salesperson.  She has a very good sense of humor which we needed and did a great job explaining all the details of the Ford Focus which we leased.

I found him to be extremely knowledgeable, made me feel very comfortable throughout the whole process, I didn't feel at all pressured (which in the past is something I found extremely irritating).We discussed the pros and cons of leasing and buying, which he described very definitively.  I had never considered leasing a car and in the end I leased.  When I am ready to either buy or lease an additional vehicle, I hope to deal with Joby again.

Also Matt Riccardone was very pleasant to deal with in the final stages of the paperwork.  For a man that young he comported himself very professionally.

Again, when I decide to buy or lease an additional vehicle, Joby is a major reason I will come back to Dana Ford",5

Boy was I wrong. The facility was amazingly roomy, bright, clean  and full of energy. As we opened doors to various vehicles we were greeted by the Oh so cheerful Mary Graffeo. Mary is so down to earth. She actually listened to our needs, provided us various options for our budget and gave us personal time to converse on the possible purchase. Mary definitely  understood how to treat a customer. Her patience was amazing. She was also very truthful on our expectations on a purchase along side with our budget. She made us very comfortable while we took up so much of her time with our interests in car features and budgets. 
      After meeting with Mary, we met with the finance manager Matt Riccardone. Matt was great, he explained every detail abs what every document meant. Careful to go over our options and answering all questions. He was conscious of our time and took time to build a consumer relationship with us. It felt God toa speak to someone who could relate with your on different levels.

1750,23-May-15,"What an incredible car shopping experience! I recently visited Dana Lincoln looking for my next car to lease. I am like many others out there that have had horrendous car shopping experiences and figured this visit would be no different from the others. Boy, was I wrong! From the moment I entered the dealership, I was treated like gold. Gennaro Esposito really listened to what my husband and I were looking for in a car. We had a lovely test drive where Gennaro took his time to explain the car to me and answer my questions.  I was only there for an HOUR between the test drive and agreeing to the lease price. I am usually on edge during the negotiations, but working with sales manager Nick Abruzzese was like working with my dad. He truly took care of me like I was part of his family, understanding that I had a budget to work with and looking to make sure I walked out of Dana a very, VERY happy customer. Gennaro and Nick truly surpassed my expectations. I came back to pick up the car once I returned my other leased vehicle and Dana had already taken care of changing my insurance. I met with Jeff at finance who quickly and carefully reviewed all of my paperwork with me. Pete gave us a thorough run through of how to use my new car (which I definitely needed, haha) and I was all set! Again, that visit only took 40 minutes (and was slightly longer due to Pete answering my many questions about the car). I would recommend Dana to any of my family and friends. I know I will be a LIFE LONG customer of Dana Motors! ",5

1789,30-Apr-15,"I am a native Staten Islander. Our Ford dealer used to be ""Island Ford"" on Richmond Avenue. Well to say the least, the transition of closing the old location and incorperating Ford into DANA's Dealership was a great choice. The showroom is classy,clean and beatifully set up. You are greeted immediately by a nice reception area when you walk in. Of course there are spotlessly clean Eye Catching vehicles surrounding you in the showroom to boot. The sales staff gives you space and doesn't HOUND you like many other dealers do. They are polite,attentive,professional,friendly and knowlegable in a tactful way. They will spend as much time as needed to make sure you are absolutely satisfied with you choice of vehicle. While waiting for Dealings/paperwork/credit to be run etc..there is a very nice waiting area including a coffee station and spring waters at No Charge to the customer. Also restrooms of course.  Also theres a vending machine. Nice perks. The staff were really nice. My salesperson Joby J. was very accomodating,helpful and polite. The finance Manager Mike was very fast and professional with obtaining my credit approval for my 2015 Ford Escape 4WD Titanium. All paperwork was printed out professionally and organized opposed to old handwritten invoices that other dealers use that appear to be chicken scratch to possibly slip ""schemes"" into your contract. Not here! much different. The Salesmanager Steve is a really nice guy also. He made sure everything was up to par and I was happy with my price and vehicle choice throughout the whole experience. After all was said and done, my New Escape was prepped,cleaned and was given to me nice and shiny ready to enjoy. Bottom Line, Shopping for a car or the right dealer isn't easy for most people. If you are apprehensive or confused about where to get your new ford, lincoln, new car or pre-owned etc.. DANA SHOULD BE YOUR FIRST AND ONLY CHOICE. Besides all I have said, I forgot to mention they have a HUGE selection of inventory and you will surely find a vehicle you will love that will suit you and/or your families needs. I'm just a customer,no affiliation to them at all but I just wanted to share this with all of you who are looking for a reliable place to shop cause I would want the same help if I were you. I hope this was helpful. Good luck with finding your new vehicle at Dana : )    5 STARS ALL THE WAY!!!!!!!!!!!  Jay E. from STATEN ISLAND,NY",5

I have been to a few dealers Ford dealers and I can say hands down this is the best dealership I have been to.

Starting with Muhammad Naeem, then going to Roy Alston and finishing up with Steve Riccardone, it was overall a great experience and they did their best in working with me and my needs. Car buying is very stressful and most times a drawn out process, but they do a great job of getting you in and out as quick as possible while satisfying your needs and staying within your budget. ",5
1799,24-Apr-15,"Yes, you read that right.  I had searched all over Massachusetts for the exact car I wanted.  When that failed, I extended my search across the country.  Dana Ford had exactly what I wanted.  I called the dealership and got the Pre-Owned Sales Manager (Mike), and he and I talked about the car (he was very knowledgeable), we then negotiated a fair price over the phone.  As you can imagine, I was very skeptical, but Mike assured me that I was getting a gem.  He then shipped it to my house.  When the car arrived, I was very pleased.  It was exactly what I wanted and in perfect shape.  Everyone thought I was crazy to buy a car sight un-seen, and un-driven, but I had faith in Mike and Dana Ford.  This experience was a bit of a risk, but well worth it.  I got exactly what I wanted.  Go buy your next vehicle from Dana, you won't regret it.",5

When I walked in, the dealer I was supposed to meet was tied up.  They didn't leave me waiting.  Anthony Felline stepped in and really took care of me.  He showed around the lot, which had a full selection.  It's definitely the biggest lot in the 5 boroughs.  I was in the market for a 2015 Lincoln MKZ.  I told Anthony what features I wanted and he was able to put something together for me that day on the spot.  They even gave me a better finance rate than my bank of 5 years.  Considering what I had to go through to get out to the lot, he really went the extra mile to make sure I went home with a car that day.

I originally walked into my local Lincoln dealership in Brooklyn, NY and I was very disappointed at the way that I was treated. That's when I went to Dana Lincoln in Staten Island before giving up on leasing a Lincoln altogether. I am truly amazed with this dealership and would highly recommend using them even if it's a drive from where you live. They were professional, kind, courteous, returned my phone calls quickly, gave me a great deal and they held true to their words- there were no added fees at the last minute. The day that I leased my car everything went very smoothly and easily. I was still there after closing and no one rushed anything. When I finally got into my new car- it was about an hour after closing. My salesman Tom Caccese spent quite awhile patiently explaining to me all the controls, information display, my lincoln touch and other technology in the car. He also paired my phone and helped me enter destinations in the navigator. He answered all my questions and  told me to call or come back if I had anymore questions. Thank you Tom! Thanks to Roy Aston as well for making my experience so enjoyable and easy and for the great deal!
Dana Lincoln exceeded my expectations! I would definitely be back! Check them out if you like to be treated well ;)",5

Thanks, Dana...and Maureen!

We were in and out on the same day that our car was shipped in by truck. Amazing to have it all work in such a timely fashion. Also, the new showroom is top notch. Very comfortable and relaxing.

By the way, the car is GREAT! Lincoln has done an excellent job on updating and fixing some of the details to make an excellent car.

1859,27-Mar-15,"I've had the pleasure of working with Maureen Tucci as my Service Advisor the last two times I needed service. She always makes me feel valued as a customer. Maureen checks my MKS in and asks what I need to have done. Once we go over my vehicles needs, she escorts me into the waiting room and offers me a beverage. Maureen gives me updates periodically and we finish up the paperwork quickly when my car is ready. She is truly as asset to the Service Department, and Lincoln as a whole. I'm looking forward to working with her again.  ",5

1861,27-Mar-15,"I have recently begun to have my two Fords serviced at Dana.  I have found them to be both honest and efficient.  They made good on a battery for my Mustang that checked out with two dead cells.  The battery was purchased a year ago, and they replaced it.  My Explorer had developed a loud ""rumbling"" noise over the last month.  It progressively got lowder.  I took it in to Dana and Mark had his fine mechanic Danny check it out.  It turned out the front and rear differentials were shot and needed replacement.  After a week, parts had to be ordered, my truck was ready and drives like new. ",5
1862,27-Mar-15,"I have leased 4 cars with Dana already. I've had 2 Lincoln's and 2 Fords. Each and every experience was pleasant. I felt completely satisfied and felt I was given the best deal possible. I always ""shop around"" and still make my way back to Dana.

Maybe next time i'll get an even better deal!   ; )

The Finance manager Michael Passaro is the man you want to deal with if at all possible. I know there are many there but I must say this guy is one of the most friendly I have dealt with at this dealership making the final steps of delivery an pleasant experience.

1870,22-Mar-15,"From Reception thru the entire process I was treated with courtesy & respect. My first impression of sales associate Marvin Durazno was very positive, he radiated high energy & good attitude from the very start & maintained it throughout our interaction. I was responding to a mail offer from Dana Ford/Lincoln regarding upgrading my vehicle from a 2008 Ford Escape, vehicles I was interested in were 2015 Escape or Fusion. Marvin took me for test drives of both vehicles, explained the different features of each & showed himself as someone who really knew the product. He listened carefully to my needs regarding the trade in on my Escape & how much I could afford in down payment & monthly payments & then working with Sales Manager Stephen Riccardone & Finance Manager Michael Passaro negotiated what I felt was a great deal. The entire process was as stress free as this type of major purchase can be. I am completely satisfied & love my new Fusion.",5

1873,19-Mar-15,"My salesperson is Mary Graffeo at Dana Ford Lincoln.  She is knowledgeable and courteous.  My buying experience went far beyond purchasing the car.  Firstly, Mary answered every question I had about the difference between my current model vehicle and the 2015 Mustang, which is revamped from the bottom up and inside-out.  She kept me up to date as to when I would be able to order my vehicle, as convertibles were not available at the release of the new models.  Next, she called me the second  Mustangs came in in the colors I was considering so that I could see hands on rather than order from a color chart.  The very day they were able to order a convertible Mary called me in and sat with my family as we went through every option.  The managers gave me the leasing rates and options that suited my lifestyle.  I am proud to say that ordering that day allowed me to be the first person on Staten Island, if not NYC, to drive away in a 2015 Mustang Convertible.  
Mary provided such friendly, personal service that I will see only her for my future vehicle needs.  The supporting staff at Dana accommodated my family such that we will be Dana customers for life!  When my car arrived Mary texted me a picture of it immediately and even brought the signing papers to me when I couldn't get down to the dealership.  I highly recommend that anyone shopping for a vehicle see Mary Graffeo at Dana Ford Lincoln in Staten Island.

1914,07-Feb-15,"My car showed the oil was needed to be changed and would usually do so on my own, but after the stellar customer service from my last experience at Dana, I thought I'd double down and press my luck and avoid changing oil in the freezing cold. Dealership conducted a general inspection which is expected. As a mechanic myself I have a tendency to ignore minor niggles and let larger problems arise. Other dealerships I've dealt with would have never physically brought me a part in need of change for my input, they typically would change it, throw out the part regardless if it was bad or good, and made me pay for service that was not necessary in my opinion. Dana's mechanics and techs are certified and experts in their own right, and could have made the decision on their own to clean, adjust, and install said parts, but actually came to me for my opinion with their suggestions. Like it should be. Like I've stated before, totally revamped service department, excellent customer treatment, and in my humble opinion as a trained machinery technician, great craftsman ship (clean shop, and where work was conducted under hood everything was wiped down and secured properly. Great stuff. Not to mention the free car wash getting caked up rock salt off completely. ",5

Once I visited, I got a deal that far surpassed my expectations. Joby Joseph was an absolute pleasure to work with. I’ve been in finance as a broker for over 20 years and I know quality (in a salesperson) when I see it. I also have to compliment Michael Passaro for his knowledge and tremendous professionalism.

He made sure I had a comfortable place to work as I waited. Matthew did everything possible to make sure I was satisfied with my experience.

1922,20-Jan-15,"i just purchased a 2015 Ford Fusion.  I wasn't planning on buying another Ford, but in December my tire was damaged while driving on the highway.  I went to Dana that rainy saturday and was greated by Jeff Pikarsky. Unfortunately, Dana didn't have the tire, but Jeff went out of his way to send someone to pick up the tire in Jersey on a rainy saturday so I wouldn't have to wait until Monday. Because I had to wait a while for my tire, Jeff made sure I got a free oil change and even had my car washed.  Litlle did Jeff know that the great service he provided made me decide to go with Ford for my next car.   A month later I came in to get my new car and was greated by the sales rep, Joby Joseph. Joby was friendly, helpful courteous and treated my wife and I great.  Thank you Joby, Jeff and Mike Passaro for your great customer service.

1932,10-Jan-15,"After dealing with Scarsdale Ford for many years, we have just moved into the area and were welcomed by Dana Ford with opening arms from their service department and overall dealership. 

Just recently, we visited the service department several times and dealt with Matthew Azriel who has been exceptional in representing Dana Ford and thats one of reasons why they have sold my next car. ",5
1933,09-Jan-15,"We were very happy with the service we received at Dana Ford! Marvin, our salesman, had the perfect approach for us. Friendly, sincere, energetic, and warm. We never felt hustled. The car business has such a reputation that we came in ready for battle, but Marvin immediately disarmed us with his candor and we could tell right away that he was on the level. Being treated with such dignity and respect made us think we could feel good about giving our money to Dana Ford. There was really a first-class, VIP feeling about the whole encounter. My 70 year old mother and infant daughter stayed in the waiting area for the six hours we were there, and both Marvin and the rest of the team went out of their way to make sure they had everything they needed to feel comfortable, from free espresso to a children’s playroom. One of the most important factors for us was how everything felt from the heart, not phony. Marvin really went above and beyond the calf of duty in a way we wouldn’t have expected. Replacing the car battery (at our request) meant that our newly purchased car would have to pass inspection again. But because it was evening and the garage crew had gone home, we would have to bring the car back the next day. When Marvin realized what a disappointment that was to us, he himself came to Brooklyn the next day, brought our car back to SI while we were at the office, passed it through the inspection and brought it back to Brooklyn again, all on his own time. Talk about going the extra mile! We would highly recommend Dana Ford, and Marvin, to anyone looking for a new vehicle.",5

Mike Angelone is a salesman of the same caliber. He too strives to please while maintaining professionalism, courtesy and his knowledge of the product he is selling. Jeff Beyer is the ""The Finance Man"". This is one guy you should request to see when you buy your car. He is a friendly ""no pressure "" person who will explain the different options available to you in terms of financing, warranty, and accessories for your new car. Martin Franklin is the Parts and Service Director. In addition to being the most knowledgeable Ford Service person in these parts of the USA, he is Customer Service oriented, making sure the customer is always satisfied. His Service writer Jeff Pikarsky will ensure your car gets the very best service you and your vehicle are entitled to. These are the people I deal with at Dana.

From the nice receptionist to Tom C to John H (new salesperson who helped me) to the finance person (sorry, don't remember his name).  Last buy definitely not least is the service I received from Joe Bogigian.  He made me feel comfortable with the entire leasing process and made it extremely easy from start to finish.  He showed an extremely high level of integrity and even went so far as to let me know that my wife (who will be the primary driver) can call him at any time if she needs help with anything or has any questions.  Tom, John and Joe - thank you for making this experience a pleasant one!",5

But some people that are working at finance, Nouri Aktouf,  and the one who take care of DMV registration,  Gabriela Agudelo, are not professional at all. Gabriela did not take care of our DMV registration. I was waiting over 1 month and a half for registration, and if i wouldn't call she will never call us to tell what happend. And when we called she just told us a stupid reason why the registration is not done, instead of accepting that she didn't take care of it.

But again what is about Joby Joseph and all the other people that we worked with, except the 2 that i nominate them above, are very professional people.",5

I was impressed with Tom from the moment I entered the showroom, which I might say offers all the luxury of a top dealership. Tom is soft spoken and what most impressed me is his ""soft sell."" I felt I could trust him and that I was with a ""friend"" from the moment we began working together. I was so impressed with his honesty that I couldn't help but remarking to Tom how much I liked him. Tom offered me a beautiful car, in excellent condition, at the best price possible. I am a senior citizen, not well, and was very insecure when I first entered the dealership. Tom made me feel as if I were with my son. He knew everything there was to know about the car. He never lost patience with me no matter how annoying I may have gotten, and he offered me continued help in the future. I can promise you that I will continue to send all of my friends and family to Tom, at Dana, because I am certain they will be treated fairly and get the best deal possible.",5

2004,11-Dec-14,"This dealership by far offered the best choices and prices when we came in to lease a Lincoln MKZ (Hybrid). They had 132 MKZ's in stock so we had a great choice in color and options. The managers and sales staff were willing to negotiate, and negotiated a more than fair price, in conjunction with a Lincoln. The price was virtually unbeatable and there were no last minute fees or changes, as with other dealerships.

It was truly an easy process which you don't hear too many times when people discuss auto purchases. See you again in a few years",5
2012,10-Dec-14,"It all started with our test drive of a Ford Explorer Sport. The sales associate who took us on the test drive was Joby. The first thing that surprised me is how willing he was to allow us to take the car on a proper drive. Most dealerships will take you around the block, and when you're about to spend a boat load of money on a brand new car, that's not right. Joby took us on a very long test drive and didn't mind that we put the car through its paces on a couple of occasions. The dealership is in a convenient location, and is very modern and well maintained. The vehicle selection is huge, and if you're looking to place a factory order, they're a great dealership as major dealers will be able to get your order to you faster than small dealerships. Right from this day, we knew we had made the right decision to venture out to DANA in Staten Island.

We went ahead with a factory order 1 week after our test drive. All paperwork was completed with our input and the whole process of placing an order was incredibly quick and simple. After waiting about 6 weeks, Joby gave me a call to let us know that our car was ready. We headed into the dealership one evening and Joby even showed up on his day off to make sure that we were fully satisfied when picking up our brand new car. This dedication was astounding, and we're very glad that Joby was the guy handling our purchase. For any future purchases, we'll definitely only be heading Joby's way, and I'd highly recommend anyone looking to do business with DANA to personally ask for Joby - you won't be disappointed. It was a pleasure working with Joby and we're looking forward to future purchases from him.",5
2013,10-Dec-14,"My car wouldn't start when I visited the dealer to look at new cars. They jump started the car, took it .into service and put in a new battery. They did this in a short period of time despite a very busy service center.",5

He took us on a test drive, helped us compare the new vehicle to the one we currently had, and patiently answered all of our questions. After deciding to lease the Ford Edge, we worked out the lease details with Sales Manager, Joe Bogigian, who was also a pleasure to work with. Mr. Bogigian had checked in on us numerous times throughout our visit and gave us a fair price on the lease.

2028,08-Dec-14,"After searching pretty much every ford dealer in Brooklyn and queens. I ended up at Dana ford the other dealers just refused to work with me. I already knew what truck I was looking for and had my mind set. Upon arrival I was greeted by Liliana she was very pleasant and helpful. I explained what I wanted and how much I wanted to pay. I explained the other dealers would not work with me and I had no problem going to NJ if they will not work on my price. Liliana assured me she would get me the truck I wanted at a price I would like. We found the perfect truck and began the negotiating that was a little challenging. But again Liliana made it a lot more plesent. The first sales manager we worked with was no good then Liliana brought over Juan. Between Jaun's help and Liliana's excellent customer service I decided to buy a brand new 2015 explorer limited. I cannot speak about the rest of the staff at this dealer but if you visit this dealer you must see Liliana and Juan you will not be disappointed. My cousin is also negotiating a deal for the same truck and I'm certain between Juan and Liliana they will make him happy and a new owner. I have dealt with many dealers in my time and I will undoubtably recommend this dealership to all my friends and family. 

Thanks again
Liliana & Juan

Everytime I am out and about , I get questions on my new Cmax, explaining how much I love the fact it doesn't use that much electric or gas. It is very quiet sometimes not sure if it is on.

The manager at Dana Ford (Mr. Joe Bogigian) was a no hassle, no pressure, and very professional gentleman which came in with an extremely fair lease price. I have purchased many cars from Mercedes Benz, Bmw, Infinniti, Volvo, Lexus, to Honda, Toyota, etc and like I said the past 6 years ford. Joe Bogigan and his sales asscociate Mr. Steve Conti as well the finaice manager (Mr. Joe Frank) both made my wife and I feel so comfortable that this was the only time (ever) there was no pressure at all.

2150,13-Aug-14,Joe Bogigian and his sales associate Justin Somers made buying a car pleasurable.  There was no  nonsense taken like other dealerships have done in my experience in the past.  I highly recommend them for your shopping experience.,5
2152,06-Aug-14,"From the first moment we entered Dana Ford Lincoln, we were impressed.  We were greeted by a friendly receptionist who welcomed us! 

We had the pleasure of meeting Steven Conti who took us around to see various vehicles and were extremely knowlegable and courteous.  Once we decided on the vehicle that was right for our business, Steve Riccardone handled our financing and paperwork.  He too was wonderful and made the experience quick and painless. To round it all off, Doug Hansen the manager completed our experience with his upbeat attitude and stellar customer service.

All in all, our experience with Dana Ford Lincoln has been superb.  I would recommend anyone in the market for a Ford/Lincoln vehicle to go visit them.",5

Special thanks to Joe Bogigian, Sales Manager who went out of his way to assist us and get us into the vehicle of our choice and at the price we could afford and no way near anyone else could offer us.  I have purchased many vehicles in my life and many Fords (and Lincolns) and without a doubt the best experience I ever had.  Such a nice change of pace from the all the other dealerships I have purchased from.  I cannot recommend Dana Ford, Joe and his staff any more highly.  Our salesman, Keenan was wonderful, nice, friendly, non-pressuring, and alert to all our needs and requests.  Financing and the paperwork execution was a breeze with Nouri.",5
2155,31-Jul-14,"The salesman at Dana Ford, Richard Lotito's customer service approach is excellent. He showed me the type of car(Ford Fusion) at the dealership that I was interested in and was very informative and helpful in helping me to understand the entire car purchase process. He also arranged a test drive for us in one of the Fusion vehicles. There was a problem in getting the color of the car I wanted to purchase from the dealership and after waiting for some time and dealing with a few bumps in the road, the issue was resolved by the Sales Manager, Joe Bogigian, who upgraded me to another higher end vehicle at Dana Ford for an agreed upon upgrade price. Joe made sure my wife and I were treated courteously and made us feel comfortable with the entire new car purchase experience. I highly recommend this sales team of Joe and Richard at Dana.

I was going on a last minute road trip and needed my car to be serviced before the trip.  I did not have an appointment and Joe Bogigian and Dave Diorio were very accommodating.  They were able to arrange my car to be serviced and it was done in a timely matter. They understood my last minute situation and did not turn me away. Instead, they walked me over to the customer lounge area and offered me refreshments and let me know that my car will be done in one hour. Sure enough an hour passed and my truck was ready.  Jeff who was my service rep explained exactly what service they performed on my truck and then walked me out the dealer. The staff is amazing. I highly recommend this dealership. ",5

I had dealt Joe B from the minute i walked in all he wanted was my husband and i to be happy with a car that we purchased. Joe B made this experience the easiest and not nerve wrecking at all. We dont have the best credit but he got us a car  and got us to the payments we need to be at... The dealership itself was so accommodating that they even just built a play room for kids that would allow us to sit down with Joe B without our 4 yr old pulling nagging for our attention. Joe B is the man and i will now tell everybody and anybody i know to go in and deal with him ",5
2164,07-Jul-14,"This dealership is excellent!!!  Just received my second mustang in the last two weeks. Of all the years I bought/leased cars Dana Ford genuinely cares about the customer and works within your budget.  The showroom is clean, spacious and family oriented.

I have no desire to do the sit there and wait for five hours to make a deal scenario- I cant stand it - Bobby and Joe were very nice and pleasant to deal with and worked with me.

2167,30-Jun-14,"I was so apprehensive about my visit expecting to be disrespected/taken advantage of because I am a woman. My experience was just the opposite.

I will definitely recommend Dana Ford to family and friends.  ",5

2170,25-Jun-14,"Our visit to Dana Ford was to return my leased 2011 Escape with no intentions of leasing or buying another vehicle. We were met by Joe Bogigian, sales manager, to help us with the return. He was very friendly, knowledgeable, understood our needs and concerns. He asked if he could show us the new Escape without pressuring us. We talked some numbers and he made the new Escape fit our budget. We've been buying and leasing cars for the last 40 years and Joe is by far the easiest and most knowledgeable person we've ever dealt with. We would definitely recommend to friends and family they go see Joe for their next vehicle.",5
2173,18-Jun-14,"I had an exceptional great experience with Dana Ford! From setting up my appointment with Margie, Joe working and extending himself 100% and working hardly within my budget, color of car, etc., and Sam showing us all the cars and features, made us make the right choice. They are professional, warm and friendly and understand all your needs.  I have never been in a car dealership who offers us all this.  These were caring individuals that went way beyond their call of duty and my family deeply appreciates it.  We established a relationship with the dealer and the speed and efficiency was excellent. I would refer anyone to Dana Lincoln for any car you need. ",5

I didn't have that much time to wait, but David Diorio went above and beyond my expectations and located the exact car i was looking for, and rather quickly I might add. The whole team is a pleasure to do business with which is why Ive been dealing with Dana for so many years. 

I Love my new Ford Explorer Sport!! ",5
2180,30-May-14,"I must say that I never thought it possible to have a pleasurable car buying experience.....however I was wrong as both Matt & Joe did accomplish what i once thought impossible.

Thank you,

2182,29-May-14,"Dana Ford was not the first dealership on my list. That being said, I had read some not so nice online reviews (not from dealerRater my mistake) and was very disappointed so decided to bypass Dana.  Long story short after months of researching and doing my homework I decided to visit Dana Ford on my lunch hour and I must say..... Dana scored an "" A"" that day due to excellent customer service, patience, knowledge and most importantly, comfortability that I felt.  Not to mention, I signed on the dotted line for my new Ford Explorer.  So without further adieu  ""Thank you"" Dana Ford for a wonderful customer experience and my ""New Ford Explorer!""  Also, a very special thank you to Frank Curry for the exceptional customer during and after my purchase!  99% of my job deals with customer satisfaction, so it felt good to be on the receiving end!  No buyers remorse for sure! ",5

I don't mind traveling from Long Island to Staten Island each time I get a new car because at Dana they treat their customers like family and always do right by them. Joe Bogigian, Frank Curry and Doug Hansen went above and beyond to make sure that I was happy with my selection and had everything I needed. I continually recommend Dana to everyone I know interested in buying/leasing a car. ",5
2184,27-May-14,The staff was extremely accommodating to me and my mother. They made us feel extremely comfortable and left a tremendous impression on us. We will definitely be back because of these employees and the dealerships accommodations.,5

2191,12-May-14,"Sales Manager Joe Bogigian made my leasing experience a breeze to say the least. I was unsure about leasing and had many questions which he was glad to answer and fully explained with much patience to me before I made my decision. I was greeted with a smile and the mustang I was interested in was immediately ready for me to test drive. I wanted a different color that was not in stock and Joe gladly ordered exactly what I wanted. When I got the call the car was in he again took me for a test drive and explained the vehicle from top to bottom. Spent a good amount of time going over the finance paper work and was fully informed with respect and politeness. Thanks to Joe Bogigian I drove my new mustang home today and I look forward to buying or leasing again with Joe at Dana Ford Staten Island, NY",5

My salesman Tom Annunziata was extremely knowledgeable and was able to guide me through the options of buying verse leasing.  Today was Mother's Day and I went back to test drive.  The car handled beautifully but equally as important Tom helped me decide what options suited my needs.  Two hours later I was driving my new car home.  I still can't believe that on a Sunday he had it detailed, inspected and had license plates affixed.

2195,05-May-14,"I went car shopping at DANA FORD last week to look for a new vehicle. Where i was greeted by Anthony M Giagnacovo, he made us feel comfortable at the showroom,showed us around and guided us through the available cars there.
  I am writing to you to let you know this was my best car shopping experience ever. The salesman was very informative and he was answering very tough questions of ours patiently, I purchased a FORD FOCUS TITANIUM from him that day.
  Nowadays, it is commonly said that car salesmen just dont do a good enough job, and there only objective is to get money out of your wallet.But salesman like Mr. Giagnacovo delivers an incredible service and a very pleasant experience.
  I have and will continue to highly recommend Mr. Giagnacovo and Dana Ford to my family and friends for future car purchases.

2196,04-May-14,"All the employees we dealt with at Dana Ford were wonderful. We spent six hours there in one day and bought a new car for me, leased a pick-up truck for my son and bought a commercial van for my husband. Each salesperson or employee that we encountered was very knowledgeable and helped us make all the right decisions whether it was about the purchase, or the financing aspect of each transaction.  I already started recommending Dana Ford to my friends and family who are interested in a new vehicle.",5
2197,02-May-14,"I have used this dealership for over 8 years for every car our household has.  I always have an excellent experience.  This time our daughter who is almost 23 yrs old wanted to lease a Ford Fiesta.  She is a full time college student who also works as a hostess/waitress.  Our usual salesman, Roy was off that day.  We had a new salesman, Sam C who went fully out of his way, just like Roy always does to help our daughter pick a fully loaded car that loved and along with Mitch and Joe (in finance) worked out a price she could afford all on her own!  Never will we go anywhere else for a car!",5
2198,30-Apr-14,"In general, my past experiences buying a car have been like visiting the dentist... something I have to do but don't look forward to.  However, I was pleasantly surprised when we visited Dana Ford.  My husband and I planned to just go in to look. We weren't even sure if we wanted an SUV or car,  lease or buy, at that time.  We were greeted by a young salesman, Ryan Legg, who was very pleasant and knowledgeable.  He was able to answer all our questions and gave us great information which helped us make our final decision.  Dave Diorio, the GM, was pleasant and helpful, too.  .  We never felt pressured or stressed.  When it was time to talk to the financial manager, my husband and I were prepared for the usual ""sales talk"" and were preparing excuses to leave.  Well, let me tell you, Steve Riccardone, is the best!  All finance managers should be like him.  He presented the options thoroughly but quickly, gave us a moment to think about it and moved on.  He went above and beyond to make sure we received all discounts we qualified for under our lease.  It was the first time in our lives that we walked out of a dealership truly happy!!  It's been only a week now, but we are happy with our vehicle (a car, by the way), we were happy with our experience at the dealership and we look forward to telling our family and friends about it.   We will definitely go back to Dana Ford!  Also, when I went back to Steve to give him some paperwork that he needed, I met Joe Bogigian, a sales manager, who went out of his way to give me some ""Ford"" goodies, (magnets, and key holders) for me AND my husband!

2199,26-Apr-14,"Not much more to say, the team at Dana FL are the best. Doug Hansen has sold me my last 7 or 8 vehicles and every time the experience is a delight. Shaunna knows her stuff too.

I would recommend Dana FL every time...",5

",5
2201,24-Apr-14,"The salesman, Rich Harley, is a pleasure to deal with. Knows his stuff and has the right temperament for a job like this. I don't like overly aggressive sales people, and that's not his style. It's the 2nd time I've dealt with him and hopefully there will be a 3rd a few years from now. As for the dealership, I've gotten really good lease prices from them, but you may need to haggle a bit. No different than any other dealer, though. They get my recommendation. ",5
2202,24-Apr-14,"Thanks to a great staff and of course Joe Bogigian my service visit to Dana Motors was a short one. Joe is always there to try to help you out. I was there for a minor problem I spoke to Joe about it, he was able to speed things up so I was out in time to make a very important commitment. As for the problem it was taken care of by some of the best mechanics around.Thanks Joe, for you help again.",5
2204,19-Apr-14,"My husband and I have been customers of Dana for at least 25 years.  I knew the first time I walked in the door all those years ago that they would always do everything possible to satisfy their customers. Over the years they have proven that over and over again, none more so than the experience we had today.  We typically lease 2 new vehicles every two years.  Our lease term was up this week so we brought the cars back to Dana.  Due to unforeseen financial circumstances we were in no position to lease two cars this time. We were going to have to go into a used car. We left the dealership yesterday settling on a used car.  When we returned today to pick up the car, Joe Bogigian informed us that he had put together a deal to put us in a new car at the price we could afford.  We were stunned. Between Joe B, Joe Frank in finance, as well as the general manager and our salesperson Tomasz I know they all worked extremely hard to help us at this difficult time.  There are no words I can use to express our gratitude.  Everyone at Dana treats their customers like family.  If you want a great car buying or leasing experience I urge you to deal with Dana. You will not be sorry.",5
2205,19-Apr-14,A very pleasurable experience. The process was easy and Tommy Annunziata (salesman) and Stephen Riccardone (Finance Mgr) were both very helpful and walked us through every step. They both were great !,5
2206,19-Apr-14,"I leased my first Ford Fusion six years ago from Island Ford. When they closed abruptly, I contacted Dana to get some information. The staff was very informative, courteous and inviting. I arrived at Dana to complete my end of lease procedure and was overwhelmed at the excellent customer service I received from Tom Annunziata. I decided after meeting with him to obtain another lease and have never regretted that decision.
I just leased the Ford Escape and I am once again highly impressed with the entire dealership. Everyone from sales, finance and service departments are not only efficient and accommodating but genuinely love their jobs.
I highly recommend this dealership and do so on a daily basis. I hope anyone whom may read this takes the time to visit the staff of Dana Ford. I am absolutely certain you will be satisfied! ",5
2207,16-Apr-14,"My husband and I have had negative experiences at other car dealerships, so when the time came to buy a new car, we expected the worst. We went to Dana because we were interested in the Explorer. Matt, our salesperson, greeted us at the door and was very helpful without being pushy. Within an hour, we traded in our old vehicle for a good price for a new lease which was cheaper than out previous car payment. When I picked up my new car, THE NEXT DAY, Matt walked me through the car in detail and I left satisfied and knowledgeable about my new car's features. Steve in the finance department was very professional and never tried to ""hard sell"" anything. Bottom line, an overall great experience. The first time I left a car dealership without that ""icky"" feeling. I would highly recommend Dana.",5
2209,10-Apr-14,"Mr. Martin Franklin, the service director at this dealership, has proven, time and time again, to be a true champion of customer service.
I have had two situations requiring service on my 2013 Ford Fusion. 
Both of them were handled with empathy, professionalism and lightning speed !!!
I will always be a customer of Dana Ford and hopefully, Mr. Franklin will always be at the pivotal helm to steer the new expansion.
Being in sales and customer service for many years, I believe that this gentleman is a tremendous asset in his ability to put himself in the customers place --- KUDOS to Mr. Franklin, appreciate him as I do, he will make Dana and his customers very proud.

 I would also like to mention Ms. Jeanine Morales, at the service writers desk. 
This exceptional lady called me while I was at a business convention in Las Vegas. I was in the shower and rushing all morning. The news was
not good. I reacted quite unprofessionally !!  Through it all, Ms. Morales remained calm and in control. She promised that my sentiments would be brought to Mr. Franklin. I was contacted within 2 hours with a resolution that satisfied all.
I have to say that after meeting Jeanine, I immediately apologized for my bad behavior on the phone. Upon talking to her, I found her to be 
a great customer service person. She was intelligent, professional and easy to talk to. Jeanine waited with me until my vehicle was delivered.
I actually offered her a position in my new business endeavor !!!! This lady is a true asset to Dana Ford, as she would be to any person or business needing a team member of such exceptional quality.

Kudos and thanks to both Mr. Franklin and Ms. Morales.
I told Mr.Franklin that I would be glad to act as Customer Appreciation Ambassador any time, anywhere.-- just say the word !!!
In closing, I very highly recommend this dealership and these fine people who continue to strive for great customer service.

Most sincerely;

Daniel Weishoff

2210,09-Apr-14,"From the moment I entered the dealership I felt no pressure.  Shaunna listened to what we wanted and matched us up with the perfect car.  She took us for a test drive. She didn't pressure us with unnecessary chatter. She gave us time and space to decide. We asked for time to talk over the deal and that is what we got. No one chasing us out the door.  When we were ready, we came back and sealed the deal. We LOVE our new Ford Escape.  Thank you Shaunna. I would recommend doing business with Dana and with Shaunna. Very professional and FAST. No hours and hours waiting even when we picked up the car.  Most of the work was completed before we got back to get the car.  Again, a fast, easy deal with a professional!

2214,06-Apr-14,"I searched the entire tri-state area dealer network looking for a clean, low mileage CPO MKX.  I found a car to consider at Dana.  I was introduced to Jose, the salesman who treated me great.  He was exceptionally well versed on the vehicle and explained all of the special features the car had to offer.  He never pressured me to make a deal and once we began to negotiate treated me fairly and with a great deal of respect.  I plan on purchasing another car from him in the next 6 months and would HIGHLY recommend dealing with him and the Dana Ford dealership.  It was a very positive experience.  ",5
2215,03-Apr-14,"My wife and I went to Dana Ford to look at a 2014 Ford Explorer.  Kevin was very helpful and informative answering our many questions. He was not pushy and very patient with us while we were deciding on the many options availabe on the Explorer. . While it is thought to be a very stressful experience, Kevin made the purchase of our new Explorer very pleasant. On car pick up day, Kevin was unable to be there but he had Jose Navares stand in for him. Jose was very personable and pleasant in getting me accustomed to the new car. The finance side of the purchase went very smoothly as Steve in finance took the time to clearly explain all of my alternatives. He wasn't pushy and let me make the decisions without any pressure. All in all, I have my new car and I would have no problem recommending this dealership to my friends and family. ",5
2216,27-Mar-14,"This is the  3rd time I have purchased a Ford Escape from Dana Ford and I will not go anywhere else.  Starting with Bob Ingrassia to everyone else that helped me,  I am not going to go to any other dealer.  

This is the 2nd Ford Escape that Bob Ingrassia helped me with.  He is very professional and attentIve and listens to what you are saying instead of trying to ""oversell"" to me.  His friendly manner also made the experience easy for me and my husband.  I came to have my Escape inspected and wound up trading it in for the car of my dreams!  truly love my new car!  Also I was given several payment options to chooses from. and
most importantly, I never felt that I was pushed into a deal that I didn't want to make.

Me and Bob have a date 2 years from now to trade in my Escape for a new one for my 65th birthday and my husband is going to trade in his 
Titanium next year and we look forward to Bob Ingrassia helping us again!

Peace Out!

2217,25-Mar-14,"The experience at Dana Ford Lincoln is always pleasurable as this is my third time back to them. Their attention to customer satisfaction is second to none. They work to get you in a vehicle that you want to be in at the best competitive prices wether buying or leasing they work to gain your confidence to come back again for your next vehicle purchase. I went to return a lease ( 2012 Ford Edge ) and replaced it with a 2014 Lincoln MKX, and left with a Ford Fusion also . They made it easy and affordable to do so. Dana is definately my dealer of choice and would recomend any one to them.",5

2222,16-Mar-14,I had a great experience with Dana Ford.  Anthony went above and beyond to make sure I got the car I wanted at a price I could afford.  I never felt rushed or pressured from him even when I took awhile to choose a color.  He answered all my questions and took the time to set up the navigation and bluetooth and make sure I understood how everything worked before I left the dealership.  I would recommend to anyone to go to Dana Ford and see Anthony when looking for a car.,5
2223,25-Feb-14,"I've been leasing vehicles for 25 years now & Dana is always a great place to lease from…but I have to say that in all of my years leasing I have never met a more personable, knowledgeable, & friendly salesperson then Anthony Giagnacovo.

2228,11-Feb-14,"After dealing with those bozos over at Staten Island Nissan I was little reluctant about dealing with another car dealership on Staten Island. I finally got up the nerve and called Margie to set up an appointment(after canceling previous appointments) to come in. I entered the dealership and asked for Margie, Margie came out, greeted me warmly, introduced herself and told me she someone would be out to help me momentarily. A few minutes later, here comes Steven Conti, I liked him instantly. His easy manner put me at ease right away.I told him I was interested in leasing a Ford Explorer, he then proceeded to explain to me the difference between the different models. We then went outside, looked at different vehicles, i looked at several before I decided on the one I wanted. I went for a test drive and I was hooked!! We went back inside, so I could fill out the paperwork. Now here comes the hard part, waiting for the approval. The longer it took the more nervous I was getting but I played it cool. Joe Bogigian came over to me and introduced himself and assured me everything would be okay,  I am still waiting and then Stephen Riccardone, introduces himself and informs me he's the Finance Manager. I thought to myself uh-oh this can't be good. He explained to me he was still waiting for the bank approval. I wanted to jump out of my skin, but I remained cool. Finally the news I had been waiting for I was approved. I felt jumping up and clicking my heels but of course I didn't. I drove there in a 1998 Ford Explorer and was driving
out in a 2014!!!  To Margje, Stephen R, Steven C and Joe B, thanks for the outstanding customer service!!! You were all great..Dana Ford Rocks!!!",5
2230,03-Feb-14,"The reason we keep coming back to Dana Motors is because of Joe. He is friendly, professional and tries to make the car leasing process as easy as possible. Dana is lucky to have him in their employ",5
2231,01-Feb-14,"I've been a loyal customer to Ford since 1991 & have seen & dealt with many sales people. Today I went to take advantage of the early lease return program & met with the Sales Manager Joe Bogigian who I had scheduled an appointment a week earlier. Joe, prior to today's appointment had seen my record and realized that I've been a long standing & loyal customer and emediately greated me with a handshake and smile and said he was going to give me a great deal. He asked me what I wanted as far as car & lease payments and said ""I'm going to make it happen.""  He then introduced me as ""his friend"" to Shaunna Boreham & said to her we're going to take him out of that car & put him into a new one and pointed to the car in the showroom for the make & model of the fully loaded version of the car I was looking for. As Saunna was showing me the cars on the computer that were in the lot for me to test drive Joe came back to me and said it's all done, that fully loaded car and he met my lease payment demand. I for sure thought it was going to be way out of my range giving the fact it was fully loaded as well as the high ticket price on the window. It was the first time I didn't have to hagggle or fight to lower the price, payment, down payment or look at a lower end model to get even close to the payments I wanted. I emmediatly shook Joe & Shaunna's hand & the deal was done. They both thanked me for being such a loyal customer & boy did they show it.",5

Diane always has a smile on her face, addresses you by name, listens attentively, and sincerely tries to address your concern.  What a great person to have on the front line.

I explained what I was looking to do, and without hesitation we went looking at the cars in inventory.   I mentioned what features I wanted, the color of the car and found it immediately.   I was then brought into the sales area to complete my transaction.   I met with Steve regarding the finance part of the deal.  My experience went seamlessly and I left Dana with a new car.  ",5

We wanted to get the Ford Focus for our daughter and Sam and Joe worked with us to get us the car and the lease deal that we were happy with.
Buy or leasing a car is an overwhelming experience but they made it as easy as possible for us.  And I absolutely intend on coming back for our next car.

2248,29-Dec-13,I was not sold on ford being a Nissan customer for 10+ years. It was the service received from Anthony Giagnacovo who was extremely courteous and informative. Not to mention patient because my husband went on Thursday 12/26 and spent 4 hours with him. I returned on Friday 12/27 and bought the Ford Edge. My lease was up on 12/30 on my Murano and I was going to get their Pathfinder. I feel that its not the product that sold me but the service. ,5

2251,10-Dec-13,"Jeff Beyer, my salesman, was professional and easygoing. I hate going into a dealership and feeling pressured...none of that at Dana Ford/Lincoln.  Jeff asked what features we were looking for in a car, and when we told him, he directed us to a large selection of vehicles meeting our criteria.  We made a decision on the spot, test drove the car and made a deal..smooth transaction. He was extremely efficient, making sure that the paperwork was not overwhelming. He clearly explained each form I had to sign.  We are return customers at Dana and Joe Bogigian greeted us warmly.  When negotiating the price, I know he gave us the best deal possible.  He is a charming guy (NOT the fake, pour on the charm to make a sales, guy) who appreciates his customers.  I will definitely return to Dana for another vehicle.",5

Mike pointed out all the bells and whistles on the car and when I was ready, between Joe B, Mike and myself, we agreed on a price which I thought was very competitive. This is my fourth Lincoln I purchased/leased with Dana and these guys and I'm sure it will not be the last.",5

With Anthony's help and amazing customer service, he was able to get us into a Lincoln MKX, a car we didn't even think we can afford. We are so happy with our new luxury car thanks to him. We used Dana before, but this time is was different, we felt like we where dealing with family.",5
2256,01-Dec-13,"My experience at DANA is one to remember! This dealer was recommended by two friends. Both had a great experience like I did. I was welcomed as a long time friend, when I walked into DANA. I was just asking for prices on several explorers and was shown what they had in stock ,Anthony Giagnacovo sales consultant was very knowledgeable and was able to answer all my question regarding the explorers. Once i made up my mind on the explorer 2013 limited ,Juan Estrella sales manager and Anthony were very helpful on reaching a very fair price with me. I was just stopping by to get prices so I can continue shopping around,I kept telling them that ""I wasn't looking to buy today"" well that wasn't the case here! I feel their honestly and truthfulness really made the sale for me. After I decided to purchase this explorer I met with Mitch Bass Finance Manager very nice guy and very straight shooter, he explained all the terms of the loan and warranty of this vehicle just as he did on the phone. No extras, No surprises ,No BS. For these few reasons and many more too long to list , I a very very satisfied buying my 2013 limited explorer at DANA , I will recommend this dealer to everyone looking to purchase a new or used vehicle.  Anthony, Juan, & Mitch keep up the great job!!

2258,30-Nov-13,Working with Anthony again on our second purchase this year was again a great experience end to end. His knowledge of the vehicles and personal attention to every detail keeps us coming back.,5
2259,18-Nov-13,"I had been searching for a new Ford Mustang for sometime and recently bumped into Anthony at a couple of car functions.  I told him what I was looking for and to my surprise he assured me DANA Ford & Lincoln had exactly what I was looking for.  Being that I lived a couple states away, having what I was looking for was only half the battle, the price also had to be right.  Anthony not only gave me a price that destroyed the local dealerships, but with the help of Mitch, also beat my lender when it came to the financing.  On top of all of this, no crazy, made-up fees- $75 and that's it.  

I've dealt with plenty of dealerships in the past and believe me when I tell you, my experience with Anthony and DANA Ford & Lincoln was by far, the easiest and most enjoyable I've ever experienced.  I will be telling all of my friends and colleges in the market for a new or used car to definitely check out my friends at DANA, it was well worth the 2 hour train ride!  ",5

2274,16-Oct-13,"I had ordered a 2014 Shelby at another dealership and they were not able to deliver because they did not get the allocation for the car. Dana was one of the 5-6 dealerships within a 25 mile radius that still had one in stock. I saw it online, and really liked the color, so I sent an email via the website. I got an email response within several hours, and after I replied and confirming my genuine interest, I got a call from Anthony. We spoke for about 20 minutes, and I told him what was important to me regarding this transaction- specifically, the value of my trade, the financing rate, and my lack of desire to pay a premium over sticker for the car (which many dealerships were charging due to its rarity). Anthony was extremely knowledgeable about the car- even to the point of being able to answer technical/ mechanical questions with the aptitude of a master mechanic. He said he would call me back after having worked on my concerns. The next time we spoke, he let me know that he would be able to satisfy all my concerns, so we set up an appointment. I drove to the dealership- which is in Staten Island- arguably not the most scenic panorama on this side of the continent. The first thing that was notable, was the general look of the dealership- it was an old building- with ongoing construction in progress- presumably to expand the dealership, but the sales staff had a different look than what I had previously experienced in an American car dealership- they looked professional- almost corporate- none of the cheesy bad suits or gaudy exposed watches. The sales process is a long one- this is simply a given. As I sat there, i became aware of a steady stream of people walking in to buy cars- not just to shop or browse, but to actually buy. It was apparent that this was truly a high volume, succesful dealership. At this point, my memories of doing case studies while studying for my MBA started popping into my head, and my curiosity got the better of me- so I started asking some of that staff why they thought this dealership was so successful, given that it was certainly not attributable to the scenic location. They all had the same answer, ""We have been here 33 years, and get a lot of repeat business."" Personally, I have never wanted to walk back into the same dealership of any kind a second time, but this was somehow different- customers clearly felt comfortable enough with this staff that they knew they would not be intimidated or pressured into buying, and knew they would get a good deal. At the end of the day, I had a Shelby for the price I wanted, an excellent financing rate, and close to what I wanted for my trade (to be fair, there were some issues with the car of which I was not aware). This dealership is highly recommended by me.",5
2275,15-Oct-13,"Just picked up the car yesterday and so far have not had one bad experience either with the dealership or car. They were extremely helpful, listened to what I wanted and very thorough in explaining the differences in the cars. They did not pressure me at all, just gave all of the facts and figures and let us make the decision after leaving. I was extremely happy with Matt as my salesperson, very knowledgable and polite. Would definitely recommend this dealership without hesitation!!",5

Juan (manager) was very friendly and has a great personality - gave me a great deal on my new MKZ.  And finally in Finance, Steve was thorough and prepared, I walked into the finance office all the paperwork was prepared and the the numbers were the numbers I had agreed on!!

Overall a great buying experience,  I live in New Jersey and will definitely continue to have car car serviced at the Dana dealership!! ",5
2283,15-Sep-13,"First things first:  I did not need a car, as I was past the halfway mark on my loan on my current vehicle.  The vehicle I had was well taken care of and had no cosmetic or mechanical damage.  I was prepared to leave any dealership that could not give me an equal or better deal than what I already had.  That said, I did want a new car.

After stepping into several dealerships, the best deal I was offered was 50$ more a month for a vehicle comparable to my current vehicle, when my current vehicle was new.  I mentioned this to a friend and was told to go see Dana Ford.  Dana Ford is located an hour North of me, so I explained that I didn't want to take the hike just to have the same thing happen.  My friend was insistent that if they couldn't make me an acceptable offer, no one could.

I went to their website and picked out a vehicle.  I set up an appointment over the phone to come in the next day and have them make me an offer on my trade in, and for me to see the vehicle I wanted.  They confirmed the vehicle was on site, and I was advised to speak with Doug Hansen when I got there.

Upon arrival, I parked my vehicle in the lot.  As I got out, one of their salesman, Anthony Giagnacovo, was parking the vehicle I picked out.  He asked my name.  When I told him, he said, ""I think this is your vehicle, I just finished having it cleaned.""  He let me inspect the vehicle while he advised Doug of my arrival.  Anthony came back outside and led me into Doug's office.  Doug was incredibly friendly and most importantly, honest.  He took my key to my current vehicle so their appraiser could inspect it while we discussed the vehicle I was interested in.  The appraiser offered me three thousand more than the second highest offer I had been given for my vehicle, higher than the KBB value.  Within half an hour of my arrival, Doug made me an offer that absolutely shocked me.  I could not even hide the surprise on my face.  Negotiations ended right there and I agreed to the terms.  Anthony Giagnacovo took care of transferring my insurance to my new vehicle and the finance manager, Mitch Bass, handled all of the paperwork.  It all happened so fast.  Normally I don't mention specific names in a review, however these three individuals were the most knowledgeable, friendly, and honest employees I have ever seen at a car dealership.

When it was all said and done, from start to finish, the entire process was over in less than an hour and a half, and I had a new car (at a higher msrp than my trade-in's msrp) for significantly LESS than my current loan.  In the end I'm paying less money for more car.  I will only buy vehicles from here from now on, and I would recommend them to anyone.",5
2284,14-Sep-13,"My experience at Dana Ford Lincoln was hands down the best new car shopping experince i ever had. Anthony was a gentlemen and a plessure to make a deal with. I told him exactly what features I needed and where I'd like to be on price and he made it happen. He wasn't like most of the animals I've dealt with in the past, always trying to sell me extras i don't need. I most definitely recommend Dana/Ford and Anthony if you or anyone you know is in the market for a Ford or Lincoln. You would be foolish to go elsewhere. My friends told me to go to Dana before signing any paper work with other dealers because they will beat any rock bottoms that were on the table and they were no doubt right about that.",5
2285,28-Aug-13,"I to the dealership because Shaunna notified me that I could get out of my lease early.(She regularly called to see how my Edge was) I liked my Edge but thought it was a bit big for my needs. So, I was interested in what Ford had to offer. I told her I wanted a smaller vehicle with a lower payment and still wanted some to the nice features of the Edge. I leased an Escape and I am pleased. Shaunna is a very knowledgeable and effective salesperson. It was a pleasure to work with her.",5
2286,28-Aug-13,"Mike will remember his first sale for the rest of his life, he was very helpfull in this sale and went out of his way to meet my needs. Congrats Mike. I always buy ""new"" and after meeting an honorable man like Joe Bogigian (Manager) I will return to Dana in the future. After our financial discussion was concluded he made sure that all of my needs were met, and I feel confident that he will continue to meet any needs I will have in the future. After doing my homework on what I wanted and how much I was willing to pay, I was very pleased to drive away with a great bargan and left there a happy customer.    ",5
2287,20-Aug-13,Amazing describes it in 1 word..Im hooked on these guys and this dealership..that has to be the strangest thing to write about a dealership since its so rare. I always felt taken advantage of in other places..a woman going in alone..but not here! There was  a feeling of being taken care of and felt like family from the minute I walked in the door!

2295,02-Aug-13,"Great experience buying our car at Dana Ford Lincoln. Compared to other dealerships we visited, the service was top-notch. Anthony was friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable. He took us right to the cars we were interested in and didn't try to sell us on anything bigger or more expensive. Overall, it was a pleasurable and stress-free buying experience.",5
2297,23-Jul-13,"This is the second time I have dealt with Shaunna and she is one of the nicest things about Dana Ford/Lincoln , highly recommend dealing with her!",5
2298,22-Jul-13,"If it seems like I dealt with several DANA employees it is because they have a high-performance team culture there, which is quite impressive. They are extremely professional and what everyone wants, they offer competitive prices. I leased a 2013 Lincoln MKS and went to 3 other dealers first  none of which were a match for the team at DANA. My wife is a Vice President of a Fortune 500 company and she was impressed on how well we were treated, as well as how effortless the process was. Step 1) Called and told them what car I wanted, 2) they had it, 3) they offered me a great deal right out of the gate, 4) Test-drove it and went home with it. 

Thanks DANA! We will be back. Enjoy your new, well-deserved, showroom when it is completed. ",5
2299,22-Jul-13,"We had a great experience at Dana Ford.  We had done an extensive search in the boroughs for a Ford Escape and did not have very good luck because of the lack of inventory at other dealers.  At Dana Ford, they had A TON of inventory, so we were able to get exactly what we wanted (and even more) for a great price.  The people were great, Anthony was very down to earth, helpful, and let us test drive the exact car we wanted to buy.  The finance department (we dealt with Steve) was not pushy at all, and all around they were very helpful.  We had a very positive experience and will be recommending Dana Ford/Lincoln to our friends and family.  ",5
2301,17-Jul-13,"Our visit to Dana was the first in our process for shopping for a new Ford Edge.  Our first salesman to help was Kevin Ferger who took the time to answer all of our many questions and and then took us on our test drive.  He was very informed and knowledgable.  But, as we explained when we arrived, we were not buying that day and still needed to do more research.  A couple days later we did come back after trying to negotiate a deal using an online process and spoke with another salesman.  We later learned that if we bought a vehicle he wasn't going to be recognized as aiding in the sale but I told him he did a great job and I would make sure it was noted.  We then dealt with Juan Estrella and Tom Hansen.  Tom Hansen is a very personable young man....knowledgable and obviously very smart...but did not come off like a know it all, which sales people sometimes do and the consumer feels rather inadequate.  He has a very bright future ahead of him.  Juan was very helpful in negotiating the all important bottom line lease numbers.  My husband walked away happy, which is a very rare occurrence!  Steve Riccardone was also very personable and informative...a real pleasure to do business with him....no high pressure but gave us all the information needed for us to make informed decisions regarding additional service plans.  All and all..was very glad we went back and are more than happy with our purchase...2013 Ford Edge SEL!!

2308,29-Jun-13,Purchased a certifed used 11 Lincoln MKZ.  Efficient transaction.  Anthony worked with me to find the right car and went out of his way to help my wife test drive it since we have a 2 month old and getting out of the house is a challenge.  Car was meticulously detailed when I came to pick it up and Nouri had all of the paperwork ready.  My second purchase from Dana and well worth the 45 mile drive.,5
2310,21-Jun-13,"When we first went to Dana Ford, we had no intention on buying that day. We were purely there to look at a Ford Explorer that I had on ""hold"" at another dealership, and nothing more. Mike Passaro met us as we were walking up, and we told him the truth up front. From the start he was extremely courteous and helpful. He took us to the lot and showed us every single Explorer he had there (my son even held his hand!). Without question he let us take if for a ride and showed us everything about it. We told him what we were looking to do as far as a deal, he said he would beat the competitor's price - and he did! I have worked with a lot of brokers and dealerships over the years, and Mike is one of the BEST salesman that I have ever had the pleasure to deal with. Smart, Honest, and Courteous...he went above and beyond for us. If you're looking for an honest guy, who knows his stuff and works for the customer - Mike is the guy for you! I will recommend everyone we know to Mike Passaro at Dana Ford - Best of the Best!",5

2317,28-May-13,"On May 27, 2013 I accompanied my mother to this dealership in order for her to return her leased vehicle (other make/model) and to re-lease a vehicle from Dana. From the moment we walked in we were greeted right away by manager Juan Estrella. My mother expressed her concern that she wanted this to be a smooth transaction, as she has had many unpleasant experiences at other dealers. Juan called over his sales rep Matt Riccardone for immediate assistance. Matt spent as much time with us as needed to select the vehicle my mother wanted the most. He was personable, friendly, attentive and most of all, patient. What I really respected most was that Matt was not pushy. In my opinion he made everything about this experience wonderful. All the while, we noticed that Juan, the manager, kept his eyes on us each step up the way to make sure things were running smoothly. When it was time to see the finance manager, Nouri, this experience was similarly a wonderful one. I was so impressed as to how hard each one of these gentlemen worked, I stopped by the next day and also leased the same vehicle my mother purchased but in a different color. I just cant say enough about these three men!!!! Juan, Matt and Nouri it was truly a pleasure to do business with you. You will be HIGHLY recommended, I can promise you that.

Sincerely,
Diane M. Caso",5
2318,28-May-13,"This is my second purchase from Dana motors.  I had the pleasure of meeting Joe during my first purchase a little over two years ago.

He wasn't pushy or tried to coerce me buying right there and then. And because of his professionalism I came back the next day put a down payment on the vehicle which I'm currently driving. 

I had some issues with my credit and the finance manager Nouri Aktouf worked with me to resolve them and get me approved and into the vehicle.

Both of these gentlemen were professionals and I would definitely recommend going to DANA Ford Lincoln to see them if you're looking to buy/lease a new vehicle.  ",5
2366,23-Jan-13,"I was very pleased with everyone at Dana. I was just browsing & pricing trucks when I walked in, but I was so impressed with the knowledge the salesman had on the truck I was interested in, I figured why not, I was due for a newer truck anyway. The manager was very pleasant & he worked with me on the price of the vehicle that fit my budget. I made a decision in about an hour & I went back a few hours later with my husband to sign the papers & we took the truck home! Shopping for a new car can be very stressful, but the staff at Dana made it all so simple! I would highly recommend this dealership to anyone looking for a new car!",5
2367,23-Jan-13,"Mike made an extremely painful purchase less painful.
Curtious, friendly and very helpful. I'm hoping if and when
we need to deal with the service department we receive the same helpful attitude.",5

2370,21-Jan-13,Matt Riccardone provided us with exceptional service. He was extremely knowledgable about the new vehicle I wished to lease. He was very accommodating and patient. It was an absolute pleasure working with him. Usually I would dread going to a dealership and dealing with a sales consultant. Matt was very pleasant and went over how to operate my new vehicle and all the features. I will recommend him to family and friends.  Dave Diorio provided me with a deal I could not refuse. Thank you. Steve Riccardone handled our  paperwork and reviewed all finances clearly and quickly. He had us in and out. I received a follow up call from a manager by the name of Joe the next day. He thanked me for my purchase. I could not be happier leasing my Ford Escape from this dealership.,5
2373,15-Jan-13,"I was in the market for a USED car, and even though I did not buy from them, they tried to put me into a NEW car and did their best to work with my budget. They offered TREMENDOUS finance rates of 0% for 36 mos. .9% for 48 mos. &amp; 1.9% for 60mos. which is better than ANY bank. In the end, it was my choice to stay with a used vehicle, but they certainly tried hard to make a new vehicle possible. The Sales people were very nice and I would gladly recommend to any buyer to stop in.  ",5
2374,14-Jan-13,"Overall great experience, this is the 4th deal I've done with these guys and I'll be back again. Everything was handled very professionally, and quickly.

I would recommend this dealership to anyone looking for a great deal and excellent customer service.",5
2375,14-Jan-13,I have been using Ford for 15 years..Dana for the last 2 vehicles...this has been overall the best experience by far..John Daly and Mitch Bass did this sale without alot of nonsense and it was done so quick...it was a pleasure dealing with this team.....thank you!!!,5
2376,13-Jan-13,"Excellent customer service. Very professional sales team. Highly recommended dealership! very nice to deal with such knowledgeable sales team. Dana staff go the extra miles to make sure the customer is comfortable with your purchase, without any pressure to buy!",5
2377,12-Jan-13,"This dealership is phenomenal. At least from my experience. I already knew which car I wanted. They didn't have the car in stock because it was a dealer ordered car and was inbound. But securing the vehicle was smooth and easy. No one spoke to me like a salesman, very professional. So the car was secured and as soon as it got there they notified me, did inspection, detailed it and gave me a full tank of gas. To make everything sweet my salesman Dion offered to demonstrate different features on the vehicle. I think this is a good dealership to consult with if your looking for a relaxed no gimmick environment very professional. I didn't rate the price and this is only pertaining to my situation, because the price of the car was fair, and the mistake I made was not securing my own financing because due to. I just got off the phone with my father matter of fact so the statement about the financing is void. After some research I got hooked up with an outstanding lease, Mitch the finance manager explained the scenario to me, but because it was a lease that was my reservation about the situation, but the interest rate is lower then if I would have financed it so hooray again.",5
2379,09-Jan-13,Mike was a great salesman.  He helped me in every way possible.  He got me the price I was able to pay without any problems.,5
2380,07-Jan-13,"My overall experience was wonderful.  Mr. Edwards was patient, friendly and very informative.  Purchasing a vehicle with a toddler, can be difficult, but the staff was very helpful and made the experience quite pleasant.  Mr. Edwards is a great salesman and I will refer my friends to him.  ",5
2382,07-Jan-13,"Dana Ford and Lincoln is a great car dealership. Every person who worked there was very friendly and nice. When we walked in sales reps immediately came over to help us. It was a great feeling. The customer service was great. Joe and Roy did a great job of addressing all our questions and helping us get the car we wanted. They came to us as soon as we walked in. They have a great quality of work at Dana. Roy right away spoke to us about the cars. He didn't try and push one car on us but rather just asked what we were looking for. He was very knowledgeable and knew most things about the cars and if he didn't he found out for us. He was a pleasure to work with. We loved that he knew the models of the cars by looking at the tires. The price that we got a Dana was more than fair. One thing I always hate about car shopping is trying to haggle for a  good price. At Dana you don't need to argue prices they truly give you the best one they can. Over overall experience at Dana Ford and Lincoln was exceptional. Joe and Roy were the perfect people to work with. They were more than just car dealers. They treated us with respect and were very fair. I would recommend Dana Ford and Lincoln and Roy and Joe to anyone.

2385,04-Jan-13,"The saleman Mike Edwards was upfront and honest, he did not pressure us into buying or leasing any vehicle.  When it was time to discuss what we wanted to do and a price he explained all our options.  When we were undecided on what we wanted to do and the price being offered, he brought over his manager Joe Giaconia who better explained the pros and cons of leasing and negotiated a working/acceptable price for us to lease.  Five days after we leased and left my wife decided she wanted a remote starter input to the vehicle.  I went to Dana yesterday spoke to Joe Giaconia only because Mike Edwards was off, Joe set me up to have the remore started installed and it was was this morning ( the next day ).  I am very very satisfied with the service I have received so far.  ",5
2386,03-Jan-13,I couldn't be more pleased with my sales person Anthony.G he took the time to make sure all my questions and concerns were answered regarding my purchase of a new vehicle before and after.I would recommend Anthony.G to anyone looking to purchase a vehicle. ,5
2387,31-Dec-12,"Meeting Anthony was a pleasure. He was so sweet and helpful with all of my questions. I purchased a 2013 Ford Fusion Titanium from him. Mike Sauber and Anthony both did a great deal and were extremely knowledgeable about the car they were selling me. I really enjoyed purchasing from this salesman not only because he made me feel comfortable with his friendly appearance, but because he was great at doing his job and had a passion I have not seen in other car salesmen.

2388,29-Dec-12,"JohnDaly and Joseph Bogigian were very informative, friendly, and courteous also very patient with my very demanding husband. I highly recommend anyone looking to buy a vehicle to stop by Dana motors and deal with these kind gentlemen. We purchased a 2013ford edge! ",5

2393,27-Dec-12,"We were completely satisfied with all the help we were given from Shaunna.  She is very professional, courteous and friendly.  She made us feel extremely comfortable and this is why the rating above was given.  She went above and beyond in assisting us.  She even had to come in on her day off because that was the only day we could get in to pick up the two vehicles we were picking up.  One was a new lease and the other was a certified preowned that we purchased.  Just as a side note, we purchased a Lincoln MKS in July from Shaunna and unfortuantely it was destroyed in Hurricane Sandy along with a Mercedes we also owned.  So now that we needed to replace the two vehicles we knew there was no other place than Dana and no other sales assistant than Shaunna that we wanted to deal with.  It worked out great and I'm sure we will be back in the future and we will request Shaunna once again.  Thanks",5
2394,27-Dec-12,"All the above served us the best quality and I would like to emphasize my salesman Anthony Giagnacovo went above and beyond any salesman I have felt with in my years buying or leasing a new car and I'm 70 years young
He helped us in every aspect whether it was simple or not 
When we need a call back it happened promptly 
I was the first customer to need a spare tire with the hybrid cmax not a sealant air can because we travel and on the road if we get a blow out a tire is necessary
In my business the bride and groom have to have their video and photo people there
So he managed to get a tire ..see if it would fit sitting up and it did
Thank you

2395,27-Dec-12,"I am a victim of Super Storm Hurricane Sandy and lost all three of my vehicles. I went to Dana Ford with my son in order to replace my Pickup truck. Frank Dalonges was my salesman who took his time to show me all the different trucks that Dana had in their inventory. He was very friendly, down to earth and drove a F150 himself ( the same vehicle I was looking into). I felt no pressure and took up a lot of his time. I actually closed the dealership late two nights in a row. My next contact at Dana was the Sales Manager  Joe Bogigian who sat down with me and got me the best deal possible with all the rebates he could on the truck I finally purchased. He also went above and beyond for me with Ford Finance to get me the best rate due to credit rating. Steve Riccardone was my finance manager who went over every detail with me regarding my purchase. Jim Cognetta , the owner of the dealership, took time out to meet with me and offer his assistance with anything he could do.
  From the moment I walked in the door to the moment I drove out with my New 2013 F 150, I felt at ease and confident that I definitely came to the right place. Everyone at Dana Ford jumped through hoops to help me out and get me in my New Truck (which I Love). I can not Thank them enough for making it Great Experience especially after what Sandy has put me and my family through.

2398,23-Dec-12,"Shaunna was a wonderful salesperson. She assisted me in leasing not one but two 2012 Ford Edge Limiteds AWD. She was friendly and helpful throughout the process. She found me the exact cars we wanted, even though one was not currently in stock. She worked with me to find a reasonable price for both vehicles. She even went over all of the cars features inside and out before leaving the lot with our new vehicles. The car is great, drives nicely, is great on gas, and wonderful in the snow. We are looking forward to leasing two more Ford Edges when these leases are up, as well as looking into leasing a third vehicle, a Ford Fusion. We are looking forward to working with Shaunna again in the near future and would recommend her to anyone! ",5

Anthony knows his vehicles & knew exactly what we were looking for in a SUV. He had everything ready on time & made the experience of buying our first late model SUV very pleasant.  We bought a Ford Escape & are thrilled with it.  

The Ford Escape rides like a dream. I can't believe how easy & comfortable it steers. It is so nice to have a dependable SUV with all the conveniences that you didn't know you needed! It's beautiful!

2400,22-Dec-12,"As always, Joe Bogigian and the rest of TEAM DANA far surpassed our expectations. My family and I  wouldn't  even think of going anywhere else for all of our automotive needs. When we're  there,  Joe and his team have a way of making us feel like we're the only clients in the shop. It's nice to feel the  nostalgic warmth of good old American customer sales and service. From the minute Jeff Beyer greeted me at the door,assisted in choosing and test driving my new MKX to the minute I drove off the lot, I knew I did the right thing by going back to DANA . In 2013 / 2014 my children have DANA leases maturing and there's no question they'll be going back to see Joe, Dave, Jeff ,Tom and the rest of the team........... Sincerely TONY L

2402,20-Dec-12,"WELL DONE Dana Ford Team of Staten Island NY for your excellent buying experience!! I was in the market for a Certified Pre-Owned (CPO) Ford Explorer Sport Trac.  It was the last Saturday in September 2012....I found the ruck I wanted online and it was located at Dana Ford in Staten Island....I quickly called the dealership and asked about availability and also how long they would be open; well, since I was making the trip to Staten Island from Pennsylvania, it was pretty clear that I might not get to the delatership before closing time....but, NO PROBLEM! as the Customer Service Rep assured me they would be there to great me whenever I arrived...WOW!!  
After seeing the vehicle, and then test driving it, I was introduced to the Dana Ford Sales Manager, Joe Bogigian -- he was friendly, professional -- a true gentleman whose customer service focus makes you want to do business with him again and again!! (I'm in sales....so trust me, this guy cares about his customers!)
The overall the buying experience at Dana Ford was extremely easy and, to my delight, was as close to ""no-haggle"" as I believe one could get when buying a vehicle from a delareship.  With Joe Bogigian's assistance, and with the help from his the entire team there at Dana Ford, I was able to purchase the exact Certified Pre-Owned truck that I was looking for AND at what I believe to be a very fair price -- PLUS I was approved for the best financing offer available. 
But wait....it gets better:  The only way I could get there to the delaership to take delivery of my truck was via public transportation; so, I was able to get to NJ (via NJ Transit)....then, the Dana Ford Sales Team member Anthony was able to to pick me up at the Train Station in NJ and then drive me over to the Dana Ford dealership in Staten Island NY (about 10-15 minutes away) as part of the deal...no worries....WOW!! Dana Ford is all about 100% customer service!!!
I would recommend Joe Bogigian and the entire Team at Dana Ford of Staten Island NY to ANYONE looking to buy a new or used vehicle (don't worry where you live....I am living proof that they will take care of everything to get you into the vehicle you want and make you a happy customer!!!).
I hope this Review was helpful to you - you will be happy buying your next vehicle at Dana Ford Lincoln in Staten Island NY!!

first of all some of these ratings should be excellent not just great.  My experience at Dana Ford Motors was an  excellent one.   Everyone of the people who took care of me, from Dave Diorio, the sales manager to Jesse Cognetta the delivery consultant were just great.  Steve Riccardone the finance manager and Michael Marrone the Sales consultant were wonderful.   Mike went above and beyond to assist me.  I was having a remote start and back up sensors installed in 2 days and he even made plans to come to pick up my
car and return it to me.  Now that's what I call a sales person.  Please give them all a pat on the back for me.

He forced me to take a test drive, showed me my options, gave me alternatives and gave a fair price.

Rich has called me...emailed me several times to make sure we were happy and we knew how to take advantage of all the bells and whistles that the Edge has. As I told him, it is an amazing car, every day is a learning experience. A lot of fun to drive.

I can't say enough about Frank Curry who showed his expertise in the technical aspects of having my phone synced with my new car which at first I thought was a problem. Problem solved thanks to Dion and Frank. Upon taking delivery of my new Edge I found some damage to the right and left front door handles as well as having a good amount of water in the interior of the vehicle. Tony Donato assured me that the handles would be replaced (they have been ordered) and will detail the entire vehicle at my convenience (probably when I bring it in for the new door handles).

When you're treated kindly and with respect there's no doubt you will have return customers, and I'll be one of them. My budget was met without a big hassle or the feel of intimidation. Coming off a lease of another brand my attempt was to stay loyal to the other brand, but was treated so badly I left the other dealership with a bad taste in my mouth.

2466,01-Sep-12,"Let me tell you.....being that I sell technology I know how to thoroughly research anything I do wether it's work or pleasure related,
So you can imagine what I put into buying a new car.
I dealt with a lot of different manufacturers and salespeople none being anywhere near as knowledge,accommodating and friendly as Anthony G of Dana Ford in Staten Island.
He had the patience to stick with me throughout.
Unfortunately Anthony didn't get the sale as I lucked out and found a 2011 infinity with 0 mileage at a GREAT price.
I just needed to take the time to write this review so maybe Anthony
 will get a few sales out of it.

If you're looking for a Mustang then there's nobody else you should be talking to but Anthony G.
If I'm ever in the market again I'll hunt him down to be sure I know what I'm buying.

Unfortunately, our 2002 Ford needed a new engine and the cost was more than the value of vehicle so we decided to trade it in  and use the proceeds towards the purchase or a lease of a used Ford vehicle.  When we arrived at the dealership, we were greeted immediately by Roy Alston. He was very professional, attentive and extremely knowledgeable.  He understood our situation and answered all our questions and concerns regarding the options to either finance or lease a used or a new vehicle.  He showed us their extensive collection of Ford vehicles.  We were very impressed with their variety of models that tailored to every budget. Based on all of the the helpful information Mr. Alston provided to us, we decided to lease a 2013 Ford Edge instead of a used vehicle.  Thanks to Mr. Alston, we were able to lease a new car for the first time in our lives. Besides Mr. Alston, the entire staff at Dana Ford Lincoln Mercury were extremely helpful and professional.

Juan Estrella was our sales manager...and he worked out a great deal to get me into a late model Edge.

I was concerned about the dealer paying off my trade in a reasonable amount of time so I wouldn t have to make another payment. It was paid off in 8 days!!

Dana has restored my trust back into a car dealer..I think they are great and would buy again from them.

2514,24-Mar-12,"The ratings are 1-5 with Great being number 5. Great cannot begin to describe the experience we had at Dana Ford. It should be more like EXCEPTIONAL!FRom the moment you walk into Dana Ford, you are treated as a person. The staff is friendly, professional and very patient. They work diligently with you on a one-on-one basis. Our salesperson, Anthony Volpe, was absolutely fabulous. He is knowledgeable, friendly and professional, all in one. Words cannot express how I feel about this dealership, but if you are looking to buy a car, new or used, and want to be relaxed, (because we all know how stressful car-buying can be sometimes) Dana Lincoln Ford is the place to go. I can guarantee that you will be as satisfied as my son and I are!

2515,17-Mar-12,"It is our 4th time goin to DANA. It started with Juan Estrella earning our trust. He made the exp easy, hassle free, & fun!. He is now a sales mngr, as he should be. He put us in the hands of Shaunna Boreham. She also did all we asked, made the sale pleasant, despite some bumps (on our end) she worked w our schedule, price, and extras. I purchased a 2012 EDGE LIMITED for my wife, to replace our 2010. Juan made sure we were takin well care of. The finance dept was fast, and helped us w small details. We will prob be goin back for an MKS, as well as a new EDGE in 24mos!!. Jim Cognetta runs a seamless operation, and represents the brand very well. My 7 ur old son NICOLO loves his new car!.

2517,13-Mar-12,"I have been dealing with Dana Lincoln Ford for about 7 years now and have leased various vehicles from them. Each and every time, my experience with them is nothing less than fantastic. Doug Hansen does an exceptional job as well as Nori (finance) and Shauna (sales rep). I would recommend Dana to others at the drop of a hat. ",5
2518,04-Mar-12,"This is the second time we have come in to lease a ford everytime we dealt with Shaunna Boreham, we would never deal anyone else. She knows our needs and always made everything as easy as possible. I put any of my friends or relatives in her hands she really cares about her customers and does everything she can to make the experience as smoothe and carefree as possible, she is the best, especially when there are certain issues involved, she makes you feel confident eases your tensions. Shaunna is a gift and Dana dealership is lucky to have her.",5

2522,27-Feb-12,"My wife and I are from CT, (115 miles away). We had been looking for a used BMW x3 and located one at Dana on the internet. My initial contact was w/ Margie via email who was very helpful in answering my many questions and concerns being that there was a bit of a distance between us. Feeling comfortable we made an appointment. We arrived and were met by Margie and then introduced to Richard who showed us the car. After we test drove the vehicle my wife was not convinced this was a car for her. (note: this car was exceptional as advertised).
Since we were there we decided to look at a CPO Ford Edge. She drove a base model SE and loved it, from there we asked to see more w/ AWD and feature upgrades which Richard did without hesitation. Richard was curtious and respectful to our needs during this process. We finally decided on a CPO 2010 SEL AWD w/ 14,500 miles, (this car was exceptional as well).
During the above process we were introduced to Tony and Nouri to work out an agreement. As we pursued options on a few differant vehicles up until our final decision they were both 100% professional and helpful. They essentially bent over backwards to find us a deal that worked. 
At no time did we feel pressured into anything. Everyone at Dana was completely understanding of the time it took between vehicles for us to talk things over w/ each other and weight all options.
For everyone that assisted us during our visit to Dana we would rate all of you as a 5 star plus!! We recommend this dealer to anyone looking for a new or used car and a hassle free car buying experience! We would gladly drive 115 miles tomorrow to do it again!!!

2539,30-Dec-11,"My 2007 Mustang GT was having transmission issues one morning. I was only able to drive 15mph (DR1) and was very frustrated over the whole ordeal. I had called Dana Ford, because I had bought my car there and I was the right call. The next day I had my car towed over there and had finally met Joe Dunn in person. He was friendly and was very respectful. I received my car four days later and it was like I had just bought it. Mr. Dunn took the time to explain the problem as well as how it was fixed. He also told me his concerns involving some front end work that I need. I will definitely be bringing my car back for service.

Thank you,

2542,11-Dec-11,"I have wanted a Lincoln MKS for over 3 years and did attempt to lease one in 2008 but after speaking with several Lincoln dealerships I was financial discouraged and found it almost imposable to get all the valuable information I needed to help with my decision . Turns out I leased a 2008 Infiniti and with the 39 month lease about to mature in February 2012 I thought I would give it one more try and  attempt to lease the Lincoln MKS.  I contacted several dealerships but only after I called my local Dealership Dana Ford L.T.D. in Staten Island N.Y. did I know that there was a very good chance I could get the car I really wanted. Lucky for me I talked to a great very professional gentlemen Roy Alston. In over 40 years of buying cars he had to be the best car salesperson I have ever dealt with because not only was he very thorough and knowledgeable but within two hours I was out the door with my dream car and free of my Infiniti. He beat every price I had from the other dealerships and gave me no reason to dream anymore. Thanks Roy you are the best and you are backed by a great team of Managers like Juan and Financial consultants like Steve. Thank you all so much, it was truly a very pleasant and successful experience. See you all again in 39 months for my 2015 MKS…

2550,15-Nov-11,My husband and I walked into Dana Ford and were greeted warmly right away by Mr. Giacalone. He asked us what we were looking for what we wanted to spend and took us right out back to check out the cars. When he knew what we wanted he searched every fiesta on the lot until he found the perfect one for us. He walked us through the paperwork and what steps we would be taking. He crunched numbers until the figures were something we were satisfied with. He kept it painless and simple carefree and light. In the end he worked it out so we could drive our new car off the lot the same day. We are big Luigi fans in this house!!!!!,5
2551,15-Nov-11,"Very happy. I bought a new Explorer, my daughter a new Edge, my son a Mountaneer. The  only reason giving 5 out of 5s is no way to record sixes.

Joe called me right away to explain what was wrong with the vehicle and had the car ready for me to pick up in 1 day! I was amazed. I was on my way to go rent a vehicle at Enterprise and didn't have to because the service Dana provided was so quick. Joe was a true professional and was always courteous and polite when I called to ask questions. He explained everything in detail and was reassuring. As far as customer service goes, I would deal with Joe a million times over! I am glad that I can trust in someone for the safety of me and my newborn daughter...and do it with a smile and fast! ",5

2555,04-Nov-11,I had a very possitive experience. I was dealt with in a totaly professional and curtious manner. Mr. Curry was informative and answered all my questions with patience and thoroughness. I would definetly recommend the dealership to all.,5
2556,04-Nov-11,"I brought in my 2002 Taurus for an estimate on some servicing. Dana Ford was nice enough to run through each item and price up all the work. I decided to proceed with the most important item due to my budget. While waiting a few days for the car to be completed, I called another Ford service center, just to price shop. They quoted the same work for 30% less. When I picked up the car, I told the guys at the shop about what I learned, but also stated I agreed to the work and the price. Ford customer service called me as a follow up (which was refreshing). I also converyed my only complaint.. the work was a little pricey. Remember, I had already paid, and was not expecting anything to come of this. So, I was very surprised when I received a voicemail from the head of Dana Service, Rich Durgin. 

At this point, I realized that Dana, and Ford, were pretty serious about customer satisfaction. I called three other Ford dealer's service departments to quote the work. I wanted to ensure I had accurate quotes.

I finally spoke to Rich. I conveyed my incredible satisfaction with the work, and his staff. I also told him I had called a few other dealers just to make sure I wasn't completely off base. I also confirmed with him that I paid what I had agreed to, and was not expecting all this hoopla. 

Rich explained how important complete customer satisfaction is, so he reviewed my invoice and proceeded to offer to fix another item on the list on him. 

I was stunned. 

Dana proceeded to replace both front brakes (with he better pads and rotors) and installed a new horn. 

Dealer service centers had come to get a bad rap. I am here to tell you to not believe the hype. Dana Ford of Staten Island, their service team, and Rich Durgin are serious about ensuring that everyone leaves completely satisfied. And, in my case, he has gained another loyal customer.

2558,31-Oct-11,"I just got a new car (the 2012 Mustang) at Dana Ford Lincoln Dealership in Staten Island, NY.  Prior to this dealership, I went to a couple ford dealerships but I end up sealing the deal at Dana Ford Lincoln.  Customer service was awesome.  They helped me get the car that I wanted and get rid of my old 2007 VW Jetta.  So I end up driving a new car that same day.  Everyone was friendly, and I felt comfortable dealing with everyone at the dealer.  I didn't feel pressured or anything.  Overall experience with the dealer was outstanding.  In addition, they had way more mustangs on the lot than the previous dealerships I went to so I had more mustangs to choose from.  

Roy Alston was the person that mainly helped me from the beginning to end.  Not only did he worked on lowering my monthly payments but he also assisted me in ordering and getting the parts that I needed after and he hooked it up!  So, I couldn't be more thankful to this dealership, to Roy, and the others (the sales manager, Dave; and the finance manager, Joe).  Bottom-line, Roy worked hard for me to get the car that I wanted so I wouldn't have to work any harder to keep up with my monthly payments. =]",5
2560,28-Oct-11,Went to purchase a new car was unsure of what I wanted and how much I wanted to pay.  Roy Alston took his time to sit with me and find a car that was just right for me.  What I loved is that he made sure that it was within my budget too (not just concerned about his sale).  I have had the car for over a month now and so far Roy has called me several times to make sure everything is going smoothly.  He also let me know that I could come in at anytime to sit with him so he could go over all of the truck's features again just incase I needed to.  Just ask for Roy when you go it was a pleasure doing busy with him.,5
2562,24-Oct-11,I bought a used car for my 17 year old son. Bob was very knowledgeable and directed us to the perfect car for him.  I went back 2days later and leased myself my 4th Lincoln.

Both Dave and Bob were great.,5
2563,24-Oct-11,"Joe Dunn in the Service Dept. made my first visit a very pleasant one. Clearly cares about his customers.  When it was determined that a part needed to be ordered and the part would take a few days to arrive, he saw to it that I got a loaner car. Joe Dunn is a great example of CUSTOMER SERVICE.",5

They worked very hard to get the car ""Edge"" in the price range we needed.
As mentioned above, I have dealt with Dave for many years and will continue with Tony and Dave hopefully for many years to com.

2569,17-Oct-11,"This is my second leased Lincoln Car with Dana. I came back to this dealer because the first time that I have to deal with Joe Bogigian he gave me the best price. I went to other dealers and they gave me the run around. This time after I test drive the car, Joe gave me a deal within 15 minutes. I came back at the end of the week to pick up the car with no problems. Everything was delivery to me the way we agreed in prior days. The transition was very smooth and no problems. Other dealers they promised you the world and when you come back to sign the documents they give you something else that was not part of the original agreement. Mike Price was the salesman and he was very nice and helpful and knew the car very well. Frank Curry was the final person that delivery the car and took his time to explain all the options that I have with the new 2012 MKX. This is a beautiful car and blows away the Mercedes Benz ML350. The new MKX is an intelligent car and it does everything for you with the voice commands. Overall, I will recomend this dealer with the following employees:

Joe Bogigian, Frank Curry and Mike Price EXCELLENT SALESMAN!

I wanted to let you know that this is also the second time I have dealt with Roy Alston, salesperson, at Dana Ford.  I am so happy he is working at Dana Ford. Just like the first time I was there and leased my Ford Edge, once again Roy Alston was excellent and provided the best service and helped me out from beginning to end.  Efficient, knowledgeable, kind, patient, are a few words to describe Roy.  Previous dealerships in the past did not provide me with as good service as Roy  has done for me with my two leases at Dana Ford.

I hope this e-mail will get to the right person to have Roy complimented and/or rewarded for his good work and putting a smile on my face once again.  I am happy to say that when this lease is up, that I will look forward to dealing with Roy Alston again.

2594,20-Sep-11,"I have purchased or leased many vehicles over the years, and in most cases, it was a very painful process - not knowing the numbers, someone going behind a ""curtain"" to get approval for a deal.. not the case here.

The dealership is open, the sales staff is pleasant and while knowledgeable about their product, they are not pushy. They didn't badmouth other products, only the virtues of theirs. 

The price was very fair, and the whole process - from test drive to delivery was 2 hours.  

The walk through of the vehicle was comprehensive, and they answered any questions I had.

I would recommend the Dealership to my friends without hesitation.

Regards
Tom ",5

There was no sales people available, but the sales manager Tony came out from behind the desk to help me personally. He is the manager, and did not have to take the time to walk me around the lot and show me the service department, but he made me feel like my time was important even though I was not ready to buy.

I would HIGHLY recommend anyone looking to buy a car to visit Dana.  I was at another dealership just the day before with my daughter who bought a car and the difference was like night and day!  My daughter is so sorry she did not visit Dana before she made a decision.  The dealership she dealt with was a Honda dealer and they used every manipulative trick in the book on her.

Anthony made my experience a wonderful one from the moment we met. Tony Donato worked with us regarding pricing. I gave him our budget and he made it happen. I originally went to the dealership looking at something totally different than what I came home with based on these individual's guidance. It was truly a great experience and I can't say enough positive things about these guys or the dealership! ",5

He knew everything about Mustangs and even races them with a Ford sponsorship. Can it get any better?! He answered all my questions and followed up after the sale. A funny and very professional guy. I doubt anyone knows more about the inner-working of this car than Anthony. High praise, for sure.

Mitch Bass also helped with the sale and did such a great job with the deal. A very fair and honest man. Rare traits in this industry ; ) He made all the paper work go smoothly and made sure I understood all the fine print. A true capable professional. 

In short, my experience with Dana was first-rate.

If you buy a Ford in the NYC area, this is your place.

All best,

2626,26-Jul-11,"From the moment we (my parents and I) walked in, we were treated with courtesy, respect, and dignity. My parents are older, and in today's society, they are often dismissed and ignored. They were unsure whether to lease a truck or a car. They got to examine both, ask questions about both, and take both for a test drive. Our salesman, Vinny, was patient at all times, answering any and all questions. Once my parents decided on the truck, Joe B. helped them to secure a great deal well within their budgetary needs. When Lou was reviewing the financing, he spoke slowly and clearly and repeated anything necessary. When we received the car, Vinny took the time to go over the car and explain everything. He also synched my mom's phone for her. All three men reassured my parents repeatedly that if they had any questions in the future, they should call or stop in, as they wanted them to continue to be satisfied. When we were completely done with the transaction, my parents were smiling from ear to ear. We were at the dealership for 5 hours.

The truck never showed up,after several phone calls i finally got the salesman on the phone,he said there was a little problem,no big deal,and that him or his Manager would call me back with a solution ASAP.they never called back, they would'nt take my call,and by the time i was on my way there,the principles were gone for the day.the next day some other Manager called, he had lots of solution's,not one even remotly resembling the deal i had agreed on, and others which just bordered on ridiculous.I at that point,totally frustrated called an old friend,and salesman himself that i had recently brought a commercial truck from for my business,Tony Marcario,who told me to come to Dana Ford, and assured me they would work it all out,and to relax..I went in on monday,frank the salesman,Tony,there manager Tony m.and Nouri in fiance,gave me there undivided attention,they told me to go pick out a truck,they had incredable inventory,and within a couple of hours,i had the deal I wanted,and am driving a brand new  Explorer,and couldnt be more satisfified..you'd be nuts to shop anywhere else,thanks again Dana,a customer for life,sincerely, ",5

I was so glad that there is someone that could help me in my language. They both were friendly and helped me with the batery. They told me that I have to change some cables. Next month I will change them. They asked me if I had to go somewhere, so they could take me there and pick me up again when my car was ready. It was nice of them. I just went to eat and Mr. Danny called me that my car was ready. The price were good, not too expencive... and I didn't have any more problem. I'm very happy with the service and the staff. I always tell my friends that speak spanish that there is someone at Dana that always help us in our language. Vinny and Danny, keep doing a good job, they must be happy having you two there. Thank you Dana for the great price and great service. ",5
2758,18-Aug-10,"     My experience at Dana Motors was, as always, an excellent one.  It is what I have come to expect from the people that work there.  This time Luigi Giacalone guided my husband and I through not one, but TWO, new car deals. He was professional yet friendly and made everything go smoothly.  We could not have been happier with the way he took care of our needs.  Also, we benefitted greatly from the expertise of Eddie in the area of our new navigation systems, synch technology and all the bells and whistles that came with our new vehicles.  He went over everything in a clear and patient manner until he was sure we were familiar with the features.  When the time comes for another car purchase, I feel strongly that we will go back to Dana Motors Staten Island NY. ",5
2760,15-Aug-10,"Joe Bogigian, Sales Manager and Steven Nilsen, Sales Consultant for Dana Ford Lincoln Mercury were both very professional and courteous while I was searching for the vehicle I wanted.  They both went above and beyond, to not only get me the vehicle I wanted, but to get a better vehicle which accomdated my budget.  I will refer friends and family members to Dana.  Thank you for a great experience.",5
2761,12-Aug-10,"I went into Dana Ford looking for a Mustang and was pleasantly surprised by the professionalism and knowledge that Anthony G. has with the current and past model Mustangs.  His overall friendliness, patience for my every question and expertise in stock and modded cars was the driving factor on my purchase......did i forget to mention also the great price i received.  i highly recommend Anthony G. at Dana Ford.",5
2762,10-Aug-10,"The service i experienced in Dana was very pleasant. Lou the manager went out of his way to get me into the car i wanted, steve and Joanna the two sales people i dealt with had a lot of knowledge on the cars i was inquiring  about ( which is not always the case) I never had such a smooth experience leasing a car before so Dana has me as a customer for life!

2763,08-Aug-10,This is my 7th car that I leased from this dealership.  Juan has been a rock for my families leasing needs. I love them and can't seem to break away.  I feel like part of the family!  I highly recommend Dana. I'm in love with my new Lincoln MKZ. It's perfect.,5
2764,07-Aug-10,"The attention the sales manager and financial manager gave me was great. They listened to what I needed and delivered.
The car was ready to be picked up when they said. Tom Hansen was great delivering the car to me. He explained every detail of the car inside and out. He set up the Sync system for me and explained how to program it myself at home on the internet.
Overall this experience was great. I would recommend y friends to this dealership.",5

2766,07-Aug-10,"My lease was up on my car, so I stopped by to look at some of my options and ended up driving home in a new car. Tom and the staff at Dana were very friendly and accomodating, especially when it came down to the price.  I didn't feel pressured all during any part of the process and even though it took some time for me to pick a car (because they had so many) and make a decision, they were very patient. I am very happy with my new mariner!",5
2767,07-Aug-10,"    To whom it may concern, 

              I would like to let you know that the sales staff at Dana Lincoln Ford  were the most pleasant,knowlegable,and caring sales staff I have ever worked with.Starting with sales mgr. Joe Bogigian who I now consider my close friend,then Juan Estrella finance mgr. who is actually already a good friend for many years,and lastly Anthony Giagnavacovo who knew everything about my new F150 Raptor and taught me well about the vehicles many potions. The three people I just mentioned should be commended by the owner for their great work. I know a lot of people and have already sent one of my best friends their,by the way he purchased a 2011 focus,and again these men rose to the occassion.I know because of how I was treated my decision to send people there as well as any future business of my own will be done at Dana with that trio of sales and service experts.

2769,06-Aug-10,"A good old fashioned dealer!
Honest and reliable.

I received no pressure to buy from the sales person Ron, the price was the best around, and what they promised me before the sale, is what I receive after the sale
Ron is knowledgable of their products.",5
2771,06-Aug-10,"I brought my 2010 Ford Transit into Dana last week to be serviced for its recall for break light leaks and head liner pins as well an oil change. I dealt with two advisors that day; Vinny when I initially brought the truck in and Danny when came back to pick it up. This is my work vehicle that I brought in and I explained when I came in that I needed the vehicle back promply, Vinny told me that it would be done as quickly as he is able to. In the time my truck was being serviced I recieved phone calls from Vinny and Danny informing me of the status of my car as well as other issues that needed to be addressed with my vehicle which was very suprising to me since I have been to other dealships with my work vehicles as well as my personal car and good luck getting someone to return a call to you let alone having the vehicle done that same day. I was very suprised when I revieced a call from Danny telling me my truck was ready by mid day and I was able to come in and pick it up, that is something that has never happened to me in the past with other dealerships and my car was usually held up in the shop no shorter then 2 days. I have recommended Dana to my other co-workers and friends to bring their vehicles serviced.",5
2772,06-Aug-10,"I have been to a few Ford dealerships for service for my 2008 Edge, but I would not bring my car to any other dealership except Dana Ford. I had a very pleasant and easy experience which I had not had at other dealerships.  The service was great, my adviser Vinny was very friendly and personable, he helped me out greatly in explaining why my car needed the certain repairs as well as going over the costs before my car began its repair. When I returned to pick my car up Vinny again went over my car and the repair that was done as well as informing me of repairs and services that I would need. Overall I had a great experience at Ford and with my adviser that I would have no doubt in my mind in bringing my car back again for any other future services.

2773,06-Aug-10,Frank Deo and his parts department are second to none. I have owned my auto body shop for thirty plus years and have followed Mr. Deo for over fifteen of those years. He is like a walking Ford encyclopedia. I also used Mr. Deo to check on my local store when I cannot get proper answers locally. ,5
2775,05-Aug-10,"I was very impressed on how swiftly I went in. got a deal, and purchased the car in two days. Everyone was friendly and professional. The salesman were not pushy and did not play the "" I got to talk to my manager 10 times"" before you get an answer. I recommend them highly.",5
2776,05-Aug-10,"Great dealership, very friendly, courteous, and got a great deal.Didnt know much about the vehicle when i first walked in to the store and by the time i walked out i knew everything about it that there is to know.

I was always given ample time to consider their offers with no selling pressure. ",5
2778,05-Aug-10,"My most resent business transaction with Dana was the lease of a 2010 Ford F-150 Harley Truck. Gema was my sales person and she did a great job. She was always at my disposal and worked very hard to get me into the exact vehicle that I wanted. I have been doing business with Dana since 2003 and this is my 5th vehicle that I have leased or purchased from them personally. I have also brought many members of my family, friends and business associates to Dana because I am always very satisfied and feel very comfortable doing business with them. Dave Diorio has been with them a very long time and always goes out of his way to help me with selection and financing. I would recommend this team of professional to anyone shopping for a Ford or Lincoln, both of which I have gotten here.",5
2779,05-Aug-10,"I have been dealing with Dana for about fifteen years and I would not shop at any other Ford, Lincoln or Mercury dealer.

2783,22-May-10,"I contacted this dealership via email for information on a Ford Fusion. I received a response within 10 minutes.  When i arrived at Dana I was warmly welcomed by the staff and treated like a V.I.P.  Although i had never purchased a car there before, I was treated like a long-time customer.  I found that they had more inventory than any of the other dealerships i had visited.  The test drive was very informative and I learned much more about the Fusion than any other dealer had told me.  The price i paid for my Fusion was very competitive and fair and i took it hone the same day!  I found the staff - from the Internet Department, my salesperson, the sales manager and the finance department - to be informative, helpful and easy to deal with.  I would highly recommend this dealership and will recommend it to my friends and family.  ",5
2784,21-May-10,"I bought a 2010 Ford Edge from Steven today and my experience couldn't have been better! I went online to find the car I wanted and someone promptly called me back and scheduled time for me to come in and test drive the car. I was greeted at the door and in my opinion, given an excellent price.  The manager Lou worked with Steve to get me a great monthly payment, and they even scheduled my 1st oil change for me so I don't have to worry about it when the time comes. I would recommend this dealership to anyone who knows the stress involved in buying a car because they managed to make it stress free for me!",5
2785,11-Apr-10,"My experience at the dealership was wonderful. My sales representative was very knowledgeable. The process went by really fast and I had my new car the same day. I couldn't ask for anything more! 
David was very helpful too. They both worked hard to get me the equiptment i wanted and the price i wanted to. I am defentially going to recommend this dealership to all my friends in the future.",5
2786,05-Apr-10,"wow, a lot of nut-jobs posting here! I had a great experience at Dana. I leased my new MKX from anthony and glen. I found the exact one i was looking for on their lot. They have a HUGE lot! The payment was $40 cheaper than the guys over the bridge and they didn't go back and forth with the price. The only thing that dissapointed me was the wait, the showroom was packed with people and we had to wait for a salesperson to become available. Once we met anthony he helped us find the car quickly and WE DROVE IT HOME THE SAME DAY!!! I can understand the frustrations of some people posting here, but to use the F word in their reviews and to defecate on this website just makes me think that they are nut-jobs. Me and my wife would certainly lease from Dana again, great experience. thanks",5

2795,21-Mar-09,"I was extremely happy with my experiences at Dana Motors.  I recently purchased a new Mercury Mariner, and am thrilled with the decision.  The young salesman who assisted me, Tom, was charming and well-informed.  He had my best interests at heart, and did not try to rush me through the car-buying process.  I appreciated how all of the sales staff took the time to answer my questions, and especially appreciated the reasonable price they helped me work towards getting so I could get the car I wanted.  I would definitely recommend this dealership to anyone!",5
