       " ' i was swindled into.a car lease that i can’t afford.\\r\\n\\r\\nmy ten year old car was experiencing transmission problems and before i was stranded with no car i decided to trade it in for a 2015 subaru forester for $17000. after the car was delivered to me and my old car was driven away i noticed that the rear hatchback for the trunk was a manual open. this posed a serious problem for me and a deal breaker since i’m disabled and lifting it is very difficult for me.\\r\\n\\r\\nafter some serious thought after six weeks with the forester i decided to trade it in for something more practical for my needs and also receive some of my money back in a trade. i was also uncomfortable spending so much money on a vehicle. so i started researching cars under $10000. \\r\\ni came across a 2007 nissan altima at dana ford here on staten island which was on wednesday may 30 2018.\\r\\n\\r\\ni went to the dealership on wednesday may 30 to test drive the altima which i wasn’t so thrilled with. before i knew it i was in the showroom and they’re showing me a brand new ford fusion, and i kept telling them i can’t afford $27000 if i’m not comfortable with spending $17000 on the subaru.\\r\\nafter much cajoling by the salespeople before i knew it i left with a brand new car that i couldn’t afford. they kept insisting everything would be ok.\\r\\noh, it will be fine!” she said. “we’ll work with you”said another salesperson. “it will be great!” naile said.\\r\\nwell it’s not great for anyone other than the person who received the commission. \\r\\nthis is going to put me in financial ruin!!!!!!\\r\\n\\r\\nthe next day i called them to speak with the manager because i can’t afford this vehicle. he wasn’t in and i was told by the salesperson, naile telic that he would call me friday when he was in. well of course no one called and i called in the afternoon to find out what was going on. this conversation with another manager named juan led to a shouting match. i called again later in the day and reached juan again who also insisted everything will be find after telling him again and again that i can’t afford it.\\r\\n\\r\\nnow its saturday june 2 so i decided to go straight to the dealership to straighten this out. i met with yet another unnamed manager who threatened to call the police on me after telling him that i can not afford this car. another manager came and took me to the dealerships supervisor in which after about a half hour he told me there’s nothing that can be done and i’m stuck with the car. he gave me another 15.000 miles a year and i still don’t have that in writing!! \\r\\nhe also suggested that i can afford $200 a month to pay off the lease. the fact is, i receive $1200 a month in disability benefits. living on that is difficult enough. how thoughtless and cruel it is to even think of that for anyone!!!\\r\\n\\r\\nthey used my forester as a three year “downpayment” and after three years will be financing the remainder of approximately $13000.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe issue is in three years i will be 63 and not finically able to pay off a loan and in no position to do so now either. as i stated previously i am disabled and receive a fixed income of $1200 a month and will not be able to afford to make payments of any kind. so after three years i will not only not have a vehicle but out of all the money i needed returned to me from the forester to buy something much more affordable.\\r\\n\\r\\noh, it will be fine!” she said. “we’ll work with you”said another salesperson. “it will be great!” naile said.\\r\\nwell it’s not great for anyone other than the person who received the commission. \\r\\nthis is going to put me in financial ruin!!\\r\\nnot once were my needs considered.. that the fact that i’m disabled and receiving disability of $1200 a month! that at the age of 63 i’ll have car payments? i honestly don’t know what i’m going to do!\\r\\n\\r\\nthey refused to take the car back even though i called the next day to do so!! who does this to a disabled senior citizen!!\\r\\n\\r\\nnaile telic you repeatedly asked me for a review, here it is! and thank you for acknowledging any of the emails i sent you in which you completely ignored.\\r\\n\\r\\ndana ford and it’s employees have left me no choice but to submit a complaint with the better business bureau and as of monday june 25 2018 i will be contacting the staten island advance. if i get no satisfaction from that i will contact the new york times and every local television news to resolve this.\\r\\n\\r\\ni can not afford this. i want to return the car asap. i need my money back!!!!!',\n",

(later i found out that they ran my credit report 10 times completely hurting that part of my score).   \\r\\n10 minutes later the finance person comes back and says that if i go with the usaa method, i won\\'t be able to buy the car today.   i found this really absurd and told him \"fine, i guess your dealership is the only dealership that has this dilemma\" and i prepared my stuff to depart.  a finance manager quickly found me and said that \"yes\" they can do the usaa method.   i then stayed in the bullpen area for another 2 hours straight with no one even checking on me.  no tv in that area...just tables and chairs where i got to hear salesman talk to other customers about their private stuff, a dana salesman complain to another salesman for about 20 minutes on the fact that he wasn\\'t doing anything that day because he heard he was going to get fired anyway....at this point i decided to go get something to eat since it didn\\'t look like they were going to get to me any time soon, so i packed up my things to go eat...in which a salesman came running after me when i made it outside and told me \"they had been looking for me because i was next\"...yeah right.   i could then go on to add they stupidity that followed based off the insurance that i had already switched over....but why bother.\\r\\nso here is the rest of the story.   they never properly submitted my paperwork, sent me the title.  i now have the truck, the title, but nooooo loan.   i found this out when i tried to pay the loan that doesn\\'t exist.  so on the 26th of december i called to have this rectified.   i called the first time, no one called me back.  i called the second time, got ahold of a sales manager who was suprised by the situation, and was going to get back to me quickly.  two hours later, i called back because i hadn\\'t heard anything.  the receptionist told me that the same sales manager said he knows about the problem and will call me back.  it is now the 15th of january...and i have still not recieved a phone call.  are you kidding me!!!!\\r\\n',\n",

       " 'i have waited almost 7 weeks to write this review because of issues that i had and still have it with my 2012 f150 3.5 platinum. my hell started during the purchase process, dana ford in staten island did a great job to make my life miserable during this whole process. i purchased my truck on friday and i made my decision based on reviews found on the internet about the f150, i tried a couple dealers before the purchase and finally made a decision to get it at this dealer because i found the one i wanted there. during the purchase process we reached an agreement and the truck was delivered to me with out the proper delivery process, the salesman and managers kept telling me several times about filling out this survey ok or excellent for them. i received very little information about the truck; they didn’t explain all the truck features or worse the specifics about it. when i got home the first thing i found out was the truck was larger than the one i traded in (toyota tundra limited) and i couldn’t close my garage and got very upset because i found out that night that this one was longer than my previous truck, i felt it during the ride from the dealer in new york to my house in new jersey. very unhappy about it i made my own internet research and found out the truck comes in different sizes like 145” and 157” long and comparing to my old one i needed the 145”. when you spend a lot of money on a car, you want to get what you paid for and you want to get what you want and the truck that makes you happy, this wasn’t the case for me with this truck because it felt longer and it wasn’t the one i wanted. i made the wrong decision to go back to the dealer and get the truck i wanted, the 145” that’s the truck size i been driving the last 5 years for almost every day. back at the dealer with 54 miles on the truck odometer, the salesman and the sales manager, first thing they did is to look for a way to take advantage of the situation and tried to get more money from me. after i checked others f150s with different specifics and one with a lower price of about $ 1,200.00, they proposed to me to sell me the new one and trade the one i got the day before with 54 miles on the odometer and pay them on top 2,800.00 to get the 145” size truck. i got very upset because in the way they wanted to do business with the newer truck they were clearly taking advantage and telling me in my face that i was stupid, that’s how i felt and that’s how i still feel.\\r\\nafter all discussions making the deal, which in the first place i thought they would just exchange the truck for me and any money difference will be paid either by me or by them depending on lower or higher price of the new one. they sold me the $ 1,200.00 lower price truck at the same price for my first purchase, so i knew i was loosing that money, having me in a place that i didn’t know what to do with a truck i didn’t want, i accepted to buy the 2nd. truck, very, very unhappy i signed the papers and drove home with the other one. they did the same thing with the second truck, gave me a pre-filled delivery truck sheet with all the options crossed out saying the truck is ok, repeatedly saying to me “to make sure when i get the survey i should fill it with all excellent for them because depending on that survey will be the salesman’s payment “. when receiving the truck i found the leather of the console top in the truck was scratched and asked the salesman to be addressed at what he immediately responded they will order a new cover and replace it, the salesman brought his customer relations manager to take a look at it, then he affirmed that they will put a new piece on and they will call me to schedule it.\\r\\nwaiting for almost a week i made a decision to call the dealer and ask for the console cover and also talk to them about what i found on the truck tailgate. the platinum f150 tailgate cover was coming off on one corner, i spoke to the salesman and the first thing he answered to me after listening to my complain about the tailgate is saying “ that is your responsibility because the truck has been with you for almost 1 week”, unfortunately not the best professional answer for a customer. anyway i made an appointment to bring the truck to the dealer to check it, but before my appointment the truck steering wheel column started to make a grinding noise, a clear sign that something is wrong with it. i came to the dealer and spoke to the salesman about it, they were not happy that i was complaining and bringing something new to the table. a technician checked the truck and agreed that something is wrong with the steering wheel column but proceeded to tell me that i should wait a little longer and see if the noise goes away and that they will check it again on the day my truck will be on service for the console top and tailgate cover. made an appointment for the following week to change the top of the console, fix the tailgate cover and check the steering wheel column again. basically they gave a very hard time to fix my truck, they never called back when they said they would, they wanted to do touch up work on everything since day one, wanted to buff up my console cover, they patched tape the tailgate cover and they didn’t want to fix the steering wheel column they told me that i should have some tolerance on this issues because every truck and car always will have some imperfections. after many calls to ford customer relations team i had the luck to talk to some people who helped me one way or the other, cynthia mcgregor helped a lot and i thanked her, but sometimes even for her this problem got very difficult. after all this complaining, they finally changed the console cover, they replaced the steering wheel column but during this work in the shop they scratched the 2 covers of the steering wheel base, scratched my truck left mirror and front bumper. lastly this last week i had to insist and try to get my registration and plates ready because i been asking all these passed 5 weeks but they didn’t have my name on file either, that’s what the ladies at that department said to me when they were asked for my papers and plates from me. it took almost 6 weeks and my calls to cynthia (manager from customer relations team), for them to get it ready but i have argued many times before with kendra and the other authorities at the dealer to get my truck registration and plates ready. she even hung up on me on the phone once because they couldn’t keep their promises to have the registration and plates ready at the day they said it would be ready.\\r\\nlast week i brought my truck to have the steering wheel cups replaced because they scratched it when replacing the steering wheel column, they also replaced the tailgate cover and sucked at it, they installed the new one incorrectly because now i have the same issue on the opposite side of the tailgate cover (left side). lastly one of the sales manager had the audacity to come to me and confront me asking “why i have given them a bad survey, because the only thing he had done for me was help ” that shocked me because i wouldn’t expect that from a manager (i found out his name is juan and he speaks spanish, i don’t know his last name) because he would be the right person to know what their errors and mistakes were with me when purchasing the truck and with the dealer customer service.\\r\\nmy truck tailgate still looks awful with factory quality control issues, but one thing i’m sure is that never, never in my life will i go back to this dealer and buy a car from them. because for me to go through this hell, it has been a huge nightmare and i don’t want anybody to pass it, i have been aggravated more than too many times during all this process, they disrespected me not doing/fixing things on time and in a professional manner what they had to do in the first place. they didn’t try to do what they promised to do, of course they did something but they did it because cynthia and myself had to be there to push them to do it.\\r\\njust to let you know how un-professional they are i’m going to let you know that this weekend when having my truck washed at the carwash when the truck was getting dried, the tailgate rear ford emblem fell off, at this point i didn’t know if i should scream, cry or just pray to god for better days for me with this truck. for your information rich at the dealer shop showed me that they will need to take a part the tailgate to replace that cover and that’s what they did, i saw it with my own eyes because i was brought to see part of the process, i saw they took the emblem off and other parts too to install the new tailgate cover but when they did this, they broke the emblem tabs and to put it back they just pushed the emblem in but the emblem never was going to hold on to its base because the tabs were broken, it held it a little but not enough to support the wind coming from the carwash blower. now the emblem is all scratched off because it fell on the carwash track chain.\\r\\ni will place reviews of this dealer on all the places i can like google and other search engines, because i do not wish for other customers to get what i got in this dealer. the last thing i would like to say is that i hope ford comes to me and calls me to get all these issues resolved but it will have to be at a different ford dealer, i’m not coming back to this dealer again in my life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\ngood bye\\r\\ndana ford lincoln\\r\\n',\n",

       " \"the day i purchased the vehicle was a great experience. it was what happened after i got the car that made this an awful experience.  i purchased the car in mid-november and it is now late december and i still have not received my permanent license plate and registration.  about once every week since purchasing my car, i was contacted by a customer rep to make sure i completed the dealership surveys with great reviews (which i did) and each time i asked about the status of my plate.  i was consistently told that it wasn't in yet, but could take up to 45 days.  when i was contacted last week, i asked about the plate and registration and i was told to call back at the end of the week, which i did.  it was on this phone call (2 days before christmas) that i was finally told my paperwork was still in the dealership and that they needed 2 copies of papers from me.  not once was i informed of this during previous calls.  the paperwork had been sitting in the dealership for 5 weeks and had not yet been sent to the dmv.  my temporary license plate was issued on nov 16th, so it is due to expire in a couple of days.  after speaking with the pennsylvania parking authority, i was told that if stopped or ticketed, my car would be taken if the plate was expired.  i also could not renew the temporary parking permit i have been getting to park in the city while i wait for the permanent plate to get a yearly pass.  i am now stuck with no parking permit and risk being ticketed or losing my car while i wait for the dealership to finally put the paperwork through.  i was told there is nothing they can do until they get the plates in and that there was just a lot of paperwork that needed to be done for an out of state registration.  i can understand that it takes a little, but that time is on top of the 5 weeks they did nothing about my paperwork.  i also wonder where the representative was looking when i asked about the status of my plate every time she called.\",\n",

(it was was last day of the month.) um news flash guys- customers do not care about your sales. they care about what they can afford and what is going to benefit their budget. could not care any less about how many sales dana makes. just want to walk away in a nice car- without getting ripped off.\\r\\nrich harley (sales) is nice- very patient and will drive through the entire lot of cars for you. he should get out of that dealership!\\r\\nprice was outrageous! went to all american and got the same exact car nearly $90 per month cheaper! great experience there-would recommend!

       " \"    recently, i purchased a car from dana ford.  a salesperson asked me to do him a favor.  he said in his e-mail, &amp;amp;quot;there's a website &amp;amp;quot;dealer rated.come/rateus that folks use to learn about car dealers.  we rely on views like yours to keep us going.&amp;amp;quot;  as for myself, i prefer to take the wait-and-see approach before rating a car dealer.  i am so glad i did.\\r\\n     initially, i had a great experience at dana ford.  the staff was very friendly.  frank curry and richard harley helped me with the purchase of my vehicle.  they were very professional, courteous, and a pleasure to deal with.  in short, they did a+ work.  it is too bad the rest of my experience with dana ford wasn't a+ as well.\\r\\n     a short time after the puchase, i realized dana ford overcharged the amount of documentary fees(plates and registration) and was due a $152.00 dollar refund. not a lot of money but still my money.   so i call them up and was told my  money  they overcharged me would be returned to me.  days and weeks go bye and still no money.  i call up again and i am told my money is on its way.  finally, i receive my check six weeks later after the purchase.  however, on the back of the check there is a disclaimer on back that states in capital letters:  &amp;amp;quot;in full settlement of all claims against dana motors ltd.&amp;amp;quot;  my first reaction was, what's this?  why would i want to put my john hancock on something that states, &amp;amp;quot;in full settlement of all claims....&amp;amp;quot;  so i call dana ford up and have been told it is their policy to issue their checks this way.  in fact, i was told the checks are preprinted that way but that is clearly not the case since the disclaimer language was stamped---not preprinted. i point this out to tony, a manager, and he said there is nothing he could do.  i politely remind him it's my money-my money and i would  like it back with no strings attached. \\r\\n      in a nutshell, i told them i would sign the check if they were to reword the language as such:  &amp;amp;quot;in full settlement as it pertains to the overcollection of documentary fees&amp;amp;quot;  otherwise, why would i want to sign something that states, &amp;amp;quot;in full settlement of all claims....&amp;amp;quot;  now hypothetically speaking:  what if i were to find out i was overcharged elsewhere by dana ford?  woundn't i potentially be giving up that claim as well? hypothetically speaking again: what if there was something wrong with the car or something that should have been disclosed about the car and wasn't( for example,the car had flood damage and they knew about it and did not discose it)?  would i be giving up that claim as well?   dana ford could not answer or explain what the disclaimer language actually meant.  i found that very curious.  basically they said was just to sign the check.  in my opinion, if you ever have to file a claim it may cost a lot more in legal fees for a lawyer to determine what was meant bye signing a check which in very general language  states, &amp;amp;quot;in full settlement of all claims against dana motors.&amp;amp;quot;   what happens if there is some type of problem with the purchase? if the lawyer sees the money returned was for being overcharged specifically, he or she does not have to worry about the general, &amp;amp;quot;in full settlement of all claims...&amp;amp;quot; nonsence. as a result, and based on principle, i refuse to sign something like that--- and bye the way the money i was overcharged is my money-my money------ dana ford---even if the amount owed is not a large sum.  \\r\\n     consequently, i contacted the new york department of consumer affairs and there response was try to work it out--sounds very reasonable to me.  thus,  i called dana ford back, but to no avail.  they did not call, e-mail, or fax me any information.  dave dioro, a manager, said he could not help me.  so i had to contact the new york department of consumers affairs again. in short, horrible horrible customer service  --in reality horrible horrible management service.   to put the situation nicely: shame on you dana ford-shame on you!!!!!  to be quite sure, i would like the return of my money without any general discaimer language that states...in full settlement of all claims...&amp;amp;quot;\\r\\n     if i have to go to court i will, although i think the situation is very unfortunate. i was told by management their lawyer said this disclaimer language was appropriate for overerpayment but i disagree.  i asked them to fax or mail me information as to what in full settlement of all claims ...actually means by their lawyer but they said they would not do it. the obvouis question is why not? i firmly believe this was a reasonable request.  in a nutshell, to make you jump through hoops to have them return your own money is plain---wrong.  so if you are going to purchase a car from dana ford or any other car dealer, i would wait-and-see before you rate them.  initially, they are very happy to take your money.  also, know what you are signing.  time will tell if you are truly happy with a dealer. for example, what happens if you are overcharged, or car has some mechanical issues and you need servicing? their reponse and actions are critical to overall dealer performance.  i sincerely hope this letter will help future car purchasers. remember, a dealer's rating may be enhanced if they are aggresive enough to  encourage you to write a review shortly after your purchase when you are generally happy and the dealer is happy to have your money.  you will notice the dealer-rater brochures at dana ford and they may ask you to rate them.   in my opinion, you should take a wait-and-see approach. thus, the dealer rating may be potentially more accurate.  had i rated dana ford initially after purchasing the car their score would have been much higher. \\r\\n \\r\\n                         sincerely yours,\\r\\n                           jrjr11\",\n",

       " \"i went to dana after receiving calls from them to terminate a previous lease that i had with them and on a 2008 linoln mkx and to upgrade to a 2011 lincoln mkx. i was told that there were great end of year programs available and that i would get a great deal on a new lease. i met with a salesman, steve nilsen, who showed me vehicles that i was interested in with available option packages. he was great and sincere throughout the whole process and truly did try to work out a deal. he quoted a fair price for a new lease that was agreed upon by his manager dave. i did not complete the contract at that time because i was unsure of the color that my wife wanted but i told steve that i would return later in the day with my wife to purchase a vehicle. he assured me, after talking with dave, that the price that we had negotiated would be honored when i return. i returned later that day with my wife. dana did not have the color that she wanted (merlot) but she settled on her 2nd choice which was black. when i sat with steve to draw up the contract things began to unravel. he got some paperwork from dave and all of a sudden, the down payment did not include the first lease payment but earlier in the day it had. the next thing i knew was that i was no longer talking to steve but was talking to lou. he agreed that the first lease payment would be included but suddenly the monthly payment went up $43. we began to haggle back and forth. finally he came down close to the original price but was still $14 over the earler price steve had guaranteed through dave. he cited that the difference was due to some accessories that i had wanted and that steve had promised to include at no cost because i had waited around he showroom for 2 1/2 hours past my appointment time to meet with steve and i was not getting my first choice of color. finally, i agreed to pay the higher amount but was really not happy about it. i gave steve my credit card for a down payment. while he was processing the payment dave came by to talk to me. i told him that i really felt that he should have given me the car at the earlier agreed price. after a brief discussion he told me rather nastily that if i wasn't happy with the deal, i should leave. unfortunately, i did not. i returned 2 days later to pick up my new mkx. when i met with steve he said the car was detailed and went to check on the vehicle. he came back and then informed me that there was damage to the front bumper\\r\\n(it had been scuffed and chipped). he was very apologetic and said that they would give me a loaner car and have the bumper repaired and repainted. he assured me that it would be as good as new.  i told him i was not comfortable with paying for a new car and receiving a repaired one. he then offered to give me another mkx exactly the same as the one that i was purchasing. i agreed but steve returned 10 minutes later and informed me that it was sold and there were no other black mkx's available on the lot. he asked if i would take a different color but there were no other colors on the lot that i was interested in. steve went to the office and lou came over. he was rather nasty and could not understand why i didn't want to take the car after was repaired. i explained that i was paying for a new car not a repaired car and that if he wanted me to take a repaired car he would have to drop the price. he refusd to do so. i told him to terminated the deal and for my credit card account to credited. he said fine and walked away. then dave came over to me. our interaction was the same as the one i had with lou. he too was rather nasty and independent. there was no negotiation. it was going to be be his way or no way. i would not give in so he agreed to credit my account and cancel the deal. i left, went to tom's ford lincoln mercury, and had a great experience. i got the color i wanted (merlot) at a better price with no hassle and was treated professionally and with respect.  \",\n",

       " 'i have waited almost 7 weeks to write this review because of issues that i had and still have it with my 2012 f150 3.5 platinum. my hell started during the purchase process, dana ford in staten island did a great job to make my life miserable during this whole process. i purchased my truck on friday and i made my decision based on reviews found on the internet about the f150, i tried a couple dealers before the purchase and finally made a decision to get it at this dealer because i found the one i wanted there. during the purchase process we reached an agreement and the truck was delivered to me with out the proper delivery process, the salesman and managers kept telling me several times about filling out this survey ok or excellent for them. i received very little information about the truck; they didn’t explain all the truck features or worse the specifics about it. when i got home the first thing i found out was the truck was larger than the one i traded in (toyota tundra limited) and i couldn’t close my garage and got very upset because i found out that night that this one was longer than my previous truck, i felt it during the ride from the dealer in new york to my house in new jersey. very unhappy about it i made my own internet research and found out the truck comes in different sizes like 145” and 157” long and comparing to my old one i needed the 145”. when you spend a lot of money on a car, you want to get what you paid for and you want to get what you want and the truck that makes you happy, this wasn’t the case for me with this truck because it felt longer and it wasn’t the one i wanted. i made the wrong decision to go back to the dealer and get the truck i wanted, the 145” that’s the truck size i been driving the last 5 years for almost every day. back at the dealer with 54 miles on the truck odometer, the salesman and the sales manager, first thing they did is to look for a way to take advantage of the situation and tried to get more money from me. after i checked others f150s with different specifics and one with a lower price of about $ 1,200.00, they proposed to me to sell me the new one and trade the one i got the day before with 54 miles on the odometer and pay them on top 2,800.00 to get the 145” size truck. i got very upset because in the way they wanted to do business with the newer truck they were clearly taking advantage and telling me in my face that i was stupid, that’s how i felt and that’s how i still feel.\\r\\nafter all discussions making the deal, which in the first place i thought they would just exchange the truck for me and any money difference will be paid either by me or by them depending on lower or higher price of the new one. they sold me the $ 1,200.00 lower price truck at the same price for my first purchase, so i knew i was loosing that money, having me in a place that i didn’t know what to do with a truck i didn’t want, i accepted to buy the 2nd. truck, very, very unhappy i signed the papers and drove home with the other one. they did the same thing with the second truck, gave me a pre-filled delivery truck sheet with all the options crossed out saying the truck is ok, repeatedly saying to me “to make sure when i get the survey i should fill it with all excellent for them because depending on that survey will be the salesman’s payment “. when receiving the truck i found the leather of the console top in the truck was scratched and asked the salesman to be addressed at what he immediately responded they will order a new cover and replace it, the salesman brought his customer relations manager to take a look at it, then he affirmed that they will put a new piece on and they will call me to schedule it.\\r\\nwaiting for almost a week i made a decision to call the dealer and ask for the console cover and also talk to them about what i found on the truck tailgate. the platinum f150 tailgate cover was coming off on one corner, i spoke to the salesman and the first thing he answered to me after listening to my complain about the tailgate is saying “ that is your responsibility because the truck has been with you for almost 1 week”, unfortunately not the best professional answer for a customer. anyway i made an appointment to bring the truck to the dealer to check it, but before my appointment the truck steering wheel column started to make a grinding noise, a clear sign that something is wrong with it. i came to the dealer and spoke to the salesman about it, they were not happy that i was complaining and bringing something new to the table. a technician checked the truck and agreed that something is wrong with the steering wheel column but proceeded to tell me that i should wait a little longer and see if the noise goes away and that they will check it again on the day my truck will be on service for the console top and tailgate cover. made an appointment for the following week to change the top of the console, fix the tailgate cover and check the steering wheel column again. basically they gave a very hard time to fix my truck, they never called back when they said they would, they wanted to do touch up work on everything since day one, wanted to buff up my console cover, they patched tape the tailgate cover and they didn’t want to fix the steering wheel column they told me that i should have some tolerance on this issues because every truck and car always will have some imperfections. after many calls to ford customer relations team i had the luck to talk to some people who helped me one way or the other, cynthia mcgregor helped a lot and i thanked her, but sometimes even for her this problem got very difficult. after all this complaining, they finally changed the console cover, they replaced the steering wheel column but during this work in the shop they scratched the 2 covers of the steering wheel base, scratched my truck left mirror and front bumper. lastly this last week i had to insist and try to get my registration and plates ready because i been asking all these passed 5 weeks but they didn’t have my name on file either, that’s what the ladies at that department said to me when they were asked for my papers and plates from me. it took almost 6 weeks and my calls to cynthia (manager from customer relations team), for them to get it ready but i have argued many times before with kendra and the other authorities at the dealer to get my truck registration and plates ready. she even hung up on me on the phone once because they couldn’t keep their promises to have the registration and plates ready at the day they said it would be ready.\\r\\nlast week i brought my truck to have the steering wheel cups replaced because they scratched it when replacing the steering wheel column, they also replaced the tailgate cover and sucked at it, they installed the new one incorrectly because now i have the same issue on the opposite side of the tailgate cover (left side). lastly one of the sales manager had the audacity to come to me and confront me asking “why i have given them a bad survey, because the only thing he had done for me was help ” that shocked me because i wouldn’t expect that from a manager (i found out his name is juan and he speaks spanish, i don’t know his last name) because he would be the right person to know what their errors and mistakes were with me when purchasing the truck and with the dealer customer service.\\r\\nmy truck tailgate still looks awful with factory quality control issues, but one thing i’m sure is that never, never in my life will i go back to this dealer and buy a car from them. because for me to go through this hell, it has been a huge nightmare and i don’t want anybody to pass it, i have been aggravated more than too many times during all this process, they disrespected me not doing/fixing things on time and in a professional manner what they had to do in the first place. they didn’t try to do what they promised to do, of course they did something but they did it because cynthia and myself had to be there to push them to do it.\\r\\njust to let you know how un-professional they are i’m going to let you know that this weekend when having my truck washed at the carwash when the truck was getting dried, the tailgate rear ford emblem fell off, at this point i didn’t know if i should scream, cry or just pray to god for better days for me with this truck. for your information rich at the dealer shop showed me that they will need to take a part the tailgate to replace that cover and that’s what they did, i saw it with my own eyes because i was brought to see part of the process, i saw they took the emblem off and other parts too to install the new tailgate cover but when they did this, they broke the emblem tabs and to put it back they just pushed the emblem in but the emblem never was going to hold on to its base because the tabs were broken, it held it a little but not enough to support the wind coming from the carwash blower. now the emblem is all scratched off because it fell on the carwash track chain.\\r\\ni will place reviews of this dealer on all the places i can like google and other search engines, because i do not wish for other customers to get what i got in this dealer. the last thing i would like to say is that i hope ford comes to me and calls me to

       " 'after bringing my car in to dana ford service on thursday february 11th i received the car back on wednesday february 17th. all that needed to be done was tire pressure sensor reset, horn to be fixed, and noise when turning the steering wheel. i called several times for updates and was promised a call back on more than 5 occasions, finally on the 6th attempt i received a phone call back, this was over the course of 4 days.\\r\\n\\r\\nafter finally getting my car back and getting home, i noticed that the bumper wasnt fully on. they forgot to put retaining screws into the wheel well liner and under the bumper causing the liner to drag and scrape my tire. after calling about this i was told to come in within 30 minutes and it will be taken care of right away. i came in and was told it will be an hour or two to put in the 6 screws missing. i said thats ridiculous and asked them for the screws and that i would do it myself. they happily provided me with the screws and i laid on the floor in the service center screwing in these screws by hand.\\r\\n\\r\\noh and they promised that the techs checked the fluid level but the anti freeze was never refilled so i had them do that when i came back as well. \\r\\n\\r\\nin summary this experience was on the level of some shady mechanic and not something one would expect from a dealership.',\n",
       " \"the day i purchased the vehicle was a great experience. it was what happened after i got the car that made this an awful experience.  i purchased the car in mid-november and it is now late december and i still have not received my permanent license plate and registration.  about once every week since purchasing my car, i was contacted by a customer rep to make sure i completed the dealership surveys with great reviews (which i did) and each time i asked about the status of my plate.  i was consistently told that it wasn't in yet, but could take up to 45 days.  when i was contacted last week, i asked about the plate and registration and i was told to call back at the end of the week, which i did.  it was on this phone call (2 days before christmas) that i was finally told my paperwork was still in the dealership and that they needed 2 copies of papers from me.  not once was i informed of this during previous calls.  the paperwork had been sitting in the dealership for 5 weeks and had not yet been sent to the dmv.  my temporary license plate was issued on nov 16th, so it is due to expire in a couple of days.  after speaking with the pennsylvania parking authority, i was told that if stopped or ticketed, my car would be taken if the plate was expired.  i also could not renew the temporary parking permit i have been getting to park in the city while i wait for the permanent plate to get a yearly pass.  i am now stuck with no parking permit and risk being ticketed or losing my car while i wait for the dealership to finally put the paperwork through.  i was told there is nothing they can do until they get the plates in and that there was just a lot of paperwork that needed to be done for an out of state registration.  i can understand that it takes a little, but that time is on top of the 5 weeks they did nothing about my paperwork.  i also wonder where the representative was looking when i asked about the status of my plate every time she called.\",\n",
       " \"i am sorry that i ever wrote a positive review of this place.  while my salesman was excellent, the staff at this dealership are severely lacking in clerical and customer support skills.  i phoned two weeks after my purchase to ensure that my registration documentation was properly filed (i do not live in ny), and they told me that there were missing items.  that's right, i had to call them to find out that some documentation was missing.  what was missing?  a copy of the back of my driver's license, which they could have easily obtained at any point.  that, and they mentioned that the effective date of my insurance was wrong.  to recap, they made the phone call to organize the insurance change.  this is all after an e-mail the day after my purchase to double check that they didn't need anything additional from me.  i needed the registration process to be expedited, as my neighborhood is resident permit parking only.  now my registration is delayed another two weeks, during which time i cannot park in my neighborhood.  to make everything more frustrating, everyone i spoke to on the phone was pretty rude, and didn't really care about taking care of me.  i mean, what do they have in it?  they already sold me a car.\\r\\n\\r\\nas a side note, rich was a great salesman.\",\n",

       " \"    recently, i purchased a car from dana ford.  a salesperson asked me to do him a favor.  he said in his e-mail, &amp;amp;quot;there's a website &amp;amp;quot;dealer rated.come/rateus that folks use to learn about car dealers.  we rely on views like yours to keep us going.&amp;amp;quot;  as for myself, i prefer to take the wait-and-see approach before rating a car dealer.  i am so glad i did.\\r\\n     initially, i had a great experience at dana ford.  the staff was very friendly.  frank curry and richard harley helped me with the purchase of my vehicle.  they were very professional, courteous, and a pleasure to deal with.  in short, they did a+ work.  it is too bad the rest of my experience with dana ford wasn't a+ as well.\\r\\n     a short time after the puchase, i realized dana ford overcharged the amount of documentary fees(plates and registration) and was due a $152.00 dollar refund. not a lot of money but still my money.   so i call them up and was told my  money  they overcharged me would be returned to me.  days and weeks go bye and still no money.  i call up again and i am told my money is on its way.  finally, i receive my check six weeks later after the purchase.  however, on the back of the check there is a disclaimer on back that states in capital letters:  &amp;amp;quot;in full settlement of all claims against dana motors ltd.&amp;amp;quot;  my first reaction was, what's this?  why would i want to put my john hancock on something that states, &amp;amp;quot;in full settlement of all claims....&amp;amp;quot;  so i call dana ford up and have been told it is their policy to issue their checks this way.  in fact, i was told the checks are preprinted that way but that is clearly not the case since the disclaimer language was stamped---not preprinted. i point this out to tony, a manager, and he said there is nothing he could do.  i politely remind him it's my money-my money and i would  like it back with no strings attached. \\r\\n      in a nutshell, i told them i would sign the check if they were to reword the language as such:  &amp;amp;quot;in full settlement as it pertains to the overcollection of documentary fees&amp;amp;quot;  otherwise, why would i want to sign something that states, &amp;amp;quot;in full settlement of all claims....&amp;amp;quot;  now hypothetically speaking:  what if i were to find out i was overcharged elsewhere by dana ford?  woundn't i potentially be giving up that claim as well? hypothetically speaking again: what if there was something wrong with the car or something that should have been disclosed about the car and wasn't( for example,the car had flood damage and they knew about it and did not discose it)?  would i be giving up that claim as well?   dana ford could not answer or explain what the disclaimer language actually meant.  i found that very curious.  basically they said was just to sign the check.  in my opinion, if you ever have to file a claim it may cost a lot more in legal fees for a lawyer to determine what was meant bye signing a check which in very general language  states, &amp;amp;quot;in full settlement of all claims against dana motors.&amp;amp;quot;   what happens if there is some type of problem with the purchase? if the lawyer sees the money returned was for being overcharged specifically, he or she does not have to worry about the general, &amp;amp;quot;in full settlement of all claims...&amp;amp;quot; nonsence. as a result, and based on principle, i refuse to sign something like that--- and bye the way the money i was overcharged is my money-my money------ dana ford---even if the amount owed is not a large sum.  \\r\\n     consequently, i contacted the new york department of consumer affairs and there response was try to work it out--sounds very reasonable to me.  thus,  i called dana ford back, but to no avail.  they did not call, e-mail, or fax me any information.  dave dioro, a manager, said he could not help me.  so i had to contact the new york department of consumers affairs again. in short, horrible horrible customer service  --in reality horrible horrible management service.   to put the situation nicely: shame on you dana ford-shame on you!!!!!  to be quite sure, i would like the return of my money without any general discaimer language that states...in full settlement of all claims...&amp;amp;quot;\\r\\n     if i have to go to court i will, although i think the situation is very unfortunate. i was told by management their lawyer said this disclaimer language was appropriate for overerpayment but i disagree.  i asked them to fax or mail me information as to what in full settlement of all claims ...actually means by their lawyer but they said they would not do it. the obvouis question is why not? i firmly believe this was a reasonable request.  in a nutshell, to make you jump through hoops to have them return your own money is plain---wrong.  so if you are going to purchase a car from dana ford or any other car dealer, i would wait-and-see before you rate them.  initially, they are very happy to take your money.  also, know what you are signing.  time will tell if you are truly happy with a dealer. for example, what happens if you are overcharged, or car has some mechanical issues and you need servicing? their reponse and actions are critical to overall dealer performance.  i sincerely hope this letter will help future car purchasers. remember, a dealer's rating may be enhanced if they are aggresive enough to  encourage you to write a review shortly after your purchase when you are generally happy and the dealer is happy to have your money.  you will notice the dealer-rater brochures at dana ford and they may ask you to rate them.   in my opinion, you should take a wait-and-see approach. thus, the dealer rating may be potentially more accurate.  had i rated dana ford initially after purchasing the car their score would have been much higher. \\r\\n \\r\\n                         sincerely yours,\\r\\n                           jrjr11\",\n",
