5,"March 31, 2020","We had an amazing experience all the way around, from the beginning of our sale to the end of our purchase.  The dealership was friendly and kind.  Our salesman, Steve Tibbets, was awesome and was all about great customer service.  Everyone was willing to go the extra mile in helping us find the car that we were looking for.  Once we identified it, we walked around to locate the car.  We soon came to find out that the car was not on their lot and they quickly solved that dilemma by delivering the car straight to the dealership that we were at.  The purchase of the car was quick in consideration to most dealerships and it was not a painful experience at all.  They were even willing to work with us on getting us the right payment.  Upon delivery of our amazing RX450h, Steve put a big red bow on top,  took pictures of us, and made a cool video for us to share with our friends.  OUTSTANDING!",5.0

I've been shopping at other dealerships, but Mo was by far the most helpful and patient sales representative I encountered. He was very helpful and patient.

I would recommend going to Newport Lexus and speaking to Mo if your looking for the best deal. ,5.0

Curtis Lineberry listened to, and then addressed, my expectations with respect to price and trade-in.  He responded with clarity as to what he could do and why.  I then made the buy decision and completed the deal.  He didn't start with the typical sales approach, let's negotiate and run back and forth to get approval.

46,"November 01, 2019","Newport Lexus has fine cars and great people  with. whom I dealt.  Their prices are competitive and the dealership is located fairly close to where I work.  We were looking for a specific car and we searched a number of other Lexus dealers, but Newport had the best options from which to choose. Kudos especially to Mike Shimon who really knows his products and is very pleasant and very helpful both during and after the sale.",5.0
47,"October 30, 2019","My first Lexus after owning Infiniti, BMW and Jaguars. After 6 months, it's the best car I've owned. The NX300 is brilliant.
Salesman was great. First service was great.
Downside was Finance guy. Extreme pressure to buy service and damage insurance. It was brutal. I almost walked out on the deal. Beware!
Also, disappointment that after 6 months, no one from dealership called to see how I liked the car or if I needed any help. No follow-up on a $50,000 purchase. You'd think I bought a toaster.",4.0
48,"October 29, 2019","As always, Newport Lexus did a fine job in servicing our RX 350.  It was easy to schedule the service online.  We were met immediately when we drove up and directed to the Service Rep, Kevin Nessl.  Kevin is always professional and very easy to work with.  He kept us updated on the possibility of needing rear brakes.  

We were going to wait for the car, but Kevin said it might take a bit longer because of the brakes and offered us a loaner.  The service was completed in a very timely manner.   AND of course, our very dirty car was washed for us and looked great! 

Great car... great car dealership!! ",4.8

54,"October 11, 2019","My family has had four or five Lexuses - Lexi? - three of them purchased at Newport Lexus, other two at CarMax. They have all been serviced at Newport Lexus, no matter their provenance. Why?

First, Lexus cars deserve the best care possible, not what you get at your local Joe-and-Jim Garage. They are high end machines, and deserve the special attention and knowledge the dealership provides. May cost a little more, but you know you are getting the best.

Second, Newport Lexus is immaculately clean. Customer facilities -- lounge, rest rooms, snack bar -- are what you expect at 5-star hotels. Staff is courteous and well-trained.

Third, Customer service reps, ditto. My dealings have all been with Joey Wilchek. For my money, he sets the gold standard for quick comprehension of problem, product knowledge, helpfulness, communication and those almost indefinable qualities  -- a positive attitude, pride in his work, and likeability. On a scale of one-to-ten, I give Joey an eleven or twelve.",5.0
55,"October 05, 2019","My experience in purchasing my first car exceeded my expectations. Mo Qureshi was extremely helpful and didn’t make me feel pressured in any way.

I would give Mr. Qureshi at lest 10m stars.",5.0

64,"September 07, 2019",My wife and I searched for a car over Labor Day weekend going to multiple dealers before finally ending up at Newport Lexus and buying our car.  Through all the sales pitches and advertisements of deals the only dealership to come through was Newport Lexus not only did Tatiana work with us and not force us to look at cars we didn’t want to but she smoothed the process out and got us in and out of there within two hours!  We are extremely happy with the service and treatment we received from Newport Lexus and would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a new car!,5.0
65,"September 05, 2019","Newport Lexus has been my dealership from 2011 when I bought my first Lexus. Since 2011 I’ve been given the ultimate service by every single person I’ve been in contact with. I also own a Mercedes Benz, have owned an Audi as well as an Acura, and Newport Lexus as a dealership is head and shoulders above the rest. The cars themselves are so amazingly luxurious and will last you a long time. My IS 250 had 160K miles when I sold it this past weekend, and of course, I bought a new one at Newport Lexus. When you get the kind of service they provide, and match it with the most amazing cars available, it’s a win win!! I will absolutely refer Newport Lexus to anyone I know, as well as brag about them to those I don’t know. Yes, my experience has been that amazing!! Top notch service by top notch people!!",5.0

67,"August 29, 2019","This is my 4th car from Newport Lexus and my first time working with Scott since my previous sales consultant left the company.  Prior to this encounter, I had taken my previous car in for scheduled service and was looking at the cars in the showroom.  Scott introduced himself and asked if I needed assistance.  I told him what I was there for and he then proceeded to ask me about my car and when my lease was up.  I wasn’t really looking to get out of my lease, but figured I would see what he could do on an RX.  As I suspected, we weren’t able to make a deal that day, but I was impressed with how he handled himself and the lengths he was going to to get me the best deal possible.  Fast forward a few weeks later where I attended a Lexus Driving Event and test drove the new ES 350 F Sport.  I was very impressed and was seriously considering making this my next car when my lease was up.  The next day I went back to Newport Lexus and saw Scott who remembered me from our first encounter.  I asked to test drive the ES on the freeway to see how it handled, which it did not disappoint.  Knowing we couldn’t make the RX happen, I didn’t think he could make the ES happen either...but he did!  I’m so happy with the car and I’m still impressed with his level of service after the sale.  He’s been an absolute pleasure to work with and anytime I’m at the dealership for service, I will make it a point to seek him out just to say hi.  I will refer all my family and friends to him if they are in the market for a Lexus. He’s one of the best sales consultants I’ve worked with and I have dealt with many.

I would also like to acknowledge Joey Wilcheck in Service.  He is so awesome, easy to work with, and takes care of me every single time I’m in for service.  I trust him and know that he’s going to be absolutely honest with me.  He calls when he says he’s going to call, and if it’s going to take longer than expected he’ll pick up the phone to let me know.  He’s the best!

I’ve also worked with Yas in Finance a few times and she’s such a pleasure to work with.  She’s very personable and makes the finance part so fun that I hate leaving once all the paperwork has been finalized.  

It’s the level of service and people at Newport Lexus that has kept me coming back.  ",5.0

70,"August 17, 2019","I leased a 2019 Lexus ES350 from Newport Lexus yesterday.  This was by far the very best shopping experience I have ever encountered!  I came into the dealership without setting an appointment, was really just browsing and did not expect to drive off with a new car at all.  I know my credit wasn't perfect, far from it, so I was just mostly window shopping.  I was introduced to Mo Qureshi through the front desk.  They really have a great system where they made sure every customer is being helped right away.  He came across as very sincere.  He was paying attention to address all of my concern and he listened to my needs.  He assured me that he and his sales and finance managers would do their very best to assist me to get me approved for the car.  It did not take long at all, but they went out of their way to get me fully approved for the Lexus and I ended up driving home with the car the same day! And I did not take the whole day! The entire process from beginning to end took about 3 hours. This says alot from someone who came to the dealership expecting nothing but was just window shopping.  Thank you Mo, his sales manager Fred, and finance manager Yasmine for delivering the best shopping experience! I would encourage everyone who in considering buying a Lexus to consider Newport Lexus first, you will not regret it!

Thank you Newport Lexus!",5.0

73,"August 07, 2019","I cash purchased a 2011 LX 570 through Newport Lexus Internet Sales Manager, Mr Ostergaard. Because the vehicle was being sold “As Is” and it was being shipped to MN I asked MANY questions to determine its condition.  I was assured there were no mechanical defects; body imperfections, including the most visible ones on the rear spoiler, were cosmetic; the entertainment system, a feature my grandchildren were excited about, was fully operational.

On arrival, my LX 570 presented with 2 prominent body parts completely missing (I do not recall them missing in the ad pics); a rear spoiler broken in several pieces and well-beyond repair; warning lights indicating the Tire Pressure Management System was malfunctioning, and the entertainment system missing components necessary to operate it. My local Lexus dealer estimated the cost to remediate these defects at about $5,000, including an oil change that was apparently overdue.

I appealed to Newport Lexus Internet Sales Director, Mr Locastro who reiterated the vehicle was sold “As Is” and implied I had no right to rely on the veracity of Manager Ostergaard to honestly tell me what the “As Is” condition was. We are not under that duty. Hoping to strike a compromise, I offered to pay labor if Newport Lexus would help me out with the parts. Mr Locastro laughed at me and said “that’s not going to happen”. Mr D’Amato, General Manager, backed his management staff and tacitly endorsed their sales practices. Lexus Corporate, on investigation, said they would not intervene as each dealer is independently owned and is free to conduct business in whatever way best suits them. 

Newport Lexus, and Lexus Corporate for that matter, hypes their high-minded commitment to customer satisfaction, but all levels of their management team have demonstrated themselves to be nothing more than typical car jockeys; shysters willing to say anything to make a sale. Non-local customers are, apparently, of little incentive or importance to Newport Lexus. Internet buyers be very wary.  ",1.2

99,"June 10, 2019","This place has been a nightmare since the time we drove off the lot. We purchase a used vehicle with Newport Lexus and have felt like they could care less about servicing customers. I am going to say the worst part first so people will read this. The worse part (which happened after the other parts) is they sold us a Car that they didn't have a title for (pretty sure this is illegal). We purchase our Van Feb 6th and 2 months later were notified by the bank that they did not receive the title. I called Newport Lexus and they said they would get back to me in 20 minutes. 4 Hours later I called them back and they would not take my call. I spent 2 days trying to get a hold of some to fix this. My Bank also called them a handful of time and could not get a hold of them. Finally we talked to someone on May 1st and they told us they did not have the title from the previous owner (whoops on their part) and they talked to the DMV and the title was on its way. Fast forward to now (June), I was notified by my bank that they still have not received the title and I realized I still have not received my registration (its now been 4 months since the purchase). I called Newport Lexus again and had to call back 4 times to get a person on the phone. Like usually they said they would get back to me and nothing. I called my bank and learned that Newport Lexus had lied to us on May 1st saying it was taken care of when in all actuality they didn't file with the DMV til May 24th (pretty much a whole month went by). My car which is now past the 90 day temp registration is un-drivable because its not technically registered. These guys got there money and don't seem to care to help. As this is still all going down. 

Now that the worst part has been stated I want to tell you about the fun we had when I drove off the lot with bad front breaks (that they passed on inspection of the car). I had to take the car back to Newport Lexus 3 times for them to fix, which they didn't. I finally took it to Honda and made them pay me back. Oh BTW they were hard to get a hold of during this as well. recommendation to you is to drive a little bit further to another Lexus dealer cause these guys are clearly not detail oriented or really care about the customer.",1.0

We had a small glitch with the car two days later getting error alerts on the dash, but Mo was on top of it stepping in to advise what we should do.

Sean told me that they will inspect the tire thoroughly and will inform me if it is repairable and safe to use. 
After couple of hours Sean approached me and told me that they repaired the tire and showed me a picture of my tire with the nail. Assured me that it is safe to use and iit is according to manufacturer’s standard. He even had time to show and explain  it to me using the model car’s tire in the showroom.

145,"December 19, 2018","I purchased Lexus IS 200T from Newport Lexus in September,2018

I am writing this for customers who deserve better services and treats, based on facts.
I had an issue that should’ve been remained a small issue with management & dealer, and it was about my 2nd key and their attitudes.
Let me just saying problems I think of this New port Lexus overall.  MY DEALER didn’t answer my call, email or voicemail.  In other words, it was very unprofessional behavior about A/S.  His attitude to customer wasn’t great; he literally stopped talking to me after seeing bad review on him from me instead of fixing the problem with me via much smoother way. I just did my right to do as a customer who spends a lot of money on what they are selling. Speaking of which, even I sent an apology email to the dealer about the review, for god sake! 
About the INTERNET SALES MANAGER, he said “There is nothing I can do about it, since I didn’t make a dime from the deal between your dealer and you, sir. You have to talk with your dealer”, the reason I talked to him was just because the dealer is not responding me at all. In my perspective I believe that he didn’t want to be in charge to solve the problem. I just gave up on him after what he told me. 
I emailed to the GENERAL MANAGER to discuss about this, he is the exactly same like others. Through Yelp, he said that he is willing to fix problem, but all he did for me was ignoring me and passing around the responsibility to others. 
Here is what happened. Since the dealer ignored me, I talked with the internet sales manager about 2nd key. He emailed me that says “OK perfect so wait till receive the registration. As far as the key, dealers have different accounts. We cannot do that. If you want to go there (other Lexus dealership), that is fine then you shall make your key and send us the bill so we get a check and mail to you”; from my email. He made me to get a new key ($477), then refused to pay back, just because it was too expensive and he didn’t want to pay it from his pocket.  
So I had to open an official claim through Lexus HQ to get the reimbursement. This whole process was so messed up and frustrating to me. Hope anyone read this, please reconsider where you want to get your car.

As a result, I visited Newport Lexus with trepidation. Fortunately, the first person to greet me as I pulled into the parking lot was Mo Qureshi, who very quickly set my mind at ease. He was friendly, informative, and professional, without being pushy at all--in short, all I could have wanted in a salesman. I felt very comfortable working with him through the buying process, and I left the dealership feeling positive about the transaction. Mo will be the first person I consult the next time I am in the market for a new car, and I would not hesitate to recommend him to my friends. 

Anita Rami in Finance was also helpful and informative, and Peter Perez in Service was very professional. In fact, everyone I came into contact with at Newport Lexus was friendly and professional. It's obvious that the quality of the staff is a cut above that of most other dealerships. That goes a long way toward reassuring me that I purchased an excellent product. ",4.8

I just had a lovely phone conversation with the sales manager Fred Mahjoob today and he was the rudest ,nastiest person I have ever dealt with. You would think they would treat their customers with respect but they do not! The sales man Anthony told us the dealer  would cover the last 3 payments on my old lease and he wrote down on a payment waiver form the 3 months . Lexus has a program where you can turn in your old lease early if you lease a new Lexus which we always do. To my surprise today Fred the sales manager decided they would only cover 2 months and would not honor what they said 2 weeks ago when we bought the car. Luckily I had lexus financial on a 3 way call with Fred and they heard and recorded the entire conversation. Thankfully the representative from Lexus financial was apologetic and said she has never encountered a call like this with a dealership before. I have never been disrespected and yelled at over the phone by anyone like this before and I will never buy a car from this dealership again. If you tell your customer you are going to do something you should do it  instead of yell at your customer over the phone like a animal. We have been loyal Lexus customers for over 10 year and will never step foot in Newport Lexus again!  An animal like Fred should not be allowed to speak to customers over the phone and should have some self respect rather than yell at people over the phone because he lies to his customers. Fred should be required to take an anger management class or should not be in a position that has to deal with human beings.

When I earlier this year started considering buying my 3rd Lexus, I just knew who I was going to contact regarding the buy, as I had been so very pleased with the service, friendliness and professionalism both from Gary K and Newport Lexus  in 2010.  A great and positive experience I always remember. 
I did a lot of research on my new car, both the car itself and the prices on the different packages offered. This way when I contacted Gary,  I knew what car and package I wanted, and Gary found the exact one for me. And, I do love my car! I was very pleased with the arrangement we came to, as I had checked prices at other Lexus dealers. Also, walking in as a single female, it was important to me to be treated correctly, and not have the so called, ""used car salesman"" sales technique tried on me.  
Anyway, I am so pleased to be dealing with Gary K, as I do know for 100% sure, that if I have any questions at all, I can call him, and that is truly appreciated. 
Also, I got to say, Newport Lexus is the best, the place classy, and so are all the friendly people I have been in contact with there. It is a pleasure dealing with the company.

Gary greeted me and told me to look around and let him know if I find anything I like, he wasn't pushy or anything. I did find a car I absolutely loved and he offered to let me drive it, we had great conversation in the car and he was very honest with me. He let me know what he wasn't trying to push me into buying something I didn't love, that made me feel good, who wants to be pushed into buying a 30k dollar car, not me. So I told him I would think about it and come back in a week, he called once to check in and I let him know I would be in contact with him. I didn't get daily calls to hurry and get the car before someone else buys it. There was fluid communication with Gary and I the entire time which made this a nice experience . I came back a week later and let him know I was coming that morning, the car was pulled up front, looking better then ever and I bought her that day.

277,"January 10, 2018","Sales man appeared to be very knowledgeable on vehicle. However, after I drove off I experienced several issues.
My GS350F has a safety feature that shakes the steering wheel when I cross lanes. I was not told this so  I thought I had a flat because the wheel was shaking. I kept pulling over to see no flat. After several occasions I thought I had unbalanced wheels or bad alignment. I drove the car back and the Service Foreman explained this feature and how to turn it off. Foreman was outstanding because we drove the car and he explained a lot more about the car. Salesman told me to download the 2.0 Entune app that was the wrong one and I spent 2 days trying to register the vehicle to no avail. He finely told me he gave me the wrong info. I thought it was a great to have your name in neon when you buy I wish this was done for me. It's even the little things that keeps customer back.
Salesman said we couldn't register the internet features in the sales garage because there was no service in the garage. I don't think it would be too hard to pull the car forward 10 feet, register the car and make sure the customer is all done when he leaves after buying a new Lexus. Rather leaving me on my own when I drive off. I just found out this dealership offers free car washes but I'm unsure it apply to me. I could go on but I thinks this is enough unanswered question from a new Lexus Owner.
Reason for not leaving 1 star is because everyone at Newport Lexus is so nice and it's a beautiful dealership. However, when I buy my next car I will ask to have the features explained by the shop Formen.",3.0

279,"January 08, 2018","I am a previous Newport Lexus customer who purchased my IS350 and recall a hassle free and very competitively priced deal that I felt was extremely a good value.  Subsequently, the Service team has consistently taken care of me at each of my scheduled services into my 4th year of ownership. Service Consultant Robert Nunez has always been there to answer questions and help me.  Recently it was time for my mother to purchase a new vehicle and she chose Lexus based upon current styling and from the Service experience I've described from Newport Lexus.

I was introduced to both Nasser Naderi and Sales Manager Fred Mahjoob and they both couldn't have made the selection and purchase any easier.  Nasser was very patient, polite and accommodating to the requirements (color, trim etc) that we were looking for.  After finalizing the color and trim selection, Fred wrote a deal that couldn't be passed on.  Fred truly made it a ""December to Remember"".  

Even at delivery, Nasser took the time to patiently show my elderly mother all the features of the car at a very comfortable pace and even placed the ever important GIANT RED RIBBON BOW on the car to make the purchase feel that much more special for my mother.

A high standard of ""Service"" for any retailer is often the most difficult component to retain it's luster and in my opinion, Newport Lexus has been putting much effort into it and maintaining its Service shine.   Thank you Newport Lexus!",5.0
280,"January 08, 2018","My wife and I were looking for a new car seeing as I had just paid off the last of my student loans and my old 2005 Camry had 204,000 miles on it.  It sure served me well.  

Last year, my parents had bought a car (RX 350) from Mo Qureshi at Newport Lexus and they made a point to say how much they appreciated the car buying experience.  After they came home with their new car, I took it for a spin around the block while visiting them.  It drove so smooth.  They told me about the Lexus Certified Preowned program and what a value it is.  

A couple months ago my brother and sister-in-law were looking for a new car.  They literally researched and test-drove every type of car.  Ultimately, my parents directed them to Mo at Newport Lexus where they purchased an RX 350 (identical to my parents).  They really appreciated their car-buying experience with Mo and they highly recommended we go see him.  

Now, fast-forward to the last week of December 2017 and my wife and I are ready to buy a new car.  Mo knew I was coming and it was nice to already have that contact.  When we met him, it was very pleasant right off the bat. He already knew what we were looking for (which was an RX350 just like everybody else in my family... ha).  Before we had arrived Mo had already combed through the Certified Preowned 2015 RX 350's and found a couple that were great value and great condition.  We are very happy with Mo's attention to detail.  

We were shown a particular 2015 RX 350 that was in great shape and even had chrome rims.  We were also particularly happy that it has just recently been price-reduced (by $5,000) to sell before year's end.  Mo was very honest with us about the shape of the vehicle and the value of the price.  I appreciated that he steered us to it right off the bat.  Unfortunately, it was dark already when we arrived and did the test drive and I wanted to see it in the daylight since it had black paint and I wanted to examine it for any other scratches or problems.  Mo was very kind and understanding with us and we scheduled a visit the next day at 1pm for a final inspection and purchase.  

I greatly appreciate Mo's honesty with the cars we looked at and how pleasant of a guy he is.  He had already done his homework for us when we arrived and so we didn't have to waste time looking at cars that weren't what we wanted.  He handpicked our car for us because it was the best condition-to-value ration on the lot.  He made our experience very pleasant, and I had no doubt that he kept our best interests in mind as we shopped and bought our new car.  Ironically, my father, my brother, and I each now own an identical 2015 black Lexus RX 350, courtesy of Mo Qureshi.  At this point, I wouldn't bother with any other dealer for future purchases.  I am very happy with my experience at Newport Lexus and with Mo Qureshi, in particular.  At this point, I really don't need to go anywhere else.  

I also want to point out our positive experience with the Finance department, specifically Anita Rami.  She was very pleasant even though it was the last weekend of 2017 and the dealership was buzzing with activity.  They had apparently sold 18 cars already by mid-afternoon.  In particular I want to point out that she went out of her way to get us an even lower interest rate (a full point lower, in fact) that what was initially offered.  This was very handy and helped reduce the monthly payments.  She was also just a really nice person to chat with and discuss the different additional features offered.

I've received 3 months waver Directly from Lexus corporate and Ali promised that for a returning customer Newport Lexus will wave addition 3 months of my lease payments so I could trade in my car 6 months early. Upon my arrival to the dealership Ali completely forgot about this promise. I do not want to call him a liar but he is very forgetful (More on this below).
Over the phone we agreed on the discount that I was looking for and Ali called me within an hour confirming that my deal 14% off of MSRP was approved. I was negotiating for a car with MSRP of $57K so I was expecting to see negotiated price in a range close to $49K (57-14% = 49).
Upon arrival Ali showed me my final price of $51.5K I informed him that this is not what we have agreed on the phone. Ali informed me that this is the best the he could do.
I had another quote from dealership that is about 60 miles from my home so at this point I informed Ali that another dealership can do this deal.
After another back and forth and meeting some other people I had no interest in meeting I have agreed to the deal that was worse than what was originally promised and another dealer was willing to do.
Upon signing documents I’ve asked Ali when is he going to look at my current leased car that I was exchanging to which Ali replied that today he is just selling me another car and I will have to deal with lease return on my own.

With his assistance we got what we wanted for the price that we cannot believed. We were not pressured to buy additional coverage by the finance people which that is great. 

Newport was our first stop and Youssef shown us around and offer us for a test drive. It was our first stop so we decided not to. Then we visited 2 additional dealer, Elmore Lexus and Westminster Lexus. Both are nice places, but they did not have what we wanted, a Silver NX FSport with black interior. They did have the NX FSport in a different combination which we were willing to work with but we were unable to work with the other stuffs. So when Youssef call us, we asked him to if he meets everything that the other 2 dealer had offered then we will be there to buy it. We got the answer really quickly and within hours, we drove off with the SUV that we wanted. 

If you are looking for a Lexus, stop at Newport and ask for Youssef. If you are shopping around then stop here last and they are willing to work with a professional attitude.

362,"September 04, 2017","My wife and I had been to several dealerships looking for a new car when my parents recommended a Lexus Certified from Newport Lexus and more specifically, to Mo Qureshi.  They had just bought an RX350 from him a year ago and talked about what a great experience they had working with Mo.  Let me just say that right from the beginning Mo struck me as a completely different type of salesman than any I had dealt with before.  Mo was extremely warm and friendly, knowledgeable, and most importantly patient in working with us to find the right car.  At no point did I feel pressured during the process which meant a lot to me.  It was like working with a close family member than a typical salesman. I hate high pressure salesmen! 

In the end, we finally found an RX350 we were interested in and Mo made sure we felt happy with the deal.  He made the purchase as smooth and easy as possible and even maximized efficiency by going over all the features of the car with us while we were waiting to go through finance (it was a busy day).  Matt Mahjoob in finance was friendly too and upfront with us while we did the paperwork and answered all our questions.  Once we finalized the paperwork, we were on our way only having spent a few hours at the dealer.  Mo even called us the following day just to make sure we didn't have any questions about the car.  This was perfect timing as my wife and I just happened to be fiddling with programming the garage opener.

My wife and I absolutely loved our experience at Newport Lexus.  The prices were very competitive, the inventory was great, and Mo was superb!  Words cannot describe how comfortable he made us feel, the value of his insight and advice, or how much he made us feel like family.  Perhaps the best compliment that we can give is that after our experience, we are referring my brother and sister-in-law to Mo at Newport Lexus to get their new car.  ",5.0

379,"August 02, 2017","My lease was up on my 2015 IS 250 and no one bother to contact me to see what I wanted to do from the dealer I leased it from?  I contacted Ali Moallem and he got back with me immediately.  He was professional and upfront.  I felt I could feel his sincerity through his immediate follow up email and phone call.  I went down looking for an NX F sport base white with red interior that was due any day from Texas. I test drove the NX I needed something bigger to transport my paintings.  I met his manager Freddy Mahjoob that got me a better deal on a loaded NX 200t F sport for a similar payment I already had!  His brother Matt Mahjoob was also very nice and educated me on the benefits of lease wear and tear which I happily purchased!  It was a very nice experience I felt I was shopping at South Coast Plaza but it was very casual and no pressure.  People do business with people they like and trust.  Ali is in a world class of his own he is charming and professional.  My uncle is a Viet Nam veteran and lost his limb in the war and I know the pain he has endured living with a prosthetic it is very painful especially worn all day.  I realize that Ali also wears one but you could not tell when you see him hustle on your behalf!  Ali's dedication to my customer satisfaction walking to and fro on the dealership grounds getting me my car for test drive.  Taking it to the wash and deliver and the amount of time he spent going over the benefits and features as well as signing me up for Lexus Enform the process was a half day event.  Ali did it with enthusiasm and and a genuine smile.  He made me feel if I was Bruce Wayne and he was her at my service and for that I know who I will be returning to when my lease is up!  Ali Moallem for the win please let him give you the one of a kind Lexus experience plus he will keep you smiling the whole time!

403,"June 21, 2017","The day I called Newport Lexus was a lucky day for me. I was lucky enough to get connected with Nasser Naderi. I asked him if he could get me a special request car after checking with several dealers that did not want to work the system for a special request 2018 LC500' Nasser was immediately involved in locating me my vehicle. He worked and worked the system to get the car that I wanted.  It was going to be built and delivered to Dallas Texas. Nasser said that he could get the car for me and have it re-routed to Newport Lexus.  I was sceptical since no other dealer offered to do this for me, He assured me that he could get it done. He informed every time the vehicle made it to the next step. He informed me when It was completed on the assembly line and when it was on the boat headed to the Long Beach port. He kept me informed  the ETA for the dealership. During my wait for the car Nasser was kind enough to email me the owners manual so that I could get familiar with the car. The car arrived and he had all of the extras completed on time and as promised. He picked me up at the airport first thing in the morning for my special day. We test drove the car and he explained the car and the performance details.
Then Matt Mahjoob took over the transaction and explained all of the benefits of the Cilajet and prepaid maintenance plan and prepaid service plan. Matt was very professional and knowledgeable and made the new car buying experience a hassle free and enjoyable experience.  After Matt was done Nasser introduced me to Bill Pippin from the management team. Bill was kind enough to spend some time with me explaining some of the details about the car. Then Nasser spent the afternoon explaining all of the details of the car and how to operate the systems.  Nasser knows the product inside and out and did an excellent job in explaining the functions of the electronics. I honestly spoke to alot of salesmen about the LC 500 and most of them did not have near the knowledge that Nasser has.
So far these last two days Nasser has called me to check in on me to see if he could answer any questions and make sure that everything is allright with the car.
Newport Lexus is not my local dealership but I assure you that they will be my dealer of choice in the future and I will recommend Newport Lexus and Nasser Naderi to my friends or associates.
Thank you Nasser Naderi, Matt Mahjoob, and Bill Pippin for a great new car buying experience.

My girlfriend and I initially had a knowledgeable salesperson, who, after spending an extended period of time with us, test driving two vehicles and showing us differences between model years, had to keep a previously set appointment with his returning long-time lease customer. 

The initial salesman introduced us to Nasser, their internet sales person, who was polite, professional, and also knew the Lexus product line well. We again drove vehicles and almost agreed on one. too many good choices!! We returned the next morning and made our decision.

The transaction was seamless and relatively fast, about 2 and 1/2 to three hours total time spent, including extra test drives and coffee. The dealership is like no other, with free car washes, almost indefinitely, and an on-site lounge, gift shop - bar and restaurant. Free service calls, I think 4 visits in the next two years. 

A great, large property and relatively new building that appears top notch. Almost too much, but very cool.

Serious stock with tons of selection.

Nicole was able to quickly confirm that the three cars I was interested in were still available.  I was then assigned a salesman who would be waiting for me when I arrived.  When we arrived, I checked in at the front desk and the salesman Nasser was summoned.  Nasser was very knowledgeable about the model we were interested in and was able to answer all of our concerns and detailed questions about the cars features.  Very impressive indeed.  Once we found the prefect car Nasser handed us off to Yasmine in finance.   Once again, our expectations were exceeded.  After we signed the paperwork, Nasser gave me a detailed introduction to all the cars features.  He knew the car like the back of his hand.  All said and done from the time I contacted the chat, drove 1:15 minutes to Newport Lexus, test drove, signed the paperwork, got acquainted with my car, the total time was 4 hours 30 minutes!!!  Fantastic!  That is only about 3 hours at the dealer to find the car and roll away.  So nice.

Even during the brief wait for finance, we got to sit in the lounge which was very comfortable and relaxing with leather sofas and a small cafe.    Overall A++.  ",5.0

Elizabeth was quick to respond, letting me know that the vehicle was in stock & available for purchase. When I arrived I was promptly greeted by Kamran, my sales consultant. He helped me get the car that I wanted and took care of my trade. The great service continued in to the finance office, where Matt helped me get in and out of finance in a timely manner.

536,"January 22, 2017","I take a long time to purchase or in this case lease an automobile. I first met Jorge Urquidez about 2 years ago and would chat with him from time to time. I had purchased an RX350 from another salesman previously at Newport Lexus and I flat did not like the RX350 even though I drove it for 5 yrs. I was impressed with Jorge each time I talked with him and I am sure I drove him ""batty"" with the times that I spent with him in trying to make up my mind what I was going to do. Finally, he closed with me on a car which I picked up yesterday. He is a young guy that is very polite and sticks to his customer not giving up on the potential that he see with someone. I will definitely try to do business with him again assuming that I continue enjoying my relationship with Newport Lexus. I also deal with Joey Wilchek whom I also think is very professional and I love to do business with them both.
Thats my story.

My first encounter with Steve was my initial phone call to Newport Lexus regarding a particular RX350.  He was very congenial and professional on the phone call and we set up a time to come look at the car.  When I came to the dealership, Steve greeted us and showed us the car we called about.  He was very informative about the car and I could tell that he was well versed on the RX350.  Steve then showed us other RX350s that were much like the one we called about.  What I really appreciated is he pointed out the different advantages of purchasing the different vehicles.  I told Steve that I wanted to talk to my wife about the cars and he was sensitive to the fact that I wanted to talk to her privately.  I knew that he was available if we had any questions.  We asked Steve a few more questions and told him that we wanted to go home and talk more about the different vehicles.  He did not give us a feeling of being pressured to buy right away.
When we decided on what RX350 we wanted, we called him and set up a time to purchase it the next morning.  Unfortunately my wife came down with a serious infection and had to go to the ER and we were unable to make out appointment.  We called Steve to cancel our appointment. He was very understanding and concerned regarding by wife's health.  Steve contacted us the next day to see how my wife was doing and said nothing about the purchase of the car.  That showed me that he was concerned about us as individuals and not just a sale.
When my wife got better a few days later, we came in and purchased a RX350.  The whole process of purchasing the car was smooth and pleasant.  Steve pointed out the super 161 point preparation that goes into buying a Lexus.  I felt he kept a personal eye on how well our car was prepared for delivery.  Steve went over the different aspects of our RX350 and we drove off feeling confident we were familiar with our car and that we had a pleasant experience.
My wife and I feel that Steve Tibbetts is an excellent representative of Newport Lexus.  After all, I feel that a company is only as good as the individuals that make it up and represent it.  Steve Tibbetts is a definite asset to Newport Lexus.

 I was helping her with her car purchase and couldn't have been happier with her car buying experience with Greg Brawley at Newport Lexus (or, more disgusted with Roger Mehr at MV Lexus)!

We checked Newport Lexus' website, and, after prompt/awesome service online chatting (via Newport Lexus website) with Rosa for some further info, I was contacted by online manager Jeff Locastro, who was very patient and incredibly helpful as well. 
Jeff turned me over to Greg Brawley to set up an appt. and Greg couldn't have carried out his job better. I'm a firm believer in doing every job to the best of your ability, and Greg was a prime example of just that. 
He answered every question thoroughly, spoke slowly and clearly to accommodate my aunt and never made her feel pressured to make a decision or buy. In comparison to other (luxury) dealerships and overall car buying experience, Greg's kindness, knowledge, patience, and helpfulness is unparalleled. 
My aunt was very satisfied with the purchase of her new Lexus NX 200t from Greg and even happier with his straightforwardness, patience, and helpfulness. 

Yasmine Aref was also very patient and friendly, making the financial portion of the day more tolerable!

716,"September 02, 2016","I will no longer be taking my car into Newport Lexus for services. There have been a lot of scattered issues over the several times I have taken my car in for service. The price increase for an oil change from $100 to $135 is the last straw. 

- I was told it would be about 1.5 hours for an oil change. Dealership said they would call me when it was ready, and I walked to get some lunch. Came back after a little over 2 hours, and my car was sitting in the lot ready. Would have been nice to get a call when my car was done so I could get my car back earlier. 

- Received a 'low engine oil' alert a few months after getting oil changed at dealership. There was still about 1 month before I needed my next oil change. 

- Had a pair of sunglasses stolen out of my car

- One time my car was somehow lost in their system and they were unable to physically locate my car. Eventually they found my car, but I had to wait a while to get it back. They made up for it with a full tank of gas, but the overall experience was irritating. 

- I used to justify the high price of the oil change because of the loaner car. They no longer offer a loaner for oil changes, so there really isn't much of a difference between the dealership and a mechanic.

749,"August 05, 2016","
This was the worst experience I have ever had.  I went to pick up the car that was confirmed in email of day and time to be picked up. 20 minutes before I was to arrive, I got a call that they sold it and no apology.  Just that they were having another car sent but it wouldn't be ready til the next day.  They inconvenienced me and expected me to drop everything. 

I went to the dealership.  Fred's answer to why did you sell it when you knew I was coming was ""I have to sell 400 cars a month.""  I said ""so my business isn't important?""  His response -""ma'am, I have 400 cars to sell a month.""  

Sales 101 - listen to the customer, let them vent and then try to make it right not argue with them and say absurd things like you have 400 cars to sell.  I walked out and the GM responded to my email and voicemail but I realized I never got an I'm sorry for the way his management acted.  I also have email to backup the communication around this sale.  

I'm embarrassed for them the way that this was handled and I have also contacted corporate Lexus.   I was going to let this stay under the radar until my friend was contacted by Yelp that her review of what she witnessed while she was with me was removed because Newport Lexus didn't want the review there. Here is my review based on my experience.  Take it for what it's worth but Fred was horrible in his actions and behaviors and did not treat me well.  Had they taken responsibility - I wouldn't be posting this.

Update:  Thank you Tony for the response.  As I mentioned when we talked, I was told I did not have to have the financials done until I picked up the car.  I forwarded you that email that stated that even though I tried to submit them on Sunday, July 24th when both Lexus and I agreed on the terms of sale - I was told Thursday would be fine when I picked up the car.  

Let me clarify that this review was not about the fact that the car was sold before I got there, but this review is about the way I was treated by Fred.  Had he apologized for what happened and not said the absurd comment of selling 400 cars a month - I would have still purchased the car.  At the end of the day, it was the way I was treated not that the car was sold.  ",2.0

During this visit, my battery was still under warranty, so they replaced it and washed my Lexus while I enjoyed waiting in their very comfortable lounge area.

795,"June 21, 2016","Came here recently for a test drive.  Not sure why, but this sales guy just wasn't interested in letting us get on the freeway (the dealership is only 2 blocks from the 73 Freeway, FYI, and no, it wasn't rush hour).  We went maybe a couple miles on surface streets, going no more than 45 mph because of traffic and red lights.  How is anyone supposed to know whether they like a car's performance going THAT slow?  I was bored to tears on this test drive and left very disappointed.  The guy also had this look on his face like he didn't think we were serious, even though we had every intention of buying a car that day if the car, the experience and the deal were right.  In this instance, both were just miserable (although, to clarify, Michael was actually a nice guy otherwise).

In the end, we ended up buying a car from Fletcher Jones MB instead.  Visiting both dealerships made us realize just how superior Fletcher Jones is to Newport Lexus.  The salesman we did a test drive with at FJ had  a lot of energy and enthusiasm, even though it was after 7pm and was probably beginning to wrap up his workday.  When we test drove out of the dealership, he immediately asked us to get on the freeway (unlike Newport Lexus).  As soon as we got on the 73 Fwy, a CHP cruiser passed us.  The salesman told us to ""punch it"" and speed past the police officer so we could test the performance of the car.  We thought he was joking and didn't do it for fear of getting a ticket, but he later told us he was serious because FJMB pays so much in taxes to the city that the CHP does not pull over anyone for speeding if they are doing a Fletcher Jones test drive.  I LOVE THAT!  100x better and WAY more enjoyable experience than at Newport Lexus, hands down.  Drove off the lot with that Mercedes-Benz that night.

870,"March 31, 2016","After many years of owning a Lexus, I was hoping for a continued relationship, but of course I was skeptical of how the sale would go.  Fortunately Gary Kalagian made it as effortless as possible!  His calm demeanor and straight forward approach is exactly what I needed to help me through the process.  Everyone at the dealership was kind and helpful. Jackie who made my appointment, was most ready to accommodate my schedule and made sure that I received information quickly and efficiently, even when I had to reschedule.  Also, she called me today (the day after purchase) to make sure I was happy with my experience.
Gary was open about himself as a person, but not overbearing like many sales reps can get.  I'm very impressed by Newport Lexus and their desire to make the customer feel happy with the purchase even through I've been an owner for years and know the quality to expect.  They still treated me as if I was a first time buyer.

Elizabeth Locastro handled my initial calls and was the liaison with Greg. Nice lady.

Greg Brawley was really responsive. I requested pics via email and he sent them immediately. When I arrived and felt like the car didn't suit me, he didn't try and pressure me into something else. As it turned out, I saw another car on my own and was extremely helpful getting the deal done with price and making sure my golf clubs would fit!

Greg Lawson in finance was also very helpful and answered my questions along with some good advice. The paper work took no more than 45 min. Awesome!

This is a little nit-picky, but the reason for 4 stars instead of 5 was the barista girl acted like she was doing me a favor. Maybe she was having a bad day.

I did not like the models that were being offered to me until I was introduced to the Lexus CT200h F Sport. The engineering of the car is incredible, but the sales associate and accounting lady were very pushy. When I told them I would return on another date because paperwork wasn't adding up, they essentially promised me a quick speedy processing that day, and a check for my trade in-vehicle in two weeks. Well, 20 mins turned into 4 hours which caused me to miss a very important meeting. I purchased my vehicle on October 23rd, 2015. It is now December 4th, 2015 and still no check. Had it not been for Bill Pippin making me feel more at ease, I probably would have written to corporate and the city of Newport with a much more detailed complaint. Customers should receive what they are promised or the loyalty and trust is not there, neither is returning or referred business. The car is great, but the service has been the worst. I took my car in for its first wash a week ago and I wasn't even directed on where to go, where to sit, how long it would take, etc. Something Fletcher Jones would NEVER tolerate with their team.

I left that day not getting a car, but told him I would be back with my wife. 

I took that night to looking around to check all of the dealers inventory and found a white with black interior at another dealership. I was tempted just to go down the other dealer and start the process again there. Needless to say I did not and went back to Eddy because of the service and the time he spent with me going over my many options. A few days later I showed up with wife to let her choose the color. She ended up on a brand new White and tan RX 350 and has not regretted her one bit. It is a great car, even if I have only been in it once since we got it. 

With so many dealer options around me I could have went to 5 or 6 different places to get the car for my wife. But I am so glad I went to Newport Lexus. The experience of buying the RX was hands down the best dealership buying experience I have ever had. And that even includes MB dealers. 

The time Eddy spent with my wife going over all of the details of the cars was a great plus. And I can't forget... The bow!! 

Paul in the finance department was also great and thoroughly explain my options while keeping the process moving. Paper work is never fun, but he kept things going while still making it a personal experience. 

I can't say enough about my experience, I will definitely be back.

940,"November 02, 2015","This was my second purchase experience at Newport Lexus, and this purchase was even better than the first - the first of which already set a high bar. From start to finish, I was treated with respect as a client, and not a quick commission to get through the gate like some other dealerships are notorious for. Both Gary and Sarah were extremely knowledgeable about their product and were able to address all of my questions and concerns.

As for the facility, it is top notch. When time came to buy the car I was looking at, I had no choice but to bring my family (two young boys) with me. While the showroom is pure class, make no mistake - it is totally practical from a young family's perspective. There was an area with a train table, as well as a (free) arcade room that was practically sound-proof.  As parents that are cognizant of just how loud and impatient kids can get sitting around, this was a total relief and the boys had a great time. In fact, they've since asked if they can go back!

Lastly, pricing was completely transparent and fair for the CPO vehicle I was looking at.  Negotiations were straight-forward and low pressure. I was provided with a total line-by-line itemized sheet.  In short, best purchase experience I've ever had.

You can't go wrong with Gary and Sarah at Newport Lexus. AAA-rated.",5.0
941,"October 31, 2015","I have been purchasing cars at dealerships for the last 13yrs. First impression, the Newport Beach Lexus store is by far one of the most impressive in so cal. Too many features to mention.  My favorite was the putting green, right next to Gary's office. 

I was referred to Gary by a family member. Gary was very informative, professional, friendly and a ""no pressure"" sales rep. He presented us multiple car options that fit within our budget, once again, at no point did I feel any pressure to buy. The numbers just made sense for us to get an 2015 RX350 with all of the features we were looking for. We arrived around 6:30pm on a Friday night, he never rushed us, still showed us several models, and highlighted all of the features on each one. 

I strongly recommend working with Gary, he has been the stores top salesmen for the past 6+yrs, and I understand why. Thank you so much Gary for the great buying experience. In my wife's words ""That was the easiest buying experience ever"". This is my 2nd lexus purchase and it's not our last. I will be sending Gary all of my referrals, and will back to work with Gary when I am ready to purchase and upgrade my IS250. 

I can't thank you enough; you made our first family vehicle dreams come true. Between you and Andres Guerrero in Service, you have earned my business for life. ",5.0

954,"October 17, 2015","This is my second review here for Newport Lexus. They are absolutely the No.1 Lexus Dealership in Southern California. 
 I got a 2015 NX200T F Sport about 3 months ago. Unfortunately, I got into a deadly accident and totaled my car. The NX did such a wonderful job protecting me. Both the doctor and my insurance person think it is a miracle that I walk out of the car intact. 
I love my old car so much. When Triple A put me in touch with Shooter at Newport Lexus, I had no second thought but to get the same car. Shooter made my whole purchase experience so smooth and seamless. The price is just as fair as my first NX. Because I lost my car, he even picked me up all the way from Claremont to Newport which is a 2-3 hour drive round way!!
 I couldn't be happier that now I have the exact same car back. This is the best consolation for my accident. I love my new car even more and everyday, I drive with care and full attention. NX is very popular that most other dealers around the area were using aggressive sales techniques which had made me feel rather uncomfortable. However, in 3 months, I was able to get two NX from Newport with just the best service and best price. You know the difference when you are working with the best dealership. 
 I truly appreciate the world class service and honest, trustworthy and warm sales people at Newport Lexus.Trust me, if you live in SoCal, there are no other places you should consider for a Lexus except Newport Lexus. ",5.0

As a result he made it possible for us to get into a new NX at a cost we felt comfortable with.  The NX is so much fun to drive.  Furthermore, Jorge's part doesn't end there.

When I started to shop around for my perfect car, I didn't even have Lexus in mind until I saw and sat in the IS250. Then I knew that's the car I wanted, but I had to find the perfect deal. I visited numerous Lexus dealerships, but nothing compares to the selection and service at Newport Lexus! When you pull up to this massive fancy dealership, you immediately think $$$$$$$$$$, but I can't say this enough, they have great deals- trust me I did my homework. 
I had been directed to Jorge when I called the dealership prior to coming in. He set up an appointment that worked with my schedule and was ready as soon as I pulled up with my family. He listens to what you want, what you can afford, and does not try to sell you any product that you don't want or need. Once we picked the car and test drove it, we began talking numbers and everything fell into place. Newport Lexus got us a great rate for financing and before we knew it, I was the owner of an IS!

969,"September 17, 2015","Mike Shimon was awesome.  This is my first Lexus purchase with him, although I have bought several others in the past.  He made it happen.  Partially because Newport Lexus has such a high volume of business, that they can get deals done where it is impossible at other dealers.  I had an IS that I didn't love, and really wanted to get into a GS again, and Mike was tenacious in talking with ""his people"" until we put together a deal that made sense.  

And I hate to say it, but some car salespeople still talk to the man in the relationship over the woman, even though the man is not making the decision.  Mike did not do that.  So he got points for that too. 

And the dealership itself is really beautiful!  Very luxurious.

1023,"July 27, 2015","People like Mike and Bobby are the ones who create the positive divide between a ""sales"" based environment and a ""customer service"" experience. The difference being, wanting to purchase a vehicle out of pressure, or being given the choice to walk out with a purchase fitting to the personal ideal you walked into the dealership with. 

An incredible amount of transparency was displayed from the moment I initially shook hands until the moment I drove off in my new Lexus.

Moral of the story, from Bobby Sento in management to Mike Shimon in sales, the emotional and physical transparency of these individuals created an experience worth reliving over and over again. The attention to detail and transparent nature of these two embody the ideal of a ""red-carpet"" experience. 

Not only did Mike go into great depth for almost an hour explaining each function of the vehicle even AFTER it was purchased, but he also made sure to preserve customer retention value by including personal ownership stories of his own and made it overall personable and enjoyable to learn all about the car. He put himself in my position as a new car buyer and was equally excited to cover every detail.

1026,"July 27, 2015","My husband and I knew, after visiting many other Lexus dealerships, when we walked into Newport Lexus and met Gary that this was they type of dealership and sales person we wanted to do business with. From start to finish the whole experience was very comfortable and enjoyable. Gary took it upon himself to go over ALL of the cars features with us so we could make an educated discussion on if this was the car for us or not. We researched the car online, had been to other Lexus dealerships, and test driven it multiple times, however we learned more from Gary about the car than everything else combined. No other sales person had taken the time to educate us to the full extent that Gary did. Flash forward to the paper work and buying process, we did not feel the least bit pressured, in fact Gary genuinely wanted to make sure this was a good fit for us. He even told us that if we weren't 100% happy and comfortable with the car that he would keep his eye out for us and find one that is, ""I don't care if you buy tonight or in a year, I will see you through the whole process and make sure you end up getting the car that you're 100% happy with"". That, amongst many other things, really spoke volumes to my husband and me. Gary is not your run of the mill high pressure car sales man, he is the complete opposite! You can tell he has a passion for what he does and genuinely wants to see people happy. He not only gave us EXCEPTIONAL service while we were there but he gave us his personal cell number and told us that he is our Lexus guy from now on, if we need a service, have trouble figuring out the navigation, or anything at all to give him a call and he will help us out. I don't know about you but I have never had a sales person be so dedicated even AFTER they get the sale. I could go on all day about how pleased we were/are with our service at Newport Lexus but the bottom line is, Gary is  phenomenal and Newport Lexus is THE place to purchase your Lexus. We feel grateful to have stumbled into Newport Lexus and even more grateful that Gary was ""our guy! ",5.0

1042,"July 14, 2015","The reason I chose to purchase my first IS 250 at Newport Lexus was because of these factors:

-The Salesman was very knowledgeable about the car and its features.
-The trade-in offer for my particular car was very acceptable.  
-The car I had purchased contained all the features I requested.  
-The financing process of the car was also very fast and simple.

-After the sale of the car I sill received the best support from the salesman regarding any question.  
-Overall the whole process was very fast and professional.

1052,"July 01, 2015","Let me start by saying there are few things I hate more than purchasing a car.  I hate the wheeling and dealing.  Some people might like it, but it gives me anxiety. I must have spoken to a dozen ""internet sales managers"" on the phone and time after time it was one sleazy sales pitch after another. I even had to switch my car selection because of it. I think I am like most people, I just didn't want to get ripped off.

This is the information age. People can do a quick google and find out what people are paying in minutes. There is no reason for the song and dance anymore....and yet the madness continues. 

Working with Eddy was a different experience than what I was expecting.  Eddie did not shy away from talking about what I researched on the car forums and in fact, he embraced it..  He even educated me quite a bit more than what I managed to pick up online. When closing on our deal I am happy to say I was completely at ease with my decision to purchase. Nothing was a surprise and a couple days later after some hindsight research I still feel I made the absolute right decision. 

The whole transaction was pretty quick, and the most time spent was really figuring out what car was right for me.  At no point was I pressured and I especially liked that he didn't try to push options on me I did not want. 

His initial quote was nearly dead on.  I took a day to think it over and shop the price (it was my first Lexus visit). When I left he said he knew I would be back because he new his numbers were good.   I did price a check it and most dealers simply gave up. Internet forums said it was an amazing deal. 

No song and dance.  I think i waited a whole 10 minutes to get my price approved.  I believe the whole transaction from the time i first showed up to getting my keys took a total of 4 hours (over two days).  

Eddy Lin did an excellent job and I enthusiastically recommend you come talk to him. 


Sarah Engel the Finance manager was also great. She very kind, communicates clearly when outlining all the complicated details and very patient.

Really a great experience from the time I walked in until I drove away in my new car!

1053,"June 30, 2015","Chris approached my wife and me outside before we even got inside. We had a special we saw online in our mind and Chris showed us the cars immediately. After we set our mind on the particular color, he brought the car to us (no need walking back and forth), politely explained the key specifics of the car (it's a hybrid) and allowed me to sit at the front passenger seat (rather than sit there himself, like many dealers do). 
He helped us to get the deal we were looking for, given that our credit wasn't optimal for the promotional deal. 
Anyways, Chris wasn't pushy and let us think a day. Finally when we made our mind on the car, he was able to sweeten up the deal even better, work some exceptional procedures on the paper signing (co-signer was in different city) for free, got our car all ready and even picked my wife up to bring her to the dealership for car delivery.

1074,"June 02, 2015","I had previously purchased a Toyota Camry for my daughter from David Blumenthal at South Coast Toyota and had a remarkable experience.  So, when I wanted to get a Lexus for my wife, I turned to David who sent me to Newport Lexus.  There I dealt with a team of people (Craig Jones, Bobby Sento, Mark Marino and Sarah Engel) who are indescribably superb at their occupation.  Mark helped us out with test driving and selecting a vehicle knowing his product inside and out.  Then Craig helped us through the rest of the process, guiding us through what is often a stressful experience with a minimum of hassle.  Bobby Sento oversaw everything helping us with pricing and options, and Sarah Engel made the paperwork a breeze.  The facility they work in is like a country club and is a nice place to be, let alone buy a car.

I can say, without hesitation or any reservation, the experience was a pleasure.  These guys are so good at what they do that I will go back again and again for any vehicle I may want in the future (or maybe just to hang out for a soda and say hi).  In a world of impersonal transactions, they made us feel special and cared for.  Don’t even think of going somewhere else.

This policy is on the dealership, not Sangjae. This new policy breaks the mindset of decades that there is SOME room to negotiate on a vehicle. When a salesperson tells you the dealer no longer negotiates on the price would you believe them? This new policy puts the salesperson at a disadvantage as you don't believe them.

Sangjae overcame this with his calm and positive nature. I pushed back very hard on this policy and Sangjae took all my ""feedback"" in stride. He stayed positive & focused on getting me into the car he knew I wanted. 

This new policy made me consider not shopping with Newport Lexus ever again. However, Sangjae overcame this and has earned my family's business today & in the future.

I am sincerely appreciative of all of his hardwork and help. He took care of every facet of the sale.

Have been to other Lexus dealers such as Mission Viejo and Jim Falk in Beverly Hills, and they were high pressure and didn't have the selection of Newport Beach. I especially want to commend Bob Minton as he immediately understood my needs and met them without games or excuses. He tells it like it is and I recommend anyone considering a new or used Lexus to seek out Bob at NBL. I'm also telling my friends considering a new car to get a Lexus from him. ",5.0
1132,"April 03, 2015","I'm so glad I ended up here finally. For months before I shopped around because choosing a car to purchase is right up there with choosing a spouse. Other dealerships are nightmares - I felt like I needed to enter the witness protection program to stop the incessant calls! I dreaded having to do the rounds again. I narrowed down my choices and saw that Newport Lexus had the exact car I wanted. I showed up at 8:45PM thinking there would definitely be some eye rolling that I came at the very last minute. But Jorge was just strolling along and had no problem giving me a test drive right as they were closing up shop. He didn't pressure me for my info or try to sell me hard...he thought I was just test driving. Well...I decided to buy the car. They gave me a really truly good deal (a week later I was still checking just to make sure I had indeed gotten a good price). Anyways we closed the shop down...and as it was 12AM Jorge offered to bring the car to my house and have me sign the papers there. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE CAR (RX450h) and anytime I have questions Jorge is very responsive to answering me via text. Poor guy - I text him about random things I could easily find in the owner's manual...but he really knows his stuff. I mean the SALES guy ACTUALLY KNOWS WHAT HE IS TALKING ABOUT (unlike on another OC Lexus sales floor). Their standard line is that ""everyone is family"" and while that's a little too cheesy for me to get behind - what I do have to say is they go above and beyond to provide excellent customer service  (EVEN AFTER THE SALE!!!!). They've got a class act operation going there and I've been impressed with everyone. That's it. ",5.0

Craig’s product knowledge and overall expertise on Lexus products was extremely helpful in making the right decision on the best car for her needs.
We looked at all the color combos available, but the one we really wanted wasn’t available on the lot.   Craig explained that he would do everything possible to locate the exact vehicle that I wanted through their internal dealership inventory system.  Craig was able to locate the exact combination we wanted and had the car delivered to Newport Beach within as few hours.  Exceptional service! 
I then worked with Sales Manager, Bobby Sento, and was able to negotiate a great price on the vehicle and the trade-in.    It was such a pleasure dealing with someone as professional, knowledgeable and accommodating as Bobby…it really made the car buying experience a pleasure.
Lastly, I dealt with Greg Lawson in the Finance Department and his service was equally exceptional.  Greg was thorough while moving the paperwork along quickly. He explained the lease program as well as the various product and services available for our vehicle.  I decided to purchase the ding and scratch removal package and got in and out of Finance very quickly.  
The vehicle was ready and waiting for us when we finished the paperwork and Craig gave us a very detailed and informative tutorial on all of the features and functionality of the car.

I was lucky enough to work with Jorge Urquidez, who not only guided me through the process, but he did so with a positive attitude and passion for all that is Newport Beach Lexus.  I was originally on the wait list for the new NX but with Jorge and Scott Young's assistance I was able to drive off the lot with the new 2015 RX350--all of this and they took care of trading in my Mercedes GLK350 as well.

Jorge exemplifies many things: he's honest, patient and ethical, his communication skills are above reproach, his sense of humor, confidence and commitment to his job is evident by his hardworking energy and creative intuition.  Jorge's knowledge and enthusiasm is infectious...his exceptional service and follow-through has won me over and I plan on referring all my friends (and many Mercedes Benz owners) over to Jorge!

The first purchase was so smooth and I loved the car (RX), but what brought me back to Newport Lexus was the dealership itself.  It is so pleasant to be there, so calm and quiet.  Free car washes are a pleasure as you can hang out in its nice environment, get some work done or watch TV while enjoying a bite at the cafe.  Getting the car serviced is simple as they get you in and out and on your way with your nice loaner vehicle so that you don't lose downtime.  There isn't the factory-like environment and long waits in uncomfortable waiting rooms you find at most car dealerships.  We looked around at several comparable car makes just to do our due diligence but no car dealership we found can compare to Newport Lexus and no car could beat what we found for the price.

Jorge was knowledgeable and helpful as well as patient as my family made the choice of the perfect vehicle for us.  We ended up with a GX which I absolutely love.

1191,"November 21, 2014","Working with the team at Newport Lexus was a real pleasure. Everyone is very friendly, and from the moment you walk through the door you feel welcome. Jorge knows his stuff, and really helped me with finding the exact car I wanted and getting it set up. Bobby worked with me on the lease terms and made the numbers work exactly how I needed them to. Greg was incredibly informative with the extras packages, which led me to adding the cilajet, door ding protection, and tire/wheel package. When I drove my new car off the lot, I couldn't have been happier. I'll never buy a new car from anyone else!! Thank you guys very much, and I look forward to working with you in the future! ",5.0

1194,"October 31, 2014","I love my new car!!!  It was a great experience.  I didn't feel pressured and didn't get the typical ""car salesman"" approach.  Mike Shimon was very informative and efficient.  He had the answers to all of my questions.  He was persistent but not pushy.  He followed up with emails and when I was finally ready to move forward with purchasing a car, it was a no-stress process.  I did go to other dealerships in my quest to finding the right car for me, and I'll admit because of the service, pleasant staff and signature awards, I returned to Newport Lexus.  A big aloha to Scott Young as well for his service :)",4.8
1195,"October 30, 2014","I didn't walk in to Newport Lexus to buy a car, I went in for technical information about the four wheel drive operating system on the GX 470. Craig Jones gave me the info I needed and showed me a Certified pre-owned 470 on the floor. One hour later, it was mine. The lexus Pre-Owned Program, the price, along with the condition of the SUV and the professional non-pressure conversation with Craig sold me.

1198,"October 23, 2014","I initiated contact via an online chat. Eddy followed up with me during regular business hours the following day and we made arrangements to meet up after I was off work. We took a quick look at the ES350 in the trim we wanted but had already made up our mind. For me, we just had to agree on a price. I'm work in finance and had done my homework so I appreciated Eddy's straight forward and transparent approach. I was happy with the sale price. The only downside of the experience was the less than appealing offer for our trade-in. We decided to sell it ourselves. With a price, residual, money factor and fee's/doc costs all sorted we met with Scott to finish up the deal. This was a smooth process and I enjoyed the fact that he didn't push the extras too hard. A simple ""no thanks"" was all that was needed. Now that the paperwork was done it was time for some pictures with the new car. My wife loved the pictures with the bow. Some may find it a bit cheesy but we thought it was a nice touch. Eddy finished up with a quick walkthrough and helped sync up her phone. We drove home in style, happy with our new car and satisfied with the buying experience. I would happily refer friends and family to Newport Lexus.",4.4

1200,"October 10, 2014","I am from Rancho Mirage, California, and had a dismal experience close to my home at Desert Lexus prior to coming to Newport Lexus.  I called Newport Lexus to say I'd be coming on a Sunday at 1:30 pm.  And then, I met extraordinary sales professional, Mark Marino!  Mark was superlative in delivering everything I wished to accomplish in a very complicated three-part transaction.  (1) I needed to turn in my recently deceased husband's 2012 Lexus still under lease; (2) I wanted to sell my 2011 Jaguar XJL Super still under monthly purchase; (3) I wished to obtain a new black with parchment interior Lexus ES350 at a considerably lower monthly lease rate than my Jag was costing me.

Mark greeted me warmly and spoke of the loss of my wonderful husband.  He listened patiently while I explained my goals for the above-mentioned complicated transaction.  He met every requirement for professionalism, and was confident that Newport Lexus could accommodate my needs.  And he did.  He also walked me through the process with the financial team after we struck a deal.  Moreover, Mark drove my new Lexus (having been coated with the ""special sauce"") down to Rancho Mirage.  He spent nearly an hour in the car educating me on the amazing features of the Lex, and watched while I learned, guiding me each step of the way.  Then, after I most gratefully bought him dinner, Mark drove my 2011 Jaguar back to Newport for resale. 

I love my new Lexus.  I was and am completely convinced I got a fair deal.  I am incredibly pleased with the kindness and expertise of Mark Marino.  I will recommend him-- and Newport Lexus-- to my friends every opportunity I get.  I will also tell the car jockeys at my club what a great deal I got from Newport Lexus.",4.8
1201,"October 06, 2014","We had a 10 year old IS 300 that we lived, but it was time for a new car. We worked with Gary Kalagian and couldn't have had a better experience. Gary was super patient with us as we went back and forth with our decision. We finally decided on a car, and he worked hard and quickly found us the exact car we wanted. It was delivered from another dealership from Riverside, and when we took delivery, the car was perfect. Gary took a lot of extra time to not only walk us through the car's features, but he helped us setup all the new technology features in the car to our preference. The best part was that Gary was never pushy with us, never lost patience with us, and assured us that our relationship doesn't end with the purchase, but that he would be there to help us with the car throughout it's life.  We're thrilled to have our new CT200h and we're looking forward to our next Lexus. No doubt we will be working with Gary again. ",5.0

1204,"October 01, 2014","My husband and I first went into Newport Lexus, we live in Newport and had high hopes that were lowered quickly when we met with Abe, he not only was very hostile he was not very helpful. I had a make and model in mind and he did not want to do any leg work to locate one, he just wanted to sell what was on the lot. When I explained to him that I was not interested in those he became very hostile and annoyed that we were even there. We ended up leaving.  

I then explained this to Howard, a nice, helpful internet manager who said that he DID have the make and model coming in on Sunday. So I arranged childcare (this is not easy for me) so I could come in only to find out that the car he said that I wanted was sold a week prior. He could of called me!?!? But no it was just a way to get my husband and I to come back in person. But Howard is does not even handle sales so we were handed off to Chris. Chris was nice, but constantly ""mis-spoke"" about facts about the cars he had to which we had to reconfirm and correct him. He did have the make and model of the car I wanted, he said it was a 2015, we started to talk pricing and we agreed to a price, I just off hand confirmed again this is a 2015 - he then said oh wait no this is a 2014. I then explained to him that we are not willing to pay the same amount for the 2015 as 2014. I do not know if he tried to save face with his manager and not inform them of his mistake, but all of a sudden the price was firm since this car was in high demand. OH and also the car had ugly chrome wheels to which Chris wanted us to pay $2000 for - I was like can't you just switch them out?!?! We walked out.  We were very disappointed with the customer relations at this dealer.

The silver lining is that I went to Lexus Mission Viejo and bought the car I wanted with the price I wanted, it was easy and they were really friendly. Word of mouth is everything......",1.3

I had stopped at Walter's and had a great price on a new S 550, but I really didn't want to spend that much right now.  I couldn't find Fletcher Jones and when I saw Newport Lexus, I decided to stop and see what they had.  I asked for Shooter and he showed me the Pre-owned Certified and there was one that cought my eye.  More miles than I wanted lbut the color and everything else was right, including the financing at .9%.  Shooter was right there with me all the way and I felt very good about the deal he got for me.  His manager Bill  ??? was a class guy, who when he couldn't go any further, he came and told me and I agree immediately on his final offer.

Time will tell as to my Lexus experience, but my early guess is I'll be back in a couple of years stepping up to a new one.  You have a beautiful and impressive facility, very classy people, and a great Brand.

1254,"August 11, 2014","I'm located in Arizona and found the vehicle I wanted online in Newport, CA.  When I called the dealership I spoke with Gary and he was extremely helpful.  Being that I was out of town, this was a unique transaction doing everything by phone and email.  However Gary was knowledgeable about the out of state buying process and was able to guide me through the entire deal.  Unlike other car salesmen, working with Gary I didn't feel any pressure to buy the vehicle or come pick it up by any specific date.  Which is exactly how it should be when you're making a decision like this.  After completing my purchase, Gary followed up with me twice to see how I'm settling into my car.  WOW!!!! This is almost unheard of anymore these days...  I would definitely recommend Gary Kalagian to anyone for their future vehicle purchase.    ",5.0

Selecting and buying your next vehicle can be challenging.  I was fortunate to have found Gary.   To call Gary a salesperson would do him injustice.  Working with Gary has been like having my own trusted car advisor who is wiling and ready to assist me with all my needs.  He was there to assist me when I was looking to select a vehicle and has been there for me even after I purchased the vehicle.  He is just a phone call away for anything I need and gets i done for me.  

Thank you for everything you do

Aside from it's beautiful looks, you get many great benefits when buying from Newport Lexus.

More importantly, they are straight forward in their negotiating and you won't have to go through the ""games"" to get a good deal.

I never anticipated being treated as a valued customer, in an unexpected 5 star hotel environment AND achieving an excellent price on the exact vehicle of my choice.

The competitor couldn't even tell me what year the car was first manufactured, and it went downhill from there including no after purchase amenities.  

At Newport Lexus, Jeff and Mike were extremely knowledgable about every aspect of my car of choice.  They both made it clear that they would be there for us as long as we needed to educate us in the operation and understanding of the many sophisticated aspects of this vehicle.  They even educated us as to the hybrid technology used and it's long running history.  Mike's anecdotes made the learning process more pertinent and palatable.

Some of the most unprofessional people I ever met and I've met a few.  They blamed their decision to sell because we hadn't come to an agreement.  Well, I shook hands with the sales manager, Christopher Senesac, they have the key to my trade which we also agreed to on pricing.  Not owning up to your mistake is intolerable.  Sure they try to find us another car, over 30miles away.  Still they insisted that we sign documents.  Who in their right mind would buy a car on paper after they pull a stunt like that?  

Newport Lexus can keep their cars.  I have owned Toyota for nearly 3 decades and have been a long supporter of their vehicles.  The pretentious sales people and managers at Newport Lexus are ruining my ownership experience.  I for one will take precaution the next time I have to buy a car.  Regardless, I now put Newport Lexus in the ranks of used car dealerships.",1.0

1326,"June 29, 2013","Horrible experience.
I bought  a new Lexus IS250 in Newport in 2009, also we bought additional 5years tire insurance there the same day. After that, we did every single maintenance there without suspecting anything.
The last maintenance there I was done on 01/16/2013, which is 25,000miles. I was told everything is perfect. Four and half months later (June 6), my car got huge noise from my tires when I was driving  on freeway. I parked the car and call roadside assistance, and they can't even disassemble my tire since there was a long rubber/metal strip from the tire tangling on the wheels, so they have to tow the car to the dealer.
The service manager checked the car, found that both front tires had the damage, then I was told that I need to buy two new tires because my tires were NATUALLY WORN OUT. I can't agree with that since it was only four and half month/3500 miles after my last maintenance done there, and there was no problem based on them. Tires NATUALLY worn out can't be happened suddenly. Either it was caused by car misalignment they didn't find last time, or it was road hazard which the tires insurance should cover. However, they insist that it was NATURALLY WORN OUT.
Then I bought tires from Costco and did alignment check/alignment in Firestone. Based on the visual inspection and measurement they performed, my car had misalignment problem and the tire unevenness was VERY obvious and not happened within 3500miles.
I called Newport, they insist that it was not their responsibility. They insist that they performed tire check and it was even and 5mm above in Jan which was good. And they said that when I towed the car in, it became 3mm BELOW, should be my own problem. But the truth is: even when the accident happened, outside of both front tires were still very new(should be more than 5mm above) while the inner side of both front tires got serious damaged (should be much more than 3mm BELOW). I didn't feel any unusual during these four months, and all my four wheels are good without even scratch. I can't understand why they decided a such UNEVENESS tires as naturally worn out. And I can't believe why they didn't inspect my tires (though they said they did). 
When I called in pretended that I am a new customer, they will assure me how wonderful their service is, and they will definitely check tires unevenness every time etc....DON'T TRUST THEM. But when I told them my situation, they will change immediately, said SERVICE MANAGER's decision is the final decision!
Their neglect out me into dangerous, and I will never use their service again. 
STAY AWAY FROM NEWPORT, don't buy any additional services they provide, premium price will not make you worry-free there!
They make me feel that it was my big mistake to buy Lexus from them and used their service for almost four years. BTW, my car is still under warranty, and I still kept my two front tires in my garage as evidence and I was remind of the HORRIBLE experience every time I saw the tires.

Having thoroughly researched the value of my trade in as well as the value of the vehicle I intended to buy, I was shocked to have John, the Internet Sales Manager offer me approximately $8,000 below the Kelly Blue Book trade-in value for my vehicle.  He then accused me of asking more for my trade-in than the car was worth.  What John neglected to tell me was that they were selling my exact model of car (except for more miles than my car) for $13,000 over their trade-in offer to me.  Greed and dishonesty, an unfortunate combination, in my opinion.  Please avoid this dealership if honesty and integrity matter to you.",1.0
1328,"February 21, 2013","My car drove under 70,000 miles and the owner`s manual says the 'power train warranty' covers engine control system.
My last visit for the diagnostic for 'check the engine light' concluded that it`s caused by malfunctioning of the engine control system.
Advisor says this malfunctioning was caused due to error code overflow in the engine control system.
( Even though the error code may be generated recently for the first time. )
Anyways they erased the error codes and now it seems my are is all OK.
As an electrical engineer as I`m I can conclude that it`s the reliability problem of engine control system with data managing.

I have to say that I was absolutely ripped off! I had no intention to buy a car and just wanted to test drive, but the salesperson got me! This person named Kamran was so eager to sell the car that he even lied about the car being &quot;Certified&quot;.  He made me so confused by going back and forth with different offer from the back room. After 3 hours wasting my time I was so exhausted that I wanted to get out of that place, so I signed everything just to get out of that place. They traded my car $5000 below the market and show me all kind of cunning evidence that my car is not worth that much.    At the time of purchase, I was not even given any paper as a proof of warranty. I feel so bad, so disappointed and angry of feeling such a stupid gullible!",1.8
1330,"November 13, 2012","I was in the market for a 2013 Lexus SUV. I went to Newport Lexus dealership and test drove a car there. I was reluctant to purchase it after the test drive. However, the sales person told me: what if I give you a price that you can't say no. (The sales person's name was Mark.) I agreed to sit with him for price negotiation. He literally wasted two and half hours of my valuable time to just give me a quote. His quote was just $2K below the MSRP. I got completely disappointed with his offer. I gave him my final offer and left the dealership after that. I explained to him that my offer is based on what other local people paid for the same car with the same feature.

Few days later during the weekend, the sales person (Mark) called me  and asked me if I am still interested to get a Lexus. I told him that I would only buy it if he can sell it $1K above what I already offered him the other day. He said he has a SUV Lexus in the inventory (in the lot) with less features that he would be able to sell it at that price. I told him that is not a problem. He asked me what time I can come to the dealership to seal the deal. I told him I would be there in an hour. So, I drove all the way from Los Angles to Newport Beach to Newport  Lexus dealership and I was asking for Mark. As soon as he saw me he said that he did not think I would show up! He said he does not have any car at my price. Can you believe it?!!! I got completely shocked that he changed his words and wasted my weekend time that I could spend with my family. I expected him to apologize for breaking his promise and making me drive from LA to Newport Beach, but he was so disrespectful and rude. I left the dealership and called the manager. He did not pick up his phone and I left a message on dealership's manager (Allen) voice mail and complained about the way his sales person (Mark) treat the customer. It has been two weeks so far and he has not returned my call yet. 

You would expect good customer service from a Lexus dealership, but that was far from our expectations.

Then he spent about one hour going over every feature of the vehicle, and of course I only remembered about 25% of what he told me so when I needed more information I called him and he was able to answer my questions quickly.

I would strongly recommend Nathan and this dealership.

My husband and I were treated like gold by the Internet Manager John Coon.  Not only did he have the car waiting for us when we arrived it was even set up in it's own special showroom. We were originally looking at purchasing at another dealership and John pulled up the cars we had interest in and spent over 45 minutes on the phone explaining the difference between the cars.  Not only did he do this without meeting us he took the time to explain the original cost of these items as we were looking at pre-owned cars and went through each maintenance schedules. We felt safe that we were dealing with a dealership with not only high integrity but also that they cared about their clients.  John was not only incredibly knowledgeable but we actually really enjoyed spending time with him.  Greg Lawson in finance was kind and informative as well.

The Tires were cupped when I bought it there was a dent in the side door and they gave me a CarFax that was 4 months old. They even had me come back to sign a new agreement 60 days after I had purchased the car which I didn't know at the time was a Illegal. When I almost died in the first accident after I had just purchased the car their own technician is the one that said that the tires were cupped and very noisy. I called and 2 of the managers Bobby and Allen were as rude as you can get. My father has been working on cars for 40 years and he looked over the car and right away could tell they had sold me a Lemon. I had to go to Corporate Lexus to get help and I'm positive that Newport Lexus will hear about it. I plan on articles in every major Newspaper in So Cal. I even have an invite to be on the News to discuss consumer fraud.

1342,"April 03, 2010","Do not buy here. 
This dealership is only interested in the sale. Go to Longo, Tustin, Riverside or any other Lexus dealer.  After the sale, their follow up was terrible; in fact, they did not follow up at all. When an issue surfaced they were non responsive and it was quite disappointing. And we are speaking of the management staff as well.

We had to call the dealership over 10 times in a 3 week period, each time getting transferred or leaving messages (that were not returned), trying to get a response-it never came.  After finding the salesman had retained a key for the new car purchased at Newport Lexus, the management team was unwilling to call him to try to obtain the key that belonged to us. We found that the salesman had separated from the company, but we did not view that as our issue, he worked for them and represented them, so we felt the dealership should try to rectify the situation. Instead of helping find a solution, Desk Manager Bobby S. insulted us by saying 'he found it hard to believe that we didn't receive the second key' and that 'they don't make it their practice to cut keys after the fact'. We ultimately had to go to corporate for a resolution. Corporate makes it their practice to listen to the customers that buy the cars. There was only one key delivered with this new car. Corporate understood and made it right but it's sad we had to spend so much time, effort and frustration trying to resolve a simple matter.    

Very poor judgment, customer service and absolutely the worst lack of follow through of any dealer thus far (we have bought over 16 cars at dealerships). Completely against the grain of Lexus' brand 'pursuit of perfection', this scenario was handled as if we were dealing with a used car lot on Harbor Blvd.

Do not buy here and put yourself in a situation where you may need follow through or customer service in the future; because these guys cannot deliver. Sadly, we found the poor customer service comes from the top (after speaking with the Sales Managers and ultimately the GM), so it’s likely that it will get worse before it gets better. 

What we found was this management team simply does not understand how to operate as a luxury brand should and they really do not understand how to retain customers (or have people raving about their location, facility or staff).  They really are not doing the Lexus nameplate any favors, but have in fact, tarnished the brand in Southern California.

arrangements to come down and pick up the new car, all of a sudden the lease rate was $1499.00 per month, plus tax and license.
