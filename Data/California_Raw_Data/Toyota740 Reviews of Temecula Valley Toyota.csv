0,"May 20, 2020","My sales person Nick made the deal safely over the internet. He gave me a fair amount on my trade in, delivered the car and drove the trade in back. He was thorough and presented an excellent price, and all of the incentives available.

I live in Palm Springs and neither of the local dealers want to make a sale. They would would only give me 15% of the KBB trade in value and would only sell their cars at sticker. I had even originally purchased the car from one of them, and they serviced it every 5,000 miles. They also had a very limited inventory.
This is my new favorite dealer!",5.0

16,"May 06, 2020","Having bought three cars from Temecula Valley Toyota 02/2019-05/2020, I must warn prospective customers about three matters, all of which concern attempts to inflate the price of cars.
     1. Sometimes, they fast-talk so that customers will consent to buy options without being adequately informed.
     2. Sometimes, they ask you to sign stacks of forms and a few of those forms involve buying add-ons that they never discussed with the customer.
     3. Worse, they always add items to the sales contract on the computer screen.  When showing the customer the computer screen, they scroll down so rapidly that the customer doesn't know what options he is purchasing.  Some of these items were never discussed.  Other add-ons the customer had refused repeatedly.  They do not put a paper contract in front of the customer and request it be signed; instead, they ask the customer to sign an almost blank, miniature screen about ten times.
     TV Toyota sells good cars, but exercise vigilance before signing anything!",2.0

29,"March 07, 2020","My wife and I have been getting our previous Toyotas"" serviced at Temecula Valley for over ten years. We are real happy with all the service, price of parts, timely appointments, plus they are usually done early so we can get on with our day.
We bought a new 2018 RAV4 here. Got a great deal, service is always pleasant, done fast.",5.0
30,"March 07, 2020","My wife and I stopped in to see what Temecula Valley Toyota had to offer and was met by their salesperson on the lot.  We clearly provided him with what we were interested in (a SUV) and discussed what our limited monthly budget range needed to stay within -- as we are both on Social Security. We then asked him to show us the cars available that would closely fit or needs and budget. He immediately took us straight over to a new 2020 Rav4 Hybrid and invited us to jump in.  We loved the vehicle. He said that it would fit within our budget and then the ""fun and games"" began. After waiting 2 hours and meeting several other random very friendly dealership ""VIP's"" in their sitting area we were told that the car was now NOT available, that someone else had bought it. Disappointed of course,  we were then led out to view other lower priced models of the Rav4 (which we had previously seen but did not care for at all). My wife and I decided to leave and as we were walking out the front door -- all of a sudden, we learned from the salesperson that he had some ""good news"" for us -- that the car we originally asked for was NOW available. We agreed on a price and did a deal ""handshake"". We waited another 2 hours to meet up with the Finance dept. -- and once inside, the monthly rate was far more than we had agreed to -- almost TWO TIMES more .  We, of course, had to refuse the car/deal and then we had to wait another hour for them to actually return our original car to us so that we could place our personal items back inside (they had earlier instructed us to give them our keys and to empty our car out.). As we were outside doing so, the salesperson came running after us with yet another ""higher-up"" Sales Manager by his side (we had spoken to about three other Key individuals along the way...) and we were again instructed to go back inside to meet the Finance person -- as apparently they thought the numbers came in far better that time. They didn't of course.  After sharing our complete frustrations and fussing about their ""sales process"" -- we had basically watched a whole Rams football game that Sunday afternoon we were still dumbfounded with the dealership's process. A terrible buying experience for sure. We eventually did come to an amenable  deal -- and the car was ours.  However, we have since come to the conclusion that my wife and I were both professionally misled and ultimately lied to. Therefore, I would NOT purchase another car from this dealer -- ever again.",1.8

65,"January 10, 2020","Sales quick to finance a deal with a warranty scam. DONT PURCHASE WARRANTY. Their warranty scam is expensive and the service department does a terrible job with service of the vehicle. 
They use a sheet and include check marks for the work completed. But as you drive away and see if they did in fact check all fluid levels, you will be disappointed. Every appointment I make I leave dissatisfied and mad at myself for agreeing to pay for the warranty and the result is poor quality.

107,"November 23, 2019","Wasn't able to get an appointment for an oil change prior to leaving town so I did something I hardly ever do, I went to a quick oil change place and regretted it the minute I drove in when they up charged me quite a bit for a an additional quart of oil.  I waited while they removed the oil and could not remove the old oil filter.  After claiming to be experts and having all of the right tools to remove filters the still could not remove the filter.  Needless to say they blamed the dealer for over torquing the filter when I last changed the oil.  I had them put the new oil in and and I called Temecula Toyota and spoke to Ruth.  She explained that when filters are replaced they are torqued to Toyota specs.  She told me to stop by and she would have the service manager check it out.  I showed up and met with the manager, (Nice gentleman but can't remember his name) and he told me not to worry that they would remove the filter, replace it with a new filter and top off the oil at no charge!

When my car was pulled out for delivery to me, I discovered the damage and notified the porter. In minutes my Service  Adviser Dave came out and  apologized and said that the initial vehicle inspection did not note any damage to the car. He set me up with a rental car at the dealers expense and sent my car to the body shop. Within 24 hours my car was returned to me in pristine condition.

I find this important as it demonstrated Temecula Toyota's commitment to do the right thing, to make an unfortunate situation as convenient and smooth considering the circumstances. When I returned the rental at the dealership, Dave the service adviser immediately came to me again apologizing for the minor damage and that if it is not up to my standard, please notify him immediately and he will make sure it is taken care of. I inspected the front bumper and it looked like new , the paint match was perfect and I will be a continuing customer of TV Toyota",5.0

380,"May 22, 2018",I wrote a lengthy Yelp review concerning my first purchase at Temecula Valley Toyota and buying from the staff and the salesclerk mgr Jim Pavone. So I wanted a rare and hard to find Toyota Tacoma TRD Pro. When I would find one and believe me I searched sometimes as far away as Colorado the Other Toyota dealers wanted what’s called a market adjustment. This is by no means a small amount it often ranged 3-10k over retail. But not the nice folks at Temecula valley Toyota. It was not marked up one cent. I couldn’t believe it. So I drove over a hundred miles and numerous Toyota dealerships on the way. No one was willing to do what they did and you know what? It didn’t stop there. The service is excellent that must be why TMV has stellar Yelp reviews which is unheard of for a lot of car dealerships so here I am thinking of purchasing my 3rd Toyota and I think you know who and where I’ll be going. It’s worth it to give them a shot at your business. I don’t get anything for writing this except the satisfaction of steering you clear of dealers that in my opinion aren’t anywhere near where these guys are in terms of fairness. You can buy from someone closer maybe but I doubt it’d be a better deal. I can’t recommend Jim or Temecula Valley Toyota any more highly. They might be in a valley but they’ll move mountains for you.,5.0

Previous complaint:  I have experienced terrible service from the Temecula Toyota Service Department!
I took my wife's Rav 4 in for a Transmission Converter recall on January 24th 2018, and they fixed the transmission ""shutter"", but now I can hear my engine over the sound of my radio.  The Service Department Assistant manager Adam, and the Service Department manager Josh, both let me know they heard the abnormal noise, and would find out what's causing the noise.  The service manager called me back four days later, and let me know that his Service Deparment Director let him know that he does not hear the noise.  Now the Service Department manager is stating that he must have been mistaken before, and he now hardly hears the noise either.  Sounds suspect to me.  My car has been at the Toyota Service Department for seven days, and they still do not know what's wrong with my wife's Rav!  I would not recommend getting any service done at the Temecula Toyota Service Department.",4.0

First, a warning sign, they used FOUR salesmen / manager types to try to get me to buy. All the while, until number four, no price. Number four said he would get me a good discount. I had told one and two, maybe three, cash purchase, no trade. They said it did not matter to them whether cash or finance, trade or not!!  I wish that were true!! .....  Midway through number four I was getting a bit stressed, which is the way these people operate, believe me. I wasn't the first or the last to be given this shoddy treatment.

I already had about six interested private party buyers, anybody would give me more than any dealer, so I said I will not be trading mine in (again)!!! They said then no discount.

530,"January 27, 2017","This dealership is top notch! I have had some unsatisfying experiences with Toyota dealerships in my area that I considered looking in the surrounding counties. After much consideration (other customer reviews, pricing, inventory, and overall rating), I chose Temecula Valley Toyota. 

Considering one of my biggest complaints about the other dealerships was the approach salesmen had and their inability to understand what I type of vehicle I was looking for in the past, this was a big factor. But this was not the case at this dealership. I was respectfully greeted and welcomed by Reggie. I explained what I truck and trim I was looking for and he immediately went to action. I reviewed their stock online and provided the VIN to him, which again to my surprise, the truck was in inventory. Even though I owned an older version of this truck previously, it was obvious Toyota made some major changes since. Reggie did a fantastic job going over the features and capabilities it provided. 

After deciding that I wanted to move forward with the purchase, I met another individual, Jim. I was inquiring about trading in my BMW and paying off the difference. I felt the process and price on the offer was completely fair and quick. Now both these guys provided exceptional customer service but more importantly they exhibited patience. I was THAT customer, a first time parent who decided to bring a baby that, during the process, was going off like fireworks in July as grandma watched her in the car. Unfortunately, the baby went through the bottles I brought and I was desperate to run to the nearest grocery store just to buy some ready made formula. Reggie drove me over to Target and I ran in, got the goods, and had a happy baby ten minutes later. 

And finally, one last part of the experience that really encouraged me to write this review. I have had interactions with Toyota car salesmen that are awkward or seemingly desperate to make a sale. Reggie and Jim were just plain cool. Easy to talk to, easy to interact with. This is probably the most important part for me as a customer. Not everyone can just do this job and they really out did themselves by building a solid relationship with the customer. Once, everything was completed, both these gentleman followed up next day to ensure everything was well. 

Overall, this dealership left a great impression and I would recommend anyone from the Orange County area to make the drive. ",5.0

737,"September 27, 2015","Perhaps it's the ownership change but this dealership seems to be very low on the satisfaction scale.  I had to ASK them to even fill the gas tank (prep'd for hand-over with half).  Also, they couldn't even give me an Owner's manuals case (the just gave me the off-the-shelf cardboard box), plus more issues... all this with the purchase of a high-end Toyota, a 2015 Avalon Hybrid with Nav.  They were nice to the point of the hand-off to the ""negotiator"" but after that it was down-hill.  Beware.",1.8
738,"May 06, 2015","I brought my older toyota in to have some safety recall issue addressed and a regular service while I was there. The customer service was really, really good. From the porter to the receptionist to my service advisor to the shuttle drivers; everyone was a pleasure to deal with. Prices at dealerships can be high in my opinion but my oil change was priced competitively and came with a car wash!! I can't remember the last time I drove away from a vehicle service with a smile but I was truly blown away by how hard Temecula Valley Toyota was willing to work for my business. I am switching from the local oil change shop to this dealership from now on. Thank you!",5.0
739,"August 22, 2014","I've been a loyal customer of this Dealership for over 10 years and have had both good and bad experiences, but bout a year ago I was directed to the Service Manager August Williams after one of the someone scratched my vehicle during the service of my Camry. He was extremely accommodating to my situation, they fixed the scratch on my car, and August offered to assist me during future visits. I picked up my Camry up today and it runs like the first day I drove it off the floor, Thank You Toyota! Everyone makes mistakes but its how you handle it that matters most, this Dealership knows how to take care of customers!",5.0
