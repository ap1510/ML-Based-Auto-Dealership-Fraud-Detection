0,"May 15, 2020",I recently brought in our X5 and X7 for routine service. On both occasions Anna Kwon was got me an appointment that fit my busy schedule and made sure that I had transportation to and from the dealership. She made a spot on recommendation to have my X5 detailed. I was very happy with how the care turned out. The faded steering wheel looked like new. They also got all of the dog hair out of the carpet! Joe Campo has been my service advisor for a long time and we have been through several BMW's. He is always honest with his recommendations and prompt and polite with his responses to my inquires. I will continue to take my BMW's to them for service.,5.0

4,"April 11, 2020","We bought our new BMW here for one, the facility is very attractive and clean, and two, everyone we dealt with was very friendly.  We have to give the highest praise for Nathan Reed, the salesman who helped us through the entire purchasing process.  No pressure, quite knowledgeable , and very friendly guy.  We initially started with the Volvo dealership to purchase a hybrid Volvo, but we turned away because of the facility, we had to look for a salesman, and the selection was not good.  It was a whole different and pleasing experience with BMW of Monterey.

Anna and Mike were all ready for me, had all my requests listed, got me in a loaner car and out the door in no time.  Same thing when I got back to pick it up.

16,"February 23, 2020","I dropped my car off at the dealership with Joe on Thursday at 1:15pm.  I did not get a call to let me know that my car was ready for pick up.  I called around 5:30pm to follow up and was told that the service department was closed for the day; however, the receptionist told me that I was able to pick up my car from the reception, which I did. When I got to the dealership, there were several sales people that were standing around, chit chatting and only when I asked where the reception was did they acknowledge that I had walked in. The receptionist was very nice and professional, but told me when handing my keys that my car was in the west parking lot and to walk around and click my keys until I found it. She offered to accompany me to find my car, but I declined. I did ultimately find it in the back parking lot behind a cement wall, but only after a 15 minute search through the entire parking lot. I was not pleased with this level of service.",1.0

20,"January 25, 2020","Maintenance on our 2014 X3 and purchasing our 2017 certified pre-owned i3, after leasing an i3 for two years, has all gone very well largely because the staff at Monterey BMW is efficient and customer-focused. ",5.0
21,"January 24, 2020","This was my first time in and Joe did a great job explaining my options for service  and the work performed was perfect and done in a timely manner.  I'm coming back next week for a thorough 90,000 mile service on my X3. ",4.8
22,"January 23, 2020","I took my 2015 BMW 535 Diesel in for my 50K check up and was greeted promptly the minute I walked in with a warm hello and smile.  Anna took care of the paperwork for my loaner and Joe processed all the information needed  for my service in a quick and efficient manner.  Joe gave me a quote and Anna handed me keys to a loaner and I was off.  Very efficient and quick and the professionalism that I witnessed is what makes me return there time after time.  Once my car was done, as I returned the next day at my request, I returned the loaner, which in itself was an impressive 2020 740i, and Joe handed me a bill which was significantly less than what he quoted me.  Needless to say with the loaner, the savings on the service and the quick and efficient service, I will definitely be going back and I would highly recommend them to anyone looking to get their BMW serviced.  Ask for Anna and Joe if you need help with your BMW.

Thanks

47,"December 10, 2019","I recently undertook a search for a new vehicle.  My last car purchase was from BMW of Monterey so I decided to check the dealership out again.  I was impressed with Ray's solution sales approach, his listening skills and his customer driven attention.  I purchased a low mileage 330i, 2019 loaner.  His follow-up was excellent and he was not pushy.  

 I worked with Joseph  on their Genius Team to orient me to the amazing features of the car and assist me with any technical issues.  I purchased the car before Thanksgiving and Ray called me just this week after a welcome email to confirm that all was working well.  I love the car and am very impressed with their interest in building a  working relationship with their team!  Thumbs up!

64,"November 06, 2019","I recently brought my car in for a tutorial on how to adjust a few things. The gentleman was prompt, polite, and explained everything  without talking down to me. I then opted to get an oil change and service. The service mgr. was also polite, friendly,  competent. My car was done in the estimated time, the final cost was within the estimate, and I  got a complimentary car wash and vacuum. It always costs more than one anticipates, but the mgr. gave me the best deal possible and worked with my budget. As always, Ray is the best.

I was with friends and visited five dealerships that day in order to get an overview of SUV's on the market.  We met Parris Yancey.  He was very personable and we all walked away thinking, ""What a great salesman.""  After narrowing my search down to two dealerships, I returned to BMW the following Thursday by myself.  As a single woman, it is intimidating to buy a car.  Parris really listened to what I wanted in a car and steered me to the perfect SUV for my needs.  He was very knowledgable and fun to work with as we test drove the car and went through the many features.

She told me drive in and ask for her and from that Point on everything was as smooth as glass.  My service provider Joe informed me my car was still under warranty and that all would be handled in a timely and efficient manner.  While I was speaking to Joe, Anna got me a loaner and handled everything quickly and efficiently.  What a pleasure it was to deal with these people.  If you have questions and are thinking about what BMW dealership to go to, hands down Monterey BMW.  Ask for Anna Kwon or Joe Campos.  They are professional, efficient and always positive .

I was met by Zack and he was a great first touch representative for the dealership. He made me very comfortable getting started.
Mike was great checking me in and setting expectations correctly.
Anna was magnificent in helping me in the next step of a loaner car. She sat in the car while I learned the nuances of the i3 and was so helpful.

In contrast my experience in the financing phase was not as pleasant. In the beginning, I was pushed hard to buy the lease insurance for $1995.

I submitted online enquiry for the BMW I was interested in, immediately in couple of hours I got response back from Ray. In another two days we finalized deal over email! All I had to do was to drive to Monterey from San Jose to pick up my new car! Once I was at their store no fuss around negotiated price, it was everything as we agreed in email (except for minor difference with my trade in). I was out in less than 2 hours from their store with my new BMW!! Ray was generous enough with his offer to deliver car to my home/office in bay area but I decided to pick up myself!

126,"May 05, 2019","Most impersonal dealership I’ve ever dealt in 50 years of auto service.  I regret buying a car from you and dread service.  My prior dealership treated me as a loyal friend.  I bought a new car from them and thereafter my service rep knew me by first name and was on top of details about my car.  My experience with your dealership is once you get the car sale closed there’s no need for trustworthy personal service.  Big disappointment.  I took my prior BMW to you for service for 5 years, experience was better then.  Big change after I bought a car from you.  Makes no sense.  After the purchase a part failed under warranty and I was accused of causing the failure and not being truthful in my presentation.  The service rep and I carefully examined the conditions around the failed part and found nothing unusual, just the failed part.  He said he’d have the shop look at it and advise.  30 minutes later I was told the problem was caused by a “collision” with scuff marks and a scratch around the failed part as proof of collision.  The service rep and I were dumbfounded when we saw the paint damage that appeared after the shop inspection.  He could not explain what had happened but offered to talk it over with the shop.  He returned to tell me a decision was made to replace the part.  I’m 100% certain someone in your dealership sabotaged my car to make it appear I had caused the problem.  Shameful.  It took me almost an hour to rub out the paint damaged in your shop. No one took responsibility for this and I assume the service rep facilitated a face saving solution.  Too inconvenient to drive to San Jose for service or I’d never return to your dealership.",2.6

I didn't really want to drive all the way home and come back another day for an appointment, when Anna recognized me from previous visits to the dealership and immediately came to my rescue. Anna said she would take care of it and she did. Bob Thomas, in the sales department also remembered me, and assisted as well, He knew immediately what was needed. They got the service technicians to check out the device and then replaced it. While I was waiting, Anna offered me water and a health bar to get me through the lunch hour wait. She was more than kind, totally efficient and gracious to be sure I was comfortable while I waited. What meant so much to me was that they both remembered me by name and were more than willing to interrupt what they were doing to assist me.

I experienced none of these things at this dealership. 
I believe it was because of a Parris Yancy my “salesman” who did not act like a salesman at all.
He was thoughtful, kind and knew what would be best for me. Things that I would not even have thought someone would care about. He knew I drove a lot for work so he got me an unlimited mileage warranty on the SUV chosen. 
So many things on this beautiful car that I did not expect that Parris got for me. 
Thank you Parris for making it all happen quickly and efficiently. 
Thank you Misty for your professionalism and thoughtfulness.

295,"September 30, 2017","Review of service department:  Undoubtedly the worst experience I've ever had in any service industry. Late, rude, broke my windshield and accused me of being a liar.  On arrival (10:35) I waited for 10 minutes for a service technician to check me in.  After going inside to find somebody to help I was told to wait at Mike's desk. He was with another customer and would be ""back soon"".  Another 10 minutes past and an alternative service rep asked what I needed. I explained that I was in for a air bag recall and had requested the shuttle into town whilst the work was performed.  He said the work would be 2-3 hours and shuttle pickup would be at 2pm (which I explained was important because I needed to be back home to pick up the kids from school). No proper check in, just a scribbled note ""to mike""  [this turned out to be a big mistake on my behalf..]

At 2:20, no shuttle, so I called to remind them of pickup. Back at the dealer at 2:50 (now running very late for school pickup) I asked them to expedite checkout and payment of my service inspection fee.  At 3:15 I had the keys to my car and was finally on my way, or so I thought...

I realized that the windscreen had been cracked (a big 12"" crack right above the steering wheel)!  I reported to issue to Mike, who was too busy to help, so another rep took and look and promptly called the manager. I explained that the windshield was not cracked when I brought the car in and it must have been done during replacement of the steering airbag or on test drive.  They told me I had obviously not noticed the crack when I brought the car in.  Not noticed!!! I had just driven 35 miles to the dealer with my girlfriend and it would have been impossible to have not noticed such a large crack RIGHT ABOVE THE STEERING WHEEL!  After some discussion, the manager of the service department point blank refused any responsibility and said that the intake paperwork showed the windscreen as existing damage.

It was at this point that I realized my check in mistake... in a rush to get on to the shuttle, the proper intake procedure was not followed. Why didn't I take a couple of photos of the car [something I routinely do when renting, etc]. Given the chaos that morning, I bet the car was worked on, test drove and then all the paperwork completed AFTER the window had been cracked. I didn't have time to argue anymore, it was 3:30, my girlfriend and I were already way late to fetch kids. I was disgusted and angry -- I was accused of lying about the state of the car. I felt like I was being treated like some punk kid that was trying to cheat the system [I'm over 50 and my integrity and fairness is fundamental to my life ethics].  My girlfriend was physically sick, worried about her son and speak-less about how a supposedly premium car company could treat repeat BMW buyers like this and accuse us of fabricating a story.

What am I going to do now?  Eat the $1000 cost of a windshield replacement, I guess.  And make sure that everybody is aware of the suspect practices and quality of Monterey BMW service department.

In summary, steer well clear of this service department -- Steven's Creek (San Jose) BMW is much better.  Always make sure you properly document the state of your vehicle prior to handing over the keys, treat time estimates with a pinch of salt, they are not concerned about your time.

298,"August 15, 2017","Recently ( 2+ weeks ago) bought a CPO  BMW  535i

The car was sold as CPO BMW, which meant that all required processes and parts must have been checked and if defected then should have been fixed/replaced.

But, upon driving it the first day, I realized:
* Door seal was torn.     It should have been in good condition  being a CPO car
* Missing air-conditioning vents . There  should have been in good condition  being a CPO car
* Left lift was missing.    It should have been in good condition  being a CPO car
* The brakes and rotors   created a vibration when one pressed the breaks
    No vibration should have been present, since the car was a CPO
* The dealership gave me just the first page of the CPO document.
Thankfully I brought the car for full inspection to another BMW dealership who detected all of the above problems.

  I FIND THIS (concealing the pages of the CPO document) a deceitful practice. It seems that the dealership wanted to hide information.

I complained the next day.  Mr.  Paul Giovino (General Manager), told me to bring it back the next week for the service department  to look at it. We made an appointment.

I brought it back. I was told that I will get an update in 20 min.  Already 50 min elapsed, no update.
 I have to go and demand from the service manager to go with me for a test drive to  be convinced that the car vibrates upon pressing the brake. Initially I was told that breaks and rotors are fine.
   ONLY after the test drive (on the highway), the service manager acknowledged that indeed there was an unacceptable vibration.

 The above behavior (not believing the customer, initially claiming there is no vibration, selling a CPO car that the brakes/rotors and vibrations should have been checked, AND only after my insistence for a highway test-drive to admit there are problems) is  UNACCEPTABLE!!!

I was asked to wait 4.5 hours. Of course I had to drive from San Luis Obispo (time, gas, cost) and spend most of the day in the dealership.

The fixed the seal on the door, put back the missing air-condition vents, and missing lift pad.
The surfaced the rotors, and the vibration subsided. I asked to replace the rotors, the dealership refused.

I requested couple of very  low cost items to be given as a gift/token appreciation  for my huge inconvenience,  BUT the dealership refused.

All of the above made me to believe that the dealership ONLY cares about the sale of the car. Absolutely they refused to negotiate.

In conclusion, I give:
* good reviews to the used sales person  Eldar K.   
      I believe it is NOT his fault.    Even though he should have known all the issues by checking the details in the CPO report.  Not Acceptable.  
* Poor review to the USED SALES MANAGER  (I do not recall his name)
 Bad attitude, NOT willing to negotiate
* Poor review to service manager.  Not believing that the car has issues. 
    NOT acknowledging that his service crew made big errors in producing a faulty and not accurate CPO report when the car was put on the lot to be sold as CPO Pre-owned.

I will NEVER recommend this dealership to anyone!!!!

Mike (in finance) suggested that I purchase the synthetic oil change and dent protection. Thank you, Mike. This purchase is worth its weight in gold! My 15 year old car, once again, looks brand new!

Vince, (the Technician), went over my car with a fine-tooth-comb, letting me know what I will need both now, and in the future, to drive my Roadster safely. 

Chris (my AWESOME ""Advisor""), presented me with an itemized list of needs. He spoke to me in a personal way, as if he were my friend, and not a service agent. I have never had this type of service anywhere else! Thank you, Chris.

Randy, the Service Manager, always comes out speaks to me, asking how ""Mon Bijou"" (my car) is doing. Randy is a superb service over-seer.....and knows everything that is happening in the service department.

424,"March 01, 2015","I really didn't think that dealerships, in the age of social media, operated as if it was 1985. I was naive. 

Back in January of 2014, I put a $5000 deposit down on a BMW i8. I was the first one at Monterey BMW to do so. 

Let me be clear that my situation is a complete ""first world situation"" to have. I'm not angry or disappointed. In fact, I'm slightly amused. The reason for my writing is so you can make a choice as to where you give your business too. 

And I also want to take my salesperson, Charles Joseph, out of the equation. He works for the management, he is not the management. I personally think he's a pretty decent guy, in a not so decently managed dealership. Of course, that's just my opinion. As is this review.

Back to the story. After many delays, my i8 was finally built and was going to be delivered around March 12th. I was not going to be here, so I went in before I left on my trip to pay for the car. 

They had put a $75,000 mark-up on the car. Think about that. That's more than 50% of the MSRP of the car. 

Charles and I never discussed a price for the car. I had assumed that since the car was in demand, I would pay MSRP for the car. Of course, after Charles showed me the paperwork, another sales manager came out and insisted that Charles had told me that the car was going to be marked-up by $50k to $100K over sticker. Ah, no he had not, because if he had, I would have asked for my deposit back a long, long time ago. 

The manager took me into his office (Tom Myers old office) and after some small talk, offered to sell me the car for only $25,000 over sticker. He was gracious enough to keep this offer open until tomorrow, in case I changed my mind. 

I won't be changing my mind. Nor will I buy another car from them or refer anyone to them again. I'm a pretty fervent ""car-guy"" and people ask me what and where to buy. Monterey BMW is off my list.

As I said, a ""first-world problem"" to have. But if they think that they can so easily gouge someone buying a $140,000 car, think of all the ways they have to take advantage of many people, buying $40,000 cars. 

Buyer beware, be careful and spend your dollars at ethical places of business.

447,"June 27, 2014","Over the years I have bought a number of new cars in the area and it has always been a rather unpleasant experience bordering on the feeling I was dealing with a Nigerian prince who needed somebody to look after a sum of money!

Full disclosure, I am extremely skeptical of car sales people and one sniff of slimy or not completely honest and I am gone!

This was completely different. They had a car in inventory that I liked the look of. I got an internet price from Gary with no fuss. I had done a lot of research before going into buying a new car this time and knew from Kelly's Blue Book and others what I might expect in terms of cost. Other dealers had sworn blind about what a good deal they were offering while I knew that was in fact not the case.

However, the price I got first time up from Gary was actually slightly better than expected so I knew I at least had a good yardstick to test that price with other dealers. Nobody else was offering as good a deal so I made the 60 mile drive to the dealership for a closer look.

At that point we met Phil who took me for a test drive and explained the plethora of toys on the car. When I told him my wife and I wanted to chat it over. He got us coffee gave us a place to go and left us alone until we were ready to talk. We spent some time chatting to him and to Gary and both of them were friendly, seemed very straight talking and easy to work with without any of the many shabby sales ploys that tend to leave you feeling a bit violated.

After a bit of discussion, we wrapped up the deal pretty easily. I had told Gary that I was looking to avoid a previous experience with the post sales person trying to scare you into many unnecessary add on's and he assured me they would not do it.

I was asked one question on that by the Finance Manager (who was terrific), I said no I don't want any of it and it was done!

Since the purchase I have had phone calls to check everything was good as well as offers to help out with any issues. 

The experience was even better because I was bracing myself for it being a pain but that does not take away from what a good job these guys did and have promised to do in the coming months and years.

I would unreservedly recommend the dealership on the strength of how it went with the people I met. In fact I already did. When you get a new car, people talk to you about it especially if they too are in the market for something similar.

Michael Godick greeted me and when I told him what I was interested in, he showed me the range of cars - from the 640i all the way to the M6 and the Alpina.  The models the dealership stocked were well equipped and allowed me to see what was possible.  Michael made it easy for me to drive both the 650 and the M6.  He priced them out for me and showed me a possible trade value for my car.  Finally, I said I might rather go with the 640i.  No problem, Michael let me drive one of those.  As we drove, Michael explained all the features on the car, and there are plenty of them. All the cars were great, so I wanted time to think and said I would come back.  The next day Michael called to say that he was able to get me a better price on my trade in.  I told him I wanted to see one of the 6 series he had mentioned to see how easy entry and exit was.  No problem.  When I got to the showroom, Michael not only had the car I wanted to look at ready for me, but also suggested I look at an M5 since it might give easier entry and exit (he had picked up on my needs and had a solution).  We drove both cars, and I decided on the 650i.  I wanted to make sure my wife liked to color, so Michael suggested I take it home over night.  The next day we did the deal, and I am very happy with the car.  I was back a couple of days later with a few questions.  Michael is very knowledgeable and explains things very clearly.

461,"December 26, 2013","In search for a BMW 328d xDrive Sports Wagon I contacted 5 dealers in the greater San Francisco bay area.  The dealership in Fremont did not even bother to pursue my business.  Gary Kihs at BMW of Monterey on the other hand was extremely proactive to win me as a customer.  He made sure I understood all the options and features, provided supporting documentation and most of all worked hard to quote me a price that was unmatched by the remaining 2 BMW dealerships.  [BMW of San Jose had the attitude take it or leave it at MSRP while BMW of Mountain View was more active and initially had the best 1st offer.]
As the 328 Diesel seems to be a car BMW intends to be sold in the US only to lower fleet consumption none of the dealers had a car on order or available for test drives.  Luckily I had had a chance to rent the wagon in Europe so the test drive was not an issue.  However, a purchase from a local dealership meant that the car needed to be custom ordered, a process that can take quite some time as the car needs to be manufactured in Germany and shipped to the west coast.  Gary worked some magic securing a production slot within a couple of days of my order.  Ultimately the car arrived 10 days sooner than anticipated based on typical BMW lead times.
When picking up the car Gary was flexible as to my schedule and the process was very streamlined and pleasant.
Throughout the entire interaction, Gary did not try to sell me something I did not need nor want, he suggested a few options, but when I declined he did not press me.

Bob just sold a car to my neighbor, and that was a legendary achievement because she has been on the ""verge"" of making that decision for over 10 years, but just could not culminate that intention -- not until Bob entered the scenario.  He perceptively gave her even more time to think about the purchase -- never even intimating that time was of essence.  He spent an inordinate amount of sincere hours answering questions, providing information, and even drove a car to her home so that she could be in a comfortable environment while test-driving.  Bob accomplished the impossible by having a genuine, personable, and ultra patient demeanor.  He is a genius!
PAUL DADSETAN:  As the general sales manager, Paul worked in tandem with Bob, and made very reasonable financial decisions which definitely facilitated the sale.  The cohesiveness and orchestration between management and sales is noteworthy!  Excellent!
CHRIS ALMEIDA:  He is like the ""Ambassador,"" because of his knowledgeable ""over the top"" way of resolving issues expertly and expeditiously.
Chris represents the service department at the highest level by his responsiveness, follow-through, and keen intuition.  Whenever I have a mechanical problem, I know Chris will solve it, and do so most pleasantly.
MIKE HAYWORTH:  I have known Mike forever, and he is renowned for his longevity of excellence.  He makes discretionary managerial decisions which beautifully balance between the store and the customer.  For example, he exchanged a logo shirt when, technically, he did not have to; however, I will never forget that customer good faith gesture!

We were on the famous route 1 scenic drive when the Check Engine light came on. For those who know this route, there is limited shoulder to pull over on and the fear of breaking down was haunting me. I had to make it 50 more miles to Monterey so I can drop off my family at the Aquarium and fine a BMW service center. Once I made it to Monterey I did a quick search for a service center. Come to find out, I found the friendliest, most professional BMW Dealerships around (I knew I was not in L.A. any longer). I called in for an appointment. Fully booked! All I wanted was to bring my Ultimate Driving Machine in for a quick diagnostic check to see if I can safely drive back to L.A. Not expecting any service to be done, due to the dealership being fully booked. Lucky for me, I walked in and meet Christopher Almeida. What a wonderful service advisor!!! I would love to hire a person like him. Christopher not only took care of my car, but had it fixed and error free for my worrie free trip back home.

488,"May 24, 2013","Kenny Lampton is the best Service Advisor. He listened carefully to what my issues were, and how a different advisor did not follow through. He went the extra mile to help me resolve the issues, and worked to resolve the issue on my car on the spot rather than make me come back. He also was very patient with my lack of ability to describe auto jargon, and understood what I needed. He is a great asset.  You could tell he cares about the company and the customer. He also provided up to date status while I was waiting. Excellent experience. He worked very hard to help me and I could tell a couple employees he had to deal with we're not that helpful. He had the most amazing patience and kind nature. He made me feel very comfortable and I felt I could trust him. 

Bob Thomas is an amazing car consultant/salesman. I've been buying and leasing cars for 25 years and Bob has been the best experience Ive ever had. I was very unsure about what I wanted. He was so patient with me and provided information on all my options with no pressure. I felt he cares and enjoys his work. Also after I got my car I came back a couple times with questions about how my car works and he took time with me to teach me about some of the options in the car. I will for sure go back to him for my next car. I trust him and he is very kind and professional. Not only is he an asset to BMW, he is an asset to the car industry. I wish everyone was like him. I think people would buy more cars. 

These days it is so rare to experience amazing customer service. I love the BMW, but even if I didn't I would just continue to lease or purchase BMWs just because of Bob an people like Kenny. ",4.6

I fully expected him to apologize for providing the false information and move on, but instead he and his Manager provided me with more and more statements that proved to be untrue in an attempt to justify the false claim.

Making false misleading claims to close a deal is unprofessional, and should not be tolerated by a high line dealership 

I write this compliant to make others think twice before believing what Gary Kihs and his GM Paul Giovino are saying.  Credibility Zero!

As I was looking at the X5 models on the lot, I was aproached by Bob Thomas. He asked what I was looking for in the X5 and completely educated me on the four different models of the X5. Bob is a WONDERFUL sales associate! I never once felt pressured to purchase to a vehicle from him. I was looking for an X5 in black but there was not one available on the lot, so he went out of his way to find one at another dealership. He found 15 at other dealerships. We decided to go back out on the lot to see exactly what was out there, and that's when I found MY X5. It was a dark blue and I completely fell in love with it. Had Bob not taken me back outside Ito look at the inventory I would have never found MY car. My overall experience with Bob sold me on the BMW and never gave the Range Rover Sport another thought.

Gary is not punctual and efficient person; I had to wait in the lobby for 35 minutes, although, we agreed to meet at a specific time to test drive a few BMW models. I felt disrespected and not valued customer at all. I was given a different impression about prioritizing his business items and about his customer service. I was very disappointment. The second reason, he asked subtle questions to gain better feeling of whether you have the money to buy lux car. I felt he was sizing me up; he also look at the way you dress from bottom to top - scanning. His energy and his questions are irrelevant for buying cars. Associating place and dress with selling cars is poor assessment tool; Furthermore, When I requested a quote about 135i, his answerer was vague and he said that my Q is very contradicting and then asked for clarification then he changed the subject and start to wrap up. 1st impression is always very important.

586,"October 27, 2011","Absolutely the BEST car purchase experience I've had in my life.  I've purchased three new cars in the past four months alone and I dreaded every one of them.  I generally don't think much of folks in the car sales business.  It's unlikely that will change, but my experience with BMW of Monterey wasn't anything like my previous purchases.  There was no pressure.  I did my research ahead of time and when I thought I was ready, I entered tke dealership ready for a hard negotiation over price.  I believe in being fair with the dealer as I know that they are a business, but I expect them to be fair with me as well.  This is the first dealership that didn't play a lot of games with me.  I told them what I thought was fair and how I arrived at my price and before I could finish, the Sales Manager (Joe Adams) told me that he only wanted my business and he quickly beat all previous offers that I had from other BMW dealers in the area.  He also beat the price I was prepared to pay based on my research.  My initial Sales Associate (Steven Wright) was extremely knowledgeable, helpful and patient.  I had to special order my car and he retired before it arrived, but he did a nice hand-off to my new Sales Associate (Jeff Morgan) who was absolutely great.  Again, no pressure, great communication, and very thorough and helpful during the delivery.  Each of these gentlemen are very personable and professional and I would highly recommend them and this dealership to anyone who is looking for the products they sell.  While mine was a business transaction and I'd never spoken to Joe, Jeff or Steven before, they really made my wife and I feel like we were long-time friends.  The product is good, but I ended up buying it based on my experience with these three and I have already tried to steer my friends who are car shopping toward them.  I've NEVER posted an on-line review before, but they earned it!",4.8

What really got me was the personal attention he extended along with the patience he exhibited in working with us through the process. We live in the bay area and we purchased our vehicle in Monterey despite the fact that there are probably 5-6 bmw dealerships around our house. That goes to say how much we enjoyed our buying experience at the BMW of Monterey.

This review would be incomplete without a mention of all the supporting staff that worked around George to make this happen... Gary Kihs worked tirelessly with us through the negotiations to make it work for both us and the dealership (yes, it has to work for both parties for the deal to go through... :). Michael ""Misha"" Godick has been great with handling our ""post sales"" experience.

Needless to say, BMW of Monterey is on the top of the list as far as my choice of a BMW dealership is concerned.

589,"October 18, 2011","Been going to them for years because I keep my cars along time. Mike the parts manager is excellent, when there is a deal on something he'll let you know if you want him to.  I have a 335i and when Dinan offered a special sale, which is rare, he let me know about it and I saved thousands doing an upgrade I wanted. My mechanic, same person works on my car every time there, did the install... I didn't want any unknowns when you're boosting the power of a twin turbo by 25%. If you don't want to be bugged, no worries. Mike and his team have a lot of experience and know the product, what BMW offers, what tires the community is moving to for performance or ride if you want and what after market equipment is available as well as if it impacts your warranty. You just can't get that service from an independent or general auto parts store. Makes it so much easier to go to someone who knows what they are talking about when buying parts and they communicate with the shop folks better than any dealer I've worked with. The prices are very competitive with all the chain stores on parts and labor, so it's great to know you have one guy working on your car, one set of maintenance records and a team of folks you can talk to. I only go in for regular maintenance on my newer car but on my older BMW they take care of the wear and tear items too. So it's nice when you can be comfortable with the fellow on the shop floor ask questions, the parts guys know you and your car, the service rep is on a first name basis. I was worried when the dealership changed hands, new management historically does a bad job when it comes to long term customers but so far the parts and service guys have been steady and doing the same great job for me.

616,"June 13, 2011","I started my X5 shopping via e-mail (from home in Fresno, California) and BMW of Monterey's Terrie Ross stood out among other dealerships who replied.  She was quick to get back to me, got right to the nut of the deal, placed my special order and kept me regularly updated on my X5's progress through delivery.  My final purchase experience was equally well-organized.  James Jones in Finance clearly explained the available options, had the paperwork ready for our arrival and we were in and out in no time.",5.0
617,"June 08, 2011","our 3rd BMW from Cliff was just like the last 3; excellent.  we feel comfortable with cliff as far as his knowledge of the cars as well as the fact that he's working with us to get us into the car we want within our budget.  He's also not one of those ""slimy"" car salesmen we're dealt with at other dealerships.  the test drive also is a very good demo of the car's features and capabilities.  we also were able to reach a deal within a very reasonable timeframe and knew we were getting a good deal.  overall, i'm sorry to hear cliff is retiring, but have appreciated all his work with us on all 4 our of BMWs",5.0
618,"June 04, 2011","My overall sales experience was excellent.  

I bought my last BMW from this dealership.

The service department can be hit and miss at times.  Sometimes there is a long
wait while waiting for a service representative to help you.  That is my only issue
with this dealership.

619,"June 01, 2011","From the first point of contact to the moment I drove my certified 2008 335i convertible off the lot, Gabe was informative, responsive and easy to work with in the sale.  He is knowledgeable about BMWs and cars in general, and was willing to spend the time with me to familiarize me with the features of my BMW.  At my request, he arranged for a wheel swap (I wanted 18s instead of 19s)with another used BMW, and was always friendly and helpful.  I highly recommend this dealership, and Gabe is a great guy to work with if you are shopping for a BMW.

620,"June 01, 2011","The survey from BMW corporate could not be picked up because of some computer glitch.
Misha was once again wonderful and honest to deal with and explained everything thoroughly.  I got a little confused from Steven about the optional coverage for tire blowout/windshield cracking for about $1,800 extra.  It sounded as if a nail got into the tire, a light went on the dashboard, and I had 150 miles to get to a garage.  But then I was told it would require a complete tire replacement.  When I called Sullivan's Tires later that day, and told them it was a Continental tire and explained the situation, the serviceman mentioned unless the nail went into the side of the tire, they could repair any Continental tire for a nail insertion--and so I was wondering why the dealership mentioned each time a nail went in, you would have to buy another $250 tire????  Can BMW corporate try to send me another survey to my email???  thanks, George Fusco",4.8
621,"May 05, 2011","I have never had a better experience at a car dealership! My sales rep, Walter Irish, is truely a BMW enthusiast and gave me straightforward, honest information that enabled me to get the best BMW for my money. When I first stopped in at the dealership it was only to waste some time before an appointment. 2 test drives later and I was hooked. A few visits later and I had a brand new 335XI on order. 1500 miles later and I couldn't be happier. I have always drive old, used cars. I have now learned that you get what you pay for (plus free maintenance).

They also have great coffee:)",5.0
622,"May 03, 2011","Thank you to Gabe and Gary for working with me until we found the perfect car for my needs!  I really think of you two as my new BFFs!  I LOVE driving my BMW and really appreciate the time you took in helping me realize my BMW dream!!  You guys are the best!

Everytime I walked into the dealership I felt like I was coming home again.  People recognized me and were more than willing to help answer questions.

625,"April 16, 2011","My wife and I were very pleased with the manner in which the purchase of our new 2011 BMW 328i Sedan was handled by Client Advisor Steven Wright: from initial meeting, price negotiation, and final purchase.  We were impressed with the no pressure and very patient approach he demonstrated by explaining every detail and special features of our new BMW, and his finesse in handling the complete transaction, even contacting our automobile insurance company representative to update our insurance policy before we drove off with our new BMW! Purchasing a new automobile can be a pleasurable and stress-free experience when dealing with a sales person of Steven Wright's caliber!",5.0

He worked the best possible deal for the car and my trade in. It was a win win for both me and the dealership. I would recommend BMW of Monterey to everyone. ",4.8
627,"April 11, 2011","Everyone was exceedingly helpful and professional.  I came to the dealership focused on a particular car and had a price in mind for the same. There was absolutely no sales pressure and when I got presented with the initial offer it was better than I expected and in line with what I wanted to pay, or even better.  Bob Thomas was great and knowledgeable and refreshingly, instead of making up an answer, he would say ""I don't know"" when he didn't know, but then researched the answer and got it for me. True class. Scott Koster was also very helpful and I made the initial contact through him. My family will certainly return when it's time to purchase our next vehicle.",5.0
628,"April 09, 2011","We had a great experience.  Bob was so helpful without pressuring us in any way.  We drove several cars since we weren't sure which model we wanted, and Bob was patient throughout.  Once we made our decision, he handled the deal quickly and efficiently.  The financialmperson was also exceptionally nice and efficient.  ",5.0

630,"April 08, 2011","My experience was great from beginning to end. Client advisor Gary Kihs took the time to contact me about a car for sale, and it is the perfect car for me. He was knowledgeable, professional, and helpful as we executed the sale in a timely manner. He followed up the sale a week or two later with a call to see how I liked the car.

The car was well prepaired and ready when promised, financing was done very quickly with a very good rate.  Service was very friendly and returned my call with the information that I had requested.

632,"April 03, 2011","My 2008 7 Series had a very bad navigation system and cell phone design.  Also, the service at the two BMW dealership in the Silicon Valley was far below average (owned by big coporations trying to reduce cost).  I had decided to buy a Mercedes from a dealer in Monterey and I stopped by BMW of Monterey on the way because of ratings at ""DealRater.com"".  Mike (Michal) was great!  The new 7 Series had dramatically improved navigation and cell phone capability - any Mike could actually demo them properly.  Their service has several features that make it look much better (even though they are also owned by a different big company).  The car exceeds my expectation and they have followed up with several contacts to make sure things are o.k.  Very positive experience.  And, the paperwork only took 20 minutes - beat that!",5.0
633,"March 20, 2011",The dealership was very honest on pricing vehicle. Walter had suggested web sites for pricing vehicle which I took home to investigate before my purchase. I counter the price given the next day  and it was accepted with a little counter offer (floor mats). It made me feel I made a great deal.,5.0
634,"March 18, 2011","Great deal; the car was as advertized
Low pressure; no sales pressure this is what we wanted and what we got
Low stress; no games fair price
Delivered as agreed; there were a few items that we wanted that were not in stock, they arrived as planned yesterday in perfect condition

Overall: Smooth transaction, Cliff was very easy to work with, we are 100% happy, and the biggest compliment is that we will return when we are ready for another BMW....

Also, the financial staff was helpful and swift in assisting with the signature of all the paperwork.
The phone manners of the receptionist are excellent and worthy of a high-end dealership.",5.0

Thanks to Bobs easy going demeanor along with his thorough product knowledge made my BMWx3 buying a fun experience. I enjoyed the one on one low pressure selling method he conducts. I am looking forward to my X3 as it goes
into the build cycle, it's more than just a car, it's a precision machine waiting to be motored. Thanks for allowing me to express my honest appreciation.

637,"March 04, 2011","The dealership is elegant and clean. The staff is polite, polished and friendly. The negotiations for our car purchase went very smoothly and were fair for both seller and buyer. The sales representative went out of his way to be helpful, explain the car, arrange for final detailing of the car and to deal with a few small spots that were missed in the detailing process. We feel extremely well treated, treated as if we were special and would unreservedly recommend this dealership to friends and family.",5.0

641,"February 11, 2011","My wife shopped around the entire central coast for a used BMW. She shopped for several weeks. She came across your dealership in Monterey online while searching for just the right car. She got a hold of Gabe and discussed the possibility of working a deal involving a trade in. Gabe was very helpful in making the numbers work for both parties. He also was very helpful in finding the right financing, taking our loan from 6 yrs to 5 and lowering our payment by a hundred dollars a month. Needless to say that made me happy. While at the dealership we were greeted by many of the employees and made to feel at home. We would like to thank for such a pleasant experience and look forward to doing business with you in the future.",4.8

Everyone from Eddie to finance to delivery were professional. I've bought a lot of cars in my life and this was the best delivery of a car I have ever had.

645,"January 20, 2011",Cliff Gaston is a tremendous individual and a great sales representative for BMW of Monterey.  He is the best!  I have purchased BMWs in Monterey (only BMWs for my personal use) since 1977.  I have always been pleased with the sales and service staff at BMW of Monterey.,5.0
646,"January 19, 2011","The entire process was easy, professional and smooth. The vehicle I wanted was not in stock and the team hunted the country to find the vehicle I wanted and then were able to trade for it without increasing the price we had agreed upon. The vehicle is amazing to drive and the entire team at BMW of Monterey was and continues to be outstanding.

I did all the legwork by phone and e-mail and when I went to the dealership, everything was planned and ready. I never waited for more than 2 minutes and was in and out in record time with no surprises. If you live out of the area, it is well worth the drive to be treated so well!",5.0
647,"January 18, 2011","BMW produces one of the finest automobiles in the world, if not the finest. As with all automobiles ,as time goes on, attention is needed to keep the vehicle in top running shape. The service and attention one receives is the mark of one of the finest dealerships in Northern California, Bmw of Monterey. Julian has been the go to guy for me for a number of BMW's that I have owned. Not only does the job get done right the first time, Julian always takes time to explain what was done, and the car is ready on time. Please give BMW of Monterey serious consideration when purchasing and service for your BMW.",5.0

649,"January 13, 2011","   It was a cold, late, rainy, New Year's evening of this year, when my red dash light came on and I saw that the car was overheating. This was on Hwy 1 outside of Monterey, CA and pulled off the road to the closest gas station. I put some water in and let it cool down but still the light stayed on. I was forty miles from my house with no way to get home so I made my way to the BMW dealership just a few blocks away.

When I pulled up to the dealership their lights were still on and a few sale reps were at their desk. I walk up to the first rep I came to and explained my problem and asked if there was a car rental near by. He told me that since it was a holiday and late only a few were open and none near here. With that said, my new friend Walter Irish said he would be off work in less then an hour and would be happy to drop me off at my house. It turns out he lives in my direction but it was at least thirty minutes out of his way to get me to my home.

Walter helped me dropped off my car at service, and then I waited for Walter to finish with a customer. As we were getting set to leave the sales manger Scott Koster came over and introduced himself; very nice guy.  Since Walter had a smaller car Scott asked him if he cared to take one of the new loaners for the evening to make me more comfortable.

Off we went into the rain and cold in a very nice BMW. Walter and I had a great conversation all the way to the house and none of it about how he was going to get me into my next car. It was one of the nicest experiences I have ever had from any dealer anywhere. I was more than service; it was person being just a person with a genuine concern for someone in need of assistance.

Dealerships talk about customer service coming first; at this dealership it’s a reality. Thank you Walter and Scott for being there for me. I will be seeing you for my next car when the time comes.

650,"January 13, 2011",Was greeted on arrival by numerous service staff with genuine warm welcome. Was offered coffee.  No wait required to get immediate service. Reservation ddtails and service needed were already recorded and minimum time was required to get service request prepared.  Friendly disucssion with service advisor while doing this. Current service advisor remembered me from last visit as on all previous visits with former service advisor. Discount coupons were honored immediately and reflected in final bill. Separate staff set up paperwork for loan vehicle which was ready and immaculate. Was called by service advisor as soon as car was ready. He had to use own cell phone since local phone service was down. Car SPA service resulted in immaculate care with great attention to detail.,5.0

These guys scoured the inventory EVERYWHERE.  I had other dealers looking too.  The other dealers were offering me compromises.  BMW of Monterey got us exactly what we wanted.  The old saying, ""Beggers can't be choosers"" is not true.  At BMW of Monterey, Beggers CAN be choosers.  Thanks guys.  You got us the SUV we would have ordered had we had the time.",5.0

He helped set up the computer and explained the Navigation details and then transferred my cell-phone address book to the BMW on board system.  the reason I traded my Infinity was because of dissatisfaction with the local deler-(Cardinale).  BMW of Monterey has a strong reputation for outstanding custermer satidfaction so I visited there.  the sales team was helpful and straightforward in their sales presentation.

660,"December 10, 2010","BMW of Monterey is an exceptional car dealership. The sales department is informative and supportive, at no time did I feel hurried or misguided. Since the purchase of my 335i coupe back in January, the service department has been accessible, comforting, fair and professional. After 10 months my car was making noises, I took it in and within a couple hours I was politely informed that a defective muffler had been sold with my car, a new one had already been ordered from the manufacturer and would be in within one week, and that the service department would replace it at my convenience- all at NO cost to me.

He reccomended the X3 (we need small- moving to Korea).  Monday morning we dropped off the M3 for apprassal, Monday night we test drove an X3 and made the trade.
Walter Irish- stayed over 2 hours past closing time to do all the paperwork. We drove home with our new ""used"" X3. BMW Monterey has since detailed it and ordered us new floor mats.  Walter has worked above and beyond to expediate things for us as we prep the car to send it overseas.  
We are so VERY pleased with the service. I was sad and hard for my husband to give up his M3 but we know we will not be dissapointed with another BMW.

From the first impression of walking into the show room, to the discussion of purchasing a vehicle, this dealership is a cut above the rest. I have been to the larger BMW dealership in Santa Clara Valley, where it is a challenge to get the attention of a sales person. When I first met Bob Thomas I knew this was going to be a different experience. He answered all my questions, including the important cost of the vehicle, and he let me decide what was best for me. Ahh, but how about the all important follow up after the purchase? Bob was, and is always available to answer any questions about the features which can be quite complicated.

The kicker for me was when I just looked on-line (a couple of months after leaving them)and found those same cars (same VIN #) at other dealerships... so they wouldn't sell them to a customer at a fair retail price, but they would sell them at auction... brilliant.",2.0

679,"June 09, 2006","For me it would have been a 75 miles trip as well, but with the stellar rating below and the abysmal record of BMW dealerships in the bay area, I thought I'd give them a shot.

Salesperson was quick to respond to my email inquiry regarding when they'll have their first E92 coupes in the showroom, but when I followed up with asking about the time-frame for European Delivery, he didn't bother responding anymore. This must have been his way of telling me that the dedicated European Delivery section on their web site is just for decoration purposes. To be fair, he did volunteer an invaluable piece of information before ending the conversation: they don't have any mark-ups on their cars. Hear, hear! I guess this is what they mean by ""low prices every day"".

What should have made me suspicious from the start is that they advertise the outgoing E46 model with the respective old prices and data alongside a picture of the upcoming E92 coupe. That's rather misleading, to say the least.

Quote from their web site's intro page: ""Our values - integrity, respect..."". To that I can only say: actions speak louder than words.
