0,29-Apr-20,"Kevin Lam, my salesperson at McKenna and his Manager Steve Majick worked together to help me find and order my new BMW. I take my current BMW there for service and always had an excellent experience so when it became time to get a new one, I reached out. I went with Kevin because after visiting several other dealerships, I found him to be extremely knowledgeable about the vehicle I was interested in, he listened to me, he indulged my need for detailed information and he worked with me on a way to get exactly what I wanted at a price that no other dealer came close to. I am very impressed with Kevin and Steve. I greatly appreciate their demeanor, attention to what I wanted, and their responsiveness to my endless questions. I will update this review after my vehicle arrives (hopefully in a few weeks now that the plant is reopening next week) and I take delivery. Thank you guys! I think you are great! Shout out to Lina in service too! She has always been wonderful when I was in for service!",5
1,26-Dec-19,"Kevin Lam salesman has screwed up our BMW experience as we‚Äôve been BMW loyalists for a decade. What a way to represent BMW! Shame on him! Kevin Lam is the worst, rudest, unprofessional staff we've ever encountered in BMW history, period. He himself doesn't even know the price and the worth of the cars yet is there sitting there trying to JUDGE our knowledge. We've done research before coming in so we know what we want and what we're looking for. And please, don't be picking up calls in front of us and taking ur sweet time to talk to them on the phone, then proceeding to use the computer in front of us, as if we don't exist. xxx???? this dude is a JOKE! At least have the decency to step away and do what u gotta do away from our sight. We left right away and the next day got the car at another dealership. Glad we took our money and time elsewhere. Ain't got time to waste it with useless rude people.",1
2,30-Sep-19,"I wanted to write a complaint to BMW North America and wherever I can write complaint to correct how Mckenna treat customers, but I decided to start from here.

I made an appt for Friday(9/27) for my fog light malfunction notice. One of the representative checked the vehicle and let us know the detail of our warranty. Maintenance warranty expired at 36k mileage, but the fog light might be under the regular warranty 50k mileage as long as it wasn't due to any damage. I completely understand how the warranty works so I let him know it's fine.
He let me know that I can pick up the car the next day (Saturday) and offered to provide UBER ride.
I unfortunately needed to get the car back on Friday, so decided to reschedule for Saturday morning.

Something came up and I couldn't go on Saturday, but rescheduled for Monday(9/30).
When I got there, Claudia helped me and she checked the vehicle and let me know the same warranty detail other representative told me, so I let her know that I understand the coverage.

The main difference was that she went to check with the Service Manager Armando and told me due to some damage under the fog light, in order to run the diagnostic I would have to pay $95, and if the malfunction was not due to damage, I wouldn't have to pay. When I let Claudia know that previous representative didn't need me to pay that $95 to run diagnostic and the only reason I didn't leave the car was due to needing the vehicle on the same day. She then tells me that he might haven't seen the damage, and that diagnostics are usually $180 but I'm only doing it for $95 in case it was due to damage.

I was so upset with their service and asked for the manager's business card, and he didn't even come out to explain or give the card himself. There are closer BMW around where I live, but I went to Mckenna, because that's where I purchased my vehicle, but this service made me realize they are not consistent with their service, and seems like they try to charge customers every penny they can.

The scratch below the fog light is noticeable, but the first representative was willing to do the checkup and let me know if it's covered under the warranty, but Claudia / Armando wanted to charge $95 for just doing the checkup before even finding out if it was covered under the warranty or not.

Funny thing is I just came to BMW in Buena Park where it's closer to my house, and they are checking my car as well as fixing the fog light. Much more friendly service, and the manager is actually on the floor checking with his employees and customers to make sure they are getting treated right. Much different environment then Mckenna where the manager is just in his office.

Hope this review helps Mckenna give better service to other customers moving forward.",1
3,16-Sep-19,"I bought a 428 from Mckenna about 5 years ago.  I was given inaccurate information from Mckenna's staff which led me to purchase a useless warranty that frankly I am shocked they would even offer to see in the first place!  This 'extended warranty' would add basically zero value or benefit beyond the CPO warranty.  So why would a reputable dealer even offer this to a customer if they're seeking to treat a customer right and create a long term relationship?  Wouldn't a reputable dealer recommend Against a customer paying for a warranty of such little value?!  

Recently I've come to learn that the extended warranty they sold me did not extend the CPO  warranty even though I specifically discussed that point with their staff, who confirmed it would be an extended warranty above and beyond the CPO warranty.  They also confirmed I could transfer it with the car when selling it to another.  I purchased it There would have been zero value in purchasing it otherwise.  

I've attempted to address this issue with McKenna believing it was possibly an errant mistake by their staff who didn't understand what they were selling.  In response to my query, McKenna replied they could sell me an additional extended warranty!  How exactly is this treating a customer properly?  A business gives inaccurate information, and then expect the customer to pay more?!    Incredibly disappointing!  

Maybe I should have scoured the paperwork me intently, but when working with a reputable group you hope to have some reliability in their guiding you with accurate information through the dozens and dozens of pages being signed.  Be wary!",1
4,27-Aug-19,"I would like to start the review by saying our sales agent was great (Thanks Omar). The finance department (Markus Jahr) leaves a lot to be desired. We had arranged financing with our Credit Union prior to our purchase, and let them know of that fact. We filled out an Option Contract, and figured the Credit Union and the Dealership would get everything handled. One week later, and my Credit Union has been leaving messages, and not a single reply from McKenna BMW. The Credit Union knew of the timing of the Option Contract, and Certified mailed the check out. Still no call back from them. For comparison, our last purchase at Porsche Irvine was set up the same way, and went with out a hitch, Dealership and Credit Union worked everything out, and I did not have to lift a finger. Maybe due to the Porsche being a new car and this purchase being a used car? Does not seem like good business to me.",1
5,12-Aug-19,Once  we found the exact car we wanted we were lead to McKenna BMW and it couldn‚Äôt have been a more positive experience. This is my third BMW and McKenna has provided the best service I‚Äôve had at any BMW dealership!,5
6,25-Jul-19,"I recently brought my vehicle in to have the BMW connected app looked at per BMW North America/BMW Genius. Service manager Daniel Saldana met with me and as I was showing him the problem on my phone and in the car he notice a smell of oil coming from the engine area. He immediately advised me that they will take a look at it and also since I was close to my next oil change he advised to get that done as well since they were going to have the vehicle. The way he handled the situation was as if it was his vehicle and it made all the difference. He advised me of a loaner vehicle(BMW üëç)and told me he will contact me once they're done with my car. He was very professional and provided excellent customer service.  Most people take time to complain about an issue or a problem but in this case I want to take time out to recognize Daniel Saldana and his wonderful customer service.  As I mentioned to him even though I purchased my vehicle at Beverly Hills BMW,  Mckenna BMW of Norwalk will be my dealer of choice for all of my service needs and any future BMW purchase in the future due to Daniel's outstanding customer service. Kudos to you Daniel and thanks. ",5
7,21-Jul-19,"Lina @ mckenna is the best, took all our vehicle for service, she took care all my vehicles. Great communication! Would recommend to everyone in need to get their service done at mckenna",5

10,18-Jun-19,"I had a 7 am appointment, the process didn't take more than 10 minutes, I was dropped home and was picked up few hours later to get my car. The courtesy and good service is what makes me return for all my car needs ",5
11,16-Jun-19,"Recently I visited McKenna BMW, I had my 2018
430i serviced. I needed a oil change and they checked other fluids too. Lina was our representative and she asked where we wanted to go while the work was being done. She setup Uber to take us to the Cerritos Mall. That was fun and she gave us a digital link to contact Uber to pick us up. When we came back the car had the oil change and had been washed. All in all a very nice experience. Can‚Äôt want to come back and do it again. Bought my wife a BMW hat , we like the gift shop and smoothie shop. Lina is very professional and answered all my questions. Thanks Lina for. Really good experience. Art Morales",5
12,05-Apr-19,"The McKenna Finance Department gave false information about the cost of the maintenance program. After repeated phone calls and emails to the finance department, we were informed both my husband and I needed to come in person to the dealer. We made the 4 hour round trip and have just learned the paperwork we signed was never submitted. We have now been paying for the program for over 3 months that we thought was cancelled. The finance adviser (Laurence) is no longer with McKenna (for good reason).  Our sales person Omar was great and I love my car. Be VERY cautious when dealing with the finance department.",1.6
13,27-Feb-19,"outstanding staff, outstanding product, overall joy. this is my second lease here and most likely will come back for my 3rd. big thanks to calvin, omar, and tony the genius and tony cruz for doing the lease inspection. ",5
14,27-Feb-19,was able to walk away with a great deal on a service loaner and I am beyond elated! I came in for a new x1 but wanted a lower payment so stanley suggested that we take a stab at service loaners and it worked out with LITTLE and i mean LITTLE negotiating. I am very happy,5
15,27-Feb-19,"the sales team(stanley, tony, lawrence) were incredible. absolute pros, I was in and out in a matter of 2 hours and was able to spend the rest of the day enjoying my 430 converty",5
16,24-Feb-19,My oh my... I get a brand new X5 every 3 years and I only drive X5s. I had no idea that this new one is so crazy!! Angel did all the work in getting me exactly what I want. I love the lease to own option to lower my monthly payment every month. She did a splendid job in handling everything for me. She had Arthur come out to get me all situated in my brand new baby. I loved this entire experience and this new X5!!,5
17,22-Feb-19,I drove a long way to see my guy Art. He is splendid at his job. It all started when he and Dave brought my M3 down to my house a few years back. I come by for questions now and again. I am in a 330e now and still am coming for questions. He's great.,5

19,20-Feb-19,Came back to learn about my new 3 series. Glad I did. Arthur was smart and helpful. Good job young man. good job mckenna bmw,5
20,19-Feb-19,"Arthur was very helpful ,kind and pleasant.. ..one of the best people I have dealt with. He helped me and my wife immensely with every step of the process without applying any sort of pressure. I would highly recommend working with Arthur, infect suggest requesting him when you plan visit the showroom. He is very sincere, thoughtful and considerate.",5
21,19-Feb-19,Look.... I never ever write reviews for anybody ever. I have been dreading to get a new car for a long time. The dealerships are always shady and you really can't trust what anyone says. I was lucky to have met Omar... He was so nice and he had everyone like Calvin and Arthur help me out as well with the pricing and finding me the right car. Everyone did a great job and there's nothing less of that here with this experience. I love my new BMW and I cannot be happier.,5
22,18-Feb-19,"Much like going to our physician or dentist, many people possess a strong disdain for purchasing a new vehicle or going to the mechanic.  A shared feature of all these professions relies on a large asymmetry of knowledge. Essentially any information told to you we assume to be presented honestly and in good faith, because speaking for the public majority, we wouldn‚Äôt really know the difference. What mechanics and a large proportion of the automotive industry unfortunately lack, however, is any sense of integrity or fraction of honesty, as highlighted by the series of unevents unfolding over a period of three months with BMW Mckenna located in Norfalk, CA. 

My  2018 X5 was delivered to my apartment in West Hollywood on November 19th, 2018, right before Thanksgiving. Prior to delivery, minor damage noted on passenger side of bumper in front. Because they were in ‚Äúsuch a rush‚Äù to sign for the car, car was delivered before I was leaving town for a week, and it was told to me that car would likely be fixed by time I get back (and it would be picked up as mitigate any inconvenience this would pose to me). 

However, this was delayed because it was Thanksgiving.

Then it was further delayed because then they only picked up vehicles on Thursday. 

Proceeding forward through Christmas/New Years, then it was getting further delayed because they didn‚Äôt have an adequate amount of staff and didn‚Äôt want to ‚Äúspend the $500 towing it on a flatbed out here and indicates that he (I) don‚Äôt care if that‚Äôs what Victoria told him.‚Äù (Victoria was the customer sales manager, no longer works there‚Ä¶.hmmmmmm wonder why?)

I then sent a tactful, yet politely constructed message to Danny Mckenna, which btw, went unanswered by all parties copied in on this message for OVER 48 hours‚Ä¶

‚ÄúPrior to addressing my most current issue, I would like to highlight I was told to reach out if help ever needed and that my business through McKenna BMW was appreciated shortly after getting my 2018 BMW X5 just a short time ago.

To follow up on that, please refer to content within text message below sent to Danny‚Äôs cell phone below on 2/1/2019. I did not receive a response or phone call, so perhaps e-mail as a medium for communication will achieve better success. 

""Good morning Danny! Apologies should this message find you too early, but I did want to relay a bit of feedback regarding the recent leasing of my 2018 X5 xDrive40e. First and foremost, I absolutely love the car. It is my third BMW to date, and is by far my favorite. However, I would like to relay that prior to being delivered, a bit of damage was noted to the front of the vehicle, and even prior to delivery, I was told by various different parties--sales manager, the broker I utilized--that this would be fixed at a time of my convenience, where the car would be picked up from my apt and an equivalent or better loaner car left, while the repair was being completed. I was more than understanding, and with the implied urgency of the deal agreed to these terms. Following this, I was away for several holidays (Thanksgiving, XMAS, New Years), and was told the day of car pick-up would be on Thursday. I have been in excess of 7 calls to the number on the slip provided, only to be bounced around from department to department, only to reach dead ends and have no one return my calls. It wasn‚Äôt until my broker reached out, that any sort of response was given, where I was told the car could not be picked up for repair with a loaner swapped as promise. Suffice to say, I‚Äôm unsure as to why no one in sales/repair/etc could get back to me, despite numerous attempts to touch base, and also, why the dealership is not honoring what was promised and agreed to both prior and during car delivery? Thanks in advance for clarifying. Apologies for lengthy text message prior to regular business hours. Regards, Dr. Dylan Sallerson‚Äù

Subsequently, my broker has spoken with Calvin and GM, who did say, should I drop off vehicle myself, they would provide a rental car at minimum equivalent to mine, or better, to accommodate for the inconvenience and that things would be handled appropriately. 

What is NOT appropriate is providing me with a smoke-infused Cadillac, well below what would be considered equivalent to my current vehicle. 

I subsequently went through the trouble of finding an enterprise location that does have an equivalent BMW to mine (or better) and provided Calvin with the contact details to confirm that it would be OK for me to swap cars. 

Calvin proceeded to say that he was unable to do this, and could only provide a BMW X1 or X3 at best, if I drive back out to dealership to swap. 

Is an X1 or X3 an equivalent vehicle or better?

Please advise as to why this solution seems appropriate, and suggest how this is a reflection of business that is appreciated at your dealership.

Your prompt attention and response to this matter are greatly appreciated. 

Thank you in advance.‚Äù

Following this e-mail, communication was extremely sparse, always initiated by me, and I Was frankly meant to feel like they were doing me some HUGE favor, by merely completely something they promised they would do. I‚Äôm well aware this car is no an 8 series or 6+ figures, but it‚Äôs still an $80,000 which is not an insignificant amount of money. Service should at least ATTEMPT to parallel the product. 

They did manage to delivery an x3 to me in Hollywood. One day later, a tire went flat (Run flat) and they THEN tried to charge me for that. When I looked for a spare tire in the car, the customer or staff member utilizing the loaner car before me felt the need to leave a lovely set of doggy training piss pads along with an assortment of Legos. At this point, I couldn‚Äôt help but laugh at how comically ridiculous the whole saga was.

When collecting car, the saga came to a hilarious end as Danny Mckenna the president and owner‚Äôs son I presume (Hutton) was on standby only to say they would ‚Äúlet the tire thing go‚Äù if I promised to never return there again for business. 

This clearly didn‚Äôt have to be stated, which made the situation that much more of a joke. I absolutely LOVE BMW and have been a loyal customer for years, but it really is unfortunate when you get people that have to represent your brand and put such an incredible tarnish on your name.


With a dealership that clearly does not appreciate business from it‚Äôs customers, and fails to provide a tolerable level of customer service, save yourself the time and effort and go to ANY other BMW dealership.

A succinct summary to consider before wasting your time--Unprofessional, disingenuous, dishonest, lack of attention to detail, poor communication, misleading, arrogant, and a strong lack of product knowledge. Why bother? I can only imagine what this experience would have been like without my broker (Brandon@insiderautos.com)‚Ä¶thank god for him.

23,16-Feb-19,"My husband and I recently stopped into McKenna BMW to see about trading in our old car in for a new BMW. We were greeted by Omar, who was WONDERFUL! He really listened to what we were looking for and didn't waste our time. We even originally wanted a 4 series that was more expensive than our final choice and he helped us see why a slightly more affordable 330i would actually suit our needs a little more. After helping us to try out a few options, we realized his recommendation of the 330i was what we really needed. Omar and Calvin, the Sales Manager, really worked out an incredible deal for our trade-in and the price. Lawrence in Finance was really nice and made the paperwork part of the process more fun by just chatting with us and joking as we signed and reviewed. When we finally had the car, a BMW ""Genius"" Arthur came out and walked us through everything in the car. Omar had already done a great job of showing me most things during the test drive, but the Genius did a good job of covering everything else, plus doing little things like pairing my iPhone to the car!  Since then, we have had great communications with them.Wonderful experience and an incredible vehicle!  We will be loyal in the future! ??????????",5
24,12-Feb-19,"A few days ago I purchased a 2019 BMW X5. It was a great experience. So many thanks to Calvin, the sales manager, Stanley, the sales representative and Arthur for genius assistance. Stanley is a person with a broad range of experience and valuable information that helped us for choosing the best option.",5
25,08-Feb-19,"McKenna BMW has been great since the first day I walked through the doors of the dealership.  My sales rep Angel, has gone more than far and beyond her duties.  Her customer service skills are impeccable and she is an asset to any company.  Not only did Angel assist me with my vehicle purchase, but she also assisted me in having the genius Arthur show me all the features so I wouldn't be inconvenienced with having to figure it out myself. I could not be more satisfied.  Thanks, Angel, greatly appreciated man!  
As far as service department they have excelled as well.  They greet you with a smile each visit no matter what time of day it is or how many customers they have waiting.  They never leave you waiting around and always keep you informed of vehicle status.  
I would definitely refer a friend or family member to Angel for vehicle needs and will definitely return myself when I'm in need for another car, but with BMW reliability I don't think that will be for a long time.

Thanks, McKenna BMW!",5
26,06-Feb-19,"Excellent customer serice. Professional from the time you walk in the door to purchase and/or obtain service. Sakes department is efficient, quick, and provides honest assessment. Special thanks to Omar Z. and Arthur S. in sales.",5
27,05-Feb-19,Deals come and go‚Ä¶ I slept on a deal back a few months and that messed it up real bad. The team here at McKenna helped a heck of a lot to get me the closest deal to what I had before. Angel and Calvin moved heaven and earth for me. I appreciate their efforts and they had this genius guy arthur come help me with the car too. The experience was worth the few extra bucks. I will be sending my buddies this way for a new car.,5
28,01-Feb-19,"I was in an accident that totaled my X3 and I cant even begin to express how upset i was... however, I sent an inquiry to see if I was able to get into another 2018 x3 and Stanley was able to help me out. Not only did he put me into another x3, but my payment was lower as well!!! Thank you!!",5
29,01-Feb-19,"We came in looking for something that would be a little more fuel efficient than our audi and we decided to test drive the x5 diesel. Julian was our sales person and he was absolutely patient. Initially we test drove a dark grey x5d with tony the genius but decided that it wasn't the right color and luckily, julian was able to find a car similarly equipped but in a white! however it was at a different dealership but julian said that we would be able to get it without any problem and he executed. julian displayed professionalism and a lot of patience and I am beyond appreciative. thanks julian and those that helped him along the way!(joe, tony, robert)",5
30,01-Feb-19,"Came to Mckenna BMW with my partner to meet Omar who had the m235i ready for the test drive and after that it was clockwork.. Negotiating was quick, omar got us into finance and by the time we got out, the car was being filled with gas. Tony introduced himself as a genius to pair our phones, answer questions and then we were off. Our experience should be how car buying should be.",5
31,31-Jan-19,"Wow, what a surprise... buying a car can be enjoyable! Omar my Client Advisor, at McKenna BMW is personable, friendly and Arthur my BMW Genius was knowledgeable about the vehicles.

33,28-Jan-19,I got my car from Shelly BMW and they didn't really help me out with anything. I came to McKenna BMW to buy some parts for my new 4 series and asked for a genius' help with my Connected App. Arthur got everything working for me. Good job!,5
34,28-Jan-19,I don't write reviews unless people actually deserve the praise and recognition. I'd like to thank the team at McKenna BMW and especially Arthur. He handled my issue very carefully and was extremely patient with me. I have been having so much problems with my new X5 and the technology itself... Arthur sat me down and went step by step with me until I understood everything clearly. He is a very good at what he does. Thank you. ,5

36,20-Jan-19,Arthur is the best - he goes over everything clearly and offers the best ways to use our beautiful vehicle. I have come to him for my 3rd BMW now. He is one of the reasons I bought another BMW.,5
37,19-Jan-19,My broker Chris helped me do negotiate everything for my 2019 X5. I was very impressed with the speed and knowledge the people at McKenna provided me.

Good team and good prices.,5
38,13-Jan-19,"Great experience-traded in my tired little Lexus for a gorgeous new BMW. Angel was beyond helpful during our experience--especially with me being new to the BMW world.

40,08-Jan-19,Victoria's team works fast and are good at what they do. Victoria has been selling my family cars for over 10 years. She quoted me the best possible price and then Arthur got all the paperwork done and signed everything with me in under 20 minutes. Tony taught me all about my brand new car. I love the experience and ease with Victoria.,5
41,29-Dec-18,"Can't thank Omar, Arthur, and the team at McKenna BMW Norwalk enough for getting me a fantastic new ride! They were friendly, professional, FAST, and just an overall pleasure to shop with. 
I contacted Omar before my lease ended and within a few days Omar went above and beyond providing me with amazing options and prices. The whole process was quick and painless. 
Definitely contact them before venturing out on your own, they're doing great work.",5

45,22-Dec-18,"Absolutely a pleasure to deal with. The sales department is one of the very best. Manager Calvin, salesman Stanley, and genius Arthur are very professional, trustworthy and are committed to deliver the best service. They are the best car sales out there.",5
46,19-Dec-18,"I just finished my purchase at McKenna for a new 330e.  I have to say, the staff there were courteous, proactive (they took the time to reach out to me first after I made a inquiry on Costco), and they had a no-nonsense approach to sales.  It was an excellent buying experience and one that went smoothly as well as quickly.  I have to also give a hand to Stanley, the sales rep who closed the sale with me and Arthur, the genius who delivered me the car.  He went the extra mile to help us out with our 330e purchase.  Definitely a class act, and a great salesman.  I would not hesitate to come back again for future vehicle purchases!",5
47,16-Dec-18,"I was referred from my friend to the BMW Genius, Tony. I had an Encore appointment with him a while back and he explained precisely on all the functionality of my 530e. He went into detail on when I should use the edrive modes, pretty much all around general advice on how to maximize the car. Big ups to his great service. Mckenna has really friendly staff members and I've had a pleasant experience every time. I highly recommend Mckenna BMW and if you have tech questions about your vehicle, ask for Tony",5
48,16-Dec-18,"I just wanted to start out by saying as a person with a family who has leased over 10+ cars, ive enjoyed this one the most thanks to our salesman Stanley. I called in and he took his time to answer all my questions and I decided to come down after having the appointment scheduled!

The professionalism that was brought to the table was beyond what I am used to in the car sales world. Stanley was transparent, pressure-free and there wasn't any haggling involved. Straight to the chase, no BS.

The buying experience was so good and considering the service dept is attached to the sales dept, I may make the extra trip to service the car here. At first I felt like the car was out of the range I had hoped to spend, but Stanley was so pleasure, whats another $20-$30 a month. He even got me a mug and some key chains!

Very professional, changed my view on sales in the car business! Thanks to Stanley and his crew(Lawerence, Tony)",5
49,16-Dec-18,"Walked out with more than just a car, also created a friendship along the way. Whenever an issue or question arises, I will contact farley directly. he had the solutions and answers for my remaining payments and my trade in.

50,14-Dec-18,My mom has been struggling with the new car's technology since she's gotten the car. The ca was a bit advance for her and she most definitely was not enjoying the car. Arthur reached out to me and we set up an appointment with him for a tutorial. It completely changed the outlook that we had on the technology. My mom loves the feeling of feeling like a techie. We are very impressed with Arthur and his work. Thank you for walking us through everything!,5
51,14-Dec-18,"My coworker told me to call McKenna BMW because he leased there and I was looking for my 4th BMW and needed it quick.  In other words an easy sale for a $50,000 car.  I called and spoke to Miguel who told me he would search for the car and payment and get back to me in 20 minutes. I called him back after not hearing for an hour and fifteen minutes and also never receiving any text from him he told me he was spending with his number. I had to leave a message because he was busy.  I called back another hour later, still not hearing and was told he was at 7-11 getting a drink but would be right back. No call back the entire night, but even better yet, no call back the next day either. He just wrote the sale of a BMW SUV off because apparently Miguel sells more cars then he needs to and didn‚Äôt need another sale. After not hearing back from Miguel I called and asked for a manager and was given the voicemail of Calvin Lau, the general sales manager, so I left a message stating I was not called back and need to buy a car very quickly if he could help me out. Apparently Calvin sold too many cars today too because he never called me back either.  It‚Äôs funny, it would have been my 4th BMW and I really wanted the car, scheduled time today to go buy it, but McKenna BMW doesn‚Äôt want to sell cars I guess and they had all the business they needed.  Well, like I said, I need to buy a car quickly so I went to a dealer that wanted to sell cars and bought myself that car that was $51,235, I feel like the owner of McKenna would probably be sad that happened as they lost a good sale today but more importantly they lost a multiple owner BMW customer to an Audi dealership that they have nothing to do with. As a manager of sales people I would be really upset if I heard a customer called to buy and my sales people didn‚Äôt call back losing the sale. ",1
52,14-Dec-18,Had a great experience working with Angel and Arthur on my new vehicle. They were very knowledgeable about my options and was able to get me a deal on my car within my budget.

First, he got right got back to me when I needed a repair estimate to help me evaluate the need for an insurance claim.

On the morning of the scheduled recalibration appointment, my family's second car suffered a disabling ignition circuit failure. (It's still in the shop as I write.) On very short notice, Robert got back to assure me to that a loner car could be arranged. The loaner was a pleasure, too, by the way.
In the end, our i3  became available ahead of schedule, but I couldn't take advantage of the opportunity for an early pick-up. Robert got me in and out of my 8 o'clock check-in appointment  in record time.

We drove there in our previously leases BMW to trade it in as it was extremely quick. I was in and out with my new car in less than an hour. Bob in the Fleet department was informative yet quick and to the point. I would highly recommend this dealership to anyone.,5
252,13-Mar-18,Everyone was really helpful. Will recommend to all my family and friends.  I should be able to put as many words as I like and not a specific amount!!!,5
253,13-Mar-18,"My experience at McKenna was exceptional!  There was no run around and I got exactly what I wanted at the price I requested. Corry Polk was straightforward, honest, and easy to deal with. I am definitely recommending this dealership to friends and family if they are ever in the market for a new vehicle. Truly professional and excellent customer service!!!",5
254,12-Mar-18,"A pleasant and unexpected surprise to deal with such professional people who understand the stress involved in purchasing a new car. Stu, Corey and Genius John couldn‚Äôt have been more helpful or fun to work with. An entirely enjoyable experience and well worth the trip from the valley to Norwalk. ",5
255,09-Mar-18,"Victoria Huang and Bob and one of the assistant 
( don‚Äôt know his name ) are the best team.  
They made my car shopping pleasant ! 
Very happy with my second BMW purchase from them ! ",5
256,08-Mar-18,Corry Polk found all the features I was looking for in my new car and then some!!  He was very efficient and had all my paperwork done and pre-approval before I arrived. Would definitely work with him again on my next car buying experience. ,5
257,07-Mar-18,Lina is the best; she takes good care of my visit and the car was in good hand. Thanks Lina for her fast and experience in customer service.,4.6
258,06-Mar-18,"Noah picked up the ball, after a fumble, and followed through.  He was able to deal with a trade in, and cut a good lease deal.",5
259,05-Mar-18,Corry Polk really came through for us! He found exactly what we were looking for and made our car buying experience a breeze. Thank you Corry! We will be long term customers!,5
260,05-Mar-18,"Maria is the absolute best!!! Always provides superior service, and keeps me in the loop as to what is going on with my car. She knows how to handle customers correctly.",5

262,01-Mar-18,"I have been a loyal customer to McKenna for over a decade.  They are always professional and spot on when it comes to service of my 2003 330ci (manual transmission).  With nearly 1/4 million miles, my 330ci is my daily commuter.  I have two other dealers closer but I prefer McKenna for how they treat me better.
My recent visit was for a oil change plus questions concerning continued upkeep of my older 2003.  Daniel answered my questions and got me checked in relatively quickly.  Dealership provided a courtesy Uber ride to the Norwalk Green Line Station for work.  Later that morning Daniel emailed me that my 330ci was ready.  Dealership provided a courtesy Uber back from the Norwalk Green Line Station to their location.  I saw Daniel has busy with another customer and paid the cashier.  The vehicle was washed and ready for me to head home.  Cost was about the same as I would have paid at a BMW independent mechanic.  
Watch for the dealer's specials!  It is what brings me in for periodic maintenance issues such as oil change, brakes, fluid changes and other things.  
It is worth it to have the professionals check the vehicle out!",5
263,01-Mar-18,"I came in this morning for my Encore appointment with Arthur. It was pretty hectic because it was the end of the month, but Arthur was exceptional. He allocated very valuable time for me and taught me all about the car. I knew he was busy because of all the phone calls he got while we went over things, but he did not rush things at all. I am very happy with my experience.",5
264,01-Mar-18,"I got my first BMW ever today and it was a wonderful experience! Arthur, Tony, and Corry helped me out and got me into a 328d. It was an amazing deal and I was in and out of finance really quickly. I assumed that I was going to be there until 9pm but I was in and out within 1 hour.",5
265,28-Feb-18,Hutton is the best!  He drove to my work just to make it super convenient for me to sign the paperwork!  Such an easy process!,5
266,28-Feb-18,"I have an older BMW (2007 3 Series Convertible) that I did not buy at this dealership however for reasons of convenience I have brought it to McKenna BMW on a couple of occasions.  Each time I have been received warmly in a timely and professional manner.  On today's visit I was assisted by Daniel Saldana, one of their service advisors.  Daniel was friendly and very helpful.  I was there for an airbag recall however I also had a smaller part that had come off of the convertible roof mechanism.  Even though it was a mostly cosmetic issue, I was wary of what it could cost to fix (you know how it goes with foreign vehicles).  Daniel checked out the part and immediately pulled a screwdriver out of his desk and start fiddling with it.  About a minute later we walk out to the car and he pops it back into place!  I had tried the same but the part wouldn't stay on.  Thanks to Daniel it stuck this time around!  The visit went smooth and I was treated with great courtesy.  Daniel set me up with a free Uber ride home and has texted me a couple of times since to keep me updated on the vehicle.  On the way out I went by there snack shop for a refreshment and since I was there for a service visit it was complimentary.  Really a perfect visit!  Thank you Daniel and McKenna BMW.  I'll be pulling the trigger soon on my next BMW and when I do I will be buying with you guys!",5
267,28-Feb-18,Tony reached out to me via to schedule an encore appointment and I was pleased that he did! I had a few questions about setting up apple carplay and Tony was able to walk me  through the process and went into detail on how to use it! After the encore I was able to get my car washed so I was very happy with the experience overall!,5
268,28-Feb-18,The staff at mckenna bmw was amazing! I worked with Julian and he went up and beyond to make sure we found the right car and worked to achieve payment I had in mind! Also would like to thank Julian for introducing me to Tony the product specialist. He assisted me with the delivery of my new 430i and he made sure i was completely comfortable before I took off! Thank you again and I will be recommending Mckenna to my friends and family,5
269,26-Feb-18,Great service.  They had the car ready before promised. The waiting lounge was great. Just great service overall from the minute i pulled up.  Charlie service advisor was super!,5

You have earned our business and look forward to getting more cars from you guys in the future!,5

273,20-Feb-18,"We went to purchase a pre-owned car from Victoria. She gave us very good pricing and it was quick and easy. Arthur helped and was very educated, patient, and made time for us. Victoria had our best interest and went above and beyond our expectations. ",5

275,16-Feb-18,Daniel Saldana continues to provide my wife and I with Superior Customer Service whenever we take are cars in to McKenna. I would suggest that you give Daniel a try when you bring your car to BMW !,5
276,16-Feb-18,"Daniel was great at taking care of my bmw m4 oil change, he even went the extra mile to let me borrow his portable phone charger as well as pulling my car up for me when it was done. Give him a raise !",5
277,16-Feb-18,"We had a great buying experience with Mitzi. She was extremely patient and very helpful. She kept us informed at all times.I will recommend this dealership to my family and friends.
Thank You!

Efrain Garcia",5
278,13-Feb-18,"We had a great buying experience with Corry Polk. He was extremely patient with my wife - back and forth, back and forth - on her choice of models, colors and options. 

She makes good decisions, just not fast decisions. That's my story and I'm sticking to it. 

Arthur took care of us from selection through delivery. He even took the time to work with their detailing department to polish up our BMW. 

We could not be happier. Highly recommended.",5
279,13-Feb-18,Arthur Szeto truly helped us through the process of getting our new BMW.  He was extremely knowledgeable about all the BMWs.  He was flexible and responsive even when we changed our minds several times for the BMW Encore appointment.,5
280,09-Feb-18,Guy took care of the service to my vehicle effortlessly.. I was kept informed at all times and my car was ready on time promise.,5
281,05-Feb-18,"Thanks to Noah, Dominic and Nadine for an excellent experience with our second lease of an i3.
The price was good, the new car was in good shape, and my spouse ,who was experiencing temporary health issues during the handover of the old car and the delivery of the new one, was well accommodated. 
That's the basis for my current five star rating of McKenna Sales. The four star overall dealership rating above is generous rating. It's based on a number of previously experienced quality control issues with the McKenna Service Department. My previous 2014 model i3 lease had a persistent service issue that McKenna failed to chase down before our three year lease was up.",4
282,05-Feb-18,Patrick got me interested the 540i and finally sold by Omar. great working with both and everyone at dealership made it a great buying experience. Thanks guys!!   ,4.7
283,04-Feb-18,"My advisor was the best . Very atttentive I would recommend him.  Guy was on top , best service I had. I had service on my car before and never like this . First time I have my car wash. Gut was extremely detailed , definitely I come back for service and ask for him. ",5
284,01-Feb-18,"My lease was coming to end and I brought my 4 series in to upgrade into an x5 and Robert made it so easy and painless, we were in and out within 2 hours. This is my second time here and no doubt I will be back when this new lease is up! Thank you again to Robert for the great deal and Tony for handling the delivery process!",5
285,01-Feb-18,I brought my 540i in because there was issues with the connectivity and a service adviser introduced me to tony who was a product specialist! Tony was able to fix the issue by restarting the idrive and it finally connected! He also spent a few minutes going over the car as well!,5
286,28-Jan-18,"Walking into your dealership my wife and I had no knowledge about BMW, but your salesman Byron Action Jackson, was very educational and patient and truly lived up to his name, so much that on the way home we both knew we would be returning the next day to make our purchase",5
287,28-Jan-18,"Robert brought the human aspect to my visit. He was very friendly, kept me informed and wasn‚Äôt trying to move me on as just another number. ",5
288,26-Jan-18,Bought a CPO BMW from McKenna and Corry gave me a great deal.  I also took advantage of the genius service with Arthur.  Highly recommended.,5
289,25-Jan-18,Came in to the dealership for maintenance and it‚Äôs always a pleasant greet from Carlos. Armando has always answered  or addressed my issues with proper attitude and  promptness. I really appreciate all the service personal and I haven‚Äôt had any issues in the 6 Years I been going to McKeena of Norwalk.,4.6
290,20-Jan-18,Sales department is great. Service department is the most disorganized service department I've ever worked with. Car has 2000 miles on it. Check engine light comes on. Call next day for an appointment and they scheduled for two days out. Take care in only to be told they have only a few technicans that can work on the hybrid cars. They also told me that they had others that had been waiting for over 7-9 days for repair and I'd be after that. After talking to the assistant service manager because the service manager never returned my call I was basically told this is a common problem with the hybrids. I said why didn't the sales people tell me this before I bought the vehicle? He said sales team doesn't always knows what goes on the service side. I said then why when I called to make an appointment that there would be this long of a delay. Once again the excuse was they are just paid to answer phones and take appointments. Sounds like the BMW McKenna family needs to collaborate more. The only thing positive out of my experience so far was I was given a loaner. The loaner nowhere compares to my 5 series lease. Beyond disgusted and regretting buying a hybrid car from BMW. Still waiting for my car to be returned. You have been warned.,1
291,20-Jan-18,"No matter what the issue is we get the greatest service.  With 3 different BMW's and lots of mileage we are there a fair amount for service or a nail in a tire on occasion.

Daniel Saldana and Maria are the best service advisors I could ask for although we typically work with Daniel and Danny in the loaner department is on tom of his job.

Thanks for the great service and that's why we have 3 of your cars.",5
292,19-Jan-18,"I LOVE McKenna BMW!!!! They are the best dealership around!
I have bought a total of 12 cars from them over the years & my experience is always awesome!
I would never buy a car anywhere else EVER!
I tell everyone I know to go there & I always get positive feedback.
McKenna BMW is the BEST! ",5
293,18-Jan-18,I purchased a used 528 a month ago and i could not figure out why my bluetooth music was not playing and the navigation from my phone was not coming through the speakers. Stopped by the dealership and Daniel Solis was able to work around the issue by repairing my phone and guiding me back to the steps to using it. ,5
294,18-Jan-18,"They had me in and out very fast, with a great rental and I had my car back the next day. Very satisfied with the entire process. ",5
295,17-Jan-18,"Appreciate the staff there. All employees are great!! Very friendly but most importantly, doing their job. Thank you Robert! As always, he takes good care of me and my car. ",5
296,15-Jan-18,"Great experience. Bought my X5 M package here. My bmw genius Arthur was extremely nice and knowledgeable, as well as Billy the sales manager. It didn‚Äôt even felt like a car dealership, it was more like visiting some folks and talk about cars.  I was there on 12/29 and they were very busy but it was the shortest amount of time I spend in a car dealership. Lawrence in finance was great as well ( I was in finance for less than 10 minutes). Definitely recommend.",5
297,14-Jan-18,Maria was exceptional!!   She kept me informed of all services performed and update me as my vehicle was being serviced.   It was much appreciated.   Best of all my car was ready when promised.   Keep up the good work !,5
298,09-Jan-18,"Arthur was fantastic.  He went above and beyond to find the 530e I was looking for and he made sure I got all the information I needed.  Also, the finance part was no hassle and quick.  This is the second time I have bought a car from this dealership and I will definitely come back.",5
299,08-Jan-18,"I am very disappointed with the service I received from McKenna BMW. 
1.	I was told by my friends not to go to McKenna dealership because of the bad experiences they had. I still went to your dealership despite what they told me. I regret that I ever went to have my car serviced at McKenna dealership.
2.	I asked Daniel (Service Advisor) and Armando (Service Manager) to call the BMW corporate and ask them if they can replace it without any charges. I purchased additional service and maintained the car according to BMW‚Äôs recommendations. I know enough to know that a water pump does not go out within 5 years unless it is defective or has a problem with it. I also owned a Lexus and a Mercedes Benz and have had no issue with the water pumps for the last 10 years. 
3.	I told Daniel that there was a recall on the 2011 BMW and that maybe I got a bad water pump. (I did not get any support from your service manager in trying to get BMW to resolve this recall on my car). Instead, from my understanding, Armando refused this recommendation to the BMW corporate.
4.	When I went to get a rental, I was told they do not have a BMW. I was given a Maxima. This is the 1st time this has happened to me regardless on which car I have serviced (BMW, Lexus or Mercedes Benz).  I am usually given a loaner car that was either better or equal to what my car that is being serviced. (Note: I did see an BMW at McKenna)
5.	When they asked to check for dents or scratches, it was so dark that I had to trust what they were telling me.
6.	I asked the service manager if he could give me a discount and Daniel told me that they would give me 10% off.
7.	When I asked Daniel to match the quote that I got from another BMW dealership, Daniel asked me give him the information so they can match it. After I sent him the information thru email, he still did not match it and charged me more. I told Daniel and Armando that they did not include the promised 10% discount that I would get.

a.	Daniel and Armando did not match the quote that I gave them. If I had a choice on which dealer to go to, why would I go to the dealer that does not match the best price?
b.	Daniel and Armando did not give me the 10% discount they promised me.

8.	When I asked Daniel if I could have the rental car until the decision is made by BMW regarding coverage, it was refused. Rental car would not be covered he claimed.
9.	I was promised that the car should be done by December 14, 2017. When I called to follow up, they told me that it won‚Äôt be done until December 15, 2017. When I called on December 18, 2017, to let them know that I would pick up my car at 11:00 AM. I was informed it won‚Äôt be done until the evening.
10.	When I took the car in, there was no check engine light but after the service was done, there was a check engine light and they told me it was the oxygen sensor. It seems like your dealership broke it and fixed it temporarily so the light would not appear. How can an oxygen sensor go bad in 5 years?
11.	Armando (Service manager) never responded to my e-mails nor even gave me call back to give me updates. Is this the type of service BMW is giving?
12.	I e-mailed Daniel if I he could send me your e-mail address. I still have not received a response from him. I had to search for it on the website.

McKenna dealership has taken advantage of the situation because I did not have a choice once I brought it to your dealership. With my Lexus and Mercedes dealership, they usually would help me resolve the issue by looking at recalls and try to assist me with probable cause of a possible defect. McKenna dealership did not even spend time to look into it.  It is very disappointing that BMW customer service is not even up to par with any other luxury car dealership.  It does not seem to match with your advertising.

Due to their lack in customer service I decided to drive an extra 35 minutes, just to get the service I deserve. I ended up in McKenna BMW with a bmw genius arthur!  Wow what a difference.

I was not planning to lease a new car but after the friendliness of the staff and test driving the newer 530i, I immediately fell in love! Thank you again to Patrick, Tony and Robert for making the process smooth. Will recommend friends and family to Mckenna!",5

I would definitely recommend McKenna BMW and these two gentlemen to our family and friends for their next BMW purchase.",5
311,23-Dec-17,It was a good experience all around. I had to go to a family dinner and Victoria was able to accommodate me. She was very quick with helping me get through the paperwork and Arthur went over the car with me. I appreciate all the help from everyone!,5

319,16-Dec-17, The staff is friendly and the facility is terrific. In the staging area there is a planter in a concrete container with a very sharp corner. Opening my door resulted in a ding in my door because of the location of the planter. I would definitely rethink this positioning.,4.2

323,11-Dec-17,Jonathan Phan Was my salesman. I don‚Äôt see his name in the options to select. But he made the experience of purchasing my first BMW a wonderful experience. Also Marcos Saines made the experience even better.,5

McKenna BMW had Arthur call me and he was able to help me solve all my issues. I am glad that everything was taken care of because I was very close to not buying another BMW again.,5

336,01-Dec-17,"James was really good at helping me identify and select the features I wanted.  He was patient and willing to spend as much time with as possible.  He knows his stuff; a true professional.  Never did I feel pressured to make any decision. The dealership really needs to work a better closing schedule.  I arrived to pick my car at 4:30 and didn‚Äôt leave until 7:00.  I apparently was in a long line to get to the Finance Department.  Once in Finance, the process went smoothly and painlessly.  That said, because of the hour, I never got the license plate holder properly installed. It‚Äôs a relatively small item in the overall scheme of things.  Nonetheless, I now have to go to dealer to have that done.  I probably will pick a local dealer that task.",4
337,01-Dec-17,"Easiest transaction to receive our desired car with the terms we were happy with.  All done over the phone through a few calls, a few forms filled out online and then our new BMW was delivered to our doorstep that night.  James was a pleasure to deal with.

",5
347,28-Nov-17,"BUYERS BEWARE!!!! This is a very shady dealership. I've been in the Norwalk BMW a couple of times and have been appalled at the customer service in this dealership. I made an appointment with one of your salesman on my first visit only to be ignored for about a half hour. There were many other salesmen and no one acknowledged us.  On our second visit, the car that we negotiated and was promised got sold right before we arrived at the dealership. We fought traffic on a Friday afternoon to come to this location. The salespeople made us sit around for about an hour only to eventually inform us that the car ""just got sold"". The unethical business practices of your salespeople are disappointing and disgraceful. 

I will also be contacting the corporate office of BMW to inform them of the unethical ways of this dealership. I hope that their management team will correct and remedy the behavior of this sales team. 


Just want to let everyone know this is what their GM sent me after I emailed him back. You can judge for yourself if he cares about his customers. 

BTW, the response you see below is an automated response to any negative comments towards the dealership. I would assume they don't have time to really read their unsatisfied customers' comments, which is in line with how they handle their customers. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is their GM responding to me:

I certainly understand your feeling about the treatment you got at our dealership.
I can see based on your Yelp review and your  
Contacting anyone that will listen, that you get the satisfaction that you are seeking.
I hope your campaign works to your satisfaction.
One would think that my apology for whatever happened would have been enough as we are all people.
But apparently, you have decided to go on a campaign

I was pleased with Service Advisor Maria Flores, knowledgeable and friendly, everything went quickly from there and to obtained the loaner car.
This is actually my wife's car, she was pleased with thorough ""Standard Scope"" check-up that was performed on the vehicle, and services detailed was reported in writing upon pickup.

It wasn't until 9:15 that the first service intake person showed up and by 9:22 several others came over from the cafeteria area. Why were all the service intake personnel on break at the same time? Consider staggering breaks or don't schedule appts. during employee breaks to eliminate unnecessary wait times for the people who pay your bills. 

For the actual service on my X3, that was done satisfactorily and the work was completed by about 3PM. ",4.2

366,04-Nov-17,"We first got a Porsche from McKenna in 2013, and we had very good experience with the sales at McKenna Porsche. This year, we got a new BMW from McKenna because they were very willing to work with us for a good deal on the car. We initially did not take the car to McKenna service because there was another BMW dealership closer to us. However, recently, when I had to get two wheels repaired, the other dealership did not try to repair the wheels and tried to make us buy replacements. So we went to McKenna service for a second opinion. McKenna was able to fix the rims with no hassle and our service advisor Guy was very communicative and always kept us posted with updates. 

McKenna provides the best customer service in both the sales and service departments and I would highly recommend both the service and sales departments. ",5

431,11-Jul-17,Noah and Dominic made choosing my vehicle  so easy. Noah knew exactly what to find based on my budget and pointed me in the right direction to find my car. Dominic was extremely helpful when showing me the SUVs and really made the process less nerve recking for a first time buyer. Thank you. ,5
432,10-Jul-17,McKenna BMW staff are really nice and professional people to work with. The process to purchase my new car was simple and effective. Alex in particular is a great sales person. He gives you space to think about these kind of decisions and at the same time he has all the answers for every question you have. He is AWESOME! I would recommend Alex and McKenna BMW to everyone.,5
433,10-Jul-17,I brought my car in for service. They had the car for two days and never looked at it. They never even called me. Just a big waste of time. ,1.7
434,08-Jul-17,"Purchased another special-ordered BMW from Noah and his team again yesterday! I've been a repeated customer for past few years and had referred several friends/family members to him as well! His outstanding service and deals were simply ubeatable! Everybody is extremely satisfied with his professionalism, patience, and most importantly, his willingness to work with you to meet your budget. I would give him/McKenna dealership 100 stars if I can. Will definitely come back for my next vehicle again. Keep up the good work~ ""Happy wife happy life"" LOL!!",5
435,01-Jul-17,"Mitzi is such a nice lady, talking to her is like talking to a friend and from the first day I met her, I felt like she would take good care of me and she did.  If it had not been for Mitzi and her warm personality, I would probably still be looking for a car, she kept in contact with me to make sure that my experience with McKenna BMW would be a good one and believe me, it was the best experience I have ever had purchasing a car.  I am now a proud, first time BMW owner and I owe it all to Mitzi Terrell.  Thank you so much Mitzi.",5
436,30-Jun-17,I went with my aunt and Patrick Kim helped us. Very professional. My aunt was more comfortable in Korean and he was able to accommodate us!,5
437,30-Jun-17,"McKenna is a fantastic dealership with the entire dealership team looking to work with you, from the initial sales contact all the way top to the general manager. They seem to be one of the few dealerships in the Los Angeles area who understand how competitive the market is, and don't mess around trying to pull the usual obfuscating tricks with the customer. When we asked around for quotes, they started off with the best price and didn't try to hide any incentives. Their sales team kept in regular contact, and when we went to finalize the purchase, Khoi Diep, the sales manager was not only able to find us a better equipped car, but also get us a better price on top of working things out with BMW to get us all the incentives we could get. Any concerns or questions we had was immediately expedited and handled promptly - getting back to us even before we expected a response! BMW makes great cars, and McKenna is a dealership where customer service matches the quality of the cars they sell.",5
438,30-Jun-17,Patrick was awsome! He was extremely friendly and professional! I was very happy when I left and would not go anywhere else. He really took care of me and I will always be his client.  Great service and quality work! ,5
439,29-Jun-17,"Yes, the rating I am giving is high and that is because it is well deserved. Buying a new car is overwhelming and I know this since I have avoided the process.  Honestly, I should have come in sooner because Byron Jackson made it so much easier than I made it out to be. Byron and I spoke on the phone and discussed my needs.  I made an appt with him and by the time I arrived he had selected a few options to fit my lifestyle.  He took his time and explained every detail as I tested car as well as the financial options for every scenario. He‚Äôs super expert. McKenna has an 800 car inventory so there‚Äôs little that they don‚Äôt have!! The staff is friendly, helpful and super efficient.  At the end of the process, my car was washed, gas tank full and was even given a one on one service tutorial with Andrea, Product Genius, on how to program my new vehicle. The technology is insane offering an app to program the car!

I‚Äôll be back McKenna!! Byron-Thanks for the amazing experience!",5
440,27-Jun-17,"McKenna BMW has a great team and awesome service!! I came with my sister to look for X1. Stanley was my client advisor. He treated us with a huge smile and made us feel very comfortable. I never owned a BMW, so I had a lot of questions. He showed and explained to us the difference in quality and safety between BMW and other brands. Robert the finance manager was very nice and patient. He helped me to get approved and went over everything with me before I signed contract. It was a memorable experience to purchase a car in McKenna BMW. Stanley and Robert are the best. They made me feel comfortable and not being pushy. Highly recommend McKenna BMW if you wanna get a great deal with best customer service, and make sure you ask for Stanley!!",5

444,14-Jun-17,Initially I rant into a couple of hiccups due to poor communication and misinformation.  I ended up working with Will Shaw who ensured he found exactly what I was looking for and provided excellent customer service and communication throughout.  I finished the transaction with Byron Jackson who was great in making sure I was taken care of and every last detail was covered.  Robert Tarkhanyan was detailed and explained my finance options well while making sure I was happy in the end.  It was a challenge to find what I was looking for and I appreciate the staff who helped make sure it happened and quickly.  I love my car!,4.4

I called in and talked to the client advisor Stanley, make sure the car was still available. When I arrived, Stanley already pulled the X3 at front door and waited for me. It was a busy day but the whole process was so smooth and didn't take very long. I definitely will send everyone I know who is interested in buying a BMW to here. Thanks Stanley for the awesome experience!",5

I got a competitive price on a very nice CPO car.  Free car washes and flatbed service if I want it.  This is the way to run a dealership.  I would definitely buy from McKenna again.",5
451,31-May-17,"It was a great experience dealing with Noah and Dominic. I had to push Noah around alittle and shop the price. didn't offer me the best deal at first. I guess that's good for the dealership.. lol

We gave Marcos all our information the night before, and when we came in this morning, our car was clean, charged and ready to go! The whole process didn't take very long and it was a busy day. Arthur took the time to sit with us and explain everything about the car, down to the mechanics of how the car is powered and all the awesome options! He gave us his personal cell phone to contact him anytime, just in case we had any questions after we left. Our friend is buying another i3 tomorrow from the Marcos and Art Team and we plan on sending everyone we know who is interested in buying a BMW here! Thank you both for the awesome experience!",5
454,25-May-17,"By far the best dealership in LA. The service and attention I received from Corry and his colleagues was astonishing. There was no game playing - they kept there word and delivered even more than they had promised. In all my years of leasing a BMW, I've never had service like this. Corry is on your side and makes sure the deal is heavily favored towards the customer. I'm still blown away by the deal I received.. McKenna + Corry will forever be my go to BMW dealer.

455,24-May-17,Great customer service. They got me in and got me out fast with my new lease. Even came with a genius explanation of the features.,5
456,24-May-17,"I was very impressed with Enrique's follow-up with me and for providing information I needed.  He also provided suggestions on other cars that I should consider which ultimately made me decide to purchase - and ended up being one of the cars he suggested.  Corey was great in negotiating the final purchase price and was very friendly.  Finishing off a great experience was Marcos in finance.  He was very thorough in explaining options with different warranties and was very organized with all the paperwork.  The process of signing was very efficient and detailed and I was surprised on how fast we were done.  I'm usually loyal to previous dealerships I buy from and being my 5th BMW, Mckenna BMW far surpassed what my previous experience with another BMW dealership has been.  ",4.8

458,19-May-17,"I would like to thank you for the wonderful and delightful experience my husband and I had.  We had first went to Shelley BMW, test drove an X3, wasn't what I was looking for, the ambiance there wasn't very pleasant so we decided to leave and go to McKenna.  That was the best choice we made.  The whole experience at McKenna from beginning to end was fantastic!  From our sales person Cory Polk, to our genius Caleb Nichols to our Finance Manager, Marco Saines.  We will definitely be referring friends and family to McKenna BMW.  I love my new X3.

Thanks a million!  You have a very satisfied customer.
Best Regards,

459,17-May-17,"Byron helped me to sell my previous vehicle with a satisfied value and bought me lunch as we talked about numbers. Arthur shows his profession of BMW vehicles, which eventually become more useful than I originally expected. So far I'm happy about my certified 435i cv because all employees there are easy to talk to and I always get the info I need when I leave the dealership. ",5
460,15-May-17,"McKenna BMW always offers me great deal and best customer service! This is my second BMW from McKenna. Stanley was my client advisor and he was so prepared. When I arrived, he already had the car ready for me. He was nice and patient, and he always kept me informed. The used car manager gave me a very fair price on my trade in. It was a great experience to purchase a car in McKenna BMW. Highly recommend McKenna BMW if you are looking for best deal with great service.",5
461,13-May-17,"LOVE these guys!
I am a first time BMW buyer and had tons and tons of questions. I called around and emailed about 9 dealerships and McKenna BMW responded with most courteous, thoughtful, informative, and personable answers. My friends warned me to be skeptical of any sales pitch I get at first, and rightly so, but the team at McKenna made me feel like I can trust what they told me and that feeling paid off. 

Consider the following:
* Get the A-Team of McKenna BMW - Start with Corry Polk, Internet Client Advisor. He was my prompt, responsive, and patient initial contact. Out of 9 dealers, he was the only one who convinced me to come into the dealership. I had a very busy schedule and was not planning on buying a car that weekend. Corry was truly convincing. Then there was Arthur Szeto, their BMW Genius. His knowledge was impressive. He explained things to me in ways that I would understand and was charming to work with. Final shot calling Sales Manager was Khoi Diep. Khoi was candid, straight forward, and fair. Three of them together made an amazing team. Professional & AMAZING!
* Allot a big chunk of your time. I was there from 9am till 3:30pm. There were glitches and kinks from both McKenna and my end during the transaction but Corry, Khoi, and Arthur made it an ""I will come back to do business with these guys again"" experience. 
* Service recovery. I understand that mistakes happen and what's important is how they handle the situation. After I had signed most of the paperwork, I ran into an employee who made me want to almost walk away from the deal. Everything Corry, Arthur and Khoi accomplished could have been ruined. (I am not going to name this person since everyone deserves a second chance.) Khoi stepped in right away and saved the situation. Expertise it took for Khoi to turn my experience around was impressive. 
* Above and beyond service. Why am I writing the longest review of my life for McKenna? Because these guys went beyond what I could possibly expect from any car dealership. The car I drove there was scheduled to be delivered back to me the next day and I was advised to take my new beautiful BMW home. Well, the old car died in their lot and they took care of that car for me as well. 

I will be making my future car purchases from McKenna from now on and I haven't stopped talking about them to my friends and colleagues. Don't forget to ask for Corry Polk, Khoi Diep, & Arthur Szeto!

Overall, best experience I've ever had with a salesperson. He was an absolute pleasure to work with on finding the right car for my family and me. He was patient during the process and answered all my questions. He showed my wife and me multiple cars so that we could get a good feel of what ultimately would be the perfect fit for us.

486,14-Mar-17,"I had been searching for a new car for a while. I had an old 2012 Honda Civic and I just thought it was time to get a new car. I went to many BMW dealers. I went to Alhambra, Downtown, Van Nuys, and even South Bay. I was beginning to give up on the BMW brand because no matter where I went no sales person was able to get me to a close monthly payment that I wanted, since I had a certain budget. I felt that everyone everywhere else was rude and not very helpful. So I decided to try one last dealer ship before giving up. McKenna BMW in Norwalk. I can honestly say that they had the best customer service of all BMW dealers I went to. Corry Polk helped me out with such a patience and care. Honestly, he took his time to explain everything and also get my payment to where I wanted them. No other dealership or sales person helped me out as much as Corry Polk and his finance manager did. He was very sweet and nice. I am sooo thankful for Corry!! Thanks to him and his amazing team I have a new BMW!! I will definitely will be coming back if in the future I need another car or if one of my family members or friends need a car!

489,09-Mar-17,"Came to McKenna after scouring the OC for the right vehicle, deal, trade, and overall experience.  From our Client Advisor Patrick Kim, to their Product Specialist Andrea going with on the test drive to the manager Khoi, it was absolutely the most pain free experience I have *ever* had in purchasing a car.

Patrick mentioned he was only a couple of months in the position, but he was quite knowledgeable and clearly has a passion for the brand.  Super nice guy and very helpful.  Don't hesitate to go see him!

It helped that we knew exactly what we wanted, but that included a fairly aggressive deal that was based on our shopping around that may or may not have still been available.  When negotiations were basically ""I can do that"" with a slight adjustment for the cost bump of an extra option or two, we were floored.  Then going so far as to take a refundable deposit to hold the vehicle for 24 hrs while I completed a separate deal on the trade they likely wouldn't be able to match was awesome.

It was clear we were in the right place for getting into our first BMW!

McKenna will be a name I look for first in the future.",5

495,28-Feb-17,I was first greeted by Allison (bmw genius). We where there just to look into a car we saw online and she took us to see other cars as we then got greeted by Patrick Kim who went to go get the car while she took as to see similiar cars and explain specs of the and other difference between models. Next thing you know their overall just up beat attitude and not very pushy attitude to sell the car but to make sure it's the right car for us led us to talk numbers. There willing to work with price and just overall Patrick's attitude to try to get us a deal we felt good with us made me a proud owners of BMW 428i. We didn't meet one employee that wasn't nice. I worked at a car dealership as my first job and this completely changed my view (bad) of sales man and just the experience of buying a car. I want to thank Patrick Kim and Allison and all the other employees we met.,4.8

501,21-Feb-17,"I leased an i3 this year and was troubled by all the technology that was involved with the car. When you get a BMW you are usually assigned with a BMW genius. If you are able to request someone be sure to request Arthur. He came to my house after I took my car home from McKenna BMW and was patient. He spent a lot of time teaching me about the technologies and operations of the car. 

I appreciate McKenna for providing this service since it saves me a lot of time and the hassle of making an appointment and having to drive all the way to Norwalk. I am happy I with my experience and would like to return in the future. I'd highly recommend coming here if you are ever in need of a BMW.",5

507,09-Feb-17,I had my Encore experience at McKenna BMW.  My Genius Representative was Arthur Szeto.  He is amazing! He was very patient and went over all the features of my new BMW 535i.  He answered all my questions and gave me his contact number if I had questions in the future.  Everything from my car buying experience here at McKenna BMW to the Encore experience was nothing short of outstanding.  ,5
508,07-Feb-17,"We recently purchased a ""certified"" 2013 X5 from this dealer.  Within the first month, we have had the following problems:
- low urea for the diesel engine.  This is supposed to be fill when an oil change is done.  It had not been.
- the rear A/C unit had to be replaced because it was completely dead.  They didn't find this is their 150 point certification inspection?
- the low oil lamp came on.  This vehicle calls for changing the oil every 9,500 miles.  It's been only 4,000 miles, yet the low oil light came on.  

I fear there was little or no inspecting that took place on this vehicle.  To add insult to injury, they charge a $50 fee every time warranty service is performed.  Really?  I have had other manufacturer's certified pre-owned vehicles and never been charged a fee for warranty work.

One last point is that they will not do any work or even check something without you leaving the car for 24 hours.  That means a rental car each and every time, even for an oil change!  It always took an hour and a half to take my care in and get a rental car, then it took a minimum of 45 minutes to pick it up even when the work was already completed and they knew I was coming in.  They do not respect the value of people's time.

I don't know if the lack of quality of service exists across all BMW dealerships or if this one is just particularly bad.  I will soon find out as I will not take my X5 back to this dealer for any future work.",1.6
509,05-Feb-17,Came and learned about my car with Arthur Szeto the BMW genius. He knows what he's talking about and explained everything In great detail. He's super attentive and got me a free car wash too. ,5

Salesman Marcos Lopez.   Marcos listen to what I was interested in, and didn't try to sell me a car that didn't suit my needs or lifestyle.  Marcos was/is personable and friendly, and eager to understand the customer needs without trying to use the stereotypical salesman tactics.  He is a great asset to McKenna BMW.

BMW Genius Arthur is equally good.  He is super knowledgeable about all things BMW. Friendly, and extremely patient. He spent the time to go over all of my car's features.  He answered all of my questions and offered helpful hints to maximize my driving experience.  He is also a great asset to McKenna BMW.    ",4.8

Got to test drive the car with the options i wanted and he was great at showing me the new features of the car.  Researching a car on the internet you can only learn so much, while the actual hands on experience changed my mind on some of the options i wanted.  He brought in multiple cars for me to look at so i could compare how the different optioned packages differed.  After I figured out the exact car i wanted Patrick searched throughout the country to find me a match and was able to even meet my expectations on a great price.  Had a great buying experience compared to my visits to other dealerships.  There was no up sell and that pressure you feel with other salesmen who seem like they are just out to get a commission.  Would not hesitate to refer friends and family to Patrick Kim for a great buying experience.",5

He is very nice and helpful answering all my questions about the car since I am not a car person.  Before I came in, I am only interested in the 4 series convertible because of the design.  But I have changed my mind after meeting with Arthur, he taught me how to use all the features in the car and explained so much about the concepts behind their designs that helps me for a better driving experience.  I appreciate his help, knowledge, and professionalism on helping me with my car and I will definitely come back for other models.",5

527,01-Jan-17,"My husband and I just bought a beautiful BMW M235. We had a great sales person--Daniela Kageyama! She was very competent and helpful. She worked with us for quite some time and made the whole experience very pleasant. She in no way pressured us or made us feel like we had to rush to make up our minds. You could see she really wanted us to get the deal we felt was fair, and she went out of her way to help make that happen. We would definitely return and work with her again--I highly recommend her.

530,31-Dec-16,"As a first time car buying experience, McKenna sets the bar pretty high for future car buying. Patrick was great in making the dealing process easier. He made sure that I was able to test out the cars I was considering and that all financing options were made clear and clarified all questions that I had. Arthur and Marcus, as the Product Geniuses, were extremely informative regarding the cars and the technology in them. Definitely would recommend considering coming to this dealership when considering a BMW. ",4.2

I have shopped around for a week and first time ever I was really feel happy for that price, not just glad but happy. More important, Stanley is so professional and friendly, he helped me find my car package by package, compare with colors, and he took me to check cars one by one, IN THE HELL OF RAIN, everything he did make me feel that I'm really important customer to him and to his company.

532,31-Dec-16,"This was my first experience at McKenna and it was great!

534,30-Dec-16,"When I was looking for my new car, I was extremely nervous. It was a big step for me financially, and I wanted to make sure I didn't jump at the first opportunity. When I came in, Matt Rodriguez made me feel welcome, he was very knowledgeable , and helped me find something right in my price range. He Made this terrifying process fun, thanks Matt! Great experience all around.",5
535,30-Dec-16,"I don't usually write reviews, but this is my 4th BMW and my sales person, Matthew Rodriguez, was AMAZING!!!!  I called to McKenna's internet sales department and spoke with Matthew Rodriguez about a quote on a 2017 X5.  It was the easiest conversation that I have EVER had with a car dealership.  I called up to Matthew quite honestly with a very aggressive deal.  I knew my MF, the residual and the rebates and had 4 other dealerships tell me I was crazy.  Matthew was so upfront and came back with a simple, ""We can do it!"" To be honest, it was so good and easy I thought there might be a hitch.  We called Matthew since we were in the neighhood visiting family for the holidays.  He wasn't working but offered to come in on his day OFF! He sent me updates, and even took video of a car for me. He wasn't pushy, but really went the extra mile.  I have purchased 9 cars.  My husband is not very good at it and doesn't like it. At almost every dealership, the sales people will look to him to make all the financial decisions and discount me when it comes to numbers....VERY annoying.  A salesman at another dealership even referred to me as ""little lady!!!""  I really appreciated that I didn't have to correct Matthew or convince him that I can do the math.  I know how leases work, and he knew immediately that I did, and didn't try to talk down to me or get one over on me.  That is a progressive attitude that I wish more sales people shared. You will NOT be disappointed if you use Matthew Rodriguez at McKenna BMW.  I think it is rare to deal with someone so genuine in a very disingenuous industry.                  ",5
536,30-Dec-16,"Came in today to Mckenna after being to a few other dealerships in the area and had a good experience. The salesman, Matthew Rodriguez, was very friendly and easy to work with.

I highly recommend the dealership and be sure to ask for Matthew.",5

I was very much moved, when we get down to the turkey, the pricing, he started from a fair price and got me a very very good deal, the price is just beautiful.

551,07-Dec-16,"I would give 0 rating if I could, specifically because this is a BMW and I expect exceptional service from them.

I bought my certified pre-owned BMW car from this dealer and it has been OVER 4 months that I have not received spare key for the car or the licence plates. I called up number of times and they keep promising in few weeks but that never happens. 

Really BMW? Do I have to follow up so much on such simple stuff? This is surely not the customer service I expected from a BMW dealer!

Also, they were supposed to offer me a tire warranty when i bought the car. That is BMW policy as per another dealer. But they didnt offer any. I tried calling the finance dept to double check that and request more info on it, I left a voice mail and no one has called back till now.
I ended up paying 400$ for changing my car rear tire instead of a 50$ deductible because of their shoddy paper work and screw up.

I am never going to go back to this dealer or recommend anyone to them anymore. ",2.6
552,30-Nov-16,"I came in not knowing what I wanted. Dominic did an excellent job walking me through the various styles and options. He was very knowledgeable, definitely knew his stuff, and offered genuine feedback based on what I wanted and what was important to me. I felt like I was shopping with a friend, not a salesperson. When I was ready to make the deal, Noah made the transaction seamless and easy. He was very personable, genuine, and gave me a great deal. I left feeling really good and confident about my purchase, thanks to all the great information and guidance. Thanks so much Dominic and Noah! ",5
553,14-Oct-16,"By far the best experience ever purchasing a vehicle! This was my first time purchasing a BMW and was not sure where to start with the buying process but Corry Polk walked me through it all, made it super simply for me to understand the ins and outs of the purchase. Never once did he push me to purchase something I wasn't comfortable with. Instead he gave me options and allowed me to choose. If I was able to give them a higher rating, I would! Best advice I can give which helped me a lot with time, do the application online and get in contact with the sales agent(in my opinion Corry Polk hands down) and they can have everything ready by the time you walk in.

554,11-Aug-16,"Just picked up 2016 X5 xDrive today (8/10/2016). Couldn't be any happier with excellent service and awesome deal from Noah and his assistant - Dominic!

Whether it is a BMW or VW or whatever type of car McKenna is associated with they fall well below in customer satisfaction.

McKenna BMW is amazing!
We received first rate service as well as an amazing selection of BMW's.
Our client advisor Robert Tarkhanyan was top notch and gave us personal service.
The general manager Greg made sure we were being taken care of and the finance manager Sean breezed us through the signing process. 
If you are looking for a BMW or need to service yours look no further than McKenna in Norwalk it really was a wonderful experience!",5
559,27-Feb-15,"Please do not give your business to these people. Check out the reviews here, google and Yelp and save yourself the headache. We found a vehicle of theirs listed online and we emailed with them back and forth for an entire day regarding this vehicle. The next morning we called in b/c they quit responding to our emails (ironic?) and we were then told the price was $3k more than the price listed on all three sites we saw it on the day prior. Initially they made us sound like we were crazy but luckily I had a screen shot of the price from the night before to prove it. They eventually admitted it was a listing mistake and REFUSED to honor the price they had it listed at. Then they made it sound like giving us a military discount made up for it (do they not give this to all military members??)  Even with that it still was not close to the original listed price. They told us they would see what they could do and call back, but they never did! We called the next day and were told they just sold it. TERRIBLE BUSINESS ETIQUETTE... If I misquoted a client I would never go back and ask for more, I would honor the price because it was MY ERROR. I understand mistakes happen, however they clearly we're not concerned with making it right or customer satisfaction in general. The reviews all speak for themselves, I should've read them first. ",1
560,03-Sep-14,"After trying so many dealers out looking for an X5 diesel, I found McKenna just as a whim when they said they had some inventory.
I checked it out online, made contact online and most of the negotiations were by email.

I came in to test drive it and found it perfect - Alpine White w/ Cinnamon brown interior.

Loaded with the 20"" SAV package, Premium, and NAV, I was happy.

Even more happy after the sales director: Yi-Wen approved my complicated lease takeover and new lease.  He went to bat for me with BMWFS and got me approved for 2 leases for a period of time!

Definitely recommend you check this great BMW place!

They also have great service - they called and emailed me a month later about a new recall campaign.  ",5
561,12-Apr-14,"All cars fall apart, it's just that BMWs cost more to put back together again. When the service light came up, the fault codes were P0171 System too lean (bank1), P0174 System too lean (bank2), P0411 Secondary air injection error, P0599 Thermostat Out of Range. So the quoted price was about $1000 to repair, which included half parts and half labor. Unable to afford this, $136 was my cost for having an Enterprise rental two days and the diagnostics coming back to replace the thermostat and check valve. The parts for the thermostat was about $60, and the check valve was $110. 

Removing the check valve showed that it was malfunctioning because of too much carbon build up. So.. soak it in degreaser formula, ammonia, and boiling water fixed the issue. Apparently the check valve wouldn't close because it was just clogged with carbon, and this solution cleared it up and replacing the part won't be necessary. Having an air compressor to clean and dry it out is a good idea, including some dry silicone spray to lubricate the internals of the cleaned check valve. 

Replacing the thermostat was necessary because of it's electrical components which weren't registering correctly. 

Now to changing the oil and oil filter, with the transmission oil reaching 75k in miles, it's just a good idea to change out the filter and fluid soon. 

Will take in after all the fluid changes to see that all's fine, because the transmission was also reprogrammed, it I can't verify it chatting with the DME. 

Good luck to you all. 
Total cost for getting the parts and doing it yourself: about  25% of dealer quoted prices. ",3.6

564,22-Nov-13,"I have to say that my experience with Mckenna BMW was probably the worst buying experience ever. Every dealership (including other BMW dealers) I've worked with in the past has been honest and up front, and never had issues. Not McKenna BMW. They are great on the phone and over email, but in person everything changes. They did not honor a written deal when I came in to complete the purchase, and just let me walk right out the door. This dealer lacks integrity and honesty. Think twice about doing business with them, they don‚Äôt honor their own deals. What a complete disappointment across the board.",1
565,30-Oct-13,"Noah is the best car salesman I have ever had the opportunity to do business with. He was very accomodating and got both my wife and I into new vehicles (640i and X6). He did so under some difficult circumstances (negative equity, sub-par credit, minimal money down). He consistently demonstrated his dedication to customer service. My wife and I are both extremely satisfied with our purchases and will continue to do business with Mckenna, solely because of Noah. Also, Dominic, Noah's assistant, excels in the customer service arena.

566,26-Sep-13,"I have bought a CPO BMW 2011 328I back in April 2013 at McKenna BMW in Norwalk, California. Since day one the sales advisor was unable to do a check list with me, a bad start. I had to go back three times and ask the service advisors on how to work my vehicle. Then, not even a month later I went back for the bottom trim on the back windshield that was coming loose. McKenna repaired the trim and not even a week later it came out again. I took it back a second time, repair it again and here we go, not even a week later the trim is loose. Finally, they got it right the third time around. Now, the trim is fix,   lets move on to the brake light inside the car that came loose. The car went back to the dealership for that repair.  Two week later I found a loose plastic in the bottom part of the passenger seat, so here we go again to the dealership, they got it fixed. Not even a month later I noise started to come out from the front of the vehicle every time I exited my drive way. I took it to McKenna three times and finally the foreman Richard was able to identify there was actually a noise from the suspension. McKenna kept the car for more then a weeks without any follow ups with me, I would have to call to know an update and every time I was told they were unable to duplicate the noise. I told the foreman specifically on how to duplicate the noise, and they kept saying we can‚Äôt hear it. I called BMW of North America and a Field Technician came down to the dealership and check the vehicle and I was advice unable to duplicate. Keep in mind all of these problems in less then five months with my car. All McKenna had to say is we cannot do anything about getting you into another car, we are sorry you are having problems; there is nothing we can do for you.  I have been talking  to Alexander Buchta Executive Consumer Care from BMW of North America and all he has to say is keep the car if we can find the noise before your 50k the warranty will fix it, but if not  you are liable for the cost of repairs.",1
567,25-Sep-13,This was the second time I used this dealership. They are great and really work with you to get you the best price. Very professional and friendly service.,5
568,19-Sep-13,"After searching for the vehicle I was looking for and finding it at McKenna BMW, I emailed Noah to get a pricing quote. Within 5 minutes I not only had an email response, but a phone call to answer my questions. Generally speaking when you get a phone call you can't wait to get off the phone with a pushy salesperson, this was not that case with Noah. He was very respectful, courteous, and offered to make my experience with him and McKenna BMW a pleasant and quick experience. I drove over to the dealership and he already had the vehicle ready for me to see and drive. We then proceeding to pricing, it was straight forward and not the ""typical"" car buying experience. Because the vehicle was for my wife, I wanted her to see it the following day, rather than push me to purchase that day, we came up with a solution to make it work. Ultimately, we purchased the vehicle, and I must say, it has been the best car buying experience. I expected nothing less from a BMW dealership, but this was stellar. I was in an out of the dealership and was treating with respect the entire time. A big thank you to Noah and his team for making it smooth and seamless. ",5
569,18-Apr-13,"Long story short... the experience was awesome. I contacted Noah about a 2006 Acura TSX. He emailed me back right away but I was unable to get back to him as quick as I wished but he wasn't pushy at all when trying to get in contact with me. I finally had time to make an appointment so I went to see the car. The internet price was 2000 dollars less than the sticker price and although the car was 7 years old... it looked almost brand new!! It drove very smooth as well. Dominique took me on the test drive and he was super cool and answered all my questions. Highly recommend him. After all my info was taken down, Noah Schmerling came over to talk price. The price was already a good price but I asked him to lower it and he did, I asked for 100 bucks off (which was my price going in), he shook my hand and it was done. No hassling or anything. Hassle free car buying..at it's best! I highly recommend Noah and Dominique. They know how to make buying a car simple and hassle free! ",5

The overall experience was enjoyable and couldn't of gone better. Would highly recommend this dealership to anyone!",5
576,18-Dec-12,"I purchased my 2013 528i from McKenna.  I have never bought a car or been to their dealership previously.  Started by doing background research and figured out the features I wanted and got a sense for a fair price.  My basic decision rule was to pay close to invoice, minus any manufacturer incentives.  The first two dealers I spoke with in South Orange County agreed to this.  The problem was that they did not have the car with the exact specifications I was looking for.  So I did a search of all LA Area BMW dealerships and was instantly impressed with the range, colors, packages and options McKenna had.  On the second page of their web listings, I found exactly what I was looking for: Jet Black exterior with Cinnamon Brown Leather and loaded.  Since this was a very rare combination, I immediately called the dealership and asked for one of their Internet sales staff and was connected with Joshua.  Told him what I wanted.  Told him my price rule and within a couple of minutes he got approvals and we had a deal.  

I arrange to pick up the car next morning after my kid's soccer game.  I arrived at the dealership, which was about 1/2 hour north of where I live, and met with Phillip Nguyen, a second sales team member.  Over the next 45 minutes, we completed paperwork.  Easy.  Efficient.  No haggling.  No one tried to up-sell me anything.  

Phillip was fantastic.  When the paperwork, including financials and insurance verification, was done he spent nearly a full hour with me going through the car's functionalities.  The 528 iDrive system (the brain of the secondary functions) is more like a late model small aircraft console consisting of multiple nested menus and controls.  Without Phillip‚Äôs explanation and testing, I may not have been able to understand and use some of the important features.  

As follow up, Phillip called me twice in 3 days and asked if I had any questions and also reminded me to register with BMW Assist.  We also arranged a follow up demo to answer my final questions like linking in the car with my garage door opener and getting the free XM Satellite contract.  

As a follow up, I sent an email to John Hall, who is the general manager at McKenna.  Told him about my experience and noted how pleased I was with the transaction.  I did come across a minor issue related to extended warrantee and extended servicing, which I am purchasing.  I pointed this out to John and within a half hour there was a note from Danny McKenna (owner) who asked the team to immediately correct the issue.  They did.  

I have to be honest, I love the car.  Love everything about it.  But the reason I am writing this review is because the ownership experienced was so materially enhanced by the remarkable transaction and follow up servicing and attention that I felt obligated to write this review.  Not only am I looking to buy my wife's next car from them (McKenna multiple brands), but in all likelihood, I will drive my car to McKenna for servicing (which thanks to the extended servicing and warrantee I purchased is free for the next 7 years).  Whatever you decide to buy, good luck.  But if my experience was anything close to typical, I strongly recommend you consider this dealership.

It was obvious that the manager was either holding the car for someone else and gave me every excuse in the book so that I could not buy the car.

579,30-May-12,"I came to this dealership on memorial day weekend looking to lease a 2012 X5 35d SUV. This would be my 4th BMW lease. I worked with Walter Chacon. After agreeing on a final price, and indicated that I will be paying all inception fees (first payment, acquisition fee, reg, ttl, etc), they still tried to stuff a bloated  BMWFS acquisition fee ($925 instead of $725) in two places, capitalized cost and inception fee). Also they lied about not able to use currently published lending rate for X5 35d, instead, need to use a higher one because I'm putting down deposit to lower the rate. And of course when I mentioned their ad about $2500 off on memorial day weekend, they said, that's on selected cars only (which are? on a secret list?). 

Long story short, after agreeing on the sale price, they still tries to sneak in ~$1400 margin into the transaction. I could stay there and grind until they stop playing dumb on these childish tricks, but I simply cannot support this level of unethical business practice. Walked away and got a better and straight-up deal on the same car else where. 

Bottom Line: Stay away! Even savvy, experienced customer cannot get a straight deal here.

586,03-May-11,"Back in Nov of 2010 BMW repurchased my Z4M due to some leaking issues. I told myself I wouldn't replace it with anything immediately so I didn't think about buying a car.

Fast forward to Feb of this year I started getting restless, I wanted another toy.

So I decided to give a call to my good ol' buddy Paul Bailey at McKenna BMW. 

I've ordered both of my prevrious BMWs, each time requiring me to go to the dealership, sign paperwork, and haggle price. That doesn't work too well for me since I have a crazy schedule. So Paul made this extremely easy for me by asking me three questions. What do you want? When do you want it? What's your fax number?

Simple, right?

After I gave him my specifications, the waiting began. I need to add that I am a very impatient person. I think I called Paul almost daily asking for status updates and every time I called him he was more than happy to help, how refreshing.

So after a two month wait it finally arrives. The car came in on a Wednesday, rather inconvenient but even that won't keep me from picking her up.

Paul calls me and says, ""Hey, it's here when do you want to come pick it up?"" Of course I reply that I want to pick it up today. What I didn't know that it was his day off. He came in on his day off just to deliver my car, what a guy!!

Easily the best car buying experience I have ever had! If your're buying a BMW go to Paul Bailey at McKenna, he will take care of you!",5

590,20-Dec-10,"I had a pretty frustrating experience visiting this dealer with cash on-hand ready to buy a certified pre-owned 528i.  I test drove a beautiful car that had everything I wanted, including GPS (which is a must for me).   

When I sat in the car, I asked the dealer why I did not see ""Navigation"" on the screen, and he said it's because the DVD is not in.  OK, fine, I drove the car, loved it, and after a little back and forth, I was able to get a decent price.   I have to say though that unlike other dealers I had visited, Adam would not negotiate the price with me, until *after* he got all my information, including social security, income, address, family information.  That already gave me a bad impression of the place, but I wanted the car, so I stuck through it.

I went to sign the paperwork with the finance folks.  I was ready to put down $22K and finance the rest, but apparently, this particular dealership has a policy where they can only accept $5K on credit card, 5K on check, and the rest would have to be a cashier's check.  Banks being closed (it was now 6:00pm on a Saturday), I had no choice but to finance the rest and put down $5K/$5K.    

The finance guy did not give me the time of day, rushing me through the process to get me out the door fast.  I even commented to him that he made me nervous, and he didn't seem to care.  I seemed like just a faceless customer to him, and quick sign these 100 documents, and don't ask me questions (although he did answer any questions I did have).

In any case, the deal was done, I paid up, even though the customer experience wasn't there, or I should say despite of it, I had my new car.  I reminded Adam to put the GPS DVD in 3 times before and after I signed all the paperwork.   I go to get my keys, and Adam tells me the he made a mistake, the car did NOT have a GPS.   The whole day was a waste!!  

I left very disappointed, all because the people working at McKenna try to rush rush rush, and don't give customers the time of day.  

My advice to them, slow down, and take the time to connect with your customers, in an honest, non-cheesy fashion.  The whole time I was making the deal, I was wishing that car was at another dealership, where I had really connected with their sales guy who was very honest.

In any case, thank you dealerrater, I am visiting a 4.9 rated dealer today (Steve Thomas BMW), who already on the phone were amazing, and have the car I want.

Edit: I just bought my car at Steve Thomas BMW, you should read my review of the experience.  That's what a car buying experience should be like!  They even took a check for over 22K no problem at all ( I have a very high credit rating ).",2

So it being under warrranty i took it in and told them about the problem and they said they would take care of it. They did not have a loaner for me (i love BMW driving experince but MBZ will destroy them in customer service) they said i have to give them a 1 1/2 week notice.

After all this i got a call the next afternoon and they told me the seat frame was damaged during the delivery, so they would need to reorder the part (now its going on the second day the car is there) I called today to see how everything was going, and they told me that they got the wrong seat and they need to reorder but it wont be in for alm ost a week.

AHHHHH!!!!!!!!!! I told them to get my car ready and call me next week and have a loaner ready for me. After this problem is fixed i will never use anything to do with MC Kenna.

602,03-Sep-08,"I came in to the dealership in response to an online for a brand new Alpina B7 for $105,000, about $10 below MSRP. While all went well in the beginning (no high pressure sales tactics, sales rep got me 0.9% APR which I didn't even know was available for that model etc.), real horrors began two days after I drove off with the car.

1. I became suspicious the day of the transaction because they would only give me one key, and the car did not have bumper tow caps, manual, or navigation DVD with it. They said that someone had taken the key from the storage room and they could not retrieve it, even though it was still early afternoon.

2. Sure enough, two days later my sales rep calls me to come in because there is ""some new paperwork"" I need to sign, acting very shady and not telling me any details over the phone.

3. It turns out that they overshot my financing amount that I was approved for by a whopping $25,000! I can understand a few extra thousand, but 25? Of course this is speculation and only they know the real truth, but my gut tells me they knew I would have bought that car if I knew I had to shell out $35 up front, which was not my intention. So they let me drive it with $10, knowing that I will love the car enough to come up with the rest when they called.

So they pretended to ""help"" me by giving me some money off on the car, and giving me some more on the trade in. I spoke to Michael Ball who is their main finance people. What Michael failed to tell me is that he conveniently changed my APR from 0.9% to 8.6% and wanted me to ""take this deal right now or it's off the table"". I was so apalled by the way he carried himself that I said I have to think about and will come back later.

When I came back the second time (mind you a week had passed from when I bought the car), THEY BLOCKED OFF THE CAR so I could not leave, and WOULD NOT LET ME DRIVE TO BANK OF AMERICA TO GET A CASHIER'S CHECK FOR THE EXTRA $17,000! They degraded me even further by making me sign a statement of facts that I will not dispute my initial deposit with American Express, as if I am some kind of crook! For Christ's sake I came in with my MOTHER to buy the car!

I now wish I had just given the car back to them; I have a very bad aftertaste in my mouth after this ordeal, I feel taken advantage of and above all very insulted. I am one of those people that have never written a negative review about a product or experience because usually I just let things go. But this shopping nightmare was so degrading that I can't even enjoy my ride.

I am STILL missing parts for the vehicle and I have to keep calling them and hounding them about it. ",2
603,01-Feb-08,"The electronics on my two year old BMW malfunctioned and I brought it to the McKenna BMW where I leased the car.  They said that the drains for the sunroof are clogged and that about a cup of water damaged the electronics.  The repair bill is estimated to be thousand of dollars.  McKenna claimed that BMW NA is not covering the repair under the factory warranty.  Amazing considering there is a factory service bulletin clearly stating my sunroof is defective and that an improved sunroof with better drainage system is available and was introduced to the production to  prevent what happened with my car.  

This dealership has not honored the factory warranty.  I see this as bad faith move to get me to pay retail dollars for the repair. 

Take your business elsewhere.   I could not think less of this company.",1
604,30-Jan-08,"Mckenna does not provide customer service to any person who walks in for service. the mechanics jump into conclusions without accurately diagnosing the problem. this falls on the customer who ends up paying more than what he intended. i've taken my touareg back for the fourth time and they can not resolve the problem. they originally claim it was done by me costing me approximately $3200. i recommend you go to a different dealer.

605,03-Nov-07,"This dealership is the worst dealership I've been to....especially for vehicle service.  Brought my 2006 330i to have regular scheduled service performed plus have TCU (computer module) replaced.  The car was in the shop for over a week, claiming the TCU was on order.  After that run around, got fed up and picked up the car....service incomplete, tools left in my car and access panels still exposed,... and still waiting for the TCU.  Then brought it back to have it finally replaced, only to have my car returned with some body damage.  Both Service writer and MANAGER saw the damage and stated, WE'LL TAKE CARE OF THIS!!!....yeah right!  These people wouldn't even return my call.  These people are untrust-worthty and only want to take your money (or BMW's).  
I ended up going to another dealership, with far superior service and found out McKenna NEVER changed the TCU, only programmed it, and rendered it faulty.  It was experiencing occassional crashes.  So the other dealership actually replaced it...THE RIGHT WAY!  Don't go to this dealership....they need to be shut down.  Search the internet, this place has been under investigation by various agencies.",1.4
606,18-Aug-07,"I cannot begin to tell a future buyer of this dealership.  In a nutshell, PLEASE NOT BUY from McKenna!!!  I was an out-of-state buyer who found a CPO 2006 BMW M3 convertiable on the internet with a good price.  After talking with Ray Jackson and Tony Caruso, we came to a deal.  Mind you, I purchased this car sight unseen and relied on the honestly of the sales team to supply me with all the facts of the car.  Needless to say, never believe any sales persons from McKenna.  I can rant for days however I can assure you that my dealing with McKenna may have saved a few dollars upfront however I spent countless hours of frustration that I would happily paid a larger price for the car from another dealer who practices in better and honest sales.  Should you decide to deal and buy from McKenna, please get everything in writing and keep track of all communications with any and all persons.  This will give you the trump card if anything come to head.   Best of luck (you'll need it)!!!

607,18-Aug-07,"I had my independent BMW mechanic inspect the 2004 330i CPO car I chose before I made an offer.  He found a number of things wrong.  I gave my friendly salesperson a list of the items to be fixed, along with an offer.  We agreed upon a price based upon their willingness to fix the items.  A due bill was made listing the items to be repaired.  This included repairing a bent left front wheel and providing a spare key, among other things.

They kept the car for a few days after I bought it to fix the agreed upon items.  About half were fixed, the other half ignored.  The spare key, promised to be Fedexed to me a few days after purchase never appeared.  Turns out my salesperson forgot to order it.  After driving on the fwy, I discovered the bent wheel was not repaired.  I spent the next 4 weeks hounding my salesperson to follow up per our agreement.  I asked her to provide me with a key to the wheel locks, feeling very uncomfortable driving without a way to remove the wheel - she didn't understand what wheel locks were, if you can believe that.  I also discovered a missing wheel stud, which again, she did not understand what a 'wheel stud' was.  I finally placed a call to the CPO manager, Anthony, which was not returned.  Ultimately, I went in person and raised my voice in the showroom.  Manager Anthony was summoned and after significant amounts of b.s., finally agreed to give me a loaner at no cost while they replace the bent wheel.  A spare key that they had finally given me was not programmed and did not work in the ignition.

The car was returned to me with a 'new', straight wheel - but it was scratched, dinged, and dirty - obviously pulled from another used car and not cleaned up - it felt like a final ""F-You"" from my friendly salesperson.  The key was programmed to unlock the doors, but still didn't work in the ignition.  I bypassed my sales agent and asked the parts dept for help.  They were great - got the key fixed in no time.  As far as I can see, the parts dept folks are the only reputable people at this pathetic dealership.  Please go elsewhere, no matter how great the price appears to be.",2.4
608,22-May-07,"Made an appointment for 8:00 AM to change a light bulb.  At 12:00 PM David calls to sell me some other unnecessary services for several hundred dollars, and they still have not changed my light bulb. My warranty expired last week, and my car was in for service two months earlier.  Suddenly, they seem to find things to fix that they could have done at the last service appointment.",1.8
609,28-Feb-06,"I must say that I was very sceptical going in over this past weekend because of what other people had written and what other dealers told me about thier bait and switch techniques.  They had a price for an X-3 lease that no one else could touch. I called them, went in and got my X-3 just like the ad said for a lease. Other dealers told me that they would lose about $2400 if they did this deal.  I love my new X-3 and got it for a steal at McKenna. Give it a try.",4.4
610,03-Dec-04,Took 530I in for first oil change and emissions recall. Oscar was great! Called ahead and requested loaner car. Loaner was ready to go when I arrived. Car was returned repaired and clean. Oscar has renewed my faith in the dealer. I would definitely come back for service in the future. It's a shame that the quality of their sales department does not come close to that of their service department.,5
611,02-Aug-04,"The client advisor, Ruth, was very friendly and helpful, and allowed me to test drive a couple of the 2004 BMWs that I was interested in. She was patient and informative.   While I expressed an interest in the purchase of a new 2004 525, I was hesitant to buy the car as a number of reported problems with it have been discussed in a few BMW internet forums.  She assured me that none are existent at this time.  She then referred me to a sales manager who was rude and who persistantly tried to obtain my personal information with the intent of ordering a credit report, although I had already explained to him that I have my own auto loan terms ready.  I had already said ""no"" for dealer assisted financing no matter what their rates were.  The sales manager tried to pressure me to make a buying decision with no regard for my own pricing numbers for the car.  He then started to size me up by asking me what type of car that I drive now and how much a make.  I already told this jerk that I have my own financing arranged, and won't be using their's.  Apparently my idea of a fair price for the car was too low for McKenna to make any money, so he asked me to leave and shop elsewhere.  I have and got great deal.  Alexander BMW and New Century BMW are much better dealers.  Don't come to McKenna BMW if you want unrushed service and a fair price.  This dealer is arrogant and greedy.  I would have bought from the client advisor, but the jerky sales manager made a very poor impression afterward.",1.3
612,19-Jul-04,"Sales Person had great people skills.Sales Manager came by and ran the ""best numbers"" and after looking at the numbers we (wife and I) decided that it was a great deal. (we purchased a X3 2.5 Premium.The only bad part about the experience was the finance person.The finance person was weird -- trying to pressure us to get a special washing services as well as LoJack which we did not want.Besides him, we had a great experience and would recommend other people to try McKenna.",4.5
613,10-Jul-04,"This was originally a pleasant experience. I leased a 530i from Nick. Dealt with one person throughout the entire sales process (a pleasant alternative to haggling with an entire ‚Äúteam‚Äù of sales reps.). All of the numbers were revealed up front (money factor, price, etc.). I had to haggle with the Finance & Insurance guys a bit over add-ons (as I did not want to purchase any additional insurance products), but otherwise, the experience was flawless.Unfortunately, the ""smooth"" deal came back to haunt me a month later. Apparently, the dealer calcualted the payoff on my previous vehicle (2001 Audi A4) incorrectly (which is ridiculous, considering that McKenna is an Audi dealer, and can access the Audi Financial Services system to calculate payoffs on the fly). As a result, they needed around $1000.00 more than they originally planned. When they realized their error, they let the vehicle sit on their lot for a month while they attempted to cover their losses by negotiating a lower payoff with Audi Financial Services (even though my new vehicle had already been financed, and I'd already made the 2nd payment!!). When I finally contacted them about this (after receiving several calls from Audi Financial Service's collectors, who had no record of any payoff), they gave me the run around, claiming that they had indeed paid the vehicle off, and that Audi's records were incorrect. After receiving additional calls from Audi at both my home and work numbers, I lost patience and called one of McKenna's Finance Managers (Robert) to tell him that I was coming down to the dealer. He explained the situation, (i.e that Audi Financial (not Mckenna), had miscalculated the payoff). He then told me that the only way that they'd pay the vehicle off is if I paid the $1000.00 when I arrived. Upon arrival, the amount changed from $1000.00 to around $1350.00. I refused to pay the additional $350.00. Finally, I was able to speak to the General Manager (Greg Conners) who was apologetic and sincere, but not very helpful. I ended up giving them a check for the original amount ($1000.00)....I understand that the customer is responsible for any payoff discrepancies; however, there was no excuse for the previous vehicle sit for a month while they decided what to do (and never contacting me about this). Had I not received the collection calls from Audi, I would have spent the next 7 years getting rid of the adverse credit information caused by the past due account. Again, Greg was apologetic and sincere, but he could have done a lot more to correct this situation (I shouldn't have had to wait a month to get him involved in this).To make matter's worse, I asked them to program the BMW Assist while I waited (they forgot to do this on the day I purchased the vehicle). They claimed that this was a 5 minute process. After 45 minutes of ""playing around"" with the IDRIVE, their service staff could not figure out how to do this.",2.5
614,22-Jun-04,"I went there when BMW was running of their special lease offers.  Salesperson (James, I think was his name) was incredibly rude.    Wanted to run my credit report before giving me a quote.   I told him that my FICO score was at least 750 and he could base his quote on that.  He asked me 3 times if I really have that kind of FICO score, very clearly implying he didn't believe me and still didn't give me a quote.    He saw me when I arrived in my old BMW, and I had to keep telling me I wasn't intending to trade it in.  He still spend 5 minutes of my time coming up with some bogus number for a trade-in.   I kept asking about their money factor and residual value for the car, and he either ignored me, told me they don't matter, or asked me why I need them.  After about half an hour, he finally confessed he didn't have the exact car I was looking for, but he could trade with another dealer.  But I had to agree to buy first.   I had to agree to buy first, but he wouldn't give me a quote, the money factor, or the residual value.    Then he basically told me that I wanted to know those numbers because I was comparison shopping with different dealers (duh), making it sound like it was unethical.   I just got up and left.   I've never met any dealer this rude in my entire life.   And even if he had been polite the entire time, the games they play at this dealership is enough to recommend everyone to stay away.",1
