1,"April 13, 2018",I took my car in for an airbag recall and left with punctures in my seat. They didn’t point out the 2 tares in the passenger seat even though I noticed them as soon as I got my car. Once I brought this issue to their attention I was told to call back tomorrow since my Service Rep Jose left for the day. I called and was told that I would have to wait several days before I could bring my car back. I scheduled a pickup time at 1:00 with Jose once the work was done and Jose was not back from lunch to help me.  The workmanship on the repair was below average. You can tell where the seat was torn. BTW no one ever apologized for the inconvenience of damaging my seat.  Go to Longo instead. ,1.4
2,"March 14, 2018","There was a recall for the dashboard of my Lexus GX 470.
I took the car to Lexus of Cerritos in March of 2017 and they replaced the dashboard. After few months the dashboard started making noise. It got to a point that the noise became very annoying. So I called the dealership and explained the situation. They made an appointment for the next day and even said that I would get a loaner car. Next day when I took the car to Lexus of Cerritos they said in order for them to examine the problem they would have to remove the dashboard and that by itself would cost me $495.
I explained to their service assistant manager, Sonia, that the noise comes from the dashboard that they have installed and I should not pay for them checking their poor workmanship. She talked to the manager and agreed to check the dashboard free of charge. And she said there were no loaner cars so I had to wait 3-4 hours or take an Uber, go back home and come back again. Since I live about 40 miles away, I decided to wait for the car. After about 45 minutes, their technician came and said since each technician is an independent contractor somebody has to pay for the work.  Lexus of Cerritos would not pay them and therefore I would have to pay. Once I said that I would not pay so they can check their work, he agreed to remove the dashboard and check the noise. Ten minutes later he came back and said he doesn't need to remove the dashboard and the noise is not from the dashboard, but the connection between the dashboard and speaker. A total nonsense. When they replaced the old dashboard they would have to disconnect the speaker and reattach it to the new dashboard. So if there was noise coming from the connection, it must have been because they did not connect it well. To make the long story short they refused to take responsibility for the lousy job they did. And I am left with a dashboard that keeps making an annoying noise. I will never, ever goback to Lexus of Cerritos again.",1.0
3,"February 28, 2018","I made my first service appointment for a Saturday and upon arriving was advised I was not on the schedule. No one could explain or cared, just asked if I wanted to reschedule. I did. I made an appointment the coming Tuesday at 7:00 a.m., when making the appointment I advised the representative that I worked a distance from the location and would need a loaner car.  He insured me that would not be a problem. The day before my appointment I contacted the service department to confirm that I would be getting a loaner car.  I was advised that that was not a problem and it was confirmed.  Well on Tuesday EARLY morning I get there and after waiting, the representative began taking my info., as if I were a new customer.  I explained my info in already input int the computer. Went through that then I was advised there may not be a car for me. Walk over to the gentlemen responsible for the loan cars and told in a nonchalant manner, ""no we don't have any cars, just this one (showed some keys) and someone else has this one."" They went on talking pointing fingers as to who took my reservation. They offer no accommodations. Didn't try and figuered something out or find me a car. I told them I needed to get to work and take my grandson to school. So what was the attitude. Not up to the standards of a Lexus dealership. I left and called the service manager, he was just a bad.  Nonchalant attitude and actually stated, ""well what do you want me to do, do you want to make another appointment?"" I told him I thought he should know in order to improve their customer service. I stated it starts at the top and twinkles down and after as far as the attitude of staffs at this location. It was very clear where it started after speaking with the service manager. They have done remodeling at this location, maybe they should invest in improving their customer service beginning with the people in charge and staff. Called the general manager, never returned my call, what does that tell you. This location is just the typical car dealership, doesn't meet Lexus high standards. Old saying, ""Money can't buy you class.""  ",1.0
4,"November 28, 2017","The service at this dealer is very poor. I got my car service for a Dash replacement that lexus corp. was replaceing due to the sticky dash problem. Lexus Corp. held their end of the bargain, but with a slight hickup. The center council also has the stick surface on my Is300. Since the center council  was not brought up by the service advisor. Lexus corp. only approved the Dash and not the complete set. So the service manager at Lexus of Cerritos said that they only was going to due the dash. I got the general manager involved and he just brushed it off and still dealing with this problem. They even damaged my leather seat in the process of installing the dash. I do not recommend this dealer for service or any continued business because they do not have a heart. Simply they give you the run a round.",1.0
5,"October 17, 2017",I took my car in for the airbag recall and it was done so fast. I only had a quarter tank of gas and when I picked up my car it was a full tank. Eugene Chang is the best. ,5.0
6,"September 25, 2017","the knowledgeable information given to us by our salesman Charles Flores was excellent,  His non-confrontational type of approach was gratefully appreciated as well and his low pressure but pro-active approach. 

I have one complaint.  I brought my 200ct in for a flat tire and after the service reps suggestion I met with Charles and bought a new nxt.  While on the test drive the service rep called and said we need a new tire should they put it on.  I assume they meant if we did not buy a new one.  When we were finalizing the purchase of the nx we were told we owed 235.00 for a new tire after almost waking out the sales manager lowered the bill to 135.00.  I still feel the service department cared more about selling a tire then us purchasing a new car.",4.8
7,"September 20, 2017","Had great time purchasinng our Lexus RC350 from Peter Agnew about 2 weeks ago,  When we went to purchase the car we wanted it was gone, but Peter found the car we really wanted at another location and was able to have for us the next day, Our longest wait for an appointment with Peter was no more than 5 min. We had at least 2 other appointment with him, and each time he was there on time.  
Was very impressed with Lexus of Cerritos.  This was 3rd Lexus that we have purchased from Lexus of Cerritos. Recommend them highly.

8,"May 08, 2017","A couple of weeks ago we bought a used car.  Yani was our salesperson.  She was focused on us and completely helpful.  She went with everything we wanted.  (The finance guy was okay.)  I don't feel I can wholeheartedly recommend this dealership because we've only used it once to buy, and never used the service dept.  Also, they gave us only one key to the car and it will cost us big bucks to get another.
Thank you, Yani.",4.0

11,"July 12, 2016","Let me say this, I have been coming to this specific dealer for years. I went to the Tustin dealership when I first bought my car and the service was mediocre. I was just another car to get in and out.
At the Cerritos location, with Dorothy Lunney it has been the exact opposite. She is attentive and gets my car handled. She always makes me feel she is fighting for whatever I am asking for to get looked at or repaired. When she delivers my car, I have no complaints.

Dorothy is a sweet, professional woman that cares about customer service. She will do anything that is in her power to help the client with their requests. As far as I am concerned, she goes above and beyond.  If you can work with Dorothy, you're in great hands!",5.0
12,"May 23, 2016","I bought a car from them, after they got the money, they did not refund what they were suppose to , I paid $80.00 for the paper work; I've waited 3 months no license plates. I think they took the money and went partying. Whatever U do do NOT go here.",1.0
13,"May 04, 2016","the 2006 lexus gs and is were manufactured with defective piston rings.  causing engine failure.  even though lexus is aware of the issue they refuse to stand behind their product.  don't be fooled by their advertising and demeanor Lexus is manufacturing inferior cars that fail.  and when they do fail they will not correct their manufacturing defects.

14,"October 19, 2015",I called the dealer and asked for a cash price on a ct200h no trade no finance no lease all cash I was givin a price and told if I come in the price would go down and to come in so they know I'm for real the sales person I spoke with was amerika she was very nice on the phone and actually prompted me to come in when I got there however the script changed and I had driven almost a hour to get there and was not happy to hear that they wouldn't go down on the price and they basically treated me rude and abrasive like I was there to harm them and hurt them and I was a threat or something? I don't understand why I was treated so badly I was only trying to patronize there business and buy a car?look if your financing and your going to be grateful to whoever can sell you a car and make it happen for you because of credit challenges then I SAY try em? Uknow why not? But if your upscale and you know you can buy a car then don't waste your time with these people they are about as upscale as McDonalds I will also add that I went to Glendale Lexus the next day and was treated very good and they sold me a 2016 not 2015 like cerritos had for 1500 less .do yourself a favor and skip this dealer if you have a choice .god bless,1.0

16,"March 22, 2015","Went in to purchase a 2015 ES350 cash, was told Lexus of Cerritos would do a dealer trade to get the vehicle we wanted.  Lexus of Cerritos said they would have the vehicle at their dealership in the morning of 3/19/15.  We arrived at noon on 3/19/15 to no vehicle.  We expressed our concern and was treated very poorly by Sales Manager Walid Sarak.  Seems like Lexus of Cerritos was back pedaling.  Had they promised something they were unable to deliver?  We received no apology, only this statement from Sales Manager Walid Salak ""you are not satisfied with Cerritos of Lexus maybe we are not for you"" WOW!!  What sales manager would say that??  
Lexus of Cerritos lacks integrity, professionalism and customer service skills!!  Look at their reviews many of them are poor!

17,"February 26, 2015","I lease a CT200 F-sport(msrp $38,889) with this dealership on 2/2/15. When  I got home I reviewed the contract and found out that I was getting ripped-off. I thought I had a great deal but boy was I wrong. Good thing they have this thing called 3-day money back guarantee, where you can return the car for any reason within 3-days and less than 150 miles. The next day went back to the dealership right away and returned the car. Now 3 weeks & 3days  have already passed and they still haven't returned my $1,200 downpayment. I tried contacting their accounting department and couldn't get a hold off them. I guess they don't want to give my $1,200 back. Good thing I put it on my CC. I'm just going to dispute that charge in my CC. This dealership is a SCAM. STAY away from LEXUS of CERRITOS. Jason from Finance is the WORST.
Molly B. replied to me at my YELP review using a template response the one that you just COPY & PASTE. If your going to give me the number of the MANAGER don't give the dealership number give me his DIRECT number if you're really that sincere in resolving the ISSUE.

She really worked hard to make everything go smoothly and I really appreciate the extra time and effort she put in to making me a very satisfied customer!

21,"October 26, 2014","The 1 star is for the Sale Manager of Lexus Cerritos.

Today I stop ty to purchase 2 cars the GX460 and GS350. Mr. Maher (he pronounced: /My hair/) caught us first. He probably having a bad day and mis-communicate with me a lot, but I totally understand that. My friend has been dealing the car with the dealer and he got a deal $34k on the $35.4k price, so it's a $1.4k off. My friend asks me a favor to go and purchase the car from this dealer and helps him drive it back (SF Bay Area) for him since I'm traveling down SoCal. 

When we test drive, Mr.Maher seems not interested in things I say, just keep going on his own with an extremely aggressive tone of voice. But It seems he having a bad day so I'm not mad at him. 

Here the thing, when I come, Maher manager act as he doesn't know about the $34k. My wife, sister and I were sitting in Mr.Maher room, and Mr.Maher told us his manager summon us to his room, which to me is really rude to customer. I ask him that since we 4 all already here, why can't he come? Then Mr. Maher went to see his Manager, came back and said: ""My manager is busy right now"". Wow, busy that quick. Good job!

To me, I know that being a car sale person doesn't require a B.S or B.A but I doubt that someone could be a ""manager"" without one. However, Mr.Manager act as if he doesn't have one. Just a little disappointed but I don't expect much from those people who asking their customers, especially for the ladies, all 3 come to see him. What right such car sale manager has to summon their customers to him? And we even have a referral.",1.6

23,"March 01, 2014","This is our second new car purchase. We were lucky enough to have been able to deal with Patty Takahashi on both occasions. The process was very easy and Patty was very straight forward, knowledgeable and professional. At first, I was not sure which SUV I should go with and Patty gave us great suggestions that allowed us to make a more informed choice. The selection was great and I was able to purchase the RX 350 of my choice which I am soooo happy with. Great vehicle and I am enjoying the ride. Thank you Patty and Lexus Of Cerritos.",5.0
24,"March 01, 2014","My husband and I found a car that they had online, we spoke with Steven the salesperson throughout the day working on a deal that would be good for both parties.  Finally after coming to an agreement, we sent them a check for payment, Russell the Manager sent us over the final numbers & then we were waiting on final word on the title, paperwork, etc.  Well about 3 hours later, Steven calls to say,sorry but in the last hour we sold the car.  Much to my misbelief, I am not understanding how they sold out vehicle when we sent them a check.  Their response was they had a customer come in and had them a check.  Mind you that we've already sent them a check.  I spoke to Russell the manager and he basically said of well, we have other cars.  Piss poor attitude.  Very unprofessional.  After this incident, I proceeded to read reviews from Yelp and low and behold over 50% of them a very negative.  So much for trusting people to do the right thing.  

In the past we have purchased vehicles from out of state, with no issues but I that goes to show you, you can't.  #lesson learned",1.5

26,"November 30, 2013","A couple of weeks ago I bought a car from Lexus of Cerritos.  At the same time I bought some extra protection for the car paint, windshield protection and LoJack installation.  Two weeks after my purchase I showed up to my appointment.  I was greeted and welcomed to the service department very professionally by the service consultant Mr Macario Lara.  He explained all the procedures they would be doing to my car. Mr Lara was amazingly professional and very well manner. He also responded completely to my questions and make my experience very comfortable. This is the type of worker who I would like to have in my own business as a manager to train the rest of the crew on how to treat with the clients at the front end . Mr. Lara knows really well the concept of professionalism and client satisfaction.  My first impression was that I was treating with the main manager or director of the service department. Kudos for Mr Lara, very well done. ",5.0

31,"November 02, 2013","4th time we bought a Lexus here. 
I started my search for the 2014 Lexus GX 460 since September. We wanted to try other dealerships, so we went to Longo Lexus since they are the ""biggest,"" but they didn't have it in stock  and we were told they'll call, there was no follow up whatsoever. So I called last Thursday and was told the car I wanted was already reserved. Ugh. Westminster Lexus was sort of dishonest with us. I called them one Sunday to see if they had any in stock and was told they had 2, we went there, but there was none, it felt like it was a lie to lure us there, I was disappointed. That same Sunday, I called Lexus of Cerritos and talked to Nader, he was sooo helpful and easy to talk to on the phone. He followed up with a phone call telling me when they were expecting a shipment. So we went there last Thursday, but Nader was off, but Patty Takahashi was there and boy was I so amazed by this lady. I even asked my husband if a lady selesperson is ok, I've only been dealing with guys, my husband said ""it's much better."" He was right. Patty was upfront and worked for us to get to the deal that we wanted. I didn't feel pressured to take a deal that I didn't like. Thanks so much Patty! We will never go to other dealership again! ",5.0
32,"November 01, 2013","The experience from the moment I walked int he door was great, they have friendly staff from the front desk to the sales representatives. The purchase of my car at time of negotiating was amazing I felt they offered me the best deals without too much of a hassle. The downside came when it was time for the finance part. What I thought would take me 1 hour to sign documents took over 4 hours which 3 and a half consisted of just waiting since they only had one finance manager on the floor. 

i would strongly recommend people do visit the dealrship as I feel it was just not my lucky day for speedy service and the situation was just isolated to that day, but ask for Rick as your sales person. He turned the situation from Bad to a delight. He explained things to me in a manner that made me feel comfortable. I felt as I made the ecision on my own as he gave me the space I needed to look at my options and did not pressure me to anything I did not want. This by far was my best car purchase experience with a sales person. 

For those in the market of a lexus visit Lexus of Cerritos and make sure you ask for Rick Horth!",4.4
33,"November 01, 2013","We were recommended by a family member to visit Desmond at Lexus of Cerritos.  We were immediately impressed with his eagerness to help and his enthusiasm for stellar customer service.  Both my wife and I looked at each other and said we've never had such a wonderful experience purchasing a car as Desmond has provided.  He was patient and kind and even though it took a little longer than expected (the finance team was understaff during our visit) Desmond did not rush us or appear agitated in any way.  When it came time to deliver the vehicle, Desmond took his time to explain the functions and amenities to a T, making sure we were comfortable with each feature.  It has been the red carpet treatment from beginning to end and we appreciate it so much.",5.0
34,"October 15, 2013","I gave the above rating based on my experience with Patty Takahashi when purchasing my new Lexus from Lexus of Cerritos

Patty was very professional, very knowledgeable and extremely accommodating and most importantly to me…trustworthy. 

She was not only friendly,  but I truly believe she was genuinely concerned about my needs and what was best for me.....not just trying to sell me a car. 

I will highly recommend Patty and Lexus of Cerritos to family, friends, co-workers and anyone else I encounter that may be in the market to purchase a vehicle.

Overall, this was by far the most positive experience I have ever had in regards to purchasing/leasing a vehicle.

37,"September 24, 2013","Having Patty Takahashi as my sales consultant in my very first lease of a new car was truly a TREAT!! Patty is a wonderful person, and made this experience very pleasant. She explored all lengths to help me drive home in a 2013 Lexus Hybrid CT 200h. I scheduled a time to meet - initially, just wanting to look at vehicles - which I and a friend did - many in fact!! Patty was patient and very helpful - sometimes carrying several keys in her hands at once because of all the cars we viewed. In the end, I was driving home in a car I truly wanted. The paperwork was not obtrusive, and the finance department was accommodating. Ask for Patty!! She's honest, and will work to get you the best deal. Thank you Patty!!!

Hello my name is Pamela Drake and I purchased a car from your dealership on 8-6-2013. Allen Johnson was my sales person. He provided great service and was awesome with helping me choose the right vehicle. My experience at Lexus Cerritos was going great until I had to sit down at the finance department with a lady name Katina. She was very aggressive and unpleasant to deal with. She didn't explain much just was pushing the forms in front on my saying sign here, sign here. I felt very uneasy and was very upset and not happy with the way I was treated. At serval times I felt the need to just end the whole deal because of her very rude behavior and very bad customer experience. But because Allen Johnson has done such a tremendous job helping me that day I decide not to cancel. I felt very uneasy and disrespect as a customer. I want Lexus to address these issues with Katina and I would like some extra training for her in the area of customer service experience. I'm sure Lexus of Cerritos has received many complaints with this same issue. Until Lexus of Cerritos handle this serious matter. You will alway lose great customers because of Katina. ",1.0
42,"August 14, 2013","I went into Lexus of Cerritos not to sure if I wanted to get the Lexus CT200h and sure enough I drove away with one thanks to David Castillo who was very friendly and helpful.  Maybe it feel like a comfortable process as well as being realistic about the details.  I am pretty young compared to most people who probably come into Lexus so it was nice for him to not assume that I could not afford one or that I didn't have a excellent Credit rating like I do. Especially since this was my 1st expensive car (at least to me). In my short experience of looking at dealers; I have met plenty of salesmen who assume this from the get go without giving me a chance for there time.  I have read plenty of reviews of Lexus dealers and heard plenty of crazy stories, but luckily I took a chance with Lexus of Cerritos. Hopefully everyone who works there is just as nice.

Also the finance process tends to be the part many people do not look forward to, but Sam Cho made it a breeze by being very personable.  Didn't force any add ons, but he knew how to suggest them and try to close the deal. 

If anyone I know is looking for a Lexus or a used car this is the place I would suggest.

51,"July 21, 2013","When we first arrived, we were immediately greeted by a very nice and friendly car dealer. The whole process was smooth, and I never felt like we were pressured or pushed to by or add things on that we didn't want. The overall experience was great.",4.6
52,"July 18, 2013","Came in to check out a new car.  I had 2 objectives when I came into the dealer, to look for the best deal I could get for my lease thats is close to maturity and to get into a car that had luxury and fuel efficient.  They offered me an option to check out a used but fully loaded slightly used version of the car that I was interested in.  Allan Johnson was pleasant to work with.  Even though I know sales people are in it for themselves to get most out of the sale, I felt like Allan Johnson had my best interest.  He had a casual yet professional attitude throughout the process.  Allan definitely deserves 5 stars, even making good on his promises.

The sales manager at the time was also very friendly.  At the end, he laid it all on the table for me to choose which route I would like to go.  He wasn't pushy.  It was nice to just work directly with the sales manager instead of going back and forth with a sheet of paper.  It was still a long process and I wish they got me food too.  I was hungry.  Rule number one of car buying, don't come on an empty stomach.

I give them a rating of 4 on price because they really didn't budge on the price of the car.  I would have left feeling a little better if had them lower the price of the car even a little.  The price of the car was on par with market prices.  So I don't feel I was getting ripped off.  It would have been nice if they caved in for $500 ish.

I have bought from this dealer in the past.  My parents have bought twice in the past.  Each experience have been good.  Every salesperson we have dealt with have been good.  That would be the reason I came to them again.

54,"July 16, 2013",Went to longo and they could or didn't want to make a deal. Ended up at Cerritos Lexus and a day later drove off with a 2013 GS 350. Allen Johnson was the sales person who was able to make it happen along with the manager and Owner. Didn't have the color I wanted so they went out of their way to find me one and have it delivered to Cerritos. No back a forth games straight up honest and friendly service! Really positive experience and Allen is the man! Thanks everyone!!!! The finance lady was awesome too she made me laugh and I felt at home !,4.8

When a perceived problem with the car is raised she takes then initiative to ensure the problem is investigated and the issue resolved before I leave the dealership.  I can always count on having a posite relationship with Dorothy.,5.0
56,"July 12, 2013","My wife and I bought a 2114 Lexus from Alan Johnson at Lexus of Cerritos.  While we were finalizing the deal, he suggested we get chrome wheels for the vehicle. We took his suggestion and ordered the rims.  Upon seeing the rims on the same model we ordered, we told Alan we wanted to cancel the order because we did not like the look.  Alan, along with Sam, the finance man, told us we could not cancel the order because they were ""special ordered"" from an outside company.  The rims cost $2800 and I believe Alan and Sam wanted the commission and they did not care what we, as the customers, wanted.
Jamie Lee intervened and told us we could cancel the order if we wanted to.  My wife and I went to the General Manager, who canceled the order.
I was very upset with Lexus of Cerritos because of our initial contact with Alan and Sam but because Jamie Lee intervened I can now recommend Lexus of Cerritos to my friends and family.

59,"June 14, 2013","Lexi, Internet sales, did excellent work!  She was my main contact with the dealership.  She spoke to me on the phone initially, provided the e-mail quote, worked with me on the options on the car, walked me through the sale, explained all features of the car and followed up after the sale etc.  Exceptionally professional and efficient! I would certainly consider buying from her in the future and referring friends if I could be assured that Bashir would not be involved.  

Bashir, Sales Director, provided the final detailed (all taxes, delivery, fees - out the door price) quote that I requested from Lexi so that I would have no ""surprises"" when I arrived to purchase. However, his e-mail quote on the car was $500 more than Lexi's.  When I questioned the last second price switch he had no reasonable explanation, only weak excuses like he ""made a mistake"" (Lexi provided the initial quote, not him) and that ""I could not get it cheaper elsewhere"" (actually I had a slightly lower quote from a somewhat more distant Lexus dealer).  That came of like a bait and switch to me. My initial quote from Lexi was in e-mailed less than 24 hours prior; it was in writing, there was no misunderstanding. This really is not what I would expect from a Lexus dealership and is not what I have experienced at similar dealerships such as Infiniti of Cerritos in the past.  Had it not been a Friday I would have made the drive to the other Lexus dealership. From the management point of view it cannot possibly be worth compromising the buyer's satisfaction. 

Other than my very unpleasant experience with Bashir making the last second price switch and then trying to justify it, the experience was very good and Lexi was really exceptional.  I would highly recommend Lexi. ",3.8
60,"June 13, 2013","This is the 8th Lexus we've bought from the dealership over the many years since it was owned by Lew Webb, and now by Autonation.  While nothing can compare with the halcyon days of Lew Webb, Desmond Thompson is the constant which keeps us coming back.  Five of the eight were purchased with Desmond's help, and this one, the sixth through him, was leased.  Leasing was something we'd never, ever considered, because we always thought it meant the lessee couldn't otherwise afford the vehicle.  Desmond helped us understand that leasing was a very viable option for us, as we like to trade our cars often, since we firmly believe in Lexus's commitment to the relentless and passionate pursuit of perfection, and we like to see and use what's new.  Desmond has always helped us get the best deal possible, and over the years we've come to view him as a friend.  We do wish he'd tell us his secret for remaining unchanged in appearance as we continue to age -- what IS his secret?!?!  Seriously, though, there is a reason he's continued to prosper in his position of over 20 years, through good and bad economic times.",5.0

Lexus of Cerritos  

Categories: Car Dealers, Auto Repair
4.0 star rating
6/8/2013
I've bought a lot of cars in my lifetime and usually get pretty anal about the price, going back and forth on the phone with several dealers until I am convinced (as much as possible) that I am getting the best value.  This time I tried Autonation based in Lexus of Cerritos and was quite satisfied overall.
We wanted to buy a new Lexus RX350 with all the bells and whistles for my wife, who is concluding a nearly 17 year relationship with a Toyota Land Cruiser.  By comparison, she has only been with me for 14 years...
Simplicity Bank is one of our banks and we had good experience with them on a house re-fi so we decided to use them for our new car loan.  Simplicity said they have a 'relationship' with Autonation, which I presume means the latter pays the former something for hot leads, and we said 'sure, get them in touch with us...""
David Agamaite was the Autonation rep who called and he was very low key and easy to work with, sort of the anti-car salesman type, which resonated with us.  Contrast that to the Costco program which we built a car on line and received endless calls from dealers requiring we appear in person before getting pricing and, I expect, the plea ""what can I do to keep you from walking out that door today without a car?"".  We are all familiar with the games car salesmen play.  We liked the pricing he provided us based on our specifications, but it took him 2 days to get back to us to say he had 'found' the car we wanted.  He made it sound miraculous but we kinda know how computers function.
So we agreed to do the deal and go to Cerritos on a Saturday to pick up the vehicle.  We were instructed to meet with Amy Bronson who turned out to be a charming woman with great customer service abilities.  My wife is very intense and I am a jokester and Amy handled us both with aplomb.  We saw the car after they completed the dealer prep and it was perfect.
We sat down to finish the paperwork and the inevitable hitch occurred:  Amy thought we were paying full cash for the car and we, of course, had prior bank approval for a 10% down payment!  Somewhere in the handoff from David to Amy the ball was dropped and it could have messed up the whole deal!
Fortunately this wasn't Amy's first rodeo and she quickly concluded that we could take the car after paying the down payment and my wife happily drove off the lot with her new wheels.
Could I have saved a few bucks on this deal?  Probably.  But there is some value to ease of conclusion of such a purchase and avoidance of all of the worst that comes with car salesmen.
Autonation would have gotten a 5/5 rating were it not for the couple of problems cited above.
Overall, a good experience....

She certainly did work for us to find the exact vehicle we wanted at the best possible price.

65,"May 29, 2013","I bought a Lexus from this dealership, and I have bought many cars from other dealerships in Los Angeles and San Francisco before, so I have had a lot of experience in how things work or should work when purchasing a car.  Shopping at this dealership was unquestionably the worst experience of my life in car buying.  For one thing, the salesperson was an arrogant, condescending jerk, acting as if he was superior to me because I am a woman.   Ironically, he kept on telling me that if I gave him an excellent review, he would give me a present, trying to bribe me.  
Also, Cerritos is about one hour and 30 minutes from where I live, and since I drove up there to buy the car, it was agreed that they’d deliver it for me.  I talked to the sales guy on Friday, May 17 to remind him of the delivery, and today, one week later on May 24, he was finally going to deliver it at 1:30 pm.  I called 3 times when it did not arrive and every time, the operator connected me to a voicemail.  And the one time I was able to speak to one of the managers, he said he’d call me back but never did.  Finally, at 3:30 pm, I called and began yelling “Where is my efing car?”  I then found out that it was still sitting in their lot!!!!  And when it got here 3 hours later, the driver said he would send me a voucher for a free oil change to make it up to me.  
That is all fine and dandy, but I will never shop at this dealership again.  Car buying has always been a fun venture for me because I love cars.  This time it was stressful, and exasperating, thanks to the Lexus of Cerritos.

70,"May 22, 2013","I was shopping for a lexus for my parents while I was visiting in Socal.  I have contacted multiple dealers over the internet to get a quote.  I only had 48 hours to deal with buying this car but I also had busy schedule while I was visiting.  I have told every dealer NOT to call me.  Well everyone called me except Sterling.  He understood my busy schedule and only emailed me to contact me.  He also gave me his cell phone number so I could talk to him when I was not busy when he was not in the lexus dealer.  This made my shopping so much easier.  He also offered to deliver the car to my parents home which was 40 mins away.  Oh and the price was right.  So for next car(my mom), we will be just calling Sterling.

71,"May 21, 2013","Wow, what a great experience.  I was greeted by Jin Lee the first time I went to look at the vehicle I wanted to purchase. A couple of weeks later I went to another dealership and was not happy, so I went back to look for Jin.  He was very knowledgeable, patient, courteous, friendly and just totally AWESOME.  He did not hesitate to make me feel special.  Then I had a little problem with my credit report due to a freeze I had put on due to my purse being stolen and that's when I meet Bashir Kabbani (finance).  He worked with me and the problem went away.  Next came Katina Arabatzis in finance, she was very down to earth and made sure I understood all I needed to.  Finally I met Sarah Ventresca in service when I went to have the final touches put on my car (tint, lojack, permaseal).  I was in and out with my loaner vehicle in no time.  Sarah also called and kept me posted on the items being done.  Every step of the way I was informed.  I am surely raving about the whole experience.  Thank you for making my experience an awesome one.",5.0
72,"May 20, 2013","This was a most pleasent experience Allen Johnson greeted me at the door and I was treated like a queen from then on. He understood my problems with my current car and lead me to a great ES 350 he did not try to sell me over my budget and  when I said I was not ready he just said he would be there when I needed him which was the next day I went and bought my new car.

Allen introduced me to all the members of the lexus team and gave me the  card of anyone I might need. It was an altogether pleasant supprice that it all went so smooth.

So far i am very pleased with everything Allen Johnson has done. If you are looking for a 10 in experiences you will be supprised with the 20 you get!!!

However, I could not make a deal with them for different reasons. One for the price which was so high, the other said we need more documents from you since your SSN is so new, or you need a cosigner. However, I provided them with my bankstatements and other documents that showed I can afford this car but they could not financially trust me.

103,"April 10, 2013","I should probably start by saying that I HATE shopping for cars.  I rank it right up there with going to the DMV or having dental work done.  When the check engine light came on in my 2002 IS300 and my mechanic told me it would cost close to $3500 to fix, I decided I should start looking at getting a new car.  My commute to and from work takes me past Lexus of Cerritos, so I decided to stop by and look at cars one night on my way home.  Fortunately when I arrived at the dealership all of the sales people were assisting other customers so I was able to walk around by myself for several minutes.  Lexi had finished her shift and was walking to her car to go home when she noticed me looking around.  She walked over and introduced herself and asked if she could be of assistance.  I told her that I was possibly interested in getting a new Lexus, but that I didn't really know what I wanted.  She asked very intelligent questions, answered all of my questions, and could not have been more pleasant to deal with.  I drove a 2012 IS250 and a 2013 IS350.  While we were on the second test drive I found out that her shift had ended over an hour ago, and made arrangements to meet up with her a couple of days later because I did not want to keep her at work, and I did not want to deal with anyone else.  The next day Lexi e-mailed me to say it was very nice meeting me, and listed several cars that I might be interested in looking at.  I was not able to follow up with Lexi because I had to go out of town for work and spent the next three weeks in China.  Lexi kept in touch with me while I was gone, and wanted me to know that she would help me out with any/all questions that I had.  She even remembered what day I was coming home and texted me to say welcome back on the day I got back.  I spent the next two weeks calling/e-mailing/texting her and probably asked her over 100 questions about cars.  She was completely pleasant and professional the entire time.  Two weeks ago I was offered a job in China and I will be moving there this Summer.  I called Lexi and informed her that I will not be needing a car now and she was completely understanding and friendly about it.  I feel bad for taking up so much of her time and not buying a car from her.  I would recommend Lexi to anyone and everyone who is interested in getting a Lexus.  She is incredibly nice and very knowledgeable about the cars she sells.  Dealing with Lexi honestly made shopping for a new car enjoyable.

I had always bought my cars new and held on to them for 10 years. This was my first pre-owned buying experience and luxury vehicle purchase.  Cleo helped me to select a car without making an sacrifices on the features I wanted and how much I wanted to spend.  I went to other dealerships ( Mercedes and BMW)  before deciding on Lexus. I also compared pricing on carmax. Thank you Cleo for making it a great car buying experience. I am enjoying the ride tremendously!

My overall experience at Lexus of Cerritos was excellent due to Sterling Williams. He was very knowledgeable and made the buying experience  enjoyable. I initially had an appointment with Desmond Thompson. Since I was shopping for a IS 250 for several months he apparently had me saved in his system. Coincidentally, it was time for me to trade in my vehicle and finally get the car I've wanted. 
	I've always learned to be early for an appointment, so I, along with my parents and dog arrived at the dealership about 45 minutes earlier than my scheduled appointment. As I entered the showroom I told the receptionist that I had an appointment with Desmond and that I was a little early. So I waited for him to arrive. My parents and I browsed around and looked at all the available IS 250. I initially wanted the Star-fire pearl but two other cars caught my eye. One was a 2013 and the other 2012, both Tungsten Pearl. After a few minutes my parents and I went back to the lobby to wait for Desmond to arrive.  A kind man came to ask me if I wanted to look at any cars? Which I immediately said yes. So he asked Sterling Williams to take me out to test drive the two vehicles I had my eyes on. While test driving the vehicle, he was teaching me the capabilities of what the car has to offer. I test drove the 2013 first. Then the 2012 and the second I sat in the car 2012. I told Sterling that this was my car.  Since it was the F Sport edition there were minor tweaks in this particular vehicle, which made the look of the car ""Sexy"". I loved it and I had to have it. Desmond finally arrived and by then I was already working with Sterling.  Next step was the dreadful haggling of the price and all the paperwork, credit check etc.
	 I know sometimes it can be a pain in the butt to haggle with the price and payments but I can truly tell you that the process was very smooth and Sterling was very professional and pleasant. We finally agreed to the price. I was one step closer to buying the car I've been wanting. I actually got to meet Desmond Thomspon after I test drove the vehicles and he was very friendly . I would have loved to work with him too. 

I also worked with Marouan Mossadaq in financing. I thought Marouan was very personable and easy to talk to. I always hated the financing part because by then I'm delirious and tired but the financing part also went smooth. My only gripe is that if a customer says no to any warranties, I don't like to be asked several times. My answer will still be no. I guess having experience in sales for many years, I kind of know how the system works in ""selling"" a product. In this case, a service. 

After all the paperwork was done and my car was ready to be taken home. Sterling showed me how to work the navigational system and to set the Bluetooth. The process took a few hours. I have nothing but wonderful comments about my experience with everyone in that dealership. I believe it was the general manager who even congratulated me in my new purchase and told me a little pointer in terms of how to handle the vehicle. I also loved how even my dog was welcomed at the dealership.
I also like that Sterling gave me a call a few days later asking me how I was doing and if the car was treating me well. That was also great customer service. I thank everyone at Lexus of Cerritos for wonderful service. I am truly happy with my new vehicle.

Hello

I went car shopping at Cerritos Lexus last week Friday to look for a new and used vehicle.
I was greeted by Allen Johnson, who made me feel comfortable at the showroom and he showed me around and guided me through the available cars there.
I must say that this was my best car shopping experience ever. The salesman was very informative and he was answering very question of ours patiently.

Nowadays, it commonly seen that car salesmen just don’t do enough good job and their only objective is to get money out of your wallet. But, salesman like Allen Johnson delivers an incredible service and gives a very pleasant experience.
I will be coming to your showroom for the years ahead.

159,"February 22, 2013","Over the past few years we have bought a lot of cars from many different dealers, usually it is an experience that I would rather forget. Working with Mr. Johnson was a different experience, he is not the typical salesperson that all they car about is selling you a car and getting to the next deal. He took his time with us explaining everything and and even gelled well with our personality. You really do have a diamond in the rough working for you.
      I have taken the time to write this because we wont buy a car from someone that we don't like. From the gate I knew that I liked Mr. Johnson because of his easy going demeanor. And I also want to say Mr. Yates was very gentle while closing the deal which is very nice to have when buying a car you usually have the closer come in and mess things up but he was very compassionate with what was going on financially. The entire experience with these two was a joy from beginning to end.         THANK YOU

165,"February 18, 2013","I came to Lexus of Cerritos for a normal 30,000 preventive maintenance service and had the opportunity to chat with Dorothy Lunney, Assistant Service Manager.  I related the following previous experience that I had with the dealership in which I was somewhat disappointed.  

(I had purchased my 2009 Lexus E350 used to compliment my wifes new E350.  The car I purchased was a low mileage car about 17,000 miles and   purchased all the maintenance and extra warranty allowed.  

Approximately a month prior to my current visit, my battery went dead and I had to get an emergency start.  At the time, the service mechanic tested the battery and said it needed to be replaced.

I called Lexus of Cerritos and explained the situation and was disappointed when the explained that the battery was warranted for only 90 days and it was not covered on any other warranty.  Although disappointed, I replaced the battery ($105.00) at my local service shop.)

Mrs Lunney related that the information given by Lexus of Cerritos was incorrect and that the battery was covered under the original warranty.  She then suggested that I call Lexus Regional Customer Service and explain the situation and that they might be able to reimburse me for the battery replacement cost.  She provided the telephone numberand I called Customer Service when I arrived back at home.  

Lexus Regioal Customer Service was very curteous and requested that I supply them with the invoice along with an email explaining the situation.  Within 30 days of providing the invoice and letter of explanaion, I received a Lexus claim reimbursement check in the amount of $105.00.  

I would like to send a Particular Thank you to Mrs. Lunney for her excellent customer service advice and assistance.

167,"February 16, 2013","Cerritos Lexus is the BEST!!!  I purchased my Lexus in 2007 from Cleo Williams and each time I go to Lexus for a service, Mr. Williams always comes and greets me, but what I admire most….is he know my name.  If you want to purchase a Lexus, I recommend Mr. Williams…he is the best.

When you purchase a Lexus from Cerritos Lexus, you truly become part of their family. Last week, I had the pleasure of meeting the General Manager, Patrick Terhaar.  Mr. Terhaar was so personable, walking around the dealership; speaking with customers, shaking hands and making you feel simply comfortable.   He truly sets the tone for a great customer friendly environment and it also shows within his employees.  If you want to experience excellent customer, a friendly dealership, and a great vehicle…..please go to Lexus of Cerritos.

176,"February 06, 2013","I originally went to the Toyota Dealer next door to the Lexus dealer looking for a Toyota Avalon.  They didn't have any 2011 or 2012 and we were about to leave when I told my husband for us to check the Lexus dealer next door to see if by chance someone had traded in an Avalon for a Lexus.  At that time, we didn't think we could afford a Lexus.  Allen Johnson approached us and and was very friendly, approachable and informative.  After seeing a few Lexus and realizing we could afford a Lexus I still wasn't sure between the Avalon and the Lexus.  I felt the Avalon was more spacious inside and mentioned that to him.  I told him I wanted to check with the Toyota Dealer next door to see which car was more spacious inside.  It turned out the Avalon was more spacious but the Lexus had more features which Allen Johnson brought to our attention.  He was very patient, friendly and informative with us as was the manager.  Allen is a great asset for your organization and we will definitely refer others to him.  Thanks again!

180,"February 02, 2013","We bought a 2013 Lexus RX350 last week in the Lexus of Cerritos with Cleo Williams. It was a very pleasant experience which was a surprise to us as we did not expect to drive a car home! We would like to find a new car but not in hurry. My husband had done his research for almost 6 months for searching models, dealers, etc. We read the review on Yelp and decided to go to Lexus of Cerritos and talked to Cleo as he received many positive reviews. 

We thought Cleo Williams was the key who cut a deal for us in 4 hours! I must give Cleo the highest remark as by far he was the first person who was able to do business with my engineering husband who cared tremendously about details and had tons of questions. Cleo was extremely patient for our requests such as test-driving different models, and answering questions. There were engineering questions he could not answer and he brought in his manager to help us.  He was honest,, attended to our questions, yet allowed time for us to sort things out. He had a wonderful personality and straight forward. 

Find Cleo if you would like to buy a car but do not have much time,  especially if your spouse is extremely picky! Thank you Cleo! I am very thankful that my car searching journey has come to an end. I am extremely happy with my new car!

We found Al to be ""genuine"" in our quest and the satisfaction that he was going to do his ""best"" to deliver the ""best"" for us. He was very knowledgeable of the GS350 and pointed out several car features that are best demonstrated in person. His negotiation skills with us as well as his manager proved diligent because after 4 times of back and forth, we were pleased with the end result and that Al delivered as promised! 

As a new Lexus owner,(and Mercedes too) I can honestly say, ""Customer Service"" is Al Alcantara's middle name...His ""people skills"" (not the stereotyped car salesman) is top of the line and we will recommend Lexus of Cerritos and Al to everyone we meet when they see our car for the first time.

I felt so at ease and at home I must say. I immediately recognized Al’s honesty and sincerity.  Al Alcantara did everything possible to make this experience pleasant and positive.
 
I really do appreciate and recognize all he did for me. I know he went above and beyond the call of duty. I am extremely satisfied and would recommend Al Alcantara to anyone that would be reluctant to step into a Lexus Dealership. 
I live a few short convenient miles from the dealership, if you’re far from this location, I would recommend the drive to Lexus of Cerritos. The experience will be worth it.
 
It has been a little over a week since I got my black ES350 and I am super excited. I’ll be back in a few years to get my LS460 and I’ll be looking for Al Alcantara to make the Deal. Thanks again to Al Alcantara and the entire team that helped make this deal possible.

Lastly, he always has consideration for keeping reasonable costs down and only suggesting what he thinks is necessary to keep my car running for a long time without unnecessary spending. Also, in the few times that I have interacted with other staff (courtesy vehicles, cashier, etc.)they have always been very nice and attentive.

251,"December 18, 2012","First time buyer with Lexus of Cerritos---now a customer for life!! The dealership was recommended by a friend in Los Angeles area and after talking with several dealerships in Los Angeles and San Francisco Bay--all rather dissapointing if you could even get a return phone call--decided to check out Lexus of Cerritos. WOW!! I was floored by the selection and the PRICES were negotiable. I called the dealership and was connected to Cleo Williams. What a first class gentleman. Being 6 1/2 hours away and pressed for time to purchase a vehicle for work, Cleo had not only secured my financing but even went the extra mile to have ALL my paperwork ready to go over the phone! I was in and out the door and traveling back to the Bay Area in my new vehicle--the vehicle was STELLAR---ABSOLUTELY SPOTLESS!!! It felt like I was driving off the showroom floor!! The financing gentleman was also a pleasure to work with. Super personable and made me feel like a valued customer! No games,no pressure...100% business. I have gotten nothing but compliments on my new vehicle and am more than happy to tell about my experience at Lexus of Cerritos. I thought it was too good to be true---have NEVER had an enjoyable experience purchasing a vehicle as its stressful and time consuming but certainly not the case here. Will NEVER purchase a vehicle anywhere else in the future!!! I thank Lexus of Cerritos, Cleo Willams(salesman) and Marouan Mossadaq(finance) for a first class experience and a vehicle that is SPECTACULAR!!! FIVE STARS PLUS......!!!

If your thinking about checking out a Lexus, go on down and see Cleo!

We did an early trade-in with our RX350 lease and got a great deal for a new RX350.  Yes, we really do like getting Lexus SUV's, this is our 4th one!

Lexi greeted me and from there on listened to what I was interested in and took me in the right direction. She is very knowledgeable, BELIEVE ME, I HAD QUESTION AFTER QUESTION and she was able to answer each confidently. Generally when purchasing a car you have your guard up because visiting car dealerships are generally not the most comfortable places when speaking to sales people, but my experience with her was different. Definitely a friendly environment and I truly felt that she had my best interest at heart. I would most definitely purchase another car from her!

262,"December 13, 2012","This experience was by far my best experience in car buying. I was so discouraged with my older model car that I decided to purchase a new, pre-owned vehicle. Lexus was my choice and always will be. I drove up and was greeted by a well-dressed, professional and outgoing salesperson by the name of Allen Johnson. Mr. Johnson could sense I was a bit frustrated and possibly intimidated because I was asking him questions while still sitting in the passenger's seat of my friends truck. His welcoming approach to me made me feel at ease and that's when I let my defenses down. He convinced me that if I would trust him enough to get out of the car and allow him to ask me a few questions,I would be driving away with a Lexus that night. I'm thinking to myself, ""Yeah right!"". I was reluctant but hopeful at the same time. I was glad he influenced me in that manner, otherwise, I would have just window/wishful shopped. His vibe and energy allowed me to trust him. We walked and shopped for me the right car til I was satisfied. Sure thing, after several trips to the sales manager/director Bashir Kabbani, and test driving a vehicle, they made me an offer that I could not refuse. That was the absolute best news that I have received in a long time and needed to hear something so positive after losing my mom several months ago. Allen was right!!! I drove off in my pre-owned LEXUS as a happy camper. As the saying is true, it takes a village to raise a child, well it takes a team of fine people to make this happen. I would do injustice to this review if I didn't mention the wonderful person in finance by the name of Katina Arabatzis. She stayed late in order to process the paperwork and all the while she kept me laughing. She had great jokes about our Birthdays being a day apart and some tales that I will never forget. Lexus of Cerritos is not just my dealership....they are my family. Thank you all.",5.0

We then took the car for test drive.  Allen was knowledgeable about the product, answered all of my questions and was pleasant to talk with. He made me feel comfortable throughout the entire process.   He asked what price I was comfortable with and what I wanted for my trade.  We crunched the numbers (really in minutes) and we came up with a price that I was comfortable with.  He took the numbers in and then simply made it happen.  No haggle, no stress, no nonsense - a relief since I had been trying to make my new car decision for a couple of months.   I had test driven 4 other types of cars and been to several dealerships as well as a large auto show. I was confident I was making the right choice in car, it was just a BONUS to have the pleasure of working with Allen Johnson.

332,"October 03, 2012","I brought my Rx-350 in for regularly scheduled maintenance and as always Dorothy Lunney did an exceptional job on making additional service recommendations to help my car stay in top condition.

What made this visit worth raving about was that Dorothy Lunney put me in a Loaner car (an RX-350) to help me have zero transportation down time since I was at a major advertising deadline. I could not be without transportation since I have Major clients who needed to get their advertising orders in so they could achieve their business goals and I drive all over So Cal to service my clients.

While I was working through the deadlines I was victimized by a "" window smash and grab"" auto break in on the loaner car I was given to drive. My laptop, Ipad, day timer and technology accessories were all stolen in the incident which was a major setback.

I bought the loaner car with the smashed window in to Dorothy Lunney and Loaner Coordinator Haidee Villegas the same day. They listened to my story and empathized with my circumstance. Haidee Villegas then moved quickly to get me into another loaner car. Haidee Villegas teamed up with Daniel Lara to get me into another RX-350 that was just brought back from a previous client. I was in a hurry and both Daniel and Haidee had insisted on having the car washed and cleaned before they would let me drive off in it. My day had blown up on me and I had to get to an appointment with a Major Client and The team of Dorothy Lunney, Haidee Villegas and Daniel Lara came through and came through big! That is what compassionate service in the Pursuit of Excellence looks like. To add to all of that Haidee and Daniel are working with my Insurance to get the Auto glass replaced that was smashed.

I want to give a special shout to my people Dorothy Lunney, Haidee Villegas and Daniel Lara at Lexus of Cerritos. You guys rock and you turned a bad situation into a much better one. Thanks again!

If it wasn't a great experience I would have never gone back and recommended my friend. I purchased an IS250 in July because my brother told me about Cleo. Cleo is the most down to earth person you can meet. REAL TALK, REAL SMOOTH, AND LEGIT.  He's provides all the necessary information, had plenty of patients and kept me up to date on what he’s doing. I see Cleo running back and forth, each times he sees me, acknowledges me and let me know. He was able to work with me and cut out a good deal.  Cleo tells it as it is, that’s what I like about him. If it’s something about credit that’s not going through he says it and tells me why.  I didn’t feel once that I was pressured to buying anything. 

In addition, my friend was looking into buying a 2012 IS350 F Sport package. We shop at almost all the dealership in southern California looking for IS350 F Sport.   We did found one that he really liked over at Glendale Lexus.  Experience wasn’t great, offer wasn’t there, and felt pressured.  I told my friend that he has to go to Cerritos Lexus, it’s a must! 

So my brother sit up a date, met up with Cleo, Cleo was busy with another client, but he kept us inform.   Through the entire time he’s helping another client he’s helping us also, and that’s why I was saying Cleo is always moving! But always keeping us updated.  
So we sat down ran some number, and more number and more numbers. Cleo broke it down each time there was an offer given. Cleo was able to work out a deal in getting my friend civic off his hands that he was paying for.  In Addition, Cleo didn’t pressure us, didn’t force a deal, we said we wanted a number we can pay and he was able to work it out. 

We walked out the dealership and my friend was so relieved, and had the biggest smile on his face.  
I walked in and came out happy with my 2012 IS250, and my friend walked in and came out happy with his IS350 F Sport Package.  Definitely more people I know will be doing the same.

DEFINITELY CLEO IS RECOMMENDED!!!

Dorothy Lunney is ""Simply the Best""!

Trust is very important and she has earned my trust over the 11 years that we have been bringing our Lexus SUV's into Lexus of Cerritos for service.  Dorothy is the only one I trust when it comes to my wife going in by herself for any service to be done.  Before meeting Dorothy, I made it a point to take in vehicles myself for any service but with Dorothy I have no worries about my wife going in by herself and being taken advantage of.

Latest visit was for scheduled maintenance and Dorothy, as always, made my wife feel like family and made sure that she understood what service was being done and cost that it would be.  The actual cost ended up being less than the estimate.

If you need service done on your Lexus, I recommend you think about Lexus of Cerritos and making appointment with Dorothy Lunney!

Thankfully, this wasn't the case at all here. I'm so glad Eddy was the first to greet me when I walked into Lexus. He was very understanding and respectful of what I wanted and what I didn't want. For example, I was really clear about not wanting the Navigation System, and he never mentioned it again (hallelujah!), unlike other car dealers who kept giving me a million reasons to get the Navigation when I told them I simply WASN'T interested. Also, I told him I didn't know much about cars (horsepower, # of cylinders, torque RPM, etc.) and he explained EVERYTHING in a way I understood. He was completely knowledgeable and worked with me on the pricing too!! Even after the car was purchased, he was with me every step of the way to make sure I understood every feature of the car.

Aymy was very responsive to giving me a quote, spec sheet, and matched my offer for the most competitive price. Aymy was willing to work around my schedule and even met me on her day off! The actual sales process was seamless and painless - there was no haggling or last-minute bait & switch tactic that some dealerships are known for. She didn't push the extended warranty, unlike some dealers, and was extremely patient in answering all my questions and concerns and took the time to walk me through all the car functions after the paperwork was done.

360,"August 31, 2012","***HIGHLY RECOMMEND***
Mere words can not fully express the gratitude I feel towards Lexus of Cerritos and their staff. I recently leased my first brand new car (CT200h) through Lexus of Cerritos and was astonished by their professionalism and general demeanor. I dealt, individually, with Esther Gutierrez from the Internet Sales Department, and Dorothy Lunney, of the Service Department. These two were beyond helpful with, seemingly, only my best interest at hand. Their knowledge of the Lexus product, as a whole, was far superior to other Lexus dealers I've visited in the past. The fact is, at Lexus of Cerritos, customer service is paramount (which is key with me). The staff is friendly, knowledgable, and honest. Seemingly impossible traits to find in a car dealership nowadays. This alone was enough to ease my ambivalence towards the entire car-buying process, but Dorothy and Esther brought about a new level of confidence with their great attitudes. Im not certain when I'll be purchasing another car, but what I am certain of, is that it will be from Lexus of Cerritos... NO QUESTION!!! ",5.0
361,"August 30, 2012","I purchased my third Lexus from Lexus of Cerritos.  Esther Guttierez was my salesperson.  She is amazing.  Very helpful, no pressure, took me on test drives of numerous cars of my choosing.  I cannot say that I negotiated too much because the 2013 ES 350's had just arrived on the lot that week.  There was another Lexus dealership that was pressing me to buy a 2012 as they wanted to move them off the lot.  But Esther did offer me better deals with add-on's than the other dealership had.  She delivered the car to my home and oversaw every detail.  I would definitely buy my 4th Lexus from Esther!

Dorothy Lunney oversaw the addition of chromed rims to my ES 350.  There were a few snags getting the process done but Dorothy was on top of it every step of the way and made my experience painless.  Whether it was a loaner or replacing a soiled carpet mat, I never had to wait more than 10 minutes.  I would definitely request Dorothy as my service rep.

I have compared Lexus to both BMW and Mercedes and love Lexus for its smooth ride and amenities.  Both Esther and Dorothy are the best!",4.8
362,"August 28, 2012","Hi, I was considering buying my first car, a used 2003 Lexus IS300.  I called a few different dealers regarding having an vehicle inspection done before I purchased it.  When I called Lexus of Cerritos, I spoke to Dorothy Lunney in service.  She was by far the most passionate, knowledgeable and informative person I spoke to. I live a mile away from another Lexus dealer but after talking to my Mom and Stepdad, we felt it would be worth the 20 mile drive to Lexus of Cerritos (because of Dorothy).

We were right, Dorothy went over several things about the car and it's histroy with me and made me feel very comfortible.  If she didn't know something, she would say hang on and let me get that information from someone who is an expert in that area.
She told me it was the best $140.00 I would every spend on my car and she was right.  

Thank you Dorothy and Lexus of Cerritos, I am a first time car buyer, first time Lexus owner and a new life long customer.

363,"August 25, 2012","Five years ago my fiance and I went into Lexus of Cerritos to purchase a car. Our credit was bad and we had very little for a down payment. Fortunately for us we ran into a sales associate by the name of Cleophus Williams (Cleo). He treated us with such respect and dignity and was very helpful in assisting us in purchasing our car. He was always upfront, knowledgeable and most important, HONEST.  Fast forward to 5 years later, we decided to look into possibly purchasing another car. Without hesitation, we went back to Lexus of Cerrtios and asked for Cleo. Amazingly, when Cleo walked up and saw us, he immediately remembered us. We were in a better position financially and our credit was excellent. Cleo treated us with the same level of respect, as when we first walked into the dealership five years prior.  He is always patient, and never rushes you and treats you as if you were VIP. Our entire experience with all of the staff was wonderful. We even met a few new friends, Sam the sales manager and our excellent finance specialist who got us a great percentage rate on our new car. They did everything they could to make sure we were comfortable with our decision. Needless to say, we highly recommend Lexus of Cerritos and our wonderful salesman, Cleo! (BWS)

I love my car but knew it was time for a new one. In my entire search, I test drove 38 cars. My first test drive was with Patty & the Lexus SUV but I truly wanted a hybrid.  The new Lexus SUV 450H was way out of my price range but Patty knew that's what I really wanted.  I left the dealership and continued test driving other cars to see if I could find something in my price range that had the bells and whistles I wanted. For the next 10 months Patty kept in touch with me via calls and emails.  She wanted to see if I purchased a car and was hopeful she would find me a car.  She always assured me that she was keeping an eye out for me.  In desperation, two weeks ago, I almost bought a used Honda CRV but it got sold by the time I could buy it.  That same night, Patty emailed me that she found my car...a slightly used Lexus SUV 450H.  In my exact color!  I cannot believe it!  Patty is truly one of a kind.  I was so happy to purchase the car from her.  She made the deal for me, my husband and I are so pleased.

My last car buying experience (2006 Infiniti M35) left me feeling as if I'd just had a double root canal and so I expected the same but this was different. There was no manipulation, double talk, overselling or game playing and I left feeling good, happy and as though I got a great deal and a fantastic car. 

I had visited 3 other Infiniti dealerships (including the one right next door to Lexus), two Audi dealerships, one Acura, and one other Lexus dealership and left each of them disappointed and frustrated (I even sent a complaint letter to Infiniti corporate).  Esther was great, she was incredibly knowledgeable about the vehicle and Lexus as a whole (unlike every other dealer and/or salesperson I had visited), and did not pressure me. She worked on a great deal but was firm when there was no more left in the deal however she got creative and saved me money anyway. She continues to follow up after the sale as well.

Upon discovery that the navaigation system in my 2007 IS 250 went bad and I was just out of warranty (and after providing a solid alternative for a possible fix that she graciously shared and wasn't under obligation to attempt, which ended up not working), she contacted corporate to garner approval for Lexus to absorb the cost of parts if I paid for labor.

Mr Lee took the time to research my car's history and informed me that the light was under warranty and would cost nothing to replace. Prior to coming to the dealer, I had spoken to another serivce tech who told me the cost of the repair without looking up my cars history. Mr Lee's attention to help me did not stop when my car was returned to me. He was instrumental in assisting me with the return of a headlight bulb, back to your parts department that I had purchase to be used in the repair of my car.

437,"June 06, 2012","Initially, my husband's positive experience with leasing and then purchasing a Lexus SUV through Lexus of Cerritos led me to investigate the 350 sedan there as well. Cleo Williams met me at the showroom door, actually listened to what my requirements were, and then directed me to the best car for my needs.  Our exchange was comfortable, informative and unpressured.  We took the sedan for a test drive at which time Cleo demonstrated the features of the car in a cheerful casual manner.  Since I hadn't purchased a car in 12 years, I took my pleasant experience home along with some literature and a promise to return with my spouse.  When we returned, Cleo again proved his worth--he directed us to a preowned 350 sedan with low mileage, in beautiful condition, light upholstery, everything I wanted and more.

Not to mention he was very friendly and made me extremely comfortable during the whole time I was out to get my 1st car. He discussed all my options, how my payments would look and what were better alternatives to getting the car I wanted. Of course, all consultants do this, but Mr. Alcantara made it seemed like he really cared. He gets in your shoes and analyzes everything until he figures out what is the best option for you. This is what Al Alcantara did for me, and I left there with comfortable payments and my brand new Lexus IS 350 F Sport.I know many people end up having bad experiences with dealers because their associates are heartless and only really care about selling a car. I can personally guarantee you that Al Alcantara is not one of these men. He will make your experience an excellent one, and by the way he is extremely funny. My name is Johnny Rojas and I would personally recommend Al Alcantara to all; new and veteran buyers, whether its a lease or cash, Al will take care of you.

I have been an Lexus owner for 20+ years and when the lease expired on my ES 300 a couple of years ago I decided to try your pre-owned inventory, well things didn’t go as smoothly as I had hoped, needless to say, I was quite frustrated. But I believe that it’s not the problem that causes a customer to no longer patronize a business it’s how the problem is handled. 

Dorothy helped make an otherwise stressful situation pleasant. She went above and beyond to ensure my needs were met, not just on that occasion but with all visits to the service department whether routine or otherwise.

661,"January 28, 2012","After being die hard Toyota owners for over 15 years we bought our first Lexus yesterday. Our salesman Cleo was awesome. We met Cleo last week when we took our first test drive. He was very knowledgable about the Lexus product without any pressure to buy. He gave us his cellphone number and we were able to contact him several days later ( on his day off). Much of the dealing was handled over the phone.

663,"January 26, 2012","I had taken my older Lexus to Lexus of Cerritos for servicing for the last 13 years, so I already had a high opinion of the dealership. I went in to buy the car through my Costco membership, and I thought that perhaps we would be dealt with civilly but without any attempt to make the experience an outstanding one. After all, there is a set price for Costco members and I'm assuming the profit margin on cars sold this was is lower than normal.  However, Mr. Thompson proved me wrong the moment we met.  He not only made the experience exceptional, he exceeded my highest expectations with his knowledge and charm.  From the moment we walked through the sales door to the point where I picked up my new car, his professional bahavior coupled with his courtesy and caring made the experience a dream.  He patiently answered questions, kept us informed as we waited for the delivery of our car and went out of his way to deliver the car in the evening hours.  I can't say enough good things about working with Mr. Thompson!  ",5.0

She greets customers with a smile and her customer service qualities are excellent!!! It is a pleasure coming to Lexus of Cerritos because of employees like her.,5.0
676,"January 18, 2012","As I had mentioned in a previous note, I cannot express the gratitude I feel as a customer of Lexus of Cerritos. And even more germaine to my experience is that I own a business that caters to high end, high caliber people such as doctors. And customer service is paramount to them, but in my personal experience every single person, may they be an attorney or a doctor, or a janitor- every person is a person. We all eat, we all put on pants one leg at a time. And anyone who purchases a Lexus ought to be treated with the same respect the provider would like to be treated. 

Jeannie does exactly what I reference and personifies the term ""customer care"". It's not the ability to get things done that is most impressive of Jeannie; no, it's the fact that she has a very high expectation of herself and her fellow employees. She truly strives to keep every one she comes across as people, and treats them with the same respect and integrity as the richest person in the world. 

I rarely, if ever, comment or provide rave reviews of anyone or place. To be truthful, I had issues with the salesperson for over promising but under delivering.  But that was how I was able to fortunately meet the gracious and understanding person named Jeannie.  Words cannot do her justice as she makes you feel like a Lexus owner, new or used.

I thank you for Jeannie for she makes me feel like a part of the Lexus family. Because of her, unless things change where Jeannie leaves, I will be purchasing all my Lexus' from Cerritos of Lexus.  Thank you for Jeannie once again as she is sincerely worth her weight in gold. 

Finally, as I mentioned in my previous comments about Jeannie, my business sells over $30 million per year in gross sales. So to meet people like Jeannie makes me think that all my constituents ought to mimic her and how she is.

Although I liked the amenities there, the drive is just way too far to have regular maintenance done. Never thought of going to Cerritos Lexus until my friend introduced me to Dorothy Lunney. That was almost 5 years ago and i'm still with her now. She makes me feel right at home, tells me whats wrong with my car, explaining in detail, what i need done, what is necessary and giving me a price to go along with that service. She never tries to force anything on me..AT ALL. She lets you decide what you want and need at the moment without giving you that uncomfortable pressure you get from sales people. Basically, what I'm saying is, she doesn't BS around, tells it like it is, but with that loving and caring demeanor. Since day one she's treated me like her own and has always made it personable by remembering my name. Overall, she makes my experience a memorable one every time i go in for something.

696,"January 07, 2012","My family purchased a new 2012 RX 350 from Lexus of Cerritos. I do not know much about other dealers at this location, but I am writing to thank Desmond Thompson and Evelyn who helped us purchase our car on the last day of 2011. I first went through the ordial of going through Edmond.com to submit a pricing inquiry to the dealers around our area. I heard back from approximately 8 dealerships and spoke with them all.  Evelyn persistenly and pleasantly followed up with emails and phone calls over a period of 4-5 weeks and when we were ready to make the purchase within two days, I contacted her to get a quote on the car we were looking for. 

After several email exchanges, we set up an appointment with Desmond, a fleet manager there. We were given a quote for a car and we were expecting to purchase an Rx 350 w/nav and premium package in a certain color combination. They had already sold the car we were looking to purchase but one was available in the color combination we wanted w/nav, premium package plus the comfort package.

Fear not, the price that we were quoted was closely honored and though we did pay a bit more for the additional package, I know that Desmond went extra steps to help us out in meeting what he had promised.  There was no haggling because I knew that the price was already great and Desmond took extra steps to help us out in financing the car as well. I've bought two cars prior to this one, I've never had such a pleasant experience knowing that I am in a company of a honest bunch who cares about their clients welfare. 

My whole family was blessed getting a new car and I highly recommend Desmond and Evelyn. Props to Lexus of Cerritos!

Recently I had some front end bushings done after the service Tech found some broken bushings.  After returning the free loaner car, Jamie took me back to the service bay and had the Tech show me the parts that were broken.  That gave me confidence that the service people are looking out for all your cars needs.

If something doesn't need changing, Jamie has also told me too.  I've been with Lexus of Cerritos since I've purchased my cars.  Great sales staff, clean waiting room, loaner cars and good reliable service.",4.8

706,"December 22, 2011","SUPERB car buying experience! From Sam Cho, the manager, to the customer service Manager, Ms. Jeanie Williams, to the service department. Everyone made me feel as if I was the only ones purchasing a car that day. No rushing whatsoever. Sam took an incredible amount of time going over all the options/features of the car & spent just as much time explaining the paperwork end of the sale. 

This is my second IS 250. Though I had a minor issue when I left the dealership (a scratch was left in tact), the customer service manager, Jeanie, got in touch with me and insisted she helped correct the situation to the best of my satisfaction. And, when we're talking service, this was luxury at its finest. She called every time there was an update to the car's delivery, loaner, schedule change, and even, well...to say hello! And, mind you she handled my case during a tragic case of stomach flu! She was extraordinarily polite, professional, but offered that sweet nurturing hand to every little concern I had. 

Because of her, I'd even consider driving the 43 miles to have my car serviced at Cerritos, if I could. Jeanie made me feel like I was a part of the 'Lexus' family, and not simply another customer. The IS 250 was returned to me with a full tank of gas, fully detailed, and fully sexed up, like we know them to be. 

If ever you need to purchase a Lexus, this should be your first choice. I chose this dealership over 4 other local ones, because their unsnobbish attitude and simply fabulous, fun, personable style of selling. Lexus should be proud to have such an esteemed and highly respected Customer Service Manager. And, know this - not every dealer will have such a position. Her undivided attention makes it worth the effort to make the trek south of the city. I'll surely be back for my next Lexus.

That, I think, is the best testament I can make of the competence, reliability and courtesy I have experienced at Lexus of Cerritos.

Dorothy Lunney has been my service representative since she arrived at Lexus of Cerritos.  By now I think of her as my friend, as well as an extraordinarily efficient agent for my interests.  Dorothy understands my attachment to my car.  On occasion the cost of repairs for my twenty year old car can be quite high, but I always know that the recommended repair is necessary, and that Dorothy has made sure that the charges are fair.

Dorothy seems able to handle any problem.  Some years ago I was driving a loan car while we waited for necessary parts.  I drove the loan car to USC's Univerity Medical Center to see my doctor because I was feeling unwell.  My doctor promptly consigned me to the hospital, leaving my loan car parked in the Hospital parking garage.  Somehow Dorothy, working with my husband, marshalled drivers and cars to get the loan car out of the parking garage, get my car home to my garage and the loan car back to Lexus of Cerritos.  That isn't just competence, it is grace under pressure.  And that's my friend, Dorothy Lunney.",4.8

I finally made contact with Ms. Richardson at Cerritos. She e-mailed me complete information regarding the exact model I was looking for from their inventory.

I made a quick appointment for that day and was able to complete the purchase in relative short order - getting nearly the exact trade-in I wanted.

Ms. Richardson was very patient and informative but never pushy.  She made me aware of whatever options or services that were available and allowed me to decide which, if any, I wanted.

I was very impressed with how fast I received the car, as it was not on the lot.  Kevin was able to answer all the many questions I asked.  Kevin gave me his cell number in case I had any questions after I purchased my Lexus. Johnny the financier was also most pleasant. I was surprised.  We got down to business quickly and everything was finalized in record time. There was a question about a piece of equipment I thought was on the car, and it was not on the car.  However, Kevin immediately took care of it.   That is good business.  I would definetly recommend Cerritos Lexus to my friends, relatives or anyone.  Thank you so very much.

803,"September 30, 2011","This was my 20th car purchase, and it was the nicest experience by far. I started my search for a Lexus CT200H in March in my home state of Florida. Using the Internet and working with multiple dealers I was unable to find the vehicle in the color and options I wanted. I expanded my search nationwide. The local dealers were helpful,  but were trying hard to get me to accept vehicles with fewer options and different colors. This I was unwilling to do. I finally contacted Auto Nation in Southern California and they put me on touch with Aymy. From our first emails and layer phone calls the experience was totally different than with previous sales persons. Aymy made it clear that she was going to find the car that I wanted and would not stop until she found it. She was very enthusiastic and extremely polite. She communicated on a daily basis and when she located the car exactly as I wanted it she immediately contacted me. She made it very clear what we would have to do to purchase the car over a great distance. We were able to handle all the paperwork and financial arrangements so that when I flew into Los Angeles, all was ready for my signature and a vehicle check out. There were no surprises. Aymy presented options that were available to me on warranties, lost vehicle programs, interior and exterior preservation options and several others. She did so in a very forthright and detailed manner and I never felt that she was really trying to sell me something that I might not have wanted.  Her knowledge of the car was most impressive. Sheafs sure everything was set for us before we left. The vehicle is much smarter than I am and Aymy patiently answered all of my questions. When we left the dealer we were extremely happy. This was the most impressive car buying experience I have ever had. For the next two days we were always callin Aymy for help in understanding our new car. She was on top of every question I had.  I would recommend Aymy to any one interested in a smooth, fast and hassle free buying experience. When the update to the Lexus 200H is available, I will be contacting Aymy. I fully expect that she will contact me first!!  She is the best!!!",5.0

I told Cleo I was just looking and he stated, ok, if you have any questions to be answered please come find him.  Cleo was a no pressure salesman.
Well, I ended up finding him and he answered all my questions and went for a couple of test drives. Cleo was amazingly calm on the test drives and confident that I was able to back up the cars in their parking spaces.

I ended up purchasing a new vehicle later that day. The whole experiecnce was a long and fairly smooth one. The only reason I didn't give it a great experience because it was hot, it got late, I was tired and hungry and after the purchase it was just felt so anti climatic.

I have been meaning to write you this Thank You E-Mail since last Saturday. Forgive my delinquency.

You gave me your card when The ROCK secured our vehicle from you. At that time you encouraged me to call you ANY TIME. It is not unusual for a sales person to say those words, however it is rare for those words to have an authentic application after the sale is complete.

You have been awesome in maintaining the integrity of your word. I have had to call you a couple of times for things I think are really dumb. Each time, you have responded as though my issues were the highest priority on your “To Do List”. Thank you.

Last Saturday when I couldn’t get my arm rest to open because something was stuck inside. I came to your dealership service department and was told it would cost $275.00 resolve. I left feeling even more frustrated because I believed it was something simple. I was bummed that something I did silly would potentially cost me so much. However, I called you. You directed me to Service manager Debbie Cambonga. Poor Debbie. Cars were every where. People were everywhere and she was moving at the speed of light attempting to manage critical matters. The last thing she needed on her plate was some random man, with no appointment, who’s keys are stuck in the arm rest, driving up asking for her, saying Kevin sent me. Poor Debbie. When her undoubtedly frantic eight hours intersected (more like collided) with my frantic moment, she probably wanted to explode. But she simply asked; “can you give me five minutes”. She actually only took about three. I introduced myself and out poured the words (I would have to imagine) every service manager hates “I don’t have an appointment but Kevin told me to ask for you”. She stayed amazingly calm. I explained my issue. She said let me check with one of my techs. I grabbed my laptop, entered the waiting room, expecting a looooooooong wait, opening my laptop while she drove off. I hit the power on my MAC. It normally takes about 26 seconds for it to power up. I was just about to dig into my E-Mails when I heard my name being called. It was Debbie. She stood there with a smile holding a mini cassette from our Ministry camera that had become lodged. AMAZING. Before I could get through two E-Mails, I was packing up to leave!!

I simply want to thank you and Debbie. Especially Debbie. God only knows how many Gregory’s she has to deal with in a day with a smile.

Please share this E-Mail with your General Managers and especially Debbie.

Thank you again Kevin,

845,"August 19, 2011","My experience with Cleo has been excellent.  I am grateful that he has assisted me with such professionalism and care from our initial conversation up until as recently as yesterday.  He answered my questions thoroughly and honestly.  He told me what he was going to do in terms of research and he did it promptly.  In fact, he got back to me with relevant information much sooner than I thought he would be able to. Simply stated, all along this process, Cleo has exceeded expectations.  

I get the sense that Cleo takes his profession very seriously.  Unfortunately, car sales reps are often characterized as pushy and selfish.  Cleo's actions clearly could not be characterized as such.  Yes, he wanted to help me get the car that was right for me and perform his professional obligation which is to sell cars, but it never seemed like he was willing to say anything or do anything just to ""close the deal"". He acted with integrity throughout the process.  For that and so much more I am grateful.  

I am thankful for Cleo’s professionalism, his warm and engaging personality, his attention to detail, his follow through, his accessibility and commitment to excellent customer service.

850,"August 09, 2011","Salesperson Cleo Williams was excellent - answered all questions, gave me all the time I needed and flexible on price. He even called after I had the car a few days to ensure that I had no questions about my new hybrid vehicle and gave me his cell phone number to call him in case I had questions in the future. Entire experience would have been perfect except that once I decided to finance the purchase, I was turned over to the finance person and subjected to high pressure tactics and repeated efforts to get me to purchase additional options like extended maintenance and paint protection. Although I said no several times, he persisted and wasted a lot of my time and almost turned a good car buying experience into an unpleasant one. However, I still rate the overall car buying experience as "" good"" despite this issue and so far I am very happy with my purchase.

858,"August 03, 2011","I had seven Lexus Dealership quotes, with three of them being very good actually. Suddenly, when I was just about to go for the lowest quote the very next morning, I got an offer to beat any other quote from the Cerritos Lexus Internet Sales Director, Mr. Chao. Naturally I was skeptical but it turned out to be well worth it at $538 less out the door then my best other quote for the same color conbination car with the exact same options. The 2011 IS250 was freshly unwrapped from Japan with only 9 factory miles on it. The final sales negotiation was made with Patty Takahashi and there was no sales pressure at all during the whole process. I got to test drive the 2011 IS250 first and at the sales office take all the time I needed using my own financial calculator to determine my own monthly payments and down payment all to my own liking. In the meantime Patty had the car professionally detailed in a well lighted inside car bay for me to carefully examine the new car. It was perfect and I happen to be a bit of a perfectionist and know quite a bit about detailing myself. After the sales contract was signed Patty set up my cell phone to the bluetooth system, just a simple couple of buttons to use on the steering wheel in the 2011 IS250 and so much better then using an ear or headset. She also explained all of the features of the new model, I have owned a Lexus IS250 once before. It was my best new car purchase experience and best deal ever.

Re:  Service appointment request for my IS300

Dear Management team,
On February 24, 2011, I phoned Lexus of Cerritos (877-203-0544) service line and spoke with a rather curt female to request an appointment for my IS300.  This woman asked me if I had ever had my car into Lexus of Cerritos before.  I have not and answered “no”.  Next she asked me for my VIN# in order to create the appointment.  Caught off guard and sitting in my office, I did not have this information.  She ungraciously informed me that in order to make an appointment I would need to have my VIN#.  Surprised I mentioned that “…the previous owner of my car had always serviced it at Lexus dealerships so certainly the car would show up in there system.  Once I brought it in she could check the number.”  Reluctantly she made the appointment  
Circumstances out of my control were such that I was unable to make that appointment.  On March 4, 2011, I once again phoned Lexus of Cerritos and spoke with a male about a new appointment.  A male answered and once again asked me if I had ever had my car into Lexus of Cerritos.  I said “no.” Next he too asked me for my VIN# and I replied similarly saying “I do not have it with me but the car has been there before with the previous owner.”  I was coarsely told that I must have a VIN# in order to make an appointment.  In order to navigate around this man’s customer hindrance I had to explain how another woman at Lexus of Cerritos already made me an appointment last week without the VIN#.  That wasn’t quite good enough and the unpleasant conversation continued to the point where the Lexus of Cerritos employee was speaking over me. I have an appointment for next Friday at 6:30 which I have no intention of keeping now that this all has soaked in.  Please cancel that post haste.  

After being pushed to annoyance with Lexus of Cerritos (without ever stepping foot on the property) I promptly phoned Lexus of Westminster.  Answering the phone was a delightful professional woman very happy to help.  She did not ask for a VIN#.  This is the Lexus service I expected.  In more than 20 years I’ve never once been asked for my VIN# when simply making a service appointment.  Volvo does not ask me for my VIN#, Mercedes, nor did BMW, not even the Saturn dealership I frequented in college request a VIN#.  My assumption now is that these two individuals have either been instructed to prevent appointments without the VIN# or are perhaps lazy and would rather not type in all of the customers details.  
In a down economy to be anything but uncomplicated and pleasant when setting up appointments with new customers is a very confusing customer retention practice.  Personally speaking this experience has prevented Lexus of Cerritos from ever handling my vehicles.  Furthermore I shall not consider any new purchases from Lexus of Cerritos, nor shall I refer to it favorably.  

This letter is not a request for resolution.  As far as I am concerned the situation was resolved by Lexus of Cerritos.  I shall never step foot inside of Lexus of Cerritos under any circumstances.  A copy of this letter has been sent to Lexus corporate and I will also be commenting on the community review website Yelp about my experiences.  Incidentally Yelp already shows 3 out of 5 stars for Lexus of Cerritos; a rather poor score for a company JD Powers routinely rates at the top of Customer Service in the US Market.  Clearly my opinion of Lexus of Cerritos is shared by many.

I am very disappointed because of the lack of customer service that was provided.  The unprofessional attitudes I encountered were unsatisfactory and unlike any other Lexus experience I’ve encountered to date.  In short, I can buy a car from anyone.  Lexus of Cerritos has made it abundantly clear that I now know at the very least, where I won’t be buying a car.  

Yours sincerely

Paul A Kaiser

Called around, finding Lexus of Cerritos, and they matched Lexus of Santa Monica's price with none of their attitude, good communications, and no shenanigans. I did most of the deal remotely over the phone, including agreeing on price, and came in to sign the papers. They facilitated shipping the car out of state for me using their preferred vendor, who also did a great job.

They treated me well, matched the good price on the 2006 IS 250, and didn't rip me off on my trade.  They accepted my numbers right away and I didn't have to do any haggling.  Fastest and easiest car buying experience I have had.  The only problem was the car's check engine kept coming on, and they wouldn't give us the vehicle until it was fixed.  However, there was more of a delay then first thought, so the dealer offered us the option of waiting for the car to be repaired or to take another from their next delivery.  So, we decided to take another one rather than deal with the likely hassle the other car would give us.  Overall, it was a good car buying experience, and I would buy from there again!",4.2

I will never, ever deal with an AUTONATION dealer ever again.  I have subsequently purchased another Lexus through another dealer, and I got a GREAT deal, and was treated with kindness, respect, and dignity...with a great deal, to boot!I completely understand that dealers are there to make money off of you.
