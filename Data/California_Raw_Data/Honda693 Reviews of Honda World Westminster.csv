61,"February 25, 2020","If I could give them a negative zero I would. I recently placed a claim with my insurance company because a big rig broke my rear window. Believing in Honda, I took my car to Honda to have it repaired. I figured, my car is fairly new they should provide me with a new rear window. Well Fernando was assisting me and today I find out I have an off the market used rear window! Not a new one like Fernando mentioned. If I wanted an off the market used rear window, I would've took the vehicle to any collision location my insurance would've sent me! What was the point of trusting this Honda location if Fernando is the most unprofessional person and has no customer skills?! I even asked him if they would change my oil since the vehicle is there already. I would pay all fees the day I pick up the repaired vehicle, but what did Fernando do, NOTHING! What type of service is Honda even providing that's different from other places?! Now I'm stuck with my off brand rear window and having to get an oil change elsewhere. Last thing I need to make you aware is my car doesn't drive the same and they went through my personal belongings in the car.",1.0

Skeptical of his number (like any prudent shopper should be) I checked the prices with three other local dealers and only one of them had the roughly the same quote as (HWW), but HWW had a larger inventory of the 2019 Clarity.

When work got too busy I started servicing up in Los Angeles and found the service was nowhere near the quality and have recently returned to Honda World.  Shawn Lindquist has been there the whole time and he took care of me with efficiency and ease.  I have purchased my vehicles from Martha and Kifah.

The service advisor, Johnny Min, was friendly, professional, and efficient.  He asked if I wanted to do a tire rotation as well, which I declined.  After about 50 minutes, I received a couple of texts stating that my car was ready for pick up.  I didn't see my advisor during the pick up because I was told to simply pick up the car after paying at the cashier's office.  I was told to fill out the survey/questionnaire there as well.  Everything was well, except I didn't have any explanation of the service done.  Only received the paperwork and upon getting into my car, I looked at the paper.  The oil and filter change was performed and also, my right rear tire had had a nail which prompted the tire light to come on.

257,"July 23, 2019","Upon arrival, I was greeted by a cheery salesman named Chester.  He immediately got down to business, asked about what I was looking for, and then took me out on a test drive in a 2019 Honda Fit EX CVT.

I was looking for an Fit EX in manual, but apparently no dealership in California had one in stock.  After realizing that there were none in stock, we started to discuss a Civic.  Chester had some appointments at that time though, so I was introduced to Michael Pham (Internet Sales Manager) who took me out on a test drive in a Civic. 

I realized then that I loved the Fit, and shortly grew more and more attracted to the CVT (I drive in a lot of traffic, so manual isn't the best... Fit)  Regardless, Michael made sure that I got a good deal for sacrificing my preference for manual transmission.

I wish I would have grabbed the finance lady's name as well, because she was very nice, and thorough in providing an explanation of all of my options.  I think her name started with a K, but I'm not quite sure.

I have been in contact with Brittany the entire day about leasing a Honda Clarity Plug-in.
I was assured over and over again that they are able to meet my needs. I was told that this was confirmed with her manager Andy, and to come in.
Towards the end my shift at work, i wanted to confirm once again that this deal is still good, since it was an hour drive, and once again i was told yes.
Needless to say, as soon as i pulled up I already had a negative experience. I was greeted by a salesman at the parking lot, and was told that Andy and Brittany was not there. Attempted to call Brittany, but it went directly their receptionist.
After a few minutes, another salesman came to see us and said that the deal i was given is not possible, and was told to come back the next day. Not entirely sure why i would return to this place after this experience. He went on to give me a quote, which was no where near close to what i was given, so we left.

This is exactly the situation i didn't want to run into, since i was going there from far, so i made sure over and over again. 
I have text messages to prove it if anyone wants to see them.

He made time to explain the features even before the test drive and insisted taking a longer test drive route to fully experience the car's capabilities. 

Best of all, he is very timely with his responses. The car I ultimately chose had not been released yet so he notified me as soon as it was. He gave great advice on pricing and the different trims available with the car, which makes him a 5-star kind of guy. I had visited two other dealerships and I can assure you that you're better off coming straight here. 

Honda World is still my go-to dealership when it comes to service and accessories after the buying process. I can't stress enough how easy he makes things for a person who is very unfamiliar with cars. I couldn't be more comfortable trusting my car with Joselito and his service team.

430,"September 22, 2018","I have had my sights on a new car after my 1999 Honda Accord which as handed-down to me for nearly 19 years started giving me more trouble than it was worth. The Honda brand was what I started off on and through the years I have come to appreciate it's reliability and performance. It then came to no surprise that my very first vehicle purchase I made with my own money was a Honda as well in (A  2006 Honda CBR RR 600 motorcycle). 

I was recommended by my family to visit Honda World OC since my old Accord was originally purchased there. I could not be more pleased with my purchase of a new 2018 Honda Civic EX. My salesman, Michael Pham was helpful in the demonstration and explanation of my vehicle's functions. He also made a great connection with my mom and dad who was there through discussing his time in Vietnam and the labors of love parents endure for a chance to see their children succeed which brought peace of mind to my parents.

He asked me to come over to do the paperwork. I am glad I called before I went there to check on the color only to realize he was gone for the day. I was then transferred to his son Khaled who said he will check with his dad on the deal and call me back in 5 minutes. It has been almost 24 hours and over 20 calls and still couldn't get either of the guys. One time I got hold of him, he said he sent me text messages and his phone was acting weird and he again said he is in a meeting and will call me in 5 minutes and hung up.

I tried to talk to a Supervisor about this and no luck. Just more of the same treatment. If they treat potential buyers like this, imagine once you are there at their dealership. I am sure they are used to humiliating and intimidating people and forcing them to buy vehicles at high prices. I hope Honda does something to shut these guys down. My sincere appeal to anyone reading this is to avoid these guys. You deserve better. All their prices over the phone are just to get you to the dealership. They will not honor deals and they will try all kinds of tactics to make you pay more. Stay away.

547,"September 02, 2017","This dealership is Unethical, Deceitful, & Dishonest!

I found a used Honda Accord on Autolist located at Honda World in Westminster. I called the dealership and spoke with Chris (salesperson) to make sure the car was still available. I also inquired about the price because under the price of the car it said to ""make an offers."" Chris asked for my number and said he'd call me back. 

Chris text me back and we agreed on the price via text (see attached). I clearly told Chris please do not waste our time. I clearly clarified and confirmed the price more than once via text. I was pretty confident as I had everything in writing on what was supposed to transpire once we arrived at the dealership. We drove over thirty miles on a late Friday night (last night to be exact) with high expectations on purchasing this vehicle. We finally arrive only to be told Chris had an unexpected emergency and had to leave. umm, okay! Jimmy, a salesperson approached us and said he could help us. We proceeded to test drive the car and when we returned back to the dealership we began showing Jimmy the text from Chris and he abruptly told us there was no way he could sell us the car at the price Chris and I agreed on. We were stunned!

Per the text from Chris he told us to speak with Armin, if he (Chris) wasn't around.  We then asked to speak to Armin. Jimmy goes to get him but he's apparently with clients. We agreed to wait. After thirty-minutes of waiting Jimmy informs us that Armin said, ""there's nothing he could do.""

At this point we are beyond furious and demanded to speak with Armin. Armin finally comes out to speak with us and he seemed extremely agitated as if it were our fault that Chris had blatantly lied and used bait and switch to get us to come to the dealership. Armin began to deny the fact that Chris had given us the price of the vehicle until we showed him the text. He quickly changed his tune and offered us a gas card as if this would seal the deal... NO WAY! This is just the beginning. I will post on every social media that'll let me post to let potential buyers know that this dealership is full of scammers. I will also seek whatever recourse I can from this UNETHICAL, DECEITFUL, DISHONEST DEALERSHIP! 

Honda World-One of OC's finest Scammers!

She without question hands him her car key and he walks away, comes back 20 minutes later telling her they are taking the car back because they couldn't finance her.

I talked to the employee in service department over the phone and he promised me the dealer would replace both front and rear brake pads for $99.95 each.   I showed up Saturday morning around 10:00 am and the service employee ""Abraham Heredia"" wrote up a quote for a total of $199.95 which was fine.  This confirmed the price quote I received over the phone...

Guess what?????  By the time the service was done, I received a STICKER SHOCK!!!!!!  What was $199.95 came out to be $366+; Almost twice as much as the promised price.  Over the phone, they promised me $199.95 and in person, the pre-service quote was confirmed $199.95 for the Acura MDX.  By the time the service was done, they told me Acura parts were more expensive. Therefore, they had to increase the price.  Why didn't he tell me that upfront?  Why didn't he check with me to see if I was OK with the pricing before the service was done?

We had to return on 2/16/15 to resign a new contract because the bank would not finance our Warranty Solutions the extended warranty . So it actually worked out for us because it lowered our monthly payment which made us happy . But you know how it is when the finance manager say's sign here initial here and my interest was really only on what our interest rate and monthly payment would be . Well when we got home and after we ate dinner I started to look over our contract and I noticed on Line H of the sales contract we were being charged $750 for Surface Protection ""Invisiguard "" which I never asked for this to be put on our vehicle and our finance manager Duylinh Huynh never mentioned it to us at the time we signed the contract . Also in reviewing the contract every add on we did agree on for some reason all cost $750 my alarm upgrade , Honda Care Sentinel , and Gap Insurance all cost $750 .
The next day I called to speak to our finance manager I was told by Michelle who I guess is the operator receptionist that he was busy . So I sent him a text message ,. The following day on 2/18 /15 Mr. Duylinh returned my call and I questioned him about the Invisiguard and he said that all new vehicles at Honda World get this added on . I asked him why he didn't mention or disclose this and he merely said that he was sorry and he forgot and then he offered a free car wash next time we were around the dealership . He then said check your doors and you'll notice the Invisiguard and I said ok I'll check . Well I checked and I could not detect any Invisiguard . So at this point I decided to wait to cool down because we did initial Line H . About a week went by and customer service relations manager Thelma called to ask about our experience at Honda World and I vented my frustration about being scammed . She said she would talk to Duylinh about it and get back to me . Hours went by and she called back and she said she spoke with Duylinh and he told her the protectant has been applied so I told her that our salesman Tam Le told us that this vehicle had just arrived on the morning we purchased the car and in fact he had to go get the car from their storage facility and when it was brought over to the new car area it still had most of the white paper you see on cars when it's on the transportation truck . So I asked how and when this was installed , which I got the reply of I can have Duylinh call you about it and I told no thanks . But I did tell that I was going to have the vehicle looked at by some Auto Body Shops to see if they could see the Invisiguard on our new car . I took our vehicle to 4 different body shops and not one of them could detect any Invisiguard and when I mentioned I was charged $750 to one estimator that is ridiculous and they ripped me off big time . I am seriously thinking of filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau  ,.Don't know if will help since we did initial but not receiving it makes me furious . 
So buyers beware of this hidden charge and read every part of the contract you initial .

WORST CAR DEALERSHIP ON THE PLANET!!!
I don't even want to give them 1 star!
It's the old bait and switch. 
We had been looking for a Honda and found one on there website and called and they said they would beat the other place that had the same car we were looking at. Sean was the guy I spoke to on the phone. I told him we were coming from San Diego and would be there around 6 pm. He said no problem. Traffic was horrible and we didn't get there until almost 7 pm, but before we arrived I called them as we were getting off at Buena Park Blvd. and spoke with Sean again asking him if they still had the car and he said yes. (Now let me tell you the distance from the exit to the dealership is only about 2 miles.) Upon arrival we go inside and a manager comes over to us and tells us he has good news and bad news. (We already knew the bad news before he told us.) 
The bad news was the car was sold and supposedly Chris did not have this info. (BUNCH OF LIES!). The good news was (in his opinion)  they had other cars we could look at (DUH) and they would honor the price and accessories told to us. (ANOTHER BUNCH OF LIES!)

The first DIRTY LYING SALESMAN was a complete ***HOLE. He was RUDE and DISGUSTING!. I went to the manager and told him his salesman was rude and I don't want to work with him. 
The new salesman was nice and naive. He was new and hadn't learned all the BULL**** yet. 

After hours of looking at cars. They did not have another Honda that we liked. When they brought over an Acura we were interested. And then the haggling and lies began again. They did not honor there word to meet the price and accessories we wanted. Understand we knew this was a better car and were willing to come up in price but not get ripped off. As we were about to leave the manger said if we took the Acura we  he would give us 3 years free oil change, movie tickets, detail both of our cars and fill our gas tanks. 
At this point it is now after 10 pm and we are tired and exhausted with dealing with them. We quickly researched the Acura to see what a fair price was.
We told them the price we wanted and after some more haggling we finally agreed upon the price. 

Now the finance nightmare/experience. We asked for the 1.9% interest rate and was told by the manager that only people with good credit get that and we said we have good credit and the stupid manger proceeded to tell us ""that a lot of people say that but when we run there credit they don't have good credit."" Well, long story short we have good credit and got the 1.9. 

In the end we got a nice car but not without a nightmare experience! Did not get the tech package we were promised either.

676,"January 27, 2014","DISHONEST. UNETHICAL. TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE.

I've been looking for an Accord, and when I found it listed on their website, I was very excited! I online-chatted with them on Saturday, and the salesperson confirmed that it was in stock and available. He suggested that I call to confirm a time to visit. I did- though was unsuccessful in reaching a live person (twice). No problem, I didn't have time to drive down on Saturday.

On sunday, I again online-chatted, and again the salesperson confirmed that it was available. I then called and dealership and asked to speak with someone in sales. I was forwarded to Andy (who I later found out is the manager). I asked him about the specific car that I was interested in - he said ""Yes! You're in luck! We have it here! We actually have that model you are looking for in two colors - silver and white!"". Great, I said. I'm looking for white. Can you hold it for me? I don't want to drive all the way there and not have it be available. He asked how long it would be - I thought, maybe 30-40 minutes, maybe an hour, depending on traffic. ""No problem! Come on down. Ask for me.""

So, we got in the car and headed down. It took about an hour. 

Upon arrival, I asked for Andy, and was told to wait a moment, and that someone else could help me. A salesperson named Sky came over. I asked about the car. ""Ummm, we don't have any of those in stock."" WHAAAAAT??? I explained that their website had several listed, in addition to the more pertinent piece of information that I got off the phone with Andy about an hour ago, and he said to come in and test drive it. Well, he went back to see Andy (at this time, he said that Andy is the manager). He came back and said, ""well, we have one in black"". Apparently, the white and silver ones don't exist. ""But....... it's not here, it's on the storage lot and you can't see it today."" WHAAAATT???? Though I had an inclination that this was going to happen, I was somewhat speechless. I asked to speak with Andy. ""He's not available."" Apparently, he was in a ""meeting"" that would last ""maybe 30 minutes, maybe longer"". This was on a sunday afternoon at 2pm. And certainly with very few customers on the lot. I asked for his supervisor and was told ""no one else is here"". 

I'm not sure what he thought was going to happen. Did he think that I was going to show up and be fine with not having the car there? Did he think that he was going to sell me a different car (yes, the salesperson tried to offer me a different one)? How did he think that this was going to go down?

I think what is even more indicative of this experience is that this is the MANAGER that I'm talking about. The manager sets the tone for the establishment. If the manager is unethical, then what can I really expect from all the people who work for him?

So...... lesson for the day? Don't waste your time. We spent about 3 hours on this fruitless endeavor.

I had read some of their other reviews, and thought that there might be issues with this dealership. I was hoping that maybe our experience would be different, but certainly the dishonesty of this particular dealership proved itself true.

And not just dishonest, COWARDICE on the part of the MANAGER - ANDY. It's not too many places where a customer cannot speak with the manager, especially in a place where one might be dropping $40k. 

So, customers beware.

When we came back, the salesperson was gone but said someone else called and offered more money the next day ($300 more than we agreed on). He referred us to the manager. We went in and spoke to the manager, David Min and he denied ever agreeing to the price. He said it must've been a mistake on the salesperson to offer that, despite having it written down and in text message (we discussed options via text with the salesperson while we were eating).

Finally, he said if we wanted the car we'd have to pay $27,800 and laughed, ""it's only $100 more"". We walked out, refusing to pay a dime more. We will pay more money somewhere else with people that are honest and treat their customers with the same respect we give. We had great customer service with Reco and he was really apologetic, but clearly, David Min is greedy, a liar and an extortionist who doesn't care at all about the customers.        ",2.8

679,"August 12, 2013","I drive a used car purchased from this dealership. Extensive check on the car was done with all service needs handled and parts found missing replaced. 

Jason in service particularly I generally find takes my car details. He  accommodates all needs on the service paper work as well as shares the knowledge he can. 

Anything on the car has been without problem handled at this service department.

Sales has been very helpful. ",5.0
680,"July 08, 2013","I've driven nothing but Honda's over the past twenty years and I've lived in LA & Orange County for that same amount of time.  I always have my vehicles serviced at the dealership because I want the work done by experts so I know just about all the dealerships around here.  I just had my second service on my Pilot done at Orange County Honda World and this was one of the best experiences I've had at a dealership in a long time.  Everyone was very friendly, the waiting room was nice.  I walked over to Walmart and did some shopping while I waited.  I'm the type of guy who likes to ask alot of questions but Bart Conroy was very patient, helpful and knowledgeable.  Thank you Bart and Honda World!",5.0
681,"June 28, 2013","I purchased a new 2013 Honda Accord from this dealer and couldn't be happier. They gave me an AMAZING deal for my out the door price including tax. I have bad credit and they were able to get me financed through Honda Financial with a reasonable interest rate and small down payment. They are flexible, honest, and quick. I HIGHLY recommend this dealer and the salesman DAVID TRAN irregardless of what other reviews say. I was turned down by other dealers prior to coming here and they made me dreams a reality! Thank you from the bottom of my heart!",5.0
682,"June 08, 2013","We took our Honda vehicle to be serviced in April 2013 after receiving a promotion for a discounted vehicle inspection and oil change. The service writer was efficient and we thought all was well. Today, less than two months and a few hundred miles later, we took our car to our local repair guy to have the brakes checked, and he discovered that the oil was very low. He drained the oil and discovered that there was only 2 quarts in the engine. After more checking he determined that the engine was fine and the only way that the oil could be low was if it had not been changed or if only a couple of quarts were used to change the oil. We now see that Honda World only rate one star in every area. Never go back and hope Honda World Management is reading this because you have a major problem in every department.",1.0
683,"January 17, 2013","This was the worst experience we ever had. The person who is supposed to help was rude and unprofessional. We will never bring any of my vehicles to Honda World again for any service. We were completely displeased with the Non customer service skills this body estimator had. He was wrong and was trying to tell me I was wrong. I had two vehicles worked on and I was overcharged on the one and the other one was done poorly especially for being a honda place and this is a honda vehicle.  The mirror was not painted and the Honda emblem on the back was missing when we brought the car home. Both were my mistake according to them and if he would have reviewed his paper work and looked at the pictures of my vehicle he could see he was in the wrong. The mirror was damaged at the same time and should have been painted as well and the emblem was there when the vehicle came and was gone when it left. The mirror was eventually painted after my car had to be here another 3 days. 
I will never go back to Honda World again. I think Customer service classes are needed especially if you want to get repeat customers. My whole family are Honda owners and we definitely will not be bringing our vehicles to this establishment again. ",1.2
684,"September 06, 2012","NEW CAR BUYERS BEWARE: READ OTHER REVIEWS

There's a reason why HONDA WORLD WESTMINSTER has so many 1 star reviews. My girlfriend fell victim to their hustle. I was lured by their low price. My general message, listen to the warnings and bad reviews of this place! 

My rant/detailed review:

We were shopping Labor Day weekend at 4 dealerships (I'm one of those research hounds always searching for top value). I handle the negotiating because my gf doesn't do well with small print and contracts. We agreed on an all inclusive price with the sales rep Leo out the door inc. taxes in person. Later that day, I confirmed again with Leo on the phone prior to going in and purchasing the vehicle. Everything was good, we had a clear understanding of what ""Out the door"" meant. 

My GF goes back w/ her sister to buy, I wasn't able to go back with them thinking the price was going to be honored. Stupid me for assuming. Wow how quickly things can change...

They 'said' they told her it was the wrong price and presented her with a new price. Her story is that they were still using 'out the door' pricing when presenting her with the new numbers and they kept her there for almost 3 hours! I'm sure they smelled fresh bait after talking to my gf with the numbers. How could their price be 'wrong'  by $1500 when the other 3 dealerships were offering the same ballpark number the same day??? At the end, they ended up throwing on the 'out the door' (inc. taxes) as the purchase price, and added on taxes again. Taking about $1500 of our hard earned money. My gf, again, not good with contracts and numbers, signs away thinking the price was set. Their word is complete BS and they will take advantage if you don't know what you are doing. 

I called and spoke with the manager a few days later after learning about this. Manager was completely unhelpful and borderline rude. Explaining to me that all the numbers were on the contract. His general message ""She signed the contract, too bad"". It was a complete dead end. This dealership does not care and just wants to make the single car sale and move onto the next. I feel she was grossly taken advantage of and I strongly do not agree with this business practice. 

I take fault in this because I did not see this the whole way through, I just hope to bring this to light and help some of you avoid the headache and frustration this dealership put us through. Avoid this one and go to the other local Honda dealerships like in Cerritos or Costa Mesa, even out to Torrance. They are just a quick drive down the fwy. It is worth it to avoid these people!

Our sales rep was Leo Hernandez
Sales manager that was there was Vinh Nguyen

On another note, when I called back, Vinh was not there and Leo was on vacation. I got a manager named Andrew?, who was handling the transaction, saying he 'remembered' that one. Not sure what the name change is about. I told them that I was going to take my experience online to make sure people don't fall into the same hole, the manager Andrew/Vinh's response ""Go do what you have to do"", so here it is and many more to come elsewhere. 

Again: Be careful if you have to deal with HONDA WORLD WESTMINSTER!

686,"March 26, 2012",".  Do not go to this place.  Jimmy and everyone else there are liars.  sadly we fell for their little scam.  After Jimmy ran both my husbands and my credit he came back with only my husbands report  and said that he didnt bring my report because it was close to his.  At the time of signing, they gave me my report and my score was 17 points higher, in the 700s! The deal was already made and the agreement was signed!! They ripped us off.  Im so regretful that we went there. I wish we would of read the reviews before.  Our only hope now is to re fi to try to get a lower payment.  They also charged us for extra stuff. They explained nothing to us.  Jimmy kept telling us how he and his wife are trying to adopt a baby because his wife cant have kids.  Im sure now he was only making it up so we could feel sorry for him.  These people will go at any length to make a buck!",1.2

Bombarded with papers to sign, therefore, didn't see the add-on. Drove home and finally notice the mistake. Contact the dealer, They told here too bad (in exact word) can't do nothing about it. She piss-off want to return the car, they say no.",1.0
688,"April 10, 2011"," They should rename it Honda's Big LIE Event. 

Wanted to get the national advertised lease deal on the civic hybrid. Called Honda World - yes, it's in stock; yes, it meets the specs for the national lease deal; yes, we honor the national lease deal.  Great - I'm on my way. 

Took a quick spin to make sure all was right and agreed to take it with the national lease deal.  Filled out the paperwork, waited, waited...low and behold, now the sales manger has said that they won't honor the national advertised deal.  We had a deal on the phone - that's why I came here - and that's the deal I want. Now comes the Sales Director, Vinh Nguyen.  He says stock is low - we won't honor our word or national advertising.  Next comes Sales Manager - she says we only have one - we won't honor our word or the national deal.

Plus, my wife and our nine month old son have suffered through these wasted hours. 

It's one thing to not want to honor national advertised deals - a bad thing, but you could have told me on the phone instead of wasting my energy, gas, and most important TIME by lying to get me in the door.

Bad, lying, Honda World. 

No car, wasted time.",1.4
689,"January 21, 2009","Disappointing Purchase!
I bought a certified used car from this dealer on November 5th and 2 days later the antifreeze was leaking all over. I brought it in a month later when I had the time since the leak was slow and have been told that there is a crack in the radiator and it needs a new thermometer because the old one is broken. The total‚Ä¶.nearly $800. I thought that they checked and fixed used cars before selling them. I guess these guys have found a nice way around the tough economic times and no longer sell reliable used cars. I just think it is plain old crooked, especially since the mechanic we brought it to after they gave us that total said that the crack is not new‚Ä¶that he believes it has been there for a while and has just been getting bigger. He said that they should have known this problem existed. ",1.0
