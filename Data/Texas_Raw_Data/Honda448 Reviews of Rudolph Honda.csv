0,"June 09, 2020","Purchased a used vehicle a few weeks ago. They told me they offer the 3month/3,000 mile warranty. I still chose to purchase the extended warranty. Less than 1,000 miles and a month the a/c goes out. Take it in and leave it. Call back the following day to get an update, they tell me ""the ac compressor locked up"" causing a belt to snap which broke 3 other things including a problem with the alternator.  The car literally died when I pulled up to the dealership. I understand these things happen. But the issue I had is the service rep tells me they have to wait for the warranty to go through. If I didn't pay the extended warranty I would have to pay out of pocket because their 3month warranty wouldn't cover it. A/C compressors usually lock up from improper fluid levels, improper lubrication or low quality coolant. The day I bought it a manager told me about their warranty saying it's to ensure they didn't sell any clunkers. Seems like something got overlooked. Now I'm stuck waiting for a vehicle I'm paying for (with extended warranty)...to get papers processed that were filled out 3 weeks ago. They were nice enough to give me a loaner but can't leave the city with it and doesn't have 3rd row seating, the reason I bought the vehicle. On top of all these current issues, the day of purchase their was a nail in the sidewall of the tire. Couldnt even take it home until the following day. Bad news from the get go. ",2.0

94,"July 02, 2018","Apparently, change of ownership had not yet been reflected in your records for the vehicle that was recently serviced and is the subject of this review. Although I had printed my name on the service sheet, the service writer did not catch the difference. When I went to the cashier, the name was the name of the original owner, from whom I  purchased the vehicle over a year ago. This review was sent to my email address, but the message was directed to the previous owner. The cashier entered my contact information into the system and my receipt shows my name and address. It is not a major issue - I will simply confirm the name and address the next time I take the vehicle in for service. Otherwise, the service advisor was professional, knowledgeable, informative and very easy to work with. She provided me with upcoming suggested services and the cost for each, but was not insistent the services be taken care of as soon as possible. The experience was above average, and I will continue to take this vehicle to this dealer for service.

While there, they did a safety check and found my brakes were needing some service and were able to knock that out as well.",5.0
110,"June 16, 2018","I've taken a Toyota vehicle for service far east and my experience everytime was: show up on time and receptionist gets your info to later have your car sit in a parking lot until its turn came around. The total opposite  happened at Rudolph Honfa. Making the appointment online was a breeze and they were able to see me a couple of hours later. I showed up, went to the service receptioist and let her know why I was there and who I was there to see and she put me on hold. Not a problem. 5 minutes later, Ivan comes up to me and asks me if I have been helped, so I repeat the same little speech and he smiles ans says, "" I'm Ivan"". Seems that I could have been there waiting longer if it wasnt for Ivan seeing me walking around. Minutes later, my car was gone...and not to a parking lot. It was in its own spot in the garage ready for the mechanic. Ivan did mention that it would take a few hours and he offered the dealership's shuttle. I had to talk to the receptionist first though. Here is were it got uncomfortable. The receptionist was on the phone and I waited patiently on the other side of her desk where she could see me. She didnt make any eye contact and when she put the phone down, she told her coworker something and walked away without aknowledging me. I waited for her return and she got some paperwork and proceeded to walk out again so that is when I verbally got her attention to ask about the shuttle. I put my name down on a sign in sheet and she asked me to wait up to 45 minutes. I waited a little over an hour and walked over to the service desk and asked on the shuttles status. Receptionist got on the phone, called the shuttle person and said, "" oh, youve been here?"" Again, I could have been waiting longer if I depended on the receptionist to be on task. I went home, did a few hours of yard work and later got a call from Ivan letting me know that the car was ready. 

Pros. Ivan has great attention to detail and awesome customer service skills. My car was taken in for manufacturer recalls and Ivan took care of me like a valued customer. My car was also given an exterior wash! Bonus!! 

The not so good. The reason I took my car for service was because my wife made me. I refused to get the recalls taken care of due to my previous experience with car mechanics. For example, getting a tire change at PepBoys on North Mesa and drive away with new tires and a new TPMS error that they gave me a month's worth run-around and refused to fix. So my car has worked great for 10 years with proper maintenance at home and didn't want any unexpected surprises. Driving home, I noticed that the airbag pannel does not sit flushed with the rest of the pannel and the steering wheel column pannel is not a nice seal where the 2 pieces meet and I can see the indentations of a flat head screw driver where they pried open the steering wheel pannel. And lastly, the person manning the post that will give a customer their first impression of the whole fort. The receptionist job should really be filled by a customer service oriented person. It doesnt take but a second to aknowledge someone, regardless of how busy a person can be. A little attention to details goes a long...long way.

Overall, I was happy with my experience and would definitely recommend Rudolph Honda. My pro and cons information was not a complaint, simply for informative purposes. Thanks  Ivan for the great experience.",4.0

130,"May 30, 2018","My battery died a few weeks back.  It was still under warranty so the dealership put in a new battery at no charge to me.  A couple of days latter, I received an email from Carlyle Meeks, the Service Manager at Rudolph Honda, following up on my service visit and if I had any concerns..  I told him I have always received great, friendly service from them, but I was concerned as to why I've had to replace my battery so often.  He responded the next day and advised it may be a software update issue.  So he suggested I come back in and have that checked.  I did just that and it turns out my software did need an update.  All was done at no cost to me.  My service technician, Ivan, even stayed after the dealership closed as I was running late picking up my car.  None of this would have happened had it not been for the customer satisfaction follow up by the Service Manager.

Perhaps most useful of all were the explanations and directives provided after we decided to purchase the CR-V.

Rudolph Honda Service Rep Rick told my wife that the car needed front and back brakes so bad, he needed her to sign that paper that states Honda in not responsible for any accidents. 
When my wife arrived at home. I was getting off my car and I heard her back brakes and was concerned with the noise. When we took the car to Honda, it didn't have a noise. My wife told me what Rick had said to her about the brakes needing replacement brakes. I bought the front and back brakes and I swapped them out myself. The brakes were still in good condition and could have waited another 6 months. I also found where the noise was coming from. I found a large rock that could not have been picked up while on the road. I had to pull apart the debris or dust cover that goes around the drum. The rock was removed and when I showed the rock to my wife, we were both disgusted. I strongly believe that the rock was planted inside the debris or dust cover in order for my wife to say "" Go ahead and change the brakes"". I am so disappointed in Rudolph Honda.

408,"July 12, 2014","So back in early June I went to lot with my family and looked at a used accord and test drove window sticker price was $16999 I liked the car so was invited in to negotiate. Well after back and forth price stayed $16999 told me they don't negotiate prices and take it or leave it. Walked out! went off to another dealership unfortunately owned by Rudolph and looked at another accord and was told about the one for $16999 and i told the sales rep I already tried and was sent packing. sales person said ""i can get you a deal that's weird they did that.."" So I went again across town to Rudolph Honda and saw car again and my deal was brought down to $16750, I was are you for real then i get the whole this car is ""certified"" pitch along with 7 year 100000 mile warranty from Honda. So i bent and said ok.  I already had my financing already through my bank and told them give me or fax a purchase order to my bank. Well as I'am in my bank the next business day im waiting and waiting for P.O. to be faxed nothing so I call MIke bustamante twice and never got it in he then tells me ""thats what happens when i finance on my own with my bank"" well as I'am getting other papers ready and still waiting on P.O. to be faxed I find out car is not certified pre-owned as i was told, so i call mike bustamante again he is a ""sales manager"" and he gives me the biggest attitude saying he never said it was certified, I told him I never dealt with him his sales rep and finance guy told me and my wife it was! he told me to bad he is not moving on the price he took that car in as a trade for $16500 and he is not selling under that price. Well as i walk back into the loan officers office in my bank her phone rings and I can here her saying ""uhuh ok"" ill see whats going on.' Well this ""Sales manager"" mike b calls and tells her whats going on with me cause i have been unheard of and I don't answer calls or reply to them and they have been looking for me to see whats going on with this car deal... wow what a conniving liar that snake of a manager is! and how embarrassing it was her telling me that!! Well i was irate and canceled deal well week later same car same vin is on sale for $15999 i would of purchased it at $16000-$16400 if he would of gone down for them lying to me it was ""certified"" only if he would of been a real sales manager!! well that's not even the end a week later i get a call from a poor sales rep (from first time on lot) not knowing what happened telling me if I am still interested in car its now $14949 i was like sorry never dealing and will never buy from a Rudolph dealership!! Well out of curiosity I go on the Rudolph Honda website and sure enough same car is on sale for $14949... what a laugh I got of of that!!! Well i already told my company who buys fleet trucks from  Rudolph Chevrolet to stay away and get bids elsewhere, my boss agreed.. and I am letting everyone know to stay away especially from this dealership!!",1.0

I had a very negative experience attempting to purchase a car through Rudolph Volkswagen in El Paso, TX. 

The salesperson and I agreed to terms for my buying a 2013 GTI. After some negotiation, we agreed to the price of the new car, the value of my trade-in, and the terms of the loan. He ran my credit and then informed me that all the contract paperwork was completed and all I needed to do was come in, sign, and drive away. 

Our understanding was completely clear and the salesman provided me with written confirmation of our deal by email.

When I attempted to close this deal, the salesman said that he had to increase my cost by $3,168! He then confessed that he never intended to give me the deal he offered. It was clear that he was using the positive offer as a way to hook me in.

I complained to the salesman and the General Manager. Neither responded to my complaint.

413,"December 03, 2012","I had been trying to buy a new CRV for a few months. Living in a secluded area, there are no dealerships within 100 miles, so I had been 'shopping' via the internet and phone. I was having trouble trying to get specific information and response from the two other dealerships I was working with, so I called Harry Kraft last Monday. Within a day he had emailed me succinct answers to every question I had, including firm pricing (that was even better than I had gotten from others), and though he didn't have the color I wanted that day, he got it within one more day! He went WAY above the call of duty in picking me up on Saturday so we didn't have to drive two vehicles home 150 miles, spent extra time explaining all the new features of the vehicle -- where do I stop?? Everyone I had contact with at the dealership that day was very friendly and professional, and you can tell they all work together as a team, which is refreshing.  All said and done within a few days, including ordering and installing the 'extras' I wanted, and it was completely painless.  An EXCELLENT experience.",5.0

Next step was Len Crawford the Finance Manager, no problems there either.  Everyone as usual were very pleasant with no hard selling.

Three days after our initial visit, we returned and were very, very fortunate to be helped by Eddie Hernandez.  We test drove a 2012 CRV on Tuesday afternoon and bought it the next day. Eddie was super in his dealings with us.  He was informative and helpful, but most importantly, we never felt pressured.  We were completely confident that everything was above-board.  We are very happy with the price we got on the car.  Mr. Crawford, the finance officer was very pleasant.  He offered information without any ""hard sell""; I was so grateful for his approach to closing out the process.

When my car was finished, I inquired at the service desk.  ""Jessica"" was rude and impertinent when I stated that ""the paperwork is being done"" in a curt and unprofessional manner.  I was at this point in a hurry, and I began to complain about the delay, and she cut me off, stating ""you can talk to your adviser about that.""  This is unacceptable.

I do not appreciate being treated in this manner.  This Honda is the first one I have owned, and up to this point I have been impressed with both the quality of the product and the service.  I am not impressed with the way I was treated by Rudolph Honda.  A long wait for service is regrettable, but being spoken to as I was is wholly unacceptable and reflects poorly on the dealership as a whole.

419,"August 27, 2012","Aug 27 2012, I stopped by Rudolph Honda to explain a problem I had with my 2008 Honda Element. A piece of the body molding under the driver door had come loose and fallen off during a drive to Dallas. I showed the area with the missing body molding to the service department employees. There is no evidence of damage to the car anywhere to include where the body molding goes. The body molding was priced at $217. I asked to speak with the service manager to see if the dealership would cover the cost of the molding since it fell off at no fault of my own.

It was explained to me that the service manager was unavailable and he would call me after his return from lunch to discuss my options. That call never came. I called back later that afternoon and asked again to speak with the service manager. Instead, he had some other employee come to the phone to explain that they would not cover the part because it was cosmetic in nature, but they would cover the cost of the labor to install the part if I purchased it from them. This part would take approximately 1 minute to install. I find this an insult and a slap in the face. I asked why I could not speak to the service manager and was told that he (the service manager) wanted this other employee to give me the information.

I have purchased two Hondas from Rudolph and have always had a positive experience until now. I have owned 6 Hondas dating as far back as 1991. The fact that my loyalty to the brand and this dealership was repaid with such a lack of courtesy is alarming. I am shocked that the service manager wouldn't take the time to speak with me personally, and that my loyalty to Honda and the Rudolph dealership wasn't worth $217 especially considering the missing part was a problem with the vehicle design, not something I did. 

I will be contacting corporate Honda to explain this situation. I feel they should be aware how the particular manager conducts business.",1.0

He seemed to get a bad attitude when I mentioned I just came from Borman Honda in LC. He proceeded to show me the car I was interested in. The whole time he had his cell phone in his hand. He seemed to be texting someone or playing a game. He was clearly more interested in his cell phone than selling me a car. On a test drive while I was driving he made a phone call and spoke in Spanish for most of the drive. I was disappointed as to I could not focus while driving. After the test drive we went inside to discus payment options. As soon as we sat down he immediately tried to shame me for driving to Las Cruses to see a car.

432,"January 06, 2012","On 02 Jan 2012, I had the oil changed on the 1997 Toyota Avalon at Rudolph
Hondo, in El Paso, TX., today is
06 Jan 2012. No multi point inspection were conducted.  To my understanding,
when you get your oil changed this is included in the service.  The 27 point
inspection or the 19 point check is included with that service and
everything is topped off (not gas).  This was not done on 02 Jan 2012 when
my son took the vehicle in to have the oil changed.  On Tuesday there was a
sound coming from the steering of the car that led my son to question that
something was wrong.  I work on Fort Bliss, so one of my co-workers said it
sound like there is no steering wheel fluid in the car.  I was positive that
it wasnt it because the oil was changed on the 02 Jan and they always check all the fluids. Sure enough, the vehicle was checked and there was no power steer fluid.  I purchased some power steer fluid and placed in the car.  I stopped by Pep Boys to make sure I didn't over fill.  When I got home, I called Rudolph Hondo and spoke with
Claudia Ramirez (service receptionist)  I explained my situation.  She
stated she would speak with the individual that worked on the vehicle and he
would give me a call.   I express my concerns about the oil actual being
change now that I know the inspection were not  done.  She stated that she
knows the oil was changed because she watched it be done. My question to her
is: Were you physically standing with him while he changed the oil or did you watch the vehicle be driven into the bay?   It is 12:21 on 06 Jan 2012, I
have not heard from the inspector.  Once I return to work I called and
requested to speak with the manager over the Servicing Department.  A
gentlemen by the name of Tommy came to the phone.  Tommy sounded free spirit
and was laughing why he was speaking with me.  He stated that his guys gets
in a hurry at times and make mistake.  My mistake was minor this time but could have
being worst.  A simple mistake can cause one's life or thousands of dollars
in repair.  That didn't help me or make me feel comfortable at all.  Now in
my mind I am wondering if the gentleman working on my vehicle actually
changed the oil. 
I have purchased three vehicle from Rudolph: Hondo CRV, Hondo Pilot and a
Toyota Avalon.  I live in the North East and drive over the mountain to have
my the vehicle service. This said something about the service I use to
get. I will be second guessing their work from here on out.  
 I am very disappointed in the service that I recently received and I
hope this is not what I or any other customer have to look forward to during
this New Year 2012. Frank Caldera/920 was the service Advisor and the work
