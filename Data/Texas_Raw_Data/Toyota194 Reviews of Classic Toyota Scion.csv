1,"February 24, 2020","After my truck of 10 years broke down, I was not looking forward to going through the car buying process again.  Adam and Classic Toyota went above and beyond making it a totally painless process. Came in about $90 lower than what we had given them as our monthly payment budget. The car is way more than I expected to get for what we were looking to pay. I would definitely recommend Adam Reynolds and Classic Toyota. ",5.0

8,"November 07, 2019","We bought a new Prius Prime last May and we love the car and were happy when we drove off the lot. It’s been downhill from there. We’ve had so many issues with service since then that I regret buying the car. No one returns calls, they treat me like a “dumb girl” when I call on the issues. This last time we were there for routine service, they put the wrong wheel on our car when the rotated the tires. How does that even happen? And when I called them the first time they didn’t even bother to call me back. When I did finally my reach someone (5 days later) he talked down to me until I put my husband on the phone. Service Manager, Scott - still waiting for your call back. Lance, the tire guy, make it right for us when we see you.",1.0

25,"May 09, 2019",Walked in to check out the Highlander and walked out with a certified pre owned Hybrid. Tristan and Bentlie were respectful and helpful. I certainly recommend the dealership and I am a fan of the way they do business. Didn’t really intend to but a car that day so they had to do a couple of special things for us in order to make it happen logistically.

43,"February 13, 2019","    My wife and I now own our third Camry. The present one is a 2017 Camry XSE with a fourcylinder engine. Our sales experience was a good one. Our service experience has been a bit different. Toyota offers free service visits for the first 25,000 miles.  As we drove and used our new car the only problem that arose was that one of the tire and wheel assemblies began to lose air. We revealed this to the service personnel every time we took it in because we were concerned. They assured us they were looking into the problem by checking the tire and the air pressure sensor. They could find nothing wrong yet we continued having to add air periodically. We even dealt with the ""tire supervisor."" Long story short, here we are two years and over 39,000 miles and we still have to add air to the same tire periodically. For a manufacturer who has for years prided themselves on the long lasting quality of the Toyota name, this recent experience has not left us confident. ",3.4
44,"February 10, 2019",Nate Bazzell was so knowledgeable about the Toyota Camry and Corolla that he was showing me.  He answered all my questions. He made my experience a pleasure.

72,"July 11, 2018","After searching for weeks, at many dealerships in three states and several major cities, I got lucky and I finally found the car I was seeking at Classic Toyota of Tyler.  Even though they knew they had the car I badly wanted, they didn't take advantage and they bent over backwards to earn my business. 

I was very impressed with the importance of customer satisfaction after the sale as I was contacted by my salesman Justin Pennetta, who got in touch with the previous owner and acquired the second key and remote fob.

After hearing a sales pitch to do everything and more (like getting the power steering and brake lines flushed out), I was feeling uncomfortable with the service advisor so I went online to check their customer reviews.  Yikes.  I decided I needed to make the drive to CLASSIC where I bought the car 9 years ago.  Not only did JOEL WILKINSON have a mechanic look at it immediately (it was 4:20 on a Friday) he offered a Saturday morning appointment and even loaned me a car to drive home and back in.  They did everything that was needed, advised against the superfluous stuff the other advisor was trying to sell, told me the hoses and brakes were still in excellent condition - having checked the whole car over - and gave me a better price. Kudos to Joel.  BTW, he was also the salesman 9 years ago who sold me the car.   I'll be back in about three years to buy a new Prius from CLASSIC.   (Don't bug me guys, I said THREE years.

Classic toyotas admin department was able to help supply and send any needed paperwork to the involved companies for the total loss claim. It helped the claim run smoothly and quickly. Recently I purchased a 2015 Toyota Corolla again from Cosme and am very pleased. I got an even better deal the second time around. If you are looking for a new or used car Cosme at Classic Toyota in Tyler is the guy to see!! ,5.0

177,"July 11, 2016","I came into Classic Toyota not sure about when and what car I wanted, but the staff really was very friendly and helpful. Mr. Mcgill approached me when I came. Usually I hate when dealers come and harass me with a sales pitch, but  Mr. Mcgill showed great patience and knowledge on how to help me with what car was perfect for me. Overall I had a great experience at Classic Toyota.",4.8

She was very friendly, warm and sincere. I will definately be back to do business with her in the future. The new car manager and all of the others were great as well.",4.8
179,"June 28, 2016","Mike Taylor is the best salesperson I've ever worked with. He's honest, knowledgeable, and really seems to want to help his customers out. I just bought my second vehicle from him and I would and actually already have recommended him and Classic Toyota. I've had dealings with multiple Toyota dealerships acorss the state of Texas and none even come close to Classic. No one here has ever tried to rip me off, they're always fast, and they're just friendly. I do not live in East Texas full time anymore but I always try to get my maintenance done when I'm in the area so I can get it done at Classic. I can count the number of reviews I've written on one hand but they really are that good. I just had to brag on them. Classic Toyota and Mike Taylor are the best.",5.0
180,"June 27, 2016","I purhased my car from Brent Hallford.  He was very knowledgeable and really listened to what I wanted. He did his best to find the right car on his lot and called me when one with ""amenities"" I could afford came in.  He also listened to what I knew about pricing and let me have time to think it over. If definitely recommend Classic Toyota simply because he works there.",5.0
181,"June 27, 2016","My experience with your sales person Chris Mabry made me give your Company an A Plus. He did the one thing that so many sales people do not do. He listened ! He did not try to push me, just asked me what was important to me. He has a very good sense of humor and is down to Earth. Keep him on and he will sell the cars!

182,"June 22, 2016","This is my 4th vehicle to purchase through this dealership.  The first 2 were great experiences, however, the third wasn't.  I was dis-enchanted with the third vehicle and now after working with Brett Norris my faith has been restored.  Brett was very attentive to my need for the proper vehicle and he worked diligently to restore my faith and to find a good dependable pre-owned car that I could afford.  There were a few minor cosmetic problems that had to be addressed and he made sure they were completed and that I was happy with the vehicle.  Everyone at the dealership was very friendly and helpful each time I was in their  location.   I plan to continue using this dealership in any future transactions and highly recommend that you contact Brett as your representative in purchasing your next vehicle.",4.4

186,"October 28, 2015","My daughter picked her Mercedes from their body shop.  Driving revealed a banging noise coming from the side of the car they ""repaired"".  I looked under the car and found they had not put the plastic clips back in the rocker panel after they painted it.  They claim they were already missing.  Does this sound like an argument you want to have with someone charging you $2580.00 to replace a fender and repair a rocker panel?  If your answer is YES, contact Matt Lawson.",1.2
187,"June 10, 2014","I would love to warn everyone to stay away from Classic Toyota in Tyler Texas.  They have the worst customer service and they sell cars that they know are bad and they will not fix the cars even if the car is under warranty.  The staff at Classic Toyota have treated me terrible. Please do not buy a car from there, they are horrible and they have treated me like a dog.  ",1.0
188,"April 10, 2014","My previous version of this post cast a dark light on this dealership, but after a recent call with the manager Phil McDaniels, that's been put aside. It seemed that it was primarily a lack of communication and standards missed that caused the bad experience during the service on our truck. They know how to fix their mistakes, which shows a lot for their dealership. ",4.7

Wanted another Toyota Camry (would have been my 4th); the ignorant Carlos ignored me to convince my spouse to buy another used Prius   Thank God we unloaded this unbelievable lemon.   We're back to buying great Toyotas from a reputable dealer who actually listens to the customer/driver!   Would never, ever do business with these folks again!   They have total disregard for any driver (even if they're 20 year Toyota customers).",1.0
192,"September 30, 2011","I brought my car in for a 60k service. I was told my brakes needed repair.  I had just had this dealer repair my brakes a few months earlier and wasn't satisfied so I went to my trusted repair shop to get the brakes done. To make a long story short.
I had brake rotors turned 3 times in less than a year.  Two times in less than 5,000 miles.
I feel this dealer makes a quick buck on their customers once they get the car into the shop. They take that opportunity to do unnecessary work and most customers blindly trust the dealers expertise.
I have a hard time believing any car needs brake repairs 3 times in less than 7,000 miles.
This past 12 months I spent close to $900.00 for brakes.
If they hadn't sold m on their advantage package that supposedly saves me money on routine maintenance, I wouldn't take the car there again.
The pre-paid oil changes I have had so far have cost me a small fortune in repairs on a car that was supposed to be ""Certified pre-owned"" ad checked out by them for needed repairs.",2.4
