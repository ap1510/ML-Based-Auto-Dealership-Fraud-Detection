19,"November 26, 2019",It took them two trys and the second time after keeping the truck for two weeks and not working on it i had to just go get it. they do not return a call they do not answer the phone. the managers there dont care if you have a problem or not. I had rain water leaking in the truck and they were supposed to pull the carpet up and fix the leak. Not sure any of that happened. they the only excuse they could give me for the 3 hour job taking 3 weeks was they were short handed and the mechanic mashed his hand with a hammer.  i had an appointment and took the truck in when they asked but they count tell me why they didnt have time to work on it. ,1.0

22,"October 19, 2019","I had been looking for a new Ford F150, I had done my homework and narrowed down the Dealership's to three, Ron Carter was rated number 1 on my list of Dealerships to visit. So I worked my way from the bottom of the list from number 3 to number 1, I did visit other dealership and had out the door prices on the F150's I was looking at. 

I walked into Ron Carter Ford, and was meet by Louis Whitecotton, I explained what I was looking for and Louis went right to work. and within less then an hour I had the price I was looking for. The price I got from Ron Carter Ford made me wander how the other two Dealerships keep in business.

All in All, In the 40 years of me buying new cars, Louis and the Ron Carter Ford Dealership is one of the best Dealerships I have EVER worked with. Two thumbs up.  ",5.0
23,"September 29, 2019","We had been researching a Ford truck purchase for some time and had ended up with a CarPro dealer due to their radio show and the thought that we were getting the best deal.  Just prior to purchase we decided to contact Ron Carter Alvin to see their prices since we purchased a Toyota several years prior and had also been working with Dub for another auto purchase.  Turns out that the Ron Carter price beat the CarPro dealer price first try with no haggling and our experience with Ron Carter was excellent from start to finish.  Listening to the CarPro radio show I never thought that would be possible but this is true and I never provided what the CarPro price was.  We worked with Dub who's office is at the Ron Carter Alvin Chevy dealership BUT sells ALL Ron Carter automobiles.  Dub was outstanding, zero pressure, always delivered on what was promised, and made our experience wonderful.  We will definitely purchase from Ron Carter Alvin again!!",5.0

39,"May 11, 2019",Paul made the experience the best it could have possibly been. Ron Carter did not have the truck I wanted at the dealership but Paul did a TON of leg work in order to find my truck and get a dealer trade in order to get the deal done. He did all the searching to find my truck 180 miles away and work it up to get here and get the deal done within just a few days. I have never had a salesman work as hard and do as much work for me as Paul did for me. Some salesmen can be very pushy and make things uncomfortable. Paul was very patient working with me to find out exactly what I wanted. some salesmen make you feel like you need to hurry up and decide. Paul made me feel like he was a true friend and wanted me to get exactly what i wanted. I have never had a better salesmen than Paul Moreno!,5.0

Called Ron Carter Ford service and Allison set me up with an appointment and even had a car waiting for us when we got there to drop off our car. We had purchased the extended warranty through Ford and they honored it, supplying  us with a rental when we got there. They took care  of our car and of us. When I went to pick up my care found out some of the stuff Gulf Coast Ford was charging to our warranty was not needing to be replaced.

He went above and beyond to make sure that we were happy throughout the entire process. We definitely recommend doing business here! Most pleasant car buying experience of our lives! Even the financial department was pleasant to deal with and we were not pressured into purchasing any additional warranties that we didn't want. Another thing we appreciate about this dealership is that they do not price bait you online...they only list incentives for which everyone qualifies. ",5.0

59,"May 05, 2018","I have purchased many vehicles over the past 40 plus years and I can't recall at any other dealerships the excellent customer service I was given.  My salesman, Cesar Oliveira went beyond the call to help me select the vehicle I wanted.  Even though he told me he had only been working at Ron Carter for two days, I would not have known it.  It was evident that had previous sales experience and I thank the dealership for hiring such quality personnel. I purchased a Promaster 3500 cargo van from Cesar that had all the equipment I was looking for.  There was no pressure from Cesar or the dealership to purchase from them.  I also want to give credit to Santo Cabrera, the Sales Manager for his assistance in making my experience pleasant. If you are looking for a new vehicle, I highly recommend Ron Carter and Cesar Oliverira.  TELL THEM JOE SENT YOU!!!",5.0
60,"March 29, 2018","I have a 2013 Chevrolet Suburban that has a second water leak on a body seam leaking into the passengers floorboard. To back up a little bit this car replaced a 2010 Tahoe that had a roof that was leaking and they were going to have to replace the roof on the car. So we got the suburban thinking that the Tahoe was just a lemon and this one would be better. Well back to the leaking car. I took the car to the dealership and was told that it was probably leaking around the windshield that had been replaced. So I made an appointment with the body shop and they tested the windshield and found no leaks. A couple of weeks later I am back at the dealership and was told that it was going to cost around $300.00 to diagnose the problem. I was called later and told it was a body seam leaking and that it was not covered. I asked if I could come take pictures ( they would not let me take pictures of the first leak ). I asked if I could come take pictures and I was told that they hadn't taken the car apart yet but when they did I could take pictures. When I got there to take pictures I was told it was leaking behind a blob of caulking that GM smears on the seams. I made the comment that any normal person could see that if the blob of caulking would have been smeared in the area of the leak it would not have leaked. I asked them how they would repair the leak and the answer was to put some more caulking in the area behind the original blob of caulking. So in other words where the other caulking should have been. Their answer was always the same, I don't know.  I have a case on this problem with GM and the service department  will not mention to them that if the caulking would have smeared in the area that was leaking  it may have never leaked. All they would mention to them was the car had been in an accident in which the body shop told me there was no damage in that area.  They also told GM that it may have been cause by the way I drive, weather conditions, or the flexing of the vehicle that cracks the body sealant causing it to separate  ( I did not see any cracks or separation ). I went back to the dealership and told them I needed documentation as to what caused it to leak and also that something stating that the door gasket and wires running along the threshold of the door had been under water because of the water leak and I was told I had all of the documentation on my invoice I was going to get. All it said was where body seam was leaking  and that it was fixed.  I was told that the corporate person was just giving me the run around. This will probably be the last general motors vehicle I ever buy and defiantly this dealership. Nobody wants to help you so I just wanted to share my experience with everyone  so that hopefully it doesn't happen to you'll.   ",1.0

Your knowledge, competence and helpful nature was wonderful. Your willingness to work with me and find me what I was looking for was exactly what I wanted in a Salesperson.

I went to pick it up and was charged 128 dollars instead of the quoted 63.95. The receipt did not even explain what the charges were for. It said customer declined service 128 dollars and had two entries where tech did something which I assume was the diagnostics 0 dollars. In total it was 137 dollars not 63.95. I ordered the pcm online and got it for 175 dollars including shipping. I had to wait almost three weeks for it to arrive but in ten minutes after it did my car was up and running. 1,100 dollars?  No I won't recommend a business who tells you one thing and then does completely the opposite . What happened to a person's word being honored?

111,"August 29, 2016","On April 29th, I came into your Ron Carter Dealership at the Alvin Ron Carter. I met with your salesperson Fernando, and explained my situation.  I'm a disabled combat veteran, I'm new to the area, and I needed a truck I can rely on. I've never bought from a dealership before, but I wanted to buy from someone I could trust.  Fernando sold me a 2007 Ford F-150 for $9100.  Since that time, I've driven fewer than a thousand miles.  It should have been a red flag when the keys I was given wouldn't open the doors (luckily the fob works).  But then three weeks ago my steering rod sheered off. Ron Carter told me they couldn't look at it for at least a week, leaving me stranded. I had it towed to a reputable mechanic who immediately noticed that in addition to the steering rod, the front bearings needed to be replaced and the rear pinion was leaking and unsafe for long distance driving (good thing I found out before trying to drive up to help an Army buddy move at Ft. Hood). The mechanic also said the rotors needed to be replaced and that someone had put pads on bad rotors - something that should have been obvious to the dealer. As a disabled veteran, I have limited income, but I was able to scrape together $1600 to pay for everything but the rotors. Next, as I went to get the brakes fixed at a mechanic near my apartment, the top casing of one of my spark plugs broke off. After the mechanic fixed the spark plug and the rotors (I owe $700 for that), they noticed that there is something wrong with my piston, and that I need to buy a new motor. Both mechanics told me that everything that was wrong, with the exception of the spark plug, should have been noticed during an inspection.  I trusted your dealership, and I trusted Fernando. Now I'm left wondering: was I deliberately sold a defective vehicle because you knew I was new to the area, had no support network and you assumed that as a disabled vet I wouldn't have the money or resources to do anything about it, or do all of your used vehicles have these defects and all customers should be concerned?

152,"March 16, 2016","Purchased a used vehicle less than six months ago.  Brought it in for a 75,000 mile tune up.  They said it would be $600 to repair belts and hoses along with an oil change.  No problem, I paid them and wanted my car to continue running properly.  Drove it away from the dealership and the check engine light came on after which the vehicle lost power.  It would drive, but there was definitely something wrong.  Brought it back immediately.  They repaired it as a covered repair.  Drove it away from the dealership, and the same thing happened.  Brought it back in, same as before.  Drove away from dealership and it did the same thing.  Brought it back.  This time they wanted another $600 to repair it.  So I paid it.  Drove it away, and the same thing happened.  Brought it back and then they wanted $1500 to repair vehicle.  I feel like I got swindled.  Either the shop couldn't repair the vehicle or they sold me a bad vehicle.  They had no interest in helping me.  They are very friendly as they rake you over the coals.

We were greeted by a salesman by the name of Dominique James and we purchased 2 vehicles from him that week. a Ford F150 and a brand new Ford Fiesta for our daughter.  We had the best car buying experience of our lives.  Everyone from Dominique to Finance to the Service Dept. they were all so very pleasant and easy to work with.  We owned our truck for 32 days and unfortunately our daughter had an accident while driving our truck and it was totaled.  Our daughter is safe and we owe it to the F150.  We called Dominique and emailed him on October 20 to let him know what happened and that we will need another vehicle.  Dominique took time out of his day to email us back check on our daughter and let us know  he was on vacation  and would return on Wednesday October 21 and he will get busy and start looking for our replacement vehicle.  Today October 24, 2015 we signed the papers on our new F150 4X4.   Dominique went above and beyond for us.  He knew we wouldn't settle and was so patient with us.  He sent pictures and kept in constant daily contact with us. We said we would never purchase a vehicle from anyone else other Ron Carter after our first two purchases and now our third purchase just reconfirmed our statement!  Dominique James is am amazing young man and we wish him nothing but happiness and success in his future endeavors!  We hope Ron Carter realizes just what a huge asset he truly is!!

Three issues with truck,  Slight rattle on heat deflector on passenger side, exhaust leak and transmission shifting hard from 1st-2nd (which comes and goes).  Nice service rep said for a mere ($70-140) per item which means up to $420, he could tell me what needed to be done to repair the items.  I told him I had gotten a notice from GMC on the transmission issue and he kept stressing his mechanics needed to get paid and that ""IF"" the extended warranty (which apparently isn't even a gmc item) would cover any of it, they would delete that initial screen, otherwise I would be out up to $420 to determine what was wrong with vehicle and then give me an estimate of how much to repair.  The service rep obviously knew nothing about cars, but he did know he needed to get a signed document saying I would pay up to $420 so his mechanics could get paid.  After a 10 minute tightening of exhaust pipe to manifold and installing a secondary clamp on a GMC poor design heat deflector, I was out of non-dealer shop with a total $25 bill...  go figure.

238,"August 31, 2015"," My wife and I have been coming to Ron carter for almost 15 years. In that time we purchased 6 cars and we have brought several family and friends to Ron Carter and every time has been great. This experience has way exceeded my expectations. Not only did Dy Chhoeun take his time to help me he came in on his day off to meet me a 2nd day. When I still could not make up my mind he brought in Jay Ali who is fantastic, he took his time with me and helped me find exactly what I wanted with no pressure. They just wanted me to be happy. Because I needed a truck to pull a travel trailer I had very specific needs and this is where Martin Williamson came in. He got me all the information I needed to make the right choice and also made sure my new truck had everything I needed to pull our travel trailer. I can not say enough about these 3 men. I am very happy and will continue to be a loyal customer for many years to come. Thank you all for such a great experience. I can be very difficult yet you all were patient and understanding and most of all you did not give up until you found me exactly what I wanted. Thank you again. ",4.7

245,"August 28, 2015","I made this purchase fairly easy. I had my financing in order and I already had my vehicle picked out. I saw it one day, and went to buy in the next (I had test driven one at a different dealership). I was often sitting and waiting while my sales man worked several people at the same time. Nobody even went over the car with me. Even when I bought it back in bc the car wasn't working right, and I wrote in the note to the service department that I needed an orientation - nothing! When I came to pick the car up, nobody helped me. Nobody called to let me know my plates were in. They sent me out with expired paper plates. I drove WAY out of my way and it was NOT worth it. I was hassled for everything they needed, but when it came to MY needs - it was like a ghost town in there. I returned several times but was never assisted. They sold me a faulty car (screen flickers, loud outside noise, rattling, transmission pulls, car sputters, etc.). I bought a brand new, $80,000 Denali/Yukon XL and was treated like garbage. I also told them I wanted to return the car (as they advertise you can return the car within 5 days). Of course they really don't let you - they just say they will fix the problem.....until the 5 days is over and then they don't have to honor it. There were other shady things too that had to do with credit union and being a veteran, but that's a whole other issue!!! ",1.4

He was assigned to me, Christian WIlliams, a very nice individual.  Wonderful person to work with, he took my phone calls, we went over everything to see what could be worked out, I was interested in the pre-owned CHrysler Town & COuntry and that could not be worked out due to the unpside down on my vehicle.  So I left the dealership, he called me and said he had talked to management and that we could work out something on a new vehicle, was I still interested.  I explained the need for a high sitting up vehicle to keeps the legs straight, and one that was not close to the ground.  We went over a few and I mentioned the Ford  FLEX, and it took off from there.  I am now in my new FLEX and it is wonderful, great driving vehicle and roomy.  ",5.0

290,"July 20, 2015","I bought a 2015 Silvarado LTZ 2500 HD with the Duramax engine. The two salespeople (Don L. Wolfe and Leon Lundy could not have been more honest and forthright and informative. I had done my research and knew exactly where I needed to be to get a good deal and they were on point and fair straight out of the gate. It was much appreciated and I would recommend either of them any day.

The frustrating part was the finance dept. I know the usual tricks etc, I had my I's dotted and my T's crossed. I had already checked my own credit with MYFICO.com so I knew all three of my credit scores were over 800 or ""bullet"" credit as they say in the car business. I had already checked with my credit union and knew what their interest rate was so I had an idea of what would be considered ""very competitive"" if you could qualify. Part of the sales price on the deal was that I was to be financed with GMAC, Allied or Wells Fargo. Bottom line, the finance guy tells me that my credit is excellent but since I don't have any debt or revolving accounts that the creditors won't offer me their best rates. So he comes in with a deal from some bank I've never heard of that I'm sure gives him a nice piece of the action on the back end. What a bunch of baloney. When financing a car creditors don't care how much you make, how much your worth or anything other than your credit score for the most part. I don't blame the finance guy for trying to make a point on me if I am uninformed enough to let it happen. However, when I call you out on it you need to be honest and give me your best deal and make it painless instead of giving me the run around and costing me an extra 30 minutes arguing the point. I ended up getting rates comparative to what my credit union offered so I got a good deal in the end but it could have been a lot less painless. Bottom line is I didn't need financing at all, I just wanted it because the money was cheap. When you have an informed buyer that qualifies for the best deals and knows it don't insult them by giving them the run around.

Again, my salespeople were outstanding. I could not have asked for more. Thanks again Don L. Wolfe and Leon Lundy.

Sincerely,

Sam Dever",4.8

332,"June 16, 2015","After going back and forth with some local dealerships and becoming frustrated with the dog and pony shows - the ones where you can never get an answer to a simple qestion like, how much is it going to cost me? - I went to Ron Carter Ford in Alvin. 

Best decision I made in my quest for a new truck. A phone call located my truck, a followup phone call satisfied me that I was going to get the price I expected. hat I did not know was that all of the preliminary stuff the other dealers were putting me through was already finished. We got to the dealership, signed some papers, even purhased an extended warrenty.  By the time we were through, the truck had been cleaned and received a full tank of gas. 

From the time we got on the property to the handshake and ""congragluations on your new truck"" was less than two hours. I spent more time than that at one dealership just waiting for the manager to come back from lunch so the salesman could tell me if they could find a truck for me with the options I wanted! 

Our experience a Ron Carter was outstanding and I will definately be telling people where I got my truck and WHY!

Ron Carter's staff listened to what we wanted, what we were looking for, and never tried to pressure us into buying anything. At the end Ford ended up providing the best options, the safest vehicle compared to what we used to drive, and Ron Carter was the company of choice. We went out there Friday evening at 10 minutes before closing (we thought we had more than 2 hrs), and instead of telling us they were about to close they recognized us from the week before, showed us what they had in stock that evening and 2 hrs later we left owning a new car.

After I told them the specific car, I was able to test drive the vehicle and was told after we can sit down and talk about price. When I went and sat down when them he told me the price and that's when I started to try to negotiate with them. That's when every thing hit the fan. He gave me all the tactics for selling I told him I wasn't interested in the asking price after he dropped the asking price It still seemed high to m and it could be lowered just a little. Sammy Jimenez was our sales consultant went to speak to the sale manager. After a 10 minutes the manager and mr. Jimenez came to talk to us and the manger came very rude he told me that the price could not drop any more then it was and that where did I get my information from. After telling him what I did my research online. He told me that the days of negotiating price are over in today's world. He then told me in his words "" I am manager I call the shots here not you!, I could sell this car at auction and I would rather do that then lower the price I would get more there, maybe this car isn't for you and you can find another dealer!"" All this was said when I started to negotiate price and because I had done my research ahead of time. He did not like that I knew what I was talking about. I ended up staying to see what my trade in would go for towards the car and they gave me an ok amount not great but I felt like I was belittled and didn't have any say any more. I had told him I was not going to put anything down, later he told me the bank was asking for money down on the car but that wasn't the case they just wanted pocket money for the dealer ship to make more profit off of me. When I told him I wanted  to see what the payment and interest rate was before we even consider that there would be a down payment. He told me to wait for the finance depart to discuss with them. When I discussed with them the payment the loan officer told me the payment and what I was financing for with down payment I told them that I didn't want to put a down payment. He then told me the deal couldn't be done. The bank wanted a down payment. I told them thanks for the time but I can't do that. I proceeded to walk to get my key to the vehicle I was trading in . Mr. Jimenez then came up to me and told me that why couldn't I put money down. I then told
Min that I didn't want to. He then told
Me that you can't even put $500 down. Which seemed odd since they told me that the bank was telling them I had to put money down and that with out it the loan could not be approved? I knew at that point for sure that , that money wasn't going towards the car but the sales mans pocket. I told him I would not put anything down. He then got my keys and told me rudely walking away from me that I can't help you then! Over all I didn't like being talked down to so rudely, they had no compassion or didn't even care about what I wanted what so ever. They do not have friendly customer Service! I wasted 5 hours there!

They took the the time to explain everything but I was still not ready they understood and did not pressure me to get the vehicle right away.

390,"May 03, 2015","I desperately needed a new car. Before we went any place my partner said we are going to explore options. So our first stop was Clear Lake Nissan. We test drove a 2015 Nissan Altima. I was nice. It had the sunroof, technology package, heated seats, leather, and it was blue. Oh and the bose speakers in it as well They were asking 31,600 for the car. It was brand new. Only 13 miles on the car. So we go in and sit and they are asking well what payments are you looking for and what so on and so on. We stayed there for 3 hours. They were trying to push us in to buying this car. We told them from the get we were going to Ron Carter to look to see what yall could offer. So the next day we went to Ron Carter. I was referred to Jason O'brien from my cousin. As soon as we pulled up and gentleman came and was very pleasant. He located Jason for us. Jason was AWESOME!!!!! He asked a few questions and took us right away to a car that was perfect! We test drove it and when we got back he showed us other options but my 2015 Ford Taurus SEL  was the winner. We got the process started fairly quickly. I traded my car in and was given a fair deal and proceed the process. Throughout the whole process Jason was cool clan and collective.... I was a bag of nerves. He explained everything to me as it was happening.  Went to financing and came back with some numbers that were doable. It wasn't were I wanted to be but we could make it work. Signed papers then drove off in my new ride. Thank you so much Ron Carter and Especially to Jason O'brien for all your help with finding me my new WHIP!!!!! LOVE IT! I will be back to see Jason and to purchase my partner car there and many more I'm sure. Thank you so much.",5.0

468,"November 28, 2014","I have had some very bad experiences with Ron Carter. Stay away from the Jeep Grand Cherokee, they have many issues.  I bought a 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee from Ron Carter and traded it in after just having it for a couple of months, to many issues with it.  You might want to check with the Federal Transportation Safety Board web site before you buy one.   I took a pretty good lose trading a two month old vehicle back to Ron Carter, but I was spending too much time with the Jeep Grand Cherokee issues and my families safety is important to me.  I was not going to let my family members ride in the new Jeep and possible lose their life. I would have never bought it if I had found out about its issues before hand.  I would have to write a book to tell you about the problems I had with Ron Carter and the 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee I purchased from them.  I have a current safety issue that I feel potential buyers need to be made aware of. 
 I Purchased a 2014 Dodge 1500 Ram 4x4. Well, now I have safety issues with it and it seems as if Ron Carter could care less, they've made the sell, made a profit, now we will get to your problem in a few weeks.  I want to give the public a warning about the safety concern of the 2014 Dodge Ram.  I will also be filling a complaint with the Federal Transportation Safety Board.  New vehicles should not be a safety hazard; I would not drive this Dodge Ram in Houston for any amount of money.   The safety concern is that while driving down the road the vehicle loses all power, floor board the accelerator and no response or on occasion you press the accelerator a little and the vehicle goes into the passing gear and lunges forward to fast.  These conditions are truly a safety issue and could possible cause a wreck.  I immediately took the truck to Ron Carter to get it looked at.  I was told by the service adviser that it was not a big deal to get corrected, the computer just needed to be calibrated.  The problem, he advised me that it would be a couple of weeks before they could even look at it.  That Ron Carter was so far behind on their work and they were trying to get caught up and I would have to schedule an appointment just to get it looked at.  OK, I told him that I would like to make an appointment, I was informed that the service reps were not allowed to make appointments or allowed to take any work in, that I must contact the appointment setter by telephone.  He gave me the number and extension, I called, but they were not working yet.  I drove home and called again, the appointment setter informed me that she could only set appointments for oil changes, that I would have to contact the service department, I informed her that I had and they told me to call her.  She then told me that only the service manager could make appointments and that she would send my information to him and then he would contact me for the appointment.  Seven days later, I‚Äôm still waiting for a call to make an appointment to get my truck looked at.  Hence, I have a 2014 Dodge Ram 1500 4x4 sitting in my driveway and will not drive it into Houston because I don‚Äôt trust it to be safe.  So, in conclusion buyer beware, you might want to consider staying away from Ron Carter.

Recently I was referred to a slaes person (Victor Rivas) at Ron Carter Chevrolet.  I called Victor then went down there and drove a couple cars we had talked about over the phone, culminating with a purhase of the vehicle (2014 Impala) I liked best.  Victor was very professional and helpful and negotiated with me in good faith whereby I got a great deal on the car (less than NADA value) with literally no hassle or games.  Alvin is a bit out of my way but the drive was well worth it and I'll make it again next time.

We did see a couple of low mileage Impala LTZs, and we test drove them both. Nice cars - quiet and comfrtable, but they were parked next to a 2012 Mercdes C250 with low mileage that I just couldn't resist. Our sales person, Koy Alford was great. After we decided on the MB, he started the purchasing process and kept it moving from step to step. We drove away with it a few hours later - all paper work complete. In my 45 years of buying cars, this was the least pressured, fastest, most enjoyable car buying experiece I've had. ",5.0
478,"October 08, 2014","I found this Tacoma on the internet. There were no pictures posted so I called to ask if they could post pictures to help me decide if I wanted to drive the 20 miles to see the truck.  I know that these trucks go fast, so I was in a hurry to get it done before it was gone.  One of the guys (can't remember his name), told me that he would have pictures posted by 11 that morning, never did happen. The bad thing is, he never did contact me to let me know why. Later when I met him at the dealer, he told me he left voice messages, NOT TRUE I did not get any voice messages from him. 
I also e-mailed Jerrica Trahan  and asked her to post pictures, she responded by telling me that they would take pictures after the rain.  OK...so I responded to her by asking if they had some place indoors they could move the truck and get pictures.  She then responded in a way that I found very sarcastic, that It was raining and they would get pictures once it stopped. I did not think that my question was unreasonable, so I responded to her e-mail saying not to bother with the pictures, that I would take my business elsewhere.
Then I got an e-mail from Amy Rivera asking if she could help in any way, so since I really liked the truck, I decided to give it another chance.  Once I explained to Amy what had happened, she took control and had pictures posted in minutes. After I saw the pictures, I asked Amy about the drive out price, she informed me that that was not her department and hooked me up with Pat.  For the record, if it wasn't for Amy, I would not have purchased the truck.
Then I Received an e-mail from Pat Thomas asking if there was anything he could do to help. Pat was very helpful and professional and did not pressure me into anything.  He sent me the  information that I requested, which helped me decide to visit the dealer. Once at the dealer, Pat was very patient and helpful. I also felt that he was answering all of my questions (which were many) honestly and as best he could with the knowledge that he had of the truck.
I found 3 concerns with the truck that I asked Pat if the dealership would correct.  A bent bumper, which they agreed to correct. The smell inside the truck, which they agreed to correct.  The air pressure monitor light was flashing, which they would not correct......Later I figured out why.  I had to pay $326 to get it fixed.
I also was not impressed at all with the detail on the truck. I stated to Pat that I could have done a better job in my back yard.  Because of these concerns, I left the dealership still undecided. If the truck would have had a proper detail, there is no doubt that I would have driven it home that day. 
Well, a day later, I received an E-mail from Amy asking if there was anything else she could help me, and she informed me that the truck was still available. Before this e-mail, I was still on the fence, but this e-mail persuaded me to purchase the truck.
I called Pat and asked him to prep the truck and I would be in to pick it up. Once back at the dealer, Pat had the truck and all of the paper work ready.  He took me over to a finance guy (don't know his name) to complete the transaction.  I was not at all impressed with this guys professionalism or his attitude.  First, I was not invited  into his office, we did the paperwork in the showroom.  Second, when I refused the extended warranty, he made a smart remark to me. 
As a final note, my ratings or based on my total experience with this dealer. The service that I received from Amy and Pat or the only reason that I purchased this truck. There just seemed to be to much drama among the employees of the dealership.",2.6

518,"June 27, 2014","My husband and I visited Ron Carter Dodge Chrysler Jeep in Alvin Texas with the intention of purchasing a new Jeep Wrangler Unlimited. The experience started on a bad note, however, as the vehicle I originally wanted was sold right out from under us. The salesman who took over my sale at that point began to go over and above to find my a jeep I liked as well as the one I had originally picked out. His name is Doug Davis, and I was more than pleased with his level of dedicated customer service. Even when my husband and I changed our minds halfway through the sale, he simply smiled and we started over. Later he commented that he was hoping I would choose the second model, as he thought I would be more satisfied in the end. He was awesome to the end, hanging out with us for an hour after the dealership closed to wait for them to wash and gas up our new vehicle, in order to get in it with me and help me get acquainted with it. I have to admit, after being there for nearly seven hours, because of this guy's attitude and effort, it was still an exciting experience. I want to thank Doug for making sure that the experience of buying the vehicle I had been waiting to buy for many years was everything it should have been!

533,"May 21, 2014","As my title indicates, I had an OUTSTANDING experience, which I wasn't expecting, especially having already dealt with a not so upfront dealer on the north side of town a few days earlier, who used low price offers (0, 0, 0) to lure you in, but once there.... well, you know the rest, things were not what they seemed, or as ADVERTISED in the newspaper!  As a result, I  W A L K E D!  Because of the prior poor experience at the ""other"" dealership, I decided not to physically go to another, and simply chose to deal with them online.  What happened after that restored my faith in car dealerships and salesmen---who I'd always equated to vultures and great white sharks! I got to cut out the middle man and was able to speak to and deal directly with the sales manager, Harry Shapiro, who I described my bad experience to, and he then cut through all of the red tape, and through the bullcrap, to match the other dealer's price, down to the last cent. I knew that I was getting a great deal, because the price was over $1,000 less than Consumer Reports' bottom line price. He even attempted to get me a better finance offer, one better than my credit union had already worked up for me. Now THAT's grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrreat customer service.  Harry had to go out of town for a few days, but left me in the very capable hands of Steven Gilbreath, and he even kept making sure that my experience was moving right along without a hitch.  Steve picked up right where Harry left off.  He picked me up from work and brought me to the dealership to close the deal, he showed me how all of the facinating gadgets work on my new Yukon, and answered ANY and ALL questions that I had. Since purchasing my new vehicle, I have continued to hear from both of them. I can honestly say, after having purchased 4 NEW vehicles in my lifetime (prior to this one), that this was the best vehicle buying experience I've E V E R had! They MAY have just restored my faith in car dealerships and salesmen!  The online rep, my true 1st contact, who popped a picture of my new big boy [Yukon] up for me to see, also deserves a lot of credit!  She too was knowledgeable and I must say, that doing business that way---having an online component, to lure customers in is VERY efficient and saves time and gas!

It is our hometown dealership. However, in the past years we didn't always have the best experience there. Then we met MIKE OWENS. He is a GREAT SALESMAN. He's ""our"" style of sales guy. Very familiar with what's there on the lot. What packages the vehicles have or what's available for that model. Willing to go find ""another"" vehicle somewhere @ the lot, WITH A SMILE on his face! He is laid back, easy going, not in your face and down your throat. When we went to the dealership a couple of weeks ago, we were pleasantly surprised to find out that MIKE OWENS was still a sales person there at RON CARTER. He had sold us our 2011 F150. We found him and the search was on for my new work car. He took us all over the lot and let us test drive everything. Without hesitation, walking back to get the keys for yet another vehicle with a, ""Not a problem"" and smile on his face! It's been hot here. We were still undecided, told him we were going to think about it a little more. So this past Saturday we went back, found our guy, MIKE, drove a couple more vehicles and purchased a brand new FORD ESCAPE TITANIUM. He actually had to hunt this one down because it had just gotten to the dealership. But like a trooper he tracked it down. It had every option we wanted and a few more. We totally enjoyed buying the ESCAPE. I can't say that about other vehicles we've purchased at other dealerships in the past. Where you're excited about a new car, then you have to go do the ""dance"" in the office. And leave like you've just been totally screwed over!

I am very happy with my new truck, my wife loves it and all my church members loves how nice it looks.

Todd Price:
Please send written confirmation of the work that was performed Wednesday, December 18th, and Thursday, December 19th.  This should include:
¬∑         any deficiency that was identified in the front end alignment that required adjustment;
¬∑         what the assessment concluded regarding the hood latch and what work was performed on this item if any;
¬∑         what conclusions were drawn or work performed regarding the noise being created inside the vehicle when adjusting the air conditioning;
¬∑         what condition is creating the slow response in the right front (passenger) window;
¬∑         performance of full interior and exterior detail as verbally agreed upon at close of sale due to inclement weather on the date of sale.
Additionally, please confirm the following:
¬∑         status on the amplifier missing from the 2010 Dodge Ram with your manager Martin Williamson, and
¬∑         confirmation that ‚Äúyour guy that does the tint and touch-up‚Äù will be working, weather permitting, Tuesday‚Äôs and Thursday‚Äôs, after the turn of the new year.
My wife will return the loaner and pick up the Expedition between 1:45 and 5:00 p.m. today and retrieve the Expedition. 
 
As we have absolutely no control in this situation, we are disappointingly planning on returning to your dealership after January 1st, 2014, for work that should have been performed two weeks ago as we had agreed upon at the time of sale closure.  This presented an opportunity to go an entire week uninterrupted and your dealership would have had more than ample time to perform the work that was agreed upon, including the additional items that were discovered over the previous weeks following purchase. 
 
However, calls were never returned from your dealership to facilitate this.  You recently informed my wife that you had contacted her, left a voice mail(s) and had e-mailed as well.  It is difficult to assume that this was the way it transpired as we received neither of the forms of communication described.
 
You have had the vehicle for two whole working days and likely the majority of today, the third, and your dealership was still unable to produce results that would have concluded this situation in its entirety. 
 
I could continue to express my dissatisfaction and point out all of the discrepancies here, however, it appears to fall on deaf ears as there appears to be no honesty coming from your end.  The story line just continues to unfold with different avenues to the same ending.  Poor customer service.
 
I see no agreeable conclusion here that results in our satisfaction with our dealings with you, even after the final ‚ÄúWe Owe‚Äù has been performed after the new year.  It is unfortunate that this is the way that a long relationship with Ron Carter Dealerships will come to an end.  I assure you that there will be absolutely, no more business coming from my household or that of my family and friends in the form of referrals. 

Respectfully,

Todd,
We need to schedule the service for the 2011 Expedition.  Tara had called and left messages to facilitate this while I was out of the country, as we had agreed verbally to contact you and schedule a time to bring it in after December 8th.  Please respond as soon as possible as there are additional items that will need to be checked/inspected like the hood latch and AC controls.

Best Regards,

Wesley Rolan
---------

I was off yesterday and apologize for missing your call and email, but I have it now and getting it all handled. Tara is down the road in a loaner and have list on things to be done and will keep you posted on when it will be done and what was wrong. 
Thanks, Todd.
---------

Thanks.  I have two things...Tara forgot to mention the hood latch having issues, so it should be looked at.  Second, were you able to get the Alpine amplifier from under the seat in the Dodge as we had agreed?

Best Regards,

Wesley Rolan
---------

Got it being looked at as well and had the lot porter check on the amp and there was not one there to take out? Todd
----------

When we spoke about the amplifier, you told me that you would have it removed by your guys that do the accessories.  We agreed that you would have it removed and keep it at your desk until I was able to come and get it.  Tara did not remove it, she did not have the means to do so.  If it has been removed by someone in your organization and has been lost, this is a severe deficit in your customer service and is not an upright manner of doing business.  I expect that this will be addressed immediately, as your word should be as good as any ""We Owe"".

I got Martin Williamson the used car manager involved as he will be the one to have authority to replace or find out from my service department what happened to the amp as it was not there when my lot porter went to have it removed for me the following monday when the deal was funded from the bank and was able to take it out. The Expedition is still in my Ford service department with Joni Woodall and waiting to have her get the major stuff fixed so that I can get it detailed and the paint touched up. Todd

Joni just called and said that you are good to go on everything but the touch up and will have to schedule that when weather is better and not during the holiday season as the touch up guy will not be here all next week.

577,"January 03, 2014","I was sold a used vehicle that had been wrecked and it was not disclosed to me. I returned to the dealership and they said they would not buy it back and would only take it in on trade at their dealership. I had it for 8 months and they gave me 5,000.00 less than I paid for it. The staff advised me they didn't know and I didn't know so it wasn't their problem. The manager then advised me they made good money selling the car to me and laughed. The dealership would not return my calls and I had to drive back to the dealership to get the problem resolved. They then told me they would sell me a car at cost which they hassled me about until I seen the actual cost price and it was 1,300.00 less than what they quoted me. It was an all around mess and they didn't care. Think twice before using this dealership. My family has bought over 80 vehicles from this dealership and they acted as if they could care less.",2.4

581,"December 13, 2013","I had visited another Ford dealer prior to going into Ron Carter and saw a noticeable difference right away. They were courteous and treated me like my business was important without coming across as this being a act. The salesman Dominique was extremely helpful and courteous. He went out of his way to assist me in finding the exact truck I wanted for the best price. I put him through some trying times between looking for certain options and then having to change them due to input from what the wife wanted in conjunction with my wants. This went over three different trips to the dealer before we found what would fit our likes. Dominique even came in on his off day to discuss thing with my wife who could only meet at a certain time on a specific day due to work and we were needing a new vehicle soon. I would recommend this dealership to anyone in need of a vehicle for multiple reasons, but some of them are: courteousness, willing to assist, changing schedule to accommodate us and they have a huge selection of vehicles so anything you want is there.",4.8

Danny and Eric made me feel so very comfortable. They helped me every step of the way and I have to say I was probably quite a pain. But Danny Buitron was very patient with me and made me feel comfortable with the decision I made. I got a great deal and they were all super great.

590,"November 24, 2013","I sent a email for a quote to three dealerships for a 2013 GMC Sierra 1500 crew cab. Todd Price (Internet Sales Consultant) for Ron Carter was the first to reply. He sent me competitive quotes on three different trucks, which had me interested. After a few emails back and forth. I filled out an online credit app to get preapproved and set up an appointment. Last Monday the 18th I went in to talk to Mr. Price and look at some trucks. I actually arrived an hour earlier than the appointment time that I set, which did not bother Mr. Price. He was very courteous and friendly. ""Good People!"" I looked at a couple of the trucks that he sent me quotes on. Todd then said, he wanted me to look at a 2014 Chevy Silverado 1500 crew cab that he had on the lot. I was skeptical at first, thinking the 2013 GMC would have a nicer interior and the 2014 model would be way more expensive. Boy, was I wrong. I was so impressed with the price and quality of the 2014 Chevrolete Silverado, I bought it.

In ten years, I have been to Ron Carter two other times looking to buy a vehicle. This is the first time I have actually  felt  comfortable enough to make a purchase there. It is all thanks to the friendly and courteous help from Mr. Price, whom gave me an outstanding good deal on my new truck. I have to rate this as my best vehicle purchasing experience yet!",5.0
591,"November 22, 2013","I have purchased several vehicles in my life.  This was by far the best experience I've ever encountered at a car dealership.  Everyone was extremely nice and courteous.  They were extremely patient and answered all my questions and concerns.  Steven Slaughter is a great representative of Ron Carter.  He showed me several vehicles and helped us pick the right vehicle for us.  He was very mindful of our budget and didn't try to exceed it just to sell a car.  The general manger, Mr Shapiro, was also great.  We didn't spend a lot of time haggling. We quickly came to a deal everyone was happy with.  Mr Tedford in the finance department was equally courteous and friendly.  I really can't say enough great things about these guys. These guys are complete professionals and also treat you like family.  These guys have earned our future business.

592,"November 19, 2013","Full disclosure I chose Ron Carter because they had the truck I wanted already in their inventory.  I did an extreme amount research before buying my F250 and spoke with 5 other Houston area dealerships.  I can tell you to never go to Randall Reed Ford in Humble.  That stated, I drove from Kingwood and was the first customer in their door Monday morning.  At the door to greet me was the individual I'd read about on DealerRater - Robert Hernandez.  Robert had a very friendly approach and could tell I'd done my research and was going to make this easy for him, if he would in-turn reciprocate.  In a nutshell I was able to get the 2014 truck I'd wanted for the same as the 2013's other dealerships were trying to recommend.  Robert made the process easy and expedited the fulfillment of my order.

I had to complete my paperwork with Randy in Finance.  Very down to earth guy and extremely knowledgable.  They call him YODA because of his ability to convince people to do things.  (My guess anyway)- he has a smooth approach and likely will get you to buy an extended warranty or something else since he's been in the industry since 1985.  He's not going to pressure sale you, just the facts.  I liked having the facts.",4.8

I picked out a vehicle from their website and was immediately contacted by Koy. He was quick and ready to answer all my questions by email and phone and even took some pictures for me during a rain storm. When I made the trip down to make a deal, everything was set up and ready.

They were very fair on the price, and Ron explored every avenue to get us discounts and incentives to help get the price down even more. He was very knowledgeable about the Durango and it's features.

Mike also helped us to get a price that is below KBB price.  We came in expecting to get a used car, but because of the price, we were able to get a new car instead.  Very happy.

609,"September 05, 2013","I booked service online on a Thursday and the earliest appointment available was the following Wednesday. I received an Email thanking me for my booking and that I would receive a phone call from their service manager to discuss my service needs. I never received a call. I showed up 15 minutes early for my appointment schedule at 8:00am. The service representative wanted to charge $140 for computer diagnosis which I declined as I had received the diagnosis elsewhere for the need to replace a glow plug. I requested to be contacted for cost estimates on four separate service items, change a glow plug, fix the tire hoist, repair a door lock and provide a second key set. I never received any price estimates except $75 to inspect the door. By 11:30 am I had not received any calls, so I asked to speak with the service department, which didn't answer my call twice. Then I asked to speak directly with Steven Busch and was told that he was at lunch and no-one else could report on the status of my vehicle. At 1:00pm I returned to the Ron Cart dealership and the service department couldn't find Steven Busch, nor could they update me on my vehicle status. Despite asking several employees of Ron Carter, no-one seemed interested in finding Steven for me. Finally about 1:40pm Steven arrived and informed me that no work had been started on my car at all. He couldn't tell me when any work would start. I requested the return of my vehicle. I asked Steven what was the point of making an appointment if no work was going to get done for six hours. He informed me that the appointment is only to get time with a service manager to schedule the work in ""the queue"" and that the service managers have no control over when the work actually gets done. I told Steven that I would not ever be coming back to Ron Carter for anything ever again and left. Steven made an apology but it seemed that this was a common occurrence to have unhappy customers.

621,"July 27, 2013","Upon arriving at Ron Carter Chrysler-Jeep-Dodge, my fiance and I began walking around some of the Jeep Wranglers parked in front of the show room.  It was raining that day and we had forgot our umbrella at home.  However, sales associate Raymond Gonzales promptly greeted us carrying an umbrella.  There were many Jeeps to choose from, but our desired color/trim package was not readily available.  Raymond wasted no time finding our desired Jeep which just so happened to have been delivered from the factory moments before our arrival and was parked on an adjacent lot awaiting the check-in process.  The keys were not readily available to our soon-to-be jeep, but Raymond tracked down a set of keys to a Jeep matching ours exactly but in a different color.  After going for a thorough test drive, Raymond went over all of the features that particular Wrangler was equipped with.  We were interested in the Jeep to say the least, but we were not ready to commit to a purchasing decision so quickly.  Raymond suggested that we take the evening to think it over and in the meantime he would get the Jeep checked in, cleaned up, and ready to go by the following morning in the event that we decided to go through with the purchase.  After much thought, we decided to purchase the Jeep.  Just as promised, the Jeep was checked and washed upon our arrival the following morning.  We took our Jeep for a thorough test drive for the sake of principle, and Raymond went through the features once more.  The financial process was very quick and painless.  The whole process took just under 3 hours from start to finish which was completely acceptable in my opinion.  Raymond was an honest, fast working, and courteous sales associate.  He was in no way overbearing like a typical salesman.  He was a pleasure to work with and made our time at Ron Carter very enjoyable.

I allowed them to start the process on this. My salesperson helped me to get to the price that I wanted to pay and I was ready to sign the papers. After looking over the paperwork, I noticed that they increased the interest rate from 3.29% to 7.2% (with the same lender). I asked them if I could use my own pre-approved voucher (with the same lender); they refused to do this. Apparently, they made a percentage off of the APR rate from their financing department. Needless to say, I went to another dealership that used my financing. Buyers beware! Make sure you read the fine print before signing. ",3.6

Our salesman, Johnny, was extremely patient and helpful throughout the entire process. I had a lot of questions on various vehicles in various prices ranges. Due to our busy schedule and two young kids it took us over a month to decide on a vehicle. Similar to my experiences with past vehicle purchases, I visited a few other dealerships as well and found the other salesman I talked to less cooperative once I physically left their lots. Even after the sale Johnny's helpful attitude has not changed, I had a few quick questions on the Durango that he has helped me answer on same day I emailed him.

Management was extremely friendly and available to quickly address any non-standard questions I had.

To my surprise, I even had a pleasant (and quick) experience with the service department! There was a small air bubble in our dash that we told Johnny about. While they were processing our paperwork, it was looked at by the service department and within 5 minutes of identifying the problem I was taken directly to the service department who offered two solutions: 1) Fix it now (and delay taking the car home)....remember we have two very young kids. or 2) Bring it back before 5000 miles if the bubble hasn't disappeared and they'll replace the entire dash. The speed at which they addressed this and the fact that they didn't even remotely try to get out of doing it was great. Definitely different than most of my experiences with dealerships and issues with vehicles.

This has been the best car buying experience I've had. I certainly recommend Johnny and Ron Carter in Alvin.",5.0

650,"May 24, 2013","The entire staff at Ron Carter Ford, lead by salesman Paul Moreno, was VERY patient with my wife and I during our search for a new vehicle for the last year. From the very beginning, I gave them the understanding that I wasn't going to make a dealership visit until a baisc agreement was made. We negotiated soley via phone and email until we were ready to buy. They knew I didn't like going to a dealership until an agreement has been made. Paul and his staff were so confident, they patiently waited for about a year for me to shop around for the right deal. When we came to an agreement, I was able to drive right up to the front door of the dealership, throw Paul the keys to my trade-in, and begin the paperwork process of my new purchase IMMEDIATELY.


For a more non-political statement- Paul and his team cut through the BS and tells it like it is. This industry needs more salesman and women like this. Time is money. If you're looking for a straight forward purchase that can be negotiated quickly over the phone, email, or even text then I HIGLY reccomend Ron Carter Ford in Alvin, TX!!!

Because of your advertising as a Christian based business we chose Ron Carter in Alvin. 
We first met the Ford sales person, sorry I do not have his name, who was extremely professional and friendly, gave us full information on the Focus, and gave us each a test drive. Since we were also interested in the Dodge Dart he eagerly took us to the Dodge sales person, Johnny
Allen, who was equally friendly, knowledgeable, informative and helpful. After driving the Dart we chose to purchase it. Both sales persons 
then made extensive effort to find the car with all the options that we wanted.
We never felt pressured but were given honest, helpful information by the sales persons and the finance dept. 
Purchasing our car was a pleasant experience. We are commending you to our family and friends.
Many thanks, and we love our Dart.

663,"April 28, 2013","I had been shopping for a new vehicle for a few months and had been to several Chevrolet / GMC dealerships.  While the salesmen had been cordial, none had truly offered to help me find the vehicle I wanted if it was not already in their inventory.  Eric Helton went out of his way to help me.  I had very specific requirements for the vehicle that I wanted and he did everything he could to locate it but it was just not out there.  As it turned out, with his help and guidance, I decided to upgrade my choice and wound up buying a vehicle already on their lot.  Eric was never pushy. He was informative, kind and very pleasant to work with.  When I took delivery of my new car, he spent over an hour with me going over all the great things it can do.  He then took me to the Service Department and introduced me to the Service Manager, who also met me with a great smile and warm handshake.

Eric has followed-up with me already to see if I have any questions or concerns.  I not only feel like he was my salesman, but I consider him a new friend!  My son purchased his new vehicle from Eric shortly before I bought mine and I will recommend him to anyone!

When I arrived, he had already located several vehicles for me to choose from and exactly the price points we had talked about.  

I also got a 4 inch Lift Kit Mopar with the Wheels and Tires I specified. I wanted custom leather, which they let me choose. I worked with their AfterMarket Department. Everything was included in the Factory Jeep Warranty.  I had a 2 inch Lift Kit on my last Jeep and really wanted a 4 inch Lift Kit.   One of the reasons that I chose Ron Carter, is that they warranty a 4 inch lift 100 percent.  Some of the other dealers in the Houston area will only go as high as a 2 or 3 without voiding your original warranty.

Bill Jordan at Ron Carter worked extremely hard to get me everything I wanted with a fantastic price, good service, and was very easy going.
He has been with the Company for many years.  This is great dealership and worth the drive. You will definitely save money going to Ron Carter as they are willing to do their very best on the price for you.

I did get several quotes before visiting Ron Carter and none of them came even close to the price and service I received at Ron Carter Jeep.

I really appreciate everything.

I drove the 40 miles from Baytown to Alvin and after a pleasant and very painless experience, drove home with my new Chrysler Town & Country van.

When I 1st looked online for a new truck, of course at Ron Carter, because it is very close to home, within minutes I was contacted by Mr. Moreno.  He sent me a quote right then.  This is was brought me into the dealership, it was very reasonable. Once my Husband and I got to the dealership, Paul wasn't there, but we spoke to Mike Owens.  He was very helpful as well.  He gave us some figures on a truck and we went home to discuss the deal.  The next week were came back with our trade in, and Paul was able to give us an acceptable trade allowance and we found a truck that we really liked and he made it possible for us to work into our budget.  

I will never buy a vehicle anywhere else.  I feel very comfortable at Ron Carter.  We highly recommend Ron Carter and Mr. Moreno and Mr. Owens, to all of our friends and family.  They gave us 100% in service and quality time.  I fully intend to get all my service done there as well.

Dennis is a first rate sales person, friendly, easy to deal with, no excuses... just I'll take care of it!!
The dealership was first rate in standing by Dennis, when he went out of his way to satisfy me, and honor the deal.

752,"September 17, 2012","I have to explain my ratings above.  They come in two parts.  Our sales person, Paul Moreno was fantastic!  Ironically, right before a 2 plus hour bad experience at another Ford dealership, Paul gave us their best price on the phone in less than 2 minutes.  A price that never waivered and was a good deal. When we arrived at the dealership the truck was ready to go and we were done with everything in 45 minutes.  

It was a great experience from that standpoint and we'll definitely go back to Ron Carter for future purchases.

The reason why I listed my overall experience was just good is because we felt mislead by the finance person, Mark who persuaded us buy an extended warranty.  When we asked him what the cost of the warranty was he never directly answered us (I know it should of been our first clue).  After reviewing the paperwork we realized how much the warranty was and called them back.  Mike in the Finance department was kind enough to cancel the warranty without any trouble.

Overall,  dealing with Ron Carter was great and there was never any pressure.  I highly recommend the dealership (but definitely keep an eye out during the signing, make sure you know exactly what everything is, make them slow down).",4.6

From the outset, Mr. Gilbreath sowed us a great deal of patience with our many questions; his knowledge of the many vehicles was impressive; and his many courtesies to my wife and me were refreshing in this modern world.

In addition, as we moved on closing a deal on our GMC Terrain, Mr. Gilbreath did his best to see that we received a company discount.  Finally, when we mentioned that we would be paying for our GMC by breaking a bank certificate of deposit, he showed how we could save several hundred dollars in penalties by using the Wells Fargo payment plan for a few months until the CD becomes due in a few months.

When the paper work was done, Mr. Gilbreath took us to the service department to introduce us to Mr. Jason Poole, who made us feel welcome to his department.

In summary, we left the Ron Carter dealership with our new GMC and a healthy appreciation for the professional treatments we received.

I bought a Harley F150 last year from ""Tony G"" and got a great deal and great dealer support.

So, this year when I wanted to purchase a Raptor F150, I knew that ""Tony G"" and Ron Carter Ford was the only dealership I needed to visit for the best deal and service in Texas.

When the Raptor arrived, everything went perfectly. They put it through make ready and it was gleaming so brightly inside and out!!!  Just beautiful...!!

Set up of all the systems went easily and quickly. The Sync system is fascinating.

And when I wanted to add some extra accessaries at the very last...they took care of it right away....I didn't even have to wait in line!!  

Got a great deal on some extra lighting, window tint and LoJack....installation went seamlessly and looks like it came from the factory....you'd never know it was added at the dealership.

So, if you want the best deal, service and dealer support....go to Ron Carter in Alvin!!

Don't waste your time with any other dealership. ",5.0
800,"June 14, 2012","My wife and I visited Ron Carter on 6-7-12 looking at the new Ram Trucks.  We showed up at 9am and by 10:30 we had already found my truck, went for a test drive, and finished the negotiations in time to make it to my wife's ultrasound appointment in Houston at 11:15.  Normally it takes me at least a week and 10 dealerships to purchase a new vehicle at the price I'm looking for. However, at Ron Carter it was a different experience than what I've had with other dealerships.  They were very aggressive with their offers on my trade-in and the new vehicle FROM THE START. At other dealerships you will experience your sales person walking to the back 8 or 9 times (for 10-20 minutes) and 9 times out of 10 you still won't have the deal you want.  On Eric's only trip out he came back with the sales manager and we had the deal I was looking for within 5-10 minutes. I called them on my way back from the appointment in Houston to let them know we were on the way, and that we were having a BOY!  When we arrived back at the dealership my truck was parked out front with a few more options than what it had originally (Blue Balloons, Congrats it's a Boy banner, and a few baby gifts inside).  The papers were ready and waiting for us inside and we were driving off in no time.

The only down side for me is the fact that I like to negotiate and I really didn't get the chance to at Ron Carter, but I'm definitely not complaining. 

Excellent Selection, friendly staff, and no hassle!  Ron Carter will certainly be my first choice again next time!  ",5.0

I was actually on my way to pick up a used BMW I verbally committed to buying when I decided to at least go see Jimmy and check out the new Chevy's. He spent time with me telling me the latest and greatest 'new' stuff that has been added since I bought my last truck from him. There was ZERO pressure and he was on point with me with his thoughts to pros and cons to both the truck I was looking at the BMW I described to him that I was going to buy. He asked if I at least wanted to look at what kind of deal he could put together for me before I left to pick up my car and I said sure, why not. Well Jimmy worked his magic, put a very fair deal in front of me and told me to at least think about it. 

Well I did think about it.....for about 10 mins. I asked him to let me take the truck out for a spin and he said Let's go! Well I actually just got through washing and loving on my 1 week old truck! Man it's beautiful and Jimmy made the deal as easy as pie! No crazy first time offers, no slick talk, just a honest very competitive deal. I research the prices and vehicles like crazy on the internet and Jimmy was right where I thought was perfectly fair.

Jimmy is just one of the good guys. He's straight, honest, and he knows his trucks. There isn't any games or gimmicks with him. He's upfront about making the deal a win/win for everybody.

All of the personnel I & later my wife & son met @ Ron Carter throughout our dealings were extremely curtious & friendly & again I do not give my thumbs-up unless it is truely warranted! This was the 2nd time I had purchased a new auto from Ron Carter! 1st time was in 1995! It was a Pontiac Grand Prix, which we kept until 2000, @ which time we traded it in on a 2000 Grand Prix @ Gay Pontiac!

Even though I was pressed for time due to my schedule, he managed to get everything done in 1 day. I am very impressed with the amount of time and care he devoted to making sure I got my ecoboost f-150. At work people ask me what I drive now. I tell them Jason Gabriel helped me buy an f-150, and I would never drive any other vehicle. If you think of Ford as old and boring...go drive a new ford...you may be surprised. The sheer amount of comfort and electronic tools they install standard on these trucks is staggering. The famed dodge horsepower is laughable now due to the v-6 ecoboost. In short, Jason...thank you!

856,"February 07, 2012","I have spent the majority of my working life in sales, and/or customer service, so I am much more apt to write positive reviews, rather than complaints.  I am sorry to say that I cannot do so in this case, but I will start my review with the positives. 

Leon Lundy is far above average as a sales consultant, and everyone at the dealership pleasant.  My purchase went smoothly, and I was back home with my new Chevrolet Cruze in about 4 hours.

That is when I found that there was a situation that I needed to address with Leon, so I called him that same afternoon.  I had driven, and worked the deal on one vehicle, then decided to change what I thought to be the color of the vehicle.  I had looked at the vehicle (same model) I purchased but had not driven it, or seen the window sticker, as it was not on the window, or visible from the outside of the car. When I arrived home, and found the window sticker in the glove box I realized there was more than just a change of color, as this vehicle was $400-500 less than the one we had worked the numbers on originally.  

Though I didn't know if anything could be done, I felt I was treated unfairly, and I brought this matter to the attention of Leon. He replied that he would check it out, but that was over two weeks ago, and I have not heard from him except for the generic e-mails sent out to all those who purchase vehicles.

After not hearing from Leon for a week, I wrote a letter to the General Manager explaining my displeasure.  That was 11 days ago, and there has been no response from anyone at Ron Carter.

I don't know that anything could have been done to resolve my issue, but I fully expected a response from someone. No matter how good the sales experience was for me,there is no way that I can recommend a dealership with so little regard for the satisfaction of their customers.

Finally heard from a sales manager, over three weeks after I initially brought my complaint to the salesman, and over two weeks after writing the general manager.
Seems there should have been an addendum with the window sticker for tinting windows, even though the original window sticker says the vehicle is equipped with Solar Ray Light Tinted windows?  The sales managers call and explanation, did not change my opinion of the dealership.

Make and model were not very important. Kyle searched his lots and called me with the information about a very nice 2007 F-150. He provided an excellent price on an exceptionally nice truck that was ideal for my son. My son and I could not be happier with the purchase. This is my family's second purchase from the Ron Carter group. With this level of service I plan to be a customer for a very long time. - I continue to be impressed with their hassle free, no pressure style of doing business.

The lack of follow through was probably partly explained by the purchase occurring the week before Christmas, 2011 but I had to make repeated phone calls and then basically just showed up at the dealership in order to get the work started.

887,"December 21, 2011","Ron Carter was the 4th dealership I went to.  I had already test driven the car I wanted.  And I had already known I wanted to place an order before I walked on a dealer's lot, because I had done research on the internet before coming in, and knew exactly what I wanted and what all the dealers had.  The first dealers still tried to sell me a car on the lot, after trying to ""fit"" me into something that was not quite what my ""build-your-own"" order looked like.  When that didn‚Äôt' work, they wanted to search around the state to find me the right car.  

So I called Ron Carter internet sales (Jack) and he said they could order it for me, no problem.  We made a tentative agreement on price over the phone.  Later in the week, I came to the lot with my build sheet, but it was Jack's day off.  So I happened on a manager (Kent} and he did exactly as I requested.  This time when I said I wanted to order a vehicle, he also said ""yes"", took my name and number, and made copies of my build sheet, and said ""okay, we'll get that ordered for you, and I'll have [Jack] call you back with your order information"".

And that's exactly what happened.  Jack called me back with the information.  It took a few weeks for the car to be built and shipped, but it came in under the time I was quoted, and it was exactly like I ordered.  Jack kept me informed as to the progress, and then called me when it finally came in.  We arranged window tinting, finalized the paper work and I signed on the dotted line, and I was out of there.

Very easy.  No fluff or BS.  No high pressure.  Nothing but strait talk.  And probably the smoothest car buying experience I've ever had.  Thank you Jack and Kent, and Ron Carter dealership.

914,"October 27, 2011","I did shop around to 4 other dealership and had heard good things in the community about Ron Carter. I shopped at DeMontrand and Sand Dollar and Norma Frede all local to my location. Mr. Easterling was receptive and listened to what I wanted.  He understood I was looking for something different. He took me to exactly what I was looking for on the lot.  We then began to discuss options and he spent alot of time with me and my significant other looking over all the options.  He was just as excited about the car as I was.  So we finally found the car I wanted and it had to be brought in from another dealership. He kept me informed with every detail going on with the car until it arrived.  Meaning they had to trade a car for it and get it there. He let me know at all times what was going on and had the car displayed right in front of the front door when I arrived.  My work schedule is hectic and he did take his time to make sure I understood all the gadgets in the car and of course helped me with On Star until way after the dealership was closing. When it came down to finance Mr MiChalk took his time looking to make sure he could get me the best rate possible and they took their time to explain all the options the dealership offered.  My experience was fantastic.  I am very excited about the car and the service was excellent. I had the option to use another dealership when they did not have the exact car I wanted on the lot. Mr Easterling told me point blank ""it is my job to find you just what you want and I wont stop looking until i do.""  I appreciated his honesty and his integrity during this process.  I have already recommended him to a friend who is also interested in a camaro.  Overall, great experience.  I will use and recommend this dealership in the future.",5.0

I had been shopping for new trucks for about 2 weeks only to find that I didn't like the hassle and the dealings with all of the sales people who were basically looking out for themselves and not me, the customer!!  I talked to the people at my credit union who provided my financing, and they gave me a name.  &quot;American Bob&quot;..  I got his number and called him and it was his day off.  He looked around and called me back and told me he had something for me.  I had heard this before, but I went ahead and took the trip down to Alvin to check it out.  Out of the last few times I had bought a new vehicle, this was by far the best buying experience I have had.  He was layed back, no pressure, took me right to the vehicle that I had requested.  NO HASSLE AT ALL.  When I had that &quot;I'm NOT SURE LOOK&quot;, he simply let me think about it on my own.  We looked at serveral different ways I could do this and he simply gave me advice, but did not pressure me either way at all.  I plan from here on out to only deal with Ron Carter and American Bob when anyone in my family is in the market for a new vehicle.  To American Bob, I thank you for your expertise, and wish you well.  THANKS!!!",5.0

Our salesman was awesome (Bill S. Jordan) he met us as we walked up and asked what we were looking for. Never once tried to push us to anything other than we were looking for. He was very knowlagable of his product and this made it seem easy for him to explain everything needed to know.

923,"October 03, 2011","Our experience with this dealership was fantistic. However, the Salesman, Don L. Wolfe was awesome as well as exceptional. We were referred to Mr. Wolfe, had never met him but heard so many great things about him. We found Mr. Wolfe to definitely be a people's person, great personality, he not only heard our situation but he listened and he delivered, he made it happen. We left with a vehicle that had never crossed our mind, but really works great for us, we are loving this vehicle. Mr. Wolfe walked us thru all of the steps & the process, we gained knowledge & understanding of the whole picture in credit readings, car buying & what we had to do for the future. He put us on the right track with the situation that we were in, now we can regain & stay that way.

During our visit Mr. Wolfe had a sense of humor, answered any questions that we did not understand, no question was a dumb question, he was very detailed oriented, very professional, and have to say very sharp. We not only brought a vehicle, but we also left very educated in what we needed, we were totally impressed, grateful & happy with the whole experience & car buying visit. Mr. Don Wolfe is what every person need when buying a vehicle, whether new, used, credit problems, credit ratings, or whatever their situation may be. With him he understands that people are not a number, they are human beings and with this being said, he's not only in the business for commission, we can clearly see that he wants to help people & to help make the need come true, he understands that all a person need is a chance and that is what he brought to the table along with a whole lot of value. Thank you Mr. Wolfe.  The Sparrow family.",4.8

I was in there alone with four young children and they actually enjoyed watching movies and playing in the play room. I was happy with the sale price of the van I purchased. After doing weeks of research, I was suprised to find such a deal on a van at a dealership, but I did at Ron Carter Toyota.

Additionally I have ordered a set of carpet floor mats and he is handling this for me too. I can call him virtually anytime and get in touch with him, even on his day off.

Another thing I am going to do is have my toolbox sprayed the same as my p.u.bed...he has been helpful in this regard too.

Lastly, I have not been pyrchasing my vehicles ( My business partner served this function for the last 15 years) and was pleased to find Gary and the staff ( financing department) very professional. I came away with a feeling of dealing with an honest person.

This was absolutely the very first that we actually enjoyed the entire experience.  There was no game playing.  Just a fair deal and honesty and done in reasonable time.  Recently, GM advised us that the cruze was no longer towable four wheels down.  This was the reason we chose the Cruze to begin with.  Needless to say, we were very unhappy with GM.  We went to Chris who put us in touch with an owner of the dealership, Allen Hall.  They worked with GM and with a good deal of effort on their part and my wife's part, a fair arrangement was made to get us in a vehicle that could be towed.  Chris, Allen and the dealership were great through the entire ordeal.  They made it work, because the people at GM didn't have a clue.",4.8

I was told I would get between $7,000. - $8,0000. for my trade in and was given $6,000.

My wife & I were helping my mother-in-law in purchasing a new car for her and Jimmy was the man to get the job done. Originally we were there to purchase a used Honda, but once my mother-in-law saw the new Chevy Cruze, she was in love with it. Jimmy is a smart man and had not started the paperwork on the Honda because he knew we weren't 100% sure on the Honda, so when we decided on a different car once we got there, there was no problems getting started. He was very knowledgeable on the Chevy Cruze and went above and beyond the call of duty to explain all the gadgets that the car has to my mother-in-law and us. He even helped us in conducting the On-Star introduction call, which was very helpful. While we were getting all the paperwork situated, Jimmy filled the car up and had it washed for us. Overall he made our experience very pleasant, and not only was he very knowledgeable in his job, but he was super friendly and treated my family & I with great hospitality by offering us drinks and seats as soon as we got there.

We agreed on a purchase price and never once did they try to discuss payments, as most dealerships do. When we picked up our new Tahoe they set up the bluetooth, onstar, and introduced us to the service manager so we could set up futre visits.

I ended up purchasing a one-year-old G6 for a great price. They even gave me a good price for my trade-in. My only complaint was that I stated at the start that I already had financing from my credit union and the dealership applied for a loan without my permission to two different companies. They (and the credit bureaus) say that it won't affect my credit score because of some provision that lumps all auto or mortgage applications together as one as long as they occur within a certain amount of time.  So it's not going to affect me in the long-term, but it sure did upset me at first when I got letters in the mail from banks I'd never heard of saying my loan request had been denied. I would still recommend this place though, just make sure if you've already got financing that you just flat out REFUSE to give them your social security number  :-)",4.0
