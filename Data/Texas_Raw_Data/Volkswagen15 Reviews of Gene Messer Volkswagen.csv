0,"August 09, 2019","One of the oddest car buying experiences I've had honestly. The staff was very quick to reach out to me after my inquiry on one of the vehicles in the lot. I provided details on my car back in a text message and then never heard back on what the trade-in value would be. Had I not spent the last few weeks doing research on the exact vehicle I wanted, I probably would not have come in. 

The first odd thing, when I pulled up to the dealership, no one came out and asked me if I needed help with anything. Honestly, I don't mind not being bombarded by salesmen, but I was surprised. So, neither good nor bad there. When I walked into the dealership it was a bit of an odd interchange between the front staff and salesman. I explained why I was there, and the salesman said he could take me to look at the truck but he had an appointment in a few minutes. We went out and looked at the truck, and he didn't really even say a word about it. He just assumed I was going to buy it. Again, a little odd, and I was kinda hoping at this point there was a salesman who could tell me anything about the car or at least try to. 

He passed me off to another salesman. We quickly went on a test drive, and again, I was basically just trying to figure out everything in the vehicle myself. Now, this was a Ford truck, so I understand the staff may not be as familiar with it. But, I expected at least a little bit of information about the truck. Nothing. Now, I had gotten there almost as early as they opened up, around 9:15am, because I didn't want to spend my entire day buying a car. Well, I had to wait for a manager to get out of his meeting to get an offer. I used the USAA Car buying service, and the sales manager had to go back a couple times to check the price because that's not what he had. I had the printout and could provide the price directly from USAA's app. He eventually gave me the price, but there is apparently a disconnect there and wanted to haggle, even though they advertise a ""no-haggle"" policy. He also completely ignored everything I mentioned about the trade-in value. I guess no haggle means they want to screw you out of any money and don't want to hear any complaints. I was also told that the system could only handle one sale at a time, which is another reason I had to wait. Yes, I was told it was being upgraded to handle six sales. Not even sure what to say to that.

All of the paperwork I signed was not very well explained, but I was probably there for about 3 hours now so I didn't question too much. It was then on to finance. Before even speaking to anyone, I was just told that I need to have my bank/credit union to send the dealership my ""drafting paperwork."" No one explained what that was, just expected me to contact them and understand what to do. My bank explained most of it to me and I was working on completing the loan when I went to the finance manager's office. The first thing he asked was if I had sent the draft paperwork yet. I told him I was working on it and he seemed a little impatient. ""Ok, just let me know when you send it."" Ok... thanks... will do. No one even asked me if I was making a down payment and I had to stop him before going forward with the paperwork to do so. I then had to call my bank a couple times to get my daily limit changed. Again, he seemed a little impatient. He really didn't explain any of the paperwork, again.  And I walked out of there with a copy of about 3 pages of the 20 pages he went through. He basically just said, ""ok, you're done."" And that was it. Okay... great?

I walked out and waited for probably another hour before the new truck I had bought had come out from getting cleaned. What took so long? And why didn't they start earlier? As I was sitting there waiting for my truck to appear out of somewhere, my salesman was just sitting outside on the lot looking at a couple of cars. He came in once and mentioned that the detail guys may have taken a lunch break and he didn't know what was taking so long. Then he walked back out. I'm a very patient person, but it was now 1:30pm, over 4 hours after I arrived, and no one said a word to me for the next 20-30 mins. Finally, thank God, my truck appeared and I was very happy to get out of there. 

I was told my registration plates would ""probably"" be mailed to me in a few weeks. Great, instilling more confidence in this dealership. I got a call yesterday that I had to go down to the DMV to complete the titling and registration of my truck. I've never heard of anything like that. I can't believe the dealership was unable to even complete this portion correctly. 

It has been 3 weeks now, and to this day my loan is still not approved at my bank because the finance manager is incompetent. He has not sent the proper documentation to finalize the loan. I contacted the bank and they they hadn't received any paperwork. When I called him, he stated he had sent the paperwork almost a week after the sale was complete and to call my bank. I received another call from my bank stating one document was missing and the other was not legible. If my loan goes through properly prior to the expiration of the approval date range, I will be amazed.

And then finally, I received an email from Danilo DeLeon, the General Manager, about my online inquiry, after I had already bought the truck asking if everything was handled to my satisfaction. I provided him with the same information listed above, and have not received any reply back almost 3 weeks later.

Bottom line, avoid this dealership like the plague. It's run by incompetent neanderthals.",1.0
1,"July 23, 2019","Customer service is terrible. The receptionist had to track down a salesman when we walked in the door. Communication was terrible, everything was met with “I don’t know, that’s not my department.” Since we were working on financing outside of the dealership it took a few days to finally purchase a vehicle. When we went to look at the 2018 vehicle we eventually purchased the check engine light was on, but we were assured it had been taken care of and that  there were no more issues, we were foolish enough to trust them since the light was off and we hadn’t noticed any issues driving it. 3 days later the light was back on. 4 days after purchasing we took it to the Dodge dealership since it’s still under warranty and are now being told there is metal in the engine and depending on the severity of it we may need a whole new motor. During the process we also were told that if we had anymore issues to take it to Dodge since it was under warranty and they would be the ones who could really help us. We also dealt with a really rude pushy finance person that was completely annoyed and irritated that we wouldn’t take the higher interest rate he was offering and also informed us that we were required to purchase an extended warranty to protect their interests.  After emailing their general manager I was told he was new there for only about a week. Now suddenly today he’s been moved to another one of their dealerships and can no longer help me, but my information has been passed along. They also made a big deal that they couldn’t get us a second key fob because it was a couple hundred dollars and to expensive.... this was while I was purchasing a 19,000 vehicle from them with an extremely large down payment and outside financing.

2,"June 29, 2019","As a woman it can be intimidating to shop for a car alone so I was not looking forward to shopping. However, after seeing their reviews I decided to start my search at gene messer VW. Well, It was my first and last stop. From the moment I walked in I was greeted warmly and met with Edmond who was extremely helpful. He was was kind and made me feel at ease immediately. Also, the manager who greeted me (forgot his name) was attentive and made me feel like a valued customer. I will do all my service for my Jetta and recommend them to anyone looking for a new vehicle.

3,"February 25, 2018","Called and talked to sales that I wanted to by a truck they had listed on their website.  The sales man told me the price was over two times the listed price. I asked to speak to a manager. Talked to the manager and he told me that those prices on their website sometimes are wrong and he would not sale me the truck for that price. 
Buyer be ware. These guys are not truthful to get you to come into there lot. ",1.0
