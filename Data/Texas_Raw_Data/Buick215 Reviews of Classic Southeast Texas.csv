Our recent purchase of the Chevrolet Traverse was perfect for me because I drove a Lincoln Navigator for 12 years and it was hard letting it go. But after a few days I could enjoy my new baby. ,5.0

14,"February 05, 2020","My wife and I were greeted at the front door by a real nice Salesman Josh Ozio.  We explained to him we were there to speak with Rob Rogers and look at a Arcadia Denali that we looked at on Sunday.  Josh asked us what unit we wanted to look at and he gathered the keys.  We loaded up in the golf cart to drive through the lot to the Arcadia.  He unlocked the unit and started it for us.  He began by sitting my wife in the drivers seat and started to walk her through the different options this unit had to offer.  We then took the unit for a test drive and Josh continued to show us options that this unit had and what it could do.  We were impressed with the unit and also impressed with Josh's knowledge of the product.  We arrived back at the dealership and began the negotiation for this unit along with our trade in.  Rob was not available at that time, but did call me and let me know that there was a good Team on site and they would be able to help us.  Between Josh and Derek, we were able to come to an agreement that was fair to both parties.  

This was a very painless & pleasant process from the beginning.  The complete Team @ Classic made us feel welcomed.  Josh, Dererk, Conrad, and Tambi were all very helpful and professional.

I have had the opportunity to reach back out to Josh and Tambi after the sale for different things.  They both have responded quickly and provided the needed help.

This is our first purchase from the Classic Team and we will be back for future purchases.",5.0

19,"December 09, 2019","Dealership was a great buying experience.   The sales manager, Kevin Simien has always been a great manager and team leader who I have dealt with for many years.

He definitely set the bar high for anyone who is in the business of selling vehicles.  Thanks Bruce!   ",5.0
20,"December 06, 2019","Albert Saunders was a great salesman.  He made the buying experience professional, fast and knew his inventory.  I was planning to go to Spring, TX for a vehicle but his deal was great I did not need to travel.

27,"October 13, 2019","My wife and I had a great experience with Classic SETX buying a Demo ‘19 Suburban.  Scott Danks, The Deal Dr., was a fantastic, low pressure salesman who made sure we were comfortable and welcome.  The negotiation process was quick and amicable.  I think both parties got what they wanted out of the deal.  The vehicle is in great shape with only minor blemishes and Classic sold us the unit at a heavily discounted price with a full manufacturer warranty.  Everyone involved from Dr. Scott all the way to Ronnie, the finance guy, won us over.  Thanks for the awesome evening and the great deal!",5.0
28,"September 24, 2019","I cannot say enough about this Dealership.  Both Classic Chevrolet, and especially Fletcher and Eric on the Classic Kia side have made buying my vehicles very pleasurable.  I have bought multiple cars from this dealership since I have lived in the area and as long as I live here I will not go anywhere else.  These people seem so honest and truly care about your needs.  Since I didn’t have Rental on my insurance policy those 2 guys didn’t hesitate to loan me the car I wanted to buy after Imelda until my Insurance company could come and inspect my flooded vehicle and pay it off.  I appreciate them so much for their kindness, as now I can get back and forth to work with no worries!!  I recommend everyone I come in contact with to buy all their vehicles at Classic Beaumont!!  They seem like family to me!!  And service after the sale is awesome!!  I love these guys!!!  ?? ",5.0
29,"September 05, 2019",Buying a car from Will was the easiest and most enjoyable car buying experience I have ever had. He made sure I got everything I wanted within my price range. He even set up all my extras in my new car!,5.0
30,"September 04, 2019","Went to pick up a truck on a Wednesday. I was told I could get a better deal on a Demo truck and it would be ready the next day. Next day, check in hand, no truck and the vehicle is loaned out to a customer. Then I'm told its guaranteed to be there Friday, and no vehicle Friday PLUS it needs to be driven 500 more miles to be eligible for the price. Nicholas Hunter tells me he wont be mad if I go somewhere else. 

 So... I go to Bayway Chevrolet and BAM! talked to them on the phone before heading out and they got me the same truck, better color, NEW, and  same price that day! Best decision. Thank you Bayway Chevrolet! and thanks ""Niq"" Hunter for encouraging me to go else where.",1.8
31,"June 30, 2019",Wanted to say how great my experience was at Classic GMC with Jordon Dowers.  He worked with me patiently to find the best SUV for my husband who recently had a hip replacement and needed a higher vehicle with max leg room to get in.  We measured every SUV on the lot and finally settled on a new 2019 Acadia.  Total process went smoothly start to finish with a final shout out to Kenny in financing who made the paperwork painless.  Glad to say Hubby loves it and drove it today and is looking forward to this great vehicle.,4.6

94,"December 11, 2016","Don Edwards of Classic Chevrolet, Cadillac, Buick, GMC, Kia of Beaumont Texas lives up to Classic’s  motto, “Strive for perfection in order to achieve excellence”. For a year from Denver CO, I had been looking in a particular narrow range for an older small pickup, not in Classic’s brand lines. In November, the internet flagged one. I contacted Don, Classic Sales Consultant, before pictures or shop inspection were available. Given the Gulf Coast climate, I was concerned about rust. Overnight, Don emailed 3 detail, HD photos of the undercarriage plus 2 photos of the rest of the vehicle. Later personal inspection verified an exceptional, well-kept and equipped truck. I made a fair offer out-the-door for what I saw, which Classic accepted regardless of subsequent offers -- subject to my prompt follow up! I flew from DEN to Beaumont, found the vehicle to be clean, sound, in excellent condition as advertised, and drove to Denver. All fluids, mechanicals, and documents were prepped for travel, and Classic provided a cracked windshield replacement voucher, which they had not been able to do in the short time before delivery – without my having to ask! So Kudoes to Classic, Don Edwards, the new-to-me trucklet, and the 1400 mile home-going tourist trip it provided! ",5.0
95,"November 20, 2016","They kept my car car from Thursday to Saturday just to change a dead battery. I went on Friday to take my car and they lied and said it would not start or take a jump, something else was wrong. When I returned on Saturday with a battery to take my car it was surprisingly fixed. The paperwork showed dead battery which I was told it was not the battery. Then they never called me when my vehicle arrived by roadside assistant to get my info and my car was entered under a strange woman name I didn't even know. After that got straight they could not find my keys. Service manager service is just as bad as the service advisors. He completed my paperwork and never showed any concern about me being unsatisfied and never apologized or anything. He just made excuses about everything and didn't care to hear my concern. ",1.0

I don't think you can ask for any better service than what Classic Southeast Texas provided.

No warning lights ever came on but the occurrences were becoming more frequent. I was told it was motor mounts. Replaced all four! Not the problem!!! Service manager repaired what he thought was the problem. Not!  Mike and Misty tried. Very disappointed that without the computer diagnosis the service department is operating blind and is of no use in solving Chevy problems. My 2007 Equinox that I adore is dying slowly. I must put it out of its misery, but not with another car from Classic😤",3.3
98,"September 14, 2016",I brought in a Silverado 2500HD Duramax Diesel that stalled while driving and failed to re-start. The Service center could not get the truck into the schedule for about 36 hours but after that the problems were diagnosed quickly. The problem ended up being covered under the manufacturers warranty and this service center quickly obtained all of the parts and completed the work in quick fashion. They were easy to work with and called frequently with updates once the repairs began.,3.6
99,"August 22, 2016","Took my car in for a rattling noise in the engine.  I was lectured by Diane in service because her computer gave me the wrong time.  Took them 5 days before they even looked at it.  I was told for weeks ""it will be ready tomorrow"".  They returned it to me and the noise was far worse than when I brought it and they charged me for an oil change because the warranty work needed the oil drained from the motor to be done....  They also broke the motor on my seat, broke my shifter and the porter couldn't find reverse so hit the car in front of it and then stalled the car 3 times just pulling it 100ft around.  Took it back because they failed to fix it and again more than a month of being told ""it will be ready tomorrow.""  Car still wasn't fixed.  They drained the oil, but I found there was no oil in the engine.  Motor is now blown but they are saying it's not their problem.  They refused to pay for the rental because the rental company didn't rent me a GM vehicle.  I tried to talk to the service manager Mike - he lied to me multiple times.  Made me drive in several times only to tell me he didn't have things ready for me.  I've tried to talk to the head of the dealership who told me it was my fault that I didn't take care of my care despite showing all of my receipts for all maintenance work completed on time.  My motor blew in Lake Charkes but I wanted Classic to fix it since it was right after they worked on it -  the dealership manager Jason told me ""that's just lazy.  You need to take it to a dealership in Lake Charles since that's where it broke down.""  I've tried to go through GM - no help.  Now the dealership in Lake Charles won't even touch it, it's so damaged.  I have had GM trying to get the district manager to call me for the last few weeks, won't even return my call.  Poor work and no recourse for the damage they cause.",1.0
100,"July 29, 2016","Tanya was my Service Rep. She kept me informed, dealt with my rental car return to Hertz, and made sure my Tahoe front window sunshield was kept in the window to prevent a third cracked dashboard. Excellent service representative! I purchased my 2010 Tahoe 4x4 here new. I have had several different advisors throughout the 6 years of ownership. Most should take lessons from Tanya on paying attention to detail. The parts guys have always done a fine job for me. The service manager has intervened on my behalf with GM to make an out-of-warranty repair much less expensive than originally quoted. I have been driven home and to the rental agency by the Classic shuttle with little notice to them. All in all, I tend to overlook small problems due to their rapid growth. My last three visits were all money-savers and work was done well.",4.8
101,"July 08, 2016","Contacted service this morning about oil change. Was told I have to make appt...ok. was told next time was next Wednesday..... really? Four calendar days out for an oil change? So I scheduled an appointment for an oil change. Then, Diana tells me that I don't need my oil changed because it is not less thank 20% and was very abrasive about it insisting that i give a valid reason so that she can document for cheverolet. Little does Diana know, but I travel a lot and don't have the luxury of having scheduled oil change appointments four days in advance for the dealerships convenience. I have never heard of a service company who makes it so hard to recieve service. Made it out like they were doing me a favor. Turned a routine oil change into being harder than enlisting into army. Oh ... I called granger chevrolet. ... they recommend getting oil changes at 40%.  Shouldn't chevrolet have constant protocol for this? JK chevrolet even would fit me in today. Bottom line is I spent 40000 with classic chevrolet last month and have a very bad first impression of Diana and the service department. Philpott Ford provided excellent customer service on my last truck and was happy and grateful to do it.",1.0
102,"June 16, 2016","Classic has always been a horrible experience. This time my car has sat there for 3 weeks untouched while they lied to my insurance company and me saying that it was being worked on. I am actually having to tow it to another shop 

They also are trying to charge me for something they did to a loaner vehicle they gave me while making repairs agreed upon on purchasing my vehicle, a month an a half later!

Lastly, they sold me a vehicle with a spare key unprogrammed. During the purchase they told me just to not use the spare, a week later I found out it wasn't programmed! They didn't want me to know that until I signed the dotted line. Aaron promised me a full tank, which didn't happen, as well as touch up paint, which didn't happen either. If you absolutely must deal with these people, get EVERYTHING in writing.

 I don't know how they get off treating customers so badly and wouldn't wish them upon my worst enemy.",1.2

108,"September 03, 2015","I found a  used vehicle online offered by Classic, a 2014 with 31,000 miles.    The salesman was great over the phone, seemingly very helpful and cooperative.   So, I drove over 100 miles  from my home in Central Texas to view and purchase the vehicle.   After buying the car, I found out the vehicle had three outstanding recalls after taking the car to another dealership---serious mechanical recalls.    Also the salesperson at Classic had assured me the vehicle was equipped to add options I wanted.  I found this not to be true.  After calling him about this issues, he assured me he would look into the problem, but I did not hear from him on the day he promised to call back.    I eventually called the used car sales manager at Classic.    I finally traded in the vehicle to another dealership when I experienced trouble with gears sticking after about a week of owning the vehicle.   My story has a happy ending.  I traded the car in to another dealership in Central Texas and got a great deal on a newer vehicle with the options I wanted.   The people at Mac Haik in Temple are outstanding.  They helped me get from under a problematic vehicle.   

In fairness, the used car sales manager at Classic  was responsive to my concerns and was prepared to do whatever was necessary to make me satisfied with the car; however, by that time, I had already traded the vehicle.   The business office workers  at Classic were also great in helping me to get a refund on the extended warranty I had gotten with the original vehicle.   

But, I will never deal with the Classic again, although I am originally from the Southeast Texas area and am frequently there visiting family.  ",1.0
109,"July 20, 2015","Worst experience I've had from a dealer.  Transmission went out in my car, and was not repaired properly until back-to-back trips.  Worst of them was the first time, after the car was still showing the same issues when I went to pick up the car AND the steering wheel was misaligned after they reconnected it, but of course I had to point that out to them instead of them correcting their mistakes first.  They sent me home in the car, claiming it was safe, and the service manager just claiming I only need to ""pump the xxxx out of it"" to get the clutch working again.  Thankfully I did make it home, but the clutch completely went out again the next morning.  Took several hours to get them to respond and finally schedule a tow back to the dealer, but when I got it back the second time a week later, it started leaking fluid in my driveway again two days later.  Went back for the third time, where it was finally fixed.  

The quality of work is terrible, they just throw parts at the car whether it's actually the issue or not, don't fix issues that they cause unless you bring it up and make them (and even then, you have to schedule a new appointment), and as a whole just don't treat customers well.  I also received two calls from their customer survey department, asking if I was completely satisfied with my repairs and the work received....while the car was still in the shop both times.  When I told them how dissatisfied I was, their only response was saying they understand if I don't call them or use them again.  At least they understand, as I will never do business with Classic again!  Even easier, as I sold the car on July 18 after having absolutely zero faith in the quality of work and long term reliability of the car!  ",1.0

113,"May 26, 2014","At the ripe old age of 64, I have purchased a few cars in my day (both before & after Internet).  Unfortunately, I have dealt with many slipshod, careless, and unprofessional dealerships big and small, from NY, NJ, TN, FL, NM & TX. This was certainly not the case.  I can say it was one of ""THE BEST"" car buying experiences I have had. I answered an ad online & followed up with a call next day. I dealt with Mr. Kevin Lee. On the phone, I found him to be responsive, courteous, knowledgeable and professional. So I drove the 100 miles for a test drive and wound up making the purchase on the 'proverbial' spot. The '05 Toyota Solara convertible was everything he said it was and more! This is one of the very few times in dealership shopping, that when I arrived (24 hrs later!) the car was out front, ready-to-go, washed and with a new inspection sticker, brakes done, oil changed, & windshield washers replaced. It was also rare that he began with the very few things that were ""wrong"" with the car before extolling its virtues! Most guys/girls begin with singing praises and never seem to get to the work a used car might need. Note: there was nothing really ""wrong"" with the vehicle that one would not expect from a 9 yr old car! The next thing that impressed me was that we sat down and he immediately gave me the car fax to look over then answered any questions I had. We got right to price. I told him I had done my homework in Kelly Bluebook, Edmunds & NADA so I asked for their ""best offer"" and got it; so... I took it as I felt an 8-10% reduction was fair to expect. It was simple business. They made their dollar and I felt as if I had gotten a very fair price off of their asking and it was done. Kenny Lewis, the finance guru, was courteous, prepared and efficient with the whole stack of unavoidable paperwork. Would I go back? YES. Would I recommend? YES Am I completely satisfied? YES.

163,"February 18, 2013","Aaron was very friendly, and not at all pushy. He even showed us less expensive alternative we had not thought about just to help us make sure that we were really getting the SUV that fit us and our lifestyle. There was no haggling or sales tactics, I had researched the trade in value of our old SUV and the price I was willing to pay for the new SUV, and gave him those numbers. He took those numbers to his sales manager and came back within just a few minutes to let me know that they had accepted my numbers, with one exception - they were willing to go $500 LOWER on the sales price of the new vehicle than what I had offered. I was shocked! Side note: I had not counted on my wife wanting the automatic retractable running boards and had not researched them beforehand so I had overestimated their cost. They could have easily taken advantage of me on the running boards (I was the one who had made the initial offer) but they didn't. I still would have gotten a great deal (we were about $6000 under sticker already), but their honesty really impressed me. 

Aaron was very busy that day, and it was late in the day, but he made sure we got through the finance department, made sure the vehicle got washed (even though the detail department was about to close) and filled up the gas tank. I would recommend Aaron to anyone looking for GM or related product. 

The finance department was great too. I was braced for the usual onslaught of add on offers and prepared for about an hour of saying ""no thank you"" repeatedly, but he wasn't pushy at all. He really only offered us an extended warranty, which my wife has gotten on every vehicle we have purchased for her (My wife has always ends up getting her money's worth out of those plans).

I would definitely recommend this dealership and especially Aaron. ",5.0

He was very helpful, honest, and willing to work hard to get me in the car I wanted.  I thought I was shooting for the stars with my choice of a car, but this guy made it happen. He worked with me to get the monthly notes I could afford to my surprise.

The next step was the finance department. This was the part where I almost had no hope in passing being a college student and working a part time job. Albert was the finance guy who made the deal official. He was easy to talk to and very considerate.  He worked to get me in MY car and it literally took an hour and half to maybe two hours to actually drive out of the Classic Chevrolet parking lot.  Joe Brown proceeded after I had signed the papers to explain to me everything I need to know about the car & answered any questions I may have had.
