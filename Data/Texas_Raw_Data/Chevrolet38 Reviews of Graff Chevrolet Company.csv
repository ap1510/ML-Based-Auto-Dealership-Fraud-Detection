0,"June 02, 2020","So, I shop online and find the exact car I want.   Take a trip to the dealer, smaller dealer than what I thought, but what the heck, maybe this could be a different experience.  Talked to a sales person, showed him the stock number, he looks it up on the computer, says I will be right back with it.  I go to the bathroom, come out , and he is just standing there.  He states that this car is in Sherman Texas.   Then why is it being displayed as it is in Grand Prairie?  He further goes on to say that if we complete the paperwork and get things in order, then can bring the car down.   Do these dealers really think people would purchase a vehicle site without being scene?  What is it with these dealers....   Just amazing.  All they are worried about is the signature....   Needless to say, this would be the last place I would recommend to people let alone ever walk back into this dealership.  I can't wait to see their canned reply, please call us so we can be of more service.  I read all of their online reviews, and that is the only reply they have, please call us back and talk to us.  Sorry, you had your chance and you mislead me on the vehicles you had on the lot.",1.8

DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT DO BUSINESS HERE!!!!!! Me and my family of 6 only had one car at the time and realized how hard it was to function with one vehicle so we scarified for months to save up to purchase a 2nd vehicle. When we finally saved up we thought it would be better for us to purchase from a large car lot, not the small mom and papa kind because we know how how they function as far as they’re notorious for selling you anything. So what we thought was going to be one of the best days for us in a while turned into one of the WORST moments in our life. We purchased a truck here on 7-11-2019 at the Graff Chevrolet at address 1405 E Main St, Grand Prairie, TX. Buy the time we made it off the freeway headed home the vehicle was make knocking noises. So we called the salesman and he said to bring it back in. So we brought it back. They said it was the transmission and it needed to be replaced and the warranty DIDN’T start until 30 days after the sale. The manager said the only thing he could do was fix it and they would pay for it. We asked for another vehicle or our money back and he said he couldn’t give us another vehicle and we couldn’t get our money back either. We tried to call the bank to see if we could cancel payment but no luck. So in total we had our new vehicle that we only had for a few hours and brought it back for them to fix. The service department had our vehicle for 41 DAYS. And during the 41 days we had to keep calling for something to be done. We also called our salesman and he informed us that he quit due to our whole situation. He informed us to contact him if we needed more help with our situation and encouraged us to go higher up and do formal complaints because of the ridiculous situation. We even called Chevrolet corporate to file a complaint. So we finally get a call saying our vehicle is ready to pick up. The way they called made us feel like they were unsure about if the vehicle is ready. 10 minutes before the service department closes and it’s still messing up. We drove 1 block from the car lot and ended up turning back around because the problem is not fixed. The vehicle is still doing the same thing and worst. So we go back in to express our concerns about the vehicle not being fixed. We insist that the manager comes to test drive it to see the problem, he insists on sending a couple of different employees to do it. He says nothing is wrong and We asked for our money back for the second time. He acted as if we SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN upset. The manager says it’s nothing he can do and his already done too much at this point. I’m so upset now I’m fussing and don’t know what else to do I call the police and they said it’s a civil matter and was told to never return or I would be charged with trespassing. He literally banned me and my family from the premises. Not to mention my four small kids were with me and my baby girl cried on the way home because she was saying it feels like the wheel coming off. I had to explain to her that it’s just the part under the hood and we would be ok and at that moment the check engine light pops on. We’re not allowed back so we’re stuck with a horribly unsafe vehicle for our family. It literally feels like the motor is going to fall from underneath the vehicle. They wouldn’t release any paperwork stating they even fixed the problem which apparently they hadn’t.",1.0

9,"December 21, 2016","My wife purchased a 2016 Chevy Malibu in April. Since that time, my wife has made 7-8 trips to the dealership to fix battery saver active light which keep coming on. They have had multiple technicians work on her vehicle and light still comes on. They sold her a lemon and refuses to take responsibility for the problem. If you have other options to purchase your new car, you have been warned, stay away from this dealership.",1.0

11,"May 03, 2016","O before sending me over there. The whole process was very unprofessional. So I got my rental car and went
to work. On the way home ( I go by that exit on 121) I called and asked Calum if he could get the Graff Chevrolet
sticker taken off my car. He then proceeded to tell me he had been so busy he did not call me to let me 
know that the part was back ordered, and I would have to pick up my car, wait for the part,then bring it
back. I then said my gps said I would get there at 5:58 p.m. can I come an pick my car up. He talked to
the cashier and said I could not pick my car back up until the next day because Candy does the rentals and she
has to be there. I asked why, I was just dropping the car off, she could check it in in the morning? He said
they could not leave it on the service drive overnight. I was upset. I did not want to be late for work
another day and I wanted my car back. I called the dealership back and asked for the service manager, and 
Calum said he had left to go to a soft ball game. I asked for any kind of manager, and he said no one was
there. I asked him again why I could not just come and pick my car up and he said I could not. He said I
would have to talk to a manager tomorrow.

I absolutely DO NOT understand why I could not of picked my car up!!! This is poor customer service.

13,"February 29, 2016",When our old car broke down I dreaded going to a car dealership and haggel for a good deal and be pressured to buy something I didn't want. I was told buy a good friend to go to Graff Chevrolet and see Jim. I took his advice and to my surprise Jim made me feel comfortable and answered all my questions. He did all the haggeling and got me a great deal on my Dodge. I would tell anyone looking for a car to be sure to go to Graff Chevrolet. All of the sells men there go over and beyond to help you get the best deal with no pressures. ,5.0
14,"February 09, 2016","My approval was done over the phone, and it only took a few minutes!! They held the car that I wanted until I went in!! When I got there, everything went smoothly!! The best part about it all was after the financing was completed (which only took a few minutes also), my payments are lower than they quoted!!! The salesman, Jim, was cool, and he made sure that I understood everything and that I was comfortable with the car and the deal!! ",5.0

16,"January 11, 2016","I've been without a car for almost a year because I could never go to a dealership and they get me a good down payment & reasonable car note. Jim definitely did that for me! He worked all the numbers before I even stepped in the door. By the time I got to the dealership I was already signing the paperwork. All the pricing was exactly what I wanted. I was never at any time given the general 'dealership run around'. It was smooth, fast, and a great deal! I truly appreciate Jims help, I highly recommend him to anyone looking to get a 'like new' used car, with true no hassle.",4.8
17,"January 07, 2016","I had my eyes set on a specific car and when one popped up on Graff Chevrolets pre owned lot I wanted to go test drive it. I submitted an interest form on cars.com and received a call from Jim Wickersham. We arrived shortly after and Jim immediately took us on a test drive with no hesitations. He was very relaxed and seemed like a genuinely good guy. After the test drive I wasn't planning on purchasing the car that day, but we went ahead and applied just to see what my payments would be along with my interest rate. Jim came back with a very reasonable offer that required little out of pocket expense on my part and kept my payments right where I wanted them to be. Jim was very patient as we waited to get a second opinion from my father who had to drive almost an hour to get to the dealership. The signing portion took maybe 15 minutes and we were out the door! I got to walk out with a great deal in a very short amount of time especially being a first time car buyer! Overall it was a very easy experience and I would highly recommend visiting Graff Chevrolet and speaking to Jim! 

Pros
- Very laid back but still efficient 
- was able get approved as a first time buyer with little income
- fulfilled every promise made
- Jim was great, he made a scary process super simple
- price was great

Cons
- really nothing bad to say except maybe get some window tint as the building got pretty hot from the sun



Thanks Jim! ",5.0

32,"August 22, 2014","On Monday August 18th I used this dealership's web site to order a rear cargo mat for my 2015 Suburban.  I filled out all the information. Never received an email or call.  Never got the part.

On Thursday August 21st I made an on line appointment for my wife's 2002 Firebird Trans AM.  The appointment was for 9:00 AM Friday morning, the 22nd.  I arrived at 9:00 AM and got it into the shop.  At 5:30 this afternoon I called the dealership to check the status.  I was told that my vehicle had not even been looked at.  I asked why and was told that they were 3-4 days out on repairs.  I told the person on the phone that I would be in to pick it up.  I was livid.  No one had called me, no one had told me that repairs were that far out.

When I got to the dealership the service writer who took my vehicle told me that she was about to call customers at 6:00 PM.  The dealership closes at 6:00 PM.  I picked up my vehicle and told them that I would never be back.",1.3

In all my years in Texas, I have had the best customer service at Graff Chevrolet in

They are prompt, efficient and most importantly courteous/respectful to your needs and wants about your auto repairs.  They dont tell you what they cant do....
they let you know right up front what they can and will do to take care of 
your customer needs. 
Keep up the great work.
I will always go back to Graff for any future needs with my automobile.

36,"July 06, 2012","BEWARE THAT ALMOST EVERY CAR ON THEIR LOT IS HAIL DAMAGE AND THEY DON'T DISCLOSE THAT INFORMATION OVER THE PHONE. THEY GET YOU OUT THERE AND TELL YOU THEY WILL FIX IT FOR THE PRICE THEY ARE ASKING.  ONCE YOU THINK YOU HAVE A DEAL RIGHT BEFORE YOU SIGN THE DOTTED LINE THEY TELL YOU THE PRICE IS GOING TO GO UP IF YOU WANT THE DENTS FIXED.  ARE YOU SERIOUS? FIRST THEY LIE SAYING IT'S INCLUDED IN THE PRICE LISTED AND THEN AFTER THEY SEE YOU WANT THE CAR THEY PULL A BAIT AND SWITCH. ASKING FOR MORE $$$ YOU HAVE TWO OPTIONS. 1. (WHICH IS WHAT I DID) WALK AWAY OR 2. BUY A CAR WITH HAIL DAMAGE AND HOPE THEY FIX IT PROPERLY AFTER THEY CHARGE YOU EXTRA FOR SOMETHING THEY COLLECTED INSURANCE MONEY ON.  KEEP IN MIND IF YOU LEAVE THEIR LOT WITH THE DENTS YOUR INSURANCE COMPANY WILL NOT EVER COVER THE AMOUNT OF THE HAIL DAMAGE IF YOU GET INTO AN ACCIDENT. YOU WILL BE OUT OF POCKET THAT EXPENSE! I JUST WANTED TO WARN FELLOW CONSUMERS OF THE DECEIT GRAFF CHEVROLET PRACTICES.  

STAY AWAY AND YOU WILL BE BETTER OFF!  DON'T GO SEE JESSIE BECAUSE HE IS ONE OF THE ONES THAT WILL LIE TO YOUR FACE AND TRY TO ROB YOU BEHIND YOUR BACK WITH EXTRA CHARGES AFTER THE FACT.",2.0
