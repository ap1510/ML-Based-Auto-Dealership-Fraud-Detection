0,"March 02, 2020","Terrible service. I had an appointment at 8:30 am. I also asked them to check my blue tooth because when I am driving on the interstate people tell me they can hear a noise that sounds like air blowing into the mic. This only happens when I am driving fast. They took 2 hours to do an oil change and tell me nothing was wrong. They told me they test drove my car. When I went to leave, I checked the mileage and they had put less than one mile one my car so I highly doubt they drove it to test the Bluetooth speaker on the interstate. ",1.0

3,"September 30, 2019","Blake went over and above making sure I understood the features and benefits of the Outback and made the buying process easy.  Great sales experience, and what has really impressed me further is the service department!  Wow!  Super easy to set and keep up with appointments with the ap and they touch base after to see how they did.  The service is appropriately fast and my car is cleaned when I get it back!  I feel like I'm using a very high end dealership every time I walk in JK Subaru!  ",5.0

5,"August 23, 2018","Extremely unhappy with this business. 
Subaru of America is not affiliated with JK SUBARU. They are independently owned. 

Although I absolutely LOVE Subaru, I do not, however like this business. They do not care about their customers and they do not know how to care for your vehicle while it is being serviced. If they damage another part of your car, while it's in their possession, they still make you financially responsible for the damages.  They are also in no hurry to repair your vehicle.  The owner will back up his employees if they make a mistake (intentionally or unintentionally)  which is great for them but a bad business tactic which brings me back to JK SUBARU does not care about their customers.  They just lost a customer who owns 2 Subaru's and plans on buying more.  We will be doing our business in Houston from now on.",1.0
6,"August 13, 2018","Always prepared for my visit - on-line scheduling makes it easy to make/ change appointments. Well-appointed waiting area - snacks, coffee and cold water available. Service associate updates customer on progress. Perform an overall vehicle check, wash and vacuum car. In three visits (two oil change/ tire rotations, one warranty issue) they have always finished earlier than they estimated. ",5.0
7,"May 15, 2017","I would first like to say Thank you so much for the perfect shopping experience. My Aunt lives in Mississippi. There are no local dealerships in her area. After research and recommendations, we decided to purchase from JK Subaru. I currently live in Houston and traveled to Nederland to pick up a 2017 Legacy to bring to my aunt in Mississippi. I dreaded the idea of purchasing a vehicle out of state for her. I knew there would be a lot of back and forth to get paperwork completed. Boy was I wrong! This transaction was easier than if I was purchasing the vehicle locally or for myself. First off, my sales consultant (Pat Smith) greeted me at the door as soon as I approached. They had all of the paperwork ready and highlighted for my aunt to sign. Pat went over the basics of the car and gave me some valuable information on the vehicle. Daylyn Turner, the General Manager is one of the nicest, accommodating, most welcoming GMs I have ever encountered. He knows his brand! There was not one question I asked that he could not answer. JK Subaru gave me the ultimate ""all about you"" experience! I literally did not have to do anything but drive the car away and the 2017 Legacy does most of the driving for you. (awesome car) My Aunt Loved the car, I loved driving it to her, but I mostly enjoyed my shopping experience with this dealership. I HIGHLY AND EXTREMELY Recommend doing business with this dealership. A+ 
Thanks again JK Subaru. You just gained a loyal customer!",5.0
