1,"May 07, 2020","I recently bought my daughter a Jeep from David Keilson at Sewell Lexus of Dallas.  This was by far the easiest car purchase of my life.  I found the car on the sewell.com site and at that point there were no pictures.  Not to worry,.. When I called... i was fortunate enough to get David on the phone.  When I inquired about the Jeep, I let him know that it was on the site but there were no photos.  Within a few seconds he was in front of the car and I had is smiling face on FaceTime.  David had me thinking I was actually at the dealership looking at the car in person.  I have always heard that Sewell has some of the nicest cars... and boy was it nice.

At a time during this pandemic... I was a little worried to go into the dealership, but that was not a problem.  we had the deal done in no time and signed documents electronically.  Then within a few hours the car was delivered to my house (and they were very cautious with face masks and gloves).

I never really believed that you could actually buy a car without leaving your couch.  But this was actually exactly how it happened.  Who would ever trust a car salesman???  Everything David told me was accurate and the car was nicer than he made it seem.  

Upon David calling me to thank me for the purchase, I could not help but notice the number of awards in his office.  I would imagine there were 75 - 100 awards showing that he was the #1 sales person and he only told me about them after I mentioned how amazing my experience was.  

Well... needless to say, I would highly recommend David for the purchase of any Pre owned vehicle.  His honesty, sincerely and true commitment to making my purchase as easy as possible shows that there really are good people in the car business that you can trust.  

David... I am a customer for Life.

2,"March 09, 2020","Sewell Lexus offers high-quality services paired with great pricing. All of their sales associates go above and beyond, but I specifically worked with Brookes McIlhenny. He was patient with me during my first time and worked with me to make sure I understood what the options were and what was best for me. He has continued to provide exceptional service even weeks after my purchase, making me feel more confident in the decision I made to go to Sewell. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",4.8
3,"January 22, 2020","My dad, who was 84, leased and purchased vehicles from this firm for several years. He passed away in early January 2020. I tried calling his representative, the woman that leased him his vehicle to ask her how to proceed. She never returned at least 4 of my phone calls. Finally I spoke to the receptionist and  she was GREAT, she gave me the number to the Lexus Financial  Office. I then called them and they refused to give meany information regarding my dads account.  I sent them my dads death certificate, the VIN# and other documents they requested. The Financial office is being totally ridiculous. They do not return calls and wont give me or any others in my family any information regarding our account.  I found documents that shows my dad paid up front the full payment.  So now I have a vehicle at a residence that we had to vacate all of his possessions, but NO one in The Lexus Dallas office & NO one in the Lexus Financial office will give me any guidance as what to do with this vehicle. we have submitted every document they asked for but they still refuse to acknowledge us!!!! UGH!!!!",1.7
4,"September 03, 2019","These guys are greedy and dishonest people. Literally will try to upsell you every time. First time I took my car there for oil change they did an inspection on my brakes and said they were good but my tires had a nail in it and it needed to be replaced, second time I took my car in 5k miles later at 30k miles for the brake pads to be changed, they said my rotors needed to be replaced if not my car would have to be towed out the dealership. Wouldn’t use this dealership ever again. ",1.6
5,"August 21, 2019","Spent two hours at the dealership, negotiated the sales prices, negotiated trade, agreed on finance rate with the sales person.  Then was told the finance rate is not advertised anywhere and for me to find it.  I walked away, went to Park Place Grapevine same deal, and the same finance rate that was agreed upon that is being advertised by Lexus at the lower rate no issues closed the deal and walked out with a new 2020 NX within an hour.  Having been a Sewell customer for the past 7 years was extremely disappointed with this experience, and being lied to.  If they didn't like the deal that was negotiated they should have just said so rather than lying.  Will never be doing business with a Sewell dealership again.  ",1.0
6,"August 05, 2019","The people at this dealership have to be the most dishonest and greedy people in all of North Texas. I have been trying to assist my 57 year old mother in negotiating a price on a 2019 ES350 Luxury for over two weeks now. Sewell Lexus has made the experience excruciatingly difficult and unfulfilling. They will lie to you and tell you a vehicle is not available for purchase if they cannot expect to rob you blind in broad daylight on the price. For example, a gentleman by the name of Kelvin Newton will ignore every reasonable request, if it doesn't increase his bottom line. I bought my mother on her only day off to test drive a vehicle that actually doesn't exist. Instead of alerting us to this, Mr. Newton went to collude with his manager Ms. Melissa Lauck on how they can extract as many dollars as they can from my mother. 

He then went to goof off in the dealership for an hour and showed us a car with less features for more money. We decided to leave at that point and give another dealer a chance as they were highly unhelpful and thirsting for profit. I decided another day to give Mr. Newton another chance to sell us the correct vehicle. He wonderfully fails to do so and offers to sell us a vehicle with body damage fresh off of the carrier truck. He lies and says he's at the dealership and has viewed the car, when he had just told me he was not working that day moments before. So, I then had some choice words for him about his conduct. He then decided to separate from me and the transaction in an elaborate sob story worthy of an Academy award. Do note that he will still benefit from the transaction if we ever do get to purchase a vehicle.

 His manager Ms. Melissa Lauck is just as much as an actress as he is an actor. She has sat in her gilded office and barked at me for days over the phone and email like she is the district attorney of Dallas. She has delighted in being smarmy, making me and my mother, who’s a pharmacist, feel like idiots. She has said repeatedly with confidence that she can no longer price the vehicle competitively. Just to let people know, dealership salespeople and their managers etc. receive immense monthly bonuses, quarterly bonuses and secret incentives from Lexus to encourage them to make as much money as possible no matter what .They also get a bonus called holdback they receive purely for selling the car. So, they can surely keep the excuses for their greed.

 Don't believe the hype they have created on television with their commercials. Those free car washes, cookies and marble floors in their dealerships are costing you thousands. The people I described are complacent in their ways and they are getting cosigned by their superior Mr. Ross Taylor, who was also very smarmy on the phone explaining this issue. I asked for accessories for the vehicle worth less than $200 to finish the deal, and Mr. Ross Taylor made no concerted effort to be helpful. It explains well how trifling they can be at Sewell Lexus.

7,"March 22, 2019","I just leased my second RX350 from Sewell.  When I leased my first one in 2016, I leased it with Daniel Martinez.  I returned in 2019 and again leased it from Daniel Martinez.  Daniel is a very efficient and effective sales agent.  I am impressed with his professionalism, his compassion and his humor.  He makes a highly stressful decision comfortable and easy.  I love the Sewell service!  ",5.0
8,"February 26, 2019","I purchased my first Lexus from Sewell Lexus of Dallas back in 1996 and several more since then. Sewell’s service levels have dropped dramatically over the past 23 years. Our sales person lacked the attention to detail and service level that we’ve received in the past. It was almost as if we were an inconvenience to them??? Sloppy follow up, poor attention to detail, rushed process, missing information etc... Sometimes a dealership can just get too big for their britches!

After my purchase at Sewell I called and left several messages along with e-mails to the General Manager to share my concerns but he couldn’t of cared less. No response or acknowledgement from him whatsoever.

But on a positive note, yesterday I purchased a brand new Lexus from Park Place Lexus in Grapevine, TX (my first time being there) and received the attention and service level expected from a Lexus Dealership.",1.0
9,"December 04, 2018","I bought a used Lexus from the Used Sewell Lexus in Dallas.  It was supposed to have been inspected by their service department and they ensured that I should buy with confidence. After 3000 miles of driving, the car's head gasket blew and this was after I took it in for its routine maintenance at their service department.   Since I didn't buy a warranty, I was out of luck and was quoted 9K for the fix.  They could not do anything for me.   Moral of my story, I will not trust their service department and I should have bought a warranty.  I will not buy another car from them.   ",3.2

12,"January 29, 2018","I leased my 2017 RX 450h through Sewell just a few weeks ago and can't speak higher of my experience.  After one too many negative experiences with my local Chicago dealership's sales department, I decided to broaden my search.  Sewell had the exact vehicle I was looking for (color combination/options) so I inquired online.  Dawn Betrus was very responsive and upfront, answering any questions that I had (boy were there many), making this out-of-state purchase a breeze and putting me at ease.  We quickly reached a deal and I then booked a flight to Dallas for the following weekend.

Their Dallas facility is perfectly located next to Love Field, so I was picked up by Dawn at the airport and at the dealer within 15 minutes of the plane touching the ground.  Dawn immediately took me to the car for a walk-around to make sure it was everything I wanted and more.  Thankfully, it was!

I then worked with Jennifer Blilie for the paperwork and lease documents.  Given that this was an out-of-state purchase, and that I was coming from a state that did things very different than Texas, I expected this to have a few bumps.  I was wrong!  It was flawless and Jennifer had everything taken care of prior to me visiting.

I wrapped up the visit with a 30 minute technology demonstration of my car's new features.  I'm sure Dawn would have given me more time if I needed it, however I was very familiar with the features already from my other Lexus.  What was a really nice touch was that she was familiar with my old car (a 2010 Lexus), and she focused the demo on how the features have evolved since then.  We personalized all of my settings (and then some), and then the garage door was opened and I was off on my 900 mile drive home - 900 miles to fall in love with the car, as I put it.

These two ladies went above and beyond in making this a positive experience, and they succeeded.  I have never been so satisfied with a vehicle purchase experience, and appreciate that they were honest and fair upfront without having to play any games.  This is how car dealerships should be!

While I do not live nearby to take advantages of the free car washes, you can bet I will be back the next time I am ready to purchase/lease another Lexus!  You can also bet that I will recommend you without hesitation to anybody that I can.  Thank you for everything!",5.0

You will not get a favorable review from me or anyone else I can personally persuade not to use your services   Shame on you. I drove 11 hours round trip for a kick in the teeth. Thank goodness I own a reliable car. What you tried to pass off on me would not make it around the block with out needing to go in for repairs. So much for your L certified $30K car.

16,"June 06, 2017","First, let me start by saying I am sorry I can not give this place 0 stars. I have scheduled an appointment (Def: An arrangement to do something or meet someone at a particular time and place. See Synonyms at  engagement...S: TF Dictionary) at Sewell to have an oil change for 20k miles on my RC350 for today. I arrived in time and to my surprise I am last behind a long line of cars. A ""Service Advisor"" arrives and when I ask about the appointment, his answer is: Oh, the appointment doesn't mean anything here, first came, first served. In dibelief, I ask to talk to a ""manager"" who happens to be just nearby ( I have noticed during the time spent there an whole army of advisors and managers, most looking really bored) and he confirmed that there is no meaning to ""appointment"" at Sewell. So I mentionned that if it is so, I should maybe bring my car to a closer to home dealership instead of driving to Sewell, and with a smile he invited me to feel free to do so. I am told that the wait will be about one hour and fifteen minutes, an that is the only thing I was told. I have specifically notified them that I did not want a car wash, nor a test drive and the engine air filter is a K@N so it doesn't need to be replaced. In the middle of the wait, looking through the shop window, I have noticed one of my wheels being taken off. So now my ""Service advisor"" is Tiffany, who informs me that they found a nail in my tire, to what I answer that my tire doesn't leak air and I do not plan on having it fixed by Sewell. The car is finally back, engine running and Tiffany is on a phone...for a while. So some guy gets in my car and leaves. When I question where is my car, Tiffany smiles and answers that they are driving it around the dealership while the cars behind get out. When I express my disbelief, she offers to fill it with gas. So i rush to the register to pay and get out of there as soon as possible and they ask $235 (all I asked for was oil change). So when I ask them to explain what was done on my car to justify that amount, they keep looking at each other and I get a ""manager"" who tries to convince me that my tires where rotated, etc. Well, on the RC350 there are directional staggered tires and that was not done. And the CABIN air filter was not replaced ""per my request"" (Sic! engine air filter=cabin air filter). So I pay just to get out of there and take the road to go home, and after 6-7 miles, the flat tire light comes off on the instrument panel. I exit the highway and under a torrential rain, I check my tire, sure enough, the same tire is flat. When I call back and question the ""manager"", he tells me that they pulled the nail off the tire to check if it was going through (and they put in back on)!!! I was not told any of that while I was there.Thanks Sewell for not only stealing my money but also putting my life in danger, letting me drive the car without letting me know what your technician did!!! I finally got home 4 hrs after my appointment with the car on a truck bed. I will never, ever set my foot in a Sewell of buy a Sewell car again!!!",1.0

21,"December 07, 2016","In March 2013, I purchased a new ES350 from Sewell Lexus in Dallas.  My reason for choosing this car is that I typically drive my cars for 8-10 years, and the utmost priority for me is reliability.  I was assured by Sewell’s salesman, Maury Erbay, that I was buying the most reliable car on the road.  He told me about a rare circumstance with another buyer who was unsatisfied with the maintenance history of his/her Lexus and how Sewell made it right.

6,569 miles, August 2013
Upon leaving the car at the airport for 4 days, the car was dead.  Roadside assistance came to jump the car, and I drove the car to Sewell.  It was Sewell’s opinion that nothing was wrong with the car.

15,442 miles, March 2014 
Upon leaving the car at the airport for 5 days, the car was dead.  A co-worker who had been traveling with me jumped my car.

33,808 miles, June 2015
Upon leaving the car at the airport for 4 days, the car was dead.  Roadside assistance came to jump the car, and I drove the car to Sewell (exasperated by the complete unreliability of this car).  I was told that Lexus has “just learned” of a problem with the Gateway ECU, and mine was replaced.  The service representative told me that I had not been notified of the fix because it had “just been discovered, in fact subsequent to my last oil change at 30,000 miles”.  I did some research on the internet and found that Lexus had identified the problem for other owners in 2014.  I asked myself many times why there wasn’t a recall for this issue, but it appears that fixing an issue that causes its customers to be stranded isn’t a priority for Lexus.  It is inconceivable to me that Sewell prides itself on service, yet they were aware of this problem and did nothing to fix it until I had been stranded again and brought the car to Sewell.  Because of the multiple unnecessary drains on my battery, I insisted that the battery be replaced.  Sewell resisted and finally agreed to the replacement only after a lengthy argument.

45,828 miles, April 2016
The car’s locking system failed, and the driver’s door actuator was replaced under warranty.

50,000 miles, July 2016
Warranty expires 

50,200 miles, July 2016
Back seat begins to squeak loudly when no passengers are riding in the seat.

50,756 miles, August 2016
Air conditioning fails.  Lights illuminate, but no sound from air conditioner is present, and no air came from the vents.  As a courtesy, Sewell picked up the car but found nothing wrong with the air conditioner as it started for them.  However, the fan was noisy and needed a new bearing which was replaced at no charge.

52,900 miles, November 2016
The car’s locking system fails again, and the passenger’s door actuator was replaced at my cost ($500 parts and labor).  By now, it appears that the other two doors are likely to fail soon as the quality of the actuators in the Lexus ES 350 is poor.

53,400 miles, December 2016
A dull thumping noise quickly progresses from infrequent to extreme.  While it sounds as if it is a suspension issue, the real issue is the sunroof rattling.  This repair is projected to be a 3-4 hour repair job and is not covered under warranty.

As is clear from the above, the car has been a maintenance nightmare.  The reliability factor that was conveyed to me at the time of purchase has been completely non-existent.  Never in my years of car ownership have I been stranded (and stranded multiple times) by any vehicle other than a Lexus.  It appears that the maintenance issues are becoming more frequent.  (One has to wonder when the last two door actuators will fail when two already have.)

Upon discovery of the 52,900 mile problem, an email was sent to Sewell’s business manager (Cecily McClarin), Sewell’s service manager (Mason Kessner), and Sewell’s general manager (Dudley Haralson) expressing my level of unhappiness with the car and its track record of poor reliability.  Based on the Sewell promise Maury made at the time of purchase of the car, I expected to hear from upper-level management at Sewell.  Instead, I heard nothing from anyone.

I am prematurely near the end of my Lexus journey (due to poor service and poor reliability) and am close to making a decision about which car I plan to buy next (clearly, not a Lexus).  No one from Lexus demonstrated any effort to retain me as a customer by offering a trade on another Lexus at a discount in an effort to win me back. I leave as an unhappy customer determined to share my Lexus story with as many car owners as will listen.

25,"September 23, 2015","I purchased my car from Sewell in 2011, where I received outstanding service in the sales department. I know that people often leave reviews when things go south, and I hate to be another person on that list. For so long I looked to Sewell as the benchmark for customer service, and they have since disappointed with their lack of helpfulness. 

I have been especially disappointed with the customer service in the service department. There have been multiple instances where I have spoken with unfriendly or unhelpful customer service representatives and left(or hung up the phone) without a solution to my problem. Sometimes I joke that I feel like I am on the phone with the cable company because it is so unproductive. 

My grandparents and parents have been customers of Sewell for over 30 years and plan to move their business. While Sewell prides itself on customer service at the time of purchase, it seems that promise is short lived. It appears that Sewell only values your patronage when you purchase a car.

I spoke with someone at Park Place Lexus in Plano who went above and beyond to accommodate me. Even though it is 30 minutes north of my house. 

I would love to remain a loyal Sewell customer, and hope there is a solution. ",3.2
26,"April 29, 2015","I have two equally bad experiences - in 2010 I bought a used car to replace one that was totaled in an accident. I drove it for a bout a week and then the dashboard lite up. Took it to my Mechanic and he discovered multiple issues with the engine and other issues. Spent over $3000 over the next several months fixing it. 

This year I got an offer for a great deal and against my better judgment went in and stupidly fell for the sales pitch and again bought a used car from them. However this time around I had told them about my prior experience and they actually pulled up the old purchase and noted that this was why I had received the offer. 

After telling them my story about the old car and getting apologies and even confirmation that the dealer that sold me the original car had been fired from them, I was silly enough to consider buying another car form them. I believed them and rolled the dice again. 

I bought a used 2007 BMW X-5 from them, at over $17,000+. My first warning sign was when their own dealership would not finance the vehicle for their ""best price"".  I already had my own financing so I went ahead anyways. After buying the car, I was driving it home only to notice on the drive home that the steering wheel was now stiffer than during the test drive prior to buying the car, and that  the engine RPM was also a bit odd, and  some cosmetic issues (AC vent caps were not held in place by anything). 

The following day my wife drove the car and noticed that the AC was now only blowing form the center vents and not at all from the side vents, despite any attempts to get them to work, and the check engine light popped on briefly. She took a picture on her phone and sent to me and due to my prior experience I immediately returned the car to them. They had a technician look at it,  and after going through my list of concerns assured me that nothing was wrong with it. Even said they would give me that guarantee in writing. I never got the written guarantee. 

Skeptical I took it to a reputable shop and had them run a complete pre-purchase diagnostic for $120, something I had been too cheap to do prior to purchase as I honestly did not think they would sell a luxury car with that sort issue and put their reputation on the line. Boy was I wrong. 

He found a check engine light code and from what he could tell from the vehicles computer that code actually had tripped a few days before I completed the purchase, meaning they knew about it, and did not disclose it. 

I sent it back to them along with a full report of what the repair shop found during their inspection, and they claimed not to be aware of it, but said they would take it to a BMW dealership to check it out. They then called me back and asked me to pay half of a $1200 repair charge if it is fixed. 
Horrible dealership. Great personable people who act like they care but only want to stick you with whatever they can get away with. 


Be forewarned, and buy your car elsewhere if you are buying it used, these guys in my experience are total rip offs hiding behind the appearance of a respectable name.

27,"March 20, 2015","Dawn Betrus from Sewell - no other way to put it.....simply amazing.  She was fast, reliable, knowledgeable, but most importantly honest.  She's just as beautiful on the inside as she was on the outside.  Given she had been given so many awards one would think that she would be snooty or a good scam artist.  That is far from the case with her.  I originally went to Park Place and also did intensive research online to make sure I was getting a fair price.  Being a woman, let alone a single mom -we are usually targeted as easy bait.  I emailed her letting her know what I wanted.  She immediately got back to me with a price no one could beat.  There was no haggling at all!  So I thought to myself, ""I bet she is going to get me in the trade-in or the finance"".  She did not.  She matched the trade-in price that Park Place gave beat them by 1k less plus gave me an interest rate (with no fees or penalties) that my bank could not beat.

28,"August 25, 2014","Even though we've been loyal Sewell Buick/GMC customers for more than 10 years, Sewell Lexus has been amazingly unresponsive as we've tried to buy a certified RX350. We've sat down, emailed or talked by phone with one salesperson after another and told them what we wanted. The lack of responsiveness is amazing and surprising. Examples: 1) Emailed David in the Spring and asked if we could rent an RX 350 for the weekend to see if we liked it. He never responded.  2) Sat down for 10 minutes one Saturday in July with Dylan and told him what we're looking for. Told him we'd be out of town for a week but to call us with something once we were back in town.  One month has passed, and we've still heard nothing. 3) Emailed a young female salesperson a few weeks ago with what we're looking for. She did follow up with a phone call, where I repeated what I had written in the email. I then sent her an email a few days with a price inquiry and asked that she reply very soon because we were close to buying another car. Three days later, I've not heard a word from her.  I think the issue is that they're hiring all of these fresh (Class of 2013 or 2014) college graduates who lack the aggressiveness and hunger of more seasoned salespeople. Sewell, we tried.  ",1.8

Maury Erbay has sold us every Lexus we've bought at Sewell, and he has never once let us down with pricing, service, and friendliness.  I've recommended him to several friends and colleagues, and he's always treated them with the same high caliber of sales and service expertise.

Last week, due to a hit-and-run driver who ran a red light, we had to put our beloved LS to rest.  Sewell was the first place we called after the police.  They sent a tow truck, delivered the car to their collision center, and kept us up to date on the evaluation process.  After weighing our options, we wholesaled the car, took a cash settlement on insurance, and bought yet another car from Maury.  We pick it up tomorrow!  During this whole process, the team at Sewell (Collision, Sales, and Service) treated us as concerned family.  

While I'm praising, I have to put in several words for Mike Davis, our service consultant.  He is always responsive, courteous to a fault, and works with us to ensure our service experience is top-notch.

Finally, Alex Oger, technologist extraordinaire, who answers my most ridiculous questions, with a smile and a completely understandable answer.

If only other companies had the approach to customer service excellence that Sewell has, I'd be happy!  Customer for Life, Indeed!!",5.0

Within 2 weeks we were driving the car of our dreams, which was actually delivered to the dealership. Our sales consultant was Melissa Lauck. She was exceptional! We have purchased five cars in the last seven years and this was the only experience that wasn't stressful from start to finish. We also purchased a vehicle from a different Sewell dealership, and know that all Sewell's offer top notch service all around. We will most definitely be purchasing a second vehicle when the time comes from Sewell Lexus of Dallas and will be asking for Melissa. Thank you Sewell Lexus of Dallas!!! :) Thank you Melissa!",5.0
34,"March 22, 2014","I began my search for a pre owned Lexus on line and found what I thought would be one I would consider at Sewell Lexus. I quickly sent then an email to inquire as to the car's availability. Within 30 minutes I received a reply from Randy Brown stating that the car I had inquired about was still available and He asked if I would like to schedule an appointment to come to the Dealership for a test drive. In the meantime I found two other car's in their on line inventory and also inquired about them. Mr. Brown was very responsive to my inquires and we scheduled an appointment for Saturday morning. Mr. Brown sent emails each day before our scheduled appointment just to let us know if the cars we had selected to look at were still available. My wife and I arrived early for our appointment and Mr. Brown had the car we had expressed the most interest in washed and pulled into a prominent location for viewing. As soon as my wife saw the car she completely fell in love with it so there was no further reason to look any further. We took the car out for a test drive and returned to the dealership with thoughts in mind of completing the purchase of the car. We quickly agreed on a sales price and began the paper work. Up until then we had only been at the dealership for about one hour and by the time we left it had only taken two hours to do everything before we were able to drive our new car home. 

I would highly recommend Sewell Lexus Of Dallas and Mr. Randy Brown for those of you wanting to purchase a pre owned Lexus. Mr. Brown, as we were leaving, even sang Happy Birthday to my wife as we had come in on her Birthday, which he had noticed from her drivers license. I thought that was a nice last touch.",4.8

She did her best to reply to my emails as soon as possible and she provided the information that I asked for. After we had a deal on the car, she suggested that I fly to Dallas to Love Field airport cause it's next to Sewell.

38,"September 06, 2012","Sewell Lexus of Dallas, Christine Weesner (Sales Associate - cweesner@sewell.com; 214.353.2106), and Alex Oger (Technology Specialist – aoger@sewell.com) proved to provide incomparable customer service throughout the entire event purchasing my second Lexus from Sewell and Christine.  I was consistently updated on the progress of my trade-in as well as purchase.  From start to finish, the process was the most swift and efficient I have experienced.  Sewell, Christine, Alex, and all others within the dealership I interacted were informative, helpful, and friendly. 

Christine and Alex obtained my vehicle settings preferences and had everything set-up when I was ready to pick-up the vehicle (which they offered to deliver if more convenient!).  Having previously owned two Audi's, after a year or more, I would ""discover"" features I never knew existed in both vehicles.  Examples include a six-disc CD changer housed in a back, side compartment with the first Audi and with the second options to view and select various information such as the average use of gasoline per gallon; present rate of speed; current trip mileage; or another alternative of the six or so available.  My career heavily surrounds innovation of technology, including user-friendly functionality; nevertheless, I struggle familiarizing myself with new vehicles' technology or rather, I did.  I have not found myself fumbling around, flipping through the manual, or becoming frustrated while attempting to acclimate myself with the Lexus RX’s technology due to the time they spent explaining and demonstrating the features and functionality of the Lexus RX.    

Before meeting Christine at Sewell Lexus of Dallas for my first purchase, I assumed trading-in would be a feat by reason of previous experiences with much less complicated trade-ins; however, I was shown to be incorrect as it was handled quickly and seamlessly, unlike all previous involvement with dealerships, trade-ins, etc.  My thoughts of purchasing a vehicle in the future by no means included a better scenario, but again, I was enlightened by way of my second purchase.

I am unable to emphasize the amazing display of customer service provided by Sewell Lexus of Dallas, Christine Weesner, Alex Oger, and all other Sewell employees I encountered.  Regardless of your interest in a Lexus, I highly recommend setting up an appointment with Christine Weesner (cweesner@sewell.com; 214.353.2106) to familiarize you with Lexus vehicles as well as Sewell Lexus of Dallas’ way of doing business, not only because you may find something of interest as a result of Lexus’ superior ratings in all areas including safety, reliability, quality, and technology, but also to experience the precedent Sewell Lexus of Dallas sets for all dealerships as it should be no less at any other dealership than what I assure you will encounter with Sewell Lexus of Dallas and Christine Weesner.",5.0
39,"April 21, 2012","My IS350C was towed into their dealership 4 weeks ago when the retractable roof got stuck while in the motion of going down.  After two days they called and told me that there were marks on the window that indicated that the trunk came in contact with an object in the trunk causing the motor to burn out.  They called this customer negligence and told me the warranty was not valid and it would cost me $10,000 to repair.  I told them that I never had anything in the trunk, I had only owned the car for three weeks and there had to be another explanation.  They never entertained that idea and throughout the four week process continued to blame me and my negligence.  Ultimately two different people from Lexus corporate and my insurance company got involved.  My insurance company denied the claim saying there was no damage and it was a warranty claim issue.  Finally, a district representative was asked to come see the car.  When I was called following his visit and I asked if he had authorized the work Trae said ""it didn't matter because the motor just started working"".   No one could explain to me how it suddenly fixed itself.  They went over the car carefully and checked settings and measurements and after four weeks I finally picked up the car at no cost to me.  I am not satisfied in the way I was treated throughout the process.  Communication was poor.  I was not given updates, I had to call for them.  I was treated like I was on trial, trying to prove that I didn't do anything.   It was a very stressful four weeks and I was extremely disappointed in the service department.",1.3

I brought my Terrain in several times to the Panhandle dealerships to be dismissed every time. This was so frustrating because the vehicle only had 8,000 mile on it. During Spring Break I decided since I would be in the Dallas area I would drop my Terrain off at Sewell GMC where I was approach by Justin Townsend. I voiced my concerns and addressed the knocking noise. Mr. Townsend reassured me he would figure out the problem. Mr. Townsend provided me with a loaner vehicle and always made sure I had everything I needed. I ended up taking Sewell GMC's loaner vehicle back to Amarillo while my Terrain was still being fixed. After a few days it was determined that my engine needed to be replaced in my Terrain. Mr. Townsend was more than willing to send his staff on an 8 hour drive to return my Terrain to me and then have his staff drive their loaner vehicle back to Dallas. I have nothing but outstanding things to say about Sewell GMC. The customer service Justin Townsend, Head Technician, and management provided me is truly unheard of.  They were prompt, efficient, over the top accommodating and so willing and eager to make this a hassle free experience for me.

57,"June 29, 2011","GET a 2ND OPINION BEFORE HAVING WORK DONE HERE!  I've been a customer at Sewell since 2003 when  I purchased my car there.  I've been bringing my car in for regular service/oil changes ever since.  A couple of weeks ago I brought my car in for a regular oil change and was told that I had valve and cam leaks that would cost $1500 to repair.  I told them because it was such a high-cost repair that I would bid out the repairs. 

I did a lot of research to find a repair shop that had great reviews (I chose MasterTech in Plano) and took my car into them for a 2nd bid/opinion.  When I dropped it off they said they are seeing more and more people who are coming in for a 2nd opinion after dealers (including Sewell) have told them work needs to be done only to find out the car is fine.  They said if the work does need to be done, their cost for the same repairs was $900. Sure enough, my car was fine and MasterTech returned my keys and car at no charge.

I was shocked.  Sewell's 'Customer For Life' policy has clearly been abandoned. Due to this betrayal of trust, I will never take my car there again and I advise anyone reading this to avoid them as well.",1.4
58,"June 27, 2011","I purchased a used Lexus from a dealership in another city, but I live in Dallas so I was taking the car to Sewell for an oil change and to take care of a recall notice I recieved.  During the service on my car the service person noticed that the inside edge of my front tires were completely bald and the cords were showing, obviously making it very dangerous to drive.  Scott called me to let me know about the tires and informed me that they were the result of bad alignment on my car.  Because the visible part of my tires had plenty of tread left on them and I knew the original owners took excellent care of the car, I was hesitant to believe the tire problem.  I expressed my concern to Scott and he confirmed that I wouldn't necessarily be able to see the tire problem unless I was underneath the car.  He also volunteered to take a photo of the tires and send it to me, so I could determine how to move forward.  The photo Scott sent me was shocking.  The cords on the inside edge of my tires were completely revealed.  I asked Scott to have new tires put on and to fix the alignment, which was taken care of that day.  
As a female I often have conerns about being ""taken advantage of"" when it comes to service on my car.  Not only did Scott willingly explain to me what was wrong with my car, what caused the problem & how Sewell could fix it, but he also went above and beyond to take a picture of the problem in order for me to have confirmation of the severity of the problem.  I drive all over the DFW area for work, so driving a vehicle that is in the best possible shape is incredibly important to my work and my safety on the road.  I am thankful to Scott & Sewell for helping me stay safe on the road.

I made an offer via the internet, and sent a message saying I was very interested and wanted to drive the vehicle. Anthony Albino was the sales person.

I phoned him around 6:45pm to let him know we would be there to view the vehicle around 7:30, and we we strongly anticipating buying the car that evening. When we arrived, they couldn't find Anthony. Once he finally came up, he told us repeatedly that we were lucky he did not 'slide out' early, as he had already sold a few cars that day. I reminded him that I left a voice mail that we were coming, as instructed. Apparently he never even cared enough to check it, because someone else sold the car at 3pm in the afternoon. We asked to look at some similar vehicles, and he seemed uninterested and acted like we should come back another day.

The dealership is a first class operation, the building itself is first rate.  I would recommend them to anyone.  I had requested some extras for my car and they were agreeable without any issue.

(I was reading some of the other buyer ratings and I found it silly that the dealer should be held accountable for company employees signing crazy lease agreements.  Those companies should send an experienced buyer to make the best possible purchase for their business.)

I have my answer as of this morning: 2/16/2009, ""absolutely nothing"". The lease agreements were for (2) company vehicles. One was an RX 400h, and the other an RX 350. The RX 400h contract is for $914/month, and the RX 350 is for $775/month, which is ludicrous. They were written with 80,000 and 60,000 mileage terms for (48) months, which far exceed the 50,000 mile factory warranty. Who does that? No attempt was made in the beginning of the transaction to reduce the cap cost on either vehicle, and obviously nothing was done to make the monthly payments even remotely reasonable.  I spoke with the GM there, and he pretty much said ""too bad"". When I told him he had lost two customers, he said ""so what"". Carl Sewell wrote a book on customer loyalty a while back. I guess those days are far behind them. These two lease agreements are a prime example of an overall lack of business ethics. The 400h was even a demo, and it was listed as such on the contract!

First, regarding service, I took a brand new 2003 SC430 in for its first checkup at 1000 miles and when I came back to pick it up, the entire surface area of the vehicle (hood, roof, doors, trunk) was completely scratched.  Apparently, when they washed the vehicle there was something in the bristles of the brushes that scrub the car that caused the damage.  In any case, I didn't even receive an apology, but rather a simple, ""we'll try to buff it out"" from the service manager who acted like it wasn't a big deal at all.  After bringing the car back out three times and still seeing scratches all over it, the service manager gave up on me and even tried to tell me that it was my imagination when they were all clearly visible.I later had another terrible experience with the sales department when I went in to purchase a 2004 LS430.  My salesman up until then had left the dealership, so I worked directly with the sales manager.  Despite all the business I had given this dealership, I was patronized and treated with arrogance as the manager refused to take anything off the sticker price of the car.  I then met with the general manager who tried to sit me down in his office and give me a lecture on how great his dealership was and why he didn't need to give me a discount on the vehicle, even if it meant losing me as a customer.  Well that was all I needed to hear.  In the end, I purchased the vehicle from Park Place, fed up with my experience at Sewell, for a couple thousand off MSRP the same day.Unless you want arrogance, irresponsibility, and a lousy experience with both sales and service, don't waste your time.  Stick to Park Place where I've had a far superior experience every time since.  In sum, don't let the illusion of politeness when you walk in the door fool you into believing that this place is about anything more than making big money.",1.0
