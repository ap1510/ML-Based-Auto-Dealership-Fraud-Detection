0,"January 03, 2018","I've owned five Porsches, and have found that Porsche has trouble finding and keeping quality dealers all over the country.  My experience with the Service side of Porsche of San Antonio was terrible, even when compared to the sub-standard Porsche dealerships in Colorado--Stammler and Porsche of Boulder.  I bought a $150K Turbo Carrera from Stammler, and they were de-authorized within three months of my purchase.  Porsche of Boulder did the best they could, but the volume wasn't there for them to support the Porsche business.  And the last straw was when I moved to San Antonio and experienced the worst possible incompetence on the Service side I've ever experienced.  Three weeks of mis-diagnosis on my Cayenne S and $2K rental loaner expense on my part, and NO DIAGNOSIS or conclusion.  I drove my Cayenne directly to another dealership and traded it in.  Cost me $8,000 to just get it running enough to trade it in.  I'm DONE being a Porsche owner.  Not sure how Porsche of America manages its dealers, but it's not working.  You would think when you're paying premium prices, you could at least expect competent Service.  Grade: F.  Never again to buy a Porsche.",1.0
1,"June 16, 2017","I purchased a CPO Porsche from Porsche of San Antonio. It was a hard to find car, and since I live in CT it was a total phone/e-mail/FedEx deal. The sales person Bryan was great. He was very responsive to my relatively demanding questions (paint meter, service history, warranty work, detailed pictures of various hinges and screws, DME readings, CPO process and services, etc., etc., etc). A+ for Bryan and his support. The finance manager Craig was also a pleasure to work with when it came time for paperwork. He was also very responsive and informative about all the various financing details. The dealership recommended a vehicle transport company which worked out fantastic. 10/10 for the folks at Porsche San Antonio!",5.0
2,"February 08, 2017",Today I needed to get my car inspected  in order to renew my registration. I live 45 min away and pass up numerous places to get my car inspected but I'd drive even further to Porsche of San Antonio just to experience their first class customer service. They make you feel like a part of their family and I always feel well taken care of whether it's a standard car service or car purchase. Marco and Courtney are the best! I will remain a member of the Porsche family because of Porsche San Antonio. ,5.0
3,"May 13, 2016",I would stay away from this dealership as much as possible. Just had the worst car buying experience of my life with a racist sales manager!!!! The sales guy and the finance guy were great. He raised the price on me and then asked me to go back to where I came from when I asked for a explanation all that befor his racial slur,1.0
4,"September 14, 2015","From the moment I stepped into Porsche of San Antonio' showroom to explore available options, to the moment I got the keys to my new GT4, my experience was fantastic. Dale was very patient and resourceful. He provided all the information I needed to make a decision and timely replied to my numerous emails. Once my car was shipped, I received an email to track it online. After my Porsche arrived, Dale scheduled a time for delivery. The paper work took 8 min with just few signatures and 15 min later, I was on my way home with my Porsche exactly how I wanted it. Thank you Dale and Porsche of SA for making this purchase a very memorable experience. I highly recommend Dale and Porsche of San Antonio. I will certainly buy another car from them.",5.0
5,"February 10, 2014",I had seen the vehicle on ebay and was interested in it. Monti contacted me to see what we could do to further the sale. After some negotiations we decided on a price. He was very helpful with one of my friends coming to see the car to look over and test drive. Mostly he was very good at responding to my emails in a timely manner. I had lots of questions and he took the time to answer them all. I would buy from Porsche of San Antonio again.,5.0
6,"October 21, 2013","Monti Samuels was an excellent Sales Person. He was friendly, knowledgeable and made our purchase great.
This was our 9th Porsche we have purchased over the years. We had such poor service when we bought our 2012 Carrera S from
Roger Beasley, it was worth our time to drive To San Antonio from Austin to purchase our 2013 Panamera. Even thou we drive 135 miles
one way for service it is well worth it. When we buy our next Porsche it will be from San Antonio and hopefully Monti Samuels will be our
Salesman. ",5.0
7,"October 21, 2013","Very pleased with everything! Went in to buy a gently used Porsche and ended up buying a new 2014 911S! Never felt any pressure. First time I've bought a car other than my brothers Toyota which he sold this year, where  I didn't feel played. Monte (first time to ever meet him), not once played games or pressured me. He has a loyal customer because of his salesmanship. Great product, great service, great location!",4.8

11,"October 08, 2013","From the moment that I parked my car at the dealership, Mr. Monti Samuels made my Porsche buying experience Awesome. He is truly a professional. His knowledge on all of the Porsche models was impressive. I would recommend not only Monti Samuels but the entire Porsche of San Antonio Team. Great Service.",5.0
12,"October 07, 2013",Exceptional service I would highly discourage going elsewhere to purchase a Porsche 911! They are very friendly and service oriented. They went out of there way to make it great.,5.0
13,"September 01, 2013","Purchased a used, certified 2012 911 over the internet from Porsche of San Antonio.  My advice is don't trust this dealer over the internet.  The car was listed as a great deal which I thought was due to the 2 months they had this car in inventory.  I negotiated with them for a week and got nothing but them to cover the cost of delivery from a recommended vendor.  I worked with them on getting pictures and info on my current porsche for a trade in to only receive a low ball price which I declined.  They said this was due to the fact they could not drive the car.  I would soon figure out why they didn't trust me on the condition of my car remotely.  But we agreed to everything after that and I had committed to buy the car.   While i was getting financing, they""discovered"" that the car had the entire rear bumper repainted with no documentation.  Hmm.  after 2 months with the car they just now figured that out?  No way in my opinion.  I guess i knew now why it was such a good deal.  so, i saud what will you do for me on this mix up?  They were not willing to discount or compensate me in anything way for my time but simply said ""take it or leave"".  I was very frustrated and escalated this to the sales manager and GM of the dealer who said, ""that's the price, take it or leave it.""  I looked every where for another car like it and did not see one so I swallowed my anger and purchased it.  On delivery, I was surprised to learn that the discount they gave for delivery was half as much as the actual cost from their recommended transport company.  Hosed again.  On delivery the car was poorly detailed and they left absolutely nothing in the car to make up for the situation during the sale.  I thought maybe they would leave a gift card for merchandise-nope....fill up the tank- nope.... Leave a thank you note and apology at least-nope..  Nothing.  So i started driving it and was pleased with the car.  Within 3 hours of driving the car it threw 3 ""emergency run"" transmission errors locking the car into that gear requiring me to stop and restart the car.  It seemed to go away after that and I had a warranty so I moved on.  I did fill out the porsche survey I got. i was not kind.  I got a voicemail that said ""oh sorry you did not have a good experience (they were surprised?)....and basically Porsche America said we had to contact you.  So call us back if you want to.""   I didn't.  What's the point.  Then several weeks later the transmission error happened again and it started happening every two or so weeks from that point mostly at stop lights.  Then last week the error was thrown going down the highway and 70 twice in one day forcing the car lose all power putting me a risk of getting hit in rush hour traffic!  So i took the car to my local dealer.  When I took the car to get this problem fixed (it will take almost 2 weeks to fix when they get done, they said ""Oh, we see where porsche of San Antonio tried to diagnose and fix this problem!  They misdiagnosed it and fix something easy that was not right.""  That explains why it had the issue on delivery- it was broken and they knew it!  They didn't disclose this car had a transmission issue history nor was it even fixed when they sold me the car!   Wow- that is terrible service and definitely not trust worthy.  Porsche of San Antonio may be a fine dealer for local purchases but I would not trust them for internet purchase were you have to trust the person you are buying from.",1.6
14,"December 23, 2010","Recently took a trip from the Dallas area to San Antonio in my 1975 Porsche 914.  I had contemplated purchasing a newer model, and made a call to The Porsche Center to see if they were even willing to consider a restored automobile as a partial trade.  Got J.R. on the phone, and was convinced to stop by.

A few hours, a few test drives, and a bit of paperwork later, I left the dealership smiling ear to ear in a much newer car than I arrived in.  During the entire process, both my wife and I were treated extremely well and the sales processs was as pleasant as possible.  I am completely satisfied with both the experience and my first late-model Porsche.  I'll likely be back in a couple of years to get into a newer CPO model as well!",5.0
15,"July 09, 2010","In a word OUTSTANDING!!!!

The service, support, knowledge and friendliness are exceptional.  Highly Recommend this Porsche Center to everyone.

You can't find a better place in Texas.  The sales, service and receptionist all greet you by name--outstanding ",5.0
