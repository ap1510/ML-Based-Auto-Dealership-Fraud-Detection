34,"February 16, 2017","Bought a 2016 jeep renegade in September of last year. It now has just under 7000 miles and has been back to this dealership two times for the same issue. The second time, they had it for a week and put over 300 miles on it. When they gave it back to me, it was covered in dirt and bug guts. I cleaned it before giving it to them. I washed it later the same day and found multiple rock chips on the front end. When I brought it to their attention they told me they would touch it up with a paint brush................... Really! A new car? They refused to fix it properly. In the meantime, my car started doing one of the same problems again, so I took it back to been boyd. They refused me a loaner because I told them they were being dicks about the rock chips they caused and refused to fix properly on my car. Never buy from benny.

It all started with a text message from Eric Crumley.  I told him what I was looking for and if he could keep my payments almost the same I was in.  Well Eric did exactly that. Notified me on Saturday that he had found my truck and Tuesday I was driving home in it.  My payments went up 50.00!and I was offered an excellent trade in on my 2014 Ram 1500 Ecodiesel.

True service after the sale.,5.0
64,"September 12, 2016","If I could give less than one star I would. Absolutely horrible service. I bought a 2016 Dodge Journey Crossroad 3 months ago, which has now been in their shop 3 times. Literally shuts off in the middle of street and they said the put ""800 miles on it"" and it didn't do it for them. My car has now shut off on me in the middle of the road 4 times. They refuse to help us in any way, even if it was just helping us to trade it in for another vehicle. This dealership had such good reviews that we thought it would be the perfect place to purchase from. it's pretty bad when you buy a BRAND new vehicle and it is at their shop more than you drive it. They've completely washed their hands of our issue and turned us over to Dodge, whom is also unwilling to help us since Benny Boyd has stated there is nothing wrong with it. Let's not forget 2 weeks after having it, it was already back in their shop because the transmission sensor didn't work so my car wouldn't shift past first gear. I expected more from a company with 4.1 out out of 5 stars. Definitely will not give them my service EVER again. Beware if you think they care about their customers.",1.0
65,"September 10, 2016","After Benny Boyd made a mistake in quoting me a lower price than what they should have, they honored the price point for the final sale.  They also made the effort to bring the truck to me from across the state and even offered to deliver it to my home.  They did stick true to their belief in integrity. ",5.0

Very friendly and helpful staff. Makayla was awesome! Shawn was very helpful and really worked with us on getting the financing that we wanted.,5.0
102,"December 19, 2015","Saw a truck at their Liberty Hill location but had only seen it at night and it was not well lit. Next time I called they had moved the truck to Lampasas. So before I decided to go there I asked the saleswoman to please go out and look at the truck and make sure there was not any damage inside or out before I drove 75 miles to their location.  Saleswoman called me back to say she had put her hands on the truck it was on the lot and there was no damage anywhere. I drove there and as soon as you walked up you could see the bumper was obviously bent in severely on one side. I decided to test drive it since they said would replace the bumper and inspect for damage (seems you should have already done that for your customers??). Before I took the truck for the test a woman stating she was Mrs. McInis the the Sales Managers wife came over and asked for my drivers license to make a copy. I gave her the drivers license and she made a copy inside, then came back to the truck and pulled all of the balloons off of the truck so I could drive it.

There was a distinct drive-shaft type of vibration through the entire truck when you drove it; so I decided right the I wasn't spending that much money for a truck that had these issues and drove back to the dealership. As we drove up I told my girlfriend to make sure I asked Mrs. McInis for my drivers license back since she still had it.

When we arrived I told her I didn't want the truck, but did need my drivers license back. She then went into the office and after about 3-5 mins she had not come back yet; so I walked inside.
When I entered I heard my girlfriend say ""I'm just trying to help you find the drivers license you lost and your taking an attitude toward me??""

What she had said to Mrs. McInis to draw her ire was; ""Why don't stop a second and retrace your steps after you made the copy of the drivers license. At this point she started insisting she had given it back to us already and we had lost it; because she does the same thing EVERY TIME and she knows what she did...

At this point we were tired of dealing with Mrs. McInis so I walked across the street and summoned Mr. McInis the Sales Manager to see me as it was urgent.

I explained to him his wife had apparently lost my drivers license, couldn't find it and was now blaming us? I explained to him I had to travel Monday morning and had to have the license.
As we started to cross the street they had sent a man over to move the truck we had test driven to the garage to be looked at, and after he backed out my girlfriend saw the drivers license by the wheel of the next truck where she had lost it as she pulled the balloons off the truck.

Never apologized or said she was mistaken or anything. After 2 over hours we finally got to leave.

111,"July 02, 2014","Rey was exceptionally in helping us find and acquire our new Grand Cherokee.  We had been working with three other Texas dealers, with no material success.  Rey not only made an initial attempt to find a suitable vehicle at another dealer, he persisted after multiple failed attempts (both in and out of Texas), eventually locating a vehicle for us.  Not only that, Rey was forthright and helpful regarding the 0% interest incentive; where other dealerships were decidedly unhelpful.

I can't say enough about Rey's performance in helping us locate and acquire the vehicle we were looking for, in such a short period of time.

I was also very impressed by the service after sale when told about the cost of oil changes, extended warranty coverage, free towing, etc.",5.0
