It was extremely easy to immediately trust him, which made what can be an oftentimes frustrating experience in car buying a smooth and enjoyable one. I highly recommend working with Terry for your next pre-owned purchase if you are in the DFW area. I know I will.",5.0

After calling the dealership we found out a car we were interested in wasn‚Äôt available , he quickly gave us options and within 8 hours we had the perfect car! he was kind, knowledgeable & made sure we got the best deal for the right car WE wanted! Cannot praise this dealership enough from how fast and kind everyone was.. bonus their financing team beat our credit unions rate! ",5.0
3,"May 18, 2020","LONG BUT WORTH THE READ:

This was the best experience I have ever had by far with a dealership. If I could give them a higher rating I would. I was specifically dealing with Terry Layman. I had been looking for a 3.5 Ecoboost F-150 for quite awhile. I came to realize to get any kind of deal, I was going to need to look outside of TN. (they really really like their used trucks here judging by the prices) Needless to say I found a 2013 F-150 with 112,xxx miles at their dealership in TX. That meant I would need to travel quite a distance, as I live in TN. I must admit, I was very reluctant to put money on a plane ticket with the thought of ""what if it isn't in the shape they say it is"". Terry was extremely helpful in reassurance. Every question I had, he answered. Every picture/video I asked for he supplied...and quickly I might add. I flew down to give the truck a look over with the intentions of picking it up if everything checked out. Sure enough, everything checked out and I left that day with the truck. The closing went extremely quick as well. He asked for a few things ahead of time, which made the process extremely fast.

I took delivery of the truck and made the trip back to TN. It was not a drive straight back. We stopped at a few beaches and places along the way for overnight stays. The truck drove perfectly!! Mechanically it was everything Terry said it was. However when I I got home, I went to open the sunroof and it would not function properly. I was thinking to myself ""great...here we go...why didn't you think to check that before hand...you will never get the dealer to help with the repair cost...you bought it with an as is warranty"". Hopeful, I reached back out to Terry and explained that when I got home and went to function the sunroof, it was not operating properly. I didn't even need to ask for them to help with the repair cost. Terry quickly apologized and said they were going to help. He also took care of the negotiation with the Ford dealer on the repair. Huffines almost completely paid for the repair, which was not cheap I can tell you that. This was very much to my surprise, because as I said, I bought a 6 year old used vehicle with an as is warranty.

Again, I can not say enough how great of an experience I have had with Huffines Chrysler Jeep Dodge Ram in Lewisville, TX, specifically Terry Layman. I would highly recommend this dealership. They are very trust worthy and stand behind the vehicles they sale. ",5.0
4,"May 15, 2020","I just experienced the easiest and most pleasant vehicle purchase in which I've ever been involved...and I'm 57 years old!  Surya Bhasin was a joy to work with throughout this process of purchasing a used vehicle online.  We exchanged several emails and phone calls in which Surya patiently and humbly asked just the right questions to clarify exactly what I wanted and needed in the truck I was seeking.  Once that was done he delivered an absolutely beautiful Dodge Ram 1500 LoneStar which had everything for which I was wanting.  The negotiation of final buying price was fair and reasonable I've walked away feeling better than I ever have about a ""Used Car Salesperson""!!  Thank you Surya, I will recommend you to anyone anytime.

Bill in Finance & Insurance was also outstanding in his role.  I can tell you that we purchased an after market product that I genuinely feel is a fantastic and fair option to extend the warranty for my new used truck.  Our total time on site from driving onto the lot, test drive, price negotiation, credit review, and signing contracts was right at 2.5 hours...awesome and easy.  Thank you!  ",5.0
5,"May 14, 2020","Our experience was easy and fast even though it was during the covid-19 pandemic. Finding the correct vehicle, submitting the application online and financing was the best service I have ever experienced in my years of buying a new vehicle.

7,"May 13, 2020","Thank you Thank You Thank you! Terry made buying my 16 year old her first car the best experience at a car dealership. He was very informative and down to earth. Never hassled me like dealers you hear about. I will be going back to Terry when i decide to get my next car. Thank you for everything you did for us. My daughter even enjoyed him and she is hard to win over!!! LOL :) 

Raquel from Finance was also a joy to be around. She was very informative too. She treated us like she had known us for years. I really appreciated her. Cant wait to be back in your office and having a laugh!! Thank you Raquel!!",5.0
8,"May 12, 2020","And I say that because the entire experience seemed to last only a few minutes rather than the traditional hours with NO HAGGLING. De'Arien made it clear up front he was interested in getting us the best deal possible and it showed. I have nothing but positive things to say about the entire experience, and I'll encourage anyone in the market to give De'Arian a call before shopping elsewhere. ",5.0
9,"May 10, 2020","When it came time for me to purchase a new vehicle it was never any doubt that I would purchase another Jeep.  I went to Huffines Chrysler Jeep Dodge Ram in Lewisville, TX and there I met De'Arian Spencer and staff.  Not only was De'Arian not a ""pushy salesman"" he actually made the car buying process simple and a pleasure.  I never felt any pressure, he answered all of my questions and walked me through the entire process.  He continues to serve me by making my service appointments for me and asking me if I ever need any assistance.  Not only would I recommend Huffines but I most certainly would refer you to De'Arian.  Thank you De'Arian for all that you do!",5.0
10,"May 05, 2020","I will start by saying that this was by far the best experience I have ever had while buying a new car. It all started with me visiting the website and asking the pop up chat about rebates. Next thing you know, I have a new Jeep!
I was contacted by Surya thru email as requested. I laid out what I was looking for and gave him the #'s I wanted to be at. 30 mins later he had my deal done all thru text. All I had to do was come sign my paperwork and take possession of my Jeep. It was that easy. No dealer ad on's. No back and forth. I cant thank the Huffine's Team enough. P.S. Be sure and ask for a poem from Surya!",5.0

13,"May 02, 2020","Zack was amazing!!!!! He answered all questions and provided 2 realistic options based on what we wanted. He was not overbearing nor did he oversell. He was fantastic and I‚Äôd buy from him again/recommend anyone else to buy from him. 
The front staff was awesome and connected me to a sales person that fit my style. 
I do wish the finance team would have had masks, sanitizer, or used larger spaces to allow for more distance.

15,"April 20, 2020","I just bought a 2020 Challnger RT from this dealership I have to say I had a great üëç experience.  John was fantastic and had understanding of what I was looking for and my expectations,  he was very astute and found me exactly what I was looking for at a great price. John had a partner take over and he was just as nice in completing the sale. There was no run around and getting to finance only took a few moments to complete.  My mom referred me to John and I would share the referral and recommendation to anyone I know in the market for a vehicle at this dealership.  Great job guys!",5.0
16,"April 18, 2020",I am considering filing a lawsuit and filing compliants with State Attorney's office. Have tried to resolve issues with the misrepresentations made by Scott Bradley but no response. They don't care they just want to trick customers. You should be ashamed of yourselves.,1.4
17,"April 11, 2020","from the first contact with Zack Victory to the signing of the contract with the finance dept, it was the easiest and friendliest experience my husband and I have ever had with purchasing a vehicle.  It was actually FUN!!!!  Thanks to Zack and everyone at Huffines Jeep in Lewisville ",5.0
18,"April 09, 2020","Vincenzo and Zack were both very professional and understood our needs. Everything got done right as soon as possible during the virus shutdown. They both worked hard to make sure we got the new vehicle without having to rent one until it arrived, much appreciated. We are very happy with the new Jeep and with the service we have received. This was overall the best experience for us and we had this Jeep built to what we wanted in it. A short note to Mr. Huffines, thank you for keeping the dealership open so that we didn't have to wait until everything is reopened to get our Jeep. We are enjoying it and it is exactly as ordered and as we wanted. Thank you sir, for supporting our military and disabled veterans. Bless you all.",5.0
19,"March 26, 2020","Buying a car at Huffines Lewisville was a very good experience. Hamed Awadi was my salesman and he is the best car salesman I've ever dealt with. He was very knowledgeable, friendly, and and truly concerned that I was totally happy with my purchase. Everyone I meet at the dealership was friendly, efficient, and professional. I highly recommend Hamed and the Huffines Lewisville dealership.",5.0

21,"March 08, 2020","I‚Äôve never taken the time to write a review but in this case; buyer beware. I was working with a sales person named Terry on the purchase of a Jeep Wrangler. We were down to financial information and I received a text saying ‚ÄúI think I got this done; just waiting on your financial info‚Äù. I sent it within 2 min of that text. I was supposed to head over there after work at 6 pm. He seemed very helpful and determined to get this done for me. The sales manager had also become involved to help us get this price right....
NO SOONER did I send the financial information, I received an email ‚ÄúSOLD SOLD! Just wanted to let you know that another salesperson sold the Wrangler we were working on, to a customer that was in this morning and the.n came back‚Äù. No apology; no ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry‚Äù. NOTHING! We had been working on this sale for 48 hours. An apology would have been nice. I will never deal with this dealership again. I took my business to the dodge dealership in McKinney; where the salesman immediately put a ‚Äúsold‚Äù sticker on it, with my name; while we see if we can get this done to fit my financial requirements. 
So just know; if you deal with Huffines Dodge in Lewisville; you may have your chosen vehicle sold out from under you! And if you do; there will be NO apology or anything done to help make it right. He didn‚Äôt even guide me to a possible alternative purchase or help me in anyway. Not even a follow up email. Disappointed to have been treated this way.",2.0
22,"March 04, 2020",I‚Äôm pretty sure people at Huffines cringe when they see me pull up to service. I feel like I always have something wrong with my car. Either way they are always polite and ready to help get me on my way. Mr. Smith is someone who always gets stuck helping me. This young man puts up with my attitude that I have regularly. He will even go out of his way to call and make sure he has everything ordered before I come in so there is nothing getting in the way of my service being completed. He will even follow up and make sure if I was helped by someone else that they made sure I was taken care of. This is definitely someone who I know will make sure my vehicle is in good hands when I come in. The whole staff is very nice especially the young lady in the front. ,5.0
23,"March 04, 2020","Joe helped me purchase a 2017 Chevy Silverado.  I went to the dealership twice and Joe was an incredible help both times.  He is very friendly and not pushy at all, i felt very comfortable dealing with him, and he is part of the reason I bought the truck at this dealership.  After we signed the contract, he had the service shop fix a few things that needed to be done to the truck, and he called the former owner and asked him to bring the spare key to the dealership.  He is just awesome to work with.",5.0

The finance manager, Bill Brand, also very helpful and offered excellent customer service to make sure I was happy with the final sale price and financing. The team also included Bruce Johnson and Bill Matson who were helpful in getting right price and remember me from the last car purchase. At this Huffines dealership, you are not just someone to make a sale to, but also feel they truly do care. I highly recommend Huffines for Jeep and Ram purchases and service.

54,"February 20, 2020","I had a good experience purchasing a 2020 Jeep Wrangler in January.  I wasn't pressured nor talked into anything I didn't want.  And I was pleased with the financing I received.  However, when I got my jeep home, I noticed that I had a tiny chip in the windshield and there was a small leak near the front passenger side.  Surya connected me with Jordan at the service department and he found that a axle seal needed to be replaced.  Rather than just replacing the seal, they installed a new axle and the chip in the windshield was filled. Unfortunately, when I brought the jeep home, many service lights appeared and had to bring my jeep back.  Jordan assessed the problem and was honest that it was related to installing the new axle.  They fixed the issue and I was able to bring my jeep home. Fingers crossed that I don't encounter any further issues.

To my surprise the one he suggested not only was a better fit it was lower miles and priced lower at the same quality level I was wanting. 

Thank you Terry.

We also met with Johnny Ray who went through our contract in detail with us.  While this was taking place, Scott made sure our new truck had a full tank of gas.  The customer service was awesome!  They didn't waste our time.  Both Scott and Johnny Ray were very professional and personable.  The way they conduct business, you get the feeling they care more about you the customer being happy rather than the sale. We drove away happy with our purchase.  No buyers remorse.

I had filled it up on my way to the service department. After I left the dealership I noticed my truck below a quarter of a tank. I again filled it and pumped 25 gallons to top it off. I reported the theft to the shop supervisor and got no solution. I told them that they had a thief who had a way to pump 25 gallons of diesel out.  
My truck has had a/c repairs twice prior to this service. This time air was not coming out of the dash vents at full force like a hose had slipped off. I was told that to correct this problem  the part was $3400.00.  No way would I spend that much on a 12 year old Dodge. 
The only saving grace was the fact that my Service advisor, Trey Bullion,  was honest with me about my truck repairs.  My Dodge only has 45000 miles and this was the third problem with the a/c system.

I wanted to ensure this was the car I wanted before I started looking to buy. I test drove a Jeep with Patrick. I loved the Jeep and he was very knowledgeable about Jeeps. He did not make me feel as though he was forcing a sale on me. He made it enjoyable. I left to think it over and ensure I wanted to commit to purchasing a new vehicle. I ended up calling Patrick 2 hours later to see if I could see how much I‚Äôd get for trading in my car. That‚Äôs when I met Zack. He helped see how much trading in my car would be and eventually made a good deal with me on the exact Jeep I test drove. I did not intend on buying a Jeep that day! However I did.

John was the first to actually pick up the phone and call me. He very confidently and transparently listened to my needs and got me in the exact vehicle I wanted.

195,"December 23, 2019","For Reference (the Manager with the worst attitude and customer service ever) if he was even a manager was Scott Spindle.

I went in to get an Oil Change, replace a run light and get a recall done on my car at Huffines Lewisville near my work.

Was told they didn't want to take the time to do the paperwork and get me a rental car for the Recall on my car. They said can you wait till the new year and just bring it back then. 
I told him I needed it fixed but he said it would be difficult to complete in a weeks time, I'm not sure why that matters but I said that's fine I will take it to the dealership near my house.

I asked if they could even do the Oil change and replace the run light that was out?
With an attitude he passed me off to the guy who handles the Oil Change.

Later I returned to pick up my car, and I opened the hood to look over the engine and check the oil dip stick.
I noticed the clip that holds my windshield wiper fluid in place was broken!

I went back in to ask the service guy to take a look and I was told he was in a meeting and I would need to wait 15 mins. So I walked back to the office where the meeting was being held, walked in and said excuse me there is a part broken on my car and I need him to come look at it. 

The Manager said who are you I responded with I am a customer and walked back to the car.

the manager and the sales guy along with 4 other guys followed me to the car and looked it over.
The Manager started to have a big Attitude! He tried to talk down to me and I butted in and said ""Sir knock off the Attitude, Right Now!""

The Manager did not even notice I said anything.

So I waited till he was done and said ""Whats with the Attitude?""

He just looked at me. So I repeated ""why do you have an attitude?""

He said ""I am going to look this part up"" and left.

He returned 5 mins later and started raising his voice again and I said STOP having an Attitude Right Now!
He paused and said I'm sorry, it has been a crazy morning, I have ordered the part and we will fix it. 

P.S. The light they fixed / replaced was very dim and after 1 day you can't even see the light is on unless you bend down to look at it and the message popped back up and says Run Light is out.

If I did not have to go back to have them fix the part they broke I would never go back to this Dealership. ",1.0

My name is Douglas Burack and I want to express what a great Service Department and Truck Sales Department Huffines of Lewisville has!

My experience started at Frisco Dodge and it was not good!¬† The service department was awful and there was no organization or lack of experience or leadership. They just rush you through and do not want to be bothered.¬† Not Good!¬† ¬† After several times of bringing my Ram there for service and constantly being told to wait, ""no loaner vehicle available"" and ""we are unable to fix the problem at this time""¬† plus they just have no respect for my time, I decided to go to Huffines Ram/Dodge of Lewisville as recommend by Chrysler headquarters.¬† (Now please understand that I live in Frisco, TX and the dealership is only 7 miles from my home, however, I would rather drive 22 miles to get to Huffines Ram/Dodge of Lewisville because I truly believe the service is 100% better)¬† This was a great suggestion, because there I met the best and most through service representative: Chris Tucker and his supervisor Philip McLean who also helped in my RAM service which was fantastic.¬† I was also very impressed that General Manger of Service: Scott (Unknown last name) was also involved with my services on my truck.¬† These men all together plus the other service adviser's work together as a true team and help each other out as well as take the time to help and work with customers coming in for service.¬† These people are amazing, caring and personal. They really listened to my issues, took notes, always put me in a loaner vehicle and constantly kept in touch with me. I also want to give credit to the crew on the driveway and thank some of the mechanics who came out and took the time to speak with me. Just a great experience!

I later decided I wanted a new Ram and spoke with salesman John Sheppard. This guy is great. Not pushy, listened to my needs and kept in touch all the time by text!¬† Gee, I thought I texted a lot!¬† After weeks of looking for the right truck, reality set in once I saw the price of the new Ram numbers and decided the price was out of my budget.¬† John did not stop there, he recommended I speak with Rafael Garcia in pre-owned sales. So I went to the other lot to look at pre-owned trucks.¬† Another great experience!¬† Allow me to explain!

In the pre-owned department my first contact was with Darrell Smithey, Pre-Owned Sales Manager. This guy is awesome, friendly, personable and knowledgeable. He then set me up with Rafael Garcia, as my sales representative. Rafael is amazing, knowledgeable and extremely through. He helped me with a beautiful pre-owned Ram Truck and both he and Darrell worked with me to stay within my budget, while selling me a 2014 RAam 2500 for a great price and in great condition!¬† These two men were true to their word, making sure the truck I bought was perfect to my expectations. This truck was clean, detailed, inspected, filled with gas and came with a free 3 month or 3,000 mile warranty (on the drive-train) without my asking!¬† I have to say, the overall experience was simply great and comfortable with no pressure and was fun. I have told so many of my friends about this experience and I highly recommend Huffines of Lewisville, TX.¬† I also want to thank Bill in the finance department.¬† He stayed late working to find me a great rate.¬† He even called to check on me the next day and sent all my paperwork to me saving me a trip back to Huffines.¬† 

You may ask....why am I writing this?¬† Because I understand customer's and people. Normally, you only hear the bad news or problems.¬† I wanted to let everyone know that there were no problems at this dealership.¬† All the people at Huffines's of Lewisville are fantastic.¬† Seriously, if you need a new car or truck, even pre-owned, they have a great selection.¬† My experience was truly great and I wanted to put it out there for all to see and read!¬† ¬†Thank you Huffines.

261,"November 18, 2019","Muy apologies, but this one can be ""summarized in just a few words.""  Please read the whole thing because the context puts Huffines Dodge way above my experience with other dealers in trying to solve a problem with my RAM 1500, so please read the entire thing.

I have the 3.0 Ecodiesel in my RAM pick up.  Those of you in the know a probably aware of the coolant loss through the EGR system problem (now under recall).  The recall just recently, but the problem showed up in my vehicle while on a road trip to Utah.  Malone Dodge in Heber City, UT diagnosed the problem as a faulty radiator cap (about a $50 repair).  Got back to Dallas (1,600 mile drive) and the problem continued.  Forest Lane Dodge diagnosed the problem as a leaking radiator.  I thought that $1,400 radiator replacement would solve the problem, but no, about a 1,000 miles later coolant is down again.  A second try at Forest Lane turned into replacing the overflow reservoir ($300+).  Exactly 1,067 miles later, coolant is down again...check engine light is back on again...another swing and a miss!  I go back to Forest Lane, where we learn the recall on a part (a coil I think) in the EGR system has just been announced.  They said a coil was not available, and that Chrysler was working on a remedial part.  I was told it would be OK to keep driving the truck (despite the check engine light), to replenish coolant as needed, and come back when Chrysler announces the remedial part is available.  Well, I have a 1,600-mile trip coming up in a couple of weeks so, I decided to go Huffines for a second opinion.  I gave Mike at Huffines the history, he was aware of the recall and said he would take care of the check engine light problem.  He sure did, and more!  My truck now has an almost completely rebuilt EGR system with all new parts, including a new coil, the part that is being recalled.  He said as soon as Chrysler has a solution for the defective part, bring it back in and they'll replace it.  It took 3+ years and almost 60K miles for the original part to fail. I'm pretty sure Chrysler will come up with the remedial part sooner than that.  Mike went the extra mile to make my engine as whole as possible.  How do you top that for service?  You do all the repairs as warranty work!   That's right...I didn't pay a dime.  I make a living gathering and analyzing customer care and satisfaction feedback.  Mike at Huffines got it right with me this time!  Not many cases I see stand out like this, but I am very happy I, as a customer, was on the receiving side of this one.  The other dealers in the area could learn a thing or two.

Thanks Mike!

I made him aware I had already had been given a quote of $3100 to get the repairs done at the transmission place I had my vehicle towed from. Then I was told a new transmission would be installed and there was nothing could be done to help me out on the repair cost. My vehicle was repaired there and the transmission only went two yrs and 7 months and 60000 miles. So I went and gave the OK on the repairs because my vehicle was there already and I need my car repaired.  After picking  up my vehicle and driving home the transmission started having problems again. That's coming from a new transmission according to my service advisor .

Maybe that‚Äôs just me. But either way Terry was entirely transparent! He told me exactly what was up with the truck, the good bad an ugly.

Then when we got to a price on my trade in (which didn‚Äôt bone me, it was honestly more than I thought it was worth) and a monthly payment he said he was willing to hold the truck a week until I could get in town to check it out, he even took it off the internet!

On top of that, this truck had some gnarly cool (and expensive) mud tires. They still had a decent chunk of tread on them. But TERRY?! My main squeeze TERRY?! He said no. Not good enough. New freaking tires. No cost. He would not sell a subpar vehicle, especially to a military man. I came in a week later, and everything he told me over text, he stuck to. No gimmicks, no BS. Terry Layman is the man, he will hook you up with a vehicle that works, you can afford, and will leave you with a smile. Good sh*t. Terry, Huffines was great. Would buy from them again.",5.0

After dealing over the phone with the different salesman I decided to go with Huffines. It had been a long time since I dealt with a car salesman and it has definitely changed over the last 25 years. I'm not use to dealing over the phone. Needless to say I guess I'm happy but not  use to the higher payments but I'm glad I got the truck I wanted. Scott Bradley was the salesman and he was very accommodating and also the finance lady (Rachael) was great and very helpful. I appreciate both of them in making the transaction smooth.

I backed the vehicle up 10 minutes after I left the dealership and the brakes squeeked. I would think that even if you can‚Äôt replicate it maybe check the brakes anyway? I wouldn‚Äôt make this up.

But after a couple weeks of limited to no response, I decided it is not good to continue working with them.  I searched the Internet around the DFW area and came across Huffines.  I remember watching their TV ads a long while back.  Did not know they are a very large dealership selling brands other than Chrysler.

I reached out to Huffines via facebook that led me to Surya Bhasin who is one of the internet salesperson.  He was very courteous and worked with me to find the 2019 Journey GT I was looking for.  There was no sales gimmicks and pressuring for options.  He gave me exactly what I was wanting and we closed the deal in 15-20 minutes.  Also worked with Bill Brand to complete and pay for the car and provided me valuable information on extended warranty options.  Most enjoyable sales experience I had.  

I have yet to use their actual service center for any needs but will update my experience when it is time to bring in the Journey for its scheduled maintenance.

522,"July 28, 2019","Hands down a great car buying experience.  Read my Frisco Jeep review to see how I ended up here.  It‚Äôs a good read, I promise!

After calming down from Frisco, I was contacted by JOHN SHEPPARD and he sent a very sincere email that caught our attention.  I called Huffines to ask about warranty prices during my Frisco fiasco and the last thing that rep told me ‚ÄúHuffines will take care of you‚Äù.  I called John and set up an appointment and he quickly found something to start with that fit my criteria.  He worked hard even through the night and I respect that.  üëäüèº

My wife and I showed up on time and took a quick glance at the lot before John came out to greet us.  I told him about my trade in prior and he said ‚Äúwhere‚Äôs your trade in?‚Äù

My wife and I had our guard up and made sure we didn‚Äôt bring the trade in and we told him we were not making any deals today and that we‚Äôd sleep on what we saw today.  Not once did he show a change in attitude and he said cool bro, here‚Äôs what I wanted to show you.

Test drove a fairly used Jeep and told me to get some speed on the highway and chatted about the Jeep as well as got to know us and what we liked.  Said he‚Äôd remain quiet so we could speak about the Jeep and then returned to the lot.  He never tried to persuade us to go inside the showroom or ‚Äúsell‚Äù us on anything.  Told us that he‚Äôd send us some other potential models later that evening while my wife and I went to dinner and parted ways.  

We genuinely liked his professionalism and told him that we wanted to increase the budget a little to see what else he could find, even into older model Saharas.  He found three and we arranged to meet him in the morning, told me that he worked the later shift starting at noon but had no problem coming in at 10am.  We appreciated that.

He had three on the lot the next morning but I spotted one that was a little past my budget and said I wanna look at this one.  2018 Wrangler Unlimited JL with S package, literally had everything we needed plus additional upgrades for the same price as the Frisco potato.  All we wanted was power locks and it upper cutted us with a set of 2 with the power of Jesus starting it remotely.  (Shout out to my wife for holding her emotions inside)

Test drive complete, I told John I wanted to start the process and give him my trade in keys, just shut up and take my money!  They were very inviting during the whole process, didn‚Äôt scam me once with numbers.  Presented the trade in value of $6,000 which was very generous and the director even dropped the sticker price to $34,988 because HUFFINES TAKES CARE OF THEIR CUSTOMERS!  Frisco you hear that????

I told them that I already had my pre approved loan and he asked if he could get a stab at beating it, I said what the heck why not.  I guess my credit score was 780 so they slapped me in the face with 3.89%... Frisco you hear that??  They took care of me.

At the end of the day, I left with a loan of under $40,000 which was my goal and these guys were very pleasant.  I had mentioned that those all weather mats were nice but I‚Äôd look on amazon (my Jeep didn‚Äôt have any during the test drive).

As a final cherry on top and nobody even taking the credit, someone snuck all of the floor mats into the Jeep.  A gesture as small as that really overwhelmed us and we will surely buy my next Jeep here.

Side note, I rate the latrine 5/5 for cleanliness, visual appeal, plenty of good smelling So App

Approval rating:
John Sheppard 50/50
Huffines Reputation Upheld 30/30

They made me feel welcome and took the time to talk about what I was really looking for in a new truck.  Admittedly I had done a ton of research before making my purchase.  I also had the opportunity to talk with Oscar, Rachel and Ray from Huffines Design shop.  They too were also very patient and professional and took time to go over the specific customizations I was interested in adapting to my new truck.  The staff was very considerate.  My only concern was the length of time it took to close the deal.  It was three and a half hours....which was about two and a half hours longer than I wanted to be there.  All in all, I got what I wanted at a decent price and worked with a really nice sales staff.",4.8

529,"July 25, 2019","Our family has purchased 9 vehicles in 20 years from Huffines, specifically from Darrell Smithey. Working with Huffines has always been a great experience. Darrell has always treated us like gold, he is honest and kind, and goes above and beyond to make sure you're taken care of long after the day you purchase a vehicle. I'm so glad to know Darrell and truly appreciative of his kindness over the years.
 
This most recent visit was the first time I needed to bring a car in for more than maintenance. Mother Nature flooded the engine and caused some other damage to my Charger. The insurance company responded with a very disappointing appraisal of the damage, they initially were only going to pay for about 50% of the damage.
 
I spoke with Darrell and he referred me to Paul Aceto, who dealt with the insurance company from that point on. Paul made sure the insurance company took care of me and also saw to it that my car was given back to me in top-notch condition. I've had the car back for nearly 2 months now and the new engine runs beautifully! I'm so glad to have my car back, and in such wonderful condition, but it was always a pleasure to talk with Paul throughout the process. Thanks to everyone who worked on my Charger, I couldn't be happier with the end result!",5.0

He arranged for me to bring my truck back in immediately and have the dent guy fix it. But the door came back looking worse than before. He set it up with the body shop and had the door replaced in which I drove a loaner set up by him.  The day the truck return from the shop, the weather was bad with pouring down rain.

548,"July 15, 2019","We are from Northeast Arkansas and found the vehicle we liked online at Huffines Chrysler Dodge Jeep In Lewisville Texas that serves the Dallas-Fort Worth area.  We contacted Josh at Huffines and began getting information about our vehicle with him over the phone.  Throughout our entire process, we could tell that Josh was a person with an extensive amount of experience and had the skills that were needed to help us, which was displayed through his knowledge, professionalism and courtesy.  He showed honesty, integrity, and we never felt pressured to make a decision.  After making a decision, we began our 10 hour drive to Huffines.  Upon our arrival, meeting Josh in person was a great experience.  He represented himself, and the Huffines dealership group, as well in person as he did over the phone. He had our purchasing vehicle ready to drive off the lot, which included a very clean detail job, a full tank of gas, and was ready to show me all the new features my vehicle had to offer.  Every detail Josh had given us over the phone was appropriate and accurate.  Josh treated us with the feeling as if we were the only persons on the lot.  He had taken all the proper measures ahead of time to ensure that our time spent doing the paper work was quick and accurate.  Again, If you would like information about a vehicle and don‚Äôt want to feel pressured, I recommend you calling and speaking with Josh.  He was able to give us such a great deal, it was worth the 10 hour drive to Huffines.  They will stand behind what they tell you.  Thank you Josh, your services are much appreciated.  ",5.0

After messing with it for about 15 minutes they tell me i have to get a new windshield.  Yes,  the issue was rear view mirror and i have to get a whole new WINDSHIELD because the ""glue melted"". As I'm getting ready to leave because i declined the service,  i expect them to give me the vehicle either in the same condition or better if no service was done. When i get the vehicle back the rear view mirror is hanging. Not on the windshield how i had it when i came in.  So they tell me they can't get it in the same way because the glue melted due to the heat and expect me to drive without a rear mirror. *guess what not my problem, if your job is to sell people service that their vehicle does not need,  just stick to that and quit trying to fix problems you don't know how to fix* Well i did drive without a rear view mirror,  drove straight to a chevy dealer next door and got a new truck the same night!",1.2

When Surya Bhasin called to see if he could help, I explained my frustration and he said to just come in and about how Huffines doesnt do that. Sure enough, no crazy fees, no haggling, no hard selling, no bait and switch, no suprises, just simple transparency.

Where I fall short is usually finding a dealer sale person that I click with and find super helpful.

He went out of his way to help show me pictures before I drove out to his site, he listened to me, and he answered all questions honestly and clearly. He knows what a car buyer is thinking and is transparent in the sales process. He is what you would hope any dealer sales person should be.

When I saw the jeep for sale at Huffines I immediately reached out to Terry Layman, who promptly replied to me. Within an hour we were talking and were very close to closing the deal when another salesperson came into the room with him and announced that the jeep had just sold. It wasn't the firs time this had happened, so I said thanks and moved along. 

When I came out of a meeting the next morning I had phone voicemails, text messages and emails from Terry. The deal on the jeep had fallen through and he knew I wanted it so he did all he could do to get my attention. I called him and said put my name on it... then I made the 3 hour trip to get my new ride. The jeep was in immaculate condition, cleaned and polished with a full tank of gas.

From totaling my beautiful 2017 Jeep Renegade to being ridiculously oversold on a base Tucson from a very shady Hyundai dealership, I was so drained and stressed from worrying about cars I honestly didn't know what to do.

After explaining my hardships to Surya--the same salesman who sold me Pikachu (my Renegade) less than two years ago--I was relieved to see he was still the same helpful and knowledgable guy I remembered.  I should've started my search for a new car at Huffines.  At least I'm a person who learns from my mistakes!  Surya wasted no time trying to upsell me things out of my budget.  He recommended I try a pre-owned, and that's how I came across the beautiful 2018 Kia Sportage I drove off the lot just a few hours later.  He and Jeff were not only friendly, but honest and didn't once make me feel like I was getting swindled.  Racheal was also a total sweetheart and even filled up my gas tank before I left.

I asked how long he said they didn‚Äôt know and would leave the ticket open and call me when it comes in.

909,"January 30, 2019","Last week I went in for an oil change. Asked if they could look at my alignment again because the last time they did it, I drove off and it was doing the same thing and the manager confirmed that it was still pulling to the right. (After test driving it while I was in the car.) I got my oil changed and then they said I should schedule to come in for the alignment issue. So they said they needed about 2 hrs since I had a wrangler and only have to work on the front wheels. We chose Wednesday. (He said Monday‚Äôs are busy). This morning I got there thinking it would take 2 hours I brought my computer and started working. Minutes later I was told that they didn‚Äôt want me to have to wait around and since this issue is covered under warranty they would give me a rental. I wasn‚Äôt happy with the rental (because it wasn‚Äôt a wrangler instead it was a mini Cherokee). I was then insured it would be finished by 3pm.  At 2 pm I got a phone call saying it wouldn‚Äôt be ready today. I asked what was wrong? They said they are backed up. Mind you I drive around town as part of my work duties. So then they said we should know something tomorrow by 10am. So I had to go back there to get my children‚Äôs car seats out and garage opener. i spoke with the manager when I got there to express my dissapointment that my car was not completed today as I had been told it would. His response was unacceptable (to me). He explained that they get backed up and I shouldn‚Äôt tie them to a tight time frame and I should expect to have to wait 2 days because they have 180ish cars to servive. (Mind you they told me how long it would take: 1st 2 hours, then by the end of the day). He went on to say that he had put my car in front of 25 other cars as if he was doing me a favor. Then reminded me that it had been a while since I first had had the alignment looked at. (Again as if it was my fault and I had already explained to them personal/medical reasons why it had taken so long for me to return. Not acknowledging the fact that I was told after it was worked on the first time that something wasn‚Äôt done right. When I came in last week I wasn‚Äôt expecting anything free but was told they would make it right).  I then asked him how is that good customer service. Then he blamed others for telling me a time frame. Never once apologized and accepted responsibility. I asked if I could keep my place in line and when they were working on the car in front of mines if I could bring my car back within 15 mins of the call. He went around this question by saying something that could take 2 hours might take 4. He said one of his techs stays until 6pm and May be able to look at it tonight but work wouldn‚Äôt be don‚Äôt till tomorrow. I also asked what was the purpose of scheduling an appointment if they wouldn‚Äôt even look at my car that day. He then asked why didn‚Äôt I leave my car there last week. I explained that I wasn‚Äôt given that portion and it would be better to schedule. (He has no response for that) The whole time we had this conversation he seemed irritated by the fact that I was holding them accountable. I understand things happen and at least the service provider was nice, respectable and showed empathy and was trying to find solutions for me. (I also understand that he is limited in what he can do to help me). The manager on the other hand was cold and blamed others including myself. On another note if the warranty company is paying for the rental while my car is being repaired, I‚Äôm not so sure that they would be happy to know that they paid for a loaner car, and the first day 8:30-4:30 (Probably wasn‚Äôt looked at, at all) my car wasn‚Äôt even looked at. So now I wait until tomorrow at 9:30am for them to call me and tell me what the problem is with my car. (I was also told it should be finished by 10am tomorrow). I feel like I would have been better off staying there to wait, maybe they would have at least looked at it. ",1.0

Before ever stepping foot onto the lot, the general manager sent a few cars listing their attributes.  Upon receiving them, they invited me to come in and Terry presented the 2018 Jeep Compass of my dreams.  

I was sent the upfront, true no haggle price and once I arrived test drove the vehicle.  They provided a full Carfax detail and I feel like Terry and the team at Huffines went above and beyond my expectations.  The general manager spoke to me first removing all pressures to buy.  Terry spent quite a bit of time with me and even their finance team was very informative and easy to understand.  This being my first car purchase, I can't thank the entire team enough for such a positive experience.  I will be referring more of my friends and family to Huffines for the unmatched level of service.

Surya said they could get it.  Well they located one really quickly but it was a demo with 2500 miles on it.  I said I didnt want a demo so we went to another truck.  Another truck came up and the dealer trade just couldnt be made but this was after Surya told me it was secured.   Then a 3rd vehicle came up.  The trade was done yet the day I was supposed to go in and sign it was told me to that this was a demo.  The salesperson took no blame for this is issue at all.

The only part where I'd improve, is the lease cost, which was not fair, taking in account my position and company, as well as my earnings, but that was the Jeep finance company that didn't take in acocunt the right factors, even where Ruben and Dave insisted on it. 

It's not on the rate that they request, but on the respect they give to the end customer, which disturbs me. If Dave and Ruben support wouldn't be there, I wouldn't lease the car from Jeep, due to the reasons explained, and that wouldn't be my first time in US.

1087,"April 16, 2018","I recently bought a 4-door Jeep Wrangler from Surya at Huffines in Lewisville.  I must say it was the best experience I've ever had in buying a new car.  Surya was not only knowledgeable, but extremely patient with me and all my questions.  I am a 66-year old grandma and this is my 2nd Jeep.  I was very particular about all the options, and of course even the color of my new Jeep.  Surya worked very hard to ensure all my needs were met.

The best part of working with Surya is that even after purchase he has been very helpful with additional questions and he follows up to make sure I'm happy with my purchase.  

As a footnote, I'd also like to add that working with Jeff, the Finance Manager was super fun!  You will just have to sit in Jeff's office someday to see what I mean!  He was also terrific, and found me a great financing deal!

I highly recommend visiting the people at Huffines for great service and the best selection of Jeeps around.

We had the pleasure of first meeting J.T. who was very patient and polite from the very beginning. We were recommended to David Webb but J.T. was so wonderful and sympathetic to a couple facing a wedding in the coming months that we couldn't resist the charm and stuck with him.
J.T. walked us through options and was very detail oriented. He was super helpful in keeping to my requests such as price range and must haves. He stayed in touch with me until I came back a few days later and I pointed out a truck I saw on their website that had just been put up that week. J.T. did his research and was able to show us that day. 
With the help of Vincenzo and J.T. we were able to come up with a GREAT DEAL for my trade in and finance the truck at an unbeatable rate. Vincenzo and his colleague Bill made us feel like we were receiving the family discount treatment. Bill also got me a hitch for my truck as a bonus so I can move the materials to build our dance floor for the wedding. The patience and understanding of our position made it possible for me to drive out with a beautiful four door 2013 certified pre-owned Dodge Ram 1500.  
Vincenzo even made it a point when he test drove with us over to the finance dept to personally speak with Ruben. Vincenzo was clear to make sure we were taken care of. Ruben was polite and clear about what to expect and what options we had. He was funny and helped take the anxiety from signing a 72 month contract.

1129,"January 17, 2018","We called Jeep Lewisville after getting frustrated with a rival dealership regarding ordering a Jeep. We knew exactly what we wanted and it didn't exist on dealer lots anywhere in the area because it was so specific. We were tired of salespeople trying to convince us that we wanted a Jeep already on their lot. No....we had just bought a 2016 a year and half earlier and knew exactly what we were looking for in our new 2018 Jeep purchase. 

From our perspective, we could not have made this any easier for the salesperson at the rival dealership. It was a guaranteed sale for a new 2018 Jeep towards the end of the year served on a silver platter and they simply did not reply to our emails or calls multiple times so we looked elsewhere and saw the excellent reviews Jeep Lewisville had. We called and were connected with Nabil who could not have been easier to work with. He understood how straightforward this sale was from the beginning. If we could've ordered the new Jeep online from Amazon, we would have. We stopped by the dealership, Nabil ordered the Jeep we wanted and we left about 20 minutes later. The Jeep arrived earlier than expected, we lined up our paperwork through some quick emails back and forth and were driving off the lot with our new Jeep in just under an hour.

This is how car buying should be. No hassles, no gimmicks, no trying to convince us we want a different Jeep even after we'd clearly stated otherwise multiple times. 

Jeff in finance go the idea that we wanted to be in and out pretty quick. He didn't pressure us although I was anticipating otherwise just based on past experiences. Nabil and Jeff stayed late at work to finalize the sale and the gates were closed to the lot when we left. It was all that our work schedule allowed and they were very accommodating.

Again, thank you for a positive car buying experience and making it as easy as it should be.",4.8

He immediately responded  that he understood and would widen his search to find what I wanted within my budget. Within a few hours I had 3 good choices and after picking the one I wanted, he worked with his management to match an unbelievably low price I'd been quoted at another dealer. He ordered the transfer of the vehicle from Oklahoma and I went into the dealership to meet him, test drive a 2018 Jeep Cherokee Limited, learn about the features and functions, and ""meet"" the dealership.

1135,"January 03, 2018","Contacted several Jeep dealerships seeking a specific model of a Jeep renegade.  Was sent a email with a picture of the model I was looking for, so I called and set up an appointment.  Upon arriving I was not shown the Renegade that was shown in the email sent to me, but the sales person (Cary Murillo) listened to what I wanted and provided a similar model having the specifications I desired.  This is where things changed when it was learned that this was the Renegade I was interested in purchasing.   The process dragged out way too long taking almost 3 hours to purchase a Renegade for cash minus a trade in.  The trade in was a one owner vehicle with a clear title with no liens, had been excellently maintain by a dealership with all scheduled maintenance and was checked by that dealership just prior to this transaction.  The sales rep had to got to the manager to get the offer for the trade in and returned with a figure that was 1/3 of even a dealership trade in value.  When it was apparent that this figure was unacceptable and unrealistic to me, I was told that the manager ""didn't like the way the engine sounded""; but was also told the manager wasn't a mechanic.  The sales rep went back to the manager  and came back with an offer that was twice what was originally offered (this involved thousands of dollars).  It took less than 30 minutes to me to decide to buy the Renegade and most of the time spent waiting involved offers for the trade in.  If I had not already done my homework on the value of my trade in, I would have been out a lot of money to fatten the profit already being made upon me.  I have purchased many vehicles in my life and have faced this before as this is a well known ""car salesman"" tatic that people hate and fear.  Make extra money off the customer because they may not know what the trade-in value is and use some lame easy to back out of excuse for the first offer if the customer balks, and delay the whole process so the customer will get tired and agree to any offer just to get the whole process over with.  Good sales practice to increase profits, but has one bad side effect...You just showed the customer that you are trying to rip him off and makes the customer feel that he can't trust you to make a fair deal.  Makes the customer wonder what else in this deal are you pull and definitely brings out ""buyer beware"".  Definitely the trust is gone, and I didn't believe anything else said or excuses made to me after that.  The deal I finally agreed on still allowed the dealership to make a handsome profit on the trade-in as well as the sale, but it was what I expected. 
 I'm not against a dealership making a decent profit, but to try to rip the customer for more not only didn't get the more they wanted and lost the trust of the customer....doesn't sound like a good, long term business model to me.  Is it just in the sales department or does this tactic apply to their service department too by telling the customer he needs service that he really doesn't.  I won't find out as I will find another dealership for the service I need.  I will not purchased anything else from here and will tell all that I know to avoid this place that practices the old ""check with the manager game"".  I also hate the ""if you can't give us a 10 on reviews let us fix it"" game....you can't fix an attempt to rip the customer off.  Even if withdrawn, it still kills the trust.  I gave this review 2 stars not for the sales, but for large selection of vehicles in stock.   ",2.2

1174,"November 04, 2017","To make a long story short, I had a way too specific idea of what I wanted in my first Jeep. It was clear that finding it was not going to be easy. I searched many markets and wide distances with no avail. 

My girlfriend (and fellow Jeep owner) and I were in working with Ruben, who was addressing a separate issue for us. I was impressed with his sense of urgency in personally seeing to it that our concern was taken care of expediently. It was much appreciated. 

Naturally, as we waited, I gravitated towards the Jeeps. My conversation with Stewart started at that point with available options and ideas. Then I humored him with my eclectic idea of the options and packages I was out to get. He was not pushy or aggressive, just informative. 

Not only did Stewart somehow manage to locate my unique (understatement) Jeep, he proactively acquired it from another local dealership so I could see it in person. Then he was very patient through the negotiations as I decided how I wanted to handle the purchase. Stewart was very fair and Customer-centric. I'd certainly buy another car from Stewart.

Then it was time to make it all official. Jeff had taken care of my girlfriend's Jeep purchase as well, so I knew I was working with a professional who was genuinely invested in his Customer's best interests. This was no exception and Jeff did not disappoint.

Nice work, gentlemen! I thank you for my Jeep!

My huffines didn't go so well in the beginning and honestly it left me never wanting to step foot in a dealership again. I waited almost 6 months to post a quick review explaining what happened. I get a response from the Gm, most post do if they are bad, and I ignored it. Where huffines is different is Steve didn't my non response lightly, he kept checking in asking if I had a min and finally I gave in. Every business has a bad apple or 2 but when the boss owns up, takes it personal, and goes the extra mile to undo what's been done. That's says volumes about how he values the dealership over any one sale or transaction. This sounds so corny but it's just so rare someone is helpful, when getting nothing in return.

Using the USAA car buying app, my wife and I where brought into contact with Terry Layman who offered his services in a no pressure conversation. Over the 5-10 minute conversation with Terry over the phone, he preemptively asked if I wanted to meet him somewhere close to my residence to test drive the vehicle (understanding our busy work schedule right off the bat). We met at a close location with our kids and in a no pressure setting, he ran me through the specifics of the vehicle ending in a test drive. Blown away by the customer service and the quality of the vehicle my wife and I decided to buy the vehicle.

I was about ready to get a new vehicle anyway so I contacted Huffines via their website.  David Jones responded promptly but, before he threw out prices to my general inquiry, he contacted me by phone to determine exactly what my needs and preferences were.  Within a few hours he had located a vehicle that fit my needs and shortly thereafter we agreed to the deal.  The vehicle was ready for me as promised when I returned to the DFW area.  David took a lot of time to explain features of my new Jeep Cherokee Limited and then went way above and beyond to assist me.  I have driven the Jeep for a few days now and love it.

Stewart explained the financing options so well that when we headed over to sign the paperwork it was a breeze!

1374,"November 02, 2016","Took my Dodge Charger in for the recall and had some issues, as well. 2015 model and I explain that the cruise control, when you hit resume, always goes 5-6 miles over what is set, and then slows done to the programmed speed. The A/C blows cool air when on normal, but this is Texas, so I usually have it on A/C High.Parking foot brake doesnt hold the car from rolling back. They have my car for 4 days and when I pick it up, the only thing on the list done, was the recall. They did a software update so assume that it fixed the cruise control. The A/C, well it's fine, meets the norm. The parking foot brake, sure it rolls back once applied, but the mechanic tells me,""Parking brakes are only intended to keep a vehicle from rolling forward, not backwards"". Really. So I'm not happy, so they bring the mechanic forward to go on a test drive with me. He's not a Happy Camper, assuming because it's close to Miller Time. Take a drive and the cruise control works fine. Ok, I feel stupid. The A/C issue, well, keep it on High then, I'm told by the mechanic. I'm really irritated now and explain that on high, the A/C circulates the inside air only and that after a while, less oxygen to breathe and it starts to smell funny. Again, the norm. Now the parking brake issue. When the mechanic says his spiel on only for rolling forward, I look at him and say,""So, since my driveway is at a slant, I can only back up the driveway because of how the parking brake is designed?"". Ready for the kicker, ""Yes"" that is what Fiat tells us.Must be true then. I used to drive a Chevy and went to their sister lot for Chevys, and here, never an issue.

1382,"October 23, 2016","I am writing this review to share my most recent car buying experience. I had been looking to purchase a Jeep Wrangler unlimited for several months. I wanted to do my research and make sure that I was purchasing a vehicle that most owners had been happy with. I also wanted to know if there had been any bad owner experiences to consider into my purchase decision. I finally decided on the Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Sport, 24 S package with Automatic transmission., Upgraded 17 in wheels and tires. I visited my previous dealership where I purchased my Heep Cherokee. Needless to say, that experience was very disappointing and left me feeling devalued. They didn't seem to care about my repeat business and the fact that my credit would qualify me for special consideration on Jeep brand advertised offers. I again did my research and figured the payments to be within my budget for a Lease option. When I began to discuss my particular payment and other factors of being able to agree to buy, they came back with some ridiculous payment amount and that I would have to put a whole lot of money down to get to the payment I wanted. They then tried to put me in a different type of Jeep that according to them, would work for my budget. I left the dealership feeling disappointed and frustrated.. 

I had also contacted a sales person at Huffines Jeep in Lewisville. I had postponed doing business here because I thought I should give Classic of Denton an opportunity to earn my repeat business. Boy.. Was I wrong about that.   I then waited until I slept on it and called Justin Dimpson the next morning. I asked Justin if he still had the Jeep I had asked about earlier in the week and asked him a few questions about a Leade purchase on this vehicle. He told me that what I was asking for was quite possible and in fact, not an issue as it had been at Classic of Denton. He had two different Jeep models in the color I wanted waiting for me when I arrived that morning. 
From the moment I drove up, Huffines Jeep Dodge Chrysler rolled out the red carpet and made me feel like I was the only customer that mattered. Justin was superb at answering all of my questions and allowing me to take the Jeep I wanted to show my wife so we could decide on it together. We both returned to the dealership and they had taken additional amounts off of  my trade and in addition, another 1500 off of the Wrangler. My payments  and lease terms were within the range I had previously tried to get Classic to do. I also was made to feel that my superior credit was something to be proud of. All of the sales people and business office staff were very professional and showed me that Huffines is interested in giving their customers  a completely different car buying experience. I have nothing but praise for everyone at Huffines Jeep in Lewisville! I know have the Jeep Wrangler I wanted and am a very satisfied customer!!",5.0

1401,"August 29, 2016","I came to this dealership after them being highly recommended by one of their mechanics that I knew from the gym. He said they are very thorough with their used cars and if there is something wrong they fix everything on it. Being that they are a large automotive group, I asked if they would  get a car from another lot if I wanted it. They vehicle I wanted was at their Plano location, but they told me I didn't qualify for it. Because I was coming out of a BK, they said that only their location had the relationship with the necessary banks to get me approved. So instead they told me I could only be approved on one vehicle.  The oldest and highest mileage vehicle they had. It cost more and had more mileage than the other vehicle I wanted. But since I was having to give up my vehicles any day at this point, I really had no choice. I waited about 30 days to see if they would get anything else in and they kept telling me there is nothing that I qualify for but this car. So of course I end up getting it, only to find out that they sold me a vehicle that had been in an accident and NEVER even told me about it. Don't buy from this dealership without thoroughly having it checked out by your PERSONAL mechanic. I wouldn't send my mother to this dealership. The dealership claims that their resolutions are adequate yet I had to involve an attorney and they have felt the need to file and actual lawsuit. So obviously they just continue to lie. As for claims that I waited 2 years to inform them of the issue, I informed them the moment there became an issue and was told by 3 different mechanics and 2 General managers 15 months after having purchased the vehicle that it was in an accident. Not too mention then general managers claims that the vehicle passed their rigorous safety inspections, yet they weren't competent enough to figure out it had been in an accident and the need to disclose this info?

I did it all on my own! Joe made it easy. He used NO pressure. He was a true gentleman and there was NEVER ANY run-a-round tactics such as taking my keys of my car, ""let me ask the manager"" or any sitting and waiting or ""stalling"" tactics that make car buying so awful. I drove out of my way a ways to this dealership because they had the car I wanted in the color/ package I was looking for and I did not regret the drive...all because of Joe. Also, I already had a pre qualification financing set up with my bank that was a great low interest loan as I had a significant down payment. Well, Huffines finance guy got me an even LOWER interest deal with FWCC.

My wife and I were greeted outside while checking out vehicles by Hamed Awadi. He greeted us in less than 2 minutes, which to me is a very big deal. I explained to Hamed I had been researching Jeep Grand Cherokees and the ""must have"" add ons I wanted. I expressed concern about price and trade in value. Hamed immediately came up with a vehicle I would be interested in and showed me the minimal cost to add on leather and new rims. With his confidence in getting me into a vehicle that day I decided to let him try. I took a test drive, picked out a few package options and told him the price I required for my trade in. HE CAME BACK TO ME WITH ALL OF THAT AND MORE!!! It took no time at all. I was given exactly what I asked for in my trade in and given a nice discount without the typical back and forth grind out. I have been a General Manager of a large retail store in the metroplex for 10 years and appreciate great customer service. Hamed listened, came up with solutions to fit my needs, and did not make me work for the deal I wanted. He just made it happen! Next I met with Jeff Bockemehl. He helped me lock in the absolute best interest rate on a new car purchase I have ever seen! I was absolutely floored. I normally do not by extended warranties, but Jeff really stood behind all the features and benefits without being pushy. He helped me work it into a monthly payment I was comfortable with and even charged my wife's dying iPhone!!! Seriously! All in all I was at this dealership just over an hour. Unheard of right?!! I mean, seriously, I have spent 3-4 hours at a car dealership only to find out the salesman could not get me what I needed but still wanted to push some ridiculous other option onto me. Not at Huffines, no sir. They treat you with respect, and care about your time and money. I would recommend Hamed and Jeff to anyone. I would also like to thank Ray in parts for helping me pick out some new after market tires for a great price. He really made that process quick and easy. I have had my car for 3 days and love it. Each morning I go into my garage I get a shock to see such a beautiful new Jeep that is all mine. Remember, I did not go in to Huffines to buy, Hamed, Jeff, and Ray made me an offer I couldn't refuse. I cannot fathom sending anyone anywhere else to buy a car.

1433,"July 03, 2016","
Started as probably the most pain free, quick and simple auto buying experiences I've ever had. I recently purchased a 2015 Ram 1500 from the their used car division. Terry Layman was very helpful and very patient. They were never pushy and never tried to convince me to buy today. Everything was on my time frame. Great communication with out any unwanted contacts. After the sale, there were a few small issues they had to take car of on the truck. They got it in, took care of everything, and got it back with everything done to my expectations. 
  Then I discovered a hail damage repair spot and a couple of small issues. I tried to communicate these things with Terry, and we exchanged a couple of e-mails & texts, but no progress. Then he stopped responding to e-mails. I assumed that they had their money and were done with me. 
  I wrote an honest descriptive review of the whole experience on Google, dropping my original good review of 5 stars down to 2. A few days later General Manager Steve Baine called me and discussed the issues. He was very surprised that Terry had dropped the ball the way he did and offered to take care of all issues. He put me in touch with Used Car Manager Greg Birdsall, who arranged a loaner truck and got all the issues addressed. 
  I've kicked my Google review and this one back up to 4 stars. The only reason it's not 5 is that the whole experience should have been handled differently from the beginning. Issues with the truck that occurred while the truck was in Huffines possession should have been brought to my attention. Terry should have taken care of his customer after the sale.
  I think, at some dealerships, there is a bit of a disconnect between the new car department and the used car department. Used cars present a unique challenge in customer service as there is a greater likelihood there will be issues after the sale. 
  I still have mixed feelings with Huffines used car department, but my thanks to Steve and Greg for stepping up to the plate and addressing the problem. I think it shows that Huffines does have a commitment to customer service, just more so at the Management level than with the used car salesmen. Ultimately, if there is a problem, they will make it right.",4.0

1437,"June 25, 2016","I contacted Huffines about a certified pre-owned truck listed on Autotrader.  I was told it was gone but there were a few others just like it.  (I know.  I know.  Why do we fall for this?)  Regardless, I spent two hours in metroplex traffic to get to this dealership and test-drove two vehicles on Friday afternoon.  

That evening I texted my intent to buy one of them‚Ä¶at the ‚Äúno hassle‚Äù asking price no less!!  At 8:45am Saturday morning the salesman called to confirm the deal and we set a pick up time.  I arranged transportation, EMAILED MY PERSONAL INFORMATION for the transaction and was hitting the road when, at 9:30 am, I received a second call from the salesman.  He informed me that ""the decision had been made to sell the vehicle to someone else""‚Ä¶because they were already there.

He said the truck was already being prepped for me when they showed it!  If a dealership is willing to sell you a ‚ÄúSOLD‚Äù vehicle that should tell you all you need to know about the value they place on commitment.  

But I should have known better.  The other vehicle I drove had almost 30% more miles on it than advertised!!!   It smelled like smoke and the  back seat was covered in DOG HAIR!!!  The salesman had no explanation but jokingly suggested that someone had taken it on a road-trip.  (FYI This truck is STILL deceptively advertised on their site AND on Autotrader as a ""certified pre-owned with 10,000 miles!)    

Wait‚Ä¶it gets better!  After getting the shaft on our ‚Äúdeal‚Äù, I was told that the truck I had originally called about was miraculously available again!!!  The salesman said ‚ÄúI guess that sale fell through or something.‚Äù  Imagine that.  The problem is that I had seen that very truck on their lot the day before and...IT HAD DEALER PLATES ON IT!!!  Of course I took note because it was supposedly ""gone"".  It is also STILL advertised as certified.  No telling how many miles the dealer has put on it.

The best part was that they said they would let me know if the sale fell through.  You know, the sale of ""MY"" truck to someone else.   LOL!  No thank you Huffines. 

It is a shame that yet another used car dealer chooses to reinforce the stereotype.

1442,"June 16, 2016","Where do I even begin?!? I live in the Fort Worth area and was in the market for a new vehicle. I knew exactly what I wanted so we started to do our research on dealerships. One dealership gave me a great deal on a 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee limited but didn't have everything I wanted but it was still a contender. I called another place that said they could get what I wanted but when I got there, the person helping me turned me over to someone else. The sales associate was extremely rude, unprofessional and wasn't listening to what I wanted. As I was waiting for him to come back with another option for me, I listened to a two minute message from Stewart at Huffines. I wasn't even considering Huffines because using a car buying app, they didn't have what I wanted. Stewart's message seemed sincere and honest and I had a good vibe about it. He was only about 15 mins away from the awful place I was currently waiting at so we headed over to Huffines to hear more of what Stewart had to say. When we got there he immediately acknowledged us and let us know he was working with someone and would be right with us. I watched as a few customers stopped in his office and could tell that they were happy with the customer service he was providing. About 20 minutes later, Stewart assisted us and LISTENED to what I wanted. He said he didn't have it there but could get EXACTLY what I wanted at another dealership. He put me in a loaner similar to what I was getting and had me drive it to make sure I'll love it. I went back and signed the paperwork with Jeff who made it so easy and didn't pressure me to add anything I didn't want but said he had to offer the products to me in which I understood.  A couple days later my vehicle was ready so I dropped off the loaner and took my new vehicle home. Out of all the places I was in contact with, Huffines gave me the BEST price for a 2016 Jeep Grand Cherokee AND it was only a grand more than what the place I was considering for a 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee! Stewart and Jeff made me feel like family. They were easily relatable and made me feel at home. Mr Huffines is very lucky to have them in the Huffines family. Thank you very much Stewart and Jeff - this experience was WELL WORTH THE 45 MINUTE DRIVE!!!",5.0

Unfortunately having to wait more than 2 hours for someone to do one of the worst jobs I've seen washing the truck sure put an unpleasant end to the experience.

They didn't have any of those cars in my price range, but Terry mentioned that they had a Jeep Compass in my budget. He was honest and not at all pushy or aggressive; my dad and I both got a good feeling from him. He was very knowledgeable about the car, and he told us all about Huffines' commitment to value and integrity. From the very beginning, we felt at ease there (which I did not expect because of hearing horror stories of used car dealerships/salesmen). He printed the Carfax for us and took us on a good test drive; it was several minutes long, and we got up to about 65mph. Terry was very personable and friendly. The purchasing process was great as well. We were handed over to Israel for the financial stuff. I expected to be there for hours, but it actually did not take long at all. The longest part was trying to get ahold of Chase bank to inquire about my loan, but I ended up financing with one of the dealership's lenders anyway because they gave me a better rate!

1470,"April 21, 2016","I have owned trucks for 25 years, a couple of Chevys but mostly Fords.  A few years ago I traded mine in for a Nissan convertible and I enjoyed it but for the last 6 months I have been craving to go back to a pickup. I have studied the internet, talked to many friends and family who own trucks.  Inevitably, the Ram pickup was mentioned, even from people who owned other brands. I casually stopped by a Nissan dealership to look at their new pickup and was completely turned off by the salesman.  So, last Saturday, I woke up, cleaned out my Nissan and hit the road, I was going to jump from dealership to dealership and test drive a few.  My first stop was Huffiness. By early evening, I was driving off the lot with a new pickup. Cary Murillo is the best car salesman I have dealt with in many years.

I called Eddie and he said let me make sure we have one that fits, he called me back in 6 minuets and said he would have it ready.

1478,"April 05, 2016","This experience went from awful to fantastic with a single phone call.
I first took my car in for a short causing the rear lights to suddenly go out without warning. I mentioned at the beginning of the conversation that I had seen this same issue on the Challenger Forums and showed him a printout where the other owner talked about the dealership finding a kinked/cut wire in the front assembly near one of the radiator mounts. After replacing other electronic parts in the car, but not checking the area I specified, they gave the car back to me after doing a few other repairs as well. While my car was there, they recommended getting some recall work done. One of these items was replacing the timing chain. They returned my car to me and I was almost rear-ended that night because the rear light issue was not fixed. I brought it back in and they found.... *gasp* a short in the front assembly where a wire was nicked near one of the radiator mounts. They repaired the short and I finally got the initial issue fixed. Two days after getting my car back the check engine light starting coming on, then would go off, then come back on. I brought my car back in as soon as I was able, to have it worked on again. After calling for 3 days and not able to get an update because when other service people looked at the notes there were not any, I finally received a voicemail message where told they would have to open the engine up. Since I saw this issue as being directly related to the recall repair they had dismantled the engine for just the week before I gave them the go ahead last Thursday morning. Now I have called Friday, Monday and today and only get voicemail. I am having to reschedule appointments and beg rides as I can since they still have my car in an unknown condition nor any hint as to a resolution or even what the issue is. So a week and a half after leaving it there, I have no idea how much longer they will have my car. I am extremely unhappy with the service and at this time will NOT recommend their service department to anyone. Then it all changed!!!!
Something I was completely not expecting happened. I was contacted by the service department manager  AND the dealership General Manager Steve Baine about the issues I had experienced. They took FULL responsibility and did not try to give me any excuses. They took care of everything, literally! I got a loaner so that I would not have to reschedule any more doctor visits, I received daily updates on the status of my car's repairs, certain costs (that the dealership controlled) were waived and they even threw in an oil change and tune-up at no cost to me as a way to say they were sorry for my earlier experience. 
I even got a follow-up a little while after my car was returned to me to make sure everything was as it should be.
I would now recommend this dealership's repair shop to others and just suggest that you be clear and precise with how you want to be updated. Speak up if you are not happy with any portion of it. They worked very hard to change my opinion and were successful.",4.0

Hamed never pressured us but instead made sure we had the information we needed and arranged for a test drive.  We told him we would be back in a month to make a final decision.   When we returned he worked hard...not to sell us what was on the lot; but what was at other details that exactly fit the options we wanted.  I chose this dealership because it was highly rated and chose Hamed because his reviews were excellent.  His performance was exactly as the reviews indicated.

I also want to point out that Izzy Barrera in Finance was equally helpful.  He was professional and courteous, making it easy to get through the paperwork by explaining all of the documents.

1499,"February 11, 2016","I know everyone probably hates buying a new car and I'm not any different (I'm probably one of the worst).  I like doing most of the work over the phone and then go in so my time at the dealership is limited.  

I worked with J.T and Nabil during my purchase.  I had already looked online to ensure they had the vehicle I wanted.  The sales team here was AMAZING.  They worked with me over the phone to answer any of my questions I had and I received absolutely no pressure to make any decisions.  I had actually been working with another dealer in the area and was getting the typical ""Come on in and we can talk"" runaround.  These guys were really accommodating and had no problem working with me over the phone to get me comfortable they would take care of me when I got there.

Once I got there, they had the new Jeep Cherokee ready for me to test drive and showed me all of the features.  I was able to drive it with no pressure to buy and when I got back, they had the paperwork I had spoken with them about over the phone sitting there waiting to review.  I was even welcomed by the manager briefly who also didn't push me to buy a vehicle.

I can't stress enough how easy this was to purchase this vehicle with no pressure whatsoever.  I felt they just wanted me to get a vehicle that I liked even if it wasn't one of theirs.  You hardly ever see that with car dealerships.  They even gave me a fair value for my trade which I thought I would have to fight over since I had already done the research on that as well.

Also, financing was a breeze.  Of course, Jeff showed me all of the options to add, but I didn't feel pressured to buy any of them.  He explained what they all were and told me what he does on his vehicle and why.  I felt like he was actually helping me choose vs telling me I needed all of the different options regardless of my driving habits or mileage I would be putting on the vehicle.  It was nice to get an explanation vs ""If you don't buy these options you will suffer a painful death ..."" that you usually get from that step in the purchase process.

Overall, if you are looking for a vehicle these guys sell, you can't go wrong with them.  They are friendly, courteous, helpful and I felt absolutely no pressure to buy.  I have to admit, being one of those guys who hate buying vehicles, this was a pleasant experience.",5.0

I ordered two new keys, and expected to pay $200 just to get one of them programmed.  But three different locksmiths were unable to do it.  So I tried Huffines Dodge in Lewisville and my problem was over.  Huffines programmed both keys and it was quite a surprise when the bill was just $30 total.  The remotes work perfectly.

He allowed us to test-drive the car by ourselves for as long as we wanted, and we noted a couple of things that were subsequently fixed before we took delivery.  Only delay was in processing the paperwork, which took about an hour, and considering that we paid cash (no financing required), that was longer than it needed to be.

1529,"November 28, 2015","Having encountered stereotypical used car salesman mentality at a several local Chrysler dealerships with sales people that really don‚Äôt know their product, I was venturing outside the metro area for my next Ram when a friend who oversees dealerships, but doesn't have a Chrysler franchise, told me that among dealers, Huffines has the best reputation for a Chrysler dealership.   I contacted Huffines and discovered that Ram discontinued my color choice 3 weeks prior, so I had to choose from dealer inventory; consequently, my vehicle was over 1000 mi away and  it made the most since to purchased my vehicle from that dealer.  Upon returning, I needed some minor body work from lot damage that the selling dealer agreed to pay for. I also had difficulty getting the vehicle enrolled in the Chrysler Business Link Program.  

David Webb has gone above and beyond what other dealerships/salesmen have done for me in the past and he has worked as hard to solve Chrysler administrative paperwork issues as if I purchased it from him. Wow. In a time when the meaning of customer service has been mostly been forgotten, it is refreshing to find someone and a dealership that conducts business the old fashioned way.

1582,"May 31, 2015",I went in because I was working with auto flex leasing on getting a Town and Country.  I was quickly approached by Dustin Austin and I explained I wanted to see a Town and Country in person and test drive to make sure I liked it.  I was very honest with him about working with another dealer and he was still extremely helpful.  After he explained all the amenities with the Town and Country and let me test drive he asked me if he could have a chance for my business too.  Having two options is never a bad thing so I told him what we were getting and what price we had in mind.  That afternoon a few hours later he called me and told me that I could get exactly what I wanted without having to give up any amenities I was going to have to give up with auto flex and for the price I wanted!  I came in the next morning along with my four year old son and they treated me so well.  Gave me a great trade in value for my Mazda CX-9 and did not haggle with prices.  He came back with the best price he could the first time!  I got a great deal on my Town and Country and my family is very happy it is like a spaceship with all the gadgets and electronics in it!  The whole time Dustin was so respectful and helpful and really listened to what I wanted and help me get exactly what I wanted for the price I wanted. Finance was a breeze too and no high pressure sales to get me to purchase any additional services.  Great experience all around and very impressed with this dealership!,5.0

To me, the test of a service operation is what happens when things aren't going as planned.  The service department did everything possible to rectify issues with my last 3500 and Steve Kloza always made sure I had a vehicle so as to not loose valuable time at the ranch.  Huffines and in particular Steve Baines went the extra mile to make sure I was happy with the deal on my new 3500.  Huffines showed me they are a dealership a business can rely on.",4.8

He worked closely with each of my sons to customize each car and they could not be happier with their new cars!  Michael even personally delivered both cars to our house going the extra mile to take care of us and make our life easier.  Now that was awesome customer service!

Wouldn't you know it they had a truck that clicked all the right boxes for me. The deal was done in a couple hours after a test drive. Both Scott Bradley and Jeff Bockemehl were great to deal with. Friendly and not pushy. The way car buying should be. And much to my surprise my used vehicle came with an updated service and a full tank of gas (well diesel fuel!)

J.T was strait forward with us and was very welcoming to my self as well as my wild child. It has been the best experience for me and my child.

1601,"April 04, 2015","It's rare these days that someone takes the time to actually listen to what you say and then uses it to help you get where you want to go.

From the very beginning starting with Clarence Pierce, he was on us like a hawk the second we pulled in, but in a very engaging and friendly way, letting us know he was there if we needed anything. That soon lead to me test driving the vehicle, and then I was ready to start looking at numbers.

While the process did take some time, I don't consider that a negative thing because I've never bought a car quickly, it takes time. However, Clarence was there offering us water and keeping us informed the entire time of exactly where in the process we were.

Once we made the deal, Clarence handed me off to Jeff Bockemehl, who was extremely friendly and also listened very closely to me. He inquired about my life and what he found out just by talking actually saved me 1500$ off the total price of the vehicle and dropped my monthly payments by about 50$ a month.

I absolutely loved my experience at Huffines Dodge, and since my brother recommended them after also having a great experience, our parents are most likely going to deal with them next year and I know if I am in the market in the future I certainly will. I plan to recommend them to everyone I hear is looking to buy a car.

A friend of mine told me to reach out Jeff Bockemehl and from the beginning, I knew something seemed different from past experiences of buying a car.  He was able to pull some strings and get the car I wanted locally and work the deal.  As well, they fixed a cosmetic item that I had barely noticed and did not even bring up as a condition of sale.  He even reached back out to me even on his day off and made sure I got in contact with Joe Koubek.  Have to be honest, I ""never"" buy the extended warranties or car care options. Working with Jeff, I realized how valuable these are especially in my specific circumstance by talking through it with him and ended up with a package that made since for my family.  
Joe Koubek was the ultimate of respectful and easy to get along with.  He was passionate about communications almost to the point of over communications and extremely respectful.  When we were leaving, he made sure to give last minute details and insight on the car.
Briefly met with Darrell Smithey and he was welcoming and assured me one of the items on my car to be rectified were forthcoming.
This team not only knows what they are doing, they make the experience enjoyable, relaxed and laid back always ensuring that your questions and concerns are addressed.

1604,"March 25, 2015","I started ""internet shopping"" for my perfect Jeep Wrangler on a Wednesday afternoon. By Friday, I had narrowed down my search to two dealerships based on those three days of interaction with various sales reps. Brett Kelley went above and beyond answering my questions and truly EARNING my business...and I'd heard that phrase a LOT in those three days. Brett was the only one who earned it and worked out a fantastic deal on my incredible new Jeep Wrangler. I went up there that Saturday to sign the line and take delivery. Brett and Craig immediately greeted me and wasted no time making sure I was completely satisfied.

I dinged one star on this due to our experience in the Finance office. Not only had I shopped Jeeps for three days, I'd also secured two solid financing options. We still went ahead with the dealer app just in case they could beat what we had lined up, but I knew in the end we should still be good. So when I sat down in Finance on a busy Saturday with the ONLY Finance guy in the house, I figured it would be smooth sailing.

It was simple. 60 months, here's my 2.X% APR I have secured. I'll entertain your better offers, but I'm not moving from these terms.

So, yes...when I was presented with a 72-month dotted line at 7.99% APR, I was a little irritated. But I don't think that an emphatic ""NO"" is a completely unreasonable response from me. I presented my already-approved Finance options to Jeff who did a complete 180 from the personable guy telling me my APR was 7.99% with 72-month terms. From then on, it was snarky remarks about ""I don't see how you're getting anything better with THOSE credit scores..."" and so-forth. So...because I don't have an 850 and still secured better financing than the BS you're showing me makes me worthless? Obviously there are bigger lenders out there who disagree with you, Jeff. I also didn't much appreciate being told that I was making the wrong choice by not just signing the deal for 72 months even if I had the intention to pay it off in 60.

Yes, we declined the additional product options. Yes, we understood that not pre-paying for our oil changes would ultimately mean we spend $30 on a premium oil change with detailing instead of $16 through the dealership. However, the snide comments about how my husband is ""obviously one of those people who don't like and aren't interested in saving money"" was totally uncalled for. 

Had we had anything but a first-class buying experience with Brett to get us this far, I would have walked out and never looked back. It was Brett who earned my business, but Jeff came very close to losing it for him. He did, however, succeed in losing a five-star review from this consumer.",4.4

This is the second time I gave David a price range and a car type to look at for one of my kids, and both times, he exceeded our expectations.

The SRT was on the floor and with these cars most dealers were selling at MSRP and not much negotiations - but to get me the note i was looking for -they worked with me. The 2015 Jeep Cherokee wasn't a need but my wife didn't want to trade in her 2012 Nissan Maxima and carry a bigger note - so to avoid a lot of driving around and dealing with salespeople - I called the dealer and spoke to Joshua who sold me my SRT and after telling him what I needed to be at on my trade in and note - he said to come in and when we arrived the vehicle was pulled out and financing was approved and in place.

I have been working with him for over a year now with services and maintenance on my wife's now old jeep liberty and my dodge Ram 1500. He is always friendly professional and gets the job done right the first time and is very quick in returning them back to us. Because of this awesome experience we decided to stay with Huffines for the purchase of our new vehicle. We met With Joe and inquired about a 2014 Durango limited. We came in and kicked some tires back in December 2014 and had such a great experience with Joe that we came back in Feb 2015 and bought our 2014 Durango Limited. He is very open and honest and friendly which made it one of the best and easiest car buying experiences I have ever had. When we were in financing with Jeff he worked very hard to give us the best rate and keep us within our monthly budget. So long story short, Huffines is the best in the business in my opinion from service to sales to financing that I have ever seen and experienced.

1637,"December 01, 2014","To be honest I stopped first at Classic Dodge in Denton, needless to say I'm surprised it was NOT a good experience. A matter a fact I it almost turned me off from even considering to purchase a new vehicle. My daughter-in-law had purchased a vehicle from Huffines in Lewisville and called Kim Phillips and told her what I was looking for. Kim then got with Nabil Seyam who has sold my daughter-in-law her car.  They worked as a team and found me a car in all aspects of what I was looking for, Honestly I went to Huffines dreading another experience like I had at Classic in Denton. But I was amazed how easy it was... My finance officer was Izzy Barrera and he was great. So I have to say between Kim, Nabil and Izzy and all their joint effort turned my buying experience a pleasure. I would highly recommend Huffines to all my family, friends and strangers. Thank you Huffines and your outstanding team!",5.0

1639,"November 16, 2014","Nabil S. and Jeff B. were most pleasant to interact with for my truck purchase. I came from Houston, Texas to pickup a truck as my regular local dealer could not locate Houston-based inventory. We discovered the right truck at Huffines - and instead of doing a dealer trade, I came up to Lewisville to buy it out right. I am glad I did. I communicated with Nabil through email and he was incredibly responsive - and never pressured me for what he thought I wanted; only asking what I wanted or needed. The buying process was smooth and Jeff B. was able to arrange all the financing quickly and effortlessly. I would highly recommend! And yes, the truck and the buying experience were worth the 8-hour round trip commute!",5.0

While dealing with Terry Layman on the truck, I mentioned that some day, I would like to surprise my husband with his dream car, a Cadillac CTS.  Long story short, that day I DID surprise my husband with a CTS, and Terry and Johnny Ray helped make it happen!  I am very happy with my entire experience dealing with these two gentlemen. Great customer service and communication... highly recommend!",4.8
1641,"November 05, 2014","First off, see Basel Abbas. He is the greatest car salesman I have ever had the pleasure of dealing with. His best quality was hearing what I needed in a new vehicle and exceeding my needs and expectations. I did not get the vehicle I came to the dealership to get but walked away with a better one that met my needs more than I thought. The pricing is unbeatable there and everyone I talked to was happy to be working there and helping their customers. I really appreciate everything about the dealership and do not plan to buy another vehicle anywhere else. ",5.0
1642,"November 02, 2014","I believe the price I paid for a demo truck was way too high.  Truck had 4800 miles on it, had been on the road for over a year (based on inspection sticker), and after I found the window sticker (folded & shoved deep in the glove box), I found out I only got $4K off the window sticker price. VERY disappointing given current TV commercials showing $12K off MSRP for 2014 RAM 1500s.
David Jones drove it home for me, then I put it in the garage. I then went out of town for three days. Upon my return, Driver's side rear tire was flat. ",2.0

However Nabil at Huffines has hands down made my Huffines experience a great one. He went out of his way to locate and get the vehicle I was requesting. He even set me up with Carlos Diaz in the auto design & performance center with all my extra requests to go on my Jeep. 
 If you are looking for a great honest salesman look for Nabil. And any questions on aftermarket/performance parts talk to Carlos. You can't go wrong with either one of the two gentlemen.

1646,"October 11, 2014","Recently I had an appointment to have my Ram checked for a defective fuel valve. The truck was delivered before the appointment time and was told that I would get a call when it had been checked out and that the part would have to be ordered. Late afternoon I was told that they were not able to look it over and that it would be the first in the door the next morning. I was expecting my truck back that first night, as it was my wife's and my anniversary and we had a night out scheduled and no transportation. I was not offered a rental till they told me that they would have to have it a second night. All told, they had the vehicle three days and two nights. We were inconvenienced considerably.  ",1.4
1647,"October 09, 2014","This is the sixth Ram pick-up I have had since the body-style change in the mid 1990's.  The last two were purchased at Huffines, all because of the service dept.  Your service is second to none
and the guys in new vehicle sales, especially Hamad and Izzy really bent over backwards to make
this sale as smooth as possible.  As long as things at Huffines stay like they are now, I will never
buy another vehicle anywhere else.  I stopped by late in the afternoon  and said, this is what I want,
in about an hour Hamad said your truck will be here about noon tomorrow.  That's how you shop
for a truck.  Izzy did what he does best, and I'm a happy camper.

They had a different price for the vehicle on autotrader that had expired but was still listed so they gave me an extra 1000 for my trade-in. They gave me the car clean and with full tank of gas.

1654,"September 13, 2014","Once again, Huffines has delivered a superior product, quality, and top notch customer service. After being a customer of Huffines for over 10 years, that should sum it all up. When you find a dealership with a team like this, sales, finance, and service, you look no further.

Our salesman, Bill Brand is amazing. His ""no pressure"" down to earth and realistic approach is what everyone wants in a car salesman. He does everything possible to make it happen, and he does.

The finance team is great to work with too. Most potential vehicle buyers dread after making the deal having to go into the finance office and get pressured to buy extended warranties or add ons,, well not at Huffines. They just simply explain your options to you, the benefits you would or wouldn't get, and you make the decision, no pressure. For example, I just bought a 2014 Dodge Viper, an amazing super car. I was offered numerous additional plans, for example, extended warranty, paint protection, etc. There were certain things I did want to add for protection and they ""customized"" a plan to fit my exact needs.. So I was able to get the extended warranty, maintenance service plan, and the wheel and tire protection. PERFECT, exactly what I wanted, and all at a very reasonable price.

I can't forget to mention Steve Baine in management. You will not find another manager more committed to his customers satisfaction, from the very beginning, to the end of your purchase, and even beyond.  I can't say enough about the entire team at Huffines, but here are a couple very special ""shout outs""  Jeff Bockemehl, Darrell Smithey, Steve Baine, Izzy Barrera, Bill Brand, David Cox, Craig Given, Bill Matson, and good ole Johnny Ray !!!!!

My past experiences with other dealerships haven't gone as smoothly and I always felt like I was babysitting the salesman and doing their job for them.  This was not the case with Ron and Jeff.  The car was ready, as was the paperwork and I didn't have to wait too long to sign and drive off! I liked that Jeff went over the optional warranty and service plans with me but did not try to oversell the product.  Needless to say, my son was absolutely thrilled with his surprise car!

1661,"August 18, 2014","I first talked with Terry about trading in my 2011 3500 DRW on a new 2014 3500 DRW with air suspension. We came up with a deal and ordered the truck expecting it to take a month or so to come in. He always communicated with me on the status and provided me all the information about the order. When RAM decided the air suspension would not go into production for the 2014 year, I decided to cancel the order and wait for the 2015. Terry never tried to talk me into the 2014 or give me a bad time about cancelling.

About 2 months later, I noticed a truck that looked like what I ordered on the lot as I was driving by. I checked the VIN numbers and sure enough, it was the one I ordered (without the air suspension). Apparently, it had not been totally cancelled and the dealership took delivery of it even though Terry was unaware of it. After thinking about it and seeing the truck, I decided the air suspension was not something I really needed or wanted to be a tester for, so I got with Terry and he gave me a very good deal on my trade in and the new truck. It was what we had agreed on before with no gotchas. 

What impressed me the most was the purchase process. Not only was the finance guy (Isreal) very straight forward and fast with the process. Terry took a direct interest through the whole process and didn't just hand me off to the next person. He even was doing final detailing on the truck as I took delivery to make sure it was perfect. I have never seen a auto sales person take so much interest in making sure I was happy and it was very refreshing to see.",5.0

I was able to get a good trade in offer on it!  Johnny Ray also worked his wonders for me and was able to get me a price within my budget for the perfect car I was wanting.

One of my main appreciations of Huffines is that they are not pushy. They are helpful, but do not pressure you into a sale.

In addition, I was given a great deal on the car AND a great deal on my trade-in. I've had experiences at other dealerships where I was given a great deal on the car, but not on the trade; or, a great deal on the trade, but not on the car. 

Steve Baine is very honest and upfront about any issues. Great guy! Friendly and easy to get along with. When there were any misunderstandings, he was very quick to clear it up in a very non-confrontational way. 

Oh, I also got a great interest rate on the car. All in all, I couldn't be happier.

1683,"May 12, 2014","I was contacted by Nabil through the TrueCar.com certificate program. After a bad experience at another local dealership, I went back through my emails and contacted Nabil. 

He is very genuine and wanted to help me out, with no games at all. He answered all my questions about my consideration to buy a 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee Altitude. He answered the questions like we'd been friends for years, never questioning me about my purchasing timeframe etc. He was purely out to help me with my purchasing decision, and not out to hard sell me on a vehicle. 

This in turn led my wife and I to decide to buy from him. We had all the information we needed and came in to the dealership, having negotiated price etc via email. That was very useful to us as well, being as we had a three year old in tow with us. 

We arrived at the dealership, he greeted us, and immediately took us out to the vehicle we were interested in. Took us on a test drive and basically sat back and allowed us to ask questions, allowed us to take in the vehicle and was very courteous and not trying to force a sales pitch on us. It was a perfect scenario. 

We went back to the dealer, reviewed our numbers and decided to purchase a vehicle. 

Now, the 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee Altitude edition is quite hard to come by, and even harder to track down in our chosen color of White. We found 3 the day that we were in the dealership, at other dealerships in Texas and Oklahoma. Nabil sent us on our way and called each dealership to find out if he could dealer trade. No go. They all had contracts on them. He finally found a white 4x4 in Kansas and emailed me to let me know if I wanted it, I needed to say so right then, or it would be gone. We agreed. 

The next thing astounded me, Nabil ended up driving to Kansas himself to dealer trade the Jeep and brought it back personally to the dealership. That is amazing customer service right there. We picked up the Jeep and couldn't be happier. A great vehicle, and very pleased that we were able to purchase through Nabil. 

I have no hesitation in recommending Nabil and the Huffines Jeep dealership at all!

Since the car I wanted was hung up in transport, he managed to use his more robust search engine to find a car that matched my criteria close enough to do a dealer swap and facilitated it on the same day. He was tireless, friendly, and helpful to me and my family during the whole process.",5.0

1690,"April 04, 2014","I was very impressed with Michael Fries while looking for a Jeep. We had test drove a few different Jeeps and both my husband and I just weren't quite sold on any. Well.... Mike and his great caring customer service comes running out to show me a Jeep that had just come in and I just had to see it. I instantly fell in love with the Jeep! Unfortunately, we didn't take that one due to compromising with my husband on another Jeep that we did see there but weren't quite sold on the price. So after talking for a while and the manager coming out and assisting us also we decided we were sold on a Jeep that we both loved. Michael was absolutely amazing and he has also called to follow up with me and see how I feeling with the purchase of the Jeep and if was happy. I am completely 100% in love with my new Jeep! Also Matt and Israel were both very helpful and made our experience even better. Thank you to everyone that was involved in our experience while there at Huffines.

1691,"March 21, 2014","Buying a vehicle is one of the worst experiences a person can have as it was at a previous dealer we visited. The salesman tried to sale us a vehicle, more than what we wanted or needed for better than $3,000. dollars more than we were willing to pay just to sale us a vehicle on his lot rather than search and find the vehicle we were looking for. Needless to say we walked out and won't be back. However, we had a very different and pleasant experience with sales consultant, Nabil Seyam at Huffines in Lewisville. We gave him the specific model, color, and interior trim we were looking for and he responded with, I will check our stock and if we haven't got it I will search the country and find one for you. Mr. Seyam told us he didn't have the vehicle we were looking for on his lot but he had exactly what we were looking for in transit and it would be in within a couple of weeks. Mr. Seyam is the kind of salesman we like to do business with. He was professional, courteous, respectful, and sensitive to our wants and needs and didn't try to push us to buy a vehicle we didn't want. I would rate this as being one of our best car buying experiences, thanks to Salesman Nabil Seyam and Business Manager, Israel Barrera.   ",5.0
1692,"March 16, 2014","Huffines Chrysler Jeep Dodge Ram Lewisville is my hero of all car dealerships! Let me tell you why. My brother-in-law recently got a job as a salesman at this particular dealership. In fact, the day I came in to purchase a new vehicle was his first official day on the job. We ran the numbers, decided on the vehicle I wanted, took it for a test drive, decided it was ‚ÄúThe One,‚Äù worked out the details, signed my life away, and off I drove into a beautiful Dallas sunset in my brand new Dodge Ram SLT Lonestar Edition. It had fourteen miles on it when we left the lot. My sister and I drove all over Dallas that night in our new vehicles (she was the ecstatic new owner of a Dodge Challenger 100 Year Anniversary, also purchased from the amazing Huffines). The next morning I set out on the road with my daughter and my dog to head home, about a three hour drive south. An hour into the trip, the engine on the brand new truck lurched a couple of times and the check engine light turned on. We pulled into a gas station, and when I put the car into reverse to straighten up a bit in the stall, the vehicle wouldn't move. By the time the tow truck came to pick us up, it also wouldn‚Äôt go into drive. We were towed to the nearest Chrysler dealer only to find out about two hours later that the transmission was shot. The mechanic showed me a three page long list of at least fifteen different error codes all transmission-related. I drew the short straw. Now, a dealership that‚Äôs in it just for a buck will tell you, ‚ÄúThe minute you drove that car off the lot it depreciated in value. You‚Äôll have to trade it in, take the upside-down value and assess it against your new purchase.‚Äù In fact, that is exactly what the Hillsboro dealership tried to do with me. Craig Given, a manager at Lewisville, knew that and had asked my brother-in-law to contact me immediately so I wouldn‚Äôt fall for a trap like that. To make a long story short, he said to come back, leave the truck, and that a new Dodge Ram SLT Lonestar Edition would be waiting for me, chrome rails and all. Talk about a dealership doing right by you! I would recommend Huffines in Lewisville without reserve to anyone looking. Some might say the fact that a transmission went out on a brand new vehicle does not speak well for the dealership, but there is no way they could have known it was defective and it was of no fault of their own. They did, however, step up and do the right thing by the customer, and for that I am exceedingly grateful. Thank you Huffines Lewisville!",5.0

He went out of his way to find a dealership that had a Journey R/T and get it to his  Huffines lot, at several hundred dollars less that what we had previously agreed upon.  For a 2014, transferred from Dallas Dodge, it had nearly 900 miles which almost blew up our deal, but when I asked him to throw in a 2 or 3 year oil change package as consideration for the high mileage, he called me back 5 minutes later and told me that he got me 3 years at 4 oil changes a year...great service.  He even let my 4 year old son and give year old daughter each take home one of his personal Dodge hotwheels toy cars on his book shelf.  No pressure, honest and straightforward, and no hassle.

His no-pressure, great customer service throughout the process made me decide on Huffines in Lewisville over two other dealerships I had been working with.  

The trade-in process was also seamless.  As much as it hurt me to leave behind my '05 Durango, the appraisal was a fair offer and worked great towards the purchase of my 2013. :)

Hamed was very good to work with.  
Pricing of vehicle was great.  
We love the Jeep Cherokee - great features, gas mileage, technology, and comfort.

Bad:  
Ken didn't know how to demonstrate the technology features of the car - not good that a sales guy can't make the technology work.  He was filling in for Hamed when Hamed was out for the day.
The car had the gas cap and the check engine light on when we picked it up from dealership.  We were told that when we refilled with gas both lights would go out.  They didn't, so we had to make additional trips to dealer to get it repaired.  A new car should not leave the lot with warning lights on - not good reflection on dealership.
We negotiated to have a full size spare.  As of this writing, we are still driving without a spare tire and jack.  Not a good reflection on the dealership.  ",3.6

1713,"December 17, 2013","Coulter Fleming did an outstanding job of helping us find our new car.  He listened to our preferences and offered useful feedback.  He was extremely knowledgeable about the product line (models, trim packages, options, etc.).  When it became clear that the ""right"" car for us was not on the Huffines Lewisville lot, Coulter went to work to find us just want we wanted.  Not once did he try to encourage us to alter our preferences in order to match their inventory and make his job easier.  He was there to help us - not the other way around.  Coulter provided us with regular updates on the status of his search. Two days later, he let me know that our car (the exact color and options that we wanted) had arrived at the dealership, been cleaned and inspected, filled with fuel, and was waiting for us to pick it up.  That was the 7th new vehicle I have purchased in my life and Coulter was the best, most courteous and knowledgeable salesperson with whom I have ever dealt.  I would rate that portion of our experience a resounding GREAT!

When the process moved into the realm of the sales and finance managers, our experience declined into the realm of ""OK"".  Knowledge of the product offerings declined.  The helpful, courteous atmosphere shifted and a sense of ""how can we maximize our profits on this deal"" entered the room.  Had I left the process in the hands of the sales and finance managers, I would have paid an extra 2 percent in interest for the life of my loan.  Because of my diligence and knowledge of the Jeep national financing offers, I was able to avoid the extra 2 percent in the interest rate.  I feel I ultimately got the best deal available, but it was without (maybe even in spite of) the efforts of the sales and finance managers.

The camera was installed promptly and I feel great about the purchase I have made.  ",5.0

At the time of our visit to the dealership we were not yet 100% sure it was the right vehicle for us as we had many questions.  Nabil was very professional, not pushy in anyway, and answered all of our questions about the vehicle.  When we told Nabil after our test drive that we needed some time to discuss our decision away from the dealership he was very understanding and did not try any type of pushy sales tactics to keep us from leaving the dealership...I cannot stress how important and influential this was to our final decision to return to the dealership and ultimately purchase the vehicle later that same day.  We were extremely pleased with our experience at Huffines in Lewisville and we would certainly recommend this dealership, and especially Nabil, to any of our friends and family.",4.8
1740,"July 25, 2013","I was so stunned on how I got in there and out of there. Lyon called me on a Friday and told me to come see him. At the time I had so many things including my car that I was dealing with. It was like he was my Angel sent from above no lie. I let him know that I would not be able to make it on that day but could I get back with him on tomorrow. He suggested that I do so. So Saturday came around and I was still dealing with my car he called me around 9:35 and said Timeka is this Timeka I said yes it is. He said this is Lyon I really want to work with you. I told him I'm trying to make arrangements to come see you. He said okay because I have your car waiting for you we are washing it up now. I said okay stop playing with me. Lyon said no I'm not kidding with you, just come. He didn't hound me he didn't beg me. He just asked. So I told him to give me a couple of hours and I'd come see what he was talking about. I finally drove on Huffines Lot to see him waiting for me. His response come look at your car. He attitude was so responsive and his knowledge was very helpful. I would recommend anyone who is seeking a car to see him. He let you know upfront and he will not hound you. I am very great to have him as a car consultant. And last but not least, Thanks also to Mr. Johnny Ray. You guys deserve every sell, you made this customer happen. Tell Mr.Huffines he picked a great group in Lewisville.

1746,"July 19, 2013","I was in the market for a TJ Wrangler. Huffines had an '06 on the lot that met all of my criteria. At first I was hesitant about working with a big dealership because of the general reputation these places garner, but I was soon proved wrong. 

The Wrangler in question was a standard, and I had not learned how to drive one yet. During the test drive, Lyon took the time to give me a brief tutorial. I learned enough to be able to drive away with it a few days later.

I also came into the situation with recovering credit. The financier was able to get me a very solid amount on my trade-in and worked with me on the price of the Jeep too. The interest was better than I expected, and it was recommended that I refinance a year into it to get an even better rate.

When I showed up at the dealership and I was able to get with Josh, he showed me the car and I liked it.  After driving it, Josh had my current vehicle appraised.  As with anyone, I would have liked to have had more money for my trade-in.  we tried and got a couple hundred more.

1756,"June 27, 2013","Excellent dealership purchased a 2013 Wrangler Unlimited from these folks. I felt comfortable as soon as I arrived, Josh Dulock made the whole process very seamless and didn't try to push anything on me, he listened and was transparent through the negotiations which earned my trust. Was also a pleasure working with Steve Baine, I called him one day with a question and he ensure my question was answered very promptly, which with some dealerships you cannot even talk to the manager, so hats off for outstanding leadership! Financing process was done through David Cox, which was another easy transition and even had some fun swapping stories between two vets. Honestly Huffines was not the first Jeep dealership I visited, I actually wanted to keep my business local so I visited a Jeep dealership in north Ft. Worth and it was quickly apparent we would not be able to work together, but fortunately I made a internet inquiry to Huffines and Josh was diligent in communicating w/ me and actually seemed to care about what I wanted, so needless to say when the time comes for a new Truck, sorry Ft.

All of the dealerships we had gone to were lacking the superior service. They seem to be like robots. They had no knowledge of the vehicles, and acted like they didn't care. I was really frustrated! I started googling Jeep dealerships and reading the reviews. I came across Huffines In Lewisville and the reviews were all excellent. I reached out via the website for information and David Jones called me immediately.  We drove to Lewisville, picked the one I like, test drove it, and drove it home. Through the entire process we were treated with the utmost care by David Jones and Bill Matson.

This is where Mr. Layman initiated outstanding customer service and earned my appreciation.  He kept my parameters for a vehicle in mind, and kept searching on his own.  Approximately two weeks later, Mr. Layman called me to let me know he'd found something that he thought would fit my needs.  Alas, I did not move quickly enough on the paperwork, and this vehicle was sold to someone else.  I was dissapointed, but need not have worried.  As Mr. Layman called me several days later with details about a used Toyota RAV 4 that did indeed meet my every stipulated requirement, and which I ended up purchasing.  Mr. Layman, in my opinion, went above and beyond to find something for me.  I appreciate his leg-work, his courtesy, and his sense of humour immensely.

Negotiations went smooth.  Even though my wife does not like to do it, she was able to text back and forth with me and pretty much had a deal set up before I was able to join her.  Ruben was very polite throughout the whole process.

When I arrived we were already set up with financing through our bank, so the purchase process was done in a matter of a couple hours.  In fact we only had to wait on the clean up/ detail and performance of a recent recall.

The only negative I could say is that they did push that they could get a better rate.  Each person we dealt with asked twice.  They also pushed on the service contract but that was more to be sure I couldn't claim that it was not offered.

Overall one of the best  car buying experiences I have had out of more than 10 vehicles purchased.",4.8

1797,"January 28, 2013","The team at Huffines Lewisville are ""Award Winning"" in my book at least! I started my Jeep search at another Dealer in the area. I was very particular about a 2Door Jeep Rubicon, it had to be Black/Black with a manual transmission. I had a 2011 Rubicon for a trade. The Dealer had to be willing to swap out my existing wheels/tires, front bumper and rock rails, all were custom items I wanted on my New Rubicon. It seems that most Rubicons have an automatic transmission, and the manuals are hard to find. Dealership #1 did not have any manuals, so I was prepared with choices of Rubicons I found on the internet for possible purchase. They called the other Dealership #2 to see if my first choice was available. They had assured me that the Jeep was available and they could pick it up Monday.(this was Sat.) A deposit was paid to secure the vehicle. Two days later, it turns out that Dealership #2 had installed $6,000 worth of add-ons, such as larger tires, lift kit etc... That nobody knew about! This made the deal not affordable. No one at either dealership did not even apologize to me for the botched deal, but Dealer #1 said they will continue to search for another Jeep. 
One of the other Jeeps I found in my own search was at Huffines in Lewisville. Since my deal fell through, I contacted Josh about that particular Rubicon. He was very up front with me, and told me that the Jeep had been sold Friday. So while I was dealing with those clowns, at Dealer #1, my second choice was sold. I told Josh my disappointing story, and he assured me nothing like that would happen under his watch. He expressed that he wanted my business, and would make it worth my while with a pleasant professional transaction. Josh found 4 options for me in 20 minutes. He had already secured two of them. I had to choose one, and Josh had it in Dallas the next day. Huffines price of the New Rubicon was unbeatable, and my trade in value was excellent! The parts swap with the wheels/tires, bumpers and rock rails went great with thier Service department. They even gave me a loaner car to take home and to work the next day, so they could make my new Rubicon perfect & right, just the way I wanted it. I picked it up the next day, everything went smooth. My new Jeep looks and runs great. Josh bent over backwards for me to make this deal happen. He even threw in a free window tint just because I had a bad experience with one of his competitors. If you want a good price, great trade in value, professional, courteous, friendly service with a pleasant final transaction, see Josh Dulock at Huffines of Lewisville. Don't go see those other clowns at some other Dealership, talk to Josh!",5.0

One was a 4 door Rubicon and the other a 2 door sport.  While the first purchase had some issues our second was flawless.  The Huffines staff bent over backwards to put us in our second new jeep.  For our second jeep, we initially wanted gecko, then commando green and we settled on the Deep Cherry.  Through the process the staff was patient and took the color changes in stride.  Unfortunately, Deep Cherry is no longer in production plus we wanted a manual transmission which made the search difficult.  While searching on the internet my wife and I saw a deep cherry red 2 door with a soft top at Huffines in Plano ---- I sent an email to Steve asking if that one was still available.  The next day I received an email with pictures of the jeep and it was now in Lewisville waiting for us !!  I stopped by the next day and took it for a spin; once I returned from the test drive we spent just a few minutes negotiating a price.  I ask Steve if it would be ok to wait until the next day so my wife would be present and he replied he would hold it as long as I needed.  My wife and I showed up the next day, spent just a few minutes with finance and we were done!  When we took delivery the Jeep looked as if it was just driven off the showroom floor.

I was thoroughly enjoying myself which I certainly didn't expect to do based on prior experiences.  Israel who did the financing part was also great and made that part quick and easy.

I appreciated the after-sale instructions given by Terry concerning the many features of my new vehicle. He was very patient and thorough. He also has called a couple of times to know how I'm enjoying my new purchase. The Town & Country is the first car I've purchased whereas my wife stated ""I love this thing!""

1822,"November 02, 2012","I had never visited Huffines before, but, on Auto Trader, I found a couple of convertibles I was interested in seeing.  Sales person Joe Koubek met me on the lot, and we started talking convertibles.  He answered a couple of questions I had, as one was a 2010 and the other a 2011, so there were some minor differences.  He made a copy of my drivers license, then gave me the keys to the one I was most interested in driving, and told me to drive it and check it out.  I really had not planned to purchase, as this was the first car I looked at in my car search, but I loved the car.  I got back to the dealership, and told Joe that I was interested in seeing if we could put a deal together.  They gave me a fair price on my trade-in, and they honored the internet price without any problem.  From the time I walked on the lot until I drove off in my, ""new to me"", car was about three hours.

This was one of the best car purchases I have ever experienced.  There was never even a hint of pressure.  At one point, after my test drive, I wasn't even sure if they were going to ask me if I wanted to purchase it.  Everything went incredibly smoothly, and it was great working with Joe.  

To add to the experience, after I had the car 3 - 4 days, the power seats stopped working.  I found that the fuse for the power seats was blown, so I replaced it, but it blew again when I tried the seats.  I called Joe, and he told me to bring it in, and he would put me in a loaner car.  Service ended up having to keep it for two days, but there was no problem keeping the loaner car.  Service did a great job, and everything is now working perfectly.

I was very, very impressed with Huffines, Joe Koubek and Mike in Service.  They all treated me well and made me feel like a valued customer, which is often not the case at car dealerships.

Long story short, test drive one car, went inside to &amp;amp;quot;crunch&amp;amp;quot; come numbers to have idea of payment. I stated clearly about a Lease, and he just brought one ridiculously high payment car loan, and when asked about the lease, he said that &amp;amp;quot;based on my experience the payment should be around the same&amp;amp;quot;. Really??? I replied that I went to the Dodge website where you can calculate both, and a lease option for the price of that car should be much less. He said the website is wrong. In fact asked him about looking online at the same vehicle ID# for $5k less and he went online and said the price was wrong, even thoough the car ID# was exactly the same!!! At the end, the whole experience and bad treatment or not even offering any other options even though my credit score was over 790, and no much interest from his part on options or even show in paper the lease option payment, decided to leave and not waste more time with this kind of person. Went back to Grapevine Ford wich they treat customers VERY GOOD, and trade in was excellent, car price even better for a 2013 Mustang GT 5.0 Liters, much better power and handling and payment was right, almost $150 less monthly payment than this guy offered at this Hufinnes Dodge dealer...

I just bought a brand new 2012 Jeep Liberty Brilliant Black Crystal Pearl Coat from the nicest, most helpful sales manager Xriston(pronounced Chris) Turner. Not only was he attentive from my first contact with him, he followed up and sent me pics of the vehicle I was asking to see because I hadn't had a chance to visit the dealership due to me being busy at work. He was also willing to send over a quote to me before I ever met him in person. He didn't do the usual ""well I would love to quote you but you need to come see me so we can talk more"" bit. Most of us are far too busy to spare the time to actually go from dealer to dealer to look for a new car. We do most of our research and shopping online. 

Of all the dealerships I contacted in DFW, Xris was the only one who got right back to me with the exact information I requested and the best possible price right off the bat. No beating around the bush or games. Just straight forward, honesty and great customer service. 

His attentiveness, kindness and honesty sold me the vehicle of my dreams. I absolutely love it and continue to thank Xris for making this such a painless and enjoyable process. Thanks Xris!

1882,"December 28, 2011","I visited two other Dodge dealerships in the area before stopping into Huffines.  My experience at the first two left very sour tastes as the first one had very little customer service and an unwilling intent to work on a price that would suit my need.  The second had decent service, but it was late in the evening and the atmosphere and conversations I heard while waiting for my car to be appraised was very unprofessional by the staff.  Despite this dealership offering me the most for my trade in, I was inclined to continue on elsewhere.  I visited Huffines Dodge in Lewisville's website and found a vehicle I was interested in and immediately called and was advised the truck was not in stock, but in route.  The sales rep asked if I could come in and see if there was anything else they had in stock to look at as well as get a value on the trade.  I started dealing with Josh Dulock and he toured the lot with me to no success, but he indicated that there was a truck in the back that was going to become a demo for one of the managers.  It was exactly what I was looking for.  We took a test drive and immediately wanted to begin negotiating the sale.  The price and rebates offered were great.  My only slight dissatisfaction was what I was offered for my trade, however this is where Josh turned that into a positive and turned the focus on the truck and the beneifts of getting out of a car Ive had for 6 years and back into a new vehicle.  He made it up just in his attitude and professionalism.  I've been in sales for years, and had it not been for the service, professionalism, and willingness to put me in this vehicle by Josh, I would have walked.  Josh did a great job and really sold this vehicle even to the point I ended up with a higher payment than I had wanted.  There was no going back and forth.  He was honest right out of the gate and set the appropriate expectations the whole way through to the very end.",4.8

Although the mechanic had made a mistake initially, I now have complete assurance that my car is completely repaired and I have the assurance that if I have a concern in the future the dealership will back up their work, where some individual garages may not. I am so satisfied with my experience here, that I will likely switch to this dealership, even though I had originally only stopped in by chance when my car was breaking down nearby. I feel that this dealership was more thorough with looking at my whole jeep as they pointed out problems that my Jeep dealership a few weeks prior had not recognized at all. I will definitely return to this dealership to have my Jeep serviced and perhaps when it comes time to buy a new one I  may go here as well, as the sales staff was very friendly when I stopped in to talk to the GM about my initial concerns with the service department.

1895,"October 11, 2011","I had just purchased a 2011 Toyota Tacoma a few months ago and that dealer got me 4.2% financing from Wells Fargo. 

I started to miss my Jeep that I traded in for the truck and saw the new 2012 Jeep models and was impressed with the new engine and transmission and decided to trade in the truck for one. Huffines offered less than black book value for my trade. They raised it a little bit more a few weeks later but McKinney Dodge had offered another $1000 more than they did and even signed on it. 

I go to Huffines yesterday after receiving an email from the salesman asking if I had purchased a Jeep elsewhere or not and I told him no I had not. He said they may be able to work a better deal than last time and to come over and look over the models and I found one that I was interested in and gave the $$ amount I could do for a monthly payment. Salesman said he would work on it and call me back. 

He later calls me and gave me a range of prices depending on an option we discussed the day before. I asked if he had done the credit check and they had not. I asked him to call me back if we were still good on those prices and he agreed to call after the check was done. 

A few hours later he calls back and says we are there but could not discuss specifics. So I drive 15 miles out there only to find out the lowest range they had was almost a hundred dollars more a month over what we had discussed and this was due to the interest rate being more than double what I had been previously approved for on the truck. 

So to break it down they no longer offer fair trade in values compared to other nearby dealers. They do not listen to what customers say they can afford and have you go through the wait and trip to the dealer when in fact they cannot get the pricing discussed. 

That is 2 trips out there that wasted my time and gas and has made me very angry and kind of hurt because I have done quite a bit of business with them since 1996 and so have my family and friends. They used to be pretty stand up people. It does not appear to be that way anymore and I will not recommend them.",1.8

1905,"August 30, 2011",Once in a blue moon do you find a sales person in the car world willing to be the best he can for his customers and his family. This sales person exemplified not only professionalism but character and integrity. He went the extra mile to do his very best no matter the circumstances. That is truly rare in this world today and selfless which in my book is a true strength in a sales professional.

1906,"August 08, 2011","Xris made it easy to do business without phone calls or coming to the dealership.  He respected our privacy and busy schedules and stuck to emailing us directly, without the normal auto generated responses you receive from so many dealerships.  Once we settled on a vehicle and price, he retrieved the vehicle from a sister dealership without charging a fee, and had the paperwork completely ready when we showed up at the dealership.  My wife and I negotiate contracts for a living and I can honestly say this was the quickest auto loan closing we had ever experienced.  After the sale, Xris and the parts manager Louis, kept us posted regarding the upgrades/modifications to our vehicle.  Their work was outstanding, but the tint company they used was not as detailed as I would have expected.  They did however re-tint the front two windows and gave us a loaner to drive while doing the work.  Overall, I would recommend Huffines Jeep of Lewisville and Xris to anyone looking for a new Jeep.  We are used to luxury vehicle dealerships, and while service and amenities at Huffines are not at those levels, the attention and great attitude of everyone we dealt with made up for it.  ",4.8

Other dealerships we shopped at always had us wanting to sit and sign docs and push us to close the sale. Never did this happen with Xris. Second of all we got a fair value for our trade in which for us was great. Once we had the car we wanted selected Xris came back with such a great price that we accepted and bought the car right then and there. No haggeling and fussing involved.

Sean did such a wonderful job taking care of their needs, that they referred him to us.  We have used him ever since & I have absolutely NO complaints.  He responds to all of our inquiries very promptly.  If we have to leave the car, he makes arrangements for a rental per our warranty & always keeps us posted as to the situation of the service.  He stays on top of the service to ensure we are not without our car for any longer than necessary.  He keeps up with our maintenance schedules & always makes us aware of any promotional coupons for various service.  There was only one time that I had to wait longer than normal on the service of the car.  However Sean was NOT responsible for this situation as he was not in the shop that day.  As far as pricing, Sean always tries to get us the best prices available.  Are the prices high - I think so, but then -- they are probably comparable to other ""dealership"" prices.

Xris was helpful and courteous displaying none of the tactics previously encountered across town. I had done my homework and Xris acknowledged this and earned my business within 15 minutes. Xris agreed to email some requested information to me which he did promptly (By the time I got home the information was in my email folder). In the end Xris and I negotiated a fair price to me and his organization which I am pleased with. Following the purchase of my new Dodge, I sought Mr. Turner's assistance once again as I could not locate running boards for my new truck online. Xris again exceeded my expectations. Instead of telling me he would get back with me, or direct me to the Manufacturer website, Xris went the extra mile by identifying the running boards, checking availability and subsequently ordering my parts.

1926,"June 13, 2011","I would like to start out by saying that I am not blaming Xris for my experience this time around at Huffines.  He was extremely helpful &amp; I wish I could've taken him with me elsewhere!  However, this was not my first experience at this dealership.  My husband bought a vehicle at Huffines last year and everything was great until it came to the paperwork.  Making copies of the paperwork was an issue for them.  Anyways, the reason I went back was because the salesman was a great guy.  He wasn't there this time, but Xris was quick to step in and help.  Again, everything was great until it came to the financing.  As soon as Steve recognized me, I felt like everything went south.  I honestly felt like they just stopped trying to help me.  Everything Xris did to help, they put a stop to and the numbers kept getting worse &amp; worse.  It was as if instead of trying to do whatever they could to get me in a car, they were doing everything they could to get me out of there.  Odd that the next dealership I went to, I walked out of 3 hours later with a great car, they took my trade-in and kept my payments under what I was willing to pay.  Where at Huffines, that was impossible unless I came up with $11,500.  How ridiculous!  Needless to say, I will not only never go back to Huffines, I will make sure to let everyone I know my negative experience there.",1.8
1927,"June 11, 2011","My overall experience with every aspect of Huffines in Lewisville was excellent.  I had been car searching and researching for some time when I decided to check out Jeep dealerships in my area.  Xristan called me to follow up on my internet inquiry.  He was courteous and accommodating when we scheduled to meet at the dealership.  He then offered to help me with directions or come and pick me up from a few blocks away when I got lost.  AS I searched for a jeep within my price range, he was patient and accommodating.  When I changed my mind, he was easy-going. Xristan steered me toward a car that was a great fit and a super deal, as he knew that was most important to me. I experienced no pressure, plenty of space when I needed it to consider my options, and an overall exceptional shopping experience.  In addition, his sales manager, Jessie, worked with the numbers to offer me just what I needed.  Even though it took an additional three or four hours to deal with me outside financing, Xristan was patient and long-suffering!  He never made me feel rushed or like an inconvenience even though I knew I was when my insurance and financing took more time than expected.  He stayed with me until I had all the necessary faxes sent and until he had walked me through all of the specs on my new jeep.  He even let me follow him until he motioned me to the right road to take me home!  I will recommend this dealership, and Xristan in particular, to everyone I know!",5.0

1930,"June 07, 2011","I have been in the car business half my life. I am female, so I tend to buy cars from people that I know in the business. I was apprehensive at first to even consider leasing another Jeep. This is because I no longer know anyone who works at a Jeep dealership! Then, Xriston Turner emailed me. I admit to giving him a hard time at first, via email, by telling him exactly what I wanted and didn't want. I figured he would head for the hills. He didn't:)
He was persistent but not pushy. He was patient and courteous and I respected him for that. ( I had dropped in about a month ago just to get a price from the fleet manager and let's just say I have NOTHING nice to say about him.) That's why I was so hesitant to give the dealership a chance. The only reason I took a chance is because Xriston really wanted my business and he treated me as an equal-rather than some pain in the butt stupid female. His manager, Eric, came out and met me and I liked him ALOT as well. My 12 year old stepson was equally impressed. Both of the guys treated Issac as if he was ""part of the car deal"". I was touched by that and Issac seemed to be so proud! I got some serious brownie points with Issac!
By the time we left the dealership, I felt like I had known them forever! I even told Eric he should hire me:) I will tell you, that by far...this experience was the best I have ever had:) And I have bought alot of cars! Xriston and Eric are the BEST.

1932,"May 24, 2011","My first contact with Xris was via internet. After that we had gone back and forth a bit by text messaging. I was previously in another dealership & wanting to shop around so I decided to give the Lewisville Dealership a try. I can say that my overall experience with the salesperson, Xris, is quite shameful. 
Upon our first personal contact my sexuality was brought into question... I do not wish to elaborate here about this.
I had explained to him that I had just left one of their competitors a bit frustrated. I explained that they were not able to locate what I was looking for and would not really talk numbers without my husband present. He told me that he used to work there and that they liked to drink alcohol during business hours. He said that would explain some of their behavior. 
I let him know what I was interested in & we looked at a few on the lot. They did not have exactly what I wanted. We went inside & he did some checking the computer & found 1 at another location (explaining to me that I did not want to go to Randall Noe in Terrell because they were no good) that if it was available they could do a trade with them. He could not get a hold of anyone there because they closed an hour before the Lewisville location. I told him that the other dealership had told me that one was not available. He explained to me that they do not trade with the because of ""bad business"" and that they probably did not even call them... 
I left that evening & Xris said that he would call & check on the availability of the vehicle at the Terrell location.
The next morning & I had received phone call & texts that the one in Terrell was sold. We went back & forth & he was trying to locate something for me. I had explained to him that I was not is a hurry & if I needed to wait until the 2012 came out that would not be a problem. I was not able to answer my phone or texts for about an hour & he just blew up my phone. Said stuff like, ‚ÄúI feel like I am failing you, etc, etc. Are you still interested? I haven‚Äôt heard from you in a while. I don‚Äôt wanna keep bothering you if you‚Äôre not.‚Äù It was kind of freaky, if you ask me. We went back & forth quite a while without finding anything and I felt like there was a lot of my time wasted. He knew what I wanted. I had already said if it is not out there I would wait. I can understand wanting to make the sale but come on I was away from phone for an hour. That went on from about 8:45 ‚Äì 12:45 am.
After my husband & I went out later in the day I started getting texts from him again. I really thought we were done. A few minutes after 5pm he tells me via text that he thinks that he may have good news. He & his Internet Director thinks that they may have a way to go & asks if he can call me. I am not where I can take a call and tell him that. We went back & worth via text answering question I thought he already knew the answers to until 6:50 pm. Nothing really came from any of this. I never really found out what the ‚Äúgood news‚Äù was.
I had a break from this on Sunday. Thank Jesus. Then Monday came around. We went back & forth from 11:40am ‚Äì 5:45pm via text msg while I was at work. I had asked him to check on another option before & he never mentioned it until I brought it up again. He threw out some numbers on the cost of switching out navigation systems that didn‚Äôt match up & I felt he was trying to take advantage. I even questioned him about it & he said that he would need to check his numbers & never mentioned it again. Next thing I know he asked when I could come back to the dealership‚Ä¶ I was floored. My response to him was, ‚ÄúWhat for? You seem to be wasting my time.‚Äù Then he jumped on the defense and went off on me. Something about him giving me 200% & him trying to feed his family & him feeling like I slapped him in the face, I‚Äôm done & he went on for quite a bit. His text was so long it broke it down into 4 different texts. Just crazy! 
This is why I have rated Huffines Chrysler Jeep Dodge Ram Lewisville so poorly. I can‚Äôt believe how immature the salesperson, Xriston Turner, acted. I can spend my money on a new automobile with someone that actually will listen to my needs & wants to do business with me.

He recognized that we could not afford a 2011 Grand Caravan so he steered us to a new 2010 Grand Caravan they still had on the lot.  It had most of the features we needed but not all the fluff that the Kia had.  As we talked numbers the Sales Manager Eric Hansen came in and made us a very reasonable offer.  Since we had not yet seen the Kia we set out the buy, I held off until we could look at the Kia.  Of course they tried to keep us from going to Kia but I insisted on looking at the other vehicle.  

      We had a horrible experience at Kia.  The Kia sales people were overbearing condescending and tried to make is feel obligated to buying their car.  We walked out on them and went straight back to Huffines Dodge and purchased the Grand Caravan.  Honestly the Kia may have been more bang for the buck but I truly am a fan of customer service and Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Hansen were great.  They recognized that my main concern was Kia had a better warranty and a DVD player, so they provided me with an extended warranty that matched the Kia warranty and agreed to put a dvd player in the Dodge.  We are completely happy with our purchase all the way to the finance guy (sorry, I don't have his name).  One other point I would like to pass along.  At one point, Mr. Hansen realized that my wife and I were split on our decision.  He talked with me and actually told me to make sure that my wife was happy with the purchase even if it meant loosing the sale for him.  That was huge for me.  I have purchased over 10 cars in my adult life and this was by far the best car buying experience I have had.   ",5.0
1952,"February 20, 2011","   I have given this review because I have had horrible experiences buying cars and trucks. You know the old &quot;what will it take to get you in this car today&quot; thing. Well from the minute I met Brent all he did was try and help me get what I wanted. We talked about price not payments, the right truck not the one they wanted to get rid of. He said they were like family and now I actually believe that. Jeremy is Brents boss. The guy you need to go to to make a deal. I thought I wanted a Dakota. He didn't have one and couldn't make a trade with a local dealer so he actually cut a check to a dealer to get me the truck. The whole time loaning me a brand new 1500. When the Dakota arrived I was so in love with the 1500 SLT crew cab I was driving. I told him I wanted that instead. Jeremy ent to work and by the time I arrived at the dealership he had cut $2,000.00 off sticker and gave me $4,000.00 in rebates bringing the price in range for my wallet. I even ended up liking the finance guy, and I always hate the finance guy.
    Bottom line. Mr Huffines has been in Business in Lewisville since the dealership was in old town. There's a reason for that. You keep a business running by treating people fairly. They went above and beyond for me. I love my truck...just got done washing it. I would recommend this dealership to everyone.
    I don't write these kind of letters. in fact it's my first. Brent, Jeremy, Thank you very much for making the difference for me.",4.8
1953,"February 20, 2011","The staff is friendly and eager to sell you a car.

They are upbeat and and want to work WITH you, not against you as some dealers seem act.

Truck in which I interested was cleaned and ready for a test drive when I arrived from out-of-town.

Salesman was actually knowledgeable about the car and its accessories ... in recent year this has not been the norm.

After agreeing on price, the Finance Manager, was as good as I have dealt with. He was precise and didn't push on the ""extras.""

He did show some extended warrenty options which are being considered.  No pressure at all.

Would go back to this dealership, even though they are 5 hours away.

1954,"February 14, 2011","My experience with Huffines Lewisville was perfect. Their response time is off the charts and the level of friendliness is more inviting than I've ever received at any dealership.  Jeff conversed with me constantly, even on his off days.  I am more than satisfied with the service level that I received and refer everyone to them every chance I get. 

Thank you so much for your help!  May God bless you.",5.0
1955,"January 28, 2011","I look so forward to getting my car serviced here at Huffines.  They are always very courteous and do a fantastic job.  I never have to worry because I have always found that all the work is done to perfection.  I am a woman and I need a service center that makes sure that everything is done that needs to be done.  As a woman, I can drive my vehicle but I don't understand what needs to be done other than getting the oil changed.  They always check everything.  They keep great records so they know when I need to have certain things done.  Also, I don't have to worry about price gouging.  I feel that they do what has to be done, when I bring it in and they never over charge me.  If something turns up that will be expensive, they come to talk to me about it very professionally and explain to me why it needs to be done.  Then they get the job done as quickly as possible in a reasonable amount of time.

I have been driving since I was 16 years old and now I am 71 years old.  I have never (please understand that I said NEVER)had such great service in all of these years.  I tell everyone about their service especially women.  And now that 121 is opened, it doesn't take me any where near as long as it used to to get to their facility.  No matter where they were, they are the company for me, that knows their clients and their business.  They know how to take care of the cars that come to them and I feel great when I leave.

Another thing, is that their rest rooms are clean as also their waiting room.  They have some kiddie things in the waiting room to keep children occupied while you are waiting.  Several times I had to take my grand child and he just loves to go there.

Huffines in Lewisville is a top notch organization.  It seems to me that they know how to pick the people that work for them.  It is a fantastic company, with fantastic people working for them and the greatest service I have ever found.  Ann Cardile ",5.0
1956,"January 26, 2011","I have had 5 previous Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo leases through various dealers in the Metroplex.  I find the suit my personal needs perfectly.  My 36/45000 lease was up on my 2008 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo, and I was shopping for a new lease.  

The dealer that was assigned to take the lease return took the information on what I was looking for and then never called back.  

I then went to big name local leasing firm.  They had a deal put together within a couple hours for a 38% higher lease payment.  They then tried to tell me that the problem was the bad residual on Chrysler products, particularly the Jeep GC.   Some how this didn‚Äôt see right so I called in to Ed Wallace‚Äôs Inside Automotive program but didn‚Äôt get on because he ran out of time.  

I dropped Ed an email and the next day I had an answer in which he said it wasn‚Äôt so much residual as it was the lack of factory incentives.  Ed recommended that I contact Mike Biggers at Huffines CJD Lewisville.  

I‚Äôm a very straight forward ‚Äúno hassle‚Äù lease person.  I know what I want and I know what the lease payment needs to be to make it work.  I decided to take Ed‚Äôs recommendation even though I must admit to being a little skeptical about his potential to be biased by Huffines advertizing revenue. 

I used Ed‚Äôs email link at Inside Automotive to email Mike Biggers a list of features.  I was surprised when Mike, himself, called me back.  Mike looked at the numbers on the lease return and my features request and called me back within a couple hours and indicated that he would be able to deal with the list of feature and the lease payment number.  I was still almost a month from the end of the lease so we agreed that rather than talking about a sting of vehicles moving though his inventory, I would call him back toward the end of the month.  

I emailed Mike a couple weeks later and he had Eric Hansen call me back and work on the package.  I was a little concerned about being handed off but I found Eric to be very straight forward and business like and by the next morning we were back to discussing which of several colors would I like.  (Color, other than Black, is a superfluous issue to me.) One more email and it was done.  I never met them, ran my vehicle in to them for an appraisal, played silly ‚Äúsign if you‚Äôd take this deal and let me talk to my manager‚Äù games with them.  I sent them a credit application by email and when I walked into the dealership, they presented the car while they printed the paper work.  No last minute, can we upsell you to this or that.  Just an efficient business transaction.

If you‚Äôre tired of playing games with dealers and leasing agents, I strongly suggest you speak to Mike Biggers and find out what and efficient business transaction is.

Mike‚Äôs done what the other 5 metroplex dealer‚Äôs haven‚Äôt been able to do, and that‚Äôs make this necessary evil an efficient business transaction‚Ä¶for that he will find he‚Äôs gotten my return business.

1957,"January 25, 2011","Huffines staff truly has their customers best intentions at heart. Their staff is professional, knowledgable, and honest. Buying a vehicle or getting body work done can be stressful, but when dealing with Huffines staff, I felt at ease.  Their staff was patient, kind, and honest. They answered all of my questions and have impeccable follow up. I will be sending all my friends to Huffines. ",5.0
1958,"January 24, 2011","During March 2010, I went online to Huffines website and asked all sorts of questions to Kevin, via their web chat. I talked to Kevin for over a month on before I walked in on a Thursday night, with no appointment and no knowledge of Kevin even being at work. My husband, who hated car dealerships until now, and I met Kevin and we walked away with a 2010 Dodge Ram for my husband.

In September 2010, I purchased a Dodge Journey for myself and when I test drove the car, it pulled to the right. The service department fixed the problem and we drove home happy. After leaving the dealership, we sat in traffic for over an hour on our way home and weren‚Äôt really able to enjoy our new car until the next day. The next day, we got back into our Journey and it started pulling to the right again. We went back into the dealership everyday for two weeks trying to get this problem fixed. They even purchased me a new Journey from another dealership and that didn't fix the problem.

I talked with Mike Biggers, General Manager, via phone for 30 minutes and after that phone call, everything was PERFECT! He asked me to come back in and test drive my car again and if I still didn't feel comfortable in my car, they would take care of it. Between Kevin Jackson, Mike Biggers, Greg Birdsall, Sales Director and Steve Baine, Finance Director, I walked away with a 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo! They really bent over backwards to make sure that I was happy! I absolutely love my new Jeep and would buy another car from Kevin any day of the week!",5.0
1959,"January 21, 2011","I would like to leave some positive feedback for this dealership because I can't believe the negative feedback that has been left in previous reviews.  First off, I was in no way what so ever in the market for a new automobile.  I was simply getting an oil change for my existing Dodge Ram Truck.  

After dropping off my truck I decided to walk over to the new car lot because I wanted to see the new Challenger.  As I was looking at the Challengers, Jason, came out and greeted me.  I told him that I was just killing time while I was getting an oil change.  I said I had no intent of buying a new car or truck and he said no problem and he wasn't pushy at all.  He asked me if I wanted to test drive the Challenger and I said sure, so we test drove the car.  The only down side of my entire visit was the test drive.  I don't know if it is a Huffines or Dodge thing but you can't get a true feel of a vehicle in a three mile test drive.  A little more time on the road is definitely needed, but I didn't have any intention of buying so maybe he sensed this.  After getting back I remember saying that it is hard to believe that somebody would spend 41,000 on a car when they could get a truck.  I was driving a 2005 RumbleBee and I wanted to see the new trucks until they called me to let me know that my oil change was done.  While looking at the trucks, Eric Hansen, came out to introduce himself and to let me know that he would do anything to help me get into a new truck.  I told him that I was not in the market for a new truck and he wanted me to test drive a truck anyway, so I did.  The 2011 Dodge Ram Sport Crew Cab definitely drove better than my RumbleBee and it had all the bells and whistles, I was definitely impressed.   

After test driving the 2011 we went inside as I continued to wait for the oil change.   Another sales consultant, David Jones, came to assist Jason because he was new at his position.  David never made me feel out of place and we all got along like we have been friends for some time.   I remember Eric asking me if I wanted him to run numbers on a new 2011 Dodge Ram.  I said he could but I really wasn't looking to buy because I didn't want a larger monthly payment.  Eric asked me what was a target number to get me interested and I told him.  He came back with a number and I said that it was a little high.  He came back with a different number and included some extras that I thought were very generous.  Eric was never aggressive with me to the point of me having to buy a new truck.  I thought he was he very professional and friendly during the whole process.

When we were going over all the logistics of what could be a new truck for me, I was very particular of what I wanted in a new truck because if I was buying, I wanted it to be what I WANTED.  The crew at Huffines were doing everything they could to cater my needs in finding me a new truck.  After finding the right truck for me and getting my trade in numbers and extras added on I was finding myself on the verge of buying a new truck.  One small problem, not really a problem but I wanted my wife to finalize the deal.  I believe she was wanting a larger vehicle than Bee but didn't want to increase the monthly payment to a non friendly number.  After she saw what the truck had to offer with the add ons, the new payment, and how friendly Eric and David were, it was a no brainer.

I thought the guys worked well together during the whole process.  I never once felt like I was pressured into buying a new truck.  We talked about sports, sports teams, favorite foods, and cities we have visited, just like a group of buddies.  I would highly recommend this dealer to anybody who is in the market for a new car/truck.  They will make you feel at home and treat you right in every way!!!!

1960,"November 25, 2008","I called Richardo and he was very arrogant and quick to want to get off the phone.  I'm convinced if a person has less then stellar credit, your dealership just blows us off.  Richardo every time I asked a question he took it as a negative thing and eventually passed me onto the Assistant Sales Manager.  The Assistant called me and promised to get back with me that day because my wife and I had a 10:00 Saturday morning appointment with your dealership.  When I talked with him I asked him to look into things for me and to provide numbers, so we do not waste our time or his time the next day, Saturday.  He told me that he would talk with the Finance manager and get back to me before closing on that day.  He never called back and I had to email Richardo well after our appointment time on Saturday and then the Ass. Sales Manager called me.  He told me that your dealership pulled only one credit bureau and that he was too busy for us and that is why he never called back.  I asked him to please send me his card and he refused.  He told me that he would get my email address from Richardo and then email me his information.  To this day I have received no emails from him.  When we decide what we are going to do, (either by out our lease or purchase a new Jeep) we will go elsewhere for that decision.  I will also tell all the people that I come across or even know and tell them that other then service do not go to Huffines in Lewisville.  Service was an excellent experience and I will not hold the less then professional atmosphere and down right rudeness of the Sales department against the Service Department.  I was very put out by your dealerships lack of professionalism and down right lack of caring for your possible customer.  I will let the Gov't know that I think that the Big 3 automakers do not deserve a buyout at all.  Maybe if they declare bankruptsy service will come back when all the dealerships are begging for our business.
Just to let you know I had been in sales for over 25 years.  I was always taught that if a possible client kept asking questions that was a sign of them wanting to be sold, not a negative sign like RIchardo took my questions as being.
Hopefully I was detailed enough? Have a great day!
Hopefully business is plentiful because treating potential clients like you treated my wife and I demonstrates that your dealership is quite picky on just what customer you want and what customers you do not want.  Follow through and being aggressive you would have found my credit score quite a bit higher then the only bureau that you pulled.
Thanks but no Thanks

1961,"July 28, 2007",I went to buy a ram 2500 cummins.  The salesman actually used the F word with me.  He continually used cuss words.  This was after I had told him I had just returned from Church camp!  The kicker was I had a quoted deal on a pickup at another dealership.  Huffines had the exact same truck only theirs was a demonstrator with 6000 miles.  When asked what they could do on the truck with 6000 miles they gave me a piece of paper that had over $38000 written on it.  About $4000 more than the truck I was going to buy that was brand new and had only 100 miles on it.  Don't buy at huffines because they are difficult and have rude sales people.,1.0
1962,"August 27, 2004","Was there to buy a 300c.  The deal was done except it was late in the evening and financing wouldn't be able to be done until morning so shook on the deal and went home.   Arrived at 9:30 A.M. the next morning to find out that they used me as leverage to sell it to someone else in the 10 minutes that I left and the dealership closed for the evening.  I never received a call and they just let me show up to tell me that they sold it after I left and would  I be interested in another vehicle.  Huffines has no integrity or moral value of their customers and I would recommend any other dealership other than the ones they run as this was stike two.  Strike one happened a few years previous at their Plano location where they ""lost"" my deposit check within 12 hours after I wrote it for a deposit.  Never got it back and they could have cared less.  Actually told that I didn't write one even though I had a carbon copy and I had to pay to cancel the check.
