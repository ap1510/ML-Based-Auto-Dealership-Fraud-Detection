They were also very patient with all of my questions, and gave me detailed answers.  Very easy to work with!  They were  also very transparent on their costs of the vehicle and all warranties!",5.0
1,"June 04, 2020","Whether you are looking for a new or used vehicle, do not put Toyota of Plano on your list. They will continue to text and email you, trying to sell you another car long after you have already purchased elsewhere. Multiple phone calls, return emails and text will do nothing. Avoid at all costs.",1.0

3,"May 26, 2020","My wife and I took our oldest son to test-drive a used vehicle that we found online; due to COVID-19, we had to set an appointment, but salesperson Rodger Gaines was very accommodating.  When we arrive, we quickly met with Rodger, told him which vehicle we needed, and he did not not try to upsell or exert pressure at all.  He LISTENED, and he not only brought us the car we wanted to see, but also a comparable Toyota version for the same amount.

We test-drove both, and my son really liked the one we came to see, but there were a couple of cosmetic issues with it; Rodger resolved to get these issues taken care of immediately with service. We then met with Derek Haines in finance, and again, it was pressure-free.  Derek got to know us, and in talking understood that the only reason that we were even co-signing with my son (and going through the loan process) was to help him get a credit score established, since he just graduated from high school.  Derek took the time to explain how important establishing credit is for a young consumer, and even showed my son examples of how his monthly payment would be affected if I had not co-signed with him.  He then made sure that my son understood the consequences of not paying on time, and that to get a credit score established, he will need to make at least 12 payments on the loan.  More importantly, he didn't waste our time by trying to get us to take a loan with a higher APR than what my bank had already quoted; he actually came in with an APR that was LOWER.

It was such a wonderful experience, and I was so impressed with everything about this dealership.  Once we left Derek's office, Rodger made sure to express his gratitude, and offer his assistance if there were any issues.",5.0

6,"May 08, 2020","I came into the dealership on a Thursday after doing a good amount of homework on what i was looking for.  I was greeted by Edwin and within 15 mins he knew exactly what i wanted and was able to show me all the options they had for me on the lot.  Not only did i get to see all my available  options but he always kept in mind my ""must have"" lists! I was also greeted by the assistant manager Sama during my visit who was an absolute joy to speak with.  I ended up buying a 2020 4Runner TRD off road (which had all my must haves). I can not thank you both so much for a great experience. Highly recommend this dealership!! Thank you Toyota of Plano",5.0

10,"March 06, 2020","Service today was horrible from the time I arrived to the time I left. I arrived at my appointment time at 11a. My assigned Service Advisor was Leandro Gonzalez who should be fired immediately. He has poor customer service and is a liar. He did not greet me, examine my car, go over my profile to see what services are needed. I waited 15mins after arriving and had to go to another advisor to let them know I have not been helped. I sat at the dealership for over 2hrs and car was not ready so I told Leandro that I needed to leave as I had already been there too long. He goes to the back and drives my car to the front. My car was missing a hub caron the front driver tire and he lies and say I brought my car there without it which is a lie, please watch security cameras that will show my hub caps on driver side was on there when I arrived. The manager Bob comes and put a new hub cap on. I will not be returning and will be letting everyone know the type of service I received and to be aware. I dont know if I even got my oil changed and car inspected nor do I feel say as the way I brought my car for a simple multi point inspection was not done. I came December 2019 got an oil change and Leandro stated I needed another oil change without reviewing my profile or even going over the checklist with me to advise if my car needed anything. LEANDRO DID NOT DO HIS JOB AND SHOULD BE TERMINATED AS HE IS BAD REFLECTION FOR TOYOTA OF PLANO ",1.0
11,"March 03, 2020",This is my 3rd Toyota and I am so disappointed in the service department. I bought the new rav 4 back in September 2019 and it make a weird noise. I have taken it in twice and they could not find anything. I don’t believe they are really taking the time to look. I plan to sell the car soon. They service act like they do not care. Believe customers do not come first. Buy somewhere else. I never buy from them again!,1.0

20,"January 30, 2020","This is truly the most unprofessional Toyota I have ever encountered. It astounds me that this is now supposed to be the headquarters of Toyota, because the people that work there have no respect for customers shopping for a brand new car or those who already have the misfortune of owning one of their cars. A few weeks ago I got a flat tire very close to the Toyota dealership about an hour before they closed. When I called to see if I could bring the car in (even if they didn't look at the tire until the next day) but just so I didn't have to drive 15 miles away on the donut just to take it there the next day, the receptionist was so incredibly rude. It's one thing to say that isn't common practice, but it is another to be so dismissive and disrespectful to a paying customer. The next day I called again to see if I could bring the car in. (As a side note, the tires were bought from Toyota so they are under warranty) when I spoke to a different person the next day he said ""Warranty isn't a thing..."" I ended up taking the car to Toyota of Richardson, which is 40 minutes away from me just because I hated the idea of paying these disrespectful people to fix my car. I'm truly disappointed in Toyota, as we have had so many Toyota cars, but each time I interact with someone at this location I am reminded why it is an unfortunate excuse for a business. 

A few weeks prior to this, my family and I were searching for a new car for my uncle. We made the poor decision to try Toyota of Plano. While the saleswoman was running around like a headless chicken, we were waiting in the parking lot for a total of 3 hours. In this time, there were at least 2 instances where she disappeared for more than 30 minutes at a time. Car dealerships are supposed to convince you to buy their cars, not send you running in the opposite direction.
 
This location is so nice, new, and so close to my house but unfortunately a business cannot be run by a shiny building. It has to have people functioning inside that have some ability to interact with, and sell to customers. I truly would never do someone the disservice of recommending this location to them, and I highly recommend avoiding this joke of an establishment by any means necessary.",1.0

23,"January 28, 2020","I was recently in a car accident that totaled my 2008 Toyota Corolla and needed to replace it. I shopped Toyota of Plano online for another Corolla, but couldn’t find one in my price range among its used car inventory. I did, however, locate a 2017 Yaris iA at a price within my budget. I researched the subcompact car and read multiple positive reviews that compared it favorably to the Corolla, in terms of reliability and durability, so I called and made an appointment with salesperson Richard Lindsay to test drive the vehicle.  

Richard was extremely cordial, knowledgeable and, upon seeing me with my broken elbow from the accident in a brace, very sympathetic. During the test drive, I told him about the accident and that I believe the Corolla saved my life – that had I been in a smaller car, I wouldn’t have survived. I also told him that I was concerned the Yaris was that smaller car. Enter General Sales Manager Jeremy Dodson. After Richard shared with him my story and my concern, a very compassionate Jeremy made me an offer I couldn’t refuse – for a little more money than I wanted to spend, I’d get a 2016 “Certified” Toyota Corolla and, more importantly, peace of mind!

Neither Richard nor Jeremy pressured me into making my purchase – something that has happened to me in previous car-buying experiences. I appreciate how both men made me feel comfortable and confident in my decision, and I would certainly recommend both to anyone. ",5.0
24,"January 25, 2020","I recently bought a used vehicle here and had an overall bad experience.  My salesperson was nice and let me have time to make decisions so this review isn’t so much about them as it is for the process, customer service of management, and wait time.  I spoke to a salesperson over the phone before coming in to ease the process and they knew which vehicle I wanted to see.  When I got there, I had to wait awhile until I was seen and the salesperson started talking financial goals, what I wanted for my trade in, and how much I was currently paying instead of taking me straight out to the vehicle I was interested in seeing.  It's probably took 25 minutes before I actually got to see the vehicle I came for.  Once I did decide to buy the vehicle a few days later, I had to wait again for 30 min in the lobby just to sign the monthly payment and offer agreement before being transferred back to a secondary holding area where I waited for another almost hour before I was seen for financing.  I watched multiple employees walking back and forth talking and laughing and not really working until I finally got up and asked someone if had been forgotten or what the next part of the process was.  Finally I was seen an hour later.  At this point it was dark and I had only seen the vehicle in the dark on the lot when I left on Saturday evening.  On Sunday morning I went to drive the truck and saw two large scratches and small dents that were not visible at night.  I immediately called the dealership on Monday morning and told them about what I found and asked if I could bring the vehicle back to have their touch up guys fix the scratches.  The manager said they already spent $150 on paint touch up prior to selling vehicle and denied the request.  I sent pictures of both day and night pics showing how the scratches are not real visible at night but very visible during the day and he still denied the request.  I would have expected a little customer service here to spend a few hundred dollars to remedy the situation since I spent close to $40K on a vehicle with them and they are listing my trade in for MUCH higher than what they gave me for mine.  Seems to me they have some profit margin there to touch up paint on a vehicle they sold to me as basic customer service and to keep me as a future customer.   Judging by the 300+ Yelp reviews with an average rating of 2.5 Stars, I guess that's just par for the cours",2.0
25,"January 25, 2020","Mr. Simon Gendelman was much more than just a sales rep. From the very first minute, he was asking only the RIGHT questions, without pushing on the customer. He accommodated all my needs and worked very hard to meet my desired car AND within my budget. Of course there were couple of hiccups out of his control, but within 24 hours he found a better alternative car for me.
I am quite satisfied with his efforts, and am also happy to have come to know him in PERSON.   ",4.8

27,"January 24, 2020","Kelly was a great sales rep to work with here.  She was non pushy, understood that car buying is big financial and life decision based on family dynamics and needs.  Kelly allowed me to take my time inspecting the vehicle, test driving the vehicle and giving adequate time for me to discuss with my spouse prior to purchasing.  She was calm and always greeted with a smile.

46,"December 03, 2019","On Wednesday, November 20, 2019, my husband and I came in to see about how much we'd have to pay each month for a brand new Camry or CH-R. We were told that we'd be meeting with a certain salesman and one of the ladies at the front desk pointed him out to us and asked us to have a seat while we waited for him. As we were waiting, he began to walk towards us and took one look at us and walked the opposite direction. As if he considered us not worthy of his time or like we looked like we didn't have any money? Honestly, that was the RUDEST thing we've ever seen and it was beyond offensive! We really should've just left the place right after that but we figured we'd be GLAD to deal with anyone else other than someone like him. But boy, did it get worse after that!!! 

Shortly after, Zee Umar came to greet us and we told him which vehicles we wanted to look at. He was nice in the beginning but after the test drive and after we told him we were obviously not willing to pay a crazy amount each month for a car that we felt was not worth it, he became REALLY rude, EXTREMELY PUSHY and refused to take no for an answer! He used phrases like ""You just need to sign the paper"" when we were in the middle of trying to figure out why they were trying to get over on us with the monthly payment! He was CLEARLY angry and frustrated with the fact that we weren't pushovers and wanted to thoroughly understand what was being sold to us and at what price. His whole face turned red in anger as soon as things started to not go his way. He actually walked away from us to go and take a cigarette break!!!! He came back after a few minutes of just disappearing on us and reeked of cigarette smoke! What kind of salesman goes to take a cigarette break in the middle of a sale??? I guess we really stressed him out by taking our time with looking at the fine print! 

And now for the worst part of all. We had already given him our car keys in the beginning to have them value our trade-in. They offered us a decent amount for our car (the ONLY positive thing about this experience). However, the issue is that they basically held my husband and I hostage and WOULD NOT give us our car key back so we could leave the place!!! It was excuse after excuse as to why, after at least an hour, we STILL  were being forced to be there when we clearly expressed our readiness to leave. And just to clarify, they held our car key for over an hour AFTER they had already checked out our car for an appraisal! So they just didn't want us to leave. We just couldn't understand why they were forcing us to be there! Finally, it got to the point where I just said forget it, I have an extra key with me and we'll just come back and get it from them later. We had to pick up our kids from school in time so we just couldn't wait any longer or continue playing their games. Zee kept on being entirely TOO persistent and finally gave us our key back when he realized we didn't care anymore that they had it. We got out to our car to get in and he comes rushing out to the parking lot trying to tell us to just take the Camry with us and keep it overnight. We told him we didn't want the car and that we were leaving. He brought us our car key and it actually had a blue tag on it with all of our vehicle's information on it. And that's when we realized why they didn't want to give us our key back. THEY PROCESSED OUR CAR AS A TRADE-IN WHEN WE NEVER AGREED TO DO THAT!!!! He had already ""sold"" us the Camry even though we never even agreed to buy it! We hadn't signed any paperwork stating we'd buy or anything like that! 

As we were driving off the lot, Zee called us REPEATEDLY!!!! He called my husband's phone AT LEAST four or five times and called my phone at least three or four times all within a matter of a few minutes immediately after we were driving off the lot! We told him NUMEROUS times that we just were not interested in what they were wanting us to pay just to drive a Toyota Camry! I ended up having to block his numbers from my phone!

A few days later, I get an email from Toyota congratulating me on my purchase of a new Toyota Camry, advising me to register my new vehicle through some program called ""Toyota Owners"". He clearly processed a sale that wasn't even a sale and now Toyota thinks I'm driving their car! I was going to write this review the same day that I got the initial email from them but life happens and I didn't end up doing it. This morning, I get another email asking me to do the same thing. So that's what prompted me to go ahead and write this review. I'm not sure whats going on over there but my husband and I both agreed that this was THE ABSOLUTE WORST experience we could ever have hoped to NOT have with a dealership!!! I will NEVER return to this place ever again! And now I'll be calling over there just to make sure that we aren't going to be charged for a car that we don't even own! All this over a Camry that wasn't even my first choice. Though I liked the car, I told Zee that I was way more interested in a C-HR but he didn't even bother showing me what I truly wanted. He just wanted to sell me what HE wanted to sell me. Not what I actually wanted! Just an all around HORRIBLE salesman!

Oh yeah, the finance guy named Max also made our experience a bit more horrible but I'm really not going to get into that right now. It's just way too much to type and I've already written a book here. This has taken up enough of my time. Basically, he just didn't listen to our preferences or needs AT ALL! ",1.0
47,"December 03, 2019","I've bought 4 vehicles over the last 10 years from Toyota of Plano.  The last vehicle, a 2019 Tundra was purchased this summer from Edgar Posada & Mirza Begovic.  It was a positive experience.  So much so when it came time for my adult daughter (27) to lease a car, I sent her to Edgar and Mirza, told her they would take great care of her and knew she would walk away with a great deal.  You can imagine as a father sending his daughter into a car dealership that your confidence would have to be extremely high because after all, it new car sales, right?

After taking a half-day off of work, she reached out to me and told me that she could reach a deal because her payment was going up by well over $100 a month for a 2019 and the down payment that would be required was more than she had planned.  Disappointed - my impression was maybe my daughter was biting off more than she could chew with her list of ""must haves"".

A couple of weeks went by - then I received a call from her yesterday and she had independently reached out to an internet sales guy (no prior relationship) at Toyota of Grapevine who told her he would get her in the car she wanted.  Skeptical of the deal he presented I sent an email to Edgar and Mirza asking how this could be since I had trusted them to take care of her.  What I received back from Edgar was a nasty email telling me it wasn't possible.  Then, guess what?  10 minutes later (this time he didn't cc in his boss Mirza) he admitted that he was filtering the wrong source on Toyota of Grapevines website.  Needless to say, I was surprised by his email because he didn't have his facts straight and second, he insulted me as a customer.

Three hours later, I received a call from my daughter who was driving home in, not a 2019 but 2020 Rav4 where her payment barely went up and her down payment was half.  So much for Toyota of Planos ""Friends and family"".  If this is how you treat family - no thanks.

I'm embarrassed that I sent my daughter to two guys that didn't take care of her and two guys that I trusted.  Not sure what I was thinking - this is why car salesmen have the reputation they they have.

My advice to you - don't go see these guys.  Go to Toyota of Grapevine where you can walk in off the STREET and get a better deal than you can from someone you've done business with. - oh and not receive a nasty email from them to add insult to injury.

It was poorly plastidipped, there were hail dents on the hood and the rear bumper was crashed in. They were asking almost clean retail for this garbage. I wasn't deterred too much, I'm adept with car repairs and I could have fixed it up. Everything went smoothly up until their trade in offer. The sales staff were polite but I couldn't help but feel like they were trying to take advantage of me when they offered me $500 less for my charger than the listed price of the RAM. I was offered $11k for a car that averages a $15,500 trade in in clean condition.

I had done a great deal of research, knew my numbers and what was a fair price.  While working with these gentlemen, there was no haggling or game playing - it was a fair discussion with simple math.  

But what truly impressed me was the what happened after the deal was done.  I bought a Tundra and didn’t like the wheels.  So there was a follow up on the wheels.  Having worked with Toyota of Grapevine once in the past it was amazing that their memory was so short after the deal was done.  This WASNT the case with Toyota of Plano.  Mirza and Edward made me a priority after the sale was done.  Which is why I’m writing this review.

He wasn’t pushy about anything at all when I decided to buy my RAV4 from him, and I felt I could truly trust him when it came to closing the deal. That’s definitely not something I’m used to feeling when it comes to dealing with auto places in general, but Ali was able to put me at ease with his relaxed demeanor. Since then, I had to take my spare key back to get it fixed since I discovered it wasn’t working shortly after I got home. Ali assured me he’d make sure it got fixed and he’d hold it for me so I could pick it up when I went to get my plates. He then went out of his way and hand-delivered my spare key after there was a mix up when I originally went to pick it up the day before. I don’t know many people who would do that, but considering the dealership is about 20 or so minutes away from where I live, I sincerely appreciated it as it saved me from having to go back up there again.

I called and spoke to Forkan, who verified they had the vehicles in stock.  We communicated via text & I let him know when we would be available to come in & look at the vehicles.  The communication was just right, he never bombarded me with calls or text messages, which I appreciated.  For reference, I was in contact with two other dealers & both had numerous sales people call me over & over again, which was very annoying.
When we got to the dealer, Forkan was expecting us & had the vehicles ready for us to test drive.  We were there with our two small children, so he was mindful of our time.  We wanted some time to think about our options & he was not pushy or aggressive to have us make a deal that day, but I did let him know the price we were looking to pay.
We slept on it & texted him the next morning to arrange the deal.  My husband went back to the dealer & was back in less than 3 hours.  There was no haggling & Forkan worked with us to get us a fair price.
When we came to pick up the vehicle, it was ready to go & we completed the titling paperwork with Mike.  Everyone was easy to work with & the full experience left us very pleased.

242,"April 23, 2019",Was only half way interested in purchasing a new vehicle as my 2017 Prius V only had 12'000 miles. Received a letter advising the dealership was giving top dollar on a trade-in and decide to check it out. Had vowed never to purchase another vehicle from this dealership because of lies that were told to me by a manager when I purchased my 2017 Prius. When I was told he no longer worked there decided to listen to what they had to offer. Ali sold me my 2017 and he was very professional in how he handled my displeasure on the lies that were told about my trade-in. Saw the 2019 Prius and told Ali to work up a pricing based on   their best price and I would say yes or no. A fair price was offered on my trade-in as I understand the dealership needs to make a profit and they worked hard to get the selling price down on the new car. Long story short drove out of the showroom that afternoon in just two hours in my new vehicle. Look forward to my next purchase from Ali unless they have made him a manager by then,4.8

294,"April 02, 2019","When the haunting task of looking for a Senior young lady a vehicle approached, I was really not looking forward to all the hassle of bidding back and forth that you typically go through at all the dealerships around North Texas.  My daughter and I decided to have a Saturday ""daddy-daughter"" day where we would start off with a nice breakfast, or lunch if she decided to sleep in, and then hit the streets to test drive a full array of pre-planned vehicles from a printout of the ""best leasing values of 2019"" from the internet.  As we went from dealership to dealership (total of 6 in all), test driving and hearing the salesmen pitch at each lot, it was finally down to two she really liked, but ONE she really loved.  Both vehicles were in the right price range with the ONE she really loved being a few dollars per month more, we stopped by Toyota of Plano.  Our salesman, Parth Gadhia, a new Texan who just relocated from a dealership in the Pacific Northwest, was the best thing since sliced bread.  He was so understanding of the whole process and there was absolutely no haggling back and forth at all.  It took longer to just sign the documents than it did o choose a truck, test drive, and have my daughters heart pumping 90 to nothing with thought of her first Tacoma she just finished driving.  During the test drive, Parth explained all the features of the truck and was super personable.  He could relate very well with us and was very well versed in the Toyota family of products.  In the end, after everything was said and done, my daughter was the happiest woman on the planet and being that I have leased and purchased several different vehicles in my lifetime, this experience was the best of them all.

316,"March 26, 2019","We have purchased quite a few cars and owned virtually every brand. Customers in a Toyota dealership are educated consumers and at Toyota of Plano are treated as such. We came here based on the reputation and reviews and learned they are accurate. We had plans to comparison shop for compact SUVs (including BMW, Cadillac and Volvo) and left here—our first stop—-with the newly upgraded RAV4 and couldn’t be happier. I counted 4 other RAVs driving up for delivery besides ours and we were out of there early Saturday afternoon on a stormy day  Robert Mele keenly identified us as prepared shoppers and presented us with a couple of options based on our wishes. Great product knowledge. Didn’t push one trim level over another just layed out the differences. We found the right fit in the right color with everything we wanted. Amazing what Toyota includes as standard equipment. We then sat down and cut right to the chase. No games   No ping pong back and forth no mid Manager sticking nose in the door. Best offer best price and very! fair trade. Smooth experience in the Financial office also. Car quickly detailed and ready to drive away. No question left unanswered. Will be sending a couple referrals this way including the kids. I’m just curious how many darn vehicles they sold that day!  I’ve never seen so many people buying or taking delivery in such a short period of time. ",5.0

After all, what could it hurt? Jay had the vehicle of interest prepped and ready for my arrival, and all my interaction with him was very professional and candid.
Jay introduced me to Jose Compos my sales representative and almost immediately Jose was able to transform a task that I approach with dread into one that was exceptionally delightful.  He knew the product, was patient with questions, accommodating to skepticisms that I had and all the while delivering with infectious enthusiasm.  With a combination of Joie de vivre and exceptional competence Jose almost made me shout “Here, take my money!” 
By working with Jay and Jose I spent the least amount of time I have ever spent at a car dealership to complete a purchase and time to me is a tremendous value. I would highly recommend this dealership, especially Jay Bradshaw and Jose Compos.

What a pleasure it was to work with Faz Imam and Edgar Posada.  Compared to other times when I bought a new car and all the high pressure that goes along with it, this time it was absolute joy.  We started with Faz, who was extremely helpful, professional and knowledgeable.  As we got closer to zeroing in on THE car, Edgar took over.  Edgar has the patience of a saint and is one of the nicest and most professional salesmen I've ever come across.  He patiently showed me several cars; he was honest and truthful in sharing some pro's and con's of accessories and, in the end, he made this car buying experience the best ever.  During the ""paperwork"" part of the buying process we hit a snafu with one of the credit reporting agencies - no fault of dealership.  Oh my goodness, Edgar patiently sat with us and waited while we tried to work it out thru phone calls to Experian!!!  I wonder how many sales opportunities he missed out on while helping us?  We'll never know, but he never once acted impatient or frustrated.

He sold me the car that I was looking for, was not pushy, answered all my questions and worked with me on the negotiations.
I think that the dealership should do a better job when cleaning their cars to be picked up and be more realistic on the market price as their competitors offer better deals. The only advantage was that they had the car available.

My 2010 Toyota has skipping and repetitive bumpy (instead of smooth) ride when I gently push on the the break at a speed 50-60.  I took it to Toyota of Plano more than 6 times for this issue over the last 7 years. They fixed the brake pads, the disc and some other parts. It improved partially and returned after few weeks always.

It had been very frustrating experience and futile effort on my side. I am very disappointed and displeased with that service and with Toyota. I just want to know the problem and fix it and establish safety for me and my family.

484,"December 18, 2018","Was great until I ran into a problem on my 2014 Camry that should've been covered by my platinum warranty. The rear window defroster shattered my back window from the inside, and you can clearly see the burn mark from the heating element in the rear window  that shattered it while defrosting, and taking my daughter to school. They would not take care of me, and put me in a rental if they kept the car 7- 10 days. No guarantees that I would be covered. Obviously my daughters school is not gonna close while they resolve this and investigate. IM OUT  411.00$ THANKS TO TOYOTA and there fraudulent coverage. Do yourselves a favor don't buy the extended warranty because it's worthless. They'll find a reason to say technically its not covered sir, or make it so inconvenient for you that you cover the cost yourself.    ",1.0

The carfax report and the work done on the car was already in a folder ready to show me, Cho showed me the engine and what he could about anything that was fixed or replaced to back up the report in the folder.  

When I brought my trade-in, Cho was with another client and I was literally met at the door by Ayman who didn't miss a beat and knew who I was and why I was there the moment I walked in the door and assisted with giving me my new keys and taking my old car. 

The finance manager Brian found me better rates than what my bank offered and he made signing the papers a painless, simple and well organized process.

Overall, there was no sales pressure, there was absolutely minimal stress in deciding and I loved the fact I was able to test drive on the highway to see how the car felt at a high speed. 

Cho, Ayman and Brian were amazing, I honestly can't imagine how they could've been more friendly and helpful!

I gave in and bought the premium warranty. Well, forward 6 months as I made an appointment a few days ago and got up early this morning to be there by 7am.

I arrived at the dealership not expecting to drive away with a car, but honestly prepared to dread the experience. However, Chris helped us from start to finish; so sweet and easy to talk to. He made the entire experience painless and really worked with me since I was so anxious about everything. He also really worked hard with us on the price to get us the best deal. I was very impressed with how much time he took to assist me throughout the entire process even after we finished with all the paperwork. He walked me through all of the fancy gadgets, which was a huge step up from my previous car. I drove away with a Rav 4 XLE that is absolutely beautiful and I couldn’t be happier!

(which of course is always the ""worst"" part) but Jose made it SO fun and SO easy! Oh, and Jose speaks like 10,000 languages, so speaking Russian with him was fun!

635,"September 08, 2018","Can't say enough about the experience of working with and purchasing a new Tundra from Roberto, John F., and Kash at Toyota of Plano.  Most dealerships I've worked with are in a hurry to get you into a car that they want to sell you instead of paying attention to what you're actually looking for. 
 Roberto asked the right questions to get a good idea of what I had in mind and questions I had on pros/cons of purchasing new vs. slightly used (which I had primarily done in the past). It was clear he listened - in addition to the vehicles I had already singled out online, he offered suggestions that were exactly in line with what I was looking for or fell in to play with the feedback I was providing.

In the end I selected the primary vehicle I saw online that brought me to the dealership to begin with.  Roberto and the rest of the staff made things sweet and easy when negotiating.  They listened to what I was looking for from a financing standpoint, understood the budget I was working within, and provided multiple avenues to get us all where we wanted to be.

Highly recommend visiting them if in the market for a new vehicle and make sure to ask for Roberto!  He went above and beyond - staying late to get make sure I was taken care of.  Like I said - the ideal car buying experience.",5.0

I felt like he and Tony were really on my team; I didn't feel like I was heckling over prices or being sold something that I couldn't afford or didn't really want.

645,"September 04, 2018","I tried hard to like this dealer - all we wanted is a new car without having to go back for service in the first week - 2800 for upgraded rims and tires only to have them vibrate and all 4 needed to be replaced becasue they were bad.... add on TRD Pro grill not reassembled correctly, missing fastener as well as widshield washer fluid wont dispense. I was under the impression that when you spend 45K on a new car the only time you need to return to the dealer is to buy accessories and get maintenance.... this truck has been returned 3 times within 520 miles. The sales folks are so very nice - service is not detail oriented, the first time the truck was returned to me they merely rotated the tires - I returned within 15 minutes. All the daler add ons were really overpriced - buyer beware when it comes to the details on any daler add ons. Make sure that everything was reassembled properly or just select a different dealer.

Follow up was prompt and professional with a little humor included, which was much appreciated. I made an early morning appointment and really did not believe a deal would be possible; however, Jose Campos felt otherwise and was very patient with my own hesitation but personal need to trade due to disability and he never wavered through negotiations and multiple text messages to/from my wife. In the end, the right vehicle and right deal were decided upon with relative ease thanks to Jose and the team at Toyota of Plano. Smooth is how I would describe every process from sales to finance to vehicle delivery and I had much needed help with technology as well. And another first-a friendly hug with sales - Jose!

713,"July 27, 2018","My Dad is no longer able to drive.  Roberto Guido helped us return his lease car - with unfailing courtesy, patience, professionalism and respect.
______
On Wednesday, July 25th my 93 year old father returned his Toyota Highlander lease car to Toyota of Plano. He’d made the decision to ‘hang up his spurs’ and leave the driving to others.

My Dad has owned Toyotas since 1980.  That first Corolla was passed on to my brother, it transported him from Texas to graduate school in Ohio and was his family car until 2001.  In recent years my Dad leased a series of Toyotas – driving each for the contract period and then turning it in for a new one.

This year, incapacitated by fall, he my mother moved from their home in College Station, Texas to an assisted living apartment in Plano.  His decision to relinquish his Highlander had two unaccustomed elements. For the first time he was returning his car before the lease expired. Secondly, he was dealing with a new and different Toyota Dealership.

When we and I arrived at Toyota of Plano, we were greeted by a young salesperson, Roberto Guido. Immediately, Roberto took us under his wing and guided us through the process. What truly impressed me was the manner in which Mr. Guido dealt with my Dad.  He was unfailingly courteous and patient - professional and respectful.

To understand the depth of my appreciation for this treatment, please allow the following digression:

Until this summer, my Dad lived over thirty years in College Station - the home of Texas A&M University.  After his service as a decorated infantryman during World War II (Bronze Star and two Purple Hearts), he attended A&M, graduated and earned a commission in the United States Air Force.  (Many of these stories are told in two books – just enter an Amazon search for “Duke Hobbs.”)

Following the Korean Was he went into business for a number of years – retiring from a brokerage firm that he co-founded and led as Vice President.  He was asked to return to A&M where he taught in the College of Business for over twenty years.

In College Station, my Dad is truly a revered fixture – known and respected by local government officials, University Administrators, faculty and students.  He has been a leader in University commissions, former faculty club president and is a recipient of the University’s Distinquished Alumnus Award.  I mention all of this, by way of contrasting his experience since moving up here.

As his son, I have observed and been appalled by how little interest, appreciation or regard is shown to older citizens.  I have watched as my Dad is ignored or treated with insolent impatience. Sadly, younger people seem particularly guilty of this. They seem oblivious to the sacrifices made my men and women of my Dad’s generation – who literally saved our (and THEIR) way of life as free Americans.

I relate all of the above, as a contrast to my Dad’s treatment at Toyota of Plano – and particularly by Mr. Roberto Guido. First of all, this young man offered his help with no apparent benefit to him.  I assume that his income is largely based on commissions - and I’m certain his time and patience with my Dad meant opportunity costs to him.  Secondly, his words, actions and demeanor were the absolute epitome of professionalism and courtesy.  Were I to recommend a secondary business enterprise for Toyota – I would suggest putting Mr. Guido in charge of a new profit-center - selling Customer Service training to other businesses in non-competing industries.

Finally, I must admit that my wife and I have been reliable Honda customers for several decades.  Following this experience, we have resolved that our next new car purchase will begin with Toyota of Plano.

Best regards,
D Hobbs",5.0

715,"July 26, 2018","I have now been to Toyota of Plano two times and neither visit has been pleasant. I'll explain...

First visit - I called to make an appointment to have the oil changed and tires rotated on my truck. The day they had available I had an appointment at school that I couldn't miss. I ask the woman who is helping me make the appointment how long and oil change and tire rotation takes. She says an hour, an hour and a half at most. I err on the safe side and make my appointment 2 hours before my school appointment. I arrive 15 minutes early and I stand in the service bay next to my truck for 12 minutes before anyone even acknowledges me. 12 minutes is a long time when you're just standing there awkwardly. Finally someone comes to help and gets my paperwork together. They take me into the service advisers office and before doing anything I confirm with him that I will be out in less than 2 hours. His response? ""I can't promise that"" I explain my school appointment and that the woman I made the oil change appointment with said an hour and a half max. He shrugged and suggested I take their shuttle. Fine. He asks where I am going and it's 8 miles away. He immediately responds that the max for the shuttle is 7 miles. Really?? You aren't completing the work on my truck in the time promised and you are going to argue with me over A mile?! And to that point - an oil change and tire rotation takes 45 minutes max so 2 hours is more than generous. Finally he agrees to shuttle me to my school appointment and tells me just to call or text him when I am done to have the shuttle bring me back to the dealership. So as I'm wrapping up I call and text him to which I get no response. So I call the dealership and just tell them to send the shuttle. OVER AN HOUR LATER the shuttle arrives. I get back to the dealership and the adviser is nowhere to be found, I end up getting helped by someone else. And not to nitpick but they ran my truck through the wash and it came out looking worse than when I brought it in.

Second visit - I receive a Service Bulletin that my ECU needs to be reflashed. So once again I make an appointment. At least this time I was greeted in a timely manner when I arrive. The guy gets my name and off he goes. He's gone for probably 5 minutes (meanwhile its over 100 degrees outside and I'm just standing there). Finally he returns and says that they can't get me in today and I should leave my truck until tomorrow. I have an appointment! And its 4 hours prior to when the service department closes! He offers no explanation and leads me to the service advisers office (Chris Kim) who said he needs 5 hours to complete this SB. Ha! It's a reflash, it takes just a couple minutes on Techstream. Once I call him on his BS he tells me that he is backed up and won't be able to do it today. What aggravates me the most is that they couldn't be bothered to call or email me letting me know that they needed to reschedule. This dealership isn't close to me so round trip I was on the road for over an hour and wasted my gas. Do I get an apology? A free car wash? Any kind of empathy? Not even close. Chris just tells me I'll need to come back and goes back to his computer. Un-freaking-believable the lack of customer service this dealership has. What's funny is that I planned on looking at one of the used cars they had on the lot while I was waiting on the reflash. But I can confidently say that I would NEVER buy a car from these clowns.

Moral of the story - STAY AWAY FROM THIS DEALERSHIP!

I went directly to their website and I was impressed with the wide selection of competitively priced vehicles, specifically for me the condition and selection of lower mileage used Toyota's . I decided to inquired about a vehicle I was interested in. Robert Frauens contacted me via text as requested. I explained to Robert the criteria of a vehicle I was looking for and He was helpful in checking availability of my request and sending pictures and details. My interest was sparked and I decided to drive the 3 hrs. to look at the cars. I'm glad I did. I was able to find a Limited Rav4 with low miles, and left over warranty for less that what I was finding elsewhere in Oklahoma. I was trading in a vehicle and I was offered a fair amount on my trade without any hassle. Robert was great especially being he was scheduled to leave early for vacation.

761,"July 10, 2018","I purchased a car here and one of the finance managers (John Fulgoni) added gap insurance and an extended warranty without asking me. He told me that my monthly was a little higher because of the finance rate that I qualified for, and that I got a warranty for free because I worked at Toyota Corporate. All turned out to be a lie he used to leach commission from me.

Some time later I checked my loan amount and it was about $2,000 higher than I remember the value of the car. I went back and they told me it was because I signed up for the warranty, etc. Needless to say, I was extremely upset. They even produced a document where I had signed off on the lower rate and then the document where I signed off on the higher rate. They're great at confusing their customers to increase their bottom line.

I spoke to the manager Tony Pan and he refunded the gap insurance after many months of back and forth, but refused to do anything about the extended warranty because I had used it (car was leaking pretty much right after I drove it off the lot, I was also encouraged to use my ""free warranty"" by the sleazebag finance manager that added it for me). Extended warranty itself cost me $1,700. 

The team dragged their feet over 2 months trying to ""help"" me but in the end, I'm stuck with what I, admittedly, signed off on. But beware of John Fulgoni, he is a lying xxxxxxx through and through, and denied everything. The managers refused to help me.

He turned out to be a complete gentleman with exceptional car knowledge and he brought me Kit Kat bars during my 4.5 hour journey there at the dealership. So, he was okay with me. Also worked with Patrick, John, Tony and Jeremy. Great guys.

I had a couple of hiccups, which I won't detail here. But, suffice it to say I was treated with respect and dignity and when all was said and done, the whole sales team bent over backwards to make me happy. And, they did.

835,"May 31, 2018","Toyota of Plano imposes some unnecessary and burdensome requirements on USAA members for a simple cash purchase of a used vehicle.   For example, take a 40-year USAA veteran member with excellent credit making a paid-in-full purchase with a personal check drawn the member's USAA Federal Savings Bank account to purchase a used vehicle with no financing.

As required, I provided Proof of Insurance when I test drove the vehicle.  When I went to purchase the vehicle, I was REQUIRED to sign the ""Agreement to Furnish Insurance Policy"" which is used for a credit sale or lease, even though this was a cash purchase.  The Owners/Managers REQUIRED the sales staff to pull a credit report on me, even though no financing was involved.  Further, I was then REQUIRED to call USAA on the spot, at 8:00PM, to add this particular vehicle to my current USAA auto insurance policy.  I had to provide a proof of Insurance for this particular vehicle before I could complete the transaction.

Both these requirements were time-consuming and unnecessary, particularly considering this was a cash/non-financed purchase with funds drawn on a reputable banking institution (USAA).

I have purchased several used vehicles by the same means (USAA personal check, paid in full, no financing) at other dealerships and I have never been subjected to such onerous scrutiny.  Craig Vlasak and Brian Salm were very helpful and understanding, but I understand their hands were tied by company procedure and they could not waive these requirements.

First, the Owners/Managers need to realize that that USAA allows a grace period of several days after the purchase and will fully insure a purchased vehicle during that grace period.  This is precisely so one can purchase a vehicle and have it automatically covered by USAA insurance as soon as you drive it off the lot.

Second, the Owners/Managers might consider giving the finance people, ie. Brian Salm,  some discretion to waive these time-consuming requirements, particularly in the case of a verified long-term USAA member who banks and insures with USAA.  A credit check?  Really?

In closing, despite my disappointment and frustration with Toyota of Plano's company procedures, I went ahead and completed the purchase of the vehicle.  The vehicle was really in great shape, it checked out good with my local mechanic, and Craig and Brian were as helpful as they could be.

850,"May 24, 2018","I went to Toyota of Plano as it was the closest dealership to me that uses the USAA car-buying service. 
I emailed with a salesmen named Roberto, who gave me a quote for a Black RAV4 XLE.
They quoted me a price, and I set up an appointment to look at the car, and possibly even buy that day.
When I arrived, I was excited, because the salesmen said he does not push things on people that they don't need, like leather seats, add-ons, higher trims, etc.
However, when we went to look at the RAV 4's they had in stock, he ""couldn't find"" the black XLE we had discussed prior.
He showed me a bunch of other colors with different trims, and tried to convince me to like other colors, like blue or white, and then started trying to convince me that I should get the blue RAV 4 limited with leather seats and ""upgrades"" which include a cargo net/privacy screen at an extra charge... (funny, because he said when we first got there he would not do this)..
Then finally we found a black RAV4 XLE, and he led me to believe that was the one he quoted me for, so we test drove it.
I was super excited and ready to buy it.
Once we sat back down in his office, he went to financing to get total price, when he came back it was THEN that he told me this was not the vehicle we discussed, and it was about $5k more, which in his words, ""is really only like $60 a month - you can do it"".
I asked him why he did not have the car we had discussed prior, and he said that he had tried calling me multiple times today to let me know the car was ""about to be sold"" and I needed to come in immediately, etc. I told him I had not received one phone call, email, anything from him today.
I told him we will go home and discuss it, and also go to other dealerships to see if they have the car I want at the price I was quoted by USAA car-buying service.
After this, he warned me ""to be careful, because what a lot of salesmen do is tell you the price and say they have the vehicle in stock, then when you get there they change it up on you and don't have the vehicle or the price is more"" - I laughed at this, and told him ""oh, like you just did to me"" to which his reply was ""oh, but this time that really happened...""
Already having a bad taste in my mouth about this guy, I got up to leave, then he grabbed the price quote for the higher priced XLE from my hand, and said I could not take that.
I asked him why not, and he said that it is Toyota of Plano's property - and is not to be taken home, or shown to other dealerships. I then went to take a picture of it then if I ""couldn't take it"", in which he grabbed it from the table and said I could not do that either.
It was the most shady experience I have ever had at a car dealership, and I will NEVER go back here again and will always warn friends/co-workers to not go here as well.

I eventually went to Atkinson Toyota South Dallas and the 45 minute drive was well worth it as the salesmen gave me the price he quoted me via email as it should be. They even threw in free accessories at NO CHARGE. I refer everyone there now.

929,"April 05, 2018","Toyota of Plano (“TOP”) passed all of my tests and made buying a used vehicle a pleasure.  I will trade there again.

There are two key factors I use in sizing up a dealer:  Inventory and “Attitude”.  If you really want to determine what kind of dealership you are visiting, go to the used car department.  On the new car side, all dealers have the same inventory.  It may vary in color, etc. but they are all new cars with full warranties.  It’s a level playing field.

By going to the “pre-owned” side, you can easily determine the company’s philosophy and what makes you want to buy a car from them.  There are “A” dealers (ones that only stock crème puffs and auction off the trade-in inventory that does not meet their standards for reliability) and this philosophy usually translates to better service after they have your money, “B” dealers (ones that buy the cars that “A” does not want attached to their name and auction off), and “C” dealers that buy the cars that “B” gets rid of.  “TOP” is an “A” dealership, one that wants to develop repeat customers, not just a one time sale.

Ever go to a dealership where when you left you wanted to take a shower?  I’m talking about the ones where there are a half dozen scuzzy sales people standing outside like vultures waiting to pounce on you as soon as you exit your car.  Then they want you to fill out paperwork including your name, address, and other personal information including all but your “hat size”.  All of this is done before you even discuss what you are looking for???  You know that you are going to be bombarded with calls after you leave. 

I don’t appreciate this kind of aggressive sales tactics.  They try to force you to waste 45 minutes of your time before you even know if they have a car that fits your needs.  I know these guys are just trying to make a living, but I’m there to buy a car, not make them a living.  At “TOP” I did not encounter any of these approaches, a major plus in my book.  “Cho”, my sales person, greeted us when we went inside, asked us what we were looking for, and promptly helped us find the vehicle.  NONE of the typical 45 minutes’ worth of dealership time wasting, offensive, insincere nonsense.

We found a vehicle that worked for us.  Jeremy Dodson, the Used Car Director, made it easy for us to make a deal.  He did not turn this into an all-day affair that I have seen at many dealerships in an effort t to “wear you down” so you succumb to their price.  Brian Salm, Finance Manager, made the transaction a breeze.

During the entire process, we were treated with dignity and respect.  I will buy from them again, and that is the highest compliment that I can give.

Within a few minutes of submitting the request through Costco's Auto Program website, I was contacted within a few minutes and set an appointment at a time convenient to me. I advised that I would also be trading in a vehicle.

I was slightly early for the appointment, however Jose was very accommodating and immediately welcomed us and we began to discuss what I was looking for. Jose introduced Hunter, who is in training, to join us. Jose and Hunter did a great job of explaining the vehicle's features and the pros/cons of the different packages I was interested in. While we were discussing and looking at the trucks, my vehicle was being appraised for the trade-in value. After test driving two different Tundra models, I made my decision, we reviewed the trade-in value (which was an amount I was expecting) and we completed the paperwork with Mark Miller. We have previously dealt with Mark at another vehicle closing in the past.

We were once again treated very well by everyone we dealt with and when we took delivery of the vehicle, everything was explained and the vehicle was in perfect condition.

If you're in the market for a Toyota, Jose and Hunter will take great care of you and Mark will explain all of the financing and warranty options available to you in plain language that people not familiar with automotive service will understand.

Another great new car buying experience!",5.0
1011,"January 25, 2018","What a great time I had with the purchase of my 2018 Highlander XLE from this dealership.  My current SUV only had two rows, and was on a lease from another dealership.  As a busy grandparent helping out my daughters, I really needed to consider a vehicle  with three rows as well as easier install of car seats!  In December 2017, I started my 'research/test drives' focusing on three different vehicles and dealerships that met my criteria within the Dallas area.  Of this process, working with Sama Hawileh at Toyota of Plano proved to be the most professional and best in customer service.   I started with an on-line request for a test drive and was 'assigned' to Sama.  From the very beginning, she LISTENED to what I needed in my next vehicle as well as my budget.  Though there were great end of the year deals, I was not ready to finalize my decision.  However, she helped me review the Highlander XLE features, pricing (vs other Highlander models) and provided a test drive. There was no hard sell or repeated phone calls/emails after this visit.    

So when I saw the January 2018 promotion for 0% financing for the Highlander, I immediately scheduled an appointment with Sama.  She facilitated this car purchase seamlessly with a minimum of standing around ""waiting"" for a purchase price to final paperwork with the Finance Manager.  Throughout this process and hands-on instructions regarding my Highlander features, she was well informed and extremely helpful. 

I have purchased and/or leased numerous vehicles over the past 40 years, and I can't say enough about my sales consultant, Sama Hawileh.  Further, my sincere thanks and appreciation to this dealership's entire Toyota team that made my new car purchase informative and hassle free.      ",5.0

Sama was amazing. I felt completely at ease at all times and never felt pressured. She walked me through my options and provided clear guidance throughout.

1050,"December 31, 2017","We were very impressed with the level of service at Toyota Plano. We worked with Max and Human in sales and Carlos in finance.

I reached out via email and was contacted by Max in less than 15 mins. I was looking at one specific truck but wanted to look at several options, this was not a problem and he scheduled a test drive for the next day.

We needed to modify our plans twice and they had no issue and accommodated us easily. We asked to drive several trucks of various trim levels and sizes. This was incredibly easy. Human (salesman) had us sit in the truck with the heater on while he filled out the necessary paperwork and made copies of my drivers license.

I've purchased several new cars and I can say that these guys are legit. My best buying experience to date. As soon as we let the sales staff know we had an appointment, we were shown to the lounge and even though we were there an hour early (in their busiest time of the year) we were taken care of in less than 5 mins.

After we decided on a kickass Tacoma we went back and forth with the finance desk a few times until we landed on a deal that we feel was very fair.

Once we closed the deal, Carlos in finance walked us through all the details. There was one detail that didn't match what we talked to the salesman about. It was immediately corrected, and in our favor. 

After all the papers were signed Max went over all the details of the service agreement, and all the details of the truck which are pretty in depth. He made it clear that he was available if we had any questions or needed anything. I'd HIGHLY recommend Toyota Plano. ",5.0

While in transit to the dealership from Tarrant County, the Toyota of Plano salesperson called to tell me the dealership sold the very vehicle I selected while the dealership knew I was in transit.  Irate, I asked to speak with the sales manager.  I received the pathetic excuse that “it’s first come, first served, and we received no deposit.”  Of course, the Toyota of Plano salesperson never asked me for a deposit, nor did the salesperson instruct me that one was necessary in order to hold the vehicle.

Instead, I went to Honda and received excellent service, and I ordered two new Hondas — one for myself and a second for my daughter who is turning 16.

The buying experience at the dealership was great - Wade was both very friendly and very knowledgeable. He had the car I had expressed interest in ready and waiting for me, and through the course of a long test drive, gave my wife and I a wealth of information about the late-model Corolla.

I also want to put in a good word for Brian Salm, in finance, who handled the payment part of the purchase. Even paying cash (as we were), there's still a lot of necessary paperwork to go through, and Brian made it as painless as it could possibly be.

I want a professional to take car of my vehicle and instill confidence in their integrity and thoroughness. I want a lease. On December 19, in preparation for my lease expiring, I stopped in to see what Toyota of Plano had to offer. Although I would normally deal with the Loyalty Program Adviser, Sales Agent Greg Murrah had reached out to me because his research showed the end of my lease approaching but still far off enough for me to make informed decisions. Greg's 27 years in a career of compassionate care immediately showed in his new career in auto sales. His strategy was to help me focus on what I really wanted; I was impressed that he had done his homework to show me just the vehicles immediately available that met my criteria. After looking around and meeting also with Sales Manager, Mirza Begovic, the three of us quickly struck a mutually agreeable deal. Within a few hours, I was in and out with the key to my dream vehicle,  I find Mark Miller, whom I call ""The Closer,"" highly personable, candid, and trustworthy. He is focused on the best interests of the customer, what works best for me, not focused on adding to the bottom line.

He introduced me to Bill Gironda and they agreed to check it out for me.  Monday, they came back to me and said there was a few items that should  be replaced, which they replaced at no cost to us.  The thoroughness and pride they took to verify things like looking at balljoint boots cracked and replaced them, really impressed me.  Most dealerships would not have replaced the parts that they did and I will say this truck could have been sold as it was traded in, it was that nice and sound of a vehicle.

He immediately started speaking us in Spanish, and walked us through the whole purchasing process with professionalism, patience and transparency. Although we did not end up buying the car we were expecting to, because it was above our budget, he gave us an option that we loved, and fit our budget nicely. We could not find anyone who could babysit our two little kids that day, and we brought them with us, and Antonio was very empathetic, and gave us a cute carfax coloring book, and would even help us calm the kids down when they were fuzzy, in a nice, non invasive and gentle way. We always felt in good hands. I am not a car expert, and I kept asking him questions about the car features, and the credit process, and the payment breakdown, and he was open and patient enough to answer all my questions with full detail and very professionally.

This is the second vehicle that we buy from Toyota of Plano in the past 2 years as well as the second time that we had the honor to be attended by Anup. Yes, we had multiple choices in the area but we came back to this specific dealership because of the great service we had received before through Anup.
He made the deal possible and went beyond our expectations; he took the time to explain and answer our concerns and questions with a very professional attitude as well as knowledge. Anup delivered on his promises (very unheard of in this modern world of sales!) and all was ready when scheduled.
The exceptional service/parts department deserves a special mention here as well.

The dealership will treat you really well when you are purchasing a new car, but they will trash you afterward. I purchased a new prius 4 which the SAFETY feature is malfunction. I told them and the sales manager Moe had test drove it and acknowledged the problem as well. I went through a lot of hassles with their service department to just get it check up. Zach from the service department and their technician didn't even know how the PCS and ICS work. They claimed that the car doesn't have the safety features and the PCS system doesn't even break the car for you. So I had to do my research and educate them about the system. They inspected the car and told me there is nothing wrong with it, but I found out later that they just simply plugging it to a computer without properly test driving it and make sure that the safety feature works. I was looking for help from the managers (Moe, Noel, Kash), but they never return your call, and even if you visit them in person, they will try to make you wait in the lobby or just kept pushing responsibility to others. I was frustrated so I ended up calling Toyota and they said they will contact me in 2 business days which they didn't. Finally, Tony Pan called and scheduled a time with me, which I had to take time off from my work for the appointment. At the time of the appointment, I had to wait for more than an hour for him because they had a weekly meeting that he had to attend. Later, he didn't even apologize for the wait. Basically, they claimed that if the car doesn't show warning sign on the dashboard then it's fine. That's pretty much how they determine that if your car works or not.

A real good dealership is the one that provides excellent after-sales service like my saleswoman Bucks did, she did everything she could to help me resolve the issue and I truly appreciate her help. Toyota makes good cars that rarely have problem initially, so my advice for you is that you can still buy car from the dealership and hope there is nothing wrong with your car. If it does have problems, and they don't take care of you the first time, then just file complain with Toyota (800-331-4331). Don't waste your time to try to get help from the managers because they only care about their meetings and the sales but not the service. However, if you file a complain with Toyota, then they will contact you. Not because they care, it's because they have to.",1.2

1156,"October 25, 2017","We were shopping used cars for my son's first vehicle.  Having been all over town and seen dealers that represented all ranges of used car dealers from reputable to horrible, I can honestly say Patrick at Toyota of Plano was not only professional and honest, he really went the extra mile to make sure the details were taken care of and really worked with us, even though we were not buying a super high end car.  He made sure the car we were wanting to test drive was in fact, the car that was waiting for us at the designated time to test drive (no last minute switch-er-oo as some tried to pull off), and even made sure we knew how to get there and not to be confused between their two different lots across 190 from each other.   His management called to confirm we had a decent experience with sincerity, not just ""give us a 10 when they call.""  There was none of that.  I feel we got a fair price for a certified vehicle that should last us for years to come.  I would highly recommend this dealership over other Toyota dealers in the DFW area.",4.8

1159,"October 24, 2017","Even though Ali was very nice and considerate, I had a terrible, stressful experience with multiple staff. There was confusion over whether or not the car I wanted was available. At first I was told the dealership would cover the cost of a rental car until we could confirm (my old car was being repaired), but then I was told I would have to pay for the rental and then they would reimburse me. They weren't sure how long it would take to confirm availability. But they would only reimburse me for two days or else they would charge me for the additional time. Then I was told I needed to pay the down payment for the car, but there was confusion over the amount and what limits they could accept via debit or credit. Finally they said I didn't need to make the whole down payment, only a portion. There were separate conversations and paperwork for siloed parts of the organization -- sales, service, and rental. I was at the dealership for more than five hours, and throughout, I got changing information and was generally treated like they didn't trust me. I finally decided that, even if the car were available, I didn't want to deal with this organization in the future. I have since gone to a different dealership and the experience couldn't have been more different -- respectful, considerate, and treated me like a human being. The new dealership offered twice the trade-in amount that Toyota of Plano offered. So glad I didn't settle.",1.8

1168,"October 13, 2017","We had been going from dealership to dealership looking for a car for my daughter, (who was looking for her ""first"" car).

We had test drove many, some good, some not as good. 
When we walked in to Toyota we were greeted nicely, just like at all the others...
But the BIGGEST difference was Ethan listened to us, was SUPER knowledgable, and didn't waste our time trying to just ""make a deal"".
. 
After Ethan listening to what we wanted in a car and the price we wanted to stay around, he took us on a test drive in a car that met those criteria's, explaining ALL the newest safety features.  That was impressive!

We loved the car, but now...(Where other dealerships lost me...the price- AND...the even worse part...the back and forth I went through and the promises at the beginning, that they had seemed to forget when buying... that I had experienced at other car dealerships)...

After discussing what we both thought was fair... Ethan came back with $5 less then what we had even discussed!  When does that happen?  Ethan did EVERYTHING I had hoped for when buying a car AND MORE! I said..""Where do I sign!""

He educated us on, not only the car and all of it's updated features, but ratings, etc. and much more.
We left the dealership, not only with a car we loved, but the price we felt that was fair, and Ethan treated us like family, NOT just another sale.  

I ""WILL"" tell everyone I know looking for that type of car, WHERE to go and to let Ethan and Francisco take care of you. 

THANKS for a GREAT experience!

I honestly didn't wake up in the morning thinking I was going to do something as crazy as buy a new car. I originally set up an appointment with Alex just to see how much my '05 Highlander would get me in trade-in value. After spending some time with Ethan going over the benefits of investing in a new car (right down to the personal finance level), I couldn't help but feel more and more comfortable with the idea. He avoided the textbook hard-sale approach where money is the end goal and instead connected with me on a more personal level to give me the best possible option. After a quick test drive and a rundown of my financing options, I knew signing was the right call. The finance manager, Francisco Perez eased my mind further by giving me a full breakdown of everything I'm getting with the new car and everything I'm paying into.

One small thing - Fuel gauge was on E when we test drove. When the car was made ready to go it was only filled up half way. I don't think a full tank was part of our deal, but 1/2 a tank only?

1232,"September 07, 2017",I researched extensively and decided to purchase a 2017 Toyota Highlander Limited Platinum. I started looking around for the vehicle I wanted and interacted with four Toyota dealerships. I found the vehicle I wanted and contacted Max for further information. I was on the defensive at first because of having interacted with a less than honest dealership that played shell games on pricing. Max was a breath of fresh air. He honestly and directly answered my questions and offered me a fair deal for the exact vehicle I wanted. I highly recommend Max and Toyota of Plano.  ,5.0
1233,"September 07, 2017",We went to the Toyota dealership to lease a car. Sama Hawileh's customer service was excellent. She really cared about us as customers and spent a lot of time getting to know us. She provided valuable suggestions on vehicles and options on leasing. She also provided us enough time to make the right decision and did not push anything on us. Sama also went above and beyond to get us a good price for leasing the vehicle and made sure to check in with us after we leased it. Her follow up also made a huge difference as very few people actually take the time to do it. That really shows how much she cares about her customers.

1234,"September 07, 2017","I visited Toyota of Plano yesterday to have my wife's 2011 Rav 4 serviced.  It was due to a factory recall on the windshield wiper motor assembly.  Made this appointment a little over 2 weeks ago and the woman I spoke to at the time told me she would have to make sure the part was available before she could schedule the service.  She did that and we agreed on 9/6 being the day I would come in.  SO, I arrived for my appointment, spoke with my service advisor, Carlos, and...guess what?  NO PART.  He was very apologetic and said that the part may have been delayed because of Hurricane Harvey since they get a lot of their stuff from Houston.  Maybe so.  But, my appointment was CONFIRMED, part on hand, before the storm made landfall.   Even giving them the benefit of the doubt, they should have called me and told me there was no part available BEFORE I wasted my time and a half day of work showing up for a bogus appointment. I was on the phone with Lone Star Toyota of Lewisville  before I left the parking lot.  I have an appointment with them next week.",1.0

1236,"September 06, 2017","Several weeks ago, I made the decision to purchase a new vehicle. As a long time Honda fan, my first inclination was to purchase another. After doing some research and looking around, the RAV4 caught my eye. I reached out to Faz Imam at Toyota of Plano and he referred me to Karen Schlatterer. On Labor Day I had an appointment with Karen and explained my situation. She was amazingly patient and educated me on the options. After understanding all of my options, we decided on particular model of RAV4. Karen let me test drive several different vehicles and I finally decided on the one that was right for me. We then worked the numbers and Karen was able to get the vehicle into the price range that I needed. After we completed the financial aspects and the car was detailed, Karen took the time to explain the features of the vehicle, sync my phone and set up the vehicle to my liking. Karen shared her personal mobile phone with me and told me to call her any time with questions. This was an amazing experience and Karen was awesome to work with. I would strongly recommend anyone looking for a new Toyota to visit Toyota of Plano and request Karen Schlatterer. Thank you Karen for making this car buying experience amazing!!!  ",5.0

1255,"August 27, 2017","I like the Toyota Plano dealership. It may be called as the first store of Toyota since the global headquarter of this international auto giant is right located at Plano, TX. The store is very closed to the city center and really convenient for customers to get around. 

Although it is not showily decorated, you can feel very comfortable in the lobby. It is clean, bright and well organized. 

Staffs are also polite and professional. Of them, I must express my thanks to Mr. Joe Salazar and his manager Mr. Kash Zaman.

Influenced by Manager. Zaman, Mr. Salazar is not a compelling salesperson. I mean Mr. Salazar tries all his best to help you find the sweetest purchase from you side rather than to sell something to you from his side. Not surprisingly, you may not really understand what you want from a lot of available options, at least sometimes. But Mr. Salazar can assist you in the process to reasonably discover your own requirements or constraints and make correct decisions. Whether this ends up into a purchase or not, you may happily find that you’ve settled down and cleared any entanglement. It is Mr. Salazar who solves the problems of you and wins the trust from you.  

This reminds me of the question posed by my professor of business class — Is it right to sell combs to monks? I was not able to truly access to the puzzle many years ago. But from Mr. Salazar now, I get aware of what the best answer is. Actually, it is pretty simple: for SHORT, it is yes; but for LONG, it is not.

This was our 3rd time we purchased from Toyota of Plano and had always had great experiences in the past including the Finance deals we had be given in 2003 and 2011 (2.9%). We were expecting the same kind of treatment in finance as we had been loyal customers and were told as we purchased a certified used Avalon we qualified for New car rates. Also our credit ratings are both over 335.
We were totally taken back when the Finance manager John started out by offering us a 4.89% rate as his best offer. He only came down to to 3.89%  which is still way above new car rates.  Bottom line is the next day we contacted our bank (Chase) and 30 minutes later they gave us a rate well below Toyota and we will save $712 over the life of the loan. Chase we arrange the payoff and and their rate  included appreciation for loyal Chase customers (Unlike the Toyota Finance Manager).

We felt that we were not treated by finance fairly and the dealership no longer values repeat customers by their actions.  We would go to Sal again in the future but we will shop at least 2 others dealers first. Also our feature dealings we will be expecting to do battle with finance as they have changed from they way we were treated in the past.",3.8

What I experienced at Toyota of Plano was far more than that. The customer service I received from Roberto was above and beyond more than I expected. This is the type of service I encourage at my place of employment. I am a first time buyer and would be dishonest if I said the thought of purchasing a new vehicle for the first time, wasn't a bit nerve-racking. I've heard all kinds of horror stories about car salesmen and the actual process of negotiating. Fortunately and to my surprise, my experience was nothing like that. 

Roberto took his time getting to know me and my needs. He is full of knowledge and answered questions I didn't even know I had! He is open and honest and really took his time, allowing me to ask questions and express my concerns. His upbeat personality and positive attitude are contagious! Roberto was a blessing in my experience and clearly a valuable part of his team. I never felt pressured and he never once made me feel as though I should be ready to resort to 'plan b' in the event things didn't go as planned. Roberto worked with his finance department to ensure that I was getting the best deal. Even after the deal was finalized with Francisco, Roberto made sure I was taken care of and had all of the resources I needed to care for my new car. Before I left, he also made sure I understood all of the features of my new car and helped me set up a few things, such as pairing my phone to my car through bluetooth. 

Being able to drive off confident with your purchase is a big part of excellent customer service. That afternoon I drove away happy and satisfied that I made a good purchase. I love my CHR and this experience is one I'll be sure to share more than once in the future. ",5.0

Sunny pulled up some comparable 2017's to let us know what the differences were.  There was a slight wait for paperwork because one of the persons was on vacation, so there was a little bottleneck, but luckily that gave us time to tire out our baby.

I kept repeating that I was only looking and not willing to buy that day, but the salesperson kept running off to the finance guy to ""see if he could make a deal"". I entertained him a few times, only for him to come back with a sad counter-offer that I would expect to be a starting-off point if they priced the cars according to their actual condition.

We advised the salesman that we would think it over and let him know the next day. I called on Wednesday morning to advise him that we would indeed purchase the Rav4 vehicle we had looked at the night before. I asked if I needed to do anything to secure the car that day and he said no actually it was his day off but he kept the keys with him and no worries that car would not be sold and I could pick up on Thursday. I said great I would be there between 3-4 on Thursday and he said he would have the car cleaned and ready by 2:30. I called at 2:30 to say I was on my way in Uber ride to pick up the car, was paying cash and would like to have a smooth process. He assured me it was ready, paperwork was done and I simply had to bring a check. When I arrived he showed me to his desk and presented me the paperwork. I was in process of writing the check when I noticed the MSRP amount on the worksheet was less than the MSRP amount on the car specifications we had been given on Tuesday evening but the selling price was the same. When I questioned him about why a difference he then advised me that it was a different car! I was taken completely by surprise and was astonished that he was about to let me buy a car that wasn't the car we had agreed upon. It turns out that the original car, despite his promise, had indeed been sold on Thursday before I arrived but he and/or the dealership management chose not to advise me of that circumstance. The car they were substituting had less features than the original car but I was left to discover that myself instead of them letting me know before I arrived to make the purchase. Once I caught the discrepancy the salesman was apologetic and offered to make it right but the point was they weren't going to do that until I noticed! And management apparently didn't care because we never heard anything from them. I did not buy the car because I felt their actions were deceitful.

Everything went well including the trade-in negotiations and the finance.  Would recommend Karen to any friend who wants to buy a Toyota.",4.8

1443,"June 08, 2017","The sole reason I ended up purchasing a new vehicle from Toyota of Plano was due to the salesperson, Karen Schlatterer.  The day that I sat down with her to discuss a deal, I never really expected to walk away with a signed deal in hand.  But, that’s what happened within the timeframe of 55 minutes.  When we sat down to talk, I knew exactly what I wanted in the vehicle and what a fair price should be.  Karen listened carefully to every detail of what I was requesting.  All in all, it took less than an hour, from our initial handshake, the exchange of pleasantries, and the discussion of the transaction to complete the deal.  I will definitely look forward to working with Karen Schlatterer again and be more than comfortable to recommend her to my friends.

With regard to the dealership itself, it is too soon for me to have an opinion.  The delivery process of the vehicle went reasonably well … although the dealership has some extreme ideas about how to title a vehicle in the name of a trust.

1461,"May 30, 2017","Yesterday I purchased a new Tacoma from Toyota of Plano.  The Tacoma was the second new vehicle my wife and I have purchased from Toyota of Plano dealership.  Our 2012 Camry was purchased new as well.  The amazing part about both of those experiences was that Mark Miller was involved with both purchase.  In 2012 Mark was a salesman and yesterday he was the finance manager that put together the paperwork for the Tacoma.  

For the second time Mark displayed his professionalism and friendly personality.  The first time he sold us a new car he made such an impression that when we went back for the second new vehicle my wife pulled his business card from 5 years ago and asked that I look him up.  Turns out I did not have to look him up .  He remembered my wife and I when i went into his office.  

Mark and I talked about how our families were doing, how our professional lives had changed and about how good it was to reconnect.  During this process of reconnecting Mark never slowed down in putting the financial package together for my signatures and he never failed to explain every paper I had to sign.  It is always refreshing when working with a true professional.

I have been a little long winded when all I really needed to say about Mark...the best.  Thanks Mark.  My wife and I wish you only the best in your future endeavours with Toyota of Plano.

I had come in on Wednesday afternoon with my wife looking for a Toyota iM and the initial sales rep we had possibly thought we were not serious buyers and we did not feel treated as though so we left and headed for Toyota of Dallas. Long story short we returned on Thursday and Peter came to us and took a lot of time with us going round the lot of the hail damaged cars until he found this Black Beauty with minimal damage. We didn't but on that day.  I called Peter up early Friday morning and was on the phone back and forth with him the whole day negotiating a gear deal.  Now keep in mind sale reps don't want to take the time to deal with someone who is not there in person, but truth be told the whole deal was conducted over the phone and we just came in for the paperwork.
Peter is just a fantastic guy and wife and really love him and so does our 20 month son who he played with and let run around the dealership.

With my busy schedule, Karen continuously followed up with me by scheduling appointments to fit my schedule. Karen is very patient, professional and a pleasure to work with. Karen's customer service skills continued after I purchased my vehicle. For example, I purchased a pre-owned car with some small scratches/dings on the back bumper. Karen assured me that it can be removed. The day I was going to pick up my car, Karen would not let me take it home and sent it back to the service department. Karen said the bumper was supposed to be smoother without any residue on it. Karen is very persistent about making sure things are done the right way and that is what I admire about her.

After making a few phone calls, I decided I would try a few other dealers that could offer me a lower price than MSRP. 
After thanking Taylor for his help, I let him know I needed to shop around for a better price and would contact him if I had any questions. At this point his attitude completely changed. He began bullying me by saying ""This deal is only good today"", ""What's there to even think about?"". Taylor even said to me ""Why did you even come in today?"" I was shocked at the way he would treat a potential customer. After walking me to the door, his parting words were ""Thanks for wasting my time.""

I have never been so disrespected by a salesperson in my life. If there was even a small chance of me returning later, that door was completely closed now. Taylor Armstrong will lie to get you into the dealership only to throw a temper tantrum if you don't like his offers. I will never recommend this dealership to anyone and I hope the general manager understands that one of his own employees is costing him sales.",1.0

We found Jim to be very personable and knew his inventory. We had called Jim the evening before to set up a time to meet with him. It wasn't long before my wife had decided on a car. We decided on a used 2016 Toyota Avalon for my wife. Only 22k miles on it. We also had brought our 2008 Cadillac CTS in for a trade-In. We had an issue in that we could not open the trunk of the Cadillac. One of Toyota's mechanics (RAY MORALES) removed the back seats and was able to get the trunk opened and found a cable was broken. We wheeled and dealed a little while and pretty soon the deal was to our satisfaction. We went on with the financial portion of the deal with John Fulgoni and concluded that process fairly quickly as well. My wife is very happy with her 2016 Avalon. Thank you Jim and Toyota of Plano!

Nope, nor answer the question. Instead I call back weeks later, and ask once again. Even worse, I asked another question that I need to know about my new car. Does it matter?

1775,"January 10, 2017","My wife and I started our day at another dealership where we had previously scheduled an appointment to test drive a vehicle. We had done our research, did not need financing and were ready to take the vehicle home if the test drive went well. After driving an hour to Rockwall, we were incredibly upset to find out the sales manager whom we had been previously scheduled our appointment with, was too busy for us and instead sent us to another salesman who had no idea why we were there. In addition, the vehicle was no where to be found. Instead, the dealership was more interested in trying to place us in another vehicle on their lot. Even though this was a large dealership with great online reviews, we no longer had any interest doing business with them. We instead left and contacted Forkan (who we had previously spoken with). Even though this was a very busy Saturday, Forkan invited us to stop by and ensured us he would assist. He greeted us at the door and even though we dropped by last minute, he spent a tremendous amount of time listening to what we wanted. He understood we had a budget, were not interested in financing and he spent time searching for the perfect vehicle for us. We didn't tell Forkan of our experience earlier in the day, but he treated us as if we had. His expertise, honesty and integrity was everything missing from his competitor and we appreciated him very much. The only reason I could not give a full 5 stars is not Forkan's fault, but rather the dealership's. Even though we weren't financing, they still ran our credit. I guess I could let that go because we wrote a check and I imagine the company would at least like to have some confidence in accepting such payment in full for a vehicle. However, we also had to wait for the finance officer to work through the 'folders' of other buyers. This took forever and quite honestly, seemed completely unnecessary. With that said, I will certainly tell my friends and family to contact Forkan at once when they are looking to buy their next vehicle. ",4.2

Told me that he will do oil change today and bring car during some other day for rest of the services.
I told him that in my call i mentioned all three items very clearly to the lady who took my call, if she has missed why should i suffer.

Toyota shall go thru my call on 12/9 and see if i mentioned all three services.

AC fluctuating and not working sporadically during winter is a risk, as the windshield glass blurs out.
Still they did not want to help me out.

Finally, i decided to take it to a different dealer in Richardson, told the same to the service person.
He said fine and left me in the line.
I was stuck there in line between cars standing before me without drivers and behind me.
The service guy left, finally i catch hold of another service person asked him to help clear cars before me.
Took a while for them to clear my way out.",1.0

This was my 4th new car purchase and first at a Toyota dealership. My time with Jeremy makes me wish my previous 3 had been with him and Toyota. I've never felt more taken care of than I was with Jeremy. Jeremy treated me the way I want to be treated when I visit a car dealership. There was no pressure put on me to spend more than I was comfortable with and Jeremy made me feel like I'd been a loyal customer my entire life. He listened to all of my wants and tried his very best to deliver on everything I wanted. I've never had someone work as hard as he did to ensure that I got the price I wanted as opposed to trying to up sale me and push me into a price range that I was uncomfortable with. Many times in the past, I've spent HOURS dealing with sales guys trying to agree on a price. Jeremy was cognizant of my time crunch and did his very best to get me in and out as quickly as he could. This was the easiest car buying experience I have ever been through and I would HIGHLY recommend anyone looking for a new Toyota to visit Jeremy Miller at Toyota of Plano. ",5.0

When I got back home I began looking on Auto Trader and from the postings I could see that Toyota of Plano had a wide selection in the price range I thought I could afford for a dependable used car.   I said a little prayer and sent an e-mail to the dealership to inquire about one of the cars in particular.  I was soon contacted by Sal Rodriguez and told him my situation.  I told him I was without transportation and he offered to have someone pick me up.  I was able to get a rental and called back to make an appointment.  We test drove the car and I was confident I had found my new vehicle.  I was somewhat concerned about financing because I had just helped my son purchase a vehicle, but he assured me it would not be a problem.  Sal is a very compassionate, understanding person and reassured me every step of the way.  It was hard to believe that only a little over 48 hours after my car had broken down I was driving home in a beautiful, low mileage Camry.

1869,"December 02, 2016","To Whom It May Concern:

“Service is our business!”  “We pride ourselves on the service we provide!”  These examples of the many clichés that consumers hear everyday, and yes, we remain hopeful that someday, a merchant will truly live up to the standards that they purport in their advertisements.  However, too often we, the customers, are left dissatisfied and disappointed.  Very seldom do we find individuals who attain that special quality that we are hungry for – QUALITY SERVICE.  It is like a breath of fresh air and a feeling that you matter and are viewed as more than “another sale”.  I am so happy to report that I have encountered an individual who has provided me with that breath of fresh air, in the person of Kash Zaman.

When I entered the parking lot of Plano Toyota I expected the sales personnel to be a replication of two other Toyota dealerships I had just encountered.  After finding someone to assist me, the first salesman had no knowledge of the vehicle I wanted and the other was too busy trying to answer other calls and get to the Thanksgiving lunch.  Mr. Zaman, however, greeted me in the parking lot, and after exchanging pleasantries (yes, he asked my name); he proceeded to invite me into his cubicle offered beverages to my wife and me.  He did this in such a hospitable way, and more than once he inquired about our comfort.  Mr. Zaman listened to my request and desires and engaged me with his vast knowledge of the vehicles that would meet my request.  He offered pros and cons and did not use “strong arm” tactics of persuasion.

After getting a full understanding of our desires and lifestyle, Mr. Zaman took us onto the lot to show us vehicles that he felt would meet our needs.  It was obvious that he was fully aware of the operational systems of the vehicles on the lot, but he explained everything in simple non-condescending terms.  Mr. Zaman worked with us without interruption and made us feel that we were his most important assignment of the day.

Why do I say Mr. Zaman represents the epitome of customer service?  He dealt with me as though I was a relative.  He was personable, hospitable, charming, kind, caring, and concerned.  I purposely waited to see if I would ever here from Mr. Zaman again.  Since our meeting, he has sent me three email messages and left me a wonderful message on my telephone to see if I had questions, but more so, to see if I was satisfied.

I had no intention of buying a car last week because I usually do a lot of investigating of the information I receive from salesman because of past experiences.  However, this young man has renewed my hope in mankind.  Toyota is fortunate to have an employee like Kash Zaman.  This endorsement comes from one who was in government customer service for over thirty-eight years.

I had dropped by the dealership early 8:30-9:00am only to see if they had what I was looking for.

From the beginning to the end of the transaction he was there to help me through the entire process.

At this time, we had indicated to our Service Advisor that we would soon be in the market for a new vehicle lease or purchase.  Ethan wasted no time in introducing himself, answering our questions regarding moving forward with a new transaction, and following up to ensure that all of our needs were met within the required timing.

As a direct result of Ethan's salesmanship abilities, relationship-building skills, and willingness to please, we elected to lease a new 2017 Rav4 LE from him, even though our previous lease agreement was facilitated through a competing area dealership.

Finally, Ethan did not only show us the Owner's Manual, but also took the extra time to personally show us the features of the vehicle and how to successfully navigate them.

Historically, we have negotiated many vehicles through Toyota, the majority of which were handled with Toyota of Plano.  With top notch sales and service like what we've just experienced, why should we go elsewhere?  We are satisfied and loyal repeat customers.  Thank you so much for taking such great care of us!

My wife already has a 2012 Camry so no need to test drive,  Although I liked the vehicle I  was interested in I told him I wanted to look at a car at a another Toyota dealership for my own peace of mind. He said fine, he understood. Again, no pressure. I went to the other Toyota dealership and received the worst experience I have had in any sales experience ever. I won't go into detail but it went bad right from the greeting. Needless to stay I didn't stay long. I headed back to Toyota of Plano and called Ken and told him I was on my way back. We met and I told him I wanted to ""talk numbers"". We sat down and he was very honest, straightforward and professional. I felt at ease.

1969,"October 29, 2016","I went in to Toyota of Plano Friday afternoon (bout 5pm). I was greeted almost instantly by Salesman Moe. He carried an infectious smile and seemed ready to work. Prior to my visit I had done my homework and had narrowed my choices to 4-5 trucks which I had the vin #s for them. Moe invited me to a beverage while He took a few minutes and located the vehicles. 
Within about 10 minutes he had them located and took me outside to the lot. After seeing the vehicles I had narrowed my choices to 2 vehicles. We jumped in a 4wd and took it for a spin. I was sold!
Upon return Moe took my information and went to work with the sales manager. Within minutes we had an agreed down payment and they began to work payment options. 
Within the next 10-15 minutes I was personally greeted by the Main sales manager and the finance manager. This truly was a clean and smooth process. While I went in with the finance manager, Moe had my new truck detailed and prepped for departure.
All in all I spent 2.5 hours at the dealership. (super fast compared to 5-6 other experiences at other dealerships and brands.) Moe took the time to sync my phone to the electronics and even walked me through every feature to ensure my understanding. I drove away completely satisfied with my experience and my new truck.",5.0

One of Max’s fortes is his friendly and pleasant demeanor coupled with his great knowledge of Toyota products.  He responded to all my calls and emails promptly and was upfront on every aspect of leasing a car.  From my first interaction with him, I knew I was dealing with a consummate professional who loved what he did.  He went the extra mile to ensure I will be a lifelong customer rather than a transactional one.  The rest of the team at the dealership also deserves praise.

1972,"October 28, 2016","MY name is Yaw Poku and I have been a customer of Park Place Motors and Sewell Lexus for the past 10 years. Recently, I was able to find a car at a Toyota Dealership named Toyota of Plano. I called initially inquiring about a Toyota Tundra I saw on CARS.COM for a phenomenal price of 31000 with only 17,000 miles. When I called the representative whom answered was Forkan Siddique. From the moment I spoke to his courteous voice I could tell that this dealership was the one I needed to go visit. 5 months prior I bought a 2014 Tundra Limited Crewcab from another dealership that had basically screwed me on the pricing. However Forkan was able to share some valuable information with me about this transaction and gave me the best pricing for a the trade in to upgrade to a Crewmax. The transaction was smooth, I felt confident with the answers he gave me about my questions and reservations. I was so excited about my purchase that was taking place. the finance person was AMAZING also. I am relieved that I purchased my truck from them and I am now and will forever be adding TOYOTA OF PLANO to my recommendation lists to my cohort, colleagues, and family.

1976,"October 27, 2016","Before I get into my experience with Toyota of Plano’s sales professional let me confess my bias. Through purchasing automobiles over the last fifty years and dealing with car salesman, I have developed a pretty negative attitude towards them.  The list of things I would rather do than deal with a car salesman is pretty much endless and it includes things like having oral surgery. So that expresses my state-of-mind or bias when I pulled up in Toyota of Plano’s parking lot for the meeting.
My wife and I had really only stopped by to test drive of their Highlanders but it became clear within a minute that this was going to be much different than I had expected. 
This well dressed and pleasant young fellow met us before we entered.  He introduced himself and asked how he could help.  And he did.  As a matter of fact, he was so helpful I was shocked.  He listened very well and guided us down the paths we were interested in and nothing else.  He was well spoken and knowledgeable about his products.  He understood what we were not interested in pursuing and he didn’t even try to go down those roads.  I walked in the door at 9:00 AM and drove out at 4:15 PM.  We took a break for lunch but other than that, he spent the entire time assisting us.
We had decided upon the model, features, and options we wanted in a new car before we met him.  He found the vehicle and trim that perfectly matched our specification.  Then a curve ball.  My wife decided she really would rather have a different color.  No problem for Kash.  He searched in their huge inventory until he found not only another match in the desired color combination but an upgrade to the Limited (top of the line) car with a pot-full of desirable features we didn’t even know we wanted.  And he found it for the same price. How can you beat that?  
Easy choice for us.  We purchased the car and Kash spent more than an hour with me going through the Entune Premium Audio and multimedia system.
I’ll just say this.  My experience with Kash Zaman could not possibly have been any better.  Forget that I purchased the car I wanted, it was just a pleasure to find someone who was so genuinely honest, capable, friendly, a patient.  That’s a pretty good specification according to me.  He shattered my bias.
Since purchasing the car, Kash has called several times just to see if he could help us in any way; never pushy, just wants to continue helping.  Exceptional.
I will recommend him to any friend I know who might be looking for a car and a good experience finding one.  I would give a hearty recommendation of Kash Zaman to you as well.

I had never leased a vehicle before but he patiently explained all the details about leasing.   We decided to lease the car. After completing all the paperwork, Kash demonstrated how to use all the car features. We are very happy dealing with Kash at Toyota of Plano.

1989,"October 25, 2016","I did months of research on the Tacoma Sport before I bought, yet I was very impressed and humbled with Taylor's product knowledge.  He went on to show me in detail all of the new technology in my new 4x4 as well as the new features and upgrades vs my old 07 Tacoma.  If I were in the new car business, I would want about 10 ""Taylor""s to work for me,  I believe that with the product that Toyota sells these days, and a few Taylors demonstrating their high value, that I would be a huge success.  In a nutshell, Taylor did his job extremely well.

Unfortunately Taylor works for a dealership for which I have an incredibly low opinion.  I've owned 5 Toyotas now, and have had more trouble purchasing this 1 truck than purchasing the other 4 combined.  I made what is considered a decent purchase on my Tacoma, but I foolishly passed up a really good deal on another Tacoma based on the words of TOYOTA OF PLANO salesmen.  Lots of mistakes were made, mostly by the salesmen, and I wound up paying for their mistakes. One  person makes me an offer, I seal the deal with a 1000 deposit, a second salesman follows up because the 1st salesman leaves and tells me he will honor the deal  One month later the sales manager tells me it cannot be done.  At the end of the day, this dealership would not hold itself accountable for the things a dealership representative says  Meanwhile, my original deal at the other dealership was lost.  IMHO, no one acted illegally, but I feel that they acted unethically.  In retrospect, I should have bought the same vehicle elsewhere.  I will be submitting complaints to the BBB and Plano chamber of commerce and anyone else who will listen.",1.8

2031,"October 05, 2016","My husband and I just moved to Dallas from Chicago and needed a second car. We shopped at a couple place, both online and in person, looked at different makes and models, even test drove at another dealership. None of them provide the level of service, expertise and professionalism Jay Lee at Toyota Plano did. We got there at 7pm on a weekday, and was immediately greeted by Jay. We were looking at a hybrid version of the model we were considering and Jay explained to us how to evaluate the cost benefits of a hybrid. I was amazed by his candidness vs just trying to close a deal quickly. He stayed late, let us test drive multiple trims of cars, and yet never rushed us to buy. When we eventually did, he was the one who pointed out a miniature scrape on the back bumper (which no one would have noticed) and of course promptly scheduled us to have it repaired. Just an honest sales professional that you unfortunately don't see often in the industry. Highly recommend this dealership and Jay Lee in particular! ",5.0

After the test drive he gave us best offers and price that beats other dealers. we signed all the paper work and now i'm driving beautiful 2017 Toyota Rav4.

First of all, my sales rep, Forkan Siddique, was excellent.  He helped me over the course of a few days and handled everything professionally.  Decided on a vehicle, got a check from my bank, and presented it to Forkan.  They needed a copy of my drivers' license and insurance which I provided.  They needed more info so I had to fill out a form.

Turns out the form was a Toyota branded Credit Application.  I filled out my name, address, and phone number.  They wanted me to provide SSN and sign the app.  I declined to provide my SSN and sign the Toyota Credit application.

Management came over said everything was all set but I needed to sign the credit app.  I was informed that company policy requires a signed credit application to purchase a car at Toyota of Plano - even if I have my own payment method.  I again declined since I had already provided them payment.  Manager stated he could not sell me the car.  Since we could not complete the sale, I asked for the check back, thanked Forkan for all his help, and left the dealership.

No problems with employees - just a problem with stated ""company policy"" that cost them a sale

2081,"September 14, 2016","This is a follow up to my initial review of purchasing my 2016 Toyota Highlander from this dealership. A day after driving my SUV home, I realized it didn't have windshield washer fluid. I opened the hood and found the washer reservoir was empty. I filled the reservoir with fluid and all of it emptied on my garage floor. I called the dealer, spoke to the sales person and service manager and explained my new car problem. I was told the service dept was super busy and to make an appointment. I made an appointment for 9/14/16, which was 3 days from the day I called. When I took my brand new Highlander to the service dept I was told they didn't have the part in stock! 

I'm officially a dissatisfied customer now. At first I gave Toyota of Plano a great rating. Now that I have a problem with my BRAND new SUV, the great service suddenly disappeared. FIRST, I should not have been sold a new car with an empty washer reservoir. Seems to me, an inspection should occur on every car before it's pulled off their lot. SECOND, when I called and spoke to the service dept and gave great levels of details regarding my problem, the service manager at minimum should have made sure they had that part available before having me drive 25 miles back to their location. THIRD, there has been no mention of compensating me for my inconvenience nor for this unfortunate mistake. Something as simple as providing me a loaner, until this issue is fixed would have been great. When I asked for a loaner car, I was told they only have shuttles.

Needless to say, no one that I personally spoke with took ownership of my problem. I will personally make sure this issue is resolved because I spent $50k in that dealership AND SHOULD NOT HAVE AN ISSUE WITH A BRAND NEW VEHICLE! As a side note, the service advisor I worked with today (Travis), was extremely kind & courteous. He is at the tail end of this ordeal, so my complaint doesn't include him.

As of today, I change my original rating of this dealership (was 5 stars). I can not in good faith recommend anyone to purchase a car from them, due to issues with my NEW vehicle and declining service after the deal is closed. No one and nothing is perfect (even though they want you to rate your experience with them perfectly), but how one handles problems separates them from the rest. Good customer service is invaluable, and it should start at the moment a customer walks in the door, and well after they purchase a car.

I brought each issue to the supervisor/service advisors attention and they handled each problem accordingly.  Service Advisor Judy Deems is very attentive to your needs.  My wife is pregnant and Judy made sure she would be taken care of.  Service Manager Doug Brown is great to work with.  I didn’t have to haggle or argue or plead my case in any situation.

I have been with toyota since my first Corolla in 2008, my current Camry is my 4th Toyota car. I have been to service centers in three states CA / AZ / NE, never faced such an experience before.

The lady in service who takes the payment showed worst attitude - pls train or replace these kind of people with bad attitude from customer facing roles. She represents Toyota in the minds of customer. 
I just a second back signed my credit card, the ink is still wet and i didn't even get my keys yet but she was so impatient to address my question on one of the charges. 
She said ""you have already made payment and we have checked you out"" i asked her i am still standing before you waiting for my keys, why can't you address this.

The service coupon for alignment is still valid till 8/31/16 : http://www.toyotaofplano.com/service-coupon-1.htm, but no one is ready to honor it. 
Not honoring a promise is one thing and not treating a customer with due respect is the worst part i couldn't digest. I made an expense of $1400 in a day and she was not ready to discuss about $20 difference.

Coming to the service, the car was with the service center from 9am to 6pm, service made was rack/pinon replacement and wheel alignment. The alignment is worse than before, wheel is tilting to left and shaky while driving, took it back to the center within 15mins and no one is even ready to take a look or test ride. 
They have asked me to come back again tomorrow. Now i have to waste my business hours during another working day for their bad job. 
How hard it is to do a test ride and fixing it properly before calling it job done.

Am going to take this to all Toyota forums. This is a brand i adore. Feel bad people like these let it tarnish.

2143,"August 25, 2016","My wife and I, took our Toyota RAV4 in to have a transmission leak looked at. We were told that it would be $643 dollar fix which is a significant cost when you have a baby on the way. After the quoted time for the repair had past, we eventually got in contact with of our service rep Travis Watters and went to pick up our vehicle the next day. 3 miles of driving our newly ""repaired"" vehicle, we were having issues with the transmission not shifting out of first gear which it had not done before the ""repair"" so we took it back to the dealership. The new issue was that the transmission was going to have be replaced at the cost of $3200, it was at this time that Travis told us it had not be test driven as it should have been after the ""repair"". The only consolation given to us at this point was that they would include the $642 into the cost of the new repair or refund us the $642. After speaking with Mitch Congdon (the service director) we were told being offered the $642 was already generous on their part and that the issue was due to a pre-existing issue (one that they must have been clueless about at the time of the initial inspection of the vehicles transmission). Mitch was unwilling to provide details on how such an oversight by the mechanic would have been possible and was now stating that the post repair test drive had been completed with no notable issue (we consulted outside transmission shops and they stated that when the transmission fluid pan was dropped to have the fluid removed, there would have been noticeable signs to reveal the bigger transmission issue such as metal flakes in the fluid or other signs of degradation). The solution that Mitch and his team still leaned on was giving us our money back to get rid of us or to have us give them more money to fix the problem they created.

I can't say how things would have gone if I had tried to walk away without purchasing, maybe they would have started to pour on the traditional high pressure tactics, but I didn't get that impression.   Stephan was very friendly, he showed me exactly what I was looking for and didn't try to re-direct me to a more expensive model or one with more features than I wanted.   He was knowledgeable about the details of the vehicles and how to use the features and had a relaxed attitude.   The finance person was also very nice to work with and really a great guy.   They ended up selling me a car that was a year newer, had less mileage and had more features for the same price as a vehicle at the #1 used car dealership in the US that has fixed prices.  So just because it is a traditional dealership doesn't mean the prices aren't competitive.

He was very anxious to meet our needs without being overly aggressive.  He was prompt and professional in answering questions following our initial meeting.  While others seem to be guessing or ""B.S. ing"", Brian knew his product exceptionally well.  The only problem we had with this dealership was inaccurate information on the website. When, ""clicking through"" for detailed information about our vehicle, the wrong description was given.  While the information was about the Sienna model, the descriptive material was about a different trim level (one that was above the level we were checking out).  This left us very confused about what features were available on the model we chose. However, we did ultimately purchase that vehicle.

2274,"July 21, 2016","On Friday, July 15, 2016, my friend & I drove to Honda of Burleson to look at a specific car. That was the worse experience that I could have imagined. I was completely turned off by the car buying process & was sure that I would undergo the same treatment at my next car lot. I called Toyota of Plano to check on a 2013 Toyota Camry SE that I had seen on AutoTrader. I spoke with Sunny & when I asked him if I was going to be charged extra for the ""Certified Pre Own"" advertised vehicle that I was interested in, he emphatically stated, ""we do not operate like that!"" I was so happy to hear that! When I arrived at Toyota of Plano (ToP), I was greeted by Dennis, who told me Sunny asked him to work with me. I asked to see the car & then went to test drive the car. Dennis was extremely personable. I explained to him what I had experienced the day before & he explained to me that such practice was frowned upon at ToP. Every question that I asked about the car, he answered. I went to ToP alone, something I had never done before, & was completely at ease working with Dennis. I went to get my sister so that she can see the car & ask her own questions. She was impressed with Dennis' service as well. I also had the pleasure of meeting Shane, he was very nice & understood my situation. He was kind enough to work with me. When it came time to go to financing, Tony came to help me with all my paperwork. They were a person short on Saturday & Tony did not want us to wait. He was very accommodating & we were very impressed with him taking time to not waste our time by having us wait.

I picked up my car yesterday & Dennis was there to open the door. He walked the car with me to make sure that it was to my liking. I can honestly say that I did not feel as though as I was working with a salesperson, I felt as though I was working with my uncle. I am confident saying that I felt that Dennis had my best interest in mind. I am very happy with my experience & my purchase. I will definitely recommend Toyota of Plano & specifically Dennis Woodard to every & anyone that I know in need of a Certified Preowned vehicle.

2332,"June 30, 2016","I had the worst car purchasing experience in all my lifetime. The sales representative at this dealership are very RUDE, UNETHICAL and UNPROFESSIONAL. If this site allowed it, I would have given them a negative rating.

Here is my experience:-
I was in the process to buy a new 2016 RAV4 LE model and contacted this dealership through the Internet pricing of edmunds.com . I was then contacted by a sales representative Shams Asrani with a quote. I had earlier received a better quote from Toyota of Lewisville of $23,064 which I forwarded to him so that he may match the price, which he agreed to after consulting with his manager. However, I received a call from Ivan Funes from Lewisville that he will reduce $500 more on it. I told shams this fact and he said they will beat any deal Lewisville gives them.

So I went to Toyota of Plano on 24th June around 6pm. Here is what happened:-
The price they offered was $22,900 ,offered by Deepak Rathor, on which I said that I have a better price and tried to negotiate a bit to reduce it somewhat and get the best price. I then asked about the Graduate rebate on offer from Toyota to get an additional $750 off, on which Deepak said that you can only take that if you take financing with Toyota.

On the financing part Carlos Lazo said that the best he can offer was 3.5% APR which I refused to take as I already had a 1.99% APR approved from a credit union so I said let me take one final look before of the car before making the deal. I went out and checked the car and decided I will pitch in for $22,800 if they don't agree I will go with $22,900 and pick the car. When I  come back a senior of Shams (I didn't get the name) came and said to me ""THERE WILL BE NO BUSINESS. WE CAN'T DO BUSINESS WITH YOU "".
 
This was the most insulted and humiliated I ever felt in my life. I urge you people to not visit this dealership.

I ended up buying the car from Lewisville on 25th June 2016. Here is summary:-
1. Got the car at $22,250 with College Grad rebate.
2. Got 0% APR financing with 0 down payment.

In the end, I would like to thank Toyota of Plano for 'NOT DOING BUSINESS WITH ME' as I ended up getting a much better deal.    ",1.4

2377,"June 17, 2016","	Toyota has run in my family for several years, I suppose it’s safe to say, the purchase of a Toyota vehicle, is much like a family tradition. Since I myself was able to drive, I’ve driven nothing but Toyota/Lexus vehicles. My father has only ever driven Toyota Sequoias and my mother has owned 6 Toyota vehicles and is currently driving her 3rd Lexus. I think it’s safe to say that my family is loyal to Toyota, as their vehicles have provided safety and reliability. 
	I currently drive a 2014 Avalon. I bought my car in September of 2014 with 14,000 miles. I thought I was getting a great deal, as this is considered one of Toyota’s Luxury vehicles. To my disappointment, in the summer of 2015, several issues arose. The trim around the radio and cup holders began to flake. I live in Texas. The summers here are hot, so I decided to crack my windows to prevent the car from overheating. Unfortunately, when I returned, I was stunned to see the leather had bubbled up. Less than a year from purchasing this vehicle, the leather is severely cracked. This is not okay.  I took my vehicle to the dealership to get the trimming and leather seat fixed, only for your employees to tell me that this was my fault, in which they accused me of spilling a drink and that’s why the leather seat was ruined. A month later the radio started turning off inconveniently. I took time out of my day and my job, to take this car to the dealership. I was told they needed to update the software and that was the reason it wasn’t working properly. After having waited for four hours, I was told I need to make another appointment, because they had to order a new radio and were unable to perform the updates. This is unacceptable. After having brought my car back into the dealership to have the radio replaced and the software updated, currently to this day, I still have the same issue with the radio. Along with the continuous problems with my radio, two of the buttons on the driver side door, fell off and have stopped working. I contacted Travis at one of your dealerships, left 4 messages and after 2 months of attempting to contact, he finally calls me back. I made another appointment, for the radio and buttons, took time out of my day and my job and after having waited three hours I was told they had already replaced the radio and there was nothing they could do. I got my vehicle back, only to find they didn’t replace or fix the buttons on the driver door. Again this is unacceptable. What happened to customer service, because there was none at this location?
	I’d love to keep the purchasing of Toyota vehicles in my family, as a tradition. Although if Toyota cannot give me a reasonable explanation and or solution as to why my 2014 Avalon- Luxury Vehicle has had this many issues and why the issues have not been fixed, I can promise that my family will no longer contribute business to Toyota.

2421,"June 01, 2016","I got a complete  unprofessional and dis-respected treatment during my sales experience with Toyota of Plano.
I don't know how I should start this, I have been a Toyota customer for the last two years and I visited multiple dealerships but I have never got such unprofessional and dis-respectful treatment like the one I got at Toyota of Plano

Long story short , i would never buy a car from this Plano dealership in the future no matter what.



My Sales experience:

I agreed with the sales guy on the pricing before i showed up in the dealership to finish the paperwork and walk out with the car but this is not what happened , what happened is one of your sales manager ""Carlos""tried to rise the price of the car 500$ on me despite the fact I already agreed on the price previously.
When I refused to pay any extra money above the price that I signed up for, he started acting rude and I cant believed things he said to me starting with "" i am the in charge person in here nobody in this dealership going to sell you a car if I decide not to sell you"" , I replied to him gently ""its true, its your car and its your dealership and I don't have control over that but I got a better deal from other dealers which I am going to sign up for if you are not going to sell me the car with the price that I signed up for""

He made it worse when he accused me of lying in front of my wife and kids when he said ""This is not true, you have never gotten a better deal before and you wont get any and if you are going to walk away and not signing up for the risen price that I am offering you then It wont be valid anymore , in other word -he was threaten me that he will rise the price.
The man accused me of lying in front of my family/ it was unbelievable.


This is where i told him "" we are over here"" and i am not going to buy any car from somebody accused me of lying and that was totally inappropriate - i cant possibly believe that those guys treating their customers like that.

Anyway, The moment i walked out of the dealership , I visited toyota of lewisville where I got a better deal as well as a treatment with ""respect"" much better than the one i got from Plano dealership , and btw; I made my purchase from there on the same day.

I would not recommend Plano dealership to anybody because of the horrible sales experience that I got and again I will make every single effort to share my horrible experience with those people. ",1.0

2461,"May 16, 2016","I would like to give a brief introduction here about the customer service that was offered by Mr. Anwar Achankunju. Mr. Anwar is a  reliable sales person who wishes to do his best for making the car buying process smoothly and efficiently for a customer at Toyoto of Plano. The best thing that I noticed on him that he does not exhibit the nasty side of the sales tactics that many of the sales people do in the industry. He  explains everything in details and makes follow up once the sales process is over. So I can assure that Mr. Anwar is a true sales professional who     keeps an ethics in sales  and shows a commitment to the customer as like his commitment with the dealer.

Zero pressure - he seemed genuinely focused on helping me make the best choice for my needs, vs. his commission check, and I appreciated that so much.  Mark the finance manager got me through the paperwork quickly and easily, and start to finish, this could not have been easier.

2488,"April 30, 2016","Originally bought my 2014 Tundra from Mustafa Al-Far in December 2013. Had the truck since then and loved it. A few weeks ago April 11,2016 to be exact we had a really bad hail storm in Wylie, My family and I were caught in baseball sized hail and 70+ mile an hour wind. The truck took a beating but held up kept us safe. Surprisingly no hail made it through any windows especially considering the hundreds of local houses with baseball sized holes in their roof.

Fast forward two weeks and $8k damage appraisal later there are no local repair facilities accepting any vehicles due to demand. There are no regional shops with an available spot until Mid-Summer.  There are no rental cars available. A national chain who I won't mention by name offers to get my vehicle fixed in Okalahoma City some 3 hours away. No Thanks! After the way my truck held up to such large hail I won't consider anything other than another Tundra.  So I stop by Toyota of Plano during my lunch break to weigh my options. I seek out Mustafa specifically because he's a really good guy and I was impressed during the first sale. Luckily he's there on his day off working. 

I see a new 2016 Black Tundra with the TSS package that catches my eye but I'm not sure if I want to make the move just yet.  Meanwhile my 2014 is being assessed for it's trade in value.  All of this takes place over the span of about an 45 min period before returning to work.

Later I return and Mustafa has the Tundra ready for the test drive. Long story short, I leave with a new 2016 Tundra, spray in bed-liner arranged and smiling even more than the first time in 2013. Keep in mind this entire process was started over an 1.5hr lunch break. I returned after 5pm and was home by 8 pm with a new Tundra!

2501,"April 25, 2016","I knew I wanted a newer car for some months now. I'd been comparing and looking online for weeks...Id even visted another Toyota dealership in Dallas just a few days prior. That experience was horrible. The guy had it in his mind that I wouldn't qualify for this or that...so much so that he didn't even bring out the keys of the vehicle to show me the inside of the car. He completely made me angry, so I didn't go back to that dealership at all. Toyota of Plano was beyond the exact opposite of that other place. I instantly felt like I was the only person buying a car on a Saturday in Plano. I was greeted...the car was already brought around front ready and waiting on me. I sat in it, adjusted the Bluetooth, went on a test drive. I don't have an 850 credit score...if I'm being honest, it's not even 850 adjacent...they aren't neighbors. The staff in finances worked hard to see what my options were. They got me a good deal, something I could afford, and I left later that day in a brand new 2016 Camry that only had 14 miles on it. I've never owned (or even driven) a car that was that new! The other place almost turned me off this brand, but Roberto and Toyota of Plano have made everything right again and won me back. Good thing too, because I adore my new car!! 

PS...I really liked when I got home and posted about the experience on facebook for my friends and family, I got a reply, shout out from Toyota of Planos Facebook page. The entire experience I felt like I was valued...the most important consumer in the world. Don't leave Plano and go to Dallas to find a great delearship. In fact, tell all your Dallas friends that they just make a small commute north to Preston & George Bush. That's the intersection for the best Toyota dealership in all of north Texas. Thanks again to you guys. I'll come back again when I decide to get another new Camry.

2526,"April 13, 2016","I was ready to buy a compact SUV and I was choosing between a Honda CRV and a Toyota Rav4. My plan was to test drive the CRV on a Monday and the Rav4 on a Tuesday, then to do the ""dealing"" the following Saturday. We had purchased a 2015 Toyota Camry from Toyota of Plano the previous year for my wife, and we were very pleased with both the car and the dealership. I did like the CRV very much, but I liked the Rav4 even better, probably because of the familiarity with it from driving the Camry and because it looks more sporty. I worked with Noe Perez and found him very professional and likable. The test drive experience was interesting due to no fault of the dealership. A few days before, there had been one of Texas's notorious hail storms and the dealership received baseball sized hail causing pretty significant damage to the bulk of their inventory, I really felt sorry for them. This made it challenging to find a model I was interested in to drive. Noe was very professional about it and we found one to drive and another one to look at that had the color and the interior that I was interested in. Due to their damaged inventory, they were receiving regular shipments of new inventory and it looked like the one I wanted would be coming the next week. I told Noe if they could get it there by Saturday, it would be great. He called me Friday night telling me that it had arrived. We went in Saturday and they spent a lot of time going over the details of the car with both my wife and me. The paperwork was fairly painless and we were in and out in less than 2 hours.

Other dealerships have tried to sweet talk me because I am a woman (I'm sorry, but I've lived in Texas for 30 yrs), however Carlos was a complete gentleman and I have told many people already if they need a Used car go to Toyota Plano and speak with Carlos. Then it was time to wait to speak with the gentleman in finance, and I was worried. They are generally the slimy people - those who have bought a car understand!

Before I arrived to the dealership, I was bracing myself for days of visiting dealership after dealership hunting for my new car, but thanks to Toyota of Plano, I found my ideal car (and financing deal) in just an hour.

2537,"April 07, 2016","Life long Toyota owner. Was GM truck guy to start. I've purchased 12 trucks and vehicles through Toyota for myself and my businesses. This current Tacoma could out perform any 2500 Pickup on the planet and I proved it over and over until it hit 240,000 miles and started a tiny one drip every three days from the transfer case. No big deal. Easy fix its a Tacoma I could fix it with a jack and a pair of pliers but it is a '99. I haven't purchased a new vehicle since technology took over so I was worried but needed a second vehicle to feel safe and stay working. I went to Toyota of Plano, to used cars and met up with Carl Teachout. I wanted another Toyota but we couldn't find one, This was just after a huge Hail storm. I wasn't even thinking bout that I wanted a second truck for security. So Carl was honest about the inventory being damaged and we happened across an alternative. A GMC , Hmm maybe. So we worked out some numbers, pretty quick, and I stalled to get advise about the deal. I left and about an hour later I called Carl and asked if the advise given could be looked into. He listened, followed through and sure as shi_ called back and said its yours. You can't get sales people to listen to you let alone act on your advise most places but Carl did and now I've got a second truck, no stress and a pretty good deal. I love Toyota but this is not a bias review. Its truth. Mark Miller was awesome with the finance, Carl Teachout has a bright future in auto sales should he decide to pursue it even short term.

2541,"April 04, 2016","Made an appointment with Ali and was in contact with him over the week before my new car purchase (2016 Scion iA). Met up with Ali, and then Curt took over after lunch. Curt was great - super nice and helpful, very polite. During the price negotiation, Cisco - a manager - came out. I understand he's there to be the strong arm in the negotiation, and to drive a hard bargain, but within 30 seconds of sitting down to talk with me, he had his cell phone out and was texting. I mean, we were in the middle of a conversation, he had just introduced himself, and then just stopped mid-sentence to text someone else for at least a full minute. It was incredibly rude - I definitely don't do it as a customer of a business, and to have an employee of a business do it while working is unacceptable. We walked out. Curt apologized repeatedly, although Cisco never did. Eventually, Curt came down to a price we liked, and we had a new car. I would have given 5 stars, based on Ali and Curt alone, but Cisco gets a negative 2. Overall, a good car-buying experience, minus Cisco.  ",4.3

We appreciated the offer and took his card with a saleswoman Sama  on it. upon arrival she was busy with other customers and Joey was attempting to contact her for us and we felt comfortable with him and asked him to help us.

I thought that I wanted a small SUV, having only had small vehicles (Tercel--you can tell my age somewhat from that--and Corollas).  I was sent to see Ken Steele, and I felt that for once, a car salesman really listened to me--my wants, needs, limitations, etc.  Ken wasn't pushy at all. He made a suggestion, and I loved it.  I really hadn't planned on getting anything until May at the earliest, but after considering the deal offered and getting exactly the features I wanted, I drove the 2015 Camry home that night--late that night.  The dealership closes at 9.  Ken and his colleagues remained there and walked me through the process and catered to my needs until almost 11 p.m.  Also, I didn't know that I don't have to bother about taking off work to get my new tags.  They make it really easy at Toyota, and I am really enjoying my car.  Certified/Pre-Owned is definitely the way to go!    ",5.0

2616,"February 27, 2016","My Experience
I initially emailed Mr. Ken Steele inquiring about a Toyota Camry 2015 SE and scheduled an appointment, but I wasn't able to make it to the appointment. When I walked into the store sometime later in the day, Mr. Steele was occupied, and Mr. Dennis Woodard stepped in and helped my fiancee and I. I had an idea on what type of car I wanted (model, year, mileage, trim, etc) so we took couple of test drives on couple of the cars I was interested in. While it took a little while to find the car that I thought was fairly valued, we eventually found ""the"" car after several hours. The whole process was tiring and protracted, but Toyota of Plano made it more manageable.

I would recommend Mr. Steele, for his knowledge and commanding presence that sped up the finding/buying process even though he wasn't as involved as Mr. Woodard. Nonetheless, I appreciated his candor, straight-to-the-point mentality when it comes to selling cars.

I highly recommend Mr. Woodard in particular. Mr. Woodard effectively communicated, demonstrated professionalism, enlightened us with knowledge that EMPOWERS the customers so that they can receive a fair deal. Many car salesmen these days are dishonest, vague, and lack professionalism, but for Mr. Woodard, however, he acted as a dedicated car salesman, who simply wants to ""put food on his table"" for his family, while maintaining his integrity by providing a fair price and relevant information to the customers.

Thank you Toyota of Plano for a wonderful experience. ",4.8

It only took a couple of hours to walk out the door with the keys to my new truck! I am a first time buyer, so this was an exceptional job well done with Monica! I could not be happier with my purchase! I traded in my 2007 Jeep Liberty and they did their best to give me the max value for my trade-in, so again, exceptional customer service.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
I had come to the Toyota of Plano dealership recently with my son-in-law Bijal Modi to purchase a new car.  
Kash Zaman was the Sales Professional who helped us.  He did a wonderful job of helping us with the purchase.  
Kash is a friendly young salesman, who went out of his way to make sure that our questions were answered.  My son-in-law did purchase a 2016 Toyota Highlander as a result of the test drive and the visit.  
The experience continued with Kash's help in promptly installing today (2/12/2016) the new license plates for the car, when they arrived, and providing us with a courtesy car wash!
As a result of the excellent help provided by Kash, I will definitely want to consider purchasing a new Toyota from ""Toyota of Plano"" if I am in the market for a new Toyota vehicle.
In addition, I am happy to recommend Toyota of Plano, as well as Kash, to friends and associates who might be in the market for a new Toyota vehicle purchase.
Thank you, Kash, and thank you, Toyota of Plano!

I initially found a used car listed on their site for ~1.5k over the going price for the region.  I gave them a call, and it wasn't an hour before I had negotiated them down to terms I was more comfortable with.  I had a relative check the car out and secure a down payment, since I was coming to pick this car up from out of town, and I didn't want any surprises (such as Courtesy Nissan selling a car out from under me when I was 2 hours into a 4 hour drive to pick it up).  The better part of a week goes by and I'm finally on my way to pick it up.  At the dealership we were swiftly greeted, and Ken was ready to address our purchase right away.  We get our financing in order, check the car out one last time, and drive off.  No arduous sales pitch, save the warranty sell from the financing individual.

I would say overall this was a positive experience.  At no point was I cornered and coerced into some deal or another.  I knew what I wanted, and the dealership and salespeople worked to make it happen.  I was left feeling positive, and will recommend them for anyone in the new/used car market.

2752,"January 02, 2016","I used TrueCar.com and purchased a used vehicle at Toyota of Plano and my sales person was Jacoub Oueini.
The vehicle is a gem and the price was better than any other dealers offered.
What I think was a big part of such a great experience however was having  Jacoub as my sales person.  He has great attention to detail and was a pleasure to deal with.  He recommended I put some money down to hold the car and I am glad I did.
When I arrived for my appointment we took the car for a test drive.  We then proceeded to finish the paperwork at exactly the promised price.
Jacoub explained everything about the paper work and had the car re-detailed while we did the paper work.  Even as I was driving away Jacoub noticed I was slow to get my phone synced to the audio system, so he jumped back in the car and helped with that and as a finishing touch he noticed I needed instruction on the shifting gear that has an manual shift option I did not know about.
Good job Jacob and Toyota of Plano!

After we did a test drive--we were in love with it.  We truly thought it would take all day to find what we were looking for.  Jose helped us measure our baby car seats to make sure we had spacious room.  That way when we installed them at home--there wasn't any concern if they would fit in this car.
He pointed out every feature that he could to help us.   There was NEVER any pressure from him.  Jose was the kindest gentleman.

Who wants to go through the hassle of dealing with a car salesman? Kind of like a colonoscopy without anesthesia. I did look on line to see the ratings of Toyota dealers in the Dallas area and found Plano at the top with Cowboy in Dallas.  I was going to buy a new 2016 Camry, however, I found a Toyota Certified 2012 Camry in immaculate condition for several thousand dollars less than market value( and WAY less than new) and decide to go look at it. Pulled into the dealer's lot and Carlos Lazo met me when I arrived as he was already outside. He was professional and friendly and I told him the car I wanted to see. They had it up front and center as one of their ""showcase"" cars to get everyone's attention. We went inside to look up the details and get the keys. No push, no aggressive ""you need to buy this car today"" crap. I told him this car was for my wife and I would have to bring her back after her work for her to see. At that point he volunteered to let me take the car to Frisco and show it to her. I thought that was a great plan and great customer service and off I go after a few paperwork details. They gave me 3 1/2 hours to complete the assignment. I drove, she saw, she liked, I liked, the price was awesome and I returned to the dealership and said sold. This was painless. By the way, they put new Yokohama tires on the car.  I wrote a check for full payment. He was happy. I was happy. My wife was happy. I said to Carlos Merry Christmas! COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE HASSLE FREE. Even when I returned with my wife this afternoon to sign all the paperwork everything was ready and BAM! In no time all was completed and we were on our way.

The staff at Toyota of Plano was very patient and accommodating, especially my sales rep Forkan.  I have purchased many vehicles, and Forkan was by far the best sales person I've ever done business with.  The sales manager Shane was great as well. Shane and Forkan took the time to understand my situation, needs, and wants with no pressure unlike other dealers I shopped.  I visted the dealer several times before making a decision and purchase.

2882,"November 09, 2015","I can't stress how much I appreciate the friendliness and professionalism at Toyota of Plano. Every one from front office to financing has been very kind, attentive, informative and professional. In addition to buying my second camry at this location, I have taken my first camry here for service and the process has been smooth and I always feel taken care of.

My family and I have driven Nissan's for as long as I can remember, and I have to say that the customer service and pushy sales people at Nissan dealerships completely killed our experience with the brand. I walked into a Nissan in the DFW area because they were promoting certain incentives online, I walked into their dealership thinking I would get a great deal and they ended up giving me the excuse that they didn't have the model promoted on their website and were pressuring me into buying into an older model with ridiculous financing. At one point the sales man and his manager had several sales people coming by his desk to convince me to take the ""incredible deal"" they were offering. I have never felt so uncomfortable! Visiting Toyota of Plano has been an absolute pleasure. The first time I visited, I test drove my car the staff was incredibly friendly and allowed me to test drive several cars that matched my needs. I even went home and took my time to think about it (it's a big purchase!). There was zero pressure and the sales person was there to help me with additional questions over the phone. 

Thanks to Kal and Justin for making my second purchase here so smooth and enjoyable! I highly recommend buying your vehicle at this location, they have amazing customer service. 
I love my camry!

He made it so easy - he is kind, considerate, listens well, knows his products, never once pressed, and gave great, honest advice.  I also had the pleasure of meeting Bill, who helped the numbers work in my favor.  And finally, closed the deal with Sam Karr, who was equally pleasant and helpful.

Then Travis showed and explained to us all other things that needed attention for safe operation of the vehicle. He kept us apprised of the progress on the car. Again, he took the time to explain to us item by item pricing at the checkout counter. We were really impressed by Travis, his professionalism and this dealership. Toyota should be proud of Travis.

2900,"October 30, 2015","Our recent purchase of a Toyota Highlander could not have gone smoother.  We were never pressured to buy, and never had to deal with any sales pitch garbage from Mr Wade Lee or any of the Toyota of Plano associates.  Wade went out of his way to find exactly what we were looking for, and to thoroughly answer every question we had. And while doing all he could to track down everything we hoped for in the vehicle, he also helped us to understand when some of our 'wishlist' options simply would not be a possibility within the timeframe we needed to make the purchase.  If he didn't know something completely, then he took the time to find out rather than make up something. Wade's outstanding service also didn't stop when the sale was complete. He took the time to set us up with our first service appointment so that we don't even have to think about it when the time comes six months from now.  And before we left the lot in our new vehicle, he took extra time (even though this was well past closing time) to have the vehicle washed, detailed, and filled with gas, and then went on to demo and explain many of the features and operations of the vehicle controls and displays to make sure we were comfortable enough with everything to started. We could not be happier with Wade's customer service and attention to detail.  When it came to financing the purchase, Mr Mirza Begovic was very thorough in explaining all aspects of the financing process, and when offering extended warranty advice, he did not try to upsell us on any thing that was more than necessary.  Even though we already had been pre-approved by our own bank for financing, Toyota actually offered a better route to finance our purchase.

To top it off there was no cruise control on this car lol. Needless to say we went in and spoke to Scott. He asked us what we wanted and he did just that got us what we asked for (with the exception of tented windows) at the price we wanted.

We decided that maybe it was an opportunity to upgrade to an SUV and went back to Toyota of Plano at 38 weeks where we first got Fred. Roberto took care of us as soon as we walked in the door showing us the new impressive features on a Highlander Platinum model and the RAV4 Limited. Elvis shadowed Roberto and took care of the hospitality and was our extra passenger in the test drives. This was perfect considering how we sometimes have family visiting. Although we loved the Highlander, I felt it was too big and impractical for me at this time. The RAV4 Limited was just the perfect size and waiting for the right color to be delivered was somewhat nerve-wrecking since we didn't know when the baby would arrive [the silver one we wanted was sold before the deal was done =(],  Understanding our situation, Roberto was able to deliver the new car earlier than expected, reviewed the features, and helped us connect our phones to the bluetooth. When we finalized the paperwork with Mirza, he was very personable, engaging, and helped us choose the right plan for us.

We arrived and Jay met us at the front of the store and took us immediately to the vehicle we were interested in. He performed a great presentation of the car and took us on a test drive explaining all of the features that the car possessed.  We returned to the dealership and sat down to discuss the purchase.  Jay knew how we wanted to proceed and he made it happen.  He arranged an extremely fair price for our trade in and it wasn't long we were off to finance to meet with John Fulgoni to complete the paperwork.  John was great.  After a brief time there we were done and returned to Jay and he put us in a beautiful new Toyota Avalon.  He helped us link our phones and set up the radio and we were soon on our way.  

I can't say enough good things about the entire encounter.  Great people, great customer service.  Best Auto purchase I've ever made.  I highly recommend for anyone in the market for a vehicle.",5.0

2962,"October 04, 2015","Not sure if their technicians are under trained or if they make an effort to rip people off. Regardless this is my second experience with Toyota of Plano where I have been overcharged and prescribed parts I don't need! This time I got wise and contacted another dealer:

Took my vehicle in for 125,000 oil change and inspection. I was informed my water pump was leaking and that it was ""priority #1."" Quoted $865 for the part and instillation. This was odd to me for two reasons. The first I had just had to water pump replaced during my 120,000 mile service (the tech and service manager could have easily seen this as all maintenance has been done at a Toyota dealership since the vehicle was purchased). Second the price quoted was inflated $150 from when the repair was performed 4 months ago. After contacting additional Toyota dealers, I was quoted $750 (15% cheaper). When I arrived to have the vehicle inspected at a different dealer, I learned that my water pump was in great condition (because it was new) and that I only needed to have an $80 hose replaced. I will never use your establishment again and would advise others to take their business elsewhere!

This most recent time I wanted a particular vehicle in a certain color within a specific price range and he went out of his way to find it.  We had a couple of false starts but he just kept at it until he found the car.  Everyone else at the dealership ( particularily Shawn Esfahani ) pitched in to make it work but Mus was the man who kept it all moving.  Aside from his professionalism he is just a nice man.  I never felt any pressure and always felt he was in my corner. I feel he is an asset to the dealership and I recommend him highly. ,5.0

Aggravated I had to move on and out. Toyota's reputation, again finding the desired van on Toyota/ Plano's website and the dealership being near my home prompted me to return the next day for a rerun with a fresh face . That's when Sal Rodriquez saved the day. He reeled me in with superior people skills, genuine congeniality, personal guidance and good knowledge of the Toyota product. As expected, he called in quality people, Shane House and Sam Karr, to address the fine points for closure of the deal.

3084,"August 16, 2015","When I started my car search, I wasn't intending on getting Toyota and I visited a lot of different dealerships and interacted with a lot of car salesman during the process. However, my experience with Faz Imam and Anwar Achankunju was so exceptional that I was sold on a Toyota. Faz came across as extremely transparent and I was very comfortable with him from the start. He was extremely calm, is a great listener and gave his honest feedback. Anwar is very knowledgeable on the cars he is selling. I visited various dealerships where the salesman didn't know/remember the different options for the various trims in many cases made mistakes (I know because it didn't match the information I found on the internet) whereas I was surprised how Anwar was so intimate with the different the options and trims. Anwar doesn't try to oversell you stuff and after listening to your requirements tells you what he thinks will give you the biggest bang for the buck. Anwar gave me such a good deal off the bat that I didn't even need to negotiate. Out of curiosity, I called a different Toyota dealership as they had the color I was looking for and after the other dealership heard the deal that Anwar had given me, the salesman was speechless and said that I had done well. The irony is that I didn't even negotiate with Anwar. Both Anwar and Faz did not employ any pressure tactic that unfortunately has become synonymous with today's car salesman and they are both very patient throughout the process. What took me by surprise is that even after I purchased the car, Anwar took his time to show me ALL the features of the car and shared his best practices. I truly had a fantastic experience with both Anwar and Faz and it was completely stress free. If you're in the market for a Toyota you definitely need to talk to Anwar and Faz. Even if you've decided to buy a different brand, give Anwar and Faz a chance and see what they can offer. ",5.0

3129,"August 02, 2015","My wife and I embarked upon our first car purchase in 15 years.  We had bought our first Toyota Corolla a few years ago, about a year old, with 26,000 miles.  Because her experience with this car has been very good, we were lead to look for a Camry over an Altima or a Fusion.  While looking for the Camry in a slightly used model, some certified used Camrys, we came across a vehicle that Scott O'Neal had at Toyota of Plano.  

The Camry seemed more affordable than most other new cars we'd looked at, with some good dealer discounts as well.  Scott clarified the discounts available when I asked about the vehicle, causing me to lean towards the 0% financing with an additional $500 off.  Knowing how we might finance a new car was one pretty big step in the process.  I had included T,T,&L(but not dealer options) in my calculations and began to realize we might be able to afford the vehicle.

Scott called me to clarify the unknown element of Dealer Options, which meant Lo Jack and pinstriping.  The cost of these features was a hurdle, but later thought of as a helpful feature, especially the security of the Lo Jack.  The dealer worked with me some on my trade-in, allowing us to get closer to our budget.

Scott stuck with us during the afternoon.  The time was dragging a bit and we were starving.  Scott dipped into his stash of snack bars giving one to my wife and one to me as well.  We got to the dealer at about 2:40 and left with a new car, my old car tags, a variety of special coverages for our purchase, 0% financing on our Camry, making it to our dinner destination by 6:40.  A big thank you to Scott and his team of helpers at Toyota of Plano, including Sally Murray, Fazil Imam, Crystal for the chat session, and Mark in financing.  Super job by a super crew.

I had the great pleasure of working with Jorge Ruelas. He was very professional and very helpful. Jorge wanted to make sure we were absolutely confident in the car we were choosing...he even walked the parking lot with us opening several cars so we could look and sit in them. On one occasion, he came in after his day had ended and waited an hour over our expected time of arrival ( due to a car accident on the NDT) just so I could make sure I was picking the right car. The whole time being very pleasant and positive assuring us he just wanted us to be happy and confident with our choice.
I would definitely recommend Toyota of Plano and I most certainly would send friends and family to Jorge.

I went to see John as I wanted to make sure I was getting the most current information on the features available on the car.  I made my list, including some features many people don't get (i.e. all-wheel drive) and excluding some that many people do get  (i.e. DVD player).  John entered the order and gave me a print to review.  After a few minor updates, John set out to ""find"" the car on the lot at the factory in KY.  The car arrived in Plano and was ready for delivery about a month after the order went in.  John made sure the car was readied with a few dealer-installed updates and took the time to brief me on the car for turnover.

He is neither pushy nor will sell you something that you have not asked for. He gave me a detailed analysis of different options and their price. We came back to his office and then I left with a promise that I will be back a day later with my wife. My appointment was set for 4pm. 
Me and my wife met him on the scheduled time and day. He was ready for us. I told him to educate my wife about the new Highlander and its features. He fully explained the options and their working once again. We test drove the vehicle. After that we spent about 10 minutes on negotiating the final amount. They gave me a very good trade in value on my previous Highlander and a great price for their new Highlander (Limited). We spent about 20 minutes in the finance department to signed the documents and came back to Moe The. He was ready for us. He personally filled the gasoline in our car and had it ready. He had the toll tag  and license plates from my old vehicle ready in an envelope on the table for me. Then he took us to our new Highlander and like a quick installation guide explained how to use the options. Once we were fully satisfied, only then he let us drove out of his lot.

3214,"July 01, 2015","We spoke to Sal Rodriguez prior to arrival.  He provided clear and effective communication.   He was prompt and helpful in providing real-time stock information.  Upon arrival he greeted us personally and apologized for being tied up with another customer.  He even took a few moments to introduce us to Jorge and explain our previous discussions.  He was cheerful and enthusiastic throughout this process.

Jorge Ruelas was a great salesperson to work with.   He was personable and knowledgeable.  From start to finish his goal was obviously to make the purchase process as easy and comfortable as possible.

He quickly helped us locate a vehicle meeting all of our requirements and remained cheerful and enthusiastic as we reviewed several vehicles before choosing one.   Once we had decided on a vehicle it was approaching time for the dealer to close.  Jorge remained dedicated to facilitating our purchase as the evening progressed.  The application process was easy and transparent.  There were no surprises or complications to the purchase transaction.  

Throughout the evening Sal would check in and offer assistance and went out of his way to praise and support Jorge.  We really felt like the most important people in the dealership.

The closing paperwork was straightforward and efficient.  Again information was clearly presented in a non-rushed or pressured way.  And by this time it was nearly an hour after close.

My wife and I cannot express how different dealing with Toyota of Plano is from our previous experiences.   We will be recommending them to friends and family.

So I went looking one Sat and ended up at this dealership. Now, I had certain SUVs in mind that I wanted to take a look at but they didn't really have ""the one"" in the SUVs I thought I was wanting. That's when JR showed me this beautiful Acura MDX. I hadn't even thought about that as an option because they've always been out of my price range and I thought, maybe a bit fancy for trucking my dogs around. But he convinced me to take it for a spin, as well as take a good look at it, and I fell in love. AND it was in our price range! 
So we put a deposit down and I came back with my husband the following Tue. And JR and my hubby worked out an awesome deal so that I could have this amazing and beautiful car.

JR was great and so informative about everything in our area. He saw that I was having a hard time with the move and I was worn out from it as well. But he really made me feel like moving to TX wasn't the end of the world. He even shared a recipe with me that I'm excited to try, as well as some of his families favorite places to go visit. JR made the experience less about buying a car, which, let's face it, can be less than delightful most of the time, and more about getting me in the vehicle that was right for me, exceeded my expectations, and that I truly needed asap. 

My husband will be needing a new truck here soon and I know who we will be going to for that!

Definitely you will be my priority before I buy another car/vann or any other type of vehicle.

My husband and I were looking for a used car for our daughter.  We periodically looked on line and just decided one day we would just drive around to use car dealers.  We spent an entire day going from place to place with no success.  Upon our return home, I went back to the internet and saw a vehicle at Toyota of Plano.  I completed the form to see if the car was still available and received a fairly quick response wanting to confirm my contact information.  The next morning we decided to take a ride to the Toyota of Plano dealership.  The moment we walked in the door we were kindly greeted.  We told them what were interested in and we were referred to Brian.  We discussed the vehicle with Brian and we took our test drive.  We inspected the vehicle, asked some questions and decided we wanted to purchase it.  Throughout the process, we felt very comfortable with Brian and he portrayed a very courteous, honest and professional attitude; if he didn’t have an answer to our question, he found it right away.  Purchasing a vehicle to me is normally very stressful. But this experience was just the opposite, there was no pressure.  I would definitely refer anyone to Brian at Toyota of Plano. He is a true professional. I would buy another car from Toyota of Plano.

It seemed like the battery was dying (clicking sounds), but would still start part of the time.  I had it towed using Toyota Roadside assistance to Toyota of Plano.  The service advisor was genuinely disinterested in providing any level of customer service.  They said they tested everything and everything was fine.  At one point the advisor said ‘I’m spit balling here, but…’  Spit balling isn’t a phrase you want to hear about a brand new car.  He said I shouldn’t have that issue again and it was probably just a fluke with a new car.

After I left Toyota of Plano I stopped for gas on the way home and had the same issue.  I called the Toyota Cares corporate number to complain.  The Director of Ops from Toyota of Plano called shortly after and provided no useful information and accepted no responsibility.  I took the car to Toyota of Grapevine and they said they didn’t know why Toyota of Plano didn’t replace the battery.  The service advisor there was wonderful.  They replaced the battery and I haven’t had any issues for the past 2 weeks.

Moral of the story – use Toyota of Grapevine, not Toyota of Plano.  Toyota of Plano is moving to be closer to the new Toyota headquarters; they better get their act together.  This level of quality won’t cut it with corporate executives. There should not be such a drastic difference between the quality of one dealership and another.

First, I was able to get a lot of my questions answered over email/phone/text. I had a good idea walking into the dealership what to expect on the vehicle as well as on the pricing.

Second, Kal, who handled my Sale was unlike any other I have encountered in all of my previous car buying experiences. Buying a car for me has mostly been a painful experience. Kal however made me comfortable right from our first interaction. At no point did he try to push anything on me. Rather, he asked me intelligent questions, made prudent suggestions and answered all my questions  in the most friendly yet professional manner. Kal, you are a gem.

Finally, I have to put in a word for Mirza who handled the financial aspects of the sale. I don't think I was with him more than 10 minutes. He handled everything so efficiently. My previous experience of car buying had taken an irritating 45 minutes and had left me shell shacked.

Toyota of Plano has changed my perception of Car Dealerships and Car Salesmen forever. I feel very comfortable in saying my family will stick with Toyota's from here on out, largely just because of my buying experience.

But after dealing with our first buying experience at Toyota of Plano, we decided to purchase again with them.  Francisco was not only personable and listened to my needs and wants in my new mini van purchase, he made time to go over all the ""specifics"" on my new purchase.  This saved me time and meant so much considering that he met me at the dealership on ""his day off.""  Talking about a commitment!!! I felt comfortable to ask questions and he was extremely knowledgable about the features of the Sienna.  My Sienna was ordered and Francisco kept my husband and I up to date on it's arrival to the dealership!   We all had an AMAZING experience at Toyota of Plano!!

Going into finance, Matt Hashem didn't have such an easy task.  Not due to his inability to complete the job, but his patience with us as we tried to satisfy a 2 year old and 3 month old.  Yes, talking about entertainment at its best.  Matt was patient and took the time to go over our financing often times having to stop to give us a minute to gather our kiddos.  He never made us feel like we were taking up his time and was completely understanding.  He took the time to explain each added protection feature and even tried to entertain our 2 year old as we signed agreements.  He knows the benefits of making a mommy very happy. It's not just about closing the deal, it's all about making your customer feel like you understand.  I truly thank you Matt!!

I was very surprised when I was greeted by Moe - very pleasant and professional gentleman.  He was efficient and kind - swift and very speedy in getting everything prepared - we did a quick test drive and then finalized the paperwork with finance and before I knew it, I was driving away with my new Toyota Rav in under an 1hr which was so awesome and no stress.

From the beginning Anwar and Freddy were really helpful and did everything they could to help ease the process. Anwar gave us the best deal upfront. He clearly explained any fees or extra charges. The price remained fixed during the financing process as well. Unlike our experiences with other dealerships, we did not feel pressured or that we were settling for less. We walked out paying less than we anticipated on a car loaded with features.

3338,"May 08, 2015","I purchased a 2012 IS 350 F.  Not a certified car.  Car is in very good shape and my dealings with Jorge Ruelas, the sales man, were excellent.  Although the sales man was not completely familiar with a non-Toyota used vehicle, he knew a lot and when he did not know something about the  car that could be researched (e.g., how to clean the unusual leather seat coverings) he would find out and get back with me via text, phone or email.  NOTE: Be aware that the option packages listed on the Toyota of Plano web site for non-Toyota automobiles are not completely accurate and you need to double check to make sure each option listed on the website is actually on the car.  For example, the web site advert for the car I purchased indicated that the option package included a compass built into the rear view mirror and memory for seat/side mirror positions for up to 3 different drivers, but these two options are not actually in the car.  There is a statement on the web page indicating that the description may not be perfectly accurate....so buyer beware.  Regardless, my experience with negotiating price, friendliness, honesty and good salesmanship with Jorge Ruelas was excellent and my overall experience with Toyota of Plano , Used Car Sales was about as good as it gets outside of an Lexus, Mercedes or BMW dealership.

Upon purchase and receipt of my car, it was very clean. Additionally, this dealership did not use Armour All type products all over the interior to cover up marks or flaws in the various plastic panels, dashboard areas, arm rests and/or glove box area.

The whole process was pleasant and painless and Mark bent over backwards to accommodate me.",5.0

I wasn't really thinking that I would buy from Toyota when I entered, especially since I was really drawn to a Kia Sorento I had just test driven. However, Kal struck me in short order as someone who would try to match us with the best fit for our needs and when it was all said and done, he provided us a better deal than what I was looking to get on the Sorento. Anyone looking for a new car should seriously consider making an appointment with Kal.

Jacoub Oueini was friendly from the moment I met him and he assured me that my interests in the Toyota Prius was his top priority.  Jacoub answered all my questions immediately and presented himself as very informed as to the specific mechanics of the Prius.  He showed me important features and gave me tips on how to maximize the performance of my Prius. 

Jacoub Oueini quickly learned my name as well as all the names of my children who were in attendance with me when I bought my Prius.  He learned what each one was interested in and engaged himself with each of them the entire time we were at Toyota of Plano.  

I knew what I wanted in a car and price and told Jacoub Oueini as soon as I came through the door.  He worked very hard to help me get what I wanted and make sure I was a satisfied customer.

After I bought my Prius, Jacoub Oueini called me to make sure I was satisfied with my choice and made sure the car was up to my expectations.  When I had a problem with the car and needed to use the jack, he made sure it was working and showed me how to use it.

Even though it took a month for me to make it back to the dealership after I purchased my Prius, Jacoub Oueini made sure I got my spare key.  He called to check on me and my satisfaction with the Prius on more than one occasion, which makes me feel like he really cares about whether I'm happy as his customer.  

I am so glad I came to Toyota of Plano to buy my latest car because if I hadn't, I wouldn't have met Jacoub Oueini.  He is truly a wonderful salesperson.  I'm very thankful for Jacoub Oueini.

So when it came time to look for a vehicle to replace our Odyssey (high maintenance, and lots of out of pocket repairs) we he knew exactly where to go.  Anwar discussed the Sienna and it's pricing with me.  He also found the color I needed and gave me an unmatchable price.  Additionally the appraiser gave me a value on my trade-in vehicle that I knew I couldn't get anywhere else.  One of the things that intrigued me the most about this dealership, was that they do not pressure you to make a sale.  If you have financial constraints, they will find a way to cater to your needs.  I never even thought or imagined that I would get warranty on my new vehicle, but they even gave me an amazing deal on the 5 year Platinum Coverage and made it affordable.  In the event that Anwar is occupied when I get to the dealership, they have an excellent showroom that has a waiting area that has an HD TV, as well as complimentary soft drinks, or coffee as needed.  I noticed that this dealership is one of the top dealerships in the country, but going there and experiencing the service they provided gave me an inside look at what is the reason they are excelling in all areas.

Matt (Finance) was also very nice and personable and I appreciated his help and patience explaining everything.  He also seemed sincere in finding what other warranty options would benefit me and not just trying to sell everything.

John, GM was personable and made a point to come by and say hello and chat.  He also was ready to pitch in and help keep the ball rolling when our salesman was tied up with something else towards the final papers.  I appreciated not having to sit and wait more as we were ready to finish off our days errands.

What I would like to change:  They were busy that day but I would still like to have gotten to the finance guy quicker.  I asked Dennis what rate my payment sheet was built on and he said he didn't know.  This rate was still not disclosed to me quickly by Matt and then I think only because I pressed for that info, it didn't seem to be offered.

He worked with me to find a deal that would work with my budget and what I was looking at for a car.  He was easy to work with and wasn't pushy in trying to get me to buy something right away.  I had to drop off my rental car and needed transportation back to the dealership and Erick provided transportation for me.  

Mark was easy to work with as well.  He explained everything and made it easy to understand.  He made the purchasing and finance part of the experience easy.  

My only issue I had was that I had to wait an hour before I could meet Mark to go over the finances.  It was 7PM on a Tuesday night and very few people in the dealership, so I'm not sure what took so long.  There wasn't anyone around to keep me posted on the wait time.  I tried asking the Receptionist what was taking so long or how much longer it would be and she gave me the response of ""I Don't know"" which is very irritating.  She looked very confused and lost and just stuttered some words to me and didn't provide any service at all.  I asked her again in about 15 minutes when she told me to come back and check and gave me the same confused response.  Not a good experience with your Receptionist.  They should know what is going on or at least provide a better response or get up and go find out what is taking so long.",4.0

a Limted, metallic grey. I needed an AWD, but there were none on the lot. Kash found one
at another dealer and agreed to transfer it. I agreed to buy it and worked with Matt Hashem
on the financing and extended warranties. I picked up the car the following day and Kash
spent at least an hour setting up the electronics, explaining the details along the way. As this was the first car I had purchased in 15 years, I appreciated the detailed explanation of the

I had any questions. I would rate him a solid 10!

We were coming to Plano Toyota from last 3 months and every time we visited we had our evaluation done for buying the same Limited Highlander  SUV but every time price and the payments went far away beyond what we could easily afford. Yesterday Evening around 4 Pm I went to Plano Toyota to get my SUV Serviced on 15000 Miles. Instead of waiting in the Waiting area as always I went into new Car section just to have mere look of my Dream Car Limited Highlander 2015 and ended up meeting with a graceful personality Mr Karl Mian. He greeted me in extremely courteous and friendly manner and immediately I knew Karl can roll the Dice and exactly the same happened. Since it was getting dark and I had to have my wife to have a look at the SUV,  I asked Kal Mian to do some miracle overnight  and if he could find what exactly was our need, he must call me . I was not sure that Kal could actually get us what no other dealership had offered earlier since we had obtained quotes from 6 or 7 other dealerships. 

Next day in the afternoon Kal called me and set appointment at 7 pm i.e today. He did everything he could to make sure we received everything that was important to us. He offered us what no other  dealership had  offered. Kal even beat the deal that I would have surely accepted if had not met Kal Mian last evening. Kal made whole process so easy and user friendly that in just 2 hours we came out driving our Dream Car "" 

                                      ""TOYOTA HIGHLANDER...LIMITED 2015""  

I would highly recommend working with Plano team. Buying a car can be a very stressful experience and Kal clearly explained everything to Us and  specially when it's extremely difficult to make my wife satisfied with the Product but because of Kal Mian's professionalism as well his conduct made us feel at home and without any stress.

We would strongly recommend Kal Mian for your next car purchase.

3579,"January 24, 2015","Writing a review is just not enough to explain how happy I am. I would fly a plane in the sky with a banner saying ""BUY FROM TOYOTA OF PLANO"" to get the word out. 

Overall Experience:
This was the BEST, HASSLE FREE, ""NO FUNNY BUSINESS"" experience in buying a car. This was my first car purchase and NEVER did I feel pressured into getting things I did not want or need. I had been trying to buy a car for about three weeks and was INCREDIBLY frustrated with being taking advantage of by other dealers (since I am young, naive - or so they thought) about the new car buying process. Toyota of  Plano NEVER tried to use my age or lack of knowledge about buying a car against me. 

Sales:
First, I was contacted within 5 minutes of filling out an online inquiry by Philip. Now, I can be very anxious person (as I was while on the phone), but Philip helped calm my nerves because he spoke very calmly, never interrupted me, and listened to me rant. Even with my frustration with other dealers, he never once spoke negatively about the other dealers which I found to be VERY professional. Toyota of Plano did not have the car on the lot, but told me they could get it in in 10 days. With my anxiety and lack of patience, I tried to run off to another dealer on poor Philip and when he called me, I legitimately think he was heartbroken. Philip did EVERYTHING he could to earn my business back. He  fought so hard I ended up canceling a credit card, so they other dealer couldn't run it,  just so I could buy from Toyota of Plano. Now of course you can't forget about Faz. Along with Philip, Faz stayed in touch with me as well. Listening to his voice on the phone was calming as well. (They are very good as de-escalation!) Faz was polite, and very prompt with communication. 

Financing:
I had come in with outside financing and was firm on not have my credit score run. Sam asked me for my credit score and was in disbelief that as many institutions that had run my credit, none of them had given me my credit score! He did convince me (but not in an overbearing way) and ended up being able to finance the car for lower than what I walked in with. . (They worked some SERIOUS magic). He explained the papers I was signing thoroughly, (though I still read them) and I walked out with financing IN HAND! 

Now - in one of my e-mails, I did ask Philip for a bow, because the car was a gift to myself. Philip frantically searched for a bow and Sam stalled with the financing to allow Philip time to look (I had no clue this was happening). Philip was unable to find the bow, but I GREATLY appreciate his effort. It was still magical!

Bottom line:
If you want great customer service that is not ""fishy"" or overbearing, and work with Salesman that are polite, patient, well groomed eye candy go to Toyota of Plano. :)

3582,"January 21, 2015","I purchased a car at the end of December 2014 and waited until now to do my review so I could calm down from being so angry. I purchased a used car from JR Sebastian for the second time. I absolutely love JR and will probably purchase another car from him in the future. That being said, I had a totally different experience with the Finance department this time around. I worked with Sam and I really felt like he was trying to pull one over on me because I am a woman. He glossed over some brochure regarding an extended warranty. Once he printed all of the paperwork for me to sign I discovered a $2400 charge for this warranty that I did not agree to purchase and when I questioned him about it he said, ""Oh, but I reduced the price of the car to cover it, ($500)."" I am no dummy and I can add and we went back and forth on this warranty for awhile. Ultimately ending with him telling me the only way to get financing for this older model car was to agree to the warranty. He did reduce the price of the warranty a little further but if I had it to do over again I would probably pay cash or come with my own financing in hand. The only reason I did not do that was because I had such a positive experience with the finance team the first time around.

In other words, they didn't listen to our needs/wants. 

At the Toyota dealership, we were greeted with a friendly hello and how can I assist you. Brian listened to what we wanted in a car, thought about our requests', made three suggestions and walked us to the cars. He was not pushy or cocky, but truly sincere in his desire to put us in a car WE wanted for our son. 

After a test-drive, we went inside to check on the price; Brian was able to come down slightly on the price and it was sold! Less than 20 minutes after we arrived, including the test drive, we had a reliable car for our son. 

We paid cash for the car. The Finance man ran quickly through the paperwork; he offered us the warranty and financing but didn't get too pushy when we declined. I must say the extended warranty you offered at a discount for students was a nice touch though. I appreciate you making the offer it's a great benefit to college students on a budget!

I will definitely recommend your dealership to my friends and direct them to Brian for a great car buying experience! Thanks!

I've been put through the ringer with past experiences with dealerships and sales personnel that were shady at best. Jacoub Oueini, Shane House and Sam Kaar were personable, professional, honest and pleasant to work with.  I wouldn't hesitate a single second before recommending Toyota of Plano, as well as Jacob, Shane and Sam, to anyone who is interested in purchasing a vehicle.  I applaud the dealership and the fine gentlemen I had the pleasure of working with.  Thank you for such a great car buying experience!

So I was very upfront with Kash that I do not want to waste my time. When I told him what I was looking for in a car, he was very efficient in helping me get the car I wanted and that's within my budget. He saved my time and he answared every question with patience.
I appreciate his work and I think he is very dedicated to his job.

We drove the first vehicle and this was the one!  I didn't even drive the other.  I was going to get financing through my credit union, but they weren't open that early (9:30AM Saturday), Mark asked what rate they gave me and said he could beat it.  And he did.

I was in and out of the dealership, driving my 2006 Toyota 4Runner in 1-1/2 hours!  I had to return the following Monday to get a few bulbs replaced, and once again, was greeted as soon as I walked in the door and helped by more than one person.

I explained that me and my wife were expecting and needed to trade in to a more up-to-date model that is both safer and easier to access for our soon to be new born. We offered inquiry for a RAV4. Moe took us to the lot and began showing us models based on our description of our wants/needs. He was very knowledgeable about the vehicles and offered great recommendations for potential vehicles, showing us several different trim types. One thing that impressed me is he asked why we wanted certain things, just to understand out needs, this was very important. We ended this visit by going home and discussing the potential buy. Upon leaving, we were met with ZERO pressure and just were told that if we needed anything to call or swing by and hoped to be seen later. This is a great quality in a dealership, they understood that the price of cars is expensive and decisions should not be made lightly. This reason alone i would recommend this dealership and Moe.

Additionally, Jorge is such a genuinely engaging and warm person he was truly a pleasure to work with. 

I want to also be certain to make mention of my interaction with Tony Yazbeck in Finance. Finance people are often, like sales may be, notoriously heavy handed. I was, though, pleasantly surprised to find Tony to also be calm as well as very open and responsive to all my lines of questioning (and I had quite a few!).

My experience with Mr. Moe Rezaei  was indeed Superb and well worth the travel. Always emphasizing a desire to help find what I was looking for, Moe's professional, straight forward, and courteous approach was refreshing after visiting so many other dealerships. 

Four months ago my previous family car of 8 years had been totaled. Despite the sudden need for a replacement and the expense of living with a rental, the challenge of finding the 'right car' and a trustworthy sales person seemed a daunting task. I procrastinated on the grounds of researching: Makes & Models, New vs. Used, Buying vs. Leasing, Pricing, Options & Features, Safety ratings, etc. Therefore, when I arrived at the Toyota of Plano dealership, I held pages of information and lists of questions. 

Remarkably, Moe's knowledge and patience warmed my 'cold feet'. For the first time in 4 months I felt completely comfortable with making a decision and driving home with my new car the same day.

My sincere thanks to Moe, without whom I would still be paying rental fees and losing sleep! My children even shook his hand and gave him a hug. We all learned a lot and are so excited with our ""Attitude Black"" 2015 Toyota Sienna L V6 7 Passenger Minivan. We are very appreciative of Moe and Toyota of Plano!

Erick was an awesome salesman who did not hassle me into the purchase and was kind enough to describe in detail how a lease works. We both agreed the lease option was best for me. He was patient and did not pressure me into anything; unlike most experiences. 

Financier Mark Miller was friendly and I was out of his office in less than 45 minutes.

What formed my opinion: poor communication, bad time management (inconsiderate of customers time), missed/failed commitments, no service recovery and overall poor customer focus. My sales person, although new, did a good job given his responsibility level. However the management team (in my opinion) are not focused on quality customer service and providing a positive customer buying experience. It seems they (management) do not have the skills nor the knowledge of how to create a positive buying atmosphere nor an understanding of how to provide a world class customer experience. I only purchased the car at because of my sales persons and the value of the car was okay. Had it not been for that, I would have certainly taken my business to another Toyota Dealership or back to a Subaru Dealership.

The pre-sale inspection was worth the $130, considering how much we would've spent on fixing the hidden repairs. We decided to go to Toyota of Plano for the convenient location (it was close to home) and for its well-established reputation. I remember the sigh of relief when we were kindly greeted by Alie at the parking lot. His no-pressure approach was WONDERFUL! He was very understanding and empathetic to our previous experience that day at Fares. And we were beyond impressed with his knowledge on the vehicles in the lot. My husband is a car enthusiast, and Alie passed every test question my husband threw at him. Alie was very professional, but also personal. We wanted a 4x4 within a certain price range. It came down to three choices... Tacoma, 4-Runner, and FJ. The FJ was the most expensive. It was very surprising that Alie encouraged us to pick the cheaper option (4-runner) because he wanted us to consider our growing family. He even encouraged us to ""sleep on it"" before we made any final decisions. That was the selling point for us- When he thought beyond the commission, and put the customer's needs first. Oddly, we went for the most expensive choice (FJ). Hubby fell in love during the test drive so we were past the point of no return.. LOL. But Alie worked his magic, and managed to get the price down to within our affordable range. Okay, now time for the downside... Finance was HELL! Long story short, we felt very pressured by Tony Yazbeck to finance through the dealer. We worked really hard to maintain great credit, and were offered an unbeatable rate by USAA. We also had $4500 cash to put down as a down-payment. Tony stated that they could not sell the car because my maiden name was under USAA and my driver's license is under my married name. I had several proofs to verify my identity to include passport, birth certificate, marriage license, and a military ID. Tony said he could not accept either one! He said the ONLY other option is if we financed through them or have my bank change my name (which would've taken longer and we needed the car ASAP for a trip). I spoke with USAA, who said that they had customers in my situation but never issues from the dealer if sufficient proof of identity was provided. They simply changed the name on the check to my married name, with a copy of my current license, passport, and SSN card. Mind you, this was 2 days already after the initial visit to Toyota. Tony had us dragging this for 2 days, 1 of which I had to miss work for! Tony's defense was that the state of Texas required it. The USAA rep I spoke with is in San Antonio, and had the same situation- with maiden name in bank check and married name on driver's license. She said all she had to do was provide her marriage license to the dealer to confirm her identity. It had nothing to do with the state of Texas requiring that the bank check has to be the same as the driver's license (even when supporting documents are provided). It was a lot of stress on myself and my husband. The inconvenience with finance was overwhelming. Again, it felt very strongly like they just wanted us to feel like we had no option but to finance through them. By the way, we got  4.24% rate with USAA vs their 7.9% rate. Common sense, we went with the best rate. And if it not had been for Alie following up on this mess, we were going to take our business to Subaru. Tony had no problem at all when I told him I was taking my business elsewhere because of their poor finance management. In fact, his words to me on the phone were, ""That's perfectly fine."" Thank goodness Alie intervened and saved the day! Another issue with finance, is that they refused to refund the downpayment back to us. USAA ended up covering a majority of the payment, which left a credit to us of $2000, since we overpaid when we gave the them the $4500 downpayment. Tony would not refund the $2000 that we overpaid, until the USAA check went through. It just doesn't make sense to me because they would've still had a $2500 downpayment as a security deposit from us. We eventually got our check in the mail... 2 weeks later. He originally told us it would be 4 days, and that we will be able to pick it up at the dealer. Another poor communication by finance. Bottom line, sales (Alie Shehadeh) was AWESOME... and finance, not so much. As for the car, we are enjoying are FJ and look forward to a taking it on our family outdoor excursions to Colorado and New Mexico! Note: All the ""excellent"" stars are towards my sales experience ONLY, not finance.",4.4

Once we both had picked out our cars, and he took us through each step of the credit app, we were sent on our way to Matt's office to do all the super fun paperwork.  Matt was also extremely patient, considering there was two of us/double the paperwork.

3793,"October 09, 2014","Ismail is what a car salesman should be!!  He was professional and personable.  He was thoroughly knowledgeable about his product and had worked at learning how each feature worked.  He found the car we wanted by LISTENING to what we said.  He was able to answer all our questions, usually from personal knowledge.  But if he needed information, he had the resources at his fingertips (literally -- in his phone) that gave us the answer to any question.  He gave us information and demonstrations without high pressure sales tactics.  He was honest throughout the deal.  We have never come away from a car deal feeling that comfortable and pleased.  Usually you feel exhausted and dread the next time you have to buy a car.  Others in the dealership were also professional and pleasant to deal with, willing to find answers and accommodate unusual situations (out-of-state buyer).  We hope others will try Toyota of Plano and receive the same top service that we did.  Thank you, Ismail and other members of the staff!

Ismail has a great attitude and really tries to make the deal happen.  He has excellent customer service skills, great personality and fun to work with.  He goes out of his way to show you what you think you are buying and offers suggestions to reach the customer's satisfaction. I also believe Ismail strives to get the deal to closing as efficiently as he can.
On my first visit to the dealership, I felt I was caught in the ""old school"" tactics (games) of ""if the potential customer is here at the dealership, then make them wait"".  Which should change in this day and age.  The customer should be in control not the dealership, IMHO!! We did not come to an agreement  to reach a sales closure on that visit.  I was not a ""happy camper"" upon departure from the dealership.
The following day I received a follow-up email from Ismail asking for feedback and asking if there was anything he could do so that we could make a purchase.  I responded and after several email exchanges I am ""Happy"" to say I am am a proud owner of a new Toyota.

3852,"September 07, 2014","I called Toyota of Plano to speak to an experienced Sales Person, that was my request when I called.  The gentleman that spoke to me, Ismail Choudhry was professional and extremely helpful!  Earlier that day I went to another dealership in Grapevine to see about getting a new Cadillac (used).  Much to my dismay I was treated as if I was a second rate citizen and that my business was not wanted.  I originally purchased my Cadillac from Darren the salesman that treated me this was.  The Manager also had the same attitude towards me.  I believe the cause of the treatment was due to my car having a car fax.  The accident occurred two years ago and I was rear-ended.  Was not my fault but you know life happens.  It's not like I chose to get rear-ended.  I left that dealership in tears and was very distraught.  I logged on to the internet and came across Toyota of Plano.  I spoke to Ismail and was a little defensive at first and asked him if he was going to treat me the same way because I had a car fax.  He assured me that would not be the case and that he would treat me like royalty. He also said he would do whatever it takes to make me a satisfied customer.  He was absolutely correct.  His Manager and the Finance Manager Matt was outstanding!  I cannot say enough about my overall experience.  I am a customer for LIFE!  I now have a new 2014 Camry that is just beautiful.",5.0

3856,"September 04, 2014","I wanted to buy a Lexus RX350 and was in a time crunch. I visited Toyota of Plano by chance as I had seen an ad for an older Lexus hybrid.. but unfortunately it was already sold by the time I got there. This is when I met Jacoub and when he offered to find me an RX350, I said, sure, call me if you find one and left.
This is a typical scenario at most dealerships and generally you never hear back from the sales person. But, Jacoub was different, the same day, he called me back in a few hours and he sounded very excited.. and he said ""I have something you will like, can you please come back and take a look at it"", he said, I am sure you will like it. I was in two minds as I was already pretty close to finalizing another vehicle at another dealership and was a bit skeptical. Since I was closing on another vehicle (not Lexus), I though maybe I should go and check it out.
So, I took my family over to Toyota of Plano and was very excited to see a vehicle that fit exactly what I wanted... I looked over and I saw a smiling Jacoub with that ""I told you so"" look :-). We decided immediately that this was the vehicle and in a few minutes, Jacoub was busy doing the paperwork.
I was equally impressed by Jacoubs manager and the whole experience was outstanding, from the financing to another round of checkup, their concern about the reputation and doing the right thing etc. They were very professional and friendly and accommodated every one of my needs. Clearly, an experience with car buying that I had never had before. We drove off in the car and the whole family was very happy with our purchase.
A couple of days later, Jacoub called me and said ""I have a surprise for you"", he said can you stop by the dealership..? I though this would be another one of those small little thank you nick-knack or something! but when I went over, he handed me a set of mats, the synthetic cover for the trunk and another spare key!! He had followed up with the previous owner and gotten another $600 worth of stuff that he did not have to do.
On top of all this, he gave a couple of names of nice restaurants in the area that we visited and absolutely love. We are new in the Plano area and having an experience like this was really amazing! I will certainly buy a car from him again!
Thank you Jacoub, really appreciate your help and your friendship! Wishing you all the best..",5.0

But Toyota of Plano completely changed my perspective. Even before I walked into the store I had someone checking on my needs and what cars I was interested in so when I actually did walk into the store the whole process was a breeze. I cannot rave enough about how amazing John Smith's service was. By the time I got there the car I was interested in had been sold and he managed to find an almost identical one right off the truck for me to test drive in an even better color. He took care me, answered all of my questions, he was open, honest and didn't use pushy sales tactics like most salesmen. When I purchased the car he sent me photo updates as it was being serviced and then combed through the car to make sure nothing had been missed. He made sure the car was sparkling before I drove it home and when my plates came in he installed them for me. Their finance guy Tony Yazbeck talked me (and my Dad on the phone) through everything as I was signing and gave me a great deal on warranty coverage.

He immediately looked up where the nearest one was at and found a brand new one heading to another dealership and called the driver to bring it to Plano. The driver refused to come all the way to Plano, so Ismail drove out to pick up my new car and bring it back to the dealership.

He said it would take 9-12 days to arrive and he got one to me within 24 hours. It was exactly what I wanted and he didn't pressure me into anything. He showed me what I could get, when I could get it, and everything else.

3924,"August 12, 2014","We called Toyota of Plano on a Saturday evening at 8 pm to see if we could take a look at a Highlander. Michael Collins told us we could come in and though it was too late for a test drive, he took the time to show us the Highlander and explained everything about the car to us in detail. We set up an appointment with him to test drive the car on Monday morning. 

Michael is very patient, professional and takes the time to show you everything you need to know about the car. It's very clear that he knows what he is talking about. You would never know that he is only been at this job for little over a year. He isn't pushy--very down-to-earth and honest. 

The Monday morning test drive went very smoothly, and Michael also made the extra effort to give me a trade-in value on my car (which was very reasonable). Mirza Begovic (Michael's manager) came to have a quick chat with me before I left and he was also very easy going and helpful. He told us that if we were interested in the Highlander we would have to give them some time to locate one since they are low on inventory (the Highlander is obviously very popular).  

That evening we decided to go back into the dealership to see if we could start the process for getting the Highlander. Michael worked with us from 5-9:30 and they managed to find a Highlander for us and we drove off with our new car that very night! They gave us an excellent price and a great trade-in price too! Excellent customer service!! So happy with the whole process. Probably one of the smoothest cay-buying processes I have ever experienced! Now I have a Highlander Limited with all the bells and whistles!

Highly recommend! If you are in the market for a Toyota, go to Toyota of Plano and ask for Michael Collins...you won't be disappointed!

3938,"August 07, 2014","I bought my first new car recently and decided on a toyota corolla 2014 from toyota of plano. After doing ample research and visiting several dealerships, I felt that the team at toyota of plano especially Kal Mian went above and beyond helping me find a new car and provide me with the facts I needed to make an informed and comfortable decision.

Buying a new car can be exciting for a first time buyer, but also a bit frustrating maybe even overwhelming having to deal with the many options, pricing, and most of all negotiating that is out there when searching for a vehicle. Toyota of Plano, specifically the salesman who helped me, Kal Mian, was instrumental in helping me pick out the right vehicle. He was patient, flexible with time, and very willing to listen to my concerns needs, and questions when looking for new vehicles. We must have tested a dozen cars on site and he was very patient throughout the process.  A patience that I honestly did not always find at other dealerships. Furthermore he was very straight forward in helping assess what my vehicle needs were. Originally I set out to buy a toyota prius, but after talking with Kal about my needs, budget, and test driving a variety of vehicles, I am glad that I went with the Corolla. I am incredibly happy and satisfied with my vehicle choice. Although the prius is a great car when it came down to it he was very helpful in figuring out the best car for me and not just the best car for a commission, which I really appreciate and went a long way in why I decided to do my business at Toyota of Plano rather than another dealership.Even though I had offers that were comparable and sometimes cheaper for the same vehicle, it was because of the great costumer service that they provided which made me feel confident I had made the right decision in my purchase.

Admittedly there were some hiccups here and there during price negotiating and later with some detailing issues on my car, but once again Kal was very patient and helpful in getting these matters addressed. As a new car owner I admittedly was a bit more meticulous about being satisfied with my purchase and thank Kal very much for helping provide exemplary service and dedication to satisfying a customers needs. I recommend anyone who is in the market for a new car to check out Toyota of Plano and speak with Kal.

We were introduced to Mustafa Al-Far (Moose), the sales representative. We set down with him and explained we were not sure exactly what we wanted. He asked the time frame for our purchase and we told him a few months. He explained the Camry's were changing designs and they would not be our for a few months.. He went on to say that Toyota was offering incentive's on the 2014's.  He showed us the Venza, similar to our Outback but it was a little more than we wanted to spend. We then test drove 2 Camry's, a Prius wagon and a Rav4. The Camry had the comfort and quiet ride we were looking for. Mustafa spent hours with us and never seemed rushed or in a hurry for us to make a decision. Since the Camry was the nicest of all the cars we had test driven, both here and at the other dealers, we decided to purchase one. We got a great deal and are very happy with our buying experience.

3968,"July 28, 2014",I brought in my Highlander to Toyota of Plano for an oil change.  During the change it was discovered that the oil plug treads had been stripped.  Rather than owning up to the issue as they had been the only ones to service the car in the last 50K miles they gave me dire warnings of having to pay hundreds of dollars for a new oil pan and my only hope was using a larger plug.  Sadly I let them cajole me into this quick and dirty fix to be rewarded with an oil leak that evening.  When we returned they once again tried to duck responsibility but we pushed back and they did something with our extended warranty to get it covered but my wife ended up in their waiting room for hours for the trouble.  This came on top of an issue where they did a controller replacement for a recall that was quickly followed by a mysterious engine shutdown.  Additionally the car had an ignition coil failure at 40K miles that they refused to cover under the certified warranty.  I couldn't trust the vehicle anymore so its being traded in.

This particular dealership was the best experience I have ever had. They were not pushy sales individuals, and were very respectful with our opinions, needs, and wants. Out of all the cars I bought this was my fourth Toyota. I was so amazed of the dealership’s personnel professionalism. They not only provided outstanding service during the purchasing process, but were amazing afterwards. We had seven different follow ups, communications from different people VIA, phone calls, and emails within a week of my purchase. That’s called SERVICE!

I’d really like to thank John Fulgoni, Visar Visoka, and Philip Hensarling for their outstanding service, knowledge, patience, and respect. I really appreciated their complete understanding of our needs, and guiding us through the buying process. It was truly a pleasure working with them.

With all my research from online and from the visit to the dealership, I found that Toyota of Plano had the best price and service in the area. I would recommend everyone I know who wants to purchase a car to go to TOYOTA of PLANO.

3977,"July 23, 2014","I went into Toyota of Plano with a set budget in mind. I met with John Fulgoni and Dennis Woodard and explained my situation, what I was looking for, how much I had to put down and how much I was willing to spend. We discussed the pros and cons of leasing vs. financing. And after some serious discussions we all agreed that leasing was the way to go. They crunched my numbers and after looking for a bit they found me a brand new 2014 Toyota Carolla that was just in my price range. I hadn't even seen the car when I was approved for it. The car had literally just come off the car hauler so it had no miles on it. It came in a beautiful color, looked sleek and stylish and had all the modern technology you could want in a car. Dennis walked me through on programming my voice to the cars bluetooth functions and discussed the features of the car with me in detail. I'm sure he's done this more times than he could count but he never once made me feel rushed or as if he was just going through the motions. I truly believe he cared that I cared about this purchase and about this car. He never made me feel anything but confident in my decision. Both Dennis and John took me through baby steps to be honest to make sure that I was 100% sure that this was a purchase I wanted to make. They left me with no doubts that I would be purchasing a safe, reliable vehicle for the right price point. They also made me feel safe discussing the warranty that comes with the car, along with the roadside assistance. It is always a good thing to know you won't be stranded if you need it. They both gave me their personal cell in case I had ANY questions about the car, which I found to be going WAY Above the call of duty. God knows I wouldn't want someone blowing my phone up for every little thing. But they cared enough to trust me with their personal numbers. That was something I'll never forget. It made me feel even more confident in purchasing this vehicle. Dennis made the car buying experience so easy and painless. John was just as great. There is nobody else I would trust more with my decision. I will be sending both Dennis and John lots of potential purchasers directly in the future.  5 stars all the way around. ",5.0
3978,"July 22, 2014","My wife and I went to Toyota of Plano and were met with exceptional service by Mustafa Al-Far! At first we were unsure about whether we wanted a RAV4 or Camry, but Mustafa helped us immensely through the process. Whenever we had a question, he would answer it truthfully and amiably. He gave us the pros and cons, and never forced us to make a decision. Within the first visit, he let us test drive the two vehicles and introduced us to all the different options and perks each offered. Even after 45 minutes, when we needed more time to discuss, he let us go without being at all coercive or offended. When we came back to buy the RAV4 the following week, he again  worked with us and allowed us to pick the specific car of our choice, even before it was off the car hauler! He had all the qualities of a great car consultant-- friendly, patient, understanding, and diligent. We were glad Mustafa, who fully represented the qualities of a great dealership, was the one who guided us through the buying process.

Keith Burr replied back very quickly that same night that the vehicle was available.  He answered all of my questions the next morning, and we decided to purchase the vehicle right then.  When we showed up at the dealership later than evening, we were met by Brian Salm, who explained that Keith was out sick that day and had been helping us from home.  Brian showed us our new RAV4 and explained how he was able to offer the RAV4 at such a great price.  I asked if he had any other ""great deals"" available, he showed us some certified pre-owned Camry's.  I did some online researching and didn't find anything comparably priced to what he offered me.

He is disingenuous, condescending and once you tell him you don't want to buy the extended warranty, which we told him 10 times , he got an attitude with us.  We almost walked out and canceled the deal.  Only because of the friend I brought with me and that we like Sal very much, we did not cancel the deal.

He was very easy-going and relaxed and did not pressure us to make a purchase. He brought us drinks twice while we were there. His assistance was invaluable in picking out our new Camry. Moe worked to get us a great deal once we had decided on a car and was very willing to work with us on pricing and financing to fit our needs. Sam walked us through the purchasing process and answered all of our questions without hesitation. Even after the paperwork was signed Moe has followed up several times to make certain we are satisfied with our purchase. We will encourage all of our friends to visit Toyota of Plano and trust that they will be taken care of.

4033,"June 23, 2014","I showed up to the service center about 10 minutes before 7 PM to pick up a rental vehicle covered under my Toyota warranty. Everything would have been a routine process except I am not the policyholder for my car insurance and the vehicle is co-titled with my mother who lives in another state. Cookie explained that because all the insurance documents I brought with me contained only my mother's name that she needed to verify my eligibility with the insurance company. 

We each tried getting through to the insurance company separately. Cookie patiently waited about 30 minutes with me for a representative to come on the phone. Meanwhile, the service center was shutting down for the evening. Finally, we were able to get the information necessary to approve my rental but not before having to conference call with my mother to verify her policy for the insurance company for them to release the right info to Cookie to complete the rental process.   

I am very grateful that Cookie waited with me nearly a full hour after the service center closed to help me get a rental car back to my neighborhood 23 miles south of Plano. Throughout the whole ordeal, she was extremely professional and courteous. It is clear that she values both her position and the service she provides to her clients. I will definitely come back to the Service Center at Toyota of Plano when I have future issues with my vehicle because of the friendly and helpful individuals like Cookie who work there.  ",4.6

4036,"June 21, 2014","     I was searching online for a used mid sized 6 cylinder SUV with front wheel drive to tow behind our motor home.  I was surprised that only 3 came up but after further studying, I learned that after 2012 the RAV4 did not make a 6 cylinder model.  While looking over this car's information the chat person gave me Brian Salm's name.  I wanted to see this car so i made an appointment to look at it the next day.  Brian was delightful and he directed the information to me, a woman, and not Lee who was with me as some sales people have done in the past.  I felt that he was very respectful, efficient, and to my knowledge, very honest.   We drove the car around and he answered all that I asked.  I felt that this was a very good deal and I wanted this car.   We filled out all the paperwork and then he sent me in to Tony Yazbeck, the finance person.
      I was surprised to find that Tony was as delightful as Brian.  I could tell he was a very busy man by all the piles of yellow envelopes of car that had sold just that day, yet he took time to explain everything and answer all my questions.   If the rest of the staff is just half as kind and helpful as these two fine gentlemen, you have a very OUTSTANDING dealership indeed.
      I have never considered buying a car to be a pleasant affair but these two changed my mind.   I would recommend both of them to any and all who asked.    Toyota of McKinney is twice as close as your dealership but because of the good experience I had there, I feel that I will be bringing my new RAV4 to your place.    Please pass on to these two men that their kindness and service was most appreciated.

Sean is very personable and very easy to work with. I went in knowing the type of car I wanted; which they did not have on the lot. Sean went way and beyond the necessary steps to ensure I got the vehicle I wanted. Sean listened to my needs and addressed my concerns. After listening to me Sean found the exact car I wanted. It was located in another City. Sean personally went to the other city to pick up my car and have it transfered to his lot.

I made the comment about wanting a back up camera on my car upon test driving it. Sean heard me and made sure that he addressed that need as well.  He went and talk with matience to see if installing a back up camera on my car was possible. No one could give Sean a solid yes or no as to if a back up camera could be installed on my car. Most people would have given up by now, but Sean didn't. He found out that they could install the back up camera and help to set me up with an appoitment to make sure I got the back up camera I wanted.

4067,"June 05, 2014","We had been to another dealership the day before and did not have a good experience.  Needless to say, we had a bit of a chip on our shoulder and were “hoping” not to have to endure such obvious hard-sell tactics and waste of time as experienced the day before.  We needed/wanted to buy a car by week’s end --- and with any luck, by day’s end.   After reading reviews on Dealerrater, we decided to visit Toyota of Plano, where we had the pleasure of working with Philip Hensarling in the purchase of a new RAV 4.



From the first hello it was positive.    Philip walked out unto the lot and introduced himself and asked what we were there for.  We had limited time, a goal to accomplish, and after the previous day’s antics, we got right to the point.  Perhaps a bit more direct than normal, but we were so worn out from the day before we thought it may be doing them a favor to express exactly what will make us buy (and music to a salesperson’s ears --- “today”  :-) ).  We didn’t need a test drive or more product information.  Being that we had just met a few minutes ago, imagine it took tremendous restraint NOT to keep selling at that point…. but Philip did it!   

He listened, comprehended, shifted gears and said “let’s get down to business” and we walked inside!   He began asking specific questions to “build” our vehicle.  He also respected our willingness, or lack thereof, to provide perhaps answers to some of the stock questions on the dealership’s standard qualifying “ questionnaire.   It was nice to work with a professional,  who could zig & zag with the individual client’s needs, expectations and personality.  

Within a relatively short period of time they had located the vehicle and we got “down to business”.  There were no high-pressure tactics and we worked solely with Philip as he would excuse himself to obtain pricing information from his supervisors.   Towards the end of negotiations, Philip asked if it would be alright for his sales manager to join us and we said “sure”.   In walks John Fulgoni and probably within about 10 mins we “had a deal”!   Despite the fact that he’s from Boston and a Red Sox fan ;-),  it was a pleasant negotiations from beginning to end. 

 

The car was delivered as promised and Philip went the extra mile again.  My husband had to go out of town and Philip drove approx 60 miles round trip to pick me up so we could take delivery of the vehicle.  



Towards the end of the transaction we discovered that Philip was “new” to the dealership and industry.   We NEVER would’ve known.  A knowledgeable professional and if he doesn’t know the answer he will find out for you.  A person of many attributes --- and most important of all in sales - “listening” and not wasting your client’s time.    Philip is a natural.   


 
 When we arrived at the dealership to take delivery of the RAV, Philip had me inspect the vehicle inside and out.  We had the windows tinted and appreciated the ""attention to detail"" of them taping the controls to prohibit operation until the windows dried in 2 days.   Then he escorted me to the Business Managers office for the completion of the paperwork.    Pleasant,  smooth and efficient.  Philip once again returned to now go into detail about the vehicle and review all the bells & whistles.  With today’s technology, that was very much appreciated.  We’ve taken delivery of over 12 vehicles in our lifetime and I have NEVER had such a thorough and professional NEW VEHICLE DELIVERY as I had with Philip.   He really took the time to do it right and it didn’t go unnoticed.   



Would definitely recommend Philip and in a year when our Prius lease is expiring it will be nice to know we “don’t have to shop around”. We’ll just do our research on the internet, go to Plano, see Philip and walk away with a new vehicle.    ",5.0

I spoke with Jacoub Oueini on the phone about new and used cars, and he checked and confirmed for me over the phone that a new car offer I saw online was still in effect.  When I arrived at Toyota of Plano (which was on a Saturday evening, only about an hour before closing time), Jacoub met me in the parking lot and introduced me to Mustafa Al-Far in new car sales, who then helped me with my new car purchase.  He very quickly ran my credit to confirm that I qualified for the special dealer financing offer that I was interested in.  He showed me various Camry models and colors, and we test drove the one I liked best.

Once I had selected a vehicle, Mustafa did a great job of explaining everything and completing the process.  At the same time, Jacoub came back by to check and see how everything was going.  Then, I met with Mark Miller in financing, who very patiently gave me a detailed explanation of the financing and the additional warranty/protection programs that were offered.

Once I had completed all the paperwork, Mustafa and  Jacoub were still there, took me around, and showed me some of the features in the car.  By the time we finished and I drove home, it was well past closing time.  Each of Jacoub, Mustafa and Mark stayed past closing time to help me complete the process.

He then went through and explained the pricing on the Prius and the warranty.  When it came time to appraise the Jeep, he went out of his way to get me a fair price on my trade-in.

I visited the showroom and we went over their inventory. They did not have the exact match I was looking for but had one on order from the factory that was due to arrive in the time frame I wanted.  We closed the sale and they delivered the vehicle 2 weeks early. Exactly what I wanted, 7 miles on the odometer and with none of the high pressure sales techniques that other dealers tried on me.  They offered other services like extended warranty, etc. with zero pressure.  I will buy there again (of course if the price is right!).

The salesman was very knowledgeable about the car, it's features and how to make everything work.  Took the time to show me how to pair the phone with the system, operate all the gadgets, doors, spare.  Pointed out the new things added since I bought my last Toyota in '07.  That was very helpful.

Mustafa was very courteous, well-mannered, and friendly.  He was the first one to approach me despite me being dressed very casually.  I’ve had issues at other lots where the salesmen seen me and then behave as though I wasn’t worth their time even though I was ready to purchase.  When he did approach he did so to ask if I’d been helped and what I was interested in.  He was not forceful in trying to get me to look at anything in particular and he let me just look around.  He let me tell him what I wanted and what I was looking to spend.  He was patient while I looked at many different vehicles in my price range and some a little above.  He made me feel like he was truly working for me and cared about how my experience would be.  The car I picked ended up being a little above my price range, but he stated he would work hard to get me into that car for a price I would be happy with.  He did not offer any leading or false promises, but he did give me hope that I could walk out of the dealership satisfied with my experience and purchase.  He worked hard in getting the price I needed the car to be so I could purchase the car with his dealership after some negotiating.  Two weeks after buying the car Mustafa was still was very attentive even though it was a busy time for him.  He helped me put the plates on and walked me back to the parts department to find out how much some parts would be that I wanted added.

I took a toyota Rav4 XLE 2014 from toyota of plano. The purchase experience was pleasant and I do not have any complaints. Its the after sales service which I would give 10 on a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being extremely poor. I was told that I would get a call once they have received my license plates. I purchased on 03/11 and they received the plates on 03/21. They did not call me. I was calling them every week to enquire on this and they would say they haven't received the plates. I have emailed Kal Mian a number of times asking for the plates and he would reply they didn't receive the plates. I spent $69 for a rental vehicle to take my road test for my license. and on 04/24 when I called them, they said they have received the plates on 03/21. When I asked for a compensation, one manage spoke very rudely like its not his problem that I paid for the rental vehicle and I can complain to Toyota which I have done.

Also on the service, my windshield mirror lights did not work, I had a wheel balancing problem and noise while braking when backing up and braking on slow speed and noise when backing up. I got it serviced twice and apart from the wheel balancing, nothing has been done properly. The part for the lights they said they did not have it in stock and would order it.

I felt  Sales Manager Matt Hashem and Ermin Komic in Finance worked as a team with Sonny Ismail to make my Camry purchase a seamless process at a great price.  I can honestly say Toyota of Plano exceeded my expectations.  
Lastly, I think my 2014 Camry XLE is going to give me many years of driving enjoyment.

4170,"March 31, 2014","I went through Consumer Reports and used their true value service, which gave me internet pricing from 6 or 7 DFW Toyota Dealerships.  Toyota of Plano had one of the more competitive prices per my research on various car websites.  Many of the dealerships were aggressive in their phone calls, telling me that the lower price given me by Toyota of Plano and another dealership were not ""possible"" and that I was being played.  I went to Toyota of Richardson in person, was told the same thing and was countered with a price $1,100 over that of Toyota of Plano.  Needless to say, when I went to Toyota of Plano, I was skeptical.  However, with NO hidden costs, no haggling, no ""oops we just sold that vin"", I got the price they promised through Consumer Reports and the exact Prius I wanted. Everyone was very nice and helpful.  The entire purchase and financing was absolutely pressure free.  After purchasing the car through Lee Mitchell, Gil Selasky spent over an hour with me in my new car going over the controls, showing me how to set radio stations, interpret the gauges, set things on navigations, how to start the keyless car, open the trunk, etc  (yes, I needed this because my prior car was a 2000 model...very basic and key based...

4174,"March 27, 2014","First off.. I've been through the process of buying a new vehicle twice in the past 2 years. Unfortunately my first purchase with Toyota of Plano, a 2012 Scion tC, only made it to year two. It was totaled in an accident a couple of weeks back. Overall, I was very nervous with the whole situation as this was my first accident ever, let alone in a leased vehicle. If i had one thing to recommend to anyone purchasing a new vehicle, it would be to get GAP insurance. This is a no-brainer. Without it my accident could have been far worse in terms of financial damage. After insurance cleared everything up with Toyota, i came back looking to get into a new vehicle, trusting in the outstanding service i had received in the two years prior. I walked in and was directed straight to Gil Selasky. He was very straight and to the point and asked what i was looking for exactly. I responded saying that i was looking to get into a truck and that i needed to weigh my financial options. His response was: ""Let's go find you exactly what you are looking for and we'll work through the financials later."" This assured me that he was there to help me get what i wanted, and that he would work with me every step of the process. Which he did. I test drove a beautiful new 2014 Tundra Crewmax and knew as i pulled off the lot for a test drive that i had found my new ride. After testing out the wheels, we made our way in to work through the ""fun"" part of the car buying experience. This is where Matt came in. Matt is the Sales Manager. He sat down with myself and Gil and worked through financing options with me. Being in a sales myself, i was glad to grind it out with these guys. Matt was a professional, without being too forward. It never seemed like i was being pushed into making a decision. My choice was my own and Matt made the process that much easier. We worked out one heck of a deal on the best vehicle i have ever driven. I signed the dotted line and was ready for the real paperwork. Having some minor issues on my credit history held the process up a tad bit. Then Ray comes around the corner and i recognize him from the last time i had purchased a vehicle. He came over shook my hand and said ""You're good, let's make a deal!"" This alone has made me a customer for life. The fact that my credit history says one thing but my character says another.. and Ray appreciated that. The last part of my buying experience, left me at the desk of Adel. He explained the fine print in detail and left no questions in my mind that i had made the right decision. I was pleased with the entire experience this time around. I have recommended Toyota of Plano to a few friends who are in the market for new vehicles. I have no doubts that they will have a similar experience. Thanks ToP for everything! ",5.0

I have owned many Toyota vehicles since 1988 without any problems.  I was looking to get a new Toyota.  So I decided to try a different dealership and selected Toyota of Plano.   I was met at the door by Israel Moncada who greeted me with a smile and inquired how he could help me.  I was surprised as I thought it was one of the maintenance staff.  Normally a salesperson ""descends"" on you like a vulture; Israel did not.  He was courteous and after seeing to my comfort, he proceeded to review my needs in a vehicle.  He next selected the models I wanted and we walked out to see the vehicles.  He pointed out all the features and answered my questions on each.  Once I indicated which vehicle I was most interested in we returned inside and he worked up a pricing schedule for the different terms available.  At no time did he pressure me or indicate he had to ""check with my manager"" - he just did the numbers and asked which one would best suit my budget considerations.  Once I decided, Israel scheduled my meeting with the financial department where the transaction was concluded.   ALL in just 2.5 hours, if that long.  Without any fuss or bothersome ""need to talk to my manager"" interruptions.  I was very pleasantly surprised at how smooth and pain free this car buying experience was at this dealership.   I highly recommend the dealership and in particular Israel Moncada as the salesperson to negotiate with.  No pressure, no fuss, no muss.    A truly different and refreshing experience.   .........

4203,"March 06, 2014","Upon entering the door of this dealership for the first time, my husband and I were immediately greeted, welcomed, and placed in the capable hands of a salesman by the name of Jeremy DeCarlo.  Jeremy determined the model of Toyota that seemed to interest us and then found exactly what we were looking for.  He literally spent hours with us as we road tested two vehicles and introduced us to all of special features of each one.  Later on he helped us reach the exact price that we wanted to pay for our new vehicle and worked diligently to make sure that we were happy with every small detail of the transaction.  We were then directed to Adel Sammak  who talked to us about vehicle registration,  warranty offers, and various other details involved with purchasing a new vehicle from Toyota of Plano.  He was friendly, helpful, and very informative about the service that we can expect as new owners of our Toyota.  Buying a new car is not an easy process, but these two employees of Toyota of Plano made our experience about as pleasant as it possibly could be, for which we are very thankful.  Needless to say, we are very satisfied and happy new customers of this dealership.    ",4.8

4205,"March 05, 2014","I have to say that Clyde went out of his way to order the exact Tacoma Pick Up we were looking for and needed. 

I appreciate all extra time that he spent helping me.  

I appreciate Israel explaining to me how the blue tooth, backup camera, radio and other option worked. 

I was really surprised when Clyde & Israel told me and checked to make sure I had a full tank of gas, that was an unexpected surprise to find out about, when they told me. 

I appreciate being shown the service department and telling me about the free oil changes, rotating tires every 5000 miles or 6 months 

I have to say I would definitely recommend to any one looking to purchase a vehicle to visit with Clyde or Israel at Toyota Plano before shopping any where.

I did a lot of research on vehicles before contacting the dealership, and Sean Li worked with me to find exactly the car I was searching for.  Initially they did not have the color combination I wanted in stock.  A week later, they got one in inventory, and Sean contacted me and answered all the questions I had about the vehicle, sending pictures of the car as well.  He was great to work with over the phone and via email, and we got all the paperwork out of the way in less than two hours when I stopped by the dealership to complete my purchase.
Ermin in Finance was very straightforward when we went over the paperwork and didn't try to push any extras.  The two guys I had contact with at Toyota of Plano were very professional, which made this car-buying experience as painless as possible.

4218,"February 25, 2014","I must admit, I had an attitude when I walked into Toyota of Plano Used Dealership. It had be 20 years since I'd purchased my 1994 Toyota 4Runner. Back then you'd get to the dealership at 2 pm, and fought over a car deal until 9-10 o-clock!?!

Not this time. I found Carlos Lazo online thru Truecars.com. When I got there, he met me at the door and immediately informed me that the online ad was somewhat miss-leading, and that the real car was a totally different color. Surprisingly it turned out the vehicle was 100 times better than what I expected to see. Carlos was the perfect gentlemen. He was able to convey his knowledge of the product without seeming over-bearing or pushy. He simply gave me all the details I wanted to know about the car, and of course inquired about how soon I'd be willing to lock down a deal.

I normally would've taken more time to think through such a purchase, but it just didn't seem necessary. Carlos had presented himself, and the car clearly to me with no hidden surprises. I found him to be sensitive to my situation, and was willing to hold car for just the right amount of time for me to make the call.

The neatest treat for me, other than finding my perfect car, was dealing with a great sale person like Carlos. Thank you Carlos for my 2011 KIA Sorento! I am ONE VERY HAPPY Customer!!

We did not have an appointment and Keith Burr was very friendly, attentive and extremely helpful.  We went to several other dealerships in the area and no one gave us the level of service that Keith did.  In fact, at one dealership, we were not even greeted and left after 15 minutes.  We had to find a salesperson at the other, where Keith enthusiastically greeted us as soon as we walked in the door.  

We were offered several competitive prices for the Prius C elsewhere but specifically chose to return to Toyota of Plano because of the excellent customer service.

4224,"February 22, 2014","I am 68, so over my lifetime I have purchased many vehicles and dealt with a number of dealerships.  Like most people I dread the trip to the dealership to select the vehicle and arrive at an agreeable price.  I was amazed by the staff my wife and I met and dealt with at Toyota of Plano.  Everything was made easy.  The vehicle selection was made easy by the staff after we told them what we were interested in and was immediately brought to the front door of the showroom.  Arriving at an agreeable price is usually a challenge and most of the time very frustrating.  The staff demonstrated to us they really wanted to sell us the vehicle we chose and arriving at the purchase price turned out to be easy.  We told the sales staff we did not want to go through a lot of add-on sales pitches during the signing of the papers in the business office and they honored our request.  They detailed the vehcile, and walked us around the vehicle and showed us how to use all the features of the vehicle.

We initially dealt with Faz Imaam, Internet Sales Director, but he ask us to work with Sean Li, Internet Sales Director.  Both of these gentlemen could not have been more pleasant to work with.  Sean was very knowledgable and eager to address all our questions and concerns.  Both Sean and Faz were there to thanks us and ensure everything had been taken care of as we left.

We are extremely happy with our purchase, a 2014 Toyota RAV4, and our experience at Toyota of Plano.  We will not hesitate to let others know our feeling about the dealership and we will return in the future.

4235,"February 17, 2014","I have a 2004 Tundra with 138,000 miles on it. It started making a noise/vibration on the highway. I took it in and was told that I needed to replace the differential which would be $2,800. When Anthony called to tell me, I asked if they had checked the U-joint and he said, ""yes, they're fine"". I told him not to repair anything and I'd investigate a little more.

I did some research online and visited with a friend that knows more about cars than me (should have done that sooner). Both sources indicated a bad u-joint. Learning to check it myself from sources online, I was able to test the u-joints (with gloves and 2 minutes) and found one of three was bad. Took it to another local mechanic who replaced the u-joint ($132) and he checked my differential...no issues there.

My belief is that Toyota of Plano service department is very dishonest and are trying to scare customers with higher-mileage vehicles into trading for a much lower trade-in values citing ""expensive repairs needed"". Do not trust them or at least get a second opinion from a non-dealer mechanic. I'm done with them.

Also, on a recent visit with my wife's van, I was looking for someone to give me an update since it was taking much longer than expected.

He also warned her about dangers of texting and made her promise that she would not text and drive.

Tony in the finance department was also EXCELLENT. He was very clear and made everything easy to understand and was also very quick. I ended up purchasing a 2008 Buick Lucerne and I love it.

John worked it out where I could take the car to show my wife even though I live in Grand Prairie. At first she had second thoughts but after a week end and part of Monday morning she came around to our thinking. John was able to hold the vehicle for a more than normal time for me to be able to get her to my way of thinking. John again has bent over back words to help me purchase this vehicle. I can never repay John for all of his help.
Thanks again for all the help.

Then I expressed interest in test driving and looking a some color combinations for the Avalon.  What I really appreciated was Sam's honesty in calling me and telling me he did not have one of the exact models before I came out.  This is what convinced me he would be someone I could work with.  I went out to Toyota Plano and worked with Sam & I'm very satisfied with the outcome.,4.8

Brian was very prompt and professional in his response, no pressure, offering any information via e-mail to get me all the details and schedule an on-site visit.  This was perfect as I had a busy day and couldn't be tied up too much on the phone outside of work.  Brian even offered to pick me up at a nearby rental site where I was returning a car.  

On arrival to the premises, my wife and I were greeted even as we were exiting our vehicle and quickly directed us to Brian.  Brian was immediately prompt and efficient showing us to the vehicle up front, having prepped it for our visit, so we immediately went for a test drive and felt like we were talking to an old friend on a leisurely drive.  Brian offered us a comparison of financing options stating that he thought they could be competitive than our own bank, they were.   

After a brief introduction to Sam Kaar, we were quickly discussing terms and warranty options, all the time having a nice chat and feeling very welcome, not rushed.  We were relaxed, making Facebook jokes and all the while felt we were being given the service that we came to buy and not anything someone was selling us.  Sam stated that he could make some adjustments to the options for warranty that actually worked out better to our needs and keeping with the previously agreed pricing.  

We drove home happy in a very nicely equipped vehicle and felt after all of our research and the visit that we had absolutely been satisfied with the best deal, the best dealer experience, and satisfaction after the sale.

He did everything he could to negotiate a deal that would satisfy both of our needs and even went back and forth with his sales manager a few times after I left the dealership.  It appeared that the sales consultant, Sal, was at the whim of the sales manager for price negotiations.  I did get a fair trade in offer as it was comparable to a few other dealersihps.  In terms of negotiating sales price, they came off a little greedy.  THe car was advertised and marked at $25,999 and they were only willing to go down a couple hundred bucks.  After leaving the dealership they proceeded to mark up the car.  It appears that when they saw they could sell the car quickly, even at a price they could make money at, they preferred to hold out.  Sal was very helpful going back and forth over the next few days seeing if other offers would work as I evaluated other cars.  At the end of the day I purchased the car because it was the only option with the exterior and interior colors I was wanting and was willing to pay a couple grand for.  The day I made my mind up, I called Sal if they would honor their original offer.  They did, despite marking the price up, and Sal came up on his day away from the office to close the deal.  He was really great to work with.

For financing I worked with Sam.  This was typical auto finance experience.  They tried to offer their financing but didn't offer to beat my rate, pushed insurance and warranty plans, etc.  He was not too pushy though and was respectful when I declined.

He was one of the only dealers that gave me a price in the beginning and after speaking to Matt on the phone I knew that he was someone that I wanted to see. I had no intent on purchasing a new car that day and I had intended to check out three other Toyota dealers and a Honda dealership to shop all prices. I have to say that shopping for a new car is not one of my favorite things to do, way too many aggressive sales people that have their own agenda and are often not very honest and act like a great white shark in a sea full of chum circling for the kill. When I arrived at Toyota of Plano there was none of that and after speaking to Matt I could tell that he was very knowledgeable about his product but he really seemed that he was willing to help me get a fair price on a vehicle that was what I wanted and needed. Matt listened to what the customer said and was there to fulfill what I wanted, not a sales quota or what he was loaded up in inventory. Matt has a great personality, easy going, no pressure and very professional manner. I was in music retail for thirty years and I would have hired him for my store on the spot, Stellar salesman. He helped me find the right car and that was the only car that I drove. I had purchased a Sienna many years ago, so I was fairly familiar with the product, but Matt blew me away with all of the new options and accessories and he got me all rebates and discounts that we had ever discussed. I actually had very nice time at this dealership and my car buying experience went from very negative to great!

I was channeling the Grinch, upset by the timing of everything and determined not to find myself in a car I either didn't like or one that would blow our budget into another dimension. I did my research, and armed with an exact make and model, I contacted several local dealers. Why did I choose Toyota of Plano? Simple. Brian Salm gave off a laid back, pleasant vibe. The man had a sense of humor, which made it impossible for me to stay grumpy. We zipped through the paperwork, he answered every question I could think to ask, and then I met Tony Yazbeck in Financing. I had my pre-approved loan from my bank so other than signing paperwork, the time flew past. Brian and Tony engaged me in conversation, learning what was important to me, and sharing their own experiences. By the time we'd finished, I would have taken both home and fed them pie. First impressions do matter, and in the car business, the moment a customer is engaged is when the clock starts ticking. Brian was easy to talk to, easy to work with, and easy to like.

A quick story about Matt - about 6 months ago I was having an issue with my 1996 Toyota LandCruiser. I could not raise anyone in the service department so I decided to call Matt (I had met him one day while having service done on our Sienna). Within 5 minutes, someone was calling me from the service department, set up appointment and took care of my needs. Though TOP was not the lowest price in town (was within $200) I decided to spend a little extra for the level of service that Matt provided and I know will continue to provide in the future.

We are currently a 3 Toyota family (Sienna, LandCruiser and Corolla), looking forward to a long relationship with TOP.

Facing 81000 miles over 5 1/2 years we knew it was going t be a rough day.  Then, we met Jason Nutt. He opened the door asked us what type of car we were looking for and was the epitome of professionalism ...no question was stupid, he didn't just answer my husbands questions he realized I was the buyer and addressed me! That may be meaningless to many people but being my family's car buyer it makes my life easier, and the buying process a breeze. Jason confirmed along the process we were real buyers asking us our bottom line. He didn't insult our intelligence with ""now I need to speak with my manager"" he negotiated until we got the car we wanted at the price we wanted to pay.

4345,"November 19, 2013","When I went to your Pre-owned store on Preston, my intent was to ""shop"" i.e. see what there was available to add to the looking I had already done by internet.  I didn't expect to find ""just the right car"" on one visit.  So I was more unprepared than I wish I would have been for what transpired.  It had been 12 years since I bought a car, and I had forgotten a lot of the procedure.

Jacoub was very helpful and answered all my questions (of which there weren't very many because of what I say above).  I found him straightforward and felt I could trust what he said.

I went home after the initial visit and did some more checking and found that everything he had told me about the car was accurate.  I wanted a mid-size vehicle that handled well and would last me a while.  I like the styling and the vehicle is in good shape.  It is not all that often that you find a 1-owner car with 12,000 miles on it.  From the checking I did, it was priced fairly and I didn't see any reason to postpone the purchase.

EXCEPT that I had originally planned to make a purchase about the middle of December when I would have had a larger down payment.  That is the one regret that I have about the purchase--that I would have liked to have had a larger down payment, which I could have had by the middle of December.

On the other hand, I think my old car might not have lasted that long...!

I am happy with the car and know I will be happy having dealt with your dealership.  I felt I was treated courteously and fairly by Jacoub (and later, Tony), and at no time felt like what I was being told might not be true.  I have had many friends tell me that I would be happy dealing with Toyota personnel and with the products they represent.  You have built a solid reputation of commitment to quality and service.",5.0

We went dealership to dealership in hopes of a need car, and that we could be lucky enough to also find a dealership who would work with us due to not past credit history. We went to several dealerships in the area, and felt extremely discouraged. It seemed to us that no one would give us the opportunity to 1) start our credit and 2) help our family grow for the better. Before heading home, we decided to stop at the Toyota of Plano dealership. As we exited our car and headed to the front door we were greeted by a young gentlemen, he opened the door for us, and soon introduced himself. Parker Nelson. He asked us the reason for our visit, and there we told him all about our situation. How we were in desperate need of a new family friend car, and yet we felt stuck due to lack of credit. We had just been told by the Ford dealership near by that there was ""nothing that could be done for us"". Parker told us other wise. He said he would do everything in his power to help us, and to get us into a new car. He was friendly, and very positive which at that moment was just what we needed after a long day of no's. He showed us multiple cars, and gave us his own opinion on what he thought would work best for us. He jotted down our information, and told us he was going to go get one of the sales manager. The sales manager came over and greeted us also very friendly, and told us that our best bet would be to get a co-signer and to come back. Parker told us he would try and come up with ideas, and give us a call if he had any. We then left the dealership, and before even arriving home, Parker sent us a text saying thank you for coming in, and he hoped to help us get into our dream car. A few days later, we received a call to follow up, and see if we had found anyone to co sign. We did indeed find a co-signer, and went back to the dealership. We had some rough patches at times in which we thought we might not get the car we wanted, but through it all Parker stayed positive which kept us thinking that way too. Through the entire experience Parker called/e-mailed/texted us to keep us up to date with how everything was going. He made us feel like valued customers, which made a stressful situation that much better. After about a week of figuring out numbers, and the best thing for our family we finally got it all figured out, and went into the dealership to trade in our current car for a beautiful brand new Rav4. We have now had our car for almost 3 weeks, and it has made a HUGE difference in our lives. We will always be loyal to Toyota and the great cars they have. Also, as long as we are near this area we will go to Toyota of Plano and give our business to Parker.

He knew what other vehicle makes I was looking for and gave me advice as to how they compared to the Toyota I was considering.  I took a week to continue my shopping and he stayed in touch but didn't pressure me.  In the end, all the advice he gave me was accurate and I made the decision to buy the Toyota from him.  He did an excellent job handling the purchasing process and then passed me on to the Finance Manager, Tony who was equally professional and very efficient.  My experience was extraordinary and I will go back when it's time to buy another vehicle.

We made a decision to buy the Forerunner 15 minutes after our arrival and test drive.  I was very disappointed that it took close to two hours 

before our paper work was ready to execute.  We paid cash for the Toyota so there should not have been a lengthy credit evaluation.  The 

explanation we received was that there were 3 or 4 people ahead of us.  If that were the case, I would suggest that Toyota of Plano is 

understaffed on Saturday if it takes two hours to ""paper "" a cash deal. 

I was not impressed with the extended warranty promotion first from the ""manufacturer"" side and then the second warranty promotion at the 

time we signed the papers.  I made it very clear to Sam while signing the papers that extended coverage was not something we were 

in purchasing.  We have purchased 5 Toyotas over the past 15 years because they are dependable and durable.

4410,"September 23, 2013","This review is for the Pre-owned department at Toyota of Plano. My husband and I were in the market for a used 4runner and found one at Toyota of Plano. We had a great test drive, we really enjoyed driving the car and decided that we would move forward with buying it. On our test drive we did notice that when we turned the steering wheel to the left we heard a very obvious and worrisome knocking noise and we wanted this to be addressed before we signed anything binding us to the purchase of the vehicle so, we decided we wanted to run and get a quick lunch and return back so that they were able to have time to fix the issue. Earlier in the day as our salesman was trying to close the deal he mentioned that someone else was interested in the same car and that they were on their way to look at it. As we were leaving for lunch the Manager Ken Johnson came over and pushed for us to sign the papers before leaving to ensure that the other customers wouldn't buy the car. At this point we had not driven the car since our initial test drive and for all we knew the knocking noise had not been addressed (conveniently the car was still on the lift in the service department with all 4 wheels taken off). We came back in 30 minutes at 3:00 and the other customers (who were apparently coming from Fort Worth but had been ""on their way"" since 12:00) had still not arrived. We found our salesman and asked him to pull up the car so that we could give the final approval and Ken came up and rudely told us that he would not sell us the car and was holding the vehicle for the other customers and if they decided not to buy it we would be able to. So bottomline is, they would not hold the car for us to go grab a quick lunch that would give them time to fix the issue but, they would hold the car for the customers that had been on their way for 3 hours (truly it is a 1 hour drive at most) even though they were going to sell us the car 30 minutes earlier right from under the other people. With the rudeness of the manager, the sketchy handling of the situation and the time we wasted that day we will never return to Toyota of Plano.

Jacoub was nice and low pressure and assured us he wanted to be our first and last stop in the Dallas area shopping for a Prius.  The prices and availability of the exact car we wanted, as well as his friendly personality led us straight to Toyota of Plano, Pre-owned.  There we found our car, and Jacoub came out and found us.  He was so funny, we had a good time, he also continued to check on us throughout the finance portion of the transaction.
We will be in the market for another Toyota, (possible Avalon vs Venza) in the upcoming months and we will certainly call on Jacoub first to see if he has any inventory we would be interested in.
He is a great asset to your company, he represents you well.  Never had such a fun time buying a car, which is usually a terrible experience.
Thank you, and we'll be seeing Jacoub soon, our first and last stop to buy our cars.  :)

4455,"August 21, 2013","I started my sale using the chat feature available from the website.  This transitioned seamlessly from the site to my sales person, Sal.  This experience is the only reason the dealership got a good rating.  My experience with Sal was better than a 5.  He was polite, intelligent, and exceptionally helpful.  He provided me with the information I needed and helped at every step along the way.  After that my experience went down hill.  When Sam came into the picture my opinion dropped dramatically.  He used every delay tactic possible to coerse us into many things that we had declined multiple time.  He shuffled and reshuffled paperwork to stall our purchase making our experience very frustrating.  We left that night full of excitement for the next morning.  We made arrangements to pick up the car first thing in the morning after the bank finished processing the paperwork.  I arrived at the bank at 9 am and we contacted the dealership at 9:30.  We needed to have an invoice faxed over so that a payment could be made.  Again Sam started his tactics, he never sent the appropriate documents to the bank requiring another phone call an hour later.  After this phone call a bank representative contacted him again, to no avail.  Two subsequent phone calls, including a call from Sam trying to get me to not use my bank for financing, were required to finally get the documents.  This entire process took two and a half hours.  With all of that time spent you would surmise that he would find it important to expidite our processing once we arrived at the dealership, you would be wrong.  After our arrival we met Sal who went to Sam to get the temporary tags processesed.  We were advised that the tags would be put on the car and our keys were to be provided at that time.  After another half an hour wait I got up and contacted Sal, who was astonished that we were still waiting unassisted.  Sal walked right in and retrieved the tags and keys and had us on our way in minutes.  If it were not for Sal we would have canceled the sale and taken our business elsewhere.  Sam's inconsiderate vindictive behavior was not the action of a person who cared about the customer at all.  When someone asks me about the dealership I will advise them to leave immediately if they have to deal with Sam.  ",3.4

Jay Lee made this purchasing process so smooth and enjoyable: he went the extra mile trying to meet our need, helping us get the right price, and explaining in detail about the car (Highlander Limited) and many other things. We couldn't have asked for more! He also did an excellent job serving as the liaison with the finance department, so we already knew what we wanted to add (e.g., extended warranty) to the deal that we got. Jay Lee was simply outstanding and we were so lucky to have had him as sales manager! We thought that it would not be easy to find someone trustworthy, professional, efficient, and nice when dealing with car sales, but we found one here at Toyota of Plano! Jay Lee is the BEST car sales manager that we have ever met!

Tony was a pleasure to work with as well. He was professional and efficient. Unlike other finance people we had dealt with in the past and also recently, he respected what we wanted to have for our deal.

The closest dealership was in Plano and I called to inquire about it.  Isreal answered the phone and researched the inventory and then gave me the stock # so we could view it on line.  When we arrived at the dealership, Isreal had left for the day, so we were introduced to Merza.  He drove us right to the car I was interested on one of the back lots.  They had many vehicles to choose from. We asked a lot of questions about the car and we found Merza to be extremely knowledgeable about the vehicle and all the ""gadgets"".

Sam from the beginning of our conversation did not take us seriously. He talked down to me and barely answered any questions. 
I'm the person who asks certain questions I already know the answer to in order to determine what type of service and quality we'd receive from that dealership when dealing with warranties and repairs. 
Sam flat out lied about safety reviews as well as overall quality of the vehicle. During our test drive, he sat in the back seat and texted and talked on his phone, pausing only to say right or left.

But, I recently found myself in need of new, reliable transportation which, in turn, led me to Toyota of Plano.  I could not have had a better experience.  Upon arrival, I explained to the receptionist I was interested in seeing if I could fit into a Prius C (I am 6 feet 4 inches tall and tend to have issues finding cars that can provide sufficient legroom and well as headroom).  I was quickly greeted by Nolan and his trainee, Parker.  I explained to them I wanted to see if I could fit in the car.  Nolan simple said ""Let's go see"".  Thus began the most enjoyable car-buying experience I have ever had.  We went out into the lot, found a Prius C and tried it for comfort -- after a little seat adjusting, all was well there, so Nolan suggested we take it for a test drive.  However, the car was a THREE trim level and I was interested in a TWO level (fewer ""bells and whistles"" I would never use).  Parker quickly found one in a color I liked and we took that one for a nice test drive.  Nolan explained a great deal about the car and the various controls while I drove.  Once we returned to the lot, we went inside and discussed the car a little more.  I had pretty much already made up my mind the Prius C was the car for me (I had already test-driven several other cars that day, none of which appealed to me for various reasons).  We haggled briefly over the price of my trade-in, then agreed to a final cost of the new car.  Nolan and Parker took the car to be cleaned up while I completed the deal with Adel.  The cleaning took a bit longer than Nolan had anticipated, but he came by the waiting area several times to keep me updated.  When my new car was finally ready to go, Nolan helped me move the accumulated ""junk"" from my old car, then spent quite some time going over the Prius C again, patiently explaining many points I had failed to grasp properly during the test drive.

I can highly recommend Nolan, Parker, Adel, and Toyota of Plano.  The folks I dealt with were professional and pleasant and they seemed genuinely interested in making sure I was happy with the car and the transaction.",5.0

I came in on 7-11 at 3pm, service advisor john whitmire asked me to come back in the morning because they were slammed.  I said okay, came back on 7-12 at 7am.   I brought my toyota camry in for a diagnostic on why it has engine ping.  The service advisor said that customers don't know whats wrong with their vehicles and wanted to know what it sounded like and where it was coming from.  I said it sounds like rattling coming from the crankcase that happens when on the throttle and under a load, and that I knew for a fact it was engine ping because premium gas an octane boost eliminates the problem and another shop told me it had pre-ignition and to use better gas.  He would not listen to me, insinuated that I did not know what I was talking about and generally tried to make me feel stupid.  It sounds like a BB party under the hood and he said he did not hear anything when driving the car around the parking lot.  He refused to note pre-ignition so the mechanic looked for a Dash rattle.  I did not bring the car in for that. I never even heard a dash rattle and if it did I wouldn't care, i would care about the ping thats causing damage to my engine.  The whole trip was worthless and wasted and I didn't even get the issue looked at, they looked at the dash.  I paid for a diagnostic on pre-igniton and the service advisor screwed everything up and wouldn't take responsibility for not listening to me, took me to the mechanic and tried to pin it on the mechaninc then tried to convince me that using premium gas instead of regular would make it run better and it was a good thing.  Ok, its not a good thing when a car is designed to run on regular but has ping on regular.  The mechanic gave me a theory on why it might have ping and a quote for the induction service.  Thats all well and good but I didn't pay for speculation, i paid to have them look at the issue and find out forsure what is going on.

Then, someone stole the cash that was in my closed cupholder.  4 dollars in ones.  Someone in the chian of custody stole money out of my car.  Its ridiculous!

I saved my money up for a disgnostic and repairs from the dealership because they are supposed to know best and they screwed me over and treated me like I was stupid and then took it further and stole hidden money from my vehicle.  I built a 66 chevy, I am not car stupid and I resent this whole experience.",1.3

He wanted the best option for me, and worked very hard to get that for me. He was very serious about his work, but at the same time joked around. He was an interesting, genuine person to work with.

The car itself was pretty used, and was priced a little high for the value I thought it had. Jacoub was willing to work with the price as much as possible, but still seemed to be pricey for the amount of problems the car already had. Jacoub threw in a set of floor mats at the end, which was much appreciated. Overall, I am a very happy customer!",4.6

4501,"July 07, 2013","We purchased a 2013 Toyota Highlander (for me) and appreciated the genuine warmth and respect that was demonstrated throughout our entire experience at the dealership.  Our sales representative, Woody Woodard  went out of his way to answer all of our questions as we test drove and evaluated our top choices. We appreciated his demeanor throughout our experience.  He was engaged, informative and not pushy.  Everyone throughout theentire dealership and that we encountered was friendly, helpful and focused on customer satisfaction.

Negotiating our deal with Woody and Ray Bellamine (the New Car Sales Manager) was a win-win situation and made me excited to be a new Toyota owner and a customer of this dealership.  My husband has been a customer here since he bought a Prius 5 years ago and the recent remodel and expansion offers many benefits and amenities for customers that bring their vehicles in for service.

I have been a Honda owner and advocate for over 30 years and a long time customer of another local dealership for 26 of those 30, so this is a major transition for me.

Thank you Toyota of Plano for making this a fun, rewarding and hassle-free experience!

4505,"July 02, 2013","My wife and I went in to Toyota Of Plano with the hopes of purchasing a New Highlander. We had been to several dealerships before landing in Plano(about 30 miles from home) and everyone of them wanted to play games with the pricing, try and pressure us in to buying right that second or just being flat out rude. This was not the case from the moment we walked in to Toyota Of Plano. We we're greeted by someone at the front desk and we're quickly helped by Sam Albalouli with Tariq Hussein(we had exchanged a few emails the previous week) joining shortly after.  From the start we didn't feel any presure or like we we're getting the run around, everything seemed pretty straight forward. We went back and forth a little on the pricing but not nearly the dog fight experiance we had had at other dealerships and came to a great price for exactly what we wanted. All the paper work was done by Adel Sammak and he also didn't make us feel pressured when explaining all the extras(ex. warranty, GAP, Windshield/tire insurance, ect...) that we could purchase along with our new Highlander. Over all I'd say my wife and I are very plessed with the experiance we had at Toyota of Plano(a special thanks to Sam!) and would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a Toyota in the DFW area, even if you do need to drive almost an hour to get there!

My husband needed some service work on his Tundra Friday and he said I should come in and see if I wanted to trade my car in for a new one.
I came in with him and while I was waiting for him to come into the show room to join me I began talking with Amanda and Maria.  They were both very engaging. I asked Amanda who I should work with if I wanted to buy a car since I knew Herouy was no longer available.  She recommended John.  

I found John and he was just what she told me.  He was knowledgeble and straight forward and helped us get through all the red tape and find the car I wanted and we were in it and out in time for dinner.  Fastest and best car experience ever.

We have been repeat customers at your dealership due to the low pressure yet very helpful atmosphere.  I have to say you keep getting better and better.

Thank you all so much!

Israel helped me find the car I wanted and I've fallen in love with my new Prius.  He made sure that I was taken care of and reviewed the many options and pricing packages with me before I made my final decision.  I definitely felt like I was in good hands interacting with friendly and honest sales people.,5.0
4512,"July 01, 2013","I went to Toyota of Plano on a whim.  My intent to purchase a vehicle was not whimsical, just the time and place.  I was in Plano for a family reunion, but already knew I was going to buy a RAV4 in the near future.  It was Memorial Day weekend and I stopped by just in case there was something for me.  I had a good feeling.  When I drove up, Brian is the salesman that greeted me.  He was friendly, professional, and most imporantly, he seemed genuine.  He answered all of my questions knowledgeably and without feeling to ""salesy.""  He was really great about not making me feel pressured; I didn't feel rushed, even though I asked a lot of questions and took some time to think.  

After a lengthy visit, and much to Brian's uneasiness I'm sure, I had to leave to think about it.  Even though it was late afternoon, Brian offered to stay behind at the dealership for a couple of hours while I made up my mind.  As hasty as I can be sometimes, this purchase was going to be a big commitment.  I needed time to call my insurance company and also to research other dealerships to see how the price compared.  While doing that research, I found a dealership closer to home that was offering the same vehicle with fewer miles at a minimally higher price.  Being closer to home and having fewer miles, I decided the vehicle was worth a call to that dealership.  Fortunately for Brian and Toyota of Plano, the salesperson in New Orleans to whom I spoke was rude and immediately started pressuring me to go to the lot.  I gave him a piece of my mind about his customer service skills and immediately made my mind up to go back to T.O.P. and Brian.  

I spent many years in the customer service industry and good service from genuine people is important to me.  Important enough that after thinking of how Brian treated me, I decided right then that he deserved the sale.  He had earned it by just being a great person to work with who so obviously liked his job and his customers.  I returned to the dealership and everything else from signing the loan documents to meeting with the finanical department went as smoothly as it could have gone.  I never once felt schmoozed or pressured and the financial department guy (whose name I totally forgot, I'm sorry!!) was great, super friendly, fun, and helpful.  

I got to drive off the lot that day in my new car and have not had one single regret.  Unfortunately for me, not 10 days after being home, someone hit my new car in the parking lot at work resulting a little damage that required minimal body work.  I had to go through my insurance since the offender didn't stick around to apologize or provide insurance info.  The insurance agent handling the claim had to contact Brian and she made it a point to tell me how sorry he was about it and how he remembered me being so excited about my new car.  Just hearing that he even remembered me and the sale cemented my good opinion of his service and the dealership.  

I have already recommended Brian and Toyota of Plano to the next person I met who was interested in a RAV4 (in fact, it was at the insurance company's collision center when I picked up my car after being repaired!).  I can't put into words how happy I am that a fit of whimsy led me to this dealership and Brian Salm.  Thanks for everything!

I left Toyota of Richardson to talk to Sam about getting a better deal at Toyota of Plano.   I have to admit that I was a little skeptical af first, but made the decision to give Toyota of Plano to win my business.   The information I was told on the phone that lured me over to Toyota of Plano went just as I was told it would.  The pricing was exactly what I was promised.  I was really afraid of a ""bait and switch"" sales job but that did NOT happen at all.   Everyone at Toyota of plano was super friendly and fun to work with.  I especially enjoyed getting to work with Adel and Sam.    After explaining my son's financial situation, Adel made sure we purchased the warranty that would give my son the best value.   Sam quickly picked out the car that my son wanted and got it right into make ready.   I had a great experience at Toyota of Plano and will happily direct more business your way whenever I get the opportunity.

Thanks so much for giving me a better deal for my son.  Every dollar saved is a big deal for him at the age of 23.

I originally had a slightly difficult time getting ahold of my sales guy, but that's because he was on his way out the door (for good).  After that, I was reassigned to Karen who was great.  Somehow, the General Manager Rusty managed to get one of these FRSs expedited to me EXACTLY how I wanted it.  Correct color, trim, etc.  I got this EXCELLENT car in a short (maybe record breaking) 3 weeks.

It seemed like this dealer bent over backwards to make sure I got exactly what I wanted.  

My biggest fear was the finance department.  I read about other Scion/Toyota dealers PUSHING over priced warranties and dealer add-ons to increase profit.  NOT HERE!  The financing guy (Tony) was the most pleasurable finance director I've ever worked with at ANY big dealer.  He wasn't pushy at all.  He worked with me.  In the end, I paid less than expected and walked away with more than I bargained for.  

For this particular car, I planned on payments of $507 a month with $2500 down and NO add ons.  I managed to get my payments to $508 a month WITH a 100,000 mile Toyota extended warranty added (WELL worth the value), dealer installed window tinting, GAP protection (incase something happens to the car and I'm upside down on payments, smart to have with a new car) AND a great wheel/tire ""extended warranty.""

This is my 11th car to purchase in the last 36 months, so I'm no dummy to buying cars.

Months later when the car was available John immediately recognized me and showed me several units on the lot.

John continued my completely satisfied experience  by being extremely helpful, extremely professional, all the way through explaining (patiently) all the impressive features of my new Avalon when I picked up the car. 

Oh, and hey, I got a great deal, too!

My name is Janell Baker and I recently purchased a 2013 Toyota Sienna Limited from Toyota of Plano.  I worked with John Fulgoni, the Internet Sales Manager and Jay Hassell.  This is what my buying experiences was like.

John Fulgoni was absolutely wonderful to work with.  He was in constant communication with my husband and I before, during, and after our purchase.  He was extremely professional, very kind, and went out of his way to make the process flawless.  He was a big reason why we purchased from Toyota of Plano.  We had many opportunities to purchase from other dealerships closer to home in Rockwall but John and the rest of the sales team won us over.  He did so much to locate the van we wanted, and was always communicating with us during that process.  

I also want to thank Jay Hassell for working hard to provide us with the best of the best financing options.  He was extremely professional, quick and thorough, and very personable while processing our paperwork.  He served in our military & as a police officer and isextremely polished, kind, and professional....thank you again.

I was given the opportunity to rate John and feel as though I was a bit strict and unfair in not giving him all 10s but after reviewing everything I realized that if anyone deserved it, it was John...because of this I apologize to John and Toyota of Plano.

To wrap it up, John and Jay are Awesome, and I have no doubt that they will go above and beyond for you just as they did for us.  Please consider TOYOTA OF PLANO for your next car purchase, you will NOT be disappointed!

4557,"May 29, 2013","I had told an online representative I would make a 7.5 hour trip from South Texas to come and purchase a car I had seen online. The first thing the next day I received a call from Sunny Ati who advised me the car I was interested in had been sold and he did not want me to make the long trip and the car not be available. This was an incredible display of integrity. He could have allowed me to make the drive then when I arrived try to show me another car. I spoke to Sunny and asked him for his best price on a specific vehicle. He promised to call me back when he figured the price and he kept his promise. I was very pleasantly surprised that when I asked Sunny for his best price over the phone he truly gave me the best price. I had been working with a dealer back home in Corpus Christi, Tx. and had also been in contact with the Toyota dealer in Denton (we had purchased 2 vehicles from them several years ago). Sunny was never pushy, he answered my questions and offered information that he felt would interest and benefit me. Since I had done business with the Denton dealer in the past I stopped and spoke to them first when I got to town. I thought the price Sunny gave me was too good to be true but I was curious so we left the Denton dealer. The Denton sales manager told me to get the price in writing. When I got to Plano, Sunny brought up the car and when I asked for the price in writing he had no problem and returned a few minutes later with the price he had given me over the phone on the car I wanted. I gave the information about the vehicle and the price to the sales manager at the Denton dealership. He did some checking and told me if that was the vehicle I wanted I needed to buy it because it was ""an incredible deal"". He had checked with his general manager and could not match it. My dealer in Corpus could not give me their best price over the phone, but Sonny did. Sunny's display of integrity and sincere dedication to our complete satisfaction earned our business and respect. In an industry that has a history of being less than admirable regarding honesty and integrity it is comforting to know there are people like Sunny and a dealership like Toyota of Plano that truly earn and deserve our business. We can't wait until it's time to purchase another vehicle because we will be back and tell everyone we know if they buy from someone else they will pay too much. Sunny, we sincerely thank you and consider you a friend.  JLP",5.0

Having little luck finding a certified used Camry equipped as we wanted it, we decided on a new one.  We had several internet quotes from several dealerships in the area, but decided we preferred Toyota of Plano for it's location (within reasonable distance from our home in Murphy), and for the dealership's very high rating with Edmund's.  Our first internet quote from Gordon Young included several options we did not want, but decided to meet with him for a test drive.  After discussing our preferences with Gordon, we spent some time reviewing the available vehicles at Toyota of Plano meeting our needs (we didn't find an exact match.  Gordon was able to beat the best inernet pricing quotes I had received, and assured me he could find the car we wanted.  The very next day he found the car we wanted at another North Texas dealership, drove to the dealership and traded for the car we wanted.  We closed the deal that evening, and left the car with Gordon for installation of leather upholstery and window tinting.  We anticipate receiving the car early next week.  We were very pleased with Gordon.  He is knowledgeable, personable and low key.  There was no pressure, and he took whatever time we needed.  This is our first experience with Toyota of Plano, and thus far it has been very positive.  We are looking forward to a positive service relationship with them in the future.

Lucky for us a service advisor (Wes Armstrong) took ownership of this problem and after 
about an hour with the help of three technicians, the tech Bob reported to us that a spring
had disengaged and was now fixed. Not a good start with our new 2012 Camry. This was not Brian's
fault as the car had been ""Certified"", but that seems to be a loose concept.
At home we tried to program our garage door opener into the overhead panel, but after consulting the owner's manual
to look for three buttons on this panel, we could not find them. It seems that our
Camry 2012 XLE Limited Edition has NO programmable garage door buttons.

Once we started discussing numbers, both Alie and Rafael worked hard to keep the deal within terms I was comfortable with.  The process never became belligerent or combative.  When I went to sign the paperwork I met Ray and he was just as friendly as the other guys.

4615,"April 11, 2013","I came to this dealership with no intention of buying a new vehicle.  I mainly wanted to prove to a friend that I was not able to trade in my recently purchased used Chrysler Town & Country and get a new Toyota Sienna van.  However, I was proven wrong.  Our salesperson was Tariq Hussein who was quite knowledgeable about the van and its features.  Tariq is also very friendly and personable - not pushy at all which is what I liked about him.  My last experience was at Toyota of Dallas and it was not a very pleasant experience.    So, Tariq had his hands full since I just knew that he was on an impossible mission to sell this van.  We test drove the van.  Believe me Tariq has a lot of patience because I was so undecided on what to do but he gave me my space to think about it and in the end Tariq was able to answer any and all questions that I had so I sat down and begin filling out the paperwork.  
Rafael Amzayan then entered the picture and assured us that they would do their best to get us at the right payment amount that I was looking for and a great interest rate.  It took a lot of manuvering and back and forth but in the end Rafael came through with the lowest interest rate that I've ever had on a vehicle 3.39% (I believe) and the payment right where my current payment was at.  The deal was made!
I was next led back to meet with Ray Bellamine who made the signing of all the paperwork easy and went out of his way to get me a good deal on Gap insurance which I was at first not going to get.  The paperwork process was done with ease and Ray explained what each item was for as I signed them.
I can't say enough about what a great group of guys I had the pleasure of dealing with at Toyota of Plano.  Each one was friendly, honest and went of their way in getting this deal done.  I am quite impressed with them and have already recommended others who mentioned being interested in a new car to go to Toyota of Plano and see how easy buying a new vehicle can be.

I was interested in a car but was postponing considering a purchase until later this year. One day while my car was in service I walked over to the new car showroom to look around. David approached me and we had a nice conversation.

During our conversation he asked if I what I was driving and if I was considering another car. I acknowledged that I was but not until later in the year. David's easy going, customer focused professional style was appealing and I decided to consider moving up my plan.

I was interested in a car that was in limited supply, but David assured me that he could get the car. We moved ahead to discuss terms of a transaction and reached agreement quickly without the usual hassles of buying a car. I must commend Tim O'Grady for being very helpful in reaching an agreement on the terms.

The team went to work to find the car but was unsuccessful in trading out with other dealers so the car had to be ordered. I subsequently learned that David had ordered the car the day we signed the contact as a back up plan to the effort to trade out with other dealers. I was impressed and believe it significantly shortened the time to get the car.

David kept me informed of the progress on getting the car on a regular basis and the car arrived almost to the exact date that David had given me.

4635,"March 26, 2013","I accompanied a good friend of mine, Sherri Sneed, to the dealership, to help her buy a car.  Karen was our sales person.  She had initially contacted Sherri via email when Sherri inquired about a Prius.  Sherri wasn't sure if she was going to trade her 5 year Prius in when we walked in.  She was just thinking about it.  We had a bad experience at another dealer right before we got to Toyota of Plano.  We would have not had problem walking out of Toyota of Plano if we felt we were not treated well.  However, our experience was quite surprising.  Sherri made a deal that night.  Karen was probably the most professional and ethical sales person I have met.  She was also very patient and friendly, even though she had been there since early morning.  The gate to look at the cars in the back was locked and we had to go back and forth a few times, but we didn't mind at all (in my opinion - the gates should not be locked until the final customer is gone).  I don't usually like any car sales personnel, but immediately felt a rapport with Karen.  She saw things from our side, while explaining things from her viewpoint also. She worked with us to make a deal we were happy wtih.  We arrived at 8 pm and didn't leave there until after midnight.  We never felt rushed or pressured.

First he babbled about everything in a non-interactive manner and then rudely didn't offer an opportunity to go through my options and then had the audacity to tell me they have a lot of busy customers to whom they rather tend if i couldn't make up my mind. He was very rude and not genuine when he tried to have a personality. Get a better individual in the Finance Department, one who actually provides one on one attention rather than one who just blabs for 10 mins and start throwing figures in your face.",5.0

4673,"March 02, 2013","I can say without a doubt that my experience with Toyota of Plano was wonderful.  First, I was very relieved to just be able to drive around, get out of my car and look around without someone rushing up to me.  Over the years I have heard such negative feedback from people who would go car shopping and they stated it was an overwhelming un-enjoyable experience.  When I walked in to the sales office I was greeted with a smile and asked how could I be assisted?  I was asked to have a seat and they would have Sal help me this evening, offered my friend and I coffee while we sat.  Sal approached me with a smile, a handshake and introduced himself, he said he would be happy to help me this evening. He first asked how he could help me and then what questions could he answer.  There was no pressure.  As we sat down and I discussed my doubtfulness with Sal on possibly being able to purchase a new car he reassured me that they would review things very thoroughly.  After showing me several cars which appealed to me the paperwork was completed to see if it was a possibility.  I first visited with a man in financing whom honestly I did not care for.  Upon leaving that evening he not only made me feel pressured on money down but I left feeling a little low on myself.  The following week I received a call from Ken.  Ken offered me ""options"" to consider and asked if I would be interested in stopping back by to look at a few cars which may fit my budget better and make it easier for me to purchase with the exact amount down I wanted to pay.  I agreed and went that evening.  I was shown 2 cars which were both very nice.  When I made a choice (did not take long, my new car is beautiful) we sat down with John and Ken.  I firmly believe without Ken contacting me and approaching my hopeful purchase in a reasonable sense that I would not have my new car today.  He, without a doubt is exceptional at his job.  John was such a relief to work with, his professionalism and dedication is exactly how it should be.   All 3 of these gentlemen are excellent at what they do.

4691,"February 18, 2013","Let me start by saying the car I ended up buying at Toyota of Plano is exactly what I wanted, but the process getting there was VERY PAINFUL!!!!! I spent HOURS waiting for people to answer questions, fill out paper work and I was even told on TWO occasions they could NOT sell me the car I wanted. The only time satisfactory resolutions were made, is when I asked the GM and part owner Rusty to become involved. Otherwise the deal would have never happened. 
The lack of knowledge and interest on the part of sales associates and MANAGERS regarding programs for handicap individuals is astounding. There was no mention from ANYONE at Toyota of Plano regarding rebates of sales tax and/or Toyota rebates for handicap persons, even though I was VERY CLEAR I was buying the Sienna to accommodate a wheelchair and lift . 
The errors made on my paper work were numerous even OVERCHARGING me $2,000 at one point . The sales manager (Tim) confused me (not sure if this was intentional) by asking me to sign papers that were incorrect. When I pointed out the errors, he came back in the room with one correction and asked me to sign again. Then I pointed out the other errors AGAIN and he left the room and came back with a different change on the paper work. The multiple attempts and the time it took caused me to sign a deal overcharging me $2,000 which was only discovered AFTER I made out my check to Toyota. 
When the GM finally entered the deal - AT MY REQUEST (on 2 separate occasions) , he resolved everything, getting me the car I want at a good price, so he gets a GREAT rating. Other people I worked with there (about 7) were not good at their job. In fact, my original sales man (Halit) DUMPED me because I asked too many questions and he said it wasn't worth the $150 he was getting in commission. After I got the car home, I had some questions/problems which prompted me to call my newly assigned sales associate (John). On 1/31/13, he said it was the last day of the month and everyone was too busy to walk me through Bluetooth set up over the phone. When I pushed him further, he FINALLY helped me, which took LESS time than our conversation about NOT being able to help me. Then he left on vacation so he couldn’t answer further questions. Because he was on vacation, I called his boss (Lee) but had to leave messages (2) on his voice mail. To this day, he has still NEVER CALLED ME BACK. Many of my questions were answered by the national customer service department of Toyota rather than the Toyota of  Plano dealership. 
ONE MAJOR PROBLEM THAT STILL EXISTS.....I STILL DO NOT HAVE MY HANDICAP LICENSE PLATES, BECAUSE THE PERSON WHO CLOSED THE DEAL (JAY) LOST THE ORIGINAL DOCTOR'S FORM  I GAVE HIM SAYING I WAS HANDICAPPED.  TOYOTA OF PLANO TOLD ME TO GET ANOTHER FORM SIGNED, WHICH COST ME A DOCTOR'S VISIT CHARGE AND A LOT OF PAIN GETTING TO THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE.  TOYOTA OF PLANO WANTED ME TO BRING THEM THE NEW FORM, BUT SINCE I HAVE AN HOUR TRIP TO THE DEALERSHIP, I ASKED THEM TO PICK IT UP (ONLY FAIR SINCE THEY LOST THE FORM IN THE FIRST PLACE).  BUT TAMARA (CUSTOMER SERVICE MANAGER) TOLD ME ""THEY DID NOT DO THAT"" AND I WAS TOLD TO MAIL THE FORM.  NOW THEY STILL DON'T HAVE IT (I BELIEVE THEY LOST IT AGAIN) AND EXPECT ME TO GET MY DOCTOR TO SIGN A THIRD FORM (WHICH HE DOES NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE DOING).  I DON'T KNOW HOW OR WHEN I AM EVER GOING TO GET LICENSE PLATES FOR MY NEW TOYOTA.  THIS ADDITIONAL STRESS IS NOT GOOD FOR MY CONDITION!!!!!  I hope this kind of treatment doesn't spill over into the service department, or I am going to regret my choice of Toyota of Plano for many years to come.
There are a lot of Toyota dealers in the metroplex and I suggest to all those reading this review, if you care about how you are treated, buy somewhere other than Toyota of Plano. Or deal ONLY with the GM Rusty Gentry who was the only person interested enough to resolve some of my issues (I hope he steps in and resolves the license plate problem soon.)

I had an extremely positive experience with this gentleman and the dealership. Everything was handled with precision and professionalism. It is not often that you as a consumer may dread the experience of getting a new car. This was not the case for me this time. I actually enjoyed the experience, made new friends and am delighted with my new vehicle. Everyone seemed to come together as a team to get me an ""emergency"" cash distribution I needed for a personal matter and they handed me a check, as promised and without delay. You can tell that there is a comrade between upper and lower management. On a scale of 1-10. I would give my experience an 11. The dealership is very well located to me and that also is a plus.The finance team was terrific in going over all details and was able to answer any question I had. They made the process very quick - from start to finish I turned in a used car and drove out with a brand new one in less that 2 hours. I've been driving from 46 years and I can't recall a more positive experience that this. The car handles very well, is very sporty and I've received a number of complements about it. So I'm pleased with the product and the driving experience - especially it's ability to interface with my iPhone. Terrific sound system by the way.

Mentioned this to the service advisor and he said something about different oil pans, etc.  They also put in the wrong grade of oil.  Toyota specifies 0w-20 or 5w-20.  They used 5w-30.  This is not the first time either of these has happened.  The 7 quart issue has come up almost every time and in the past they have changed it to 5 quarts.  Not this time.

We went through the USAA Car Buying Service, input what we were looking for and shortly thereafter received a phone call from the most amazing and friendly salesperson Karen Schlatterer.  Karen worked with us over the phone and through email to help us find exactly what we were looking for.  As a result of Karen's hard work, we were able to walk into the dealership this past Saturday and purchase our brand new Toyota Rav 4 in less than a 2 hour timeframe.

4746,"December 02, 2012","Overall I don't like buying cars, becuase most delearships have their wasteful ineffiicient sales process, where they end up spending hours trying to upsell on every part of the deal.   I typically layout how I would like the process to go, and most dealerships ignore  my request and proceed with their  process.  However I had a very good experience, with Toyota Plano.    

I was looking to buy a camry or accord.    I liked both cars.   I knew exactly what model/options/colors I wanted.   First Toyota dealer gave me a price indication over the internet, but once they presented me an offer at the delearship, I discovered I was only eligible for the internet quote, if I was military and recent college grad / and current toyota owner etc.....   While I view this as a bait and switch strategy, I did like the sales guy was still open to purchasing from them.    Ironically while I was in the first Toyota dealership, Toyota Plano had sent me a follow-up information because I had made a price request from them a previously.     So I decided to get a quote from them also.    With-in 10 minutes of talking to Toyota Plano over the phone, they had an offer that was just a tad lower than the first Toyota dealer.  It had taken me 60 minutes to negotiate this deal at the first Toyota dealer.  I never told Toyota Plano the actual price from the other Toyota dealership.     The Honda dealership never did give me a good price, so I choose Toyota Plano.

I went in(without ever being there before) and left in less  90 minutes with a brand new camry(and 0 % financing).   There was no high pressured up selling, or 30 minute conversations with accessory lady(like there was with last Honda I purchases).  Just a quick, effective transaction.

It was smooth sale from the time I entered and time we signed on the dotted line. Short and sweet. No pushing no manipulation. Simple and honest. I have to say that John is one of the most forthcoming and professional in his business. It was probably his attitude that made me buy the car.  He delivered what he promised me over the phone conversation I had with him prior to coming to the dealership.  I absolutely send more business to him in near future.

Service manager was rude and confrontational.  Wouldn't introduce himself properly or even give me his name.  Service people seemed uninformed and inept.  Routinely could not identify problems in advance, find the right replacement parts, and leave you waiting all day at the dealership before telling you to come back tomorrow.

What really gets me, is this is the dealership where I originally purchase my car.  You would think that customer service to their own customers would be important to them.

The sales person (Carlos Lazo)was super friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable. He introduced himself as soon as we walked in. And he was so very nice (I have found that this is not always the case at other dealerships, but that is another story). He went out of his way to show us all of the cars that were available. I was there to buy a Prius. And he (very happily and with great enthusiasum) showed me all that were available. He went over the milage on each one and showed me the difference between the model years. He clearly enjoys his job and that made it a pleasant experience. And many people may feel the way that I do, that the car buying process is not usually something to look forward to; most of us kind of dread doing it. But this was a different experience. It was pleasant and pretty darn fast too. 

And the finance person(John Donawho) took it from being a good experience, to being a great experience. He went to great lengths to explain the financing process and how he could go about it. He looked at every option available to me, to get me as close to the 'target' monthly payment I wanted to stick to. He even offerred me some creative financing options that I had not heard of. I learned a lot and was interested in considering every option; which I did. I am so impressed with the professionalism and customer service that are provided at Toyota of Plano, that I am not sure that I can begin to put it into words.

I wasn't seriously looking for a vehicle, but my daughter wanted to stop by. The salesman was so kind to my daughter and I. At that moment I knew when I was actually ready to purchase I would go to Toyota of Plano. A couple of days ago, I knew I was ready to buy, but I couldn't remember the sales person's name that helped me last time so I just went online and chatted with a representative and told him what kind of car I was looking for and gave him my contact information. He told me that he would forward my information to a sales person and someone would contact me. As promised Jacoub Oueini called, and I setup an appointment to meet with him that same evening. I arrived at the dealership and met Jacoub and realized that he was the same friendly sales person that I met a year prior! I didn't reveal that to him intially, but he was giving me the same thorough and kind service as before so I just had to say something. As I began to tell him the story, he remembered my daughter and I coming to the dealership! I was upfront with Jacoub and told him my situation and that it may not be easy to get me financed, but that DID NOT stop Jacoub. He was on Team Tamara from that moment forward! I picked out a Camry and filled out the paperwork.

We negotiated the entire deal over the phone for our new 4Runner without having to actually go to the dealership...a bonus for us, as there is nothing worse than taking three small children to a car dealership for the ""traditional"" negotiation tactics employed by so many other dealerships.

The only problem we encountered was the condition of the vehicle when we went to pick it up.  It wasn't filled with fuel, wasn't detailed, there were parts missing from the vehicle and they damaged the tailight when they took the pinstripe off the vehicle(who puts wants pinstripes anymore...really???)

Without the need for high pressure, I got such a great offer that I signed that day.

They first low-balled me on my trade-in value (pretty typical though), kept me at the dealership for 4+ hours (again, typical I know), then once I was about to sign for the car, I double and triple checked that there were more than 1 key for the car. I was told yes, multiple times. And what do you know? There was only one key for the car. I was, however, told that I could contact the previous owner, and get the second key myself. I didn't know that was the customer's job. They had no date when the oil was changed, and they claimed they had changed it, which I found out later was incorrect. They weren't able to calculate the taxes for my purchase correctly, and claimed I owed them $500 more dollars AFTER the contract was signed. I contacted my attorney promptly, and was told I did not owe the dealership anything. Now, it's been two plus months after I bought the car, and I still somehow don't have my tag because the dealership has taken a month to get my VIN Inspection to an 'outside titling company,' which was supposed to send all the information to my nearest Tag Agency for prompt delivery of my tag and title.

4886,"August 03, 2010","I usually donot write reviews but I visited Toyota of plano twice despite seeing and hearing bad reviews about this dealership. and found exaclty that they are the biggeest cheats. so wanted to put in a word and spare other some time by avoiding this dealership. these guys donot remotely understand the meaning of customer satisfaction and on top of that play games with the customers. they will show some random customer to you and tell you that the other customer is here for the same car as you to put pressure. the service is disgusting and they are very rude with the customers. have seen the director there called kia petterson , he is the worst sales manager one can ever interact with.. beware of these guys.. afterall all these bad reviews about them do convey something . i learnt it the hard way. but happy that i didn;t buy a car from them otherwise i donot know how there aftersales service would have been",1.0
4887,"July 11, 2010","Be prepared for the sterotypical horrible buying experience.  Great talk in the beginning.  Then you get the back and forth to the sales mgr..down to asking for $50 more!  If the car had not been just what I wanted, I would have walked out 10 minutes into the negotiation.  Salesman was a jerk. Once the deal was struck, he couldn't wait to get you out.  Delivery was a sham.    Exactly what everyone thinks the car buying experience is like. Have bought many cars...this was the second worst experience in 50 years. One exception, the business office (contract man) was excellent.  The only part of the day that went well.  Stay away from this place, even if it costs you a little more.  Can't imagine what the service department must be like!",2.3
4888,"February 05, 2010","My experience with Toyota of Plano exceeded any/all expectations.  Evan was extremely helpful, kept me up-to-date on the status of my vehicle and did not try to ""pressure sell"" me into anything I didn't need.  I will go back the next time I need service.",5.0
4889,"January 01, 2010","I went to the dealership on 12-26-09 and put a deposit on a rav 4 and david guarantee the vehicle in 7-10 days. I told david i needed the vehicle before 12-31-09 for the tax credit, he stated no problem. I get a phone call in the afternoon on 12-30-09 we can not get the vehicle. his answer we could not get the car from dealer. No explaination or apology. I also phoned him everyday for follow up, would not return phone calls. HONESTY AND COMMUNICATIONS IS THE BEST POLICY, THERE IS NONE. PLEASE DO NOT BUY FROM THIS DEALER IF THIS IS HOW THEY TREAT THERE CUSTOMERS. ",1.4
4890,"December 05, 2009","My Toyota Guy, Fazali Imam, went above and beyond the call to put me in a new Toyota.  I had a budget and limited income and he did exactly as I asked and he was not pushy at all like some car salesmen.  The finance guy was also equally as great.  I was invited to a new car orientation which was very informative and was introduced to all managers who answered all questions asked, no matter how trivial.  The entire staff at this dealership was awsome.  I have not bought a new car in a very long time and was leary about the experience with pushy salesmen.  I could not have been more wrong about this dealership.  I would highly recommend this dealership and My Toyota Guy to anyone.  I am totally satisfied.",5.0
4891,"November 22, 2009","I was very pleased with my experience at this dealership and with my salesman, Faz.  I initially inquired about a Camry over the internet, got exactly the information I wanted by email, and wrapped up the transaction quickly and smoothly the next day.    ",5.0
4892,"December 13, 2008","Went in to buy a new car.  Told the sales person that I wanted to spend no more than 17 grand.  He said ""no problem""  then showed me a car that was 18000.  I explained to him that I could not afford more than 17.  He said ""i can fix this, but, do you like it?""  Basic model, power windows/locks was the only ""perk"".  Went to ""haggle"" the price.  He said ""I am going to take care of you"".  Went to talk to the ""finance"" guy...though I dont know why-I already had financing.  Was told that He was the one that would be taking care of signing.  After sitting for an HOUR waiting for him, I was escorted into his office.  He then explained that my credit was ""not so good, it is actually pretty low"" that 18% was the lowest he could offer me.  I WAS APPALED!!!  NOt only was I embarrassed but if I had not known what my credit score was going in I would have either taken his offer or left with out the car.  I informed him that I already had finincing and that he could take his offer and shove it up his ass.  He got irritated and asked me who my financing was through, asked for the number, and CALLED MY BANK TO FIND OUT WHAT RATE THEY HAD GIVEN ME!!!!  (I have to admit that i was a little smug when he got a hold of my mom -who works for a bank and is my loan officer and she chewed his ass when he asked questions that were none of his business!)  When I got back to the salesmans desk to ""sign the papers"" I realized that I was being sold the car FOR STICKER!!!!  When I asked my salesman why he acted as if we had never had the conversation about ""I can not pay more than 17"".  I left the dealership and have never gone back.  I wasted 4 hours in that place.  I will never go back.",1.4
4893,"January 05, 2008","Do not buy extended warranty from Toyota of plano.  They do not honor the warranty.  I took my car for a problem with the brake light and the stalling that happens when I steer the car to the left.  They diagoned the problem as a piece of hardware ( costing 1400) to replace that should have been covered with the extended warranty.  But Toyota of plano refused to cover.  The car only had 50K mileage and the warranty was for 100K.

4894,"July 21, 2004","My initial sales experience was okay.  I was in touch with the internet sales manager prior to arrival to the dealership.  He quoted me a price ($500 over invoice) and so I went in to test drive a 4Runner.  When we went to negotiate the deal, the ""sales manager"" only took $1000 off (which was the current incentive) the sticker price.  I told the sales guy that I wasn't paying that much since I was quoted something much lower.  He promptly went back and fixed the ""problem.""  I got the window tinting (priced at $199 for 2 windows), which I had to bring my car back for on another day.  This is where my trouble began...Trip #1:  My windows got tinted, but there was a piece of lint in the driver's side window, and bubbles in the passenger's window.  Brought it back for them to redo...Trip #2:  Bubbles in the driver's side window.  Then upon closer inspection, there were cuts and scratches all over my car (8 in. scratch on front bumper, small scratches on front fender, scratches on window and seal around window, big black scratch on rear bumper).  So basically my car was vandalized while it was sitting at the dealership.  Complained to service guy and GM (never heard back though).  Dealership offered to fix.Trip #3:  Fixed front bumper/fender and replaced tinting.  Rear bumper still needed some work to smooth out the paint (you can tell where they had painted).  Crew scratched up the frame around the driver's side window while they were fixing the scratches on it (go figure).  New scrapes on tint.  New cut on rubber seal at bottom of driver's side window.  Got explanation that the dealership didn't have an enclosed area to do tinting, so some bubbles may occur (and why wasn't I told this when I was offered the tinting service??).Trip #4:  Was finally offered a rental car (a new 2004 Camry) for my troubles.  Supposed to be fixing rear bumper, tinting, frame, and rubber seal around window.  They're supposed to be sending the car down to the professional tinting place down the street.  We'll see what happens.  That was this morning.So I bought my car on 6/15, and it has already been in the shop for various things 4 times in a little over a month.  It's pretty irritating.  Hopefully they'll fix it right this time.  I guess my advice is to just buy the car as is and don't let them do any add-ons (unless it's to install lo-jack or something simple).  They obviously can't do it right there.The only redeeming factor is that I got a VIP card in the mail that allows me to get free oil changes for the life of the factory warranty (3 years, 36k miles).  That was a nice perk.",2.3
