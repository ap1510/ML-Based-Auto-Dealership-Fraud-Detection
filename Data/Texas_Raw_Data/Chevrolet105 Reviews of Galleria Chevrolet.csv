The service manager won’t even get back in touch with the original dealership. (I live out of state and had to make a special trip to get my truck!,2.0
1,"June 22, 2020",I brought in my 20002 Chevy Intrigue for service and they did a great job. Jason was a big help walking me through the process and keeping me updated. Parts had to be obtained from several far flung locations due to the age of my vehicle. I appreciate all of the hard work to get my car in shape. I have an even older Intrigue (1998) and will be bringing it in very soon to have it looked at. Happy to work with Jason and Galleria Chevrolet again.,5.0

5,"June 10, 2020","I had the most horrible experience with Paul the manager in sales for new cars after 3 hours of dealing for a purchase and game playing , this unfit car dealer, was rude and came at me like a bully to announce he would not sell the car~ Poor customer service. This guy has to learn to smile and be courteous ~ I really advise to go somewhere else to buy your car do not lose your time and money there! But Ali, the intermediary salesman was a delight. He was very polite, respectful, and Jovial. He was trying very hard to sell us a car at a reasonable price for us. He would have succeeded if Paul, with a disgusting attitude didn't ruin it.",1.0

10,"May 16, 2020","I have NEVER experienced such dishonesty in my life! I went in because they had a 2019 Acadia that was priced great! I think they had accidentally mis-priced it, and wouldn't admit it to me. So, they obviously decided they would get my money somehow!! I told the salesman that I decided that I would buy it, and told them that I would be putting 2k down. 

The next day, I was supposed to show up and sign the paperwork and told the salesman that I had gotten pre-approved financing through a credit union. He then proceeded to tell me that they would only sell me the car if I financed through GM Financial. Needless to say, I was LIVID!! No dealership can tell you who you can finance with. I had a 2.7% APR from the Credit Union. They couldn't even come close to that with GM Financial. I told him (and his ""manager"") what I thought of them. 

Two hours later, I had purchased a beautiful 2018 Silver Acadia with 2.39% from another dealership (GMC). (I have Excellent credit, so don't expect they could get you anything quite that low.) They had found that APR because of their relationship with Capital One!! So I saved even more!!

21,"June 10, 2019","We purchased a Certified vehicle at Clay Cooley Chevrolet Galleria in April 2019. The finance lady, Esmeralda Garcia, told us about an additional coverage that would extend the warranty for 48k additional miles. This additional coverage would also cover wheels and tires - especially if we had an accidental blowout. It sounded great specially since we have a newborn. After going over the coverage again to make sure what she was saying was true we declined. She then said, what if I can give you that coverage at a lower cost - only raising your monthly payment a little more. It made sense and we agreed.

Now that we had a flat on the highway it turns out that the coverage was not written into our contract. The piece of paper that she used to hand write what it covered was also not included in all the paperwork she gave us. Since we cannot prove the conversation Clay Cooley Chevrolet Galleria seems it as it did not happen. Yet we were clearly charged for it, but it's our word versus an employee that no longer works there. Guess who wins?

It's ridiculous! In a world where you are suppose to trust a company that is selling you something based on what you are being told - we were sold a false promise. It's not the tire itself it is the lack of responsibility from Clay Cooley Chevrolet Galleria. Little to being called a liar is unacceptable. It almost seemed like a situation like this had come up before based on my call being passed around. 

So if you are in the market for a car please think twice about going to Clay Cooley Chevrolet Galleria. They'll sale you something and then claim it never happened.",1.0

27,"April 18, 2019","Don't come here unless you want your credit threatened.  After shopping here, two days later the F & I Manager called and tried to intimidate us by saying “I’d hate to have to make these inquiries on your credit” implying he was going to attack our credit and cause a drop in our score. Essentially, he was attempting to BLACKMAIL us into coming back to buy a car.

29,"November 27, 2018","I've always bought used cars privately.  I thought there were benefits to buying a newer used car from a dealer, so took the step.  Not only have I had terrible experiences with working with the dealer, but I've asked no less than 10 times to get off of their call list. 

They call me almost weekly to tell me they want to buy the car I purchased from them.  They couldn't even tell me what car it was most of the time.  I've begged and pleaded to get off their call list.

I would not recommend this company or the people that work there. ",1.4
30,"September 17, 2018","I recommend NOT working with this dealership or any Clay Cooley dealerships. Customer service is horrible and they have no respect for customers, especially women. I worked with Sales Manager Matt, at first he seemed to be very helpful; however that changed the moment I decided the car deal offered was not the best for me, he was very disrespectful. I have small children and would prefer a car with dark interior. I started the paperwork on the new car with a lite interior and last minute thought I should shop around to for what would best fit my family's needs. With already making the down payment, I notified the dealership that I would not be moving forward with signing the paperwork. I then asked if they could process my refund for the down payment. I was told no, ""our policy is to only process refunds on business days"". That did not sound right to me, so I asked for a copy of the policy, in which they could not provide. I asked once more if the refund could be processed and I was told ""no you have to come back on Monday because it is after business hours"". My response was ""that is strange because you process the down payment after business hours, yet you cannot process the refund until business hours?"" I asked once more, if the refund could be processed and the response was ""just get someone in finance to take care of her, because she is ridiculous"". The General Manager and Assistant General Manager were standing near, witnessed and heard the entire conversation, including the policy lies and derogatory comments, yet they never once said anything. After leaving in tears, I received a very rude text message from the Sales Manager Matt the next day that stating ""you are colded blooded for not taking the car deal...that made me look like a fool to my company, do not call me to help you with a car ever again"" (see image below). Not to mention the car, a 2018 Chevrolet Malibu, would not start when we tried to take it for a test drive. I had to go get jumper cables to give battery jump from the car I was trading in, just to get the ""new"" car started.",1.0
31,"August 02, 2018","I am extremely disappointed in the treatment and unprofessionalism that was displayed by this establishment. Spent 2 days here, promised a price, and was a switch and bait, especially when they realize you aren't financing through them. After speaking with the manager, Jeff, who didn't want to rectify the situation but just did not want me to write a ""negative review"". From management, to the salesman very shady establishment.  Overall, this experience has been horrific, and business was handled poorly. From other reviews, it's sad to see that management continues let consumers be treated in this matter, not having the best interest of the customer. I would avoid this place at all costs, go somewhere that actually values your time and business.",1.4
32,"July 06, 2018","Worst experience I have ever had trying to buy a vehicle!!!!! Very inexperienced staff very unprofessional. Manager (Chance Cooley) was an absolute joke !!!!! Let me and my husband walk out of the dealership extremely unhappy and never even offered to make things right. Had other salesman from Desoto and Irving locations contact me wanting go to sell me the vehicle at there  location, which I was very interested in doing so. But because Chance was behaving very childish and incredibly unprofessional he would rather lose a sale than do the right thing.  Chance called and told me that he would deal with me directly but that that vehicle was not going to be sold except out of his location, said he would get me some numbers and get back with me. He never did had a salesman from the Irving store call me and he had raised the price 8,000. Price gouging is illegal!!!!!We had even cleaned out my vehicle that we where trading in and when we were trying to get the trash out the salesman JT said leave the trash “my Mexicans will clean it out”. Could not believe what he had said!!!!! It’s really bad when one of the employees reach out to me because they had heard and seen what had taken place when we were there on Saturday and they tried to get another more experienced salesman to help us with purchasing the vehicle from another location, and again when the other salesman would call and try to get the vehicle they were all told that the vehicle sold, when in fact it is still very much available!!!!! Poor business move Chance Cooley!!!! Save yourself time and please go to another dealership this place is the biggest circus I have ever seen!!!! Really hate that this was such a horrible experience I probably would have done  business there in desoto from now on because the location is so convenient., oh well your loss!!! Grow up Chance Cooley you got a lot to learn in life on how to run a business!!!!!!!!! Pitiful ",1.0
33,"June 08, 2018","Most horrible car buying experience I have ever been a part of. I bought my son a car from here and thought I got a pretty good deal, only to have the dealership call me days later to say Cap One backed out on the loan. When I called Cap One to determine the issue they said congrats your loan went thru this morning. After confronting the dealership with this information they continued to lie and make it seem like it was my fault that the deal didn’t happen and said Cap One denied the deal. After pressing more people for answers it came out that they priced the car too low by mistake and didn’t want to take the loss. So break my sons heart because of your mistake? This is exactly what they did. They got all gangsta on us saying we couldn’t leave with the car, but tried to sell us on some other piece of junk. Long story made short, they lied to me from the beginning by listing the car at $7,100 online only to jump it to $9,200 in person, then we settled on $8,100 but when I signed the paperwork it said $8,200. That was just the beginning of the lies. I have never been told so many lies in 1 hour. After I exposed them for lying about Cap One backing out they finally said we reserve the right to refuse the sale of the car if we want to. In my opinion they should have let my son keep it. If I ever get my down payment back I will use it to hire protesters to stand at the dealership and let people know to beware of dealing with these guys.",1.4

36,"January 10, 2018","First of all, my service advisor was Ms. Lack-a-Brain Jennifer Urzua. I have never worked with someone who was so unprofessional and incapable of doing a simple job. 

I had my car towed in on Dec 27th and gave them simple instructions to look at my battery and alternator. According to them, a rodent had chewed my cable that connects to my battery and I needed a new engine.  Like any other time that I leave my car at Chevy to be looked at, I was given a loaner car. I filed a claim through my insurance to go inspect the cable since they would be covering the cost.--Keep in mind that it is also NYE weekend and a lot of companies are closed for the holidays/weekends--so the next day (Friday) I informed Jennifer that my insurance company will be out within 24-48 business hours to inspect my car. She emailed me and said they would begin charging me for my rental since my insurance company hasn't been out yet. Okay, no big deal. I returned the rental within 30 minutes of receiving the email to avoid extra charges and proceeded with another rental from my insurance company. 

The following Tuesday or Wednesday my insurance company came to inspect the car and left them with an estimate and instructions to begin working on the car. Saturday…Jennifer called me asking what they were supposed to be doing to my car. I acknowledged the fact that I was aware that my insurance company had already instructed them to do the work on my car and she insisted that they did not. She then told me that the cord was not the issue with my car and that the engine was the problem, but she wasn't going to call the warranty company because SHE  didn't THINK they would cover it. Stupid.  About 5 minutes later, she called and said that they were closing out my ticket because they don't feel like dealing with my insurance & warranty company and to pick up my car or they will start charging storage fees starting the following day. As my insurance company advised, because they also agreed that Chevy was NOT doing their job, I had my insurance company tow it to a different  location. Ket (service director) tried to charge me for a rental and diagnostic fee. I was willing to pay the diagnostic fee, but not the rental because I was not told from the beginning that I was being charged for it. He rudely tried to negotiate with me on the phone. Eventually, I was, unfortunately, directed back to Jennifer where I constantly brought up her emails after she tried to change her statements on the phone. She was constantly trying to change the subject on me and not directly answer my questions because she knew she was WRONG. We were willing to pay the simple price of the diagnostic fee; however, her and her boss insisted we were trying to get over on them. Eventually, Ket agreed to (after 2 weeks of NOTHING) let me come pick up my car with no fees attached and take it elsewhere. I wouldn’t even send my worst enemy here.  I will NEVER go here or any other Chevy dealership again!

37,"December 14, 2017","As a young, single Mom buying a car can be nerve wracking. I recently bought what I thought was a good car from another, non reputable dealership. After a week of getting the run around I called my local certified chevy dealership to see If they could help by pointing me in the direction (I had no idea how warranties worked or why my car had so many problems so quickly). To my surprise they said that I could bring the vehicle to them and they would look everything over for me, no questions asked. They promised to get me back on the road in time to pick my son up from out of town, even offering to get me into a rental car if needed. When I arrived at the dealership I received the best treatment imaginable. After inspecting my car it was found to have a branded title, the wrong sized battery and countless other issues. I was so lucky that they took the time to inspect and explain everything to me the way that they did. Because of their kindness and patience I was able to return that piece of junk before it was too late. I'm getting my new car from them today and couldn't be happier. It's nice to know that good people and trustworthy businesses do still exist.",5.0

41,"June 06, 2017","A few weeks ago I found a modestly priced vehicle online that I wanted to check out, I contacted the dealership, it was at a different Clay Cooley location.  I was contacted by a salesperson about the car and asked to come to this location to test drive the vehicle. I agreed and made an appointment. I emailed my contact at the dealership to ensure that the vehicle I was interested in would be at the location I was going to (Chevrolet Galleria).  They assured me that it would and they'd have it cleaned up and ready to go.  Just to be safe I called again just before leaving to make sure it was there.  They assured me it was.  It wasn't there.  I said I still wanted to see it and the sales person asked if my girlfriend and I wanted to go with her to the other location to look at it (40 minutes away and leaving my car at the galleria location).  I said no, I'd rather that they go get it as I was assured multiple times that it would be there.  In the mean time I asked to see any similar vehicles that were on the property.  I was shown one vehicle that I was not interested in and it  was $10,000 more than the one I had requested to test drive.  After waiting for a very long time and being shown no additional vehicles, my salesperson finally left to go get the vehicle from the other location.  While waiting the hour and a half for her to return I requested to be shown other cars on two separate occasions.  Both times I was told someone would be with me shortly.  Both times no one showed up and I was never shown any other cars.  When the vehicle I was interested in finally arrived, it was in less that satisfactory condition (a lot of rust for a 2 year old vehicle) and hadn't even been cleaned.  It was a pickup truck and the flat bed had a very noticeable layer of dirt in it.  It was as though the car had just been parked in a back lot somewhere for quite some time.  I expressed my concern about the amount of rust on the vehicle and under the hood and the employees at the dealership kept insisting it was fine and safe and tried to get me to drive off with the car for a few days to see if I liked it.  I continued saying no because I didn't want to have to deal with driving it back to their dealership or anything when I already knew I wasn't satisfied with its condition.  I asked that they take the vehicle to Toyota (it was a Toyota Tacoma) and have them do a presale inspection and I asked that that information be sent to me before I would agree to paying the amount they priced the vehicle at.  They agreed.  This never happened.  I texted my contact the following Monday for an update and was told that the car had been inspected by Toyota and required $350 dollars worth of repairs.  I asked the for the report I had requested and did not receive it.  I continued requesting this report for several days to no avail.  I called the dealership and asked to speak to the direct supervisor of the person I had been speaking to about the car.  He told me he would get me the requested report in 5 minutes.  10 minutes later my contact texted me (after not responding for several days) saying that she had sent the car back to the original Clay Cooley dealership with the information I wanted inside and that she would track it down.  I asked later that day and the next morning if there was any update on the situation.  There was not.  I gave up. The day before yesterday I received a text message from the dealership asking me to come in again and also questioning why they didn't earn my business and what they could do to rectify that.  I responded to the text message expressing my dissatisfaction and I included my email address in case someone finally felt like addressing any of the issues I mentioned above.  No response.  In short, if I could give this dealership 0 stars I would.  Absolutely no person who worked for or with this dealership was of any assistance whatsoever excepting maybe the nice receptionist who let me have a bottle of water while waiting for the truck to arrive.  I felt disrespected, overlooked and entirely baffled not only by the ability of the dealership and its employees to waste MY time but also their own.  If anyone from Clay Cooley reads this and doesn't agree or believes this is hyperbole I have the emails, text chains and names to back this up. ",1.2
42,"April 01, 2017","Based on my experience (shop there on March 30 and 31), this dealership is not even worth stopping by. I strongly recommend that you stay away from them. The finance team will try to wear you down and will defenitely lie to you. I went there to look for a Chevy Tahoe. The sales man called Aundre was nice, patien and correct. However, when the finance team came to scene all went really bad. basically they are not honest and the whole proccess lacks of minimum levels of ethics and transparency. I got a reasonable discount but then they tried to rip me off with the finance. They do not like a NO for answer so they promise to meet my requirements and when the deal was just about to get closed and signed (after using many triks to make us waste time and to wear us down) they say they can't do it, retracting all they had said was to going to happen. Their tactic consists of trying hard to make you give up at the very last moment and sign. Lack of a minimum consideration and sensibility towards the costumer. It is a waste of time.",1.0

44,"February 06, 2014","Last week I purchased a new 2014 Suburban from AutoNation.  After several visits, test drives, and negotiations at one of the largest Chevrolet dealers in town, I had arrived at what I considered a ""good deal"".  Prior to leaving work to finalize that deal, I called AutoNation to test their ""best deal"" to compare to the deal I was about to enter into.  AutoNation had a better equipped vehicle on which they substantially discounted to earn my business, done quickly, over the phone, and signed up in about 3 hours start to finish.  As a result, I saved roughly 10% or about $5k over the other deal going to AutoNation.  In addition, they found financing for me at a better rate than I had gotten from a credit union I had joined just for that purpose.  The credit union I had joined was listed in the Dallas Morning News that week as having the best car loan rates.  In short, AutoNation Galleria Chevrolet worked quickly, didn't waste my time, had the perfect vehicle--actually more than I was willing to pay for, yet sold it to me for far less than the other dealer I had worked with on a lesser equipped vehicle, and then found me great financing.  

A very friendly atmosphere (as you would expect), but I have been in dealerships where people not involved in making a sale would more or less ignore you.  This place seemed as if everyone genuinely liked their jobs and where they worked as everyone seemed genuinely friendly and engaging.   This was true after the sale.  I brought my wife along to pick up the vehicle the following day.  The saleman took all the time my wife and I needed to go through the truck and learn the operation of the vehicle and all the electronics which was new to us.  We even went on a post-sale test ride so he could be sure my wife liked the vehicle.  It was a reasonably busy Saturday for him.  Yet he took all time in the most relaxed way to see that my wife and I were comfortable with the SUV while I was more concerned that he get back to making a living.   

Great deal, great financing, relaxed atmosphere but moved as quickly as I wanted, didn't waste my time, relatively painless experience (I generally hate buying a car), nice people.  Highly recommended.

45,"July 11, 2013","Russell Gray and all the Auto Nation staff are very courteous, professional, knowledgeable and genuine.  They made sure the car I was purchasing was exactly what I was looking for. The selling price quoted beat all other competitors, and was definitely worth the three and a half hour drive.  It was the best new car buying experience, with no pressure to buy.  Awesome dealership.  VERY, VERY SATISFIED!!

46,"February 02, 2013","From the moment I first called this dealership, I felt welcomed warmly and genuinely. By now I've visited the Bankston showroom numerous times, with questions and curiosity about the vehicle (the Volt) I was researching (and have bought as of this past week).  Each time, I was welcomed by someone either before or as I steppped in the door of the showroom.  These folks work together and even when they knew that Joe would be my salesman, they were all friendly and kind.  I have the most superlative praise for them all and especially for Joe, who has been and continues to be extremely patient in all the choices that go with buying a new car -- including what to me is the very crucial difference between the colors jet black and charcoal.  Joe owns a Volt himself, and he has become a sort of mentor in explaining to me the fine points of owning and enjoying the car. Patrick has been very great in accompanying me on 2 test drives and following up over the phone in a kind and helpful and never manipulative manner.  Mike helps with the sales paperwork process and is patient in explaining and disclosing the fine points.  I was introduced to Tyrall, in the service area; he's been with Bankston for 10 years and seems very sincere and devoted to his work.  I am delighted with my new Volt, with the whole process at Bankston, and with the prospect of continuing over the years to have Bankston as the place I'll bring my car for care & maintenance. The service area waiting room looks very nice, evidently that and the whole showroom building have been recently renovated, so the ambiance is very nice, too. ",5.0

48,"January 15, 2013",i really enjoyed my experience with purchasing a new truck with gina church. i have been told that i am not the easiest person to deal with when it comes to buying vehicles. however gina made my experience the best i have ever had. she was very professional and sweet. she gave me the price i wanted up front with no games.  i will definitely refer her and use her again when buying my next truck no matter what dealership she is located. ,5.0
49,"January 07, 2013","As with most sales establishments, I expect nothing when I walk in the door or call on the phone. I went to Bankston Chevy with this mindset. 

I call ahead, as I usually do, to schedule an appointment, and was routed to Gina. She seemed very nice on the phone, and as we chatted, her impartial professionalism and motherly kindness struck me as unusual yet desirable qualities in a salesperson. I immediately knew she was going to take care of my mother and me as well as give us the best deal she could. I was definitely looking forward to potentially doing business with her.
When my mother and I arrived at Bankston, we were greeted with smiles as I asked for Gina, who was quite glad to see me. She took care of my mother and me while simultaneously training new salesmen (Cade and JT).

As far as numbers go, this was the third dealership I had called, and the second one to answer the phone. I chose Bankston for the people more than the price. However, the price my mother was given for her new vehicle was about $2000 less than the competition. The vehicle given by Bankston was also exactly what she needed, something that the other dealership simply could not give.

In short, my mother and I made a new friend in Gina, Cade and JT, as well as became potential lifetime customers of Bankston Chevrolet (depending on proximity, of course). I would highly recommend this dealership to anyone who would like to purchase a Chevy or Nissan in the Greater Dallas area.",5.0

I emailed payment information and insurance coverage. Several days later, I drove my trade-in car to the lot, the checked it out in a short time. I drove the car I had chosen on the internet, all was fine. Signed the paperwork and was on my way, in my wife's new car in short order!

Both Gina and her supervisor, James Lovely, were honest and understanging of the limited amount of time I had to devote to finding a vehicle.  More importantly, neither ever acted over zealously in closing the deal, but rather seemed genuinely concerned about finding the right car for our daughter and at the right price.

None of the usual ""I have to check with my manager"" or low-balling the bid.  The entire transaction was completed in about 2 hours from start to finish.  Barry called the next day to check on the purchase and to thank me for my business.  I had just purchased the day before a new  $103,000 sports car for my wife and had been provided perfect service.  I was not surprised by that since the dealership is known for its professionalism and the car was high dollar.  However I was pleasantly surprised to be accorded the same professional treatment at Bankston by Barry and his associates the next day when I purchased a vehicle for less than $20,000.

JT was waiting for us and very anxious to make things right. Ended up figuring out it was just a fluke issue with that particular equinox but ended up buying a 2012 anyway. I really wish JT could have handled the deal all by himself because my experience with the finance guy ""mike"" was HORRIBLE!! He was very arrogant, rude and unprofessional which I found surprising since we have better than most credit wise. To make a long story short the GM had to get involved and I'm really glad because she was as pleasant as JT. I can't leave out the used car manager Shawn. He was really nice as well.

The biggest complaint was the minimum amount of finance advisors available and the fact that if everything is done before arrival the paperwork should already be ready to expedite the process.
