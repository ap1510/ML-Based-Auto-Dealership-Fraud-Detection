From Albert in Service to Todd in sales I always feel comfortable And safe knowing they wouldn't put me in a vehicle that they Wouldn't put their own family in.

All the salespeople are so friendly along with the finance dept to The very sweet ladies in the office. I will always buy my vehicles from them! I tell everyone how great this place is!!!",5.0
1,"February 28, 2014","They screwed up all paperwork was changed after signing ,items were added that were not there,price amonts were changed.I tried getting my trade in back but they would not let me have it back.I tried going to BBB but they are a sponsored member and I never heard back on the complaint I filed with BBB so I filed it 3 more times each time no replys back and when I would inquire about them they either said they never recieved it or it got lost , 2 of them were sent registered mail the last 2 times I sent them but nothing was ever done on my behalf.I am on a fixed disability income so I could not afford a lawyer to persue it further.Bunch of crooked people do not do buisness with them.",1.8

3,"February 15, 2013","I purchased an extended warranty from here and when I needed to use it after the car has needed repair numerous times, they would not even make time to look at the car and the way the warranty is worded it has to be serviced at this dealership unless a manager there gives permission for the car to be serviced at another dealership, they have no managers there and Greg May doesn't actually exist.  No one there is helpful and they all ""mock you"".  That is the worst dealership I have ever dealt with.  I hope they close soon.",1.0
4,"December 27, 2012","I needed service on my vehicle; but, also decided to check out what they had on the lot.
 
I was extremely surprised at the huge inventory.  I checked it out and found a vehicle I was interested in.
 
The Salesperson came up and was extremely helpful in answering all of my questions and all letting me know of my financial options for what I could get.  It was great because I took a test drive on the vehicle of my choice and am very happy to say that I now have a Silverado of my choice with a payment plan that is well within my budget.
 
The service on my vehicle was quick, professional and a good price.  
 
The Salesperson was helpful in getting the vehicle of my choice and at a payment plan that I could afford.
 
Would I recommend Greg May Chevrolet in West to my family and friends...well...I would say that was a definite yes.",5.0
5,"December 19, 2012",I had a great day buying a car today!!!! As a mother of three I needed something that would help me get from point A to point B and back without breaking my bank account. Mark really helped me and got me in a car that not only could I afford but one that looks great too. He made the process really fun and simple. I think everyone should go to Greg May Chevrolet and buy a car. I will be back.,5.0

7,"November 02, 2012",Mack and Albert have always been very friendly and professional in all my service dealings with them.  I have had my vehicles serviced there for many years.  I have never had any problems with their service folks and am well pleased.  They both try to treat all their customers like we are their first priority.  Our town is very lucky to have them here.,5.0
8,"November 02, 2012","My family and extended family has been using Greg May Chevrolet since they opened in 2008.  Their service department is exceptional and their sales staff is very friendly & knowledgable.  They will not let you leave until you are completely satisfied.  As a company, Mary Hromadka referred us to their Fleet department and we have enjoyed working with their fleet manager, Gus Krueger.  ",5.0
9,"July 27, 2011","Took my 2008 Malibu to the service department to figure out why water was pooling on my rear passenger floorboard.  Had done some research online myself and found that Chevy Malibu's have had problems with the a/c lines getting clogged.  Dropped my car off on a Tuesday morning, did not receive a call from the dealership the whole day about what the problem was.  I called the service department Wednesday morning and was told my car would be ready to pick up in about an hour, they needed to put my seats back in.  WHAT???  Mack told me at that time that it was a clogged a/c drain, they had fixed it and pulled up my carpets to clean water.  I inquired at that time about the cost (since they didn't even communicate to me what the problem was) and I was told the invoice was not ready, but they would ""shoot me straight"" RIGHT!!! $294.00 later my a/c drain is unclogged and my carpets cleaned and treated with Lysol.  Are you kidding me???  Whatever happened to speaking with customers and communicating cost before repairing a vehicle???  Treating with Lysol???  I could have done that for a hell of alot less.  $256.89 of my bill was labor, yet no labor hours were listed. Very unhappy with this dealership and very unhappy with Chevrolet's customer service department.  My grandfather is a retired GM employee and he would be rolling over in his grave right now.  Have owned many Chevy vehicles and I will think twice about EVER purchasing another one!",1.4
10,"July 09, 2011","Avalanche, when delivered, was not equipped as we were led to believe. Owner would not take $1,500 offered just to cancel the deal and get my old Avalanche back.  Rude behavior from both floor managers.  After I finally took the truck, they did not send my my personalized plates as they had said they would. Instead they sent regular plates.  When I called the dealership about the problem, they said they would call me when they found how to solve the problem.  After I did not hear from them, the next day I went to the county tax office.  The official there called the title clerk from the dealership who did have my own plates delivered to the county office, and then the official and I corrected May Chevrolet's latest lousy service.",1.4
