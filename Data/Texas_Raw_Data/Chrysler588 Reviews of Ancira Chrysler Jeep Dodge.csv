7,"June 02, 2020","I had a terrible experience with this car lot on 6/1/2020. The sales man Orton appeared to be very helpful and professional. I am a frontline registered nurse and have been working everyday since March in NY and was only trying to purchase my daughter a birthday gift so I had 1 day off. I spent my entire day off going back and forth sending them all my information about a car I was trying to pay cash for. I paid a company to drive over to pick the car up once the paper work was done and sent to me. It took them 4 hours to figure out how to determine the taxes for alabama vs Texas. With my paperwork and everything sent over to me. I receive a text message from Orton this morning 6/2/20 that said the car was sold last night (while the store was closed I suppose)....Being that the last time I talked with him and received my paperwork was at 730pm. This was dishonest, unprofessional and just wrong!

11,"May 15, 2020","I recently purchased a gently used New Ram limited 4*4 truck. I say new because it only had 11k on mileage. I had purchased my Chrysler 300 C Platinum from Ancira new in 2016 and I noticed a great deal on the 2019 truck, and it basically sold itself. If you're asking why I didn't give it a 5 star rating since I purchased two vehicles from this dealership I will just say there is always room for improvement, and as hard as they worked to get me everything I needed for my trade in, and to make sure that I got everything needed for the new truck. With that said if you want a good deal, and professional courtesy please go talk to Joe Ramirez and his managers Johnny, and Joe Garza. They will treat you right",4.8

60,"December 13, 2019","We purchased a brand new Jeep Wrangler Rubicon from Ancira about 5 months ago. The Jeep (JL) has 2500 miles on it now. Today I had 2 warning indicators come on - the ESC & the A (automatic start system). I followed all prompts as directed to remedy this on my own. None of the instructions resolved the issue. Since I bought the Jeep at Ancira, I called them to get the warranty work done & warning lights resolved.   Ancira's  earliest appointment is 7 days from today. The next available appt is 7 Jan (according to scheduler). I was referred to find another dealership to do the service...which I will be doing for this work as well as all future work. I called another dealership and am taking it in Monday morning, 2 days from now. Due to both warning indicators being on, the other dealership got me an appointment. Great customer service from Boerne Jeep! Thank you. ",3.0

87,"August 02, 2019",Had to drop off my vehicle for a transmission rebuild through the powertrain.  While I didn’t have an appointment I do expect some sort of update throughout the process.  I have had to call the service department multiple times only to be told that my service advisor is the only one who can give me an update.  Well he doesn’t return calls and the only updates I’ve been able to was on the odd occasion he answered the phone.  Very disappointing as a simple call or email with status updates would have helped.  There was an offer of a loaner car BUT every time I checked it was either checked out or being cleaned which only made me think there was no loaner car.  Dodge isn’t paying for my rental car which is fine but now 2 weeks is turning into 3 after I finally got an update from someone else in shop. I cannot recommend this service department at all.,1.3

100,"July 15, 2019","BEWARE when dealing with Ancira.  Make your salesman explain every single kings of their proposal before you sign it.  DO NOt sign any paperwork with having it all explained to you! Most importantly don t trust the salesman, twisted words will be used to make you believe one thing when actually you're being lied to.
I purchased 2 different vehicles from Ancira over the last couple of years with great results. I walked out both times feeling wonderful about the whole transaction. Yesterday after I left having being there to more than 7 1\2 hours, I felt like I'd been ran over by a truck! But when I got home and realized how I'd been treated like a fool and lied to i contacted the salesman who put me off to someone else and promised to call me the next morning. I did hear from two different men who could care less about the underhanded way I was treated. They will not let me return the car or try to make the deal right.

Service tech on vacation  The service managers, John Scharmann and Philip, will not come to the phone or return calls. Tried to call the new car sales manager (Paul) who I purchased the car from.  Will not come to the phone. The dealership manager (David Tullo) will not come to the phone.

So the brand new $55,000 truck I just bought from Ancira CDJ to drive on a vacation out West this summer has unresolved electrical problems and TSB brakes that have not been repaired.  I am beyond frustrated with these guys.  I'm thinking of renting a Ford or Chevy truck to take on the vacation.

The jury is out on this truck. Some good. Some bad.  The jury has come in on Ancira CDJ: They are incompetent and they don't care.",1.2

110,"May 28, 2019","The salesperson I dealt with was pretty attentive to my needs and took the time to answer my questions. When the car they originally brought down for me didn’t have the options that I wanted, he didn’t pressure me into buying something that wasn’t right and found what I wanted at another dealer. The biggest issue with the transaction was the wait time to meet with their finance guy (they happened to be short-staffed that night) but they did keep me up to date on how long it would take. Overall a good experience. ",3.8

From the moment I walked in, everyone was attentive and friendly.  I met with Cody and Javier and they really took their time to understand what I was looking for in a Jeep.  They were very patient with me and worked with me to make sure I was getting the best deal, making me feel comfortable throughout the car buying experience.  I highly recommend Ancira, and try to work with Cody and Javier if you can!!",5.0
120,"May 02, 2019","It was my first service for my new car.  I never been in the service Dept before so I was very confused on the procedure on how to check in.  I pulled into their service floor and no one came outside after 10 minutes waiting in the service floor parking lot.   I decided to go inside to check in, all the technicians are sitting on chairs with a counter to separate them from the customers.  I told one tech, it was my first car service, and right away, I was ask with Who?  I told the technician who I was assigned to, and was redirected to that technician.   The technician I was redirected to, seems to be very frazzle with the workload he had over his counter on top of three more customers in from of me while the other technicians were joking and talking.   Why no one of his peers think of helping him, I don’t know.  But it was ver frustrating to be in there for 45 minutes before he can attend to me.  When he was able to talk with me, he informed me due to the problems my vehicle was experiencing that he was going to keep the vehicle for a day or two to find the cause, so I was giving a rental.  I thought that was a good compromise.   Anyway, my vehicle was dropped off on Monday morning, Tuesday not word on the status, Wednesday afternoon around 11 in the morning I decided to call asking for the status of my vehicle.   First time I phoned, The operator informed me, my technician was busy with another customer, and he would call me back.  15 minutes later, and he did.   He apologized for not able to take my call and gave me the status of my vehicle, told me that everyone went to lunch and I couldn’t get my vehicle yet, but that he would call me around 2:30 in the afternoon to let me know if I could.   Never happened.  So, by 4:00 in the afternoon, I decided to be more proactive and call.   Again, he was busy, and he will call me back.  15 minutes later, he was apologizing for not able to answering the phone and calling me back to let me know if I could pick up my car.   At this point he informed me I could.  I was excited but disappointed with the level of inefficiency within the company.  These are some of my personal suggestions to make that place on running much better.  Firstly, When you pulled in to the station for a service, some technician should be redirecting to you where you need to go or checking you in the spot with an iPad.  Using technology is beneficial on this circumstance.  If that is not possible a sign with instructions on the check in process.  

Secondly, technicians should be able to help anyone that come by the office if there are free. 

Thirdly, have a computer system where anyone can give you a level explanation on the status of your car, it would help the technicians improve overall experience with the customers on site without interruptions.   

There is more ideas I have but for the purpose of this review.  I think I am giving my most honest answer of my experience.  ",2.6

He even showed me how to use the coffee machine to make a delicious café latte. Sammy, the finance manager, lacks good interpersonal skills. He was rude in telling me that I don't  seem to trust him because I was reading the documents so closely before signing them. We left unhappy and in-doubt whether we made a good deal or not. We went back the next day to have them remove the EXTRA unnecessary warranties which was added to our purchase. Fortunately, Anthony, another finance manager, was gracious and understanding about our concerns. He removed the EXTRA unnecessary warranties. We went back to the dealership the following week to pick up our license plate. Paul was busy with some customers, and Vince offered to  explain to us in detail, each of the icons and services pictured on the car's front communication panel.

I had to go inside and get attitude right up front from the first service advisor who saw me. You can always tell when people don’t like doing their jobs and he was certainly one of them. It felt like I was bothering him just by the scowl on his face and the rude way he asked whether or not I have purchased the vehicle from the dealership, as though because I didn’t I was going to be  treated with less enthusiasm and friendliness. His next question rudely asked was do you have an appointment? When I answered no he rolled his eyes and figured oh great another one. This was just for a simple oil change by the way. Also he assumed that the jeep wave program I was a part of May not pay for the full oil change and then I’m I have to pay more. Again any way to actually make me leave instead of giving me good service. The location was clean and very nice amenities however the service advisors definitely need more training.

The lackadaisical attitudes, the 'we are doing you a favor by even acknowledging you presence’ is just appalling.  This started from the time I called them with the snobby attitude on the phone, to the minute I walked into the service department and everyone was either ‘busy’ or just staring at their computer monitors.  I have a huge right up going into detail, but it is too large to post here.  To think that they are the ‘best’ inside of 1604 of the Dodge dealerships is just amazing.  Can’t imagine what the others are like.  Thank God I purchased a extended warranty and was able to take it to Alamo Toyota where they performed the repair of a oil sending unit replacement for free, and even offered me a loaner vehicle.  Ancira, you want to learn how to treat your customers?  Hire Ronnie at Alamo Toyota and give him a raise to boot.   I can sum it up with this:  ‘Your keys are at the cashiers booth’.  That’s it.  Will never make this mistake again. ",1.0
256,"July 20, 2017","In summary: Worst car buying experience we've ever had. I've never worked so hard to give someone my money. Do not shop here. Tell your friends not to shop here. Spend your money elsewhere and safe yourself a lot of misery. 

In detail: This was a good experience until we committed to purchasing a vehicle and signing our names on paper. At that point, we were handed off from one person to another (working with a total of 5 different people!), with poor communication between the employees and multiple mistakes made. There was no disclosure of the total price, financing options, or APR until we explicitly asked for it and, even then they were not forthcoming with the information. Additionally, our initial APR offer from them was over 5% until we informed them that we would be financing through another company. At that point their APR offer quickly dropped to less than 3%. We stuck with our other financing options. 

By TX law, the dealership has to register the vehicle for you. We wanted to register the vehicle in our home state and transfer my old plates, as we're only in TX temporarily. We were told that we couldn't do that. A quick call to our home state DMV confirmed that, yes, actually we could and suddenly the problem was solved. The dealership also held onto the registration paper work for 3 WEEKS after everything was official, further delaying the registration process. They had initially told us the paper work would be mailed off the same week we received the vehicle. This is unacceptable. When I called to check the status of the registration, Michelle, the Title Clerk,  rudely interrogated me as to why we chose to register our vehicle in a state other than TX (she did not approve of our decision).... obviously mailing a stack of 10 papers instead of 5 is too much of a hassle, even for someone who has just spent over $40,000 with your company. This is an example of pathetic laziness and extremely poor customer service. 

We have continuously had to call and go back to the dealership to follow up on paperwork (I went back 3 times after we signed everything) and they always come up with an excuse as to why the job isn't finished yet. What it comes down to in the end is they only want your money and are not concerned with maintaining appropriate business integrity, honest disclosure with their customers, or good customer service relationships. I would give them 0/5 stars if I could. ",1.2
257,"June 09, 2017","The dealership sold me a synthetic oil change, then proceeded to use semi-synthetic oil instead. This was not discovered until my Jeep collapsed.

258,"February 04, 2017","This business has had many opportunities to make a positive experience with me; for me to give a poor review would require a lot.

A few days later, I drove to Boerne but couldn't find the Ancira lot so I stopped in to Boerne Dodge.  They had the exact truck and were willing to meet my requests regarding price, interest rate (1.9%), etc.  I just didn't know if wanted to make the drive Boerne to get it serviced.  Ancira called me back and said they'd get me into a similar truck and beat the deal Boerne offered.  I went to Ancira and they were going to throw in 6 free oil changes so I said okay.  When I got into the finance office they were rushing me to sign all the paperwork but the payments were higher so I asked them what the interest rate was.  They said 4.59%.  4.59%???  Really??  I asked why.  He said it is based on my credit score.  I knew what my score was before I ever went.  I asked him to tell me what my score was.  He replied 817.  Exactly, because I had checked it before going.  I had been assured they could beat Boerne's offer but Ancira simply wanted to screw me over.  After wasting two hours of my time, I politely told them that I would NEVER return because I didn't believe in dealing with dishonest businesses. 

I drove to Boerne and got my truck and an interest rate under 2%.  Boerne did everything they promised so they will be my choice every time my family buys a new vehicle. I'll happily make the drive to Boerne if/when service is needed.

265,"January 14, 2016","GOOD?BY?ANCIRA - This was the last straw
We have always loved the Ancira dealership’s. Since1981, we have purchased 7 cars from Ancira. We are both Senior Citizens and it seems like each dealerships played off of that this time 1/7/2016. I walk with a cane. 

In 2011, a tire blew, lost control and rolled 5 times. We felt that Durango, saved our lives.When we were released from the hospital, Enterprise, loaned us a brand new 
Durango (ironic, right), we had 5 days to pick out a new vehicle as we had 10 days paid for Enterprise. We called Ancira of course! So we searched the internet  We were not in any shape to go and shop for a new vehicle, so their internet. service really worked for us. We found a Dodge Durango Citadel from the internet. All the bells and whistle we haggled a little, then purchased a very nice Durango. Another great experience from Ancira.


We called Ancira Dodge, as they have always been good to us. We spoke with David Tullo, General Sales Manager, we spoke about the Durango Citadel, we had all the bells and whistles, our Durango was in pristine condition. 
Before we went to Ancira Dodge, we looked around at several dealerships. I did not ask for the appraisal untill we were given a price for the vehicle.
Below is what we were offered, after we found an automobile.

Cavander Buick offered $24,000
Gunn Buick offered $25,000
Lone Star Dodge $24,000

We asked over and over for the appraisal & what was their offer, price for the vehicle. What the payments would be. We were shown a beautiful Durango Citadel, and also a Town & Country. There was no information about any of this available. David Tullo came around and said we had $860.00 coming from programs we would be cancelling when our Durango signed over to the dealerships. He said we could apply it to the new vehicle or he would have a check cut so we would have the cash back.                                                      

We were deciding a choice of 1 Durango or 1 mini van. Our salesman would never give us information that we would request such as how much our payments would be, the interest rate, he just kept saying I am getting it right now. We wanted to see if mini van or Durango which one was the better price. Our salesman said the Durango. Them he came to his office where we were sitting and then said he was wrong that the mini van had a better price. Again we asked how much the payments would be as well as the interest. James told us he sends some of his clients to car max. They give you more money for your trade. James said you go over to carmax

Our salesman, said to come over here, he has all the figures, he will call you back in just a minute.

They also had a television give away, our salesman- James said that promotion had ended the day before, we kept seeing people cartying out the television’s. We asked our salesman James again, he said they had previously purchased a vehicle and they have came in to get their TV. He said all the TV’s were picked up the day before and were all gone.  The TV was not such a big deal, but we when we were going to the back the second office on the right was 2 pallets plus more stacked around it. That made my husband and myself start to question the ethics of James our salesman. 

The person we were sent to see was a finance manager. He had all the contracts ready for us to sign. We had never said to proceed without knowing all the figures. We had to ask him all the questions our salesman should have asked and gave us the information. They also lo-balled out trade in at $19,000. We were both upset over this.We were both really questioning not just the ethics of James - But the Ancira name. It all of the Ancira dealerships we have been in or purchased from.

We decided that we would go home and think about it. We did not need a new car - It just seemed like it was good time. The next day around 3pm we took James advice and went to Carmax for an appraisal. We advised James we were going to Carmax and then we would be at Ancira Dodge. Ancira’s 19,000 and 25,000 from 2 dealers. Carmax w very nice. When you sit down while they were doing the appraisal. There is a computer on the table and you can look at any cars. I was surprised that they had 2016 vehicles with mileage from 500 to 10,000. 2015 Durango’s with 425 miles. We decided on a vehicle at Carmax.

I called the next day to Ancira Dodge. James said to talk to someone in finance about collecting the $860.00 due to us for the canceling the coverage. When we were buying the car at Ancira David said would cut a check Juan Gomez asked David and now I need to wait 5 - 6 weeks since we did not buy a car there. I told him I was going to write about my experience all over the internet, he did not care, I said OK

266,"October 04, 2015",I had a great experience at the dealership being my first time there. Reggie was very persistent with his sales manager to get me the price and payments I wanted. I even spoke with sales manager and was very professional. They were willing to do anything make me happy with the vehicle I selected and I had no worries. The car is still running great and am very happy with the dealership.,5.0
267,"September 16, 2015","I recently bought a 2016 Jeep Cherokee from this dealer through James Sirbek.  James greeted my husband and me as soon as we pulled into the lot and within minutes, and by asking just a few key questions, he had gathered enough information to show us exactly what we were looking for.  James told us the features of the various types of Jeep SUVs and helped us narrow down and ultimately select one for serious consideration.  James scheduled a test drive for us (at our convenience) and followed through with that commitment.  We arrived a couple of days later and he had the car ready for the drive and guided us through the buying process with ease.  (Leo is financing was great too!)

I would recommend James and this dealership to anyone who has a passion for Jeeps (this is our third)  and appreciates professionalism and courteous service.

Thanks, James!

268,"July 08, 2015","I had heard good things about Ancira and their service dept but was very disappointed at the treatment I received. I took my Jeep in for a warranty issue and had a part in my hand that obviously should've been attached to my vehicle. I was redirected several times to different service advisers and finally found the ""warranty claims"" guy. Stood in front of his desk, part in hand, as he chummed it up with another customer about how to mod his vehicle without voiding the warranty due to some ""loopholes."" The customer worked in the automotive service field at Caliber Collision Center on San Pedro (this is how long I was waiting that I picked up full parts of their conversation standing beside him for about 20 minutes) and they chatted on an on about other guys who had tricked out their jeeps and messed over the system, etc... Anyhow, he finally leaves and Paul Carter the service adviser gives me about 3 full minutes of his time, tells me he can't service my vehicle, instructs me to take it back to where I bought it (200+ miles away) because he won't be handling it there. Wow. Ok. I walked out and never want to step back in that service department again.",1.0

273,"September 17, 2014","We drove up from Corpus Christi to test drive a 2014 Ram 1500 that I found on the internet site. I spoke with Bennett Nwokeafor in the Internet Sales Department to pin down a price on the vehicle before I even went in to the dealer. He was very helpful and professional in explaining what they had in their inventory. Ancira had my dream truck available in the Western Brown color that I wanted with many more options for a much better price than what the Dodge dealers in the Corpus Christi area were offering. We showed up on Memorial Day (9/1/14) right before closing time. We were afraid they wouldn't make time for us with it being so close to the end of the day, but the opposite happened. We were greeted when we first came in by Joey Alma, our who ended up being our sales associate, and he took great care in making sure that we knew everything about the vehicle before we purchased. We drove with him to the storage lot in Boerne where my truck was being stored, and he explained all of the features along the way. He was very knowledgeable about the Ram brand, and I love that the truck came with a free bed liner and running boards with our USAA discount. When we finalized everything, he took us to see Nathan Bates, who explained all of the financing options and warranties available to us. He and Joey worked with us until almost 11 p.m., when Joey hopped in the truck with us and showed me how to pair my phone and use the Uconnect system before we left. I drove home to Corpus Christi with a huge grin on my face in my new Ram.

We are very pleased with our experience at Ancira Chrysler Dodge Jeep and definitely agree that you have to drive to a big city to find the salespeople who know the vehicles they sell, and to get treated right. Price was definitely part of it because I ended up saving almost $9,000.00 compared to what I would have paid in my home town for a similarly priced Ram. Great job Ancira!",5.0

275,"March 05, 2014","I'm not necessarily reviewing the dealership, more so the salesman that helped me. My salesman was Robert Hoover who seemed like a nice man in the beginning when I was looking for a vehicle and then after he sold the car it was a different story. Towards the beginning of purchasing the car he was persistent in trying to get me the car which he did when I had a co signer. After everything was done, I had added a spoiler to the car that I would need to bring the car back so they could install it. I assumed he would give me a call on the day I was off from work because when I purchased the car he said the spoiler would be in. Thinking smart, I had to call him myself that day because I hadn't heard anything and I wasn't going to drive all the way over there and the spoiler wouldn't have been there, so I called Robert ""Bob"" and he said that the spoiler wouldn't be in in about a week, so a week went by and again I assumed he would give me a call informing me that the spoiler was in and no call so I called AGAIN to see if the spoiler was in and it was. Now I should have known this guy wasn't great because I didn't feel like it was my responsibility to call to see if the spoiler was in, it was his responsibility as a salesman to let the customer know. Strike 1...so took the car in and he let me know that it would take about an hr which turned into an hr and 45 min.  As a salesman it's also important to let the customer know the expectation of the wait time and Robert did no such thing, strike 2...now here's where this guy decides he doesn't care, He gives me the keys and tells me that he filled up the car with a full tank of gas, now he had been telling me that he would fill up the car with a full tank about 3 times before I took it in to get the spoiler, he let me know that when they would put the spoiler on there would be a full tank. I take a look at the LEFT side of the car and the spoiler and it seemed fine and then I start the car to find that the tank wasn't full!!! Now I'm not cheap, I could pay for my own gas but when someone says about 4 times that he's gonna fill up the tank, I expect a FULL tank of gas! Then I noticed some of the interior had dirt marks on it, the least they could do was wipe it down, this is a new vehicle, best believe I expect it the way I brought it! They got Robert for me and I explained the situation and I could tell he was frustrated but took the car back to fill it up. As I was waiting, sales manager Paul Knoblock stopped to speak with me while I was waiting for my car and I explained the situation to him and he was extremely understandable and helpful. When Robert came back to give me my keys, he was aggravated and repeatedly told me that he went out of his way to get me the car and that ""he bent over backwards"" to get me the spoiler, the spare key, and so forth and that's when I got angry. I did not need to be disrespected and that was definitely the button he shouldn't have pushed. As a customer I expect great service and respect and ROBERT HOOVER didn't show that at all. So Paul saw what was going on and he took it upon himself to take over with any issues I would have in the future with the car which I was grateful for. After that mess I go home and take a look at the car even further and I notice a pretty noticeable paint chip on the RIGHT side of the car that I know I didn't do! Strike 3,4,&5...This is a brand new 2014 vehicle and me being the detailed person that I am, I noticed it right away, luckily Paul is going to take care of it but I'm extremely disappointed at this point. This was not great service and this Robert  Hoover only cared about the sale and could care less about servicing customers and making sure everything was satisfactory. ",2.8

278,"August 26, 2013","We purchased a new 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee Overland from Ancira in July 2013. This is the third brand new Jeep Grand Cherokee we have purchased there since 2008. Always had our vehicles serviced there, too.

Drove the new car off the lot on Sunday afternoon and experienced problems with radio/navigation unit starting Tuesday. Car went in for repairs and a new radio/navigation unit was installed. When we inspected the vehicle after return from dealership, we noticed several damages. 

1) My car was sticky and dirty on the inside. It was obvious that something had been spilled. 
2) Oil stains on floor mats.
3) Dent in the leather dash board.
4) Scratches on panel of the newly replaced navigation/radio unit.
5) Scratch on panel of stirring wheel.

Returned car to dealer for repairs of damages their employees had caused. This was the second time my car was in the shop for days.

New dash board had to be ordered and took approx. 2 weeks to come in so then we had to return it to dealer for the third time.

We had a meeting with General Manager, Mr. Reininger and the Service Director. Both were very apologetic and promised to ""make it right"". We discussed giving the car back or to get a discount in case we were willing to keep the vehicle. Meeting was ended and we never heard again from either gentleman. No discount and dealership refused a trade of vehicles for the same monthly payment. We were offered a slightly more expensive car for a $120 more a month. No, thank you. 

Meanwhile we had more issues with the car. Lumbar support would randomly reset itself and car didn't start on several occasions. While driving to the dealership the new navigation unit went blank and reset itself.

While the car was at the dealership the service department was not able to start my car on several occasions and a senior technician was supposed to be sent out by Chrysler. We were dealing with Ancira as well as a Chrysler case manager to get the issues resolved. Conflicting statements were made by both. There seemed to be a lack of communication between Chrysler and Ancira.

Long story short....they returned my car with paperwork stating that they were not able to find any faults with it. That is very strange as our service manager told us that THEY could not start the car 2 days in a row. Also, car was returned without them putting on my handicapped license plates that they had at the dealership for approx.2-3 weeks. Trip back to Ancira on Friday for license plates. Saturday morning I noticed that a panel under the glove compartment was not attached correctly and hanging lose. Trip back to Ancira on Saturday. 

2 weeks ago we tried again to get into another vehicle....same color, same car, no extras, no discount, not making outrageous demands. Just, please, get us into a car that works. We have spent well over $100.000 in the last 5 years at your dealership and expect some kind of customer service. My husband is a 100% disabled veteran and we need a car we can depend on. He has been late to work on 2 occasions due to the car not starting and we can't even count the hours we have spent dealing with this lemon. Or the amount of gas we have wasted by having to go back and forth to the dealership.

General manager who had promised us to ""make it right"" was never available and we had to deal with Jarrod, a sales manager, who told us that he can't make his numbers right and the best he can do is to get us in another Jeep with the same equipment for $50-60 more a month. They didn't have the color we had picked and were not willing ""to eat up any more costs"" by getting a vehicle from another dealer. Also, he seemed to think that I was being ""picky"" because I did not want a white car instead of the granite one we had picked. Well, I do think I should be able to pick my favorite color on a brand new $45.000 car. But maybe that's just me and my ridiculous ""demands"". Overall very rude, snarky and seemed to be bothered. Why help a good customer if he had already signed and paid for the vehicle, right?

Let me tell you why. I am a good customer, your company sold me a car that has nothing but problems, your employees damaged my property, I have been more than patient, your general manager made a verbal promise to ""make it right"" and you should just have some basic manners. Also, you just lost 2 more sales due to your lack of customer service skills and attitude. It was already discussed with our salesman that we will buy a Chrysler 300 next month and he was supposed to look for an adequate car for our teenage driver. Ancira has lost my business. 

I also like how Ancira takes great pride in ""supporting our troops and the Wounded Warrior Project"". I respect that very much and we are thankful for all supporters for that great cause. But don't get all the positive media coverage for that and than turn around and screw a 100% service related disabled veteran that has served your country for almost 26 years.

On a positive note I would like to mention, that we have never had any problems with ""our"" salesman, Jay, who we have bought all 3 cars from. Jay and his assistant Thomas were always very polite and helpful and I appreciate that.

Traded in my old car, put money down and the deal was done...or so I thought. about 8 days later I lost my job, the bank who gave me the loan tried calling my former employer, and of course they told them I was no longer employed with them. I get a knock on my door and its the salesman asking me to come down to the dealership with the car, I head down and basically I am about to get hosed over badly. If I do not get the car financed they will have to take it, but wait I thought the loan was approved and done. No not really, the part the is not explained to you is that they give you the car on the contention that the loan will be approved. Ok, well, give me my trade in car back. We cant do that because we already sold it. ok, well where is my deposit. That was used to pay for the new car, and well, since you have had it for awhile, its a break even thing, you might get back a $100 or so. 

In short, I was told the car was mine, bad luck hit, they want it back and of course they will not give me back the trade in car, and basically none of my deposit, WTH!!! No one will approve me because I am out of work. I was screwed over big time. They should not have sold the trade in car UNTIL the loan was completed. Since this was my only car, I asked what am I suppose to do for a car, how am I even going to get home now? all I got was a shrug of the shoulders. Such a caring and kind company.

I did manage to pull off getting the car, by the skin of my teeth, but the point still remains that they sold of the tradein before the loan was approved. I did get a response from Ancira with the first writing of this post. See below.

From Ancira
The fact that you lost your job, the Bank is entitled to resend their loan offer. I do apologize for the inconvenience from the lender. I am trying to see what I can do on my behalf to assist you with this post. Can you please call me at 210-558-XXXX. Thank you, Mark Almazan

I understand the banks position, no problem with it. What I had to explain multiple times was the simple fact of selling off the trade in before the loan was finalized, as you can see from the response above they still just don't get it, perhaps they do get it, but just don't want to admit to it. Why cant anyone just say 'sorry about that. we screwed up on that, and sorry for the way we treated you' The response from Ancira was poor and uncaring. I replied to the above message with roughly the same thing, I have yet to hear back from them, and I doubt I will. Just goes to show you the true character of a company and its employees.

It took them a week, but they finally responded....

Mr. Gonzalez

It is unfortunate that the loss of your job shortly after the purchase of the vehicle complicated matters with the bank, and they exercised their right to rescind the loan. When your new vehicle was returned, yes your trade-in had been sold. Your trade-in was paid off, your loan was accepted by the bank, and at that point we were able to proceed with the sale. We didn't do anything that was improper or not of normal business practice. The bank rescinding the loan was beyond our control. If perhaps less time had passed, and we still had your trade, then it may have been possible for us to unwind the entire deal, but unfortunately that was not the case. However I am glad that everything ended up working out for you and you were able to keep the new vehicle. 

As far as the salesperson not treating you the way you expected or deserved, we do apologize. We appreciate hearing feedback, good and bad, as that is how we can address (or praise) issues. But, with this particular employee, it turns out he no longer works for us, so that cannot be addressed. 

Again, we are sorry you went through an unpleasant experience. We strive to ensure all our customers have a very positive experience. We feel our nearly perfect review rating speaks for itself due to the voluminous, very satisfied customer reviews. 

Thank you.

Its still bad business practice to sell off a trade in before the deal is finalized. Just have to keep in mind, some businesses would rather turn a dime in a day than a week, even if its a risk on the customer. A dime is a dime after all. ",2.0

When we first arrived I had some questions on vehicles at the sales lot, salesmen Steven Marte was humble and knowledgeable and was able to help.
I had previously spoken to Salesman Joey on the phone earlier that day, so I wanted to complete my purchase with him.
Joey was busy with two other families at the time of our arrival, He was polite and took time to introduced us to salesman Sam Solano.
Sam Solano was awesome, he took his time with us, being first time car buyers, He helped us get into a car that was right for our situation.
We Financed our very first car!
We did stay past office hours finishing paperwork, Joey was kind enough to stay and see we had everything good to go.

M. McConkey took us to see it, and we also saw a 300S in the same color. We then had a hard time deciding which car to buy, and M. McConkey moved one next to the other so we could compare side by side. He then very patiently explained the differences, a big job as we are not very tech savy,showing us the different attributes, again and again, until he had me sit inside both cars and turned on the opera music station so I could hear and compare the sound in both cars, in the frontseat and in the back.
After the test drive, we opted for the 300S. 
Then the usual discussion followed. M. McConkey again was very informative, patient, and considerate of our offer, showing a sophistication way beyong his young age. He was pleasant, polite and serious from beginning to end, and when we agreed on the price,he directed us to the final paperwork quickly as I had told him were expecting dinner guests.We had to go and he agreed to provide a needed ""tutorial"" on the various functions of this vehicle at a later date. 
M. McConkey was a huge factor in our decision to buy this car, as we had already walked out of two other Chrysler dealerships in the past two weeks. We had a 2006 Chrysler 300 Limited, which we loved as we take long road trips, and were considering getting a newer one, but it was not an urgent need.
Everyone we encountered was pleasant and helpful, including Leigh who speaks beautiful French, a treat for me as I am from France.

David answered all my questions and didn't have to go ""check"" with anyone else or find the answer due to lack of knowledge. He was so relatable and made me very comfortable. I immediately realized I could trust him to guide me through this process to find the right vehicle for me. I felt like he knew so much but didn't push me and if he had any personal preferences he wasn't biased because of them. I liked that while we were with him we had his undivided attention. He wasn't greedy trying to juggle 6 clients at the same time like I've seen some sales people do in the past. I had two trips to the dealership, my first trip I was very unsure so I decided to table the offer I had received and he had no hard feelings. I came back and David knew exactly who I was and located my paperwork right away. He made the same deal happen that we discussed during my first visit. It was seamless!
I also dealt with Paul Knoblock and he was great as well. He paid attention to my family and kept them engaged while I was dealing with the particulars.

I had previously completed all research needed and proposed prices for both my trade in and purchase pf new vehicle that was probdide through USAA to match your certified dealership. I was noy there to play the number game of way underbiddinh the value of my trade after he told me if was spotless. Once we went back and forth and the trade was slowly increasing still way below the value i asked for my keys. He did not say goodbye pr anything just handed them to me and walked away. Also he failed to tell me he had moved my Jeep tothe back of the store so i looked like an idiot looking everywhere for my car. I had to walk back up to the store and ask the other salesman of its location. This was after they seem me walking up and down and aroundthe building lookimg for my car.

412,"October 02, 2012","I initially met with Steven Marte but then got handed off to Robert Hoover. I requested to meet a sales manager and was introduced to Paul Knoblock. When I returned to the dealership I was reunited with Steven Marte which was a little odd since I was starting to build a relationship with Robert. Steven stepped up his game in making me feel comfortable, but when requested to provide me a copy of the invoice it was never forthcoming although I was assured I would receive a copy. However, Steven continued to build on our relationship, but was hampered by his sales manager. In other words, I had just paid cash for a Dodge Dart Limited which is fully loaded. It takes time to go over all the gadgets and explain their functionality etc. Steven excelled in explaining and demonstrating the multitude of options this vehicle contains, not to mention professionally answering my questions. UNFORTUNATELY, THE SALES MANAGER'S LACK OF OPERATIONAL SKILLS (BRAIN-POWER)effected the overall experience. Sales Manager decided to walk up to the car while Steven was demonstrating the awesomeness of the options and pound on the window to say that Steven had a phone call and a customer waiting for him. The bonehead (Sales Manager) didn't even have the common sense to introduce himself and congradulate me on my purchase, but instead walked away. I am not sure how you would feel, but I work hard for my money and when I spend over $24K for a vehicle I expect to drive off knowing where my lights are located, how to sync my iPhone to be handsfree (Safety), etc. The sales manager could have texted Steven or better yet, his butt could have answered the phone and he could have assigned another agent to assist the individual waiting like they initally did me (Steven-Bob-Steven).

415,"October 01, 2012",Our sales experience with Ancira Chrysler Jeep Dodge was the absolute one of the best we've ever had.  Its actually my brother and his wife's fault for bringing us up there to look at this one particular Jeep that they looked at initially.  Since they ended up getting a newer one they happened to tell us about Robert and what a great experience they had with him and that we should go talk to him regarding the Jeep we ended up purchasing.....Thanks Tony and Dawn!  oh ya and Robert was great in convincing us that THE BLUE Jeep was the way to go....The wife loves it! ,4.6

417,"September 29, 2012","Dishonest and rude!  Two words I would NEVER associate with USAA.  Why then, would USAA chose to associate itself with Ancira Jeep in San Antonio?

I was in the market for a Jeep and used the USAA car buying service which referred me to Ancira and San Antonio Dodge, Chrysler, Jeep. 

I communicated with Mr David Sullivan at Ancira and reached a tentative agreement to purchase a 2013 Jeep Wrangler.  He quoted me a price plus ""TTL"" (tax, title & license).  When I arrived for our pre-arranged appointment he turned me over to another sales adviser (something I find disrespectful...didn't we agree to meet at 4:30?) that worked up the paperwork.

The purchase order included a $150 document fee and a $150 anti-theft fee.  When I questioned the fees, I was told that they are non-negotiable and included in every deal.  The sales adviser none the less checked with his manager twice and I could clearly hear the manger say, ""tell him everyone pays them!""  I refused and left. 

For comparison, I just purchased a BMW from BMW of San Antonio and paid a $50 document fee so I would have been ok with the same.  But $150?  Can you say ""dealer profit?""  So the""anti-theft"" is the one I had a real beef with.  That's nothing but a sly way to bleed an additional $150 from their customers.  I just don't get it???  They lost me as a potential life-long customer for $150. 

I have absolute trust and confidence in USAA, but this experience has created some doubt in their ability to outsource the ""USAA brand""; USAA and Ancira are not in the same league...not in the same ball park and certainly not on the same team. 

The silver lining?  I went to San Antonio Dodge, Chrysler, Jeep.  Got the same car (different color) for less ($500 under invoice &&&& the military rebate) and was treated with respect.  

One final point...without a doubt the most depressing dealership I've ever visited.  The cubicle farm is quite 1985'ish and does not create a pleasant shopping environment.  I've been to dentist offices that are more uplifting.   

So in summary, complete waste of my time.  I haven't been treated so rudely in quite some time...thank you Ancira (insert thumbs up here!)

Our sales associate was such an easy going, no pressure kind of guy that the entire process seemed effortless. He went out of his way to find exactly what we wanted and never made us feel as though we should take what was already on the lot. Most salesmen would've jumped ship and moved on to other customers and slam dunk sales; but not Robert. He worked for nearly 2 weeks until finding the ""perfect new Jeep for Momma"". She just loves her ""Jackie"" and even stops by to show her off to Robert from time to time!

You pick a vehicle that you end up falling in love with and then you are taken into the office of doom, the office of yes or no, the financing office.  This is the part where you get told (as nice as possible) ""your credit is not up to par or your credit is not usable and we need a few thousand dollars in order to get you in the vehicle"".  At this point you walk the walk of shame to your clunker that has been nothing but trouble and a money pit, shoulders down, and then hope that the car lasts one more year till you can save money for a vehicle that you can love and be proud of.

Cody was great, not your typical ""pushy"" salesman. He was knowledgeable w/ Jeep b/c he owned one. We were allowed to test drive a jeep w/ the top down, which was great. We then got to business on what we wanted. The model wasn't available at this lot, but was in Oklahoma! Cody was great in letting us know all our options and by comparing the model they had available wasn't much of a difference AND it was cheaper! When we arrived at the financing department w/ Michelle Dehoyos our experience was even better! She was just awesome, VERY knowledgeable and an expert in what she does! She kindly offered us to see if we'd be interested in trying financing w/ Ancira. We thought it over and so glad we did! We were approved for an even better percentage rate and cheaper insurance and warranty plan!!! Ancira offered us a deal we couldn't refuse!!! The atmosphere there on the lot was exciting; several employees asked if we needed help when we were waiting to see Michelle in financing. They even had free water and free hot dogs that day. Whatever management is doing, keep it up! We loved our experience here and will definitely be referring others to this Ancira team!!! AND we are loving our new JEEP!!!",5.0

I had never purchased a vehicle before and was a little apprehensive about the whole process, but Mr. Marte made the experience as painless as possible. He was willing to work with me to make sure he knew what I wanted in terms of a vehicle and a price. I gave him plenty of opportunities to take advantage of the fact that I had very little car buying experience but he treated me fairly and was honest about the whole process.",4.8

They didn't have exactly what we wanted but Robert made suggestions/changes to get the jeep the way I wanted it.  We live in Midland, so going back to San Antonio for the extras we added isn't exactly ideal.  Robert told us Ancira would bring us a loaner car once all of the parts we ordered were in and then bring it back to us when it was ready!  Can't wait to have it all completed!",4.8

449,"August 30, 2012","Cody worked really hard to find a vehicle for me over several days time.  Finally, he found a couple choices for me and I went down to San Antonio from Austin to pick out the car.  I had already been approved financing and just needed to pick the car and sign the paperwork.

I can't express enough how great Cody was with me.  Patient, hardworking, funny and very helpful!  This was the first time I was buying a car on my own and was really nervous about it - but Cody stayed with me until I went into financing keeping me company and cracking jokes to help with my nervousness.

I was very pleased with everything until I got into finance.  Then the guy was fairly phoney and immediately he gave me an interest rate 2 points higher than what I had been originally approved for before I got there. He tried to play it off by saying that it must be because the car I finally chose was older - it was actually several years newer. Then he said that it must be from a different finance company...but it wasn't. Then he said he had no control over the interest rate. Well that wasn't quite true either.   I found Cody and he fixed that problem. Then the finance guy wouldn't take no for an answer when he was ""selling"" me all the warranty plans.  None of them was better than the warrantly currently on the car and between that and my very good insurance coverage I explained I didn't need any of those plans. He was not happy.

Finally then I paid my $10,000 down payment, signed everything and when I walked out of the office, there was Cody to take me to my new car!  A full tank of gas, a nicely cleaned car, a cool key ring and then Cody went over everything about the car with me again.  Making sure I knew how to use everything in the car, showing me where the spare tire was and other things I would have never thought to ask!

A couple days later I found out that the terms of my financing suddenly changed to less months and a higher payment.  I really wonder if the finance guy had anything to do with that!  I mean why would they approve it over the computer and then it suddenly changes?????!!!! 

I have now gotten my own financing - at a lower interest rate by a full point and lower payments, the same time period of 72 months and still no co-signer.  And I didn't have one lick of problem with that financing person....sure makes a person wonder.  Maybe you ought see if this guy screwed with my financing because I wouldn't sign up for all the extra warranty stuff.....

Overall, I would always recommend Cody Rokahr - I will follow him whether he moves to another dealership or not in the future. Never will ever go through your financing guy again tho....and I will tell others that too.

By far, the best and most prompt service was shown by Ancira Chrysler Jeep Dodge Ram and specifically,David P Sullivan.  He took me and inquiries very seriously from the beginning and made me feel as if my business was just as important as the customer sitting in the dealership. I am in NJ, and they were willing to work with me to complete the sale and get my jeep shipped to me without even stepping foot in the dealership. 
He answered every question and found answers for those he didn't know off hand.  In the end my car buyer backed out and I regretfully had to hold off on purchasing my Jeep from David and Ancira, but I will be sure to contact them first when I am back in the market. With prices like theirs and the quality of people they employee, I'd be foolish to go anywhere else.  

Thanks David.....

Our conversation turned to what application I was planning to use the vehicle for.  He understood what I was looking for and explained about the improvements that were made this year over the Prior year Wranglers.  He did this while we were moving amongst the vehicles present.  He did not try to up sell me and complimented me on my reasoning for the vehicle options I was looking for.

Karsten was very knowledgeable  about the vehicle he was selling and very friendly.  I highly recommend Karsten  to anyone looking for a new Jeep Wrangler.

While awaiting for the credit to go through he took me on a tour of the service dept.

465,"August 12, 2012","I had a pretty good experience with Ancira, even though my expectations were low. My sales consultant was Andrew Globe, a young man from Michigan State University home for the summer and working hard to pay that MSU tuition. Andrew was a pleasure to deal with and even ordered me an extra key since my Jeep only came with one. 

The only negative was my experience with the Sales Manager who tried to play hardball on the price of the new vehicle. He pretended like he was giving me a better deal because I was a USAA member, but the price he tried to give me was the same as what was on the website. Then when I questioned that he became very defensive and aggressive, a technique that obviously works on some people. At one point he even said ""I don't have to sell you the car"". Well I don't have to buy it either.

Anyway, overall the experience was great and I enjoyed buying a car from Andrew.  He has a great attitude. ",5.0

468,"August 09, 2012","Went to the Ancira dealership first since all my previous vehicles have been from Ancira and was hoping to get a real good deal because of that. I went on a Sunday evening about an hour before closing and was greeted by sales rep Steven Marte. He was very professional and overall did a really nice job trying to sell me a vehicle. I can honestly say I got alot more honesty from him then from previous sales reps from previous purchases. Of course I had no intentions on walking away with a new car that day but wanted to get an idea of how much the new 2012 dodge chargers cost and the value that came with the car. Wasn't a surprise that the numbers couldn't add up to my favor that night, but Steven continued to keep in touch throughout that week and eventually Ancira CJD met me half way and threw a number on the table I couldn't say no to! All and all I was very happy that my business stayed within Ancira because with all the vehicles I purchased, I've always felt that I left the dealership with a fair price and a heck of a deal. For those people interested in the new 2012 dodge chargers, you definitely need to stop by Ancira CJD.

476,"July 29, 2012","This dealership was very friendly and determined to make a sale, but not in that pushy hurry up and buy manner. When I first went down to the dealership(by appointment) Trey told me that I had been approved with no cash down for a different vehicle than what I asked for. I advised him that this was not what I wanted, he then began to check through their inventory list looking for the automatic Mazda 3 that I wanted. We began to look around thru the dealer lot, but all the Mazda 3's were manual. We then passed by the 2009 Ford Fusion that he had me approved for. Trey stated that we could test drive that car while he has another associate search for the Mazda 3. I was very hesitant, but in frustration and disappointment I agreed to drive the car. Upon entering the car, I was silently amazed by the look and feel of the car(which has aux, USB, bluetooth, and moon roof). Being the tech savvy person that I am, I was sold on this car features. I took off in the car and loved the engines small roar as well as the performance this car provided, I was no longer interested in the Mazda 3. We went back to the office and began to process paper work. The process was somewhat long, but no longer than expected for a car purchase. I can not stress enough how great of an employee Trey was.

482,"July 22, 2012","I bought my 2010 Dodge Charger SXT last year in August. I had a good experience with the sales team. I even interacted with the used car sales manager. He gave me a great deal and I really appreciated that but I feel that getting a deal cost me more in the future. We closed the deal real late at night, I asked for the car to be waxed/washed to which I was told, it was washed a few days ago. The windshield had a lot of what I thought was bug crap or sticky thing from trees, Reggie Miller told me to take it to a detail specialist and ask for ""steel wool"" treatment. It will come right off. I found out later that the windshield had tiny tiny chips on the entire windshield, not dirt. Car had 40+k miles and was driven to Texas from a different state. Same thing with the front bumper, head lights and the hood but that I wasn't too overly worried about. When I asked Reggie about this particular issue before driving it home, again I was told that I needed to be washed. The back bumper was loose, so the car would drift on the highway. They thought it a realignment issue. The breaks were bad, they tried to fix that. The car stutters when in reverse, I was told its because itsa heavy car. Break still makes noise a year after I bought it. The back bumper still keeps coming loose. Just got it fixed again yesterday. If a general manager is going to read this, please check my records so that you know I'm not exaggerating. I was told, ""you can't get everything when you get a deal like this."" I left messages for the manager, never got any responses. Reggie Miller said its not going to happen, just replace the windshield: $1,000+. The great experience turned into a crappy one. I still go back to ANCIRA for all my service because of Tony. Incredible customer service, he knew my situation. Always helped me out, where as Perry, he did what he was trained to do and by the book. I don't blame him. There was a lot of stuff wrong with the car and still is. I got so fed up with calling that I gave up. But that windshield is too messed up for me to stop paying attention. Even some of the racing stripes were coming off.

485,"July 13, 2012","Bruce did a great job helping my wife and I find exactly what we were looking for.  He went out of his way to find the jeep with the custom options we were looking for.  I was very picky about what I wanted because I was purchasing a vehicle worth around 40k.  He found the jeep with every option I asked for and that didn't have the options I didn't want.  He promised he would find it in one day, and he did.  After he found it and we came in to agree to purchase the vehicle the other dealer had, he had the car at the dealer in less than 48 hours as he had promised.  Finally when the jeep came in, I was really sick and couldn't come pick it up that day, he offered to bring it to my house.  I told him I would just come in the following day.  When I came to pick up the vehicle and close the deal, he went over everything on the vehicle in great detail.  He even synced both our phones up to the blue tooth and gave a run down of the important features we needed to be aware of from day one.  

On a side note his sales manager Michael, was really nice too.  They really made a great deal by staying within my price range.  He did a great job negotiating the dealer trade to get the jeep from one dealer to another.  I'm glad he did this, as I didn't want to have to take my Jeep in for service at a dealership out of town.  

Also the people we worked with that processed our payment were nice about not being pushy to sell us the extended warranty which I wasn't interested.  They did offer it, and explained the coverage, but never once pushed to sell it.  At the last dealership I bought my previous car at, the finance guy was a nightmare.

All the smaller dealerships who I thought I had a chance of obtaining a vehicle were either being too picky on their criteria, or trying to sell me a vehicle that I absolutely was not happy with and charging me a rediculous down payment.

I am a hard working American who fell on bad times when the economy fell and I thank God for Ancira who understands and helps people, as myself, with credit issues.

498,"June 15, 2012","Bought a Chevy Camaro back in November and I was looking to trade it in for some thing more pratical. After shopping around at Southside Ford, Northside Ford, Ancira Ford, Red Mccombs Ford, Freedom Chevy, & Vara, I thought I had found what I was looking for but many of these dealerships must have thought that my Chevy Camaro was a two cynl vehcile and the trade in value was not good. After several looks at Ancira Dodge, I was introduced to a young gentlmen by the name of Cody, you could tell he was fresh blood and realyy wasn't that experienced but he held his own ground and was able to keep on standing after dealing with me. I appreciate his e-mails in trying to make the deal of a dodge charger happen and he wasn't being pushy like most salesperson are. in the end, we were able to walk out of the dealership with a new dodge charger and I thank you Cody for having the patience with me. My only two complaints, when siging the paperwork, the girl preparing our document was very pushy with all kinds of other options and my wife and I nearly walked out beacuse of that...DONT TRY TO SELL PEOPLE OPTIONS WITH GAP AND OTHER USELESS THINGS! Second one, when I purchased my Camrao from Ancria Chevy (Thank you John LLanes) they reallty detailed the heck out of my Camaro, I guess I was use to the Chevy dearlship and I was expecting the same tretment with my Charger, I was really dissapointed with how they washed and cleaned my car...you can tell they didnt really care to attend to it! So I got up early this morning and I washed, & cleaned it the way it should have been done! So any ways, way to go Cody and thank you for my new Dodge Charger!

In going through the USAA car buying service, I expected to get a good deal on a vehicle, but Robert exceeded my expectations every step of the way, even with the high standards that I know USAA has for service.  He did a great job of explaining things regarding the warranty that I was confused on as well.  PJ did a wonderful job in explaining the relationship & pricing through the USAA car buying service, which allowed me to feel confident in the deal I was getting on the sales price.

He and his peers went out of their way to help me find the best financing available which I would think was quite a task for someone with credit issues that I have.

517,"March 28, 2012","We were dealing with four different dealerships to get the vehicle we wanted to the specs we wanted. Jeff was one of the salesman we were dealing with. As we went through the process no other dealership or salesman worked as hard to keep our business. We were buying a new Jeep and the other dealers were just not helpful with fulfilling our wishes. Jeff Kaupert went out of his way and took his off time to work on this deal for us and made it happen. 
Jeff followed up by even helping me out with some after sales items we wanted to get done with the jeep. 
We left our garage door opener in the trade and he offered to bring it to us on the other side of town.

His expertise and his excitement for the products that he sells kept me engaged the entire time.  He did not pressure me at all and even went the extra mile to research and find potential models for me to consider.  He encouraged me to do my research and answered every question I had.  I went to other dealerships to compare prices and I came right back to Ancira.  The sales team and the finance team worked with me every step of the way and I never once felt disrespected.  The staff is friendly and the prices are fair.  If you are in the market for a new or pre-owned car, go see Robert McConkey.

532,"December 01, 2011","Had a good experience becasue the dealership was well stocked with the types of vehicles I needed to test drive, and it had the car I wanted. The dealership provided me a fair price, and explained everything very well.

I have to commend my sales person, Domingo Duenas.  Domingo was extreamely helpful in scheduling test drives, and finding the vehicle I was interested in. He was very knowledgable about the details of various vehicles, and he went out of his way to ensure my experience as a customer was as good as it gets. His communications with me via phone and text messaging was very quick. I would recommend my family and friends to Domingo without reservation.

This is my first Dodge car I've purchased, so if the vehicle proves to be a quality product, then Ancira and Domingo can expect my return business.

The reason I give a #4 on the Price is because of a Window Etching cost that was included 'after' we agreed on the price of the vehicle. If Ancira is going to sell a security feature, then it should be in the agreed upon sales price, not as an itemized cost after the fact.

540,"November 21, 2011","This was my worst experience ever buying a car.  I have never paid msrp for a vehicle ever.  I went in asking to pay 21-22k for a 2012 new jeep wrangler.  I was clear that was all I wanted to pay and if they couldn't do that as msrp is 25k then we could save each other some time. The salesman talked to finance and they said I should go for a test drive.  When we came back the salesman had me sign a form saying that if I got my price, then I would buy that night.  I had no problem with it.  They then gave me a menu of prices.  They tried to decrease my payments over a longer period of time which would have still got them msrp or more.  I said no.

The salesman went back and forth with finance and then had me sign another form with 25k listed again.  I said why do you keep writing that number down. He said don't worry it will change later they just have to put that number down so he can get it past the owner and that isn't the price and it will change. At this point, I felt like I needed a shower as this felt like a very dirty deal.

They then trotted out more new numbers.  At this point I wasn't sure when the number would change to the 21-22k. Long story short it never did.  I think I got about 700 dollars off msrp after they claimed they are only making 350 dollars on the deal and that they had to make sure the owner didn't see the paperwork.  I don't think the owner would be that upset considering they then advertised a sales event five days later.

He listened to exactly what I was looking for, what I could afford, and then amazingly enough - showed me exactly what I wanted respectfully. I was also taken care of very well with my trade in. Juan made sure that I got what I had asked for (after careful research online) for my trade in and didn't low ball me like many dealerships do. He not only put me into the vehicle I wanted, but it was better than I had asked for: newer, lower mileage, the color, and certified. He really took care of me and treated me like a valued customer, dare I say, he treated me as if I were family.
I can't say enough good things about Juan and Ancira.
When I went back the next day to pick up my awesomely new car, I complimented him through his manager and his manager, as well, was just as amazing.
Thanks, again for the service and I will be returning again for my next car when that happens.

548,"May 03, 2011","I feel like I am a very unlikely person to leave a review for a car dealer, much less leaving all 5s in the ratings. I have not had very good luck with dealers in the past. I am sure that much of it is my fault - I can get a little crabby when things don't go my way.

This time I did it a little different - I knew exactly what I wanted - model, options, color, price. I just had to find it and make a deal. Web searches took me to Ancira with its huge Jeep inventory. After checking their website for a couple of weeks, the Jeep I had been looking for came into their lot.

I contacted the internet sales department via the Ancira website. I got hooked up with the very pleasant and helpful Paul Knoblock. I had a lot of questions via email, which he quickly answered, and talked to him on the phone a couple of times. When I decided that was the Jeep I wanted, I had him get things going.

Paul worked with my bank to get all of the financing taken care of, and promised to have the vehicle ready when we got there. When we arrived at the dealership, we met Paul, who introduced us to salesman Jay Awashra. Jay took charge of the sale, and treated us like arriving dignitaries. Jay had everything lined up for us for a clean, seamless sale transaction. Everything was exactly as they said it would be. Jay talked about some options that were available to us, but we never felt pressured. After Jay showed us our new Jeep - which was fully prepped and ready to go, we signed papers and were driving home before we knew it!

When I am in the market for a new vehicle, my first contact will be Paul and Jay at Ancira. The whole experience was really too good to be true - find exactly what I want, go in and be treated like a VIP, drive away. Thanks!",5.0

550,"April 12, 2011","Searching for a new vehicle can be very labor intensive and not very pleasant as most salesmen, of course, want to make a sale as this is their income, naturally.  Sufian, allowed my husband and I to take our time, no pressure involved.  He was always smiling and if it hadn't been for his manager Bill, calling us after we had visited on a Friday, that the dealership wouldn't be open on a Saturday, we would have probably purchased elsewhere.  I'm so glad we bought from Ancira - first rate place!!  EVERYONE had a smile on their face and you could tell they enjoyed their job - the smile was infectious. Thanks for the great experience!!  Sufian certainly deserves all the plaques on his wall!!",4.8

557,"January 28, 2011","Ancira was a great dealership that I've dealt with in looking for a new car. The dealership did so much just to satisy my needs. The salesmen were very friendly, informative, and negotiable. I very much appreciate everything they did for me. I most definitely would recommend this dealership to my friends and family. ",4.6
558,"November 16, 2010","My experience started with the internet staff and was pleasant the entire way through.  This has been the easiest and best auto purchase experience of my life!  This dealership is no pressure, no hassle and I didn't have to talk to 10 different people to get what I needed.

My original point of contact was Mark Almazan through the internet and then John Coronado worked with me until I got to the dealership where he set me up with a sales rep to work me through the process.  I had already selected several models online within my price range and was ready to see them in person.

I drove away yesterday with a new 2011 Wrangler and am very happy with my purchase.  Juan Gomez is a top notch, no fluff sales person.  He made me feel comfortable and welcome and did a great job with me.  I didn't feel like he was pulling any sales tricks on me and he was honest and straight to the point about my situation due to down payment, credit and ability to be financed.  He was very helpful in assisting me in my choice of vehicle and knowledgeable in the Jeep lineup.

Of all of the auto purchasing experiences in my life, this was the best by far!  I was in and out of there in no time.  I didn't feel tricked or misled and everyone I encountered in the dealership was professional and courteous, right down to the receptionist.

Working with Geronimo in finance was very pleasant.  He too is a step above the rest and was very personable.  I believe that all of the staff that I worked with are assets to your company and I will continue to bring my future business to you.

I didn't feel like I was being pressured and no one tried to sell me a vehicle I didn't want.  The staff are not the typical shifty sales people that I've seen at new and used lots across the country.  Everyone is professional and a tremendous credit to the industry.

If you want a friendly atmosphere where staff are attentive to your needs and wishes, Ancira Chrysler Jeep Dodge Ram is the place to go!  The have a huge selection of new and pre-owned vehicles to choose from and if they can make a deal with me, they can work a deal with anyone!

Thanks again,

559,"September 01, 2010","Overall my experience was great. I visited the dealership three times before buying and spoke with Nathan each time. He was very patient with me while I decided which Ram I wanted. Very little pressure. He was very responsive to emails and got me a great deal on both the truck and my trade. The financing dept was the only reason I didn't rate all 5s. High pressure there, and what I feel was some dishonesty regarding rates, refinancing, and coverage on the factory warranty. I would recommend doing your homework in those areas before buying.",4.6
560,"August 01, 2010","I would recommend this dealership anyone.   But I think that the professional atmosphere is so friendly and inviting.  No pressure and very knowledgable staff.  Bought a Jeep Wrangler Unlimited and they treated me right.

561,"May 20, 2010","I usually do not like purchasing new vehicles just for the simple fact that after dealing with the salesperson, sales manager etc. it leaves me spent.  This is definitely not the case this go around.  It was THE most pleasurable expirience I have had purchasing a new vehicle.  The sales person, Laura, that I dealt with was awesome. She was willing to help me out in every way possible, INCLUDING HAVING SOMEONE AVAILABLE AT THE DEALERSHIP FOR ME TO PICK UP MY NEW TRUCK ON A DAY THAT THEY WOULD NORMALLY BE CLOSED. From start to finish, A+++. I was recommending the dealership to a friend just hours after I picked up my truck.

I live 3 hours away from the dealership and wondered if I had made the right decision going this far to buy my truck...I now realize that Laura and Ancira will go farther to make sure it's done right. OUTSTANDING!!!!!!",5.0

Carlos is an outstanding sales person, very professional and knowledgeable about the product. Trent in Finance was very professional taking care of my loan. The great thing about Ancira Jeep is that they were willing to work with me without any pressure. This my second car from the same dealership and the experience keeps getting better.

563,"April 02, 2010","I'm looking for a used 4WD RAM 2500-equivalent to use on my ranch. I found one advertised on the Ancira Dodge website. It was listed as a 2008 DODGE RAM 2500 QUAD CAB 4X4 WITH A 6.7 LITER CUMMINS DIESEL ENGINE (Stock Number: D544169X; VIN: 	3D7KR28AX8G14556).  It was advertised at $28,998.00, and was said to be a Laramie.  This was a very good price.  However, when I called about the vehicle (29 March) I was told the website was in error...it wasn't a Laramie (I should've known...too good to be true).  I came anyway on 2 April (after returning from a business trip), since I really need a 4X4, and I've heard that Dodge is THE vehicle to have, especially with a Cummins diesel.  I've always been a Ford & Toyota truck man...I was willing to try something new, if the price is right.  

Anyway, when a salesman showed it to me, it turned out that it not only wasn't a Laramie, but wasn't even a 4WD. Then he began telling me about another one they have for $5,000 more (of course, that was negotiable).  I told him I was no longer interested.  Who knows what else is incorrect on the web listing? NOTE: I don't hold the sales personnel responsible for this.  This is the fault of whoever is responsible for posting accurate information on the website (although one would think that having the error pointed out on 29 March would've been sufficient time to correct the error and verify the accuracy of the rest of the info).  

I told the salesman I could understand one mistake, but two seemed a bit too much -- like the listing was meant to entice people there in order to show them something more expensive.  I'm sure that's not the reason, but it sure felt that way.  

I was really interested in a Dodge truck (a new experience for me) but don't care for the uncertainty that's now associated with the web listings here.  I can buy a brand new Tundra, with everything I want (except the diesel engine) for $34,000.  ",3.0
564,"April 01, 2010","Having been a loyal Fiesta Dodge client in the past, when they closed I was reluctant to visit a new dealership for any new vehicle, thinking I would get the typical ""female"" runaround as I did long ago before my Fiesta Dodge experience.  I had recently been using the Ancira Dodge service department because my former service representative Paul Carter was now at this dealership and I felt I could trust this department because I trusted Paul.

Low and behold, when I got there I found out that all the people I dealt with at Fiesta Dodge were now at Ancira Dodge.  What was going to be a very stressful situation to my daughter and I was made so easy by having my prior salesperson there (Paul Knoblock) and the salesmanager from the prior dealership (Kevin Whitchurch)there.  Having dealt with these people before, they knew I was serious about the purchase.  As in the past they knew I was not one to dicker over the price to negotiate the deal, and even though the vehicle I wanted was not on the lot, they worked to get the exact vehicle I wanted for me within the confines of my budget limitation.

There is a comfort in knowing you can walk in a dealership, be greeted by name, know you can trust whom you are dealing with and feeling satisfied when you walk out that you were treated with respect and that they appreciated you as a customer.  Ancira Dodge, because of these two gentleman, have earned both my daughter's and my business from now on.  By the way, we purchased two Dodge Journey vehicles within three days of each other and could not be more satisfied.

569,"February 10, 2010","We arrived at the dealership late in the evening the day after Thanksgiving looking for a new truck to trade my Jeep in for.  We were soon greeted by Jordan who helped us narrow down our search.  At no time did we ever feel pressured or bothered by her.  She was very friendly and not the least bit pushy (which is exactly the opposite of the way we had been treated by other salesmen at other dealers).  She was very knowledgeable about the inventory, and during the test drive, she clearly explained many of the truck's features.  After agreeing to purchase the truck, she took the truck around to the back and cleaned it herself since the make-ready guys were already gone.  Although she did a great job, she offered us a free car wash if we felt it needed it.  We declined.
A few days after the sale, Jordan called us to be sure we were enjoying the truck and were not having any issues with it.  Her level of service and enthusiasm was greatly appreciated.  I would have written this review sooner, but I misplaced the web address.
I have recommended Jordan to several people, but do not believe they have made thier way to the dealership.

After being there for two hours I finally was told that they would give me 3500 for my trade! I used the Kelly Blue book on the www.jeep.com web site and it said I should get 5500 on the low end. I felt low balled then it felt as if Mr. Gomez was stunned that I was upset.  I feel that if a Jeep dealer is not going to honor what is on the Jeep site it needs to be removed.  I enjoyed working with their on line staff but when I got there the salesmen (Mr. Gomez) was worthless.

I was greeted by Nate who really showed me what I was most interested in. We took a test drive and again he pointed out certain items and how to use them that I wasn't aware of. We went into the dealership to get the final dollar amount and again I figure here it comes ""the hidden cost"".

I actually had already gone into visit several of these dealers and the games seemed to increase although they had stated by email / phone that I needed to come in to get their best price (which I never did).  They wasted a lot of my time (& family's time) when I had check in hand and was ready to buy.

So when I did contact Ancira I knew the exact model and price I would pay (I had previously offered same to other dealers first as they also had same exact model and options).  Ancira readily accepted my price and quote by email w/ a confirmation of all (while other dealers would not commit until I came in which I said I would not do until I had confirmation by email due to my distance to drive.

I specifically told them that I had only a couple of days left on my third party warranty and that I wanted to make sure it was taken care of before it expired.  After sitting in their service department until AFTER the expiration date, I was told the car was ready.  Well as soon as I paid for the repair and left the dealership, I heard the same knock.  I returned the car and left it with them again for a couple more days.  After I picked up the car the second time (and paid for a tie rod end and alignment), the same knock was still there.  Well I finally got angry and called the service manager who said that she was going out of town and to drop the car off again.  They replaced an engine mount without charging me and I thought the problem was finally fixed.  Although I paid around $400.00 when it was all said and done, I thought to myself that at least the problem is fixed.  Guess what?  The same damn knock is still there and I will never take my car there again despite the fact that I live very close to this dealership.
