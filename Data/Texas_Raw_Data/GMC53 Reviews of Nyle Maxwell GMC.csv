1,"February 22, 2020",Jeff helped us out this evening and was so very helpful. Buying a car can be a painful process and he made it so easy despite the few humps we ran into with trying to finance. He definitely took a difficult situation and made it bearable for all of us. He took his time to explain everything into detail and make sure we understood and knew what we were waiting on. We were there late but he hung out and just sat and visited with us while we waited and it made the time pass much quicker. We appreciate all that Jeff did and would recommend him to all of our friends looking to buy a car! A great experience overall!!,5.0

3,"November 07, 2018","I give them a full 5 stars because Martin was honest, understanding, patient, and genuinely a great guy. Me and my family have so far purchased 3 vehicles from this dealership and will always recommend them due to the experiences and personnell. Donna who helped with the financial paperwork. She was very informative and knew a lot about the 2018 ram 2500 Tradesman Crew Cab I had purchased. Katherine in service was also very kind and informative of any questions or concerns I had.",4.8
4,"May 07, 2018","No rating for this company because they are terrible.

I bought my GMC ACADIA 2015 SLT mid year 2015 with ALL warranty.

I used Covert to get my oil changed a couple of times and it was okay service. Not outstanding my any means. They always seem busy and too many cars to take care of, but now I realize it is probably because GMC has soooooo many problems with their vehicles. 

I sent my GMC Acadia twice when I was having trouble with the AC Cooling. It was blowing out hot air too much of the time.

They never did respond tell me what the problem was or fix it and it is still blowing out hot air!!!

We told them when we brought it in May 4, 2018 that it seemed there was a problem with the transmission and they still have not said anything about it!

The car has 43,000 mi and is blowing smoke out of the hood. I find out that it is a cracked radiator after I was contacted 2.5 days later and they will not replace it under warranty!!!

I have 36,009 warranty OR expiration 6/2/2018 and 60,000 mi warranty OR expiration 6/2/2020 for anything having to do with engine that does not allow the vehicle to drive.  Obviously, the vehicle cannot be driven with a cracked radiator.

I have read several reviews by others owning a GMC and they are reporting the same thing. Problems with their vehicle, and no help to fix it even under warranty.

GMC does not tell the truth about when they will contact you about your vehicle. Once they finally do contact you about the problem, they won't fix the car without money $$$. Well, I am still paying on my car $525 per month and they should be making sure it runs properly.

I am a grandma without help through my warranty!!!

5,"February 21, 2018","Our salesperson , Bryan Unger, was unlike any we have had before - and we‚Äôve been through the process of looking/buying a vehicle many times. He was AMAZING! Not the typical ‚Äúsalesman‚Äù - he was genuine, honest, kind and professional. He spoke highly of working for Nyle Maxwell and his pride and passion for his job shows! Every employee we encountered was polite and professional (NOT pushy, interrogative or condescending - as we have experienced so many times before). Honorable mentions are the finance manager, Alex Munoz, and the Jeep guru, Rocket, who had extensive knowledge regarding our new vehicle and took the time to show us all the features, etc. Also, Nyle Maxwell has a ‚ÄúForever Lifetime Protection‚Äù that‚Äôs included on almost all their pre-owned vehicles - unlike most of their competitors, they guarantee the engine and transmission FOREVER! Go buy your next vehicle at Nyle Maxwell, you won‚Äôt be disappointed! üëçüëç",5.0
6,"February 20, 2017","Drove down from DFW to pick up a used truck.  It was a great experience, and Matthew was a very organized and professional salesperson that listened well to what our needs were in the week leading up to the purchase.  Thanks also to Donna in the finance department.  Nice doing business with people like y'all!",5.0
7,"January 23, 2017","We went in to the dealership just to look around. Joel met us outside. He asked what we wanted and set to work finding a vehicle that was just right for our family. Every person we came in contact with was friendly, helpful, and respectful. Other salesmen talked with our children and made us feel welcome. We were overwhelmed with how much they did to help us get in the right vehicle for the right price. Even the finance guy, Alex, was friendly and able to explain everything to us. We felt incredibly welcome and listened to. There was no pressure to purchase at any time. Thank you for making car buying a little less stressful!!  We will be back the next time we need a new car.

9,"June 06, 2016","I was looking for my ""empty-nester-mid-life-sporty-luxury-classy-yet roomy-unique-two-seater"" vehicle.  Unknown to me , that vehicle had arrived just hours before I stopped by Maxwell GMC Round Rock.
Marshall Pantalion is a professional and knowledgeable young salesman who met all the conditions I requested before buying the car from him....and there were quite a few. The only reason for not give  this dealership five stars?---most of my day was waiting on the finance department to conclude a deal I was already preapproved on. I had to miss an entire day of work because of this. 

 I love my Dodge Challenger ---thanks to Marsall Pantalion and the Maxwell staff for getting me my dream car!  ",4.2
10,"November 03, 2015",Janie was very easy to work with - no pressure. Explained everything and answered all questions that I had. Alex (in finance) was great as well - no pressure to buy any extras that I didn't want to purchase. Easy to understand all the terms and paperwork.,5.0

14,"October 27, 2015",Nyle Maxwell's service department personnel are outstanding. My wife and I continue to deal with this dealer after buying our first new car from them in 2004. Our over 11 years of dealing with them is primarily because of their professional and caring employees in the service department.,5.0

Not only did they give me the most possible for my trade-in, but i was also able to work in extra protection for my new sierra (all within my budget) thanks to Alex and Janie! There was absolutely no pressure to buy and overall this was my #1 dealer experience which will have me coming back for anything as well as referring any friends or family.",5.0
18,"September 16, 2015","Our experience was great. This dealership is very friendly and made you feel comfortable with no pressures. The salesman, Tanner, was great. Even though he has only been selling cars for little over 3 weeks he knew everything about the cars & their features. He is going to be a great salesman that people will trust and he has a great personality with honesty.",5.0

The customer waiting area and Wi-Fi are excellent assets and provide additional convenience.",5.0

22,"August 26, 2015",They recognize me and treat me like a valued customer. My Service Writer even recognized that I was in a new truck and asked me about my old truck! The Wi-Fi in the waiting area is a huge plus. It allowed me to get some work done while I was waiting.,5.0

24,"August 13, 2015","I came in because the navigation system was not working. For some reason, my extended warranty would not cover the expense of reprogramming. That did not put me in a wonderful mood but my service rep, Scott, handled the issue professionally and kept me aware of the progress while reprogramming. He even offered to have me driven to a nearby restaurant for lunch. While I was there, even the technician visited with me to keep me updated. The final bill was exactly what I was quoted and I left as a very pleased customer. There is no doubt that I will continue to purchase from your dealership. My respect and thanks go out to Scott.",5.0
25,"August 11, 2015","This was our second GMC purchase this month. My experience was awesome. Tony listened and found what I wanted in a car, Jeff walked me through all of the car's bells and whistles, and Francisco handled financing the easy way. Great teamwork!",5.0
26,"August 11, 2015","Once again the team at Nyle Maxwell GMC hit another home run for us! They worked hard together to get us the deal we needed for the vehicle we wanted. Thanks to all, Janey, Tom, Mark, and Donna! Jeff Simmons",5.0
27,"August 01, 2015",Shane was very patient and put up with my questions and multiple visits and multiple test drives. He didn't pressure me and I enjoyed working with him and talking with him. I would also like to thank Tom Gammon for going out of his way to research extra truck options and provide me with an opportunity to determine if I wanted another truck or not. Tom also returned a Boston music CD that I left in my trade in. That was very kind given it was one of his favorite bands. When I get ready for another vehicle in the family I will stop at your location first. I've talked with my neighbors and they seemed surprised that I could get such good value at Nyle Maxwell GMC. I think things went great. I am not an easy customer given I have to research and think before spending big $. Thanks for a great experience!,5.0
28,"July 28, 2015","Clayton Cunningham did a great job finding us the most bang for the buck. He answered all our questions and explained all the bells and whistles of our new Acadia.

29,"July 27, 2015","Just bought a new Canyon from Nyle Maxwell GMC in Round Rock.  It was the best car buying experience I ever had.  Janie, our salesperson, was tremendous.  She was very knowledgeable and helpful throughout the process.  Her final walk through of the vehicle was outstanding.",5.0
30,"July 23, 2015","As usual, Scot Murray took excellent care of me & my vehicle. Scot & I became acquainted several years ago when I purchased a p/u @ Nyle Maxwell. In the time he has always taken care of my vehicles in a prompt & courteous manner. I am proud to recommend the dealership & Scot to everyone.",5.0
31,"July 22, 2015","My experience with Nyle Maxwell from the beginning when we bought our truck as been fantastic - everyone we dealt with has been friendly & very helpful. When we bring the truck in for regular service it is taken care of quickly with no problems. When we did have an issue with some service it was corrected fully and quickly - I was given a loaner car for the weekend - when I came in to pick up my truck it was washed, vacuumed and running great. I love Nyle Maxwell GMC, Round Rock and will for sure buy if the future.

33,"July 20, 2015",Awesome. Love having this place take care of my truck. It's comforting knowing they are there.  Bought a new truck a couple years ago and they are the only place I'll take it for service.  Fast and friendly are the best way in words to describe it.

36,"May 27, 2015",I always get great service at Nyle Maxwell GMC. I have purchased two vehicles there and Scot Murray is great to work with. He remembers my name every time I come in and makes the service process painless and quick and does not try to sell me extra service that I do not need.,5.0

38,"April 19, 2015","Just wanted to leave my comments on the fantastic job done by the dealership, starting with an after 9:00 PM call from Robert the General Sales Manager as I was looking for a hard to find Canyon.  I had just had a bad experience actually closing a deal on a Canyon locally only to find the dealer trade didn‚Äôt actually happen as I was signing the papers, I didn‚Äôt want a repeat of that situation I explained to Robert and the gang. I live in the Dallas area, so the logistics of this deal were going to be tricky.  They had one that was an almost exact match to what I was looking for. The next day I worked with Toby and Mark getting pictures of a potential trade-in sent off. It was all arranged, I would be coming down Saturday, about a 200 mile trip for me, then due to a misunderstanding, the truck wouldn‚Äôt be available until Monday as it was being displayed at the ballpark. Robert stepped up and offered to deliver the vehicle to me Tuesday. Hey, it wasn‚Äôt ideal, but I talked to Toby and Robert as I was driving the 400 mile round trip to get this deal done and I again reiterated my concerns that the truck would be available for me to close on when I arrived at the dealership.

Well, you guys really got me, I got the call 20 miles from the dealership that you had sold the vehicle. Wow! Excellent job at making me feel like a complete fool and total idiot for trying to conduct a professional business deal with your dealership. A perfect one-two punch of no class and no integrity that I just didn‚Äôt expect to happen and you guys just nailed it! I‚Äôm sure the bunch of you will have some laughs and maybe some high-fives of the next couple of days on my expense. I personally don‚Äôt conduct business in this classless manner, but I guess ownership knows what they‚Äôre doing in Round Rock, TX. ",1.4
39,"March 04, 2015",My requirements for a vehicle were very specific and my time frame was extremely tight. All involved did an outstanding job finding the right vehicle and getting it to me quickly. I've bought numerous vehicles before and am happy to say that my first purchase from the folks at Maxwell was the best experience I've had.,5.0
40,"March 03, 2015","Jeff Schneider was the best sales person ever! Very knowledgeable, friendly and made me feel like part of the family at the Nyle Maxwell Round Rock dealership. He is a big part of the reason I bought my beautiful 2015 GMC Terrain SLT2 Suv. He made the entire process very smooth and made me feel like he cared about my purchasing experience. He should be commended my his management team and also Mark in the finance dept. was wonderful. Worked to get me the best rate. Tom the G.M. also made me feel very welcomed. Everyone at this R. R. dealership is right on the mark, great group to purchase a vehicle from and I will always return for my purchases, keep up the great job folks and thanks for an amazing experience. I drove off the lot Happy and that is what in the end counts, all the best!

41,"March 03, 2015","I came to Nyle Maxwell from their competitor, Don Hewlett. Don Hewlett had refused to program my new remote, see my review on their tab. I came in and Spoke with Mindy, i told her of the situation, that i had custom programming in my truck and needed to get my remote programmed but that i would like a Duramax trained tech to do it since they are usually familiar with the aftermarket type tuning. She said that would be no problem, she wrote down all of my concerns and relayed them directly to the tech. They were able to get my new remote programmed and i was on my way in less than 40 minutes. If i should ever need service in the future i will certainly go here.",4.8

I'm definitely spreading the word and sending people your way. Thank you!",5.0
43,"April 02, 2014","Nyle Maxwell GMC
Loved it
My experience since day 1 when I purchased my 2011 Denali HD has been nothing but the best experience. Buying a vehicle is one thing but the service you receive after the purchase an entirely different experience. Working with Scot Murray my service advisor has always been top notch treatment. I am greeted by him every time. He listens to my needs and addresses them with a plan, a timeline, and keeps updated on a regular basis so that I always have knowledge and clan plan my day knowing when I can pick up my vehicle. I have owned several high vehicles and classics and I am very meticulous about car care and what my expectations are never an issues working with Scot and his team. My truck is returned to me just as I took it in with no issues. In fact it is carefully parked waiting for me in a secured area away from high traffic areas. If you are in the market for not just a GMC but to have the best experience after your purchasing experience see Nyle Maxwell and make sure to have Scot as your service advisor. You will be amazed.",5.0
44,"November 29, 2013",Very condescending and rude talks down to you I went in with a set budget and he told me realistically it couldn't be done and tried talking me into a lease he lost 3 sales that day me and my sister went to another dealership and I bought the next day and she bought today and dad decided to keep what he had guess he should learn some better people skills  his loss I got a better deal elsewhere with more features than the one I was looking at there and a better price not to mention when I test drove one of there cars overnight and left mine with them the next day I came to pick mine up and my key was broken ,1.0
45,"October 16, 2013","Denny was very helpful when I called on the phone about which tires to get. When showed up at dealership he met me outside, got everything he needed from me and said would be ready in few hours; and it was. When checked out, the price was actually lower than what he quoted. What was really nice was seeing a lot of the same faces working there. I hadn't been to the service dept. in at least 2 years and to see the same people still there for that long makes me feel like Maxwell GMC really cares.",5.0
46,"June 19, 2013","My truck quit running around 7pm On Monday and the service dept. was closed. I called the next morning and the service writer gave me the wrecker company for towing my vehicle to the dealership at 7:20am. After calling the wrecker company, they delivered the truck to the dealership by 9am. A courtesy van picked me up to bring me to the dealership where I was able to pick up the truck by 12:45pm. All this occurred on a very rainy morning. I'm very grateful to the personnel involved for their efficiency in getting me back on the road. The follow-up after the repair was the very next day which is a great way to say you care. Thank You !",4.8
47,"January 02, 2013","We tried to purchases car from NM GMC back in 2007, but we could never arrive on a fair price and ended up buying from Gunn GMC in San Antonio.  So fast forward to 2012 and we want to be responsible citizens and shop local and keep our Tax dollars in Round Rock,  so we thought we would give NM GMC another shot.  All started well as we had received a flyer stating that NM GMC wanted our car and would give us approx 20k in trade...knowing that we have had our car serviced here several times and that they know our car we felt it to be a legitimate offer.

We visited the lot and looked at several vehicles and even test drove a model that was similar to what we wanted just not right colors or interior finishes.  we went inside to discuss how we could get the car we wanted.  Then the ""typical car salesman antics started"".  After several rounds of trying to be sold a car...even though we had never agreed to a specific car...as what we wanted did not exist on their lot...but that did not matter...they kept pushing various cars...I guess in hopes we would just cave?  During this time we did allow them to ""verify"" that our car was worth the value as stated on the flyer....Surprise...it was only worth about 12k...big delta from the 20k offer.

When we confronted Chris about the flyer and what we thought to be false advertising he stated the following:
...this is done by a third party marketing firm and we have no control of the info that goes out.
...that everyone does this and that it is just away to get people in the door..it worked here did it not
...the small print on the back covers us if the final value and original offer are different.

Well I am a small businessman here in Round Rock and no matter who does work for us....if it goes out under my companies name that means I stand behind it. And I guess Chris if everyone jumped of a cliff you would follow?  Integrity is standing up and doing what is right no matter what others do. Finally, small print is for people who may have something to hide...and in our case you did.

Upon parting, Chris told us he would get with his manager and let him know of our conversation and get back to us on how to make this right.  Well it has been over two weeks and no contact.  In the meantime we bought a car from Covert in Austin...a much better experience!

48,"July 21, 2012","The entire staff was very helpful, and answered all questionsa honestly and thoroughly.  They took the time to determine what we wanted in a vehicle, including options and helped us get the ""right"" vehicle to fit our needs.  Wonderful experience!",5.0
49,"July 16, 2012","Once again you have delivered above and beyond expectations. What a great family to be a part of.  You tell them what you want and you can bet they will deliver. I purchased a 2012 GMC Sierra from you on 7/4/2012. The experience as always was enjoyable, and no pressure. Other dealers in the area should take note. When you tell someone something, or advertise something, Maxwell family of dealerships leads by example. This made out 7th purchase from the Nyle Maxwell family of dealerships. I told them what I was looking for, they delivered. I told them what I wanted to pay, they delivered. I was able to deal with the same people I have been dealing with over the past few years.
Those that may be considering to buy from Nyle Maxwell, Tom, Mark, Clayton, Louise, Mike, consider this, if these people have been on his staff for several years, it tells you a lot of whom they work for. I can assure you, no other dealer comes anywhere close. These people are (simply put) the best, number one.

50,"December 09, 2011","Four years ago I bought a Sierra 1500 SLT (basically loaded) with the 60 month/100k service contract.  The service contract does not cover much beyond the engine and transmission so you may want to save your money.  The truck has been great for the most part.  Since I bought the truck, the sunroof (factory) has been leaking ever since.  They (Nyle Maxwell) supposedly replaced the seal back in 2007 but it still leaked.  I brought it back and they ""water tested"" it with a hose and said they could not find evidence of a leak.  It still leaks in 2011 after multiple attempts to get them to fix it they want to charge me $105 just to look at it (again)! Now on to the door handles. Both handles on the driver side are loosing paint on the inner part of the exterior handle due to chipping. The response I get from them is oh yeah, that happens.  Really? GMC can't design a door handle that does not chip paint from opening and closing the door?  On to the tail lamp assembly that has a broken seal.  Again, no cracks or external damage but this is not covered under the 60 month/100k warranty which excludes practically everything that can go wrong. Since May 2007 I have been taking this truck to Nyle Maxwell for service on a regular basis and keep this truck in pristine condition.  Besides the mileage, everything else about the truck would appear it is near brand new.  I am absolutely surprised that neither Nyle Maxwell or GMC stand behind the products they sell. If these problems were not defects, I would just replace them and move on but they are obviously making inferior parts on their automobiles. Their service is somewhat friendly but don't expect them do go above and beyond to keep their customers coming back.  I for one, will not be returning to Nyle Maxwell for service or sales in the future. As a final test, I asked the for an estimate on parts and labor for the handles, driver side headlamp assembly, and driver side tail light assembly and will see what they come up with since I have already done the research on-line. Make sure to get everything in writing and if possible record the conversation with Francisco when he sells you the extended coverage because he will lie about what it does and does not cover.",2.5
51,"October 11, 2011","I bought a used car here. That went OK except for a SUPER-LONG wait to sort out the financial part of the process. But when I called our salesman Mario to tell him about some problems with the car a little while later though, I got some of the worst customer service ever. He was so friendly and polite during the sales spiel (surprising!), but the minute he heard about the problems with the car he became defensive. He argued with me about every single point and made it clear that they weren't going to do crap to help me. THEY DO NOT THOROUGHLY INSPECT/REPAIR THE CARS BEFORE SELLING THEM. DO NOT BUY A CAR HERE",1.4
52,"June 28, 2011","I was interested in a used truck I found online. I ended up not buying the truck. The price was probably a bit high. It was discounted after I had decided not to buy the truck. I then looked at a new truck, but they didn't seem to want to deal on it.

All three of the people that I dealt with were nice and seemed helpful. They called back when they said and stayed in contact with me regarding the deal. Fransisco in finance is a hoot! I enjoyed working with him, much more than any other finance experience that I have had.

I would suggest this dealership for several reasons. But make sure you are educated on prices before you go in, that way you can tell what is a good deal and what is not.",3.3
