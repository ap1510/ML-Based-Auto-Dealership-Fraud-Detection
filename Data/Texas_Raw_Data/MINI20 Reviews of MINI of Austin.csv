1,"April 02, 2020","This dealership mistakenly diagnosed a lose in power to carbon build up in the valves when in reality it was a damaged catalytic converter.  They advised me they didn't have the parts to help with carbon build up, and turned me away. 

Based on their diagnosis my only option was to use an aftermarket cleaner since they were unwilling to help.  I used the cleaner and it ended up damaging the already damaged catalytic converter (which should be covered under warranty).  

That cleaning obviously didn't help and i brought the car back in.  They determined it was actually a damaged catalytic converter the whole time, and tried to charge me for it. I didn't have the money and didn't know it should have been covered by the manufacturers warranty.  I didn't have the money to fix it so it has sat in my garage for months. 

I finally paid off the loan and people advised me that this should have been covered.  I reached back out to this dealership for help.  They told me that because i used that cleaner based on their incorrect diagnosis that my warranty was void.  

So to recap i wasted $1200 on parts based on an incorrect diagnosis from them, and voided my warranty based on their incompetent maintenance staff. Now they are taking no responsibility and the car has lost all of its value.

2,"March 02, 2020","I will revise this review if I am somehow mistaken about something, but right now I just don't get it. I won't go into the whole story, but the service was no big deal. Service manager said it should be ready in a couple of days...Friday. Fine. I called Friday, no return call, but they did send a video saying the last shop that did an oil change didn't put in a gasket and it had been leaking some oil, but it had been repaired. OK. I replied and asked when the car might be ready. No response. They were open Saturday. No call. I called again today and left a message and nothing. 

What the xxxx? They just don't return customer calls? They can't take one minute to say the car will be ready/won't be ready? I have an extended service contract with Mini...so I have to go to them for work. Am I just going to be ignored by them for years on end? Do I have to drive to a dealer in another city to get any kind of service

I just do not see how a business can function treating customers this way. I'm not going to name any names.",1.8
3,"December 05, 2019","Posting this review here to help offset some of the negatives. This site is a glaring standout when searching the internet for Mini of Austin (most other sites have amazing reviews).

I initially came into Mini of Austin with my girlfriend who traded in her extremely old and worn down Malibu for a 2017 Hardtop 4-door. 

Damon assisted us with her purchase and again when I returned to buy my own Countryman.

On both occasions, Damon was phenomenal (as was the entire staff here). I've purchased too many cars in the last couple of years, and have had both good and bad experiences. The Mini of Austin experience was amazing.

In both cases, our trade ins were odd. Hers was a beat down Malibu (as mentioned above) so we didn't expect to get much. Damon worked with us and got what we needed to make the deal happen for her. 

My Mustang trade in was a unique package that most dealers ignore when evaluating it. Not this dealer. Jim (think is his name?), the manager, knew what it was and offered me more than any other dealer that had previously looked at it.

These guys obviously care about the customer experience and genuinely love the cars they sell. Thats what matters to me and it's why I bought this car.

There were some small details with the car that needed to be corrected. Some of the badging had fallen off, other trim pieces need to be fixed etc, but I know the dealer will come through for me. I am also a bit more OCD than your average buyer, so take this point with a grain of salt.",4.6
4,"October 26, 2019","I schedulled a service for my wifes Mini Countryman at this service department and after waiting a week for the service date and driving an hour to the dealiership, taking an Uber to work and an Uber back that afternoon, I found they had not even taken a real look at my wifes car.

I was asked what The issue was when I dropped off the car that morning and the paperwork I received showed my words verbatim as the issue. There was no documentation showing any notations from a service maninics inspection of the car. I could also tell by the dust covering bolts that would require removal to access the area that it had not actually been looked at.

The most they may have done would be to have hooked it up to a computer and create a readout of issues with the car but I was not presented even with that. At the end of the day they wanted me to spend money on a very expensive repair that was not required and had reciently been done elsewhere.

My wifes issue with her car was resolved by me spending $68.97 online to purchase a bolt on part and it was that simple.

My overall feeling is that this service department is not ran with a customer first mentality but instead a cash first mentality. My suggestion for others is to steer clear of this service department and instead spend your money with a shop that has experience with Mini Coopers. Your results will be much better.",1.4
5,"August 26, 2019","BAIT AND SWITCH Mini of Austin and Damon Whitmer, sales person at Mini of Austin are not to be trusted!

I contact them regarding a one year old Mini 2018 Countryman in April 2019. It was described as an executive loaded vehicle with all available options. I contacted Mini of Austin and Damon was my salesperson who verified this description

i asked him via email to verify all of the options in the Mini listing were correct and he said YES. I flew to Austin and that's when the problems began.

The car was stripped..had just navigation and a couple singular options versus packages containing the 12 or 13 options that would have loaded the vehicle.

i pointed this out to Damon he sent me to the ""manager"". The manager did not believe my issues with the missing equipment until I repeatedly explained the car was for my wife. I called my wife n his office and her ""hot button "" was the missing power memory seats. After he listened to my wife explain that she would have to think about, it he understood I was not fabricating this story. He offered a $500 discount for their mistake. My wife said go ahead and drive the car home. i accented his offer as I had flown there to but a car my wife wanted. They blamed this on a vendor that decodes VIN numbers. Apparently they do not review the vendors submissions. 

Unfortunately, after I returned home we realized that the DESCRIBED OPTIONS THAT WE DID NOT RECEIVE = $4342.00 vs the $500.00 offered and accepted

THEY SUCCESSFULLY BAITED AND SWITCHED US. RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!!

6,"February 10, 2019","I went to my appointment for a 60,000 mile service and a whistle noise my engine makes in the morning. They wanted to change my spares plugs and flush my brake fluid. My husband told Josh Tibbs that we only want the service and the noise corrected but he was rude and treated us like we were lower than dirt. I have been taking my care there and that was the first time I had someone that rude talk to us in that manner. I left my car and then  turned around at the roundabout and went and got my car. I will not take my car back to this dealership again or buy another Mini Cooper. ",1.2
7,"July 02, 2018","We purchased our special order Mini hardtop from Mini of Austin. Based on our experience, Mini of Austin is the ONLY place that receives our business for maintenance, parts, accessories and tyres. There is no value in investing time searching for the cheapest price on any of the above when best value is always found at Mini of Austin. Correct wiper blades? Check. Specific tyres in stock? Check. Meticulous service? Check. Top notch staff? Check. No additional charges to replace a rear wiper or a bulb? Check. Who even does that?!?",5.0
8,"December 14, 2016",I have owned many cars over the years but never has a single dealership gotten my business three times in a row until now. All three times I've seen Steven for the sale of the new car. He's hard working and is ready with all the important information about the vehicles. The Financial manager Jim always finds me the best deal and Lee Ann is super helpful with training on all the features and accessories of the vehicle. This is a great place to buy a car as they take good care of you both before and after the sale.,5.0
9,"April 27, 2015","Our experience purchasing our new Mini Cooper S was the best car buying event ever. Stephen de los Santos helped us find exactly the car we wanted and walked us through every step with a smile and a great no pressure, collaborative attitude.

After taking the car home we realized we left our garage opener in our trade in and Stephen was amazing and met us to give it to us, saving us a huge headache and at least 2 hours of driving.

Really the best purchase experience that I've ever had",5.0

12,"September 11, 2014",Stephen De Los Santos and everyone else at the dealership that we had the pleasure of meeting provided my wife and I with a wonderful car buying experiece. If I am unable to drive Gertie due to my wife's  refusal to turn over the keys I will enjoy returning  and purchasing another. We have been in business ourselves over the years and can only hope that ours were and  are run as well as Mini of Austin.,5.0
13,"August 24, 2014",After totaling a 2010 MINI just a few months ago I knew I wanted another MINI. They made me feel like part of the MINI family when the same sales and financial reps remembered me the second time around . I am extremely happy with my 2013 MINI Clubman.  ,4.8
14,"August 18, 2014","Dear Mini of Austin,

Just wanted to thank you for the best buying experience that I have ever had! I have purchsed at least a dozen cars in my life, but my experience at Mini of Austin was the best ever!

Special thanks to my sales partner Stephen De Los Santos, so professional, so friendly, so thorough, communicated to me even on his day off, went well above an beyond what I had ever experienced. Also wanted to that Charlie the finance Manager, what a easy quick process!

Oh.....I guess that I should also add that I LOVE LOVE LOVE MY MINI COUNTRYMAN!! 

I look forward to seeing you guys when I visit the dealership!

Many thanks and much gratitude!

15,"March 22, 2014","If you were able to give a rating over ""5"" I would've done it in a heartbeat!! BEST CAR BUYING EXPERIENCE I'VE EVER HAD!! Very relaxed atmosphere & no sales pressure. Everyone went above & beyond making me feel comfortable, they are just decent & caring people. After the horrible experience 2 days previous at Covert Chevrolet on 183 & the unethical salesman I had in Charles Ball, Robert Tyler renewed my faith that there are honest salesmen with integrity. To bad there aren't Robert Tyler's at every dealership!! I also know that if ever I need help with anything on the 2 cars I purchased I wouldn't hesitate calling for assistance & they would be more than happy to help. ",5.0
16,"September 07, 2013",Austin did me right compared to San Antonio Mini.  Austin treated you well and service they provided you with a loner and assistance to make you happy.  San Antonio Mini could use some more customer relations skills. Each time I went to SAM there was problems every one sat on their xxx no one greeted you our made you feel like you were part of the mini family.  If you buy and service go to Austin not San Antonio.,5.0
17,"August 22, 2012","i first talked to art on the phone. he asked for info on my trade in, mileage, payoff, etc. so he could prep for my visit. i ave ne day off but came in his time perimeters to meet. i walk in and he asks if i wanted to drive one (i have owned 3 in the past), no. i am here to buy, make a deal. he had not looked at my email for any pre prepping on getting a deal together. he left for 30 minutes to get a trade in value that was extremely low with no room for negotiation, he said. he quoted me payments without running my credit for an interest rate, and told me it would cost $1200 to transport the mini i wanted to austin. after an hour i was disillusioned that this sales person did not want to help me get a mini at all. i told him i wanted to make a deal but did not want to waste my time (my one day off) or his time. this is when he said, &quot;oh, you're not wasting my time, i am here all day.&quot; which really ended it all for me. i walked out. i was later sent an email reminding me that if i ordered the mini i wanted my car trade in value will continue to drop $500 a month. the next day in 10 minutes over the phone samantha miller at moritz mini in arlington gave me a better trade in, free transport of the car i wanted, and a payment $20 less than i wanted to pay.

18,"November 15, 2011","Vindictive, ugly, no actually mean.  Observe for signs that you have entered into THEIR kingdom, and inspect your Mini for windshield cracks, evidence tools were dropped inside and don't even believe that your concerns will be heard.  Mini of Austin crushes any comments that convey lack of sterling corporate stars.  Look out and be warned.  And---ASK AROUND--you will find plenty of horror stories out there.  Rude peeps.",1.8
19,"June 10, 2011","I work in central Texas but live in a large metro area, and Mini of Austin was not the most convenient dealer, but certainly the most accommodating. Due to work responsibilities, I was unable to visit during their regular working hours, but Art was happy to stay around until I could get there. MOA had an acceptable vehicle and over the next week or so we worked out an ageeable price. Art had the vehicle cleaned and ready to go when I arrived and I was done with the paperwork in 20 minutes or less. And again, Art stayed late to go over the vehicle with me. When we discovered that the visor had been damaged, Art drove to my place of business on his day off to install a new visor. Great customer service and the vehicle is great, too.",5.0
