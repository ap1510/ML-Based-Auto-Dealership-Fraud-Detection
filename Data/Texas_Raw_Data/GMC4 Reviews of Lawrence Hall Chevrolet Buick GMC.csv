2,"December 06, 2010","Joe Smith provided great customer service to me. Took the time to explain all features on 2011 Denal, set up my on star system and look for any additional rebate offers. I drove all the way from San Antonio, Texas to buy this truck and would recommend anyone that wants to buy a car to come to Lawrence Hall and ask for Joe Smith. Great sales person and honest individual.  Thanks for the wonderful car buying experience. Sara G. Vara",5.0
