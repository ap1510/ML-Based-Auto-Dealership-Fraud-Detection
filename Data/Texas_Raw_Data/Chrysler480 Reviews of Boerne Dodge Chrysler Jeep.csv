Alivia our saleswoman couldn't have been any more knowledgeable and up to date on all the different models and trim packages that are offered.

Ram has no intention of repairing anything somehow it's a normal condition or the customer is at fault.Total rip off didn't even wash the truck after it was test dove through road spray.

18,"January 19, 2020","This was the worst car buying experience we have ever had! They advertised one price which is what brought us in to begin with then when it was time to talk numbers the price was, literally no joke, $13K higher! Initially they said it was because the price advertised included all discounts available, which we didn’t qualify for. Honestly, I don’t know anyone who would but ok, I get that. But once you took into account all the discounts, the price was still $6K higher than the sticker price on the car. Which they then told me was due to all the after market additions they put on the car at the dealership. We eventually came to an agreement after several hours of negotiations only to have them try to push additional warranty expense on us after we repeatedly declined. Had one gentleman come in and tell us that they were already losing money on the deal and the warranties are a way they make their money. Seriously, if selling me the car at the price they've agreed upon is a loss, then don’t sell me the car! I can certainly find something else somewhere else! I really am not worried about their profit margin at that point. Perhaps if you’d been upfront with the price to begin with we could have all saved a lot of time and they could have sold the car to someone else willing to pay the price. After my husband got mad and stormed out they finally took no for an answer on the additional warranty and we signed the papers at the negotiated price. Then they came back and apologized stating they hoped this didn’t leave a bad taste in our mouth. I thanked them for the apology but told them unfortunately it was too late for that after all we’d been through. What a horrible experience, never again! ",1.0

41,"November 24, 2019","I test drove a used Ram Friday evening at Boerne Dodge.  Vinnie (salesman) was supposed to get back to me with final numbers on the used Ram. I called Sat morning to check on the numbers. He didn't have them yet. I told him I wanted the truck. He said he had other appointments and to come in at 530 Sat evening. He promised to pull the truck. He texted me around 2 and told me it sold. He wouldn't answer my calls after that. He finally called hours later. He claimed his Manager was to blame. He was holding the keys but the manager took them. ""I did everything I could."" He then had the gall to recommend a new Ram. I asked if the online price was accurate and was told ""yes, except for the dealer addendum"". Apparantly that's only an additional $3000. That's no way to do business. They are crooks! They have lost a customer forever.",1.0

44,"November 17, 2019",Came in on a Ram Mega cab 2500 advertised on the web sight for a misleading Borne Dodge price of $56704. The Borne Doge advertised price does not include the scam APEX or Dealer installed options. Add another $7000 to the $56704 for the real price.

54,"October 05, 2019","Watch Out For ""APEX Scam""!!!!!!
The reason I state to watch out for ""APEX Scam"", I went in to purchase a $19,450 vehicle and left with a $30,000 financed vehicle even after we had agreed at TT&L of $22,800 after they took ""off"" $400 of the APEX GPS tracking system. I had asked if there was anything they could do about the APEX, they stated they could not take it off the vehicle, but would discount it from $1,200 to $800 which was good, and after all the other little fees I was expecting to finance the vehicle around $23,000 - $25,000. It was my fault for not double-checking the about being financed, the about I saw which was $30k, and I thought that was the total I would be paying after the interest was paid too. But it was not until after it hit my credit report that I saw I had financed a $30k vehicle with Boerne Dodge.
So after double checking my documents they charged me $4,000 for the APEX and Apex service fee, and the reason I know this is a complete scam is that I purchased another vehicle with them less than a year ago and only paid the $800 for the APEX. So for them to add $4k to a vehicle and charge me $4k is a complete rip off and scam. I have nothing but complete and utter buyers remorse going with Boerne Dodge Chrysler Jeep Ram.
So my understanding after interacting with you all and after reading a response from them it is that they will sit across the table from a customer look them in the eyes and tell them that the ""APEX"" is $1,200, but offer it at a discount price of $800. Then go behind their back and charge them $4,000 for the ""APEX"" system in all the paperwork. 
I am completely disgusted and have nothing but complete and utter buyers remorse buying from Boerne Dodge Chrysler Jeep Ram.",1.5

67,"September 13, 2019","Had to take my car in due to a recall issue on a simple part to replace. It took 3 days for them to fix, however when they said it was ready and I tried driving the car after turning in my rental, the same issue persisted.
While I was showing the issue to the representative, a hispanic tech came up to the rep and starting talking about some slut girl he wanted to see at work. I then had to wait an additional 30 mins for them to realize what they screwed up on before I finally got my car fixed. The rep gave a half-assed apology, but needless to say I was not convinced nor did I care at that point. This is not my first negative experience with their services, but unfortunately they are the only Dodge dealer near my location to handle recalls. Someone needs to replace the management there.",1.4

93,"July 26, 2019","After spending a day doing a deal with on a Dodge Ram, I get a call at 4:30pm telling me they had sold the truck we had a deal on.  I had completed the deal with the Sales Manager with an appointment to come in and pick up the new truck. Afterwards, I even arraigned my own financing and spent 2 hours getting my trade ready to deliver. My original call was from the Commerce Manager telling me they had sold it. When I talked with the Sales Manager, I was told it was a dealer trade. Well, which was it? Makes me wonder if they're just reneging on the deal because there is no honest way this could have happened. Of course, ""sorry, its the only one we have at that price"" is the answer I got from the Sales Manager, no effort to find me another truck or any thing else. Even though I was extremely upset, I had to snicker when he told me he had no control over the sale/trade of the truck we had a deal on. A Sales Manager having no control over vehicles being sold, I call Bulls**t on that. I've asked 3 differnt people at the dealership for the General Manager's contact information, and all 3 told me ""they couldn't find it. WOW!

Then he made the call and apologized for what had happened explained everything. The only thing I would say when you come here is ask for three people. Sharon, Korbie and Donnie. Korbie no matter what was by far one of the best sales associates I’ve ever worked with. She’s really knowledgeable.

When I arrived at the Service department, there were 3 employees sitting behind the counter. I was never greeted and no one made any attempt to see what I needed. Finally someone offered to help. I told him I needed an oil change and requested a car wash like I had been told. He just seemed to laugh and said ""We don't offer that here"". He asked me who told me that, a saIes person or someone else. I said it was the lady who scheduled my appt. He said "" that was a third party who scheduled you. We don't offer car washes to our customers as we don't have any means to provide them"" In my opinion, he appeared rude.

Here, you get greeted  by one person, and they are relax and make the buying process less stressful. There willing to let you just be and walk around and look at different options and if you want something particular they will grab it for you and let you be. But remain in a reasonable close reach if you had any questions. I will be definitely returning in the future and highly recommended them. It was totally worth the drive. I had Brian as a sales person and Anthony as my financial guy. I highly recommend both of them. ",4.2

We are from out of town and had been shopping a POV Lexus RX 350 when we came across the best deal....least mileage, lowest price to the latest (year 2017) model. Me and my husband run a very tight schedule (and not to mention that I was not feeling very well at this shopping time). We had a skeptical attitude, coming from out of town if we could do the purchase very easily and quickly. Lo & behold, it wasn’t a problem at all. I contacted Korbie Contreras first thing Monday AM and with all of my papers completed the same day....me and my husband left Houston Monday evening and 1st thing Tue AM (the next day) as soon as the dealership opened Donnie welcomed us in and allowed us for a test drive (though we waited a little bit from 8:30 AM til 9:30 for the paperworks) once it got started, it went so easily and quickly.  Alex took over and handed us off to Anthony to whom all the purchase transactions took place in his office. It took us 1 hr to get done and we left at 1030 AM heading back to H town with the vehicle with us. My husband was able to come to work at 2 PM. It was that so easy and convenient for us getting the car that we were loving to have!!!!

208,"April 29, 2018","My husband and I live in North Austin (Pflugerville) and have been specifically looking for a used Jeep Grand Cherokee Summit along with other specifics but I’ll just keep this as simple as possible. After trying for several weeks to find one in Austin with decent miles and a fair price attached that also matched my budget, we decided it may be a good idea to look outside of Austin. We searched the surrounding cities and found a great possible match at the Boerne Dodge Chrysler Jeep Dealership. We called and got more information on the SUV as it had just arrived to the dealership the day before and no pics had been posted yet. Eric was very nice and very helpful, he sent over pictures through text and email and more details of the vehicle. We scheduled an appointment for the next day around 10am-noon. We didn’t know exactly what time we would arrive. We showed up exactly at 11am. When we arrived, everyone was friendly and greeted us and asked what they could do for us. We checked in saying we are Jodi and Jacob here to see Eric and to look at the 2014 White Jeep Grand Cherokee Summit. The first associate said Eric “was just filling up a tank of gas for the car he just sold and he will be back in 5 minutes. We literally hovered around the car, sitting on the inside for about a week 10-15 minutes discussing it and checking out the condition of the vehicle. Another associate, Jason the floor Manager, asked if we had been helped yet and he knew our needs and also asked “could I get you a different associate to take care of us”. My husband didn’t care who helped but since Eric was on top of things and sent me pics I decided to wait for him. Jason said ok and said “he is just filling up a tank of gas and will back in 10 minutes.

We’ve now been waiting around for about 40 minutes and EVERYONE KNEW WE WERE IN LINE TO TEST DRIVE THIS VEHICLE AND THIS VEHICLE ONLY. 

We were approached by Rick, a diff rent employee who told us to go ahead and check out other pre-owned vehicles while we waited for our test drive. 

The next thing happened was unbelievable. We walked away from the Summit for literally 90 seconds and some blonde associate jumped in the vehicle with two prospects that just showed up and took off for a test drive. We asked what was going on...

Ever since we arrived it was always “oh yeah, Eric will be with you in 5 mins...”

What happened Eric??? Everyone else???? Y’all knew we were there waiting for a test drive. We were there to test and to buy THAT car. We didn’t know it would take Eric a whole hour to get with us.

The car was bought and we were very upset on how the situation was handled.

The manager at this joke of a place, Orlando, basically held my friend and her children hostage in a the dealership. The background story is this: 

My friend went to buy a truck and used her 2015 Dodge Journey as a trade in. She purchased the truck on the 29th of March and on a April 1st was called to come into the dealership and sign one last paper. When she went in, they tried to tell her that the loan that she agreed to and signed a contract on for 5% APR was denied and therefore she would need to sign a new contract with a much higher interest rate and higher payment. Naturally she refused and that is when all xxxx broke loose. The manager tried to use his size to intimidate her, yelled at her in front of her children, locked her in the dealership, told her he had every right to change the terms and she had no choice and refused to give her back her trade in which the bank verified was still under a loan in her name. Even just one of those things is appalling but add it all up (and trust me, there was much more) and this place is despicable!!  

She was then told that she couldn't take the new truck with her or they would report it stolen and she also couldn't leave it on the lot or they would have it impounded at her expense and since they refused to let her turn it in and take back her trade in, she was left without a vehicle for her and her 2 young children.

215,"December 19, 2016","By far the worst dealership I have ever dealt with.  I wasted two hours of my life at this joke of a dealership.  I only asked two things from this dealership:  How much for my trade-in?  And how much for the truck I am looking to buy?  Two hours later and I only have the trade-in amount.

We went to this dealership looking to buy a Ram 2500 Laramie.  We were not greeted when we got there.  We walked by two salesman sitting out front and was ignored.  This is ok with me as I rather look around first.  So after we located the truck we wanted, I walked back to the dealership building and got one of those two salesman to help us.  I forgot this kids name but he starts doing the paperwork to get an appraisal amount on my trade-in.  He of course keeps my keys so ""his service manager can look at my truck as well.""  This is of course just a sales tactic.  They like to keep your keys so you can't just up and leave at your discretion.  

Now this is where things get weird.  The kid salesman passes us on to an older (more experienced) salesman.  He tells us he has to because he ""has to teach someone how to drive a stick.""  This became very awkward as he never left the dealership and most certainly did not show someone how to drive a stick.  So now we are forced to pretty much start over with this new salesman.  He kept saying ""this is why I hate coming in at the tail end of a deal.""  He went out to the truck (2017 Laramie) we were wanting.  I guess to get more info off of it?  They said they also have a 2016 Laramie.  He went to go find that but came back and said the truck was damaged.  

So after literally two hours, I still do not have have a trade-in amount or a price for the truck we are wanting to purchase.  I tell him this and he quickly and rudely says they will give me $37k for my trade-in.  This is lower than other dealerships but I realize this is a numbers game.  As long as they can sell the truck at a decent price, we can still make a deal.  

So he comes back with the price of the truck.  It was a really good price but they were still talking of $800 a month for the payment with $1000 down.  I told them I am tier 1 credit and I do not put money down.  They ask how much do I want my payment at?  I already told them I was wanting around $700.  So they have me sign saying that if they can get it at $720 for 6 years, I will purchase.  I agree, sign it, and then fill out the credit app.  

Now it gets weird again.  He comes back with the keys in his hand and says ""what is this?""  I look at him like he is stupid.  He then says ""what keys are these?""  Well sir, those are the keys to the truck we have been discussing these past two hours. He then tells me that they must have put in the wrong stock number.  We walk out to the truck and confirm the stock number on the keys, is infact the correct stock number to the truck we have been working a price on.  

So after two hours, this dealership wasn't even getting me pricing on the truck we were asking for.  They were giving me the pricing on a stripped down SLT, not the Laramie.  And I find that amazing because who in their right mind would pay $800 a month for a stripped down Ram? 

I have bought a lot of new cars.  I have been to a lot of dealerships.  Some good experiences and some bad.  But this dealership takes the cake.  This has been the most ridiculous and incompetent dealership I have ever been to.  I am shocked that this dealership can even remain open.",1.0

Amazing!  Outstanding! Accommodating!  Those are only a few of the many positive adjectives that come to mind in our dealing with Boerne Dodge. Searching over the Internet for a one ton Ram 4 wheel drive with an assortment of particular options, we narrowed our search to 75 miles from San Antonio.  We texted and emailed many dealerships who advertised that they had such a vehicle.  Many handed us off to other internet services or did not have the vehicles they promoted on the web.  From our very first contact with Boerne they were helpful and honest.  The Internet salesman was helpful and assured us that they had the vehicle on their lot and we could come down and check it out.  
This is where Boerne really stepped up to the plate.  I explained we were in New York and I would have a relative come in on Saturday and they would be driving over an hour to get there so please make sure the vehicle is there. They assured me it would be there and if there was a problem they would contact us. Our son met with the Internet salesman (who I believe was Jason)    and he would hand him off to a salesman.  
Saturday, my son arrived and was introduced to Anthony Thelmann who proceeded to pull up the vehicle close enough to the showroom so that we could FaceTime using their wi-fi and virtually view the Ram Truck with every one of the options we had asked for. Not only were they knowledgeable about the vehicle they were extremely patient with my numerous questions from my virtual vehicle inspection.  
The team at Boerne made us a phenomenal offer and we bought our dream Ram right here over FaceTime. My son signed some intent papers and gave them the necessary information. Paperwork was overnighted to us. Any phone calls for clarifications were met with patience and thoroughness. We arranged financing through our own credit union and sent back a deposit with the paperwork and as they say the rest is history. We drove out to Texas with the bank check for the balance and because we were arriving earlier than expected called and asked if we could pick it up a day earlier than scheduled. Once again they went out of their way to accommodate us. 
Anthony was waiting outside for us when we arrived and after the necessary paperwork with Brian....who was also a gem, Anthony spent time going over the vehicle with us and dispensed a wealth of knowledge about our Ram.  Boerne sent us off assuring us if we needed anything just call. 
I write this review as we drive back to NY to finalize the sale of our home and look forward to returning back to Texas. 

As I reflect on this whole transaction I realize this was done from 1800 miles away with constant reassurances from Boerne and absolutely no angst or worry for us. We arrived Saturday at 9 in the morning and drove away by 11:00  It was seamless!  What a joy to deal with professional, friendly people.

There is no handicapped parking. Everyone is Very rude... Except in buying process. Beware of snake and false promises.  Bryan Wallace is there to line his pockets with $$ and Andy(service manager) follows his orders.  Dont mistake them for being weak or not knowing what they are doing, they know exactly what they are doing. In the car buying process-They make alot of promises but never follow through even when its in writing, text message etc with salesperson.  Since their salesperson left, they wont stand behind any of the correspondence.

Bought used truck that they knew should have been auctioned off and instead sold it with false promises. We were duped. 

No one seems to know how to return a phone call. We are going on four days now. If you show up in person, everyone is at lunch, away from desk or in a meeting. 

Service department is a scam. We have complained about an issues since we bought truck in April... since before we bought vehicle, were promised it would get fixed. Amazingly they said everything was fine in April and we disagreed, the truck lost power, they cant duplicate the issues and now they are saying we owe $1300 to fix ac condenser and thats what caused truck to lose power.

I am not an easy person to do business with, as I have my company purchase my vehicles and always have a STRICT budget!

I felt like FOR THE FIRST TIME at a car dealership that “just making a sale” was NOT Anthony’s first priority. I could tell, he was MAKING SURE I was happy FIRST!!! I could not believe it!!!

Once in finance I met with Jose Fernandez, again, he showed me more respect than ANY Finance Manager I HAVE EVER WORKED WITH! Jose DID NOT rush to the first bank to approve me…he explained all my buying options and made sure the terms from the bank were CLEARLY explained and FAIR!!  Once we agreed on the bank terms, Jose had me COMPLETELY OUT of the finance office in UNDER 15 minutes TOTAL!! I was BLOWN AWAY and it did not feel like I had just bought a car. These men speak to you with respect and clarity!  I was so impressed with the service I felt like I HAD TO share this with anyone who would listen! 5 Stars is not enough to give to this AMAZING group of dealers! They are UNBELIEVABLE! I would buy again from them in a HEARTBEAT! TO conclude, before I had left the dealership Mr. Thelemann had shown me how to connect my phone to the Bluetooth in my truck, explained all the digital workings, and would not let me leave until he knew I was 100% HAPPY! 
Again, I can be difficult to deal with. He explained everything in simple terms I could understand quickly and must say… When it was over, I felt like I had known him for years! I am NOT EXAGGERATING! I LOVE this dealership and recommend them TO ANYONE who wants a NO HASSLE NO PRESSURE approach to car buying!! So, my special THANK YOU to: Salesmen, Anthony Thelemann
General Manager, Leroy Salazar and 
The General Sales Manager, Jason Bardas. 
I cannot thank you enough for the way you Men do business! Just AMAZING!

231,"May 20, 2016","To the Customer Service Department of Boerne Dodge(and all else).
All was well with getting my Dodge Nitro serviced at Boerne Dodge (where I purchased it from 1 year ago) until I asked for a rental. After looking at the reviews for Dodge service locations here in San Antonio and seeing all the terrible reviews, I decided to stay loyal with Boerne Dodge since I purchased my vehicle from them. I knew I had a cylinder 5 misfire and communication between my service advisor Joseph and myself was great for the first couple of weeks. They found the problem immediately, ordered parts, installed them, all covered by warranty. My service advisor even convinced me to allow them to replace the timing belt (not covered by warranty). I later found out that it wasn't necessary to replace that yet since I still had 35,000 miles to go according to the factory required maintenance guide. What a way to get more money out of customers for unnecessary things! 

Now here comes the real problem. My SUV has been there for a whole month now! I didn't ask for a rental until that point. My service advisor Joseph claimed there weren't any rentals available. He sounded like he just wanted to rush me off the phone. So I called a few Enterprise locations and was assured that they had rentals available. I then called APEX (my warranty) and they were very helpful and let me know that they would gladly pay for a rental through enterprise as long as my service advisor would call and put in a claim. I then called my service advisor told him what I was told and he said he would contact APEX. I didn't receive a call back for 2 days so I went ahead and called back. Before I did so I spoke with APEX again just to see if Joseph had called them and he hadn't. APEX was even shocked once I vented to them about what was going on. The CSR said a whole month for the problem being fixed was way too long and were surprised with how much patience I've had through all the nonsense. So I finally got ahold of my service advisor Joseph and he then tried to go ahead and tell me there weren't any rentals AGAIN! I wasn't accepting that for an answer since he had yet to even try to call and he finally spoke with APEX while I was on hold. Once back to my line he said under his breath ""this is a mess"" and let me know he had to write up a labor receipt for APEX to figure out how long they'd give me a rental. The next day he called me back and said they'd only pay for 3 days of rental according to the labor needed on my vehicle. I've been so frustrated with him so I said that's fine and let it go. Can you imagine if I had asked for a rental in the first place? 3 days! Only 3 days of a rental before I'd have to pay the cost on my own for a whole month and then some.

Now another concern. They have been unable to locate a part (valve seal) needed for my vehicle and Joseph said it was because they stopped making Dodge Nitros so that part is no longer available. They ordered a timing cover case(I think that's what he called it) and are hoping the seal would come with that. But what if it doesn't? I barely purchased my vehicle from them 1 year ago and now I'm going to have to worry about it messing up again and not having spare parts available for it?! I also have had a vacation planned to the beach for my daughter and I next weekend condo purchased and all and now I don't even know if they'll be done with my vehicle by then! 
I feel like they have had more than enough time to finish with my SUV. I am beyond frustrated, disappointed, and if this is the way Boerne Dodge takes care of their business I suggest you save yourself the trouble and find another place to service your vehicle.

Sincerely,

Vinny worked with us on every step of the process to make sure all of our questions were answered and that we had the right vehicle.  The truck was in great condition and they even went as far as fixing an item that malfunctioned while we were testing out the vehicle.  I've been to dealers that say their cars are in top shape only to show up and find that not even basic maintenance was up to date.  At Boerne Dodge, the vehicle was obviously well looked over and cleaned up before being placed on the lot (we've had dealer experiences where the vehicle was clearly marked for sale without being inspected or at least had minimal maintenance); believe me as we went over it with a fine tooth comb.  I'd say Vinny went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed by the time we finished the transaction.  As with any dealership, having your stuff (know what you need for a trade in, what you're buying, have your financing ready) together before make a buying decision will make for the best experience; and we had no complaints.   I got a fair price on my purchase as well as my trade in.  I'll be giving Vinny a call if we're back on the market for another vehicle.",5.0

When CJ in Service told Joe Valadez about our problem trying to find a used SUV within our budget when the old Dodge pickup needed one too many repairs, he began looking for possibilities days before we ever met in person.  And when he had to return to the office, his associate Trey Roberts took over.  He wasn't able to find anything either--mainly because we were looking for a unicorn where price and mileage were concerned.  But when we began talking a newer model with partial financing, they got together and found two possibilities, one that Joe had been wise enough to spot for us already--just in case.  A 2015 Jeep Cherokee with great mileage and payments within our budget for the half we didn't pay down was just too wonderful a deal to pass up.  And when Mark Montz in the finance department helped us get a 5 year extended warranty that was so much more cost effective than only a 2 month warranty on a used SUV at another dealership, it made for the perfect deal.  Joe and Trey literally went the extra mile and followed us home with the new 
Jeep to save us a 50 mile return trip the next day to retrieve it.  They all did their very best to work with us for the best deal possible for us.   I can't recommend Boerne Dodge Chrysler Jeep highly enough, and the team of Joe Valadez and Trey Roberts is simply the best.",5.0

We looked at our options and it didn't seem like we'd be driving away with a new vehicle.  but Joe didn't give up. My girlfriend has been wanting a Jeep for some time and I needed to get out of my old car. We found a very nice and well equipped Cherokee that was right in our price range. We had a nice low down payment and very reasonable monthly payments that they negotiated for us. All we had to do was test drive, go over some options, make the down payment and sign some paperwork. We did spend the better part of the day there but it was worth it rolling out of there with a brand new Jeep!",5.0

300,"December 26, 2014","Worst experience ever! No appreciation for military and uses deceptive advertisement to get you in the door. Dealer did not want to advertise $13,500 discount being advertised on-line. The vehicle I was looking at was a 2500 priced at $65,600. The manager stated the 2500 was not a heavy duty truck and the add was for 3500s only, despite 2 other salesmen defining heady duty as the 2500 and 3500 class. When I brought that act to the floor manager he said he meant it was for the more expensive heavy duty trucks and stated there were some on the lot for $68,000 to $70,000 and he admitted it was all about advertising and getting traffic into the store. Then they would not honor a $500 military discount. Lastly, my trade it low booked on the NADA for between $15,000 and $17,500. They claimed my vehicle was in good condition but would not give me more than $12,000, stating they had a separate ""auction NADA listing"" and that it was impossible for people to get vehicles with more than 100, 000 miles on them financed.

313,"October 29, 2014","My son has a 2004 Ram 3500 dual wheel pickup truck with a welding bed on it. The only way we could started it is with starting fluid. We had several mechanics look at it and many said it was the injectors while a couple said it could be something else. We decided that the best place to  take it would be a dealer since they should know all about Dodge Rams. They have the trained mechanics, all the engineering tools and specs etc.  We left it at Boerne Dodge service department and a couple of days later they called me and told me that the truck had water in the fuel tank and needed some fuel lines and a high pressure fuel pump. The price was going to be around $2200..00. for the repair...It seemed high to me but I figured that they would be able for fix it and that would be it. My son had saved his money for the repair and said to go ahead. They said it would be ready in a couple of days. On the day we were supposed to pick it up. I got a call from CJ in the service department...He told me that it still wouldn't start without the starting fluid. He told me that the fuel injector pump was not providing the correct PSI to get the fuel to the injectors and that also needed to be replaced. Now the price was going to be  about $50.00 shy of $3800.00. I was getting a little upset because the reason we took it to the dealer in the first place was so that we wouldn't go thru this . My son and I talked about it for a while and I asked CJ in service that it seemed kind of high. He assured me that that was all it was going to need and that that included some discounts. and that would be the final price out the door. I told him that I would have to think about it but my son said lets get it over with since he was saving money from work. We gave CJ the ok and he said that we would pick the truck up the following Tuesday. 
I called CJ Tuesday morning to tell him that we were on our way to pick it up. He immediately tells me that he has some bad news. He tells me that the fuel injectors are bad and he has to replace some other parts and now the repair is going to cost over 10,000.00. I told him that he promised me that it would be the $3800.00 but he said that he was sorry but it was now going to cost that much. I told him that the decision to proceed was that he told me that it would not cost anymore. If he had told me that it would be that much I would not have made the decision to repair it in the first place.  I told him that I had to figure out what I was going to do because no bank was gong to loan $6000. on a 2004 truck with 249000 miles for a repair. I asked him that instead of fixing it would it be possible to trade it in. We went in to look at another truck and they only wanted to give me $2000.00 trade on my son's Ram. This truck in in excellent condition and even at the age it has it is worth over 17,000 in Kelly Blue Book or NADA and even in rough condition it is shown to trade in at between 10,000- 13,000. I see trucks like this in worse shape on Craigslist all the time for between 15000 and 20,000. We were insulted. We came back home only to get a letter from Boerne Dodge""s attorney that if we did not pick up the vehicle and pay the 3800.00 that they were putting a garage man's Lean on it. I called them in disgust and asked to speak to the general manager but they told me that he was not there, he did not have a voice mail or an email address either. I called CJ and told him that I was on my way to pick up the truck but he said that I better bring a tow truck because it is still in pieces. I called their lawyer and told him what was going on and that I was not getting any answers from the dealer. Also that the truck was not put back together. He assured me that he would talk to the General Manager and have him call me. I told him that I would pick up the truck as soon as they could put it back in the condition it was in when we took it in. The General Manager finally called me and was so arrogant that he refused to do anything about it.  I have since called Chrysler Corp. and lodged a complaint and it has been escalated to a higher level as a reasonable complaint which includes excessive charges. We called CJ again to pick up the truck today and he now was requiring a cashier's check. We picked up the truck and paid with the cashier's check with a memo on the check that reads ""Paid in full under protest"". We got the truck and when we tried to get in it to drive off we found grease all over the seat the carpet and the inside door trim on both the driver and passenger side. When we asked them that  I just spent close to $4000.00 for nothing and this is the way I get my truck back they said that once they handed us the keys they cannot touch the truck anymore.  I told one of the managers about it and he turned off the vehicle and tried to restart it. Since it didn't start without starting fluid I told the service department that I needed it started back up again so that I could drive off. Since they said they could not touch it anymore they handed us a can starting fluid and said that that was all they could do. We finally started it after 2 tries and drove off.  This is not over.

315,"October 05, 2014","I had a wonderful experience at the Boerne Dodge Chrysler Jeep Ram dealership.  As a teacher I do not have much time to spare.  So it is important to have things taken care of in a timely manner.  My salesman, Robert Norfleet, was not only able to help me pick out a car but took care of all of the paperwork.  
He met with me on his day off and walked the lot with me showing and explaining different features, benefits,  sizes, gas mileage, and prices.  I did not feel rushed and had my questioned answered with a straight forward approach.  The truth is that I do not want to beat around the bush.  
20 minutes after I got home from work my car was delivered.  He went over all of the features, owners manual, warranty, tires, paired my phone with the vehicle (I love this part of the car immensely btw)  and even made sure that I was comfortable behind the wheel of my very first new car. 
We sat down and he went over all of the paper work with him explaining financing, down payments, more warranty information, interest rate, the factory warranty and service contract. 
All in all, it took about 4 hours time out of a week and that was with the drive from San Antonio to Boerne.  The drive was well worth my time.

Although, I enjoyed the Boerne Dealership some time before, it seemed quite far as I'm conveniently located in the center of San Antonio, Texas. Nonetheless, I was fixed on a 2014 Dodge Ram 1500, Hemi-8 speed and had some frustrating time at the several conveniently located dealerships in regards to negotiating the price. That same day, I called Boerne Dodge and, luckily, Paul was working. I got in that evening and within 30 minutes Paul had me sitting down with a glass of water as he located the vehicle I wanted and assured me that the vehicle will be delivered the following day. Paul made the negotiation so simple and efficient and broke down the costs for me, explaining the purchase, and I was completely satisfied. Paul even offered to pick me up the next day, on his day off, to bring me to the dealership in Boerne to pick up my vehicle.

367,"December 26, 2013","I've lived in Boerne for many years and have dropped in here numerous times to buy a car/truck. On all occasions I've noticed Boerne Dodge is unwilling to negotiate price. What you see on the sticker is what you will pay. I find this odd because their overhead must be way below local competitors. Why?

The place looks like it was built in 1965. No remodeling. Antiquated in every respect. The salesmen are poorly dressed. So why do they offer high prices and an unwillingness to negotiate? 

I'm doubtful of all of the 5 start ratings I see here. As I said, my comments are not based on one visit, but many. I suspect that a lot of these supportive reviews were written by Boerne Dodge sales personnel with time on their hands, friends or people who believe that buying a car is like shopping at H-E-B where you can't haggle. 

In the end, I've always found far better pricing for Dodge vehicles in San Antonio.

I recently was in search of trading in my car that I knew I was going to have negative equity on but having so many problems with that car I was wanting to trade it in. I took that vechicle to the dealership I orginially had purchase it, thinking since it was their make they would give me the most for it. Well that was totally incorrect, they gave me less than blue book value. 
I then continue to look at other dealerships but either they were too pushy or simply not helpful addressing my needs.
After hearing my story at work, my co-worker referred my to go see Joe Valadez at Boerne Dodge. The first thing I did was call him because at this point I was simply tired of running around in circles. From the moment I spoke to Joe Valadez on the phone, he listened to what I looking for and got straight to the point of addressing my needs. I then was able to do most of the pre-qualification paperwork via fax. Once I was approved, I went to see Joe and started test driving. Shortly after that, I was in the process of buying a beautiful 2014 Jeep Patriot. Not only was I satisfied with the great customer service, Boerne Dodge gave me more on my trade in then any other dealership had offered me!
Joe Valadez gave me personal customer service that I was in search of and the price range I was needing. I will continue referring family and friends to Boerne Dodge.

Moving to San Antonio from LA, I needed to buy a new car.  I found a Jeep Grand Cherokee on Autotrader at Boerne Dodge that seemed like it would be a reasonable option.  After negotiating the deal over the phone, agreeing to a price, and getting approved for a loan through their credit provider, their finance manager Brandon said he would FedEx me the paperwork to complete the sale and I'd have the car waiting for me when I arrived in SA.  Received a FedEx package two days later with the appropriate paperwork, only my name was spelled wrong (Bryan) and they tried to sell me a 3 year 36,000 warranty for $1500 even though I confirmed three times that the warranty would be for 5 years and 100,000 miles over the phone for the same $1500.  After calling Brandon several times and not hearing anything back, I finally told the receptionist that if I didn't hear back in an hour I was going elsewhere.  Ten minutes later Brandon calls back, apologizes, and says he'll overnight the corrected paperwork to me.  Two days later no paperwork, so I call again.  Again get ignored after leaving several messages.  Spoke to the manager Matt, said this is ridiculous, this is total incompetence, this should be the easiest part of making the sale.  Matt agrees, promises to straighten it out and call me back within the hour.  Well it's been a week now and I've already bought a different Grand Cherokee from IPAC Jeep, so I guess that's that.

My hypothesis: they were trying to get a check from me in the mail, and when I went to pick up the car they'd say they couldn't title it to me due to the misspelling of my name and would use the fact that I'd already given them money to hold me hostage on a different car they'd bait and switch in.  Whether they're unethical or incompetent, either way STAY AWAY!!!",1.0

387,"August 03, 2013","It had to come to this. Since it has been so hard to receive a response from anyone, I am writing a review of mu frustration. I decided that I wanted to trade my car in on something else. I Purchased my car from Boerne Dodge (used). I bought a extended warranty through Apex, and I also bought credit life and disability (I didn't remember that one). I paid $3000 for the warranty, $665.06 for the life, and $1397.60 for the disability. I originally emailed Apex to cancel the warranty. They said that I needed to have the dealership cancel it all. I got in touch with Mark at Boerne Dodge, and gave him all the info that he needed. I sent a second email, asking if he had received everything. He said ""got it...Thanks"". During a phone conversation he had stated that it would take 6-8 weeks to process my refund, which was going to be somewhere in the $3000+ range. I emailed Apex back and asked them if this was correct, they stated that is the standard time frame that they quote when cancelling service. They also said to email them, in a week to make sure everything was processing. I did not email the following week as it was the 4th of July week. I emailed (Apex)later the following week, asking for a status. They replied that they had not received any requests for it. Apex said they would contact Boerne Dodge and see what was going on. They responded that someone should be in contact with me. I gave it a few days, and I never received a call. I also tried calling again, and was told the person I needed to speak with was out. I emailed back to Apex and gave them this info. They emailed me again last week saying that they are looking into it. I have not heard anything back. I also emailed the dealer again....still nothing. It was supposed to take 6-8 weeks....I am starting week 6 now, and I have nothing as of yet. These cancellations are pro-rated as well.....the longer it takes, the less I get back.",1.0

423,"August 11, 2012","I was unsure what my visit would be like, since my prior experiences with Car Dealers has been less than spectacular and borderd on homicidial, theirs. But I was told by a very good friend that this would not be the case, so I agreeded to have a somewhat open mind. 
When we arrived we were greeted by Paul Caciola outside the dealership, friendly smile and handshake and he asked me what I was looking for, and took me to the very model I was interested in. I realized he was completely knowledgeable in Ram Trucks and explained what the differences in models were and what would fit my needs. We looked at eight different trucks, all slightly different in appointyments and settled on the model I thought was ""the right one"" after a test drive I agreeded this would be an excellent choice, had the ""right color and stuff"". 
Now came the real ""Dental Pain"" part of buying the car/truck, ""The Finance Guy"" ""Let me see what my Manager says"" and ""The we'd like to do that, BUT""  Well it never happened, this was the smoothest and somewhat enjoyable transaction I have ever experienced purchasing a vechile. I was treated with respect from all individuals I came in contact with,everyone I saw working in/at the dealership had smiles and would acknowledge you and that you were there to conduct business, friendly, curterious and professional. I am truly imprssed with the experience and followup phone call from the Dealership.

424,"August 02, 2012","This was a pleasant experience until it came time to do the deal. The entire time I was talking to the two salepeople, test driving the truck, and afterward, I told them I needed the total price to come in under $30k, out the door, tax tielte and license, and they kept saying, no problem, we can do it, and they said they were over stocked and it played to my favor for negotiations. Well, well, what a sham! I called and told them that I was interested in buying the truck after test driving the other brands. They said come on in, the numbers work fine. So I went back to the dealership expecting to buy the truck for what we had been talking about. So I asked, what is the finaly price I needed to make out the bank / dealers electronic check for, the the salemsan said, Let me go check. This should have been my first clue - he already knew, but was pretending not to. He came back with a paper with a number of $33k, and +T,T&L + fees. I figure they felt like I was emotionally tied to the truck and they could now jack up the price. The salesman looked shocked when my wife and I stood up, I told him these were not anywhere near the numbers we talked about, and we walked out the door. I wonder how many people they squeeze for an extra few thousand everyday. Most people are so emotionally bought in to the idea of the new car or truck they drove, that they reluctantly sign the contracts. It is a sleazy, sleazy sales technique.

Second sign the salesman knew nothing about what he was selling. Third sign, the place is FILTHY and severely outdated they have a display with cassette players (I feel bad for the receptionist (really nice lady)). Men are spitting in trash cans with customers standing around - it was just surreal. If all that sounds bad...I haven't even begun to scratch the surface. We saw the deal on 2011 Dodge Rams $12,500 off the MSRP, when we got there we were told it wasn't all RAMS just 2500's. So we picked out a 2500. When we started paperwork they told us the more we spent the bigger discount we got...clearly that's not what the Ad says. We didn't argue much because other dealerships use the same tactics or they try to tell you it's a particular truck on the lot.  And unlike 99% of the dealerships I've dealt with Boerne doesn't fill up your vehicle. Actually for us we were told the guy with the purchasing card had left for the evening (it was 8pm on a Saturday - closing time)the truck was on empty and could only make it 10 miles but there was a gas station down the road. My husband asked if he should come back to get it filled up to which the salesman said we only give you twenty bucks and it's probably not worth it for you to come back. My husband and I get in the vehicle and we notice it's not a keyless entry like we asked for!  So while my husband fills the truck up with gas I press the bluetooth key on the radio only to find out it's not enabled on the truck (another thing the salesman ""uh huh'd"" when my husband asked if it came with it. The next morning I'm still a little angry about the gas, key, and bluetooth thing and I notice the inspection sticker is only good for the next 7 months....we just got 2 new vehicles about 5 months ago and those stickers are good until 11/2012 and 10/2012. Needless to say I told my husband to take it back and get our paid off trade in back. Well they sweet talked him and assured him on Monday all the issues would get taken care of and they would call him back with a solution.  It is now Friday and after 2 more calls just today there has been no call back.  The odd thing is if you research this dealership (which I'm kicking myself for not doing) everyone has the same story. It's sad that they would lose two potential lifetime customers and their referrals over a tank of gas and inspection stickers (we gave up on the bluetooth and the keyless entry - not sure that I want them to work on the truck if they are at the same level as the salesman.)",1.8

The above transaction occurred in January 2011.  Both Paul and Mickey knew I had a 6500lb travel trailer that the 1500 needed to pull.  Neither of them warned me or said anything about the fact that the 1500 with the installed 3.21 gears was not capable of pulling the trailer.  I pulled it to Rockport, TX in April.  The truck struggled severely with this load.  I did a lot of research and found that these gears were not capable of pulling this much weight.  Mickey had since left Boerne Dodge so I talked to Paul and someone in the Service Department.  Paul refused to believe that this 1500 was not capable of pulling this much weight.  As a matter of fact he guaranteed me on both the sales day and this day that the 1500 would pull 10,000lbs.  I finally contacted Chrysler and filed a complaint.  The lady there has been trying to talk to the Service Manager.  To-date nobody at Boerne Dodge has returned her calls or mine.  Chrysler will not pay to replace the gears with 3.55 or 3.92.  The dealer will also not pay the $1900 to replace the gears.  So, I'm stuck.  Lesson learned.  I would recommend not shopping at Boerne Dodge in Boerne, TX, as you cannot believe anything they say.  Buyer beware!!!",4.0
472,"December 10, 2010","Went to look for a new truck during the test drive I asked what the bottom line was and was quoted the the sticker price. I responded with I don't want to spend all day here please give me the lowest price, response again was full sticker for a ram 1500. I told him i would compare his best price with a competitor in SA and buy from the lowest but I refuse to spend all day haggling, response again was sticker and was told to get a price from another dealership first and then we could talk.  I left and will never return, I recommend you do the same.  ",1.2

The team at Boerne Chrysler is friendly, courtliest, and hones t team of people.  What they commit to, they deliver to ….great place to do business.

474,"November 12, 2010","I went in not knowing exactly what I wanted and was shown the Dodge Charger. I thought it was out of my price range but after they crunched the numbers it wasn't. It's i car I love and highly recommend to everybody because of the way it drives and how much room is actually in it. The employees at this dealership knew what I liked and would like to have and they nailed exactly what I really wanted. I went in thinking I was going to get something that was just ok, and i left with a car I felt and still feel great in.",5.0
475,"September 02, 2010","My wife and I went to check a Ram 1500 crew cab that they anounced on the newspaper that had 16k of discount. On my way to the dealer I figured that there would be a trick on those 16k, but that in the end at least I would have about 13k or so in discounts. When we arrived they showed us what trucks they had and told us that they  still had the discount anounced in the newspaper but it would not apply to all trucks. We saw some of the trucks and went inside to talk numbers. We were looking for a crewcab and the price we were looking was in the 23,000 more or less. The ""Fianacial advisor"" went to a lot of places trying to look for prices but he did come back with a regular cab truck in the 22k's and told us literaly that ""the newspaper was just advertisement"" and smiled at us. We told him that they had the price we looked for in other dealers and he told us that those trucks were cheap and second category with no AC. After that he told us to come the next day in the morning to check what he could do for us, and give us the truck that was on the same advertisement announced for 15k at 22k.   The announcement was made on the San Antonio Express Sunday Car shopper (29aug2010.  

Look for this labor day shooper discounts and if you appreciate your time don't waste it driving to this dealer, use your time wisely in another dealer that knows how to win costumers.",2.0
476,"August 24, 2010","This was the worst experience my wife or I have ever had trying to purchase a car. We went the first time because we heard a radio ad claiming $13,000 off Dodge Ram 1500s. When we went, we spoke with Steve, told him we were in the market, but we were not quite ready to buy yet. He let us test drive a truck, and explained that the discount was on a select few trucks that the dealership had purchased at a discount from the manufacturer. We checked the web site a couple of weeks later to see that the discount on some of the trucks was now $15,000. The site said $4,500 Dodge/GMAC discount and $10,500 Boerne Dodge discount. I called Steve to see what they had for the $15K discount. He told me they had about 19 trucks at that discount, starting at $37K before the discount.  I told him I wanted to meet with him to see what they had, since I was ready to buy. When I got there, Steve was with another customer, and told me Roy would help me out. Roy showed us the trucks, but told us that the only trucks eligible for the $15K discount were the ones marked $50K and up. He also mentioned the discount was based on upgrades that they had made at the dealership. Very few of the trucks had accurate pricing, so when we wanted to get the price of a couple of vehicles, Roy had to go inside to look up the information. We told him that we did not understand the discounts, since the web site and Steve both claimed $15K off. Roy said that some of the salesmen do not understand the discounts and brought us inside to talk to Darryl, who we met the first time we visited. Darryl is supposedly Steve's boss. We saw Steve walking around, but he never approached us. Darryl came out and said he was going to get us the correct information. We went back out and found a truck we liked, Daarryl told us that the truck was $15K off and would have a discounted price of $28,640. He mentioned some of the upgrades, and that the truck did not have the bed rails. We drove the truck, and upon returning told him we wanted to get more information, numbers, etc. He said that we would have to wait until Monday (this was on a Friday) before he could get us all the information we wanted, which sounded odd. We asked him if they could hold the truck for us until then, and he said no. I asked him if someone wanted to buy the truck before Monday, what would they do. He said, Oh I can get you that information. He got me some figures on a print out with a total sales price of around $32K. I asked him how he came up with that figure because he told me $28,640 earlier. He went away and came back with slightly different figures that still did not reflect the correct price he told us. He said it was because the truck only had a $14K discount, since it had no bed rails. My wife and I both told him that he never mentioned that earlier. In a very condescending way he told us that he did mention the $14K discount on the truck due to a lack of rails. My wife and I both know what we heard, and this man was mistaken. He finally got up and said he would find out more information for us. At this point we had already been here a couple of hours, and had gotten nowhere. Another gentleman cam out, I don't know his name but he was a tall white guy, also very condescending. We explained our frustration, but received no apologies, only an explanation of the $10,500 Boerne discount. He mentioned that their discount was composed of a bunch of other discounts that we do not qualify for. We wanted to know if the salesmen receive training to understand the discounts, and he said they just get training to show the vehicles and get the customers back to the table for someone else to do all the paperwork. Again, we expressed our frustration and confusion, and disappointment for driving all the way to Borene to look at something that was not as advertised. The guy was very arrogant in his response, which upset my wife. At this point I knew that we would never be a customer of Boerne Dodge. I told my wife ""let's just go. They obviously do not want our business."" The guy was not apologetic, and in a very sarcastic way, said thanks for coming out to Boerne Dodge. We saw Steve on the way out. He was trying very hard to avoid eye contact with us. What a bunch of cowards and Jerks!!",1.0

478,"June 25, 2010","I bought a used vehicle from Boerne Dodge Chrysler Jeep one year ago. When I asked the condition of the vehicle after the test drive, the salesperson stated there were no issues with the vehicle. I had my own financing already completed through a lender and advised them that I didn't want to apply for credit through their dealership. After being advised NUMEROUS times that they wanted me to finance through them, I kept refusing and told them I already had the loan approval and check ready for pick-up at the bank. After going through this discussion over and over with them, I was filling out the paperwork for my new purchase. While filling out the paperwork, the salesman through in a form and said it was for social security number verification...stated ""This is not a credit check for financing"", so I agreed to sign for this purpose. After a few weeks, I decided to check my credit report....and guess what...there is now a hard inquiry on my credit that will remain there for 2 years from Boerne Dodge Chrysler Jeep. Do not trust the sales people at this dealership. You would think that would be satisfied with just selling a vehicle, however that is not the case! I have been tricked and now I have to wait two years for the inquiry to disappear from my credit report. I am very displeased with the occurence and refuse to buy another vehicle from this dealership. Also about a month later I ended up having to have the driveshaft, brake pads, a rotor, and caliper replaced. DO NOT SHOP AT THIS DEALERSHIP!!!",1.0
479,"June 03, 2010","First off, I was told they had 5 dodge ram 2500 4x4's in stock. So after driving 40 miles to see them the salesman could only come up with 2. Second, the manager in the enclosed area that works the deals and finds vehicles on the enternet was rude and wanted to only deal with me and appraise my new 2010 Ford f150 IF I WAS ACTUALLY ready to purchase a truck from them. I told them that I have to compare prices and look around for a few days to see if their prices were competitive. He told me to come back when I was serious and was ready to buy. I told him, I am serious but I am not going to buy at the first place I stop. They were very high preasured sales people that I want nothing to do with. The salesman tried calling me back the next day and I let it go to voicemail, then deleted it. NO SALE...
Nothing but lies from these guys and pressure sales.",1.0
