0,"June 04, 2020","I contacted your dealership for a vehicle that I had seen online, in doing so I was connected with Tommy nguyen. 

Tommy was communicative efficient and ready for me.

I arrive to see the vehicle and talk numbers I discuss numbers with Tommy while another family was looking at the vehicle and test driving it.

He warned me that if they come into the building they’re looking to buy so I simply go to the car take a look drive it it within the parking lot And immediately signed

I signed an agreement that said the final price of the vehicle and to proceed with providing my preapproval from the bank as well as my drivers license and insurance to now put my down payment

When Mr. Tommy delivered the news to the counter some other man who said he was a manager in a suit
Cussed underneath his breath and rolled his eyes at us

This same manager came to me within five minutes and ripped up my paper that I had signed and said that someone else bought the car sorry I reiterate on what I signed first he goes this is not a legal document it doesn’t matter if you signed they already got the car I said but have a signed and he said no once again and then I reminded him that I signed why did I sign and provide all my paperwork to show that I’m ready to own this car and he yelled at me and told me to calm down and proceeded to again because underneath his breath

Tommy did not want to reveal this man’s name I guess out of protection but I wanted to let you know so you can figure out and find me a solution because I signed for a vehicle and I was Miss treated like to miss lead in my experience at your dealership

I actually hope to hear a phone call from you due to the lack of professionalism empathy and character that your leader ship and salesman carry while you’re not in the building",1.0
1,"May 18, 2020","We found a car we wanted, a Toyota Certified 2018 RAV4, and drove in on Saturday morning to make the deal.  Our sales rep asked us “what will it take to sell you this car?”  We told him we were willing to pay the asking price, but we wanted a new map micro USB card and a cargo net.  The map had a 2017 date on it and the net was missing, plus these are relatively inexpensive items.  

He went to confer with his boss and came back with an estimate sheet.  It had the agreed price and had another $995 added on for window tint and nitrogen in the tires.  According to the CarFax they provided us, window tint was installed when the car was new, in 2018, so why were they trying to add on additional amounts for that?  This is dishonest.  And nitrogen - who needs that?  They took it off, but grudgingly. 

The sales rep then proceeded to tell us that they could not do anything about the map and we would have to deal directly with the parts department.  There was no offer to wrap it into the purchase or to find a way to satisfy us.  He just said “not possible” and pretty much ignored our request.  

The sales rep said the manager gave him permission to rob a cargo net from another car on the lot, but that he was not allowed to put in a new net.  This sounded a bit sleazy and underhanded to us.  Honestly, the retail of the net was $69 and probably cost them $19 - which made us feel bad at first.  However when we got home we found that the net that they folded up and placed in the hatch area could not possibly fit the car we purchased as it is ridiculously big and could not be installed - which made us pretty mad.

When it was time to accept delivery of the car, the sales rep stated that there was only 1 key so that’s what he was giving us.  We told him that the Certified statement said there were 2 keys and he said, “oh yes” and took the car to have a second electronic box/key made.  He did not argue much about it, but tried to get away without giving us everything we should have received.

The cherry-on-top for this miserable transaction is that when we got home, we found that the electronic part of the second key was set up properly, but the mechanical key was uncut.  This is a safety mechanism to be used if the battery is depleted on the electronic box.  So now I have to go back completely across Houston and insist that they make this right.  

Never again with this dealership.",1.0
2,"April 24, 2020","This facility is not to be trusted, bought a used car, salesman assure there was no problem. Took to a trusted mechanic, in 5 minutes found MAJOR issues. Informed my salesman and never got a response. The repairs cost 2/3 the value I purchased the car. This car shouldn't have ever been sold on the lot. It was a mechanic special.",1.0

4,"March 20, 2019","Total Nightmare at Fort Bend Toyota I purchased a 2018 4RUNNER back in August and up to this date I have not gotten my plates every month I have to follow up since they do not bother to follow up with me to let me the status they always tell me every time they will call me to let me know my status but they don’t. Once again they temp tags have expired and no one has bothered to call me. I have asked to speak with the manager there but they just have the sales person or sales manager Jerry Dismuke speak with me and all they tell me is this has not happened before, I have the finance company and they said wrong paperwork was submitted, if the Toyota vehicles were not so dependable I would recommend not to buy them but they are but don’t get it from this Dealership Fort Bend Toyota!!! WORST EVER!!!! ",1.0
5,"June 08, 2018","It used to be good place to go for services, but becomes one of those where you go for simple maintenance and get bills for unnecessary services for few hundred or thousand $. I went there last weekend to change oil which usually costs about $70 and ended up having estimate to make repairs north of $1100.",1.6
6,"May 28, 2018","Initially, I did not want to deal with Fort Bend Toyota due to location and it’s customer service reputation, but when we were in the market to buy a new car for my wife in Feb ‘18, we decided to purchase at Fort Bend Toyota and the buying experience was good, and the salesman Victor, was extremely courteous and professional.

We brought the new auto in today for the first scheduled service visit and while there I was attempting to get a quote for truck rims in the parts department and the customer service was extremely terrible and it seemed the parts & cashier persons were not in the mood to be working.

It was difficult to give this visit experience a one star.

There is one more scheduled visit that needs to be performed for the new vehicle but after that will not be going back to Fort Bend Toyota.   Fred Bultman",1.8

12,"January 15, 2018",I bought your 2017 Tacoma since March 2017 with loud noise in rear. I took the truck many times to complaint and all I got was a run around with bs from your service reps. Greg is the only one of your whole team recognized the problem and got it fix once and for all. Hurray to Greg. I will only trust Greg and no one else in your service team. The rest of the team is unprofessionally running off your customers with very limited knowledge if your products.,5.0

20,"January 05, 2018",We bought a pre-owned Lexus from Fort Bend Toyota several years ago and decided to go back for a replacement vehicle.  We found the sales team to be eager and helpful in assisting us. They had a good selection and offered better prices over the internet. Our original sales representative was now in financing so he assigned us to another salesman.  Each time we went to test drive a vehicle they were very helpful and informative. The various members of the sales team knew the vehicles well and were able to answer all our questions. After looking at several vehicles and comparing with choices from Carmax we choose a pre-owned RAV4 from Fort Bend Toyota which gave us the best price..  I also took my Camry there for service recently and the service department was very helpful.,5.0

23,"December 30, 2017",I liked how quick the buying process was without any hassles but what ruined the experience is after I bought my Tundra and left it at their location to change the leather seats I came back to pick it up and a nice pair of leather gloves I had left at the front passenger seat of the truck were gone so someone took them. It’s unfortunate that I left my gloves there but it doesn’t mean someone should take advantage and steal them. Other than that it was awesome working with Charlie he was friendly and a good salesman. ,4.2
24,"December 29, 2017",The employees were Nice and courteous. It did take a little longer than expected with the service requested.  When I called back to get my wheel lock they were really apologetic (I know is happens sometimes when busy)    I'll be back again for my next scheduled maintenance ,5.0
25,"December 29, 2017"," It was very easy to make an appointment. When I got to the dealership to leave my car was told it was gonna be 2 1/2 hours. They seemed very rushed and bust. But it was only a one and a half hour wait. No complaints other than the fact that I asked for my car to be washed and when I got my car back it was still pretty dirty  in the back and windows were very spotty, even though they said they washed it.",4.4
26,"December 29, 2017","The staff at Fort Bend Toyota quickly and effectively worked on the purchase of the pre-owned car, described and went over its features, and quickly and effectively worked to sign all the necessary documents for the purchase.",4.8
27,"December 28, 2017","Bought a used 2016 Nissan Altima from the dealer and decided to return it the NEXT day for the following reasons.
1) Since I was buying a used rental car with over 40k miles, I wanted to do a pre-purchase inspection. My salesman talked me out of it saying it is necessary because they do their own 19 point inspection that does everything that a PPI does and even showed me all the paperwork including car fax. 
2) Did the inspection the next day after buying it, found that it was involved in a wreck. Different paint job, rear bumper not properly aligned, EXHUST FALLING OFF. 
3) They also found that the tires treading  and brake pads was below the standards. They told me this car would have NEVER passed inspection. 
3) After i signed everything to buy the car, I WAS GIVEN ONE KEY. My salesman didn't think to tell me that there was one key until after the fact. When I asked to have the price to accommodate for that, they denied it. I ask for them to make me a replacement, denied because they are Toyota. Asked for any services to compensate, NOTHING.


Overall this dealership HIDES important facts about the car. There is no way in xxxx they would have never knew this car was not part of an accident. I was guaranteed that the car was in good conditions according to their standards. Well their standards must be full of crap then because I am never buying a car here and I reccomend you guys not too as well or if you will do a pre-purchase inspection. ",1.2
28,"December 28, 2017","After picking a car it was to late to drive the 70 miles before closing. But after the salesman said he would pull the keys and we could pick it up at 9 am the next day.we made arrangements to take days off got the cash to pay the 17k in full we get a text saying they sold the car . i wont never trust them again they just dont tell the truth.

29,"December 28, 2017","I absolutely hate buying a new vehicle, not because I hate new cars but because I hate the mind games the dealerships play.  I said, ""Forget it.  I don't want a new car. I don't deserve being lied to and talked down to.""  And then I went to Fort Bend Toyota.  What a pleasant surprise!!  Garrett, our salesman, went above and beyond to get us into the car we wanted.  No high pressure sales.  No lies.  Nothing but respect.  The respectful attitude of the  GM and Sales Manager were like nothing I've ever experienced.  Go see Garrett at Ft Bend Toyota.  I promise you won't be disappointed!",5.0

32,"December 26, 2017","I will not coming back to this dealership anymore and not recommend any one to go to Fort Bend Toyota . This is a worst place to buy a vehicle. On 12/22/2017 I went to this place to get a car. We had agreed to on a price and then I went to pick my mother up to do the paperwork. Before I walked out the dealership, there were 2 gentlemen laughing at me and made a bet on me that I not coming back. One of them is Alex, the other I don't know his name. 45 minutes later, we were at Fort Bend Toyota dealership again. Alex seem really unhappy and said ""I don't want to sale you the car"". I think we lost his bet to the other gentleman and he did not sale us the car to waste our time.

43,"December 10, 2017","Purchased a prior vehicle from this dealership with no issues.  

Different story this time.  Although, new  sales rep was friendly he wasn’t sure of the process/paperwork needed to finalize the sale.  We were allowed to leave the lot with out temporary paper plates.  I assumed this was an automatic practice when sale is done.  Sales rep initially refuse to acknowledge his mistake and somewhat started to push the blame on other ( including us).

Pricing- the final price of the vehicle was reasonable there was an “option charge”  added which I did not ask for but they refused to remove (not a deal breaker) but annoying nonetheless. 

Although, the ending sales price of the vehicle was  good, there definitely need some improvement on the training and customer service.  

This experience will definitely question bringing back my business. ",3.0

When this issue was brought to the dealership's attention, their only offered solution to their mistake was changing the APR back to the agreed upon one, but charging us about 1700 dollars more to the remaining balance of the car!

97,"September 16, 2017","I brought my truck into Fort Bend Toyota for recall work 2 weeks ago. During the repair, the Toyota tech took suspension parts off and forgot to put them back on the rear suspension which was unrelated to the airbag recall I came in for. The truck was clearly unsafe to drive, pointed at the sky like a rocket, and I had to show them the missing parts they didn't know about. Thankfully the airbag was repaired since I had to take the shakey truck home. Days after I emailed the GM I got a call from a Service Manager trying to talk me into different parts. After having to negotiate, they agreed to fix the suspension (but made me pay out of pocket for parts they damaged) and detail the truck. When I picked up my truck they didn't want to do the detail, only a car wash, and finally brought the truck back covered in dirt and wouldn't touch the interior.

128,"August 02, 2017","After dealing with Ford all of my life, I decided to switch things up and visit a place by home. I was greeted several times by sales folks asking to help me find the right person. They didn't hound me to buy anything just wanted to get me in front of who I came to see. When I did, I was happily greeted and sat down for some conversation about my situation and wanting to get into something better affordable. Nathan took the time to understand and relate, his next course was to figure out what exactly for my needs. Taking into account my style, he got the car right the first time and ended up being the one I bought. Not bad for the first car, usually this process takes 2-3 hours at ford. Next I'll mention the ease of dealing with financing and moving forward with that process. It's a process everyone hates. I especially hate it because this takes 4-5 hours at ford and might have to come back for another beating the following day. Door in to drive out took 2 hours and 33miutes. We had some paperwork issues which I came back for, later in the week, but was resolved in 10 minutes time. Nothing that made me feel uncertain about the deal. I can happily say this was the easiest car buying experience I've had (and I'm on my 7th car).

150,"May 25, 2017","**This is an update to the original review below**

After reading my review of Fort Bend Toyota, Jim Smith (Service Director) took it upon himself to contact me. This was in attempt to resolve my issue. He proved to be incapable of helping.
I made an appointment with him the day after posting this review at 2PM in his office. Someone was in his office already. He quickly handed off the problem to one of his employees. A gentleman name Omar. I will give you a description as there are two that work there. He has short hair, well groomed, Hispanic.

I didn’t take my own advice and I allowed Omar to help me. I should have requested Robert or Julie like I said but I trusted that Jim was setting me up with someone who could help.
Omar was also not capable of helping.

He “ordered” the part I needed and told me it would be ready within a week or two. This was April 8, 2017 I was comfortable waiting that amount of time.
I waited well over a month and still hadn’t gotten a phone call from Omar to update me on the status of my warranty claim. So May 17,2017 after I couldn’t get Omar or Jim on the phone I drove up the Fort Bend Toyota. Turns out Omar didn’t order the part.

In fact he lied to me. He nervously shuffled papers around on his desk. While refusing to make eye contact when speaking and said “I was just back there two days ago and it still didn’t arrive in. I don’t know man, it must be on back order or something.” I knew something in that statement wasn’t true. I’m not comfortable being lied to by anyone in the service industry. Certainly not when it comes to my car.

I asked him to stop working on my warranty claim and give the job over to Julie. ” Omar agreed and that was the end of my contact with him. This was all on May 17, 2017.

That day Julie called me to let me know she’s working on it. She’s good, I mean good. She got the part for my car in today May 24, 2017 just one week.

As for Jim Smith… Any capable manager would have followed up with Omar that same day to make sure everything was ordered and taken care of. No… I take that back. Any capable manager would have taken care of it himself.

**End of update to review, keep reading for original.**
NEVER, NEVER, NEVER let Tuan help you.
Tuan is horrible! No customer service skills at all. This would be a ONE star if it wasn't for Julie and Robert. Always ask the name of your service advisor. If the name is Tuan, request a new advisor. He will tell you that warranty services, are not covered under your warranty. I very nearly spent close to $2,000 on items covered under my warranty! Two grand, when I didn't need to spend a penny. I'm disgusted with the services I got from Tuan. The way he talked to me was as if I was a dog. My car was the doghouse. $30,000 doghouse.
These are his words, ""You HAVE to pay for this. There is nothing we can do for you unless you buy the parts and labor"" Keep in mind these parts are covered under my warranty with NO deductible. I literally needed to pay nothing. As of the date of this review Tuan unfortunately still works at Fort Bend Toyota. So be careful! He is so bad. Just horrible.
If you need to come here, request Julie, or Robert.
You ""can"" request a specific advisor on the site and app. When you get there it is going to be first come first serve. No matter who you select, when you drive up it's first come first serve. When you get there this is what you need to say. ""Hello I have a (appointment time) with Robert (or Julie) I will wait here until either person is available."" Allow the person that approaches after that to introduce themselves.
Julie and Robert are freaking amazing. No words can say how happy I am with those two. These are the only two people there that will care as much about your car as you do. I'm telling you, if they're not available, drive your car away! For the sake of your car, drive it away! Only Julie and Robert appreciate your investment.
When it all comes down to it, you've invested a lot here. How can you trust someone to handle it properly, if they don't respect your investment?
Don't dick your car around. Julie. Robert. No one else.",1.8

But not so fast, the moment I received my car after my oil change, I noticed SCRATCHES on the driver's side panel and my CB antenna base spring mounting was BENDED.

I stopped in the first time out of convenience, because it’s right down the road, but continue to take my FJ there because of the customer service. They have always been fast, friendly and courteous. 
Now I’ve never written a review before, but my most recent experiences there for a couple of warranty and repair issues were so exceptional, they deserve to be noted. For the first 2 years I hadn’t had anything but oil changes and tire rotations done and I’ve been very pleased, but now after going in for warranty/repair work, I know that any repair I can’t do in my driveway will definitely be done there. 
I was greeted at the door by John Williams, the Service Director. He listened to me, and didn’t give me the ole’ “I’ll drive it around the block and if I don’t hear, feel, or see it, you’re outta luck” line. He didn’t even laugh when I tried to replicate the noises myself! With his help, everything was taken care of, and I’m very pleased.
It’s a shame that normally, people leave a review only when they are dissatisfied. I feel certain if people reviewed their positive experiences, FBT’s ratings would be thru the roof!
Thanks again to John and the service staff.  FBT rocks!

I bought a truck here in February and was very happy with the purchase and the experience. That euphoria lasted about 16 hours. The very first morning that I got in to drive to work the dash board lit up like a Christmas tree with anywhere from 3-5 warning lights on at different times. I took the truck to a closer Toyota dealership to have them look at it and they were unable to find the problem but they did find something very interesting. There were records in the truck's computer that indicated that Ft. Bend had read 4 trouble codes a few days before they sold me the truck but they did not disclose those to me. When I asked them about it they sent me a sheet that indicated the health check on the truck carried no trouble codes. It turns out they had cleared all the codes and printed out a clean sheet 10 minutes after the initial reading. The other Toyota dealership had all the proof right there on the computer screen. When I went back to Ft Bend with the information I was rudely hung up on and told I bought the truck as is. I'm very disappointed in the way Ft Bend handled this and I feel that they acted in a fraudulent manner to clear the codes no less than 10 minutes after they read them the first time. I will not be back to this location and would advise against doing business with them.

Sales reps recommended test drives, didn't try to sell me things I didn't want, and were open to hearing about what brought me in. A distracted driver totaled my 2001 camry, and as a result, I had to find something fast. Knowledgeable staff worked with me, patiently might I add (it was the first time for me to buy a car), as I had lots of questions. The web listings for all vehicles I saw matched the stickers on the cars when I got there. The quality of the vehicle I bought was better than described online. I was very impressed with the entire buying process. The Finance guy even text me back and forth when I knew that I couldn't make it in the same day to check the car out, updating me that the car was still there etc. After having a car sold out from under us at Sterling McCall, that was so reassuring. So, if you want to buy a car from a human being, Fort Bend Toyota is the place to go!

I reached dealership around 12:10 PM and was made to wait for 20 minutes before I was informed that Mr. Popejoy was not available and that someone else would assist me. I was later assisted by Mr. Shatry who was very courteous. However, Mr. Shatry appeared to be a junior salesman who had no clue about the car availability. I was again made to wait for a long time before Mr. Pasquale (new car sales manager) came in and curtly informed me that they did not have any RAV4 LE models. He then tried to get me into buying a XLE model that he had in stock. 
Mr. Popejoy was in the floor walking around when I asked him if he had a minute to talk to me. He snapped saying that he did not have a minute. However I persisted and reminded Mr. Popejoy about our conversation the previous day about 4 cars being available. I was given a vague reply “they were sold out” before he walked away. Both Mr. Popejoy and Mr. Pasquale were very rude in their demeanor and approach. Mr. Pasquale could not even tell me for sure when he will have a car. His explanation was that RAV4s were so ‘in demand’ and that “they were flying off the shelves” so he couldn’t predict how long they will stay in his lot.  He even suggested that I buy my car from San Antonio if I could not drive back and forth to Houston multiple times to try and catch a car when it was available. He further assured me that none of the dealers in Houston had RAV4 LE in stock and couldn’t even trade one for me. At this point I was thinking to myself to buy a Honda CR-V if RAV4s were so hard to get. 
However I also had a quote from Mr. Sarwar Khan at Sterling McCall Toyota in Houston. He had told me the previous day that he had about 6 RAV4 LEs available. I went upto his dealership and had a very positive experience. The price quote and descriptions over email/telephone was accurate and staff was courteous and attentive. As a result I was able to buy a RAV4 LE from them. 
I still have no idea why Fort Bend Toyota personnel were dishonest to me multiple times. First, they lied about what they had in stock to lure me into the showroom even though they knew I was driving from far. Next they tried to convince me to by a RAV4 XLE AWD that I did not want. Last, they lied to me saying there were no RAV4 LEs available anywhere in Houston to trade. They did not really seem to want my business and was never apologetic for what happened. 
I am hoping that you would be able to contact the dealership and help make sure that more customers don’t have similar experience. I also would like for you to forward this mail to the management at Fort Bend so they know what is really going on at their dealership.

225,"February 03, 2013","I agree with other reviews about this dealership having two personalities. they are very friendly and helpful, but only until you hit a road block. after that, things change fast. 

I live 2 miles away from this dealership, but I will never consider them again for any of my future Toyota purchases. I will state my case in a very fair manner. 

I went to this dealership to look for a new car, and they had the model I wanted in stock. bibin helped me with the test drive and I liked the car. we then went in to talk about colors available and pricing. he said the color I want was coming in 5 days, and I agreed to wait. then when it came to pricing, I told him that I had offers from other dealers, so he called in Dave. we went over costs, and bibin agreed to beat and any written offer with vin # by $250. I emailed both of them written offer with vin # on it and went in the following morning. things had changed now. after 20 mins of waiting, bibin came to his desk and now quoted me a new price which was $3000 MORE than what was discussed with Dave. he went on to say that they sell to people who pay them more than the market price, and that the car which was coming in 5 days was not for sale. he then went on to say that he didn't want to waste anymore of my time, essentially implying that I was  wasting theirs. I smiled, shook his hand, thanked him for his efforts, waved at Dave, and left. I'm never going there again. 

if you don't mind paying more than the market price on your new cars, then these guys would work for you. they will treat you with respect, and won't pass any sarcastic comments either. but if you are looking for competitive prices on new Toyotas, then I would suggest you drive up north to fred haas toyota world in spring, tx where I ended buying my car. read my review on them. they will treat you right. 

Anyways, I wish them all the best.

226,"January 18, 2013","me and my sister went to get her a new car.  in the beginning everybody was very nice and even nicer when we put down a large down payment in cash.  later our loan was denied by toyota financial and then they wouldnt answer phone calls.  got a phone call from eric demanding i bring the car back with an attitude and a really harsh tone.  without explaining that the loan had been denied.  we didnt find out the loan was denied till 3 days later.  paul archer our salesman didnt know half of what was going on and kept asking for different papers every other day.  we made about a dozen trips to the dealership and overall a horrible experience.  theyre very nice and friendly in the beginning to help you pick out a car but after that it gets really bad because they assume they already have the sale so theres no point in being nice or prompt.   will never go there again and will advise everyone to not go there.

228,"December 30, 2012","I went to this dealership to buy a new car and was very disappointed in the experience. Being a young female I was immediately discriminated against at the dealership. Although I was the one buying a car not a single person spoke or sold to me. Instead they spoke and asked questions to my fiancee who came along while shopping. During the course of this all my fiancee several times let them know that they need to be asking all questions to me since he had nothing to do with the car and was not even on any of the loan documents. The deal breaker was when Amir Garek and Eric Johnson called in my fiancee to speak about the terms of the loan and various different products. I thought that they may have been mistaken so I went into the office and was told to leave because they only wanted to speak to my fiancee at the moment and would call me in when the time was right. My fiancee came out and let me know that they went over the terms of the loan, and offered various different types of products and when he voiced his concern over why he was being asked this and not the actual buyer he was brushed off. I later was called in and just told to sign paperwork. The customer service of both Amir Garek and Eric Johnson was absolutely horrendous.Nothing was explained or offered. We got sick of the whole experience and went to another Toyota dealership- STERLING McCALL TOYOTA and bought a car. I got a good deal on my car there, a very low interest rate, and most importantly I was dealt with professionalism!

 As an educated professional I was appalled by the lack of professionalism and training these two individuals had throughout the course of doing business. I think it is important that the dealership and industry know that the economy and the way of doing business has changed. There are far more young professionals and women out there that are going out and buying cars and they should be dealt with professionalism and in the same way a man or older person is. 

I do not recommend this dealership to anyone. ",1.4

Then one day a Fort Bend advertisement came in the mail so hey. Why not right at least find out. I talked to Daniel and he was superb. I told him exactly what I wanted and he found it immediately. I took the long drive out there from north Houston complaining that it better be worth it and I left the happiest person!!!! Daniel is great, nice, funny, easy to talk to. He is like an old high school buddy you are buying a car with. Then the dreaded financing part came up. Jimmy Kimble. Mr Trekkie himself was awesome!!!!! I got the deal of a lifetime. I am a single mother and every dollar counts. He totally understood that and didn't make me feel uncomfortable about it. I think sometimes I settled for a higher car note not wanting to make myself feel as broke as I do at the end of paying bills. But Jimmy was so cool and understanding. I didn't have to push the issue. He saved me about 80 bucks monthly not to mention better discounts on my insurance. I couldn't recommend them any higher than physically shouting it to the top if my lungs. I Wholeheartedly recommend this dealership and the people I worked with.

After he did our paperwork they threw it in someones inbox and it set their for 45 minutes while we waited on finance.  I asked finance person if they were ready for us and he told us he wasn't doing anything for us  (he was joking and kidding around in another office).  I told sales manager we were leaving in 15 minutes if we were not done so he than started running around looking for our paperwork.  When they finally found it they sent it to finance and they had us in soon.  Finance man ran paperwork and took first deal with over 15% interest.  I thought they would at least try to find you a good interest rate.  After I told him forget it, he immediated found one under 10%.  I still wasn't happy but I just wanted to get out of their and since we will be paying it off soon it didn't matter.  We also had a 2010 camery that were trying to get rid of.  It had 6 months left on its lease and we wanted to know the trade in so we could get rid of it soon and get something else we wanted.  A different internet manager tryed to tell us to turn the car in six months and they would roll the six months payment into the tundra.  What does he think customers are--stupid.

My husband, daughter and I arrived at the dealership one very windy, cold day and was immediately met by Andy Lorance. He assessed our needs and went to work getting vehicles for me to test drive. Because we were on a tight schedule, we could not stay beyond testing driving the cars he selected. By the time we left though, my daughter was interested in purchasing a car too. We left, but couldn't get back to the dealership for several weeks.

Garrett Burleson was available and I told him what my needs were and he set about letting us test drive the cars I asked about.

I drove the Highlander and he was right! I loved it, but again, being on a tight schedule, we had to leave with promises of returning that very evening. 
We returned at 9pm that evening and Garrett was waiting for us. I decided to buy the Highlander because it suited my needs and after driving it, I didn't want to car shop any longer.

He came up with good numbers and got me an excellent price for my trade-in. This is our fifth Toyota to buy and we have been pleased on nearly every deal. FT. Bend Toyota was competitive with other Toyota dealers in the Houston area and were close to our neighborhood.
We were a little disappointed with the finance manager who could have gotten us a little better interest rate on our financing. He misrepresented his ""buy rate"" from Toyota Motor Finance. Toyota Motor Finance was providing an excellent rate for new truck buyers at the time for buyers with excellent credit rating and it was not offered to us. However, I realize that is part of his job to make as much as possible on any finance deal.

Just wanted to express my sincere gratitude to Ike and the Fort Bend Toyota Team.

The service was Outstanding!  In other words, Super Supreme!

I was totally amazed and extremely satisfied with my experience at the Fort Bend Toyota Dealership on Friday, Jan. 27.  

I was very impressed with Ike.  He was so professional, honest, and knowledgable about the Toyota Corolla and explained to me the differences between the Toyota and Honda cars.  There was a time where I was interested in the Honda Civic, but thanks to Ike, he indicated to me in several examples why the Toyota was a better choice.  

He made me feel so comfortable and I never felt under pressure to purchase a car that day but everything felt so right and I was totally convinced that the Toyota Corolla was a perfect fit for me.

I was so overwhelmed at the way he explained all the interior features and components to me.  He covered everything so thoroughly and in such great detail.

Ike really goes the extra mile with his pleasant disposition, honesty, and integrity projecting a positive image for the company.  I would highly recommend Ike for a promotion as he goes above and beyond the call of duty! 

Again, thank you so much for your Outstanding Customer Service.  As a satisfied customer, it's been a pleasure doing business with you and I will definitely be back.

Sincerely,

Very Satisfied Customer

Eric Johnson in the finance department was very hospitable and professional. He is to be commended on a job well done on a very complex deal. A combination of two trades, and many other factors, could have made this a very uncomfortable deal, but he got it done very effortlessly.

294,"January 14, 2012","I researched the cost of many cars (Honda, Nissan, Ford) before finally choosing Fort Bend Toyota and purchasing an XLE Camry.   After many different quotes I checked the prices with Kelly Blue Book and was contacted by Fort Bent Toyota's Nay Htet.   Nay contacted me within a few hours and gave me a no-nonsence price for the car I wanted.

When I visited with Fort Bend Toyota on a Friday afternoon - Nay was present to greet me and to show me the car that was in stock.  The service was excellent and the main reason for the purchase was the service received and then the price.

Before the visit with Nay and Fort Bend Toyota - I visited with Don McGill Toyota 3 times at the two dealership.  The representatives at Don McGill were rude and tried to sell me a lot of add-ons to the vehicles such as lifetime tint for $400, Lifetime Nitrogen another $400 and many more dealer add-ons that increased th eprice by >$2000!!!!    The representatiev also told me that he was not hurting is I did not buy the car and Toyota was not suffering and if I did not buy it someone else would.   Strange that I was also not contacted by Consumer Report after the visits by Don McGill - guess that the salesmen did not really want to receive feedback on the visit.

I had almost given up on Toyota and was moving onto a HOnda Accord before I was contacted by Nay at Fort Bend.

I received all the information I needed and was treated with respect and dignity - and given a good price - I bought the car.   Thanks to one shining example of customer service - Nay Htet.

He was very helpful and had so much knowledge of all features of the 2012 Camry. Initially, we were looking for a 2012 Camry LE with the add-on of alloy wheels. However, Jose informed us that the price of the 2012 Camry SE is very close to how much the LE (+ alloy wheels) would cost. In his words, he wanted to give us ""more bang for our buck"" since the SE comes with more features. And clearly, we definitely did! He explained all the features and differences between the LE and SE and was very attentive & extremely helpful. I've never encountered a salesman like him before. I usually feel uncomfortable around car salesmen due to previous experiences at other dealers, but not this time. He made it very easy to talk to him and to ask him questions. Even though I went to two Toyota dealers before this one, there were so many features of the Camry that I had no idea about until Jose informed me of them. In addition, he didn't bother to give us the highest price to initiate what would be a long negotiation. Instead, he just went straight to the lowest price he was authorized to offer and the negotiation continued from there. Now that's how you do it. It saves time and gets straight to the main point. My dad & I picked up the car a couple of days ago from them, and I'm absolutely in love with it!

My family and I arrived and after looking at the showroom cars for a bit, we asked to speak to a sales rep and we were taken care of right away(One very good thing I liked about this dealership was that there was no one waiting outside at the front doors, waiting to just grab you the minute you get out of your car and try to sell you a car - we were able to do things at our own pace and I really appreciated that). Even though we said that we were familiar with the car from test driving it at other places and were just looking for a good price at this point, our salesperson insisted that we at least take the car for a drive just in case we did settle on this car today to make sure there was nothing about it we didn't like. The last dealership we said this to just took us straight to the tables without even letting us sit inside the car - so I was very surprised by the honesty of the salesperson at this dealership.
All our car buying experiences have been defined by how it all started and I felt very comfortable walking in from the beginning and going at my own pace and never once felt rushed about the whole thing(not even we our family took 30 minutes just deciding on a color..)

If their pledge to &quot;Customer Service&quot; means a Salesman misrepresenting to sell a truck with lack of concern for safety, then they've succeeded!  A+ for Misrepresentation.  I was looking to upgrade my Tundra for a specific use. This was an upgrade in a Tundra 4.6L to a 5.7L.  I was repeatedly reassured it would serve its purpose in towing a specific weight and trailer, later to learn it can't, not safely with lack of concern from the dealership.   If their pledge to &quot;Customer Service&quot; means later having to speak to a &quot;Manager&quot; about a Sour Deal and a Salesman who either lied or didn't know enough about the product then they get an A+ for a &quot;manager&quot; to shrug his shoulders with a frown, walk away and say &quot;it's not his problem&quot;.  I am a 3rd time Toyota Owner.  First and Last time with this dealership who have now turned their backs once my money was in their hands.  I've now had to escalate my situation to Corporate about the problem at hand. Making a major purchase is stressful enough.  I went in as an educated consumer but had the wool pulled over my eyes with this dealership.  If your in the market for a Toyota, I would advise that you take your business and hard earned money to a dealership that cares because you won't find it here at Fort Bend Toyota with their poor business ethics and lack of &quot;Customer Service&quot;.  Shame on me for believing.  Shame on them for misrepresenting.  Yes, I have a good truck, that's why I chose to purchase a Tundra in the first place.   What upsets me the most is how I was treated after the matter especially by a Manager and salesperson who poorly represents Toyota quality.

My husband, Marc & I were stopping by several Toyota dealerships in the Houston area looking to see the new Camry & colors.  When we arrived at Fort Bend, we were greeted by Jose Martell who is actually the Internet Manager.  He showed us a 2012 Camry SE & called to let us know when he received a XLE in which what we were interested in.  Jose was so courteous, friendly & attentive that we decided to drive to Fort Bend again.  After introducing us to Jeff Pasquale, Sales Manager (who actually greeted me by name the next time we were in), Jose spent quality time with us explaining all about the new XLE Camry---believe me, he was very knowledgeable about every aspect. After several phone calls & emails answering all of my questions about price, etc., we made another trip at which time we made our purchase.  Jose was so patient, kind, polite & I was impressed with the way he treated me with respect--a woman, making a car deal.  He got the exact car I wanted from another dealership & it was presented in excellent condition.  Then he met with Eric Johnson, Finance Manager.  After purchasing many Toyotas in the past, this has not been our favorite experience.  But Eric made it very painless & worked with us in a timely fashion with our budget, warranty & interest rate.  He was great & everyone in the dealership seemed to have a good rapport with each other, including the young lady behind the desk (Jose introduced me but I forgot her name) from whom I purchased a headlight bulb for my old Camry.
While intending on buying a vehicle at our local dealership, I am happy to say that I was glad we stopped in & met Jose Martell.  He was very professional & non-pushy while still providing for all our needs.

When we arrived at the dealership the car was ready for us. Dave greeted us and was very friendly. As we test drove the car Dave again answered all of our questions.  Throughout the negotiations process, we felt that Dave was very friendly, very professional and very fair.  We eventually agreed on a price that my wife and I thought was very fair and affordable.

367,"September 22, 2011","The sales experience was smooth but the financing part was dissapointing because the finance guy (Mr. Johnson) was not aware of the details of a Collage Graduate Rebate program and I had to give him the in and outs of the program nevertheless he was reluctant to give me a ""no payments for the first 90 days"" benefit. The finance guy called the sales person because he asked us who told us about the benefit (when it's clearly stated in their own website) and this made it worse because the sales person (Mr. Sanchez) acted defensive and started experimenting with several situations to get out of the program benefit such as ""if you want that benefit we have to increase the price of the car to make up for those 90 days"", or ""oh! then we have to add a couple of more dollars to your monthly payment"" or ""in that case the last payment will be a bigger payment to cover those 90 days"" so they couldn't even get their story straight.
The way they managed the interest rate is also lame.  To sale other services I was quoted a rate of 5.5% and to include other services they made it look like a favor that my rate would be reduced to 3.75% so my payments would be within my estimated desired payment. The following day I brought up this situation to another dealer from the same dealer group and they were surprised with the way they handled the situation, they even informed me that I qualified for the 3.75% all the time!
I simple ""I'm not sure about this, let me find out"" would have satisfied me and I would've waited for a definitive answer but when they started inventing explanations of why I could't get that benefit or wanting to change the terms of what was already negotiated then it stopped being a financing issue and it became a customer service and honesty issue.
I went to the other dealer the very next day and they were able to find out what they were unsure of and we closed the sale with benefit that was negated to me on the Fort Bend Toyota dealership.

Our Finance Manager, Eric Johnson, helped us to get those payments where we needed them.  He was a very pleasant young man and didn't pressure us into purchasing anything we didn't want.

I've never had a salesperson like Ike, he was very thorough in explaining all the knobs and buttons!  He took extra time with us to explain how every single thing works on our new car.  How nice not to have to look up everything in the book!  He even explained which books or booklets contained the information he was showing us.  
Best of all, he didn't freak out when we said we had to go get some lunch but we'd be back.  Most salesmen know that once a prospective customer leaves the lot, they might not come back, so they really high pressure you into staying.  But, he just said, ""okay, see you when you get back.""  We ate our lunch and discussed which car we really would like  to have and returned to the dealership and Ike continued working with us and answered all our questions. Ike helped us to have a GREAT experience in buying our new car!

388,"August 22, 2011","I highly recommend Fort Bend Toyota. They found the truck that I wanted when two other dealers basically didn’t want to take the time to look around for what I wanted. One told me that it would take weeks the other tried to sell me something I didn’t want that was in his stock.
Both Jim Wilkinson and Nay jumped right in, found what I wanted in Austin TX, then had it delivered quickly.
The paperwork and delivery went great and I drove out in my new Tacoma a very happy customer. Would defiantly recommend this dealership to my friends.

He also spent extra time making sure I was informed of all features in the car and how to operate them.  I typically read the owners manuals but this preliminary overview was sufficient on its own.  I plan to but a new vehicle in the next year and I will definitely work with him again.

Trey (don't have last name on hand) in finance was very help and professional as well.  He covered all the additional options available and I ended up purchasing a long term warranty.  I typically don't purchase extended warranties but he did a good job sharing the benefits while not pressuring the sale.  

I would recommend them both to others and if I decide to acquire another Toyota will work with them directly.

418,"June 28, 2011","The overall experience at the Fort Bend Toyota dealership is good. When we arrived at the dealership, Fredi, the internet manager had our car ready for the test drive. We test drove the car but decided not to take it because of the miles it has for a new car. It had 400 miles on it. So, we went on with other cars and Fredi was very patient and showed us other cars. He was never pushy and did not force us into taking one over the other. We went to the dealership with a price in our mind and the options that we want, AM/FM with bluetooth option and Security system option. But there are no cars at the dealership that have both the options. Finally we went with a Corolla which has the blue tooth option, but it came with another package ""Vehicle Shield package"". Because of this package, I had to pay $250 more than we originally planned. I was told by many of my friends that this package is sold in the Gulf states area and is totally useless. Fredi said that there is no way that he can take that package out of the car's price and I ended up paying for an option that I don't need. I could've used that money to install a security system which is more important to me. Added to this, when I went to the Finance manager to sign the credit application, he tried to sell me a Vehicle shield package (approx. $695) along with the extended warranty. When I told him that I bought the Corolla with the vehicle shield package, then he said that package is not really great and that the product he is selling is far more superior than the standard dealer added option. At this point we were really frustrated because of the additional amount we had to pay for a package which is useless (even in the dealership's opinion). This is the only reason I had to give a rating of 3 on the price. Other than this, every thing is great and I would strongly recommend Fort Bend Toyota dealership to any Toyota vehicle buyer. Contact Fredi via email and he is very prompt in returning mails immediately. By the way, ""Nay"" (sales associate) is very friendly to talk to and took good care of us. You can't miss him when you are in the dealership. Thank you Fredi and Nay for your help in the buying process.",4.6

420,"June 26, 2011","Fort Bend Toyota uses autotrader.com  to lure customers onto their lot with extremely misleading price quotes for your trade in. 

If you go to their website the autotrader.com logo is incorporated into the Fort Bend website masthead. If you fill out all of the information you are instantly given a price quote and told to print it out and take it to the dealer where they will review the quote against their own inspection. 

After getting a price quote of $7,400 for my Jeep Wrangler I drove a long way to the dealer to see if they would honor this. I immediately told the first two salesmen why I was there and that the trade-in value had to be met in order to do any deal. I gave the ""Internet"" salesman the printed paper with the account code number listed on it. He assured me he would ""take care of it""  Yeah, I'm sure you can see where this is going.... 

After well over an hour of insisting to show me details of their Tacoma Trucks he finally sat me down and offered me a trade-in value of $4300 for my jeep. Stunning. I was expecting them to try an come off the auto trader.com quote some but that amount was really insulting since it was even lower than two price quotes of $5000 from two other Toyota dealers I had received the day before.

After having to ask for my keys back 3 times to no avail, I finally walked into the office an had to demand them to give me back my keys.  When I turned to leave I told the salesman he had wasted my time. He quickly informed me that I had wasted his time. Stunning.

430,"June 19, 2011","I live in the Dallas area and had been looking for a good used 2000-2003 Toyota Solara for my daughter, who just graduated high-school.  After exhausting a Dallas area search using AutoTrader and CraigsList, I widened the AutoTrader search to 500 miles, locating a Silver 2003 SLE at Fort Bend Toyota, just outside of Houston. I called the Internet Sales number and left a voice-mail to see if it was still available... Clay Wilson called back within an hour.  After talking with Clay several times, letting him know my situation, asking many questions via phone and numerous e-mails, a strong sense of trust was quickly established... he answered every question, took additional photos I requested, got some additional work done on the vehicle and sent new photos.  In short, I got so confident working with Clay that I decided for both my daughter and I to fly down from Dallas to see the vehicle with about 90% confidence that we'd purchase it.  Clay picked us up at Hobby Airport and brought us to the dealership, and before even seing the vehicle, I became impressed with Fort Bend's facility... very open and comfortable... clean with friendly people.  We relaxed at a little bar for about 30 minutes, having some coffee and soda while waiting for the car to be detailed.  When Clay took us to see it, it was parked just outside the doors in the shade, spotless inside and out, with a full tank of gas... he just handed us the key for a test drive, during which my daughter loaded up 6 CDs in the player to check it all out, and then cranked up the music.  My 10% of doubt vanished after a few minutes of driving.  After driving several miles both on and off the highway, we were headed back to the dealership when my daughter asked, ""Dad, should I just leave the CDs in the player?""  Yes, the CDs stayed in, and we enjoyed listening to them during the long, but very enjoyable drive back to Dallas in a lovely used vehicle.  I have to say, I never, ever thought I'd buy a car over the internet, but it worked out really well working with Clay Wilson and Fort Bend Toyota!  I feel lucky to have found them!

431,"June 16, 2011","This was an awesome experience compared to my previous experiences with car dealers. Jose Martell was our salesman and we had requested him based on a reference from a friend. When we went into the dealer Jose was not in yet, but a very friendly Clay Wilson called Jose to let him know we were there and then showed us around while we waited. While looking around we found the Toyota Rav4 that we purchased and we were able to complete the deal when Jose arrived. We financed the car through Toyota and actually got a better interest rate than my credit union which has never happened before. The car needed to be detailed(had just arrived on lot, was not listed in inventory yet) and had a smell of smoke which they gladly had the car fumegated through some type of process and the car was ready a few days later. Oh yeah, can't forget that they gave us a loaner car while waiting for them to tidy up our car. Tidying up our car involved replacing some plastic parts that had been damaged by previous owner and even involved painting a bumper piece which matched the bumper perfectly.  Dealing with the finance office was very pleasant and of course they try to upsell you like any dealer but they were not overly pushy and answered all of our questions. Jose came into work early on two different occasions for us and went above and beyond to help us. He is a family man so we thank his family for his sacrifice of time. Also, this location has a very relaxing setting with comfortable seats and free beverages. Ok, so maybe thats not that important, but it made for a very ""at-home"" kind of feeling which I enjoyed. Typically, Im very ""business is business and forget all the frills"" but I almost didnt want to leave there when we were done. Thank you Jose, Clay, and the Toyota team, this was a great experience!

I kind of miss seeing them! Awesome representatives of Fort Bend Toyota! I initially found it difficult to not purchase what I thought was an American Made vehicle (Chevy/Ford/Dodge) but once I did my homework the truck sells itself... but I have to question why I had to do so much research on my own and why I don't see more marketing pointing out this is one of the top AMERICAN MADE vehicles or vehicles that support AMERICAN JOBS and AMERICAN WORKERS and that Ford and Chevy/GMC do not. I realize Dodge can compare but lets face it, Dodge trucks don't hold a candle to Toyota trucks! I looked at Chevy an Ford Trucks pretty hard as well and they can't compare to the Crew Max and I think Toyota Marketing should really be focusing on interior comparisons... I have also noticed that TUNDRA drivers have a wave thing going on, I get a wave every time I pass one going the opposite direction... reminds me of driving down a country road. I have big plans for my Tundra with my family and you guys should be promoting this vehicle as such... I think you guys could take over the market in 4 door trucks if you would realize you have the best one on the market in several ways and market it as such. ",5.0

He also presented me with many options and gave me his advice which I think was very good advice. He recommended me the RAV4 over the Honda CRV and showed me ratings and videos explaining why the RAV4 is a better choice. This was very helpful for me. He also advised to go with a new car to benefit from the graduate rebate a 1000$ value. Also the finance manager was very helpful and explained to me all the available packages. I was also very happy with the finance plan he offered and I bought the extended warranty. There was also an iranian guy who helped me with the insurance which i think was a great deal. I even bought insurance for my existing car saving me 200$/year.

Overall I was very satisfied with the experience and would definately recommend a friend and would definately come back if I need another vehicle.

I was introduced to Clay Wilson the sales Rep. and in his office I told him what I was looking for as for, colors, etc. He checked his inventory, found something that he thought I might be interested in and we left his office to take a look. It was exactly what I was looking for. This is the eighth new car buy I've made and the forth Toyota, the other three at Sterling McCall and this was by far the most hassle free experience ever. Cassie Hughey got me through finance as quick as that can be done and I was on my way.

449,"May 03, 2011","I can't say enough about the experience we had Ft Bend Toyota.  What stood out most was the honesty.  We visited other dealerships earlier in the day, but we were most comfortable with Ft. Bend Toyota.  It was the last day of the month and we felt the pressure to buy at the other dealerships.  Jerry Kroger our Sales Advisor at Ft Bend Toyota was honest, courteous and informative and there was no pressure to make a sale.  We took a test drive and by the time we returned we were ready to buy.  My parents were actually the ones buying the vehicle, a 2011 Toyota Venza.  My father has a hearing disability that affects him most in public places.  Jerry was very sensitive to my father’s condition and took the time to explain the vehicle’s features and later to make sure he understood the process and documents necessary to purchase the vehicle.   The deal we received on the vehicle was better than we had expected.   Let’s just say it was an offer we couldn’t refuse.  We arrived at Ft Bend Toyota later in the day than we wanted.  I appreciate Jerry Kroger and the financial staff for staying late to complete the sale.  There was no rush on their part to speed up the process so they could go home.  You would have thought we were there in the middle of the day.  Cassie Hughey, the Finance Manager, was very courteous and explained all the documents my parents need to sign.  One thing I can say about the people at Ft Bend Toyota is they are very down to earth.  Ft. Bend Toyota has gone through a few names changes over the years, but we have been buying vehicles from this dealership for the past 27 years.  I should add all of our Toyota’s over the years have always been service at Ft Bend.  The automotive Service staff is also one of the reasons we continue to return to Ft Bend Toyota.   ",5.0

The only negative thing, I did not want an extended warrenty on the car, not at all interested.  I told the loan officer this from the get go.  They 'make' you listen to the entire sales pitch which was a total waste of time.  Other than that I would highly recommend this dealership.

452,"April 30, 2011","I never liked buying cars or deal with sale people from a very unpleasant experience in the past.  But work required me to have a specific vehicle so I requested a quote via the internet and Clay Wilson from Fortbend Toyota answered my email.  He was cordial, to the point and openly honest about his business.

In person, Clay was very friendly, easy going and not at all pushy like the old car saleman image we had in mind.  We had a great time buying at Fortbend and would highly recommend Clay to anyone that's still hesitate or had a bad experience in the past dealing with pushy dealership.

The only unpleasant experience is the finance department.  The guy was very friendly, but he also was trying very hard to get us to buy extended warranty, and was still trying after we said no for the 3rd time.  Both me & my wife have degrees in Engineering, and can do math fairly well, we did not need him to educate us on how he's trying to ""save"" us money for the umpteenth time.  That offended us a great deal, but it has nothing to do with Clay Wilson or the dealship as a whole, so I don't blame them.  I also understand that the finance guy was probably just trying do his job & to make a living, so I don't blame him either, I just wish he learned to understand the people he dealt with better.",4.8

Many times, I find the process condescending and a moment where you want to tell the sales person ""do I look that foolish?"".  However, Daniel's knowledge about the vehicle and the competitor vehicle at another dealership we were considering pushed the deal through.  Had it not been for his honesty,integrity, and respect we would have likely not closed the deal as quickly as we did from the moment we began looking.  We started on Saturday and by Monday, we had our car.  I would not hesitate to recommend him to anyone looking for a vehicle.

We wanted to research a used car before buying from so far away, so we coordinated an independent inspection. The dealership was very easy and willing to work with us on this detail. The employees were so friendly, and were extremely easy to reach each time we contacted them. Our salesman even picked my husband up at the airport when he flew in to get our car. When I was finalizing the financial part of the transaction, I was 800 miles away.

473,"October 12, 2009","Back in March of this year I was rear-ended while driving home from work. I had my vehicle, a 2008 Toyota Highlander, towed to the collision center of Fort Bend Toyota. It was estimated that the repairs would take 2 months to complete. After 4 months and my car still in the body shop, I went to Fort Bend Toyota and spoke to the General Manager, Pat Goldwait. I expressed my concerns about the lack of competence of the body shop and it's manager, Jerry Shapley. He told me he was going to talk with Jerry and call me that afternoon. He never called. Another month went by and I get a call from Jerry Shapley that my vehicle is repaired and ready to be picked up. My husband and I arrive and notice right away that the left side rear panel does not align with the left rear door, the rear hatch would not close and the spare tire was missing among many more miscellaneous flaws. The vehicle stays there another month while the poor workmanship is corrected. After 6 months in the body shop, I pick up my car and take it home. About a week later an Allstate appraiser comes to the house to do a final inspection on the vehicle. It was then discovered there were parts that Allstate had paid to be replaced that were never replaced. My car then goes back to Fort Bend Toyota's Collision Center to have those parts replaced and other failed repairs redone. Another month later Jerry Shapley calls and says the car is ready. Again, my husband and I arrive to pick it up and notice the rear hatch is not aligned with the left side rear panel or the rear bumper. We pointed it out to the Collision Center's manager, Jerry Shapley, and he said ""That's as good as it's going to get"". Unhappy with the repairs and his response, we walked directly to the dealership to speak with the General Manager, Pat Goldwait. He shakes our hands and we explain our frustrations. He then goes outside and inspects the vehicle. Without saying a word, he turns and walks to the Collision Center. A few minutes later, he literally runs out of the Collision Center and runs right passed my husband and I without saying anything to us. We go back into the dealership to find him so we can discuss the issue but he is no where to be found. That was 3 days ago. He has yet to contact us and I am sure he does not intend to.

My third and current vehicle is an 07 Tundra with 96K on it.  During my most recent oil change, it was discovered that I am leaking oil and my oil pan needs to be replaced.  I have never come across this problem with any of my previous vehicles.  According to a couple of other mechanics in Houston the cause must have been one of the servicemen over tightening the oil plug.  First off, they tried to sell me the entire charge of the replacement which is about $500.  Secondly, the moment I questioned it I was told that they will pay for the labor if I pay for the parts.  If I did not say anything would they offer to pay for the labor?  My problem is the service department caused the leak and they are expecting me to pay for the replacement.  I pay for the parts including the over $100 fee for finding the leak. This is horrible customer service.  I would expect to be taken care of if the Toyota is the cause of the leak.  My truck has less than 100K miles and the oil plug does wear out but not that soon typically around 500K to 800K.  I have checked some other local mechanics, and the only cause of the leak with such few miles is over tightening of the plug.  I have been given the run around with various service personnel and have basically been told that I am ultimately responsible for the service that takes place while my truck is at the dealer.  If this does not get fixed, I will never get my truck serviced at Toyota nor will ever buy another Toyota product again.  I am an outside salesman for an oil/gas company and thus the reason why I have so many miles on my truck in such a short time.

We took it to the toyota dealership in Richmond and was told the rotors were warped and that they should have caught the problem when they certified it and because it was just out of the 3,000 mile mark, (the drive to Richmond was at least 1,000), they need an okay from the dealership that I got the vehicle.  I then called Alex Rodriguez, the used car manager at Fort Bend Toyota.  He was not helpful at all and even accused me of doing the damage myself.  I told him that another dealership is telling me that you missed it and you don't honor that?  He then told me to let the service manager at the Richmond dealership to call his service manager ""Rick Howell.""  The richmond dealership and myself tired for 2 days to get in touch with Rick or Alex, but they never responded to numerous messages.  They didn't have the common courtesy to call anyone back.
