0,"June 11, 2020","I bought an ATV from Honda of Brazosport which was owned by Honda of Lake Jackson. When I decided to sell the ATV, I realized I never received the title. I went to Honda of Lake Jackson and gave them proof that I purchased the ATV. The lady in bookkeeping (Lara) showed me the title and told me she would transfer it into my name. That conversation was almost a year ago and I still don't have the title. I will be going to Houston to today to start the process for a bonded title. A lady that I spoke to with the Texas DMV told me Honda of Lake Jackson could have easily taken care of this issue. For me, it will take a trip to Houston, $100 for a bonded title plus paying TT&L a second time to do what they could have done easily nearly a year ago. I am also curious where the $231.88 I paid originally for the TT&L went to. I'm glad I'm not having the same issue over a $70,000 automobile.",1.0
1,"June 08, 2020","Was stuck in the dealership for 4+ hours and honestly wish I had left when I was going to instead of going back in. If I could just return the vehicle I would.

I went into look at a vehicle listed online, and of course, it was no longer there. They showed me some other vehicles I didn't like then happened to have one similar to the one I wanted in the back they had just received. I should have looked it over better because it was damaged in multiple places, which was kind of surprising for a CPO. Cracked windows, had to push trim back on, scratches on interior, etc.

After test driving the car they tried giving me a price that was neither fair nor what I was willing to pay and after an hour of waiting for them to work on it I was told they couldn't do anything, so we started to leave. The sales person was waving us down through the windows and said his price guy was apparently ""joking"". That was already annoying but we agreed to go in because we were PROMISED they'd hit the price we wanted.

Another hour or so later as the dealership was closing and we were already agitated with the amount of time it took them, we got to talk to the rude finance manager who basically lied to us go get us to sign. He tried making it sound like we're getting extra stuff that made up for the difference when we were told they were in fact (AFTER HOURS) not able to hit the price we were promised. So tired and being constantly pressured about it, we regretfully signed

I also wish they were more transparent about the credit check process, because they ran it through a bank I absolutely refuse to do business with and didn't approve it anyways, putting an unnecessary hit on my credit, as well as another hit for no reason because they didn't tell me to watch out for calls from banks and I apparently hung up on one of them running my credit because they wouldn't say who they were and I had another call.

I have no real issue with the sales person we dealed with, but rather the finance people and dealership.",1.0
2,"July 27, 2019","I went to Honda for my first oil change, and was greeted by Ryan Hall. After talking with him a few minutes he instructed me that it would be 45 minute wait, and it was exactly 45 minutes. Keep up the great work guys!",5.0
3,"February 27, 2019","Simply stated, the sales process and the prices are exceptional.  I just purchased my second vehicle from Honda of Lake Jackson.  As with the previous purchase, the interaction was very personalized, the car buying process was swift, and the pricing was competitive both locally and nationally.  Just as important, the sales representative (David Woodley) went to great lengths to ensure that I had the best pricing and financing possible. Because of my positive experiences, I have enthusiastically recommended this dealership and my sales representative, David Woodley, to each of my business partners.",5.0

10,"December 12, 2018","Honda Service Department always gets my car in and out of service in timely manner. They make suggestions as to what needs to or should be done soon to keep my car in tip top shape. They are never pushy about getting it done right now, unless it’s something that could be a danger to me while driving. They are always very friendly and the dealership is always clean.

12,"December 10, 2018","The Service Writer, Amber, was able to make my oil change appointment quickly. Before I arrived, Amber did thorough in review of my 2014 Accord service history, and already knew what I expected. The service tech found a week battery. Amber told me it was covered under the battery manufacturers warranty, and I authorized the replacement. I have complete confidence in Honda of Lake Jackson service department. ",5.0
13,"December 05, 2018","I would like to start by saying that the service that I received from this dealership on Dec. 4, 2018, was one of the worst customer service experiences that I have ever received in my life.  On Dec 3rd, I viewed a vehicle that was posted by the dealership and contacted them to verify that the vehicle was still available for sale.  I was greeted by Mr. James ***** and I was informed that the vehicle was available and I was told that he would have someone text more pictures of the vehicle to me.  I received the pictures and I was told that the price of the vehicle was as such because of the paint condition on the vehicle.  Communication continued through Mr. James *****  as to if I was still interested in the vehicle after receiving the pictures.  I acknowledge that I was still interested in the vehicle and that I would be by Dec. 4 that afternoon to see it.  This is because the dealership is two and a half hours away from where I live. 
My wife, seven-month-old daughter and myself, arrive at Honda of Lake Jackson and was greeted by a salesperson and informed that Mr. James ***** was not there today.  The salesperson did say he was told that Mr. James ***** was expecting some customers today and that he would help us in his place.   We told him why we were there and was escorted to his desk so that he could get more information on the vehicle and the keys.  When the gentlemen returned he started by saying ""I hate to be the one to bring bad news but that vehicle was taken to the shop"".  I then informed the salesperson that we drove two and a half hours to see this vehicle after communicating with Mr. James ***** that we would be there at this time the day before.  The salesperson then goes and talk to the ""Sales Manager to discuss the situation we have now been put in and was told that there is a comparable vehicle outside that we can see.  Reluctantly but for my wife to get an idea of what to expect I entertained the request and we did. After viewing the vehicle I identified the difference between the two vehicles to my wife and the salesperson questioned my interest in that vehicle over the one we viewed.  I stated that the price was the sole reason and he replies by asking if I had seen the vehicle that we came to purchase.   I inform him of the communication between myself and Mr. James ***** and that I had received pictures of the vehicle.  At this point, it is when his face revealed some concern as he states that the vehicle is in the shop to be painted.  I told him that was not possible and presented the exchange of text between Mr. James ******* and myself addressing the price because of the paint. After more discussion between him and his Sales Manager my wife, my seven-month-old and myself was informed the vehicle is being painted and the price will reflect the paintwork.  Let me state again after communicating with this dealership all day Monday, Dec. 4, 2018, letting them know that we are coming out on a two and a half hour drive to see this vehicle this what we are told.  I go on to reiterate that I have just driven my family two and a half hour can we at least see the vehicle.  the salesperson went yet again to the ""Sales Manager"" and was told no we could not and not only could we not but they have nothing to offer us.  
At this point, I was informed that the only thing they can offer me is a 3-year lease on a new vehicle for $13,000.  I expressed that I was not there to lease a vehicle, if my intention was to lease I could have saved again my wife, my seven-month-old and myself two and a half hour or 5 hours all together and leased from the Honda dealership 5 miles away from us. As we are leaving the dealership with nothing, after I have lost time and money I do address the salesperson and tell him that this is the worst service that I have ever received in my life.  I was disgusted that the so-called ""Sales Manager"" never stepped outside of their office but sat there looking at me through their glass window. For one as a manager, I would have never allowed ony of my team members to face this issue alone.  Secondly, the way that the ""Sales Management"" team sat there looking at us; as if our sale did not matter to their business, as they made no effort to even compensate us for the wasted time and money that we have lost. 
Of course, as we are leaving the dealership I call Mr. James ***** and my call goes directly to voicemail, where his voice mail is full.  I then send him a text expressing my feeling with their service and how my and my families time was wasted traveling to view a vehicle that was not available.  As of today, I have not heard from Mr. James ***** or anyone from the dealership regarding this issue; not even an apology for wasting and inconveniencing my family and I.

14,"December 04, 2018","Today I drove to the dealership from Pasadena (over an hour drive) to see 2 vehicles they supposedly had for sale. I wouldnt have driven if I wasnt serious about the possible purchase, and I had spoken with a lady lastbight about me going, then thry called again when I was 10 mins away and told them i was almost there. When I arrived they couldnt find my name, then to makes matters worse they said the Honda Pilot I was to see was not there and was in Angleton (Frustrating 🤦🏻???) so I asked for The second vehicle i was to see, and that one they said was no longer for sale because it had “issues” I was going to just leave but they had brought up another pilot so husband and I decided to take a look, AND LOVED IT... we were going to purchase it, but when they were going to start on all the paper work, the guy helping us said there was a problem 🙄 that it had already been sold to someone else but he didnt know 🤦🏻??? We had driven it around test driving it and all, like really??? He then tries suggesting to lease 😁... we left very dissapointed, wasted all our morning there 😡😡😡😡",1.0
15,"November 29, 2018","We recently bought a new Honda Civic from the Lake Jackson Dealership. When completing our paperwork we were told we get free oil changes for a year at every 5000 miles. Today I called to make my first appointment for my first free oil change. The employee asked me if this was my first of two free oil changes. I told her it is my first free oil change, but we get ours for an entire year. The employee told me the free oil changes for a year consist of two oil changes and tire rotations. Are you minding me?????? The employee even told me she doesn’t know why they tell people they get free oil changes for a year. Unreal!!! Free oil changes for a year consist of two for the entire year. I will never buy another vehicle from Honda of Lake Jackson. They are not honest and it’s truly a let down. ",1.0

71,"April 17, 2018","David Woodley at Honda of Lake Jackson was a very nice, kind salesman who assisted me through my purchase of my 2018 Honda Pilot.  He and the dealership came up with a fair trade for my 2016 Honda Pilot as well as fantastic financing of 0.9% for 60 months through American Honda Finance Company. I decided to upgrade with the 2018 getting leather seats and a sunroof.  This one gets about 4 miles per gallon better on gas mileage than the 2016. It also has some neat safety features such as stopping the vehicle if it knows you are going to run into the car in front of you.  The cruise control is set so that it will slowly decrease for the car in front of you to continue to keep a safe distance and then speed back up once that is no longer a problem.  My family and I immediately left on vacation the next day after purchase heading to South Carolina.  I allowed my 16 year grandson to drive it and I was amazed how he set the cruise control at 2 miles over the speed limit and really was a very safe driver.  It was a great experience for him getting to drive in six different states.  Yesterday I brought my Honda back in to have the interior protection done.  They also washed the exterior.  David also put on my license plates and sticker.  The service is superior at Honda of Lake Jackson and I highly recommend them if you are looking for a reliable, sporty vehicle to drive. Rod Hall is a great owner and knew that I liked Navy Blue which was available with all the neat stuff on it. Rod is also a great supporter of our community.  He is very active in the Brazosport Rotary Club where he is a past president and headed up the Shrimp Boil twice.  He is also on the Brazosport College Foundation has a Board Member and has supported Brazosport College by donating toward the Strive to Drive 2018 Honda Civic.  I sincerely appreciate his support of our community.

Definitely helped us put all our fears of buying a new car aside and gave us the confidence we needed to actually commit and purchase a new car. He mentioned he was new but we would have never guessed with all his knowledge of the vehicles and financing information. I highly recommend buying from Honda but even more so I recommend taking your journey of finding and buying the right car with mr. David bronikowsky! He made our experience the best it could of possibly been. We probably would have never gone through with our purchase without him taking the time to educate us and explain every little detail!,5.0
85,"February 20, 2018","They have a used 2016 Nissan Murano Platinum that was advertised on their website and others at a price that was at the low range per NADA and KBB.  The dealer's description says ""PRICED TO SELL QUICKLY! Research suggests it will not be available for long. *Low Miles*...Honda of Lake Jackson prides itself on value pricing its vehicles and exceeding all customer expectations!...""  I drove over 100 miles to test drive this vehicle.  The salesman was nice and we took the vehicle for a test drive.  He then suggested I take a look at a new Honda CRV, so I let him show me a couple of new cars, but did not test drive either one.  I asked him to draw up the paperwork on the Nissan with my car as a trade-in.  I was shocked when he presented me with a price for the Nissan that was $4,445 more than their advertised price....and that was before any of the other fees and taxes were added in!!  I asked him to explain why the price was more than the advertised price and he asked me to show him the advertisement.  I went out to my car and brought back the printed advertisement that had been printed from another website.  He took it to his sales manager who then came to tell me that he wasn't aware that the car was being advertised on the internet for that low price and implied that the website I used to print out the advertisement was at fault.  He said he couldn't sell it to me for that price.  I told him that his dealership website had the same vehicle listed at that same price and he verified that he had checked his website before talking to me and confirmed that I was correct.  His dealership's website had posted this car for sale at the same advertised price as what was printed on the paper I brought with me.  He flatly refused to honor his own advertised price and tried to redirect the blame on another company when in fact the advertised price originates with his dealership.  The other websites pull their information from his website.  He knows how this works, and so do I.  His explanation was disingenuous.  This is poor business practice.  ",1.0

This dealership helped me get this car to Houston for I was single and did not have anyone to drive me down there so they delivered it for me to my work.  I signed the papers then and when they were putting the papers together on the Financial side he called me and walked me through what I was paying for.  They brought the papers, I signed them and gave them my down payment and now I have a new car to me which I drove home last night and found out I have to find out how to work some of the things in that car, but have not had time yet.

106,"September 06, 2017","I've always brought my car to this dealership for Maintenance and shopped here for parts, but the last couple years I have not been given the attention that I once was.  I use to bring my car here and when they recommended work be done while they were already ""in there"" I would say go ahead and do it, not any more. My last couple experiences have not been that well and prices for parts has been much higher than MSRP. 

I recently brought my car in for some A/C trouble which turned out to be a $12  relay, and a ""possible"" leak in the system, or so i was told. They attempted to charge me well over retail for the part $40+ and then I was told they would put dye in my system to find the leak. I drove around with a hot car for a few weeks till I needed to go on a road trip. I went to the store and bought a can of refrigerant  (no sealers, no hybrids etc, just plain refrigerant) and charged my system myself in less than 15 minutes. My A/C has been running fine ever since. My total bill for them to plug in a relay was over $250 and would have been over $300 if I hadn't complained about the ridiculous price of the relay. 

Every time I try to buy parts from them they attempt to charge above MSRP for the part. I can look up MSRP on line. The last time I called for a price on an Alternator. I asked for a price on a NEW Alternator and was quoted over $400 for a Re-manufactured one. (I was offered a 15% discount, but that still only brought it down the price I could buy a NEW alternator for online. 

When I asked for the price of a new one the 2nd time he just laughed and said it would be around $800!  MSRP for a NEW OEM Alternator is $507.23, and they can be found much cheaper than that online. So I did.  

Also the salesman was a bit distracted while I was on the phone. I would have rather been placed on hold and waited till I could get some undivided attention. I'm done here. ",1.4

These people are rude, incompetent, and unprofessional. I have reported the sales manager, Thomas Kercik, to Honda headquarters. 
So far, we have had 5 months of their ignoring our needs to license THEIR leased vehicle out of state. They were well aware that I live out of state when I signed the lease. The person in the licensing department, Laura Pontius, never returned one of my numerous phone calls about the licensing.  I had to do all of the research with the Texas licensing department myself.
In addition,  I have signed four different lease contracts because of their mistakes, again because they had to figure out how to manage an out of state lease.  As proof of their incompetence, they paid my first month's lease payment and the extra taxes they had not been aware of.
Thomas Kercik accused my son of lying and stressed that the licensing problems were ""your [my] fault."" Steer clear of Honda of Lake Jackson!",1.0
116,"March 11, 2016",Excellent experience from start to finish.  Jim & Thomas were very helpful without being pushy - answered all our questions & got us a great price! Went the extra mile on delivery of our vehicle - making sure we were familiar with all its features. ,5.0

118,"January 27, 2016","On 1-26-16, I saw a Used Toyota Tundra online that I wanted to test drive and possibly purchase at Honda of Lake Jackson. I emailed Rod Hall (manager/operating partner) to let him know of my interest and he notified me that Mike Chrisman, General Sales Manager, would contact me and assist me with my inquiry.  Mike called me and invited me in to see the Toyota. I made the decision after work, at 5pm to drive from Channelview to Lake Jackson to see the vehicle.  Upon arrival, I saw and fell in love with the Tundra.  I went inside and introduced myself to Mike. A young lady named Crystal also greeted me and was overly friendly, helpful, and personable.  Crystal agreed to ride with my husband and me on a test drive of the Tundra.  After the test drive, I quickly realized that although I wanted a truck, I knew that this ride was just not feasible with my daily 40 mile commute and it would quickly consume a lot of gas (since it was lifted).  While sitting on the showroom floor, weighing in on my wants vs. my needs, my husband walked around the showroom playing in the various vehicles and he immediately fell in love with the new 2016 Honda Civic.  He asked me to sit in the driver’s seat to see how it felt and it was so sporty! I quickly fell in love. In the end, I made the decision to purchase this sporty little car 1) because of the great gas mileage and 2) because of the sportiness of the new model. I must say, I am beyond pleased with my purchase. I am also pleased with the entire buying process from all individuals involved:  Mike Chrisman, Crystal Acevedo, Charles Moore, and Thomas Krsak were not only polite, but they were patient, and not at all pushy with the typical “sales pitch”.  They allowed me the time to weigh my options and in the end, they gave me exactly what I wanted from the interest rate to the amount I wanted for my trade-in (and they even threw in a free Igloo Sportsman cooler to make the hubby happy)! They stayed late, almost an hour after they closed just so that I could leave that night with the car.  Kuddos to Rod Hall and the entire team at Honda of Lake Jackson for being “down to earth” people with great personalities that know how to make the buying process stress free. I definitely recommend this dealership!",5.0
119,"January 25, 2016","I had a wonderful experience here. From the moment I walked onto the lot, to when I signed the final paper, the whole experience was absolutely painless. I started looking on a Friday night, went on a test drive with Jeff, and was very impressed with the car that I drove (a 2013 Honda Accord) Jeff was very knowledgeable about the vehicle we were in and answered all of my questions. He was even very understanding when I told him I wanted to think about it and would let him know.I even met the General Manager, Mike and he was extremely nice and attentive. The next day I found out that the car I had test drove the night before was sold that morning. When I came back by the dealership Jeff and Mike were already prepared with options to show me in place of the other car. They showed me a 2012 Honda Accord and we test drove it and I was sold. 
This was my first time buying a car and the whole experience was awesome. The whole team on Saturday night went above and beyond to make sure that I was happy and satisfied with my choice. Jeff, Mike and even Charles in Financing stayed an hour after they closed so we could get most of the paperwork taken care of.

131,"April 04, 2014"," My wife and I researched vehicles and shopped online prior to me visiting your dealership on Friday, March 21, 2014 to look at a CR-V.  We planned to visit the dealership on Saturday to test drive and possible purchase this vehicle.  I received a call that evening at approximately 7 P.M. from ""Customer Service"" and I gave them the requested info.  They called my wife approximately 1 hour later and requested the same info.  She explained that we had already given them the info but the lady became very rude to my wife insisting that we set an appointment time for the next day.  She even received another call from the same number while she was already on the line.  They even called again while my wife was still on the original call.  I called the dealership after this call (A total of 5 calls that evening from ""Customer Service"") and talked to Cory.  He was very nice and told me to ask for him when we came in.

We were very satisfied with both Daniel and Cory and agreed to purchase the vehicle.  All went well until my wife went into finance (while I took our trade home to unload it).  When I called her to let her know that I was on my way back, she told me that the finance manager was trying to sell her a protection package and that she was not comfortable with it at all.  I told her not to sign or agree to anything until I got there.  After he gave us his sales pitch I repeatedly told him no but he wouldn't take no for an answer.  We finally agreed to 1 of the three packages offered for $3 a month (5 year protection plan on a 3 year lease) for a total of approx. $105.  I can't believe that a dealership would tolerate this high pressure tactic for something the customer did not want and that the dealership made so little profit from.

During the whole process of negotiating and finally agreeing to the deal, I made it clear that I wanted both the "" Monroney"" sticker and the Addendum sticker.  I was told that it was out of the dealership being laminated.  I have been back twice since then and have still not received them as requested.  As you are aware, it is a violation of both State and Federal law for the vehicle to be sold without them in the first place.  My wife and I are both not satisfied with the fact that the stickers were missing; the actual MSRP was never quoted are written down during or after our dealings and with the mistake made by finance concerning the $750 rebate.  He actually called and went to my wife's office in Angleton and changed the contract.  When she questioned him about the change he never told her what was changed only that the payment would not change.

Regardless if the deal was a ""fair"" deal or not, the way it was presented left a doubt in both of our minds.

After a lot of talk with her and Rod I settled on the EX-L I4/CVT instead.  It's a great car and this was by for the best experience I have ever had buying a vehicle.  Nichole was very knowledgeable  about the vehicle and provided outstanding customer service. She was really great with keeping my daughter and her friend entertained during this whole time also.

143,"November 23, 2013","I personally hate purchasing vehicles, because it's ALWAYS a big pain.   It's very stressful and I hate the games.   I fully expected this going into this transaction, and probably had kind of a protective shell on when I went in for this reason.   I was vigilant and looking for any misrepresentation.   


Thanks to the staff at Honda of Lake Jackson, my fears were completely unfounded.   


1.) Nichole was very personable and easy going.   There was no hard sell, and I felt like she respected my opinion and listened to what I was saying.   She demonstrated that she cared about getting me into the car that I wanted and not just trying to move merchandise.    

2.) Cory was upfront and honest.  Although I did give him a bit of a hard time, I feel like he gave me a good deal up front with little hassle.   

3.) Thomas was patient as I tried to read all of the small print and didn't try to rush me.  He explained all of the documents to me and I believe he was honest and upfront with what my expectations should be.  

4.) Mike in the service department explained to me up front what was going to be done on the car (my requested additions) and when I got it back he explained it to me again.  He even took an extended time to try to show me how to use the remote start (because that thing is pretty confusing).   

Also:  Rod came up and introduced himself and spent quite a bit of time talking to me.   You don't really see that EVER.   It's evident that he's passionate about the business and loves what he does.   This is not just a revenue generating machine for him.   He truly cares about the success of the dealership.   

Usually after making a major purchase like a car, I have several days of sinking feelings afterward wondering if I was ripped off, or if I overlooked something in the paperwork that will come back to haunt me later.   

This is the FIRST TIME in my life that I actually feel like I got everything I wanted in a new car purchase, and I was treated with respect and dignity.   I hope everyone involved knows that I really appreciated their efforts.

144,"May 16, 2013","Went looking for a pre-owned vehicle and the salesman who I assume loss the toss, had to come out and talk to us. He never introduced himself. He was only concerned with how much $$ we wanted to spend and whether or not the vehicle would be financed. When asked for prices of the different vehicles (No prices shown on vehicles) He only wanted to know which one we were interested in. Did not give us any prices. Said they were all on line if I wanted to see them. Will NEVER step back on their lot... Thanks to this guy being so rude, we went elsewhere and purchased a Toyota Rav4...",2.0
145,"March 30, 2013","After visiting two other Honda dealerships and having BAD experiences with them we when back to Lake Jackson where our experience was unlike we have ever experienced before. Victor was very knowledgable about the car we were interested in, the Honda Accord.  There wasn't a bell or whistle he didn't mention.  He went over the car from front to back.  When we showed up at his dealership after dealing with the Houston dealerships, he made us feel very relaxed listened to what we wanted, financial wise and got to work.  He came back with his first offer which was about $50 higher of a car not then we wanted ( so we were in the ballpark) but we hadn't told him the down payment we wanted to be down
He computed those numbers and we ended up being $17 less a month than we had wanted.  We pulled into the dealership around 7 pm we had paperwork done, signed and sealed by 830.  No hassle and none go the let me talk to my manager wo brings in his manager and so on.  Very good experience and I kept my money local which is important to me as well.

148,"January 03, 2013","  Major ""KUDOS"" to the great sales department of Honda of Lake Jackson.  My fiance' and I spent over a year looking and pricing vehicles. As with anyone, just trying to find the best deal. I contacted Thomas on several occasions and bugged him to death trying to find a car that simply wasn't to be found. Even through my frustrations he never lost his cool. 
  Finally, on the 26th of December the Accord we wanted was available and we could not have been happier with our choice. The floor saleman, Victor Gutierrez, was awesome to deal with as well. Very thorough, not pushy, and realized quickly that I knew what I wanted and did whatever it took to make it happen. If I have the opportunity to work with these two gentlemen in the future ""I WILL NOT HESITATE""! They, along with the over-all ""atmosphere"" and serenity of the entire dealership was STELLAR! 
    The quality of their cars?  Well..........it's still Honda and its ""priceless"". Our choice was the loaded 2013 Accord Sedan with a few ""bells and whistles"" added for a personal touch! I am totally amazed at what they have done to this automobile. My first Accord was in 1998.  It was awesome then, but ""nothing like today's models""!  WOW!!!!  I will do it again one day. To Victor and Thomas, "" my personal thanks for a very smooth and stress-free deal. You two scored BIG!

You made me feeel that my 25yrs of owining Hondas I am part of the family. Robert, Rod you moved mountains for me. This was the best birthday present that I could buy myself.  

Thank you so much for answering all of my questions honestly, and making the wait well worth it and not as painful as it otherwise could have been. I'm happy with the car I purchased, and I'm not freaking out about the purchase price. That's a pretty ideal situation when it comes to buying a new car, and it's all thanks to you.
