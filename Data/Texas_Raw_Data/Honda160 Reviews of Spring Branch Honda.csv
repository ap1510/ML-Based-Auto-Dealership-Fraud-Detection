30,"April 12, 2019","I'm at the dealership now and have never written a review before but I just couldn't let this one go. My car was totalled so I'm definitely buying a car, with cash, and the salesmen were just awful. The salesman that first greeted me listened to what I was looking for had a car pulled up front then handed me off to another salesman without my knowledge.  He didn't introduce us or excuse himself he just disappeared. The feeling I got from the second salesman was that it was a pain to show me the different models and explain the different features. I think I actually like the Honda models a bit better than the Toyota however because of the salesmen and lack of willingness to please I think Toyota will be my choice. I can just imagine what the service department would be like here!!",2.0

34,"March 13, 2018","We've been a customer of Spring Branch Honda for about 20 years.     99.99% of the time, everything is smooth.     Recently we had an on-going problem with a tire.    Neither Discount or NTB could find the problem, and Spring Branch just kept filling up the tire with air every month or so.   Spoke with Mr. Ali Bharwani about the issue and he was very understanding and told me to bring the vehicle in the next morning.     They found a pinhole size leak in the tread.    Fixed the issue, refilled all the tires with nitrogen and provided courtesy transportation to and from work.     Did I mention they didn't charge us for the non-warranty work?     Now that's customer service.     So in the long run they will benefit from our loyalty, but I wanted to share that this dealership and service manager really do care about their customers.     Many thanks. ",5.0
35,"November 23, 2017"," I purchased a vehicle there three weeks ago. The service I received was top notch. It started with the sales man Shady Yauhari, provide me with the best service that I ever received from a dealership. With the  assistance  of  Kevin and Cotten they worked out a  deal that work for me. The signing of the documents I could say was a great experience also Edgar Williford   The overall service that I received from Spring branch was top-notch .",5.0
36,"October 21, 2017","Complete waste of time!!!!!!  On the morning of 10/19/17, I scheduled an appointment on line for a state inspection for the following morning.  Within 30 minutes, I received a confirmation email (Confirmation Code X04K0EB438) for my scheduled state inspection.  On the following morning, I take a day off from work and show up for my scheduled appointment.  After being greeted by the service advisor, she proceeds to tell me the state inspection machine has been broken for over a week.  When I voice my displeasure at not having been contacted, she states that it is the call centers fault.  After getting nothing but excuses from the service advisor, I ask to speak with the service manager.  He finally comes out and apologizes but again claims it is not their fault because they are unable to block options that are not available when scheduling appointments on line.  I asked why they can’t simply contact customers since they have all of the contact information.  He says that is a good idea and that he will bring that up in their next meeting.  Here is another suggestion for Rick Bear, the service manager, maybe Spring Branch Honda needs a new service manager who understand what customer service is!   ",1.0

39,"March 22, 2017","I went to 3 Honda dealerships in Houston to buy my new Honda Accord touring version.  

After visiting all 3 dealers, I chose to buy from Spring Branch Honda.

Why?
1.  Everyone (sales and management) seemed to want my business
2. My sales person (Daniel) worked hard to get me to buy a car
3. Their first price was fair - sure I got it down more but it was a good starting point
4. The management team emailed me and thanked me for visiting
I now have most of the management team's names, emails and phone numbers if I have a problem in the future
5. Their finance department was quick, efficient and explained things clearly.

So shop around - visit at least 3 dealerships. Then you will notice a big difference in the dealerships. Everyone here is smiling and happy. They seem to love their jobs. 

They will make you feel like you are their #1 customer.

40,"December 23, 2016","Do NOT purchase your vehicle at Spring Branch Honda. In hopes of finding the perfect car upon college graduation, my father went to Spring Branch Honda to fulfill this mission. We were looking for a 2017 Honda CR-V which we had previously seen in Honda of Katy but were trying to get at a better price. The sales person which assisted my father, Calvin Tran, deceived my father into thinking he was getting a great deal. The vehicle report (papers that are shown on the dashboard of the vehicle) Calvin initially showed my father stated the vehicle was worth ~ $36,000. My father negotiated $33,000 and Calvin came back with a counteroffer of ~$33,250. Thinking this was a great deal my father took it immediately. 

Coming back home and reviewing all the paperwork, we saw the actual vehicle report that belonged to the Honda CR-V. We saw the Honda was actually valued at $33,295. At first, we thought this was the incorrect paperwork, however we checked the VIN number of the vehicle and it matched the vehicle report. The so called “deal” was only $45 dollars off. 

It was VERY humiliating and upsetting for my father to realize he had been tricked that way. Honesty is extremely important in any situation, especially when making such a big purchase. The next morning, my father went to Spring Branch Honda to complain about what he had just found out. He tried to confront the sales person about what he did to him but the staff lied about him not being at work. One of the managers tried to help my father and apologized profusely about the situation. He even gave him his word that he would deduct $2,000 from the deal because of what happened. He mentioned that he was not the Senior Manager thus the deal had to be made the following day. Less than three hours later, the manager called me telling me the deal did not go through. He did not even have the courtesy to talk to my father first who was the one he made the deal with. 

Long Story Short, Do NOT buy your vehicle here. The dealership does NOT care about the customers and will do whatever they can to scam you. If you want honest people and great customer service, go elsewhere.

41,"November 24, 2016","On Nov 15, 2016, I was catered by Mr. Bhavik Patel from Honda CRV Service for my first motor oil change @ 5K miles.  Since I already purchase oil change package, I did not worry about the details.  Everything is taken care of and the task is completed without any hassle.  I was also offered shuttle service back to my home while the car was being service at the station and was later picked up on time when the car was ready.  Excellent service was catered to me and I appreciate that.",5.0

43,"August 29, 2016","I purchased a HRV from this dealership a month ago. Today I received a phone call from the internet directer (I did not purchase my vehicle online), Juan Perez, accusing me of STEALING the vehicle. I financed through my Credit Union and left all my information with the finance. They lost my information and instead of asking for it again they threatened me with the police! The dealership never sent my bank the purchase order so they could not submit a payment. I am deeply offended and upset! DO NOT BUY HERE!",1.0
44,"May 03, 2016","I had oil change service on my Honda Civic last weekend. I have always gotten my cars serviced at dealerships, either Russel and Smith or Spring Branch. 

During the service the employee ""Solomon"" comes and asked me if I had liked to get my transmission fluid and brake oil replaced as it looked very bad upon inspection according to him. This was the same thing that they told me six months ago. I asked him how often should I get this thing done. He told me that the transmission fluid should be changed once every ""30000"" miles and the brake fluid should be replaced once every ""three"" years. I asked him to go ahead with it.

About 20 months and 15000 miles ago, I had the same work done at Russel and Smith Honda. Within a year these guys were asking me to get the same stuff changed, since they didn't had the knowledge that I got it done already at Russell and Smith Honda. 

Once the service got done, I showed the document/receipt from Russel and Smith for comparison and he was suddenly apologizing. 

I trust them with my car and they gave me false information on the services needed.",1.8

46,"March 15, 2016","I moved here from Dallas, TX and Spring Branch Honda is close to my home. I must say that the service reps treated me with respect and dignity. Wayne McCuan has been a ""SAINT"" each time I've taken my 2014 Honda Accord to Spring Branch for service.

48,"November 04, 2015","I use to be a car salesman. Having to be on the otherside of the table was hard. I went to several dealerships and found sales man that just wanted to Sale you the car they want t not what you want. So much pressure was put on me.that was at Katy Honda. Then I went over to Gillmn Honda I was looking for a 2015 Honda Accord. The salesman gave me an offer at full sticker price and then to add insult they offered me next to nothing for m trade.

Gillman Honda sucks and Katy Honda sucks. 

Go as for Carlos Garcia at Spring Branch Honda he is the best!!!",5.0
49,"November 03, 2015","I recently bought a new Honda Civic LX and realized after a day or two that I was uncomfortable with the color.  I requested to exchange the car for a different color and the dealership agreed, something they were in no way obligated to do.  They followed up after purchase with a survey to help improve their service.  I also receive a great price for the car.  Much obliged to them.

50,"October 11, 2015","Got great service at spring branch honda on my recent visit for an oil change and tire rotation. The wait was shorter than what was promised. Yeah. Maria was my service advisor this time and she was amazing. Very prompt, knowledgable and kept me in the loop on how the service was going. I used to get Pat but she is now retired. Erik, who I often get as my service advisor is fantastic too. Always does a great job. Did I mention I have had Honda's for 28 years. My pilot runs great. No issues and I just love the ride. I tried.the jeeps but there is nothing like a Honda. And Roxanna the cashier was amazing. So friendly.",5.0
51,"August 06, 2015","I recently bought an Accord 2015. No mechanical issues thankfully, but was, and still am having issues with my windows. When on the highway you can hear the air coming through and its the most annoying thing ever. Anyway, a week I later took my car in and had to leave it there for the day. I picked it up the next day and still heard the whistling sound, a couple of days later I noticed that the seals running vertically down the doors were lose! When driven on the highway it fans out as if its about to take off. Not just on the driver side, but both driver and passenger. I called the guy who was AND STILL IS working on my car (Wayne) no answer TWICE, left voicemails, NO returned call. I was finally able to get a hold of him and it turns out one ONE part was ordered when I specifically told him both driver and passenger sides were lose. Apart from not returning my calls he had an attitude when he finally got on the phone after he was in the background telling another guy what to say to me. Honestly, it really pisses me off that I cant get one SIMPLE thing fixed and done RIGHT the first time and for Wayne to not return my calls when I call to ask about my parts. I make my car payments on time Honda, I expect the same type of service from you. ",2.4
52,"July 27, 2015","I was considering between CRV and Fit at the beginning of the year when my beloved Odyssey died.  Was recommended Honda Fit which I've been having issues with and can see why the dealership was eager to push the sale.  After $25k spent on this tiny car and 6 month later, several things did not live up to expectations:
1. The under car splash guard fell off within first 30 days.  I took it back to the dealership and the service  personnel said it's not covered under warranty.  Hello?  I just bought the car??  Had to speak to the manager for them to fix it.
2. Tried to take my car in for its first oil change 3 times.  No matter what time of the day I get there, was told the wait is 3-5 hours.  Seriously?  Drove down to Gillman Honda by my mom's and got it done in 45 minutes.
3. TPMS light comes on after driving for 100 miles or so (out of town trip).  Stopped by Discount Tires (highly loved!) for a complete tires inspection only to find there's nothing wrong.  It was good news that there's nothing wrong but getting tired of stopping on a road trip for bogus issue.
4. Called Spring Branch Honda to schedule a service appointment to check out TPMS light.  On hold for 17 minutes, spoke to a real person for 45 seconds, was told the first available appointment is Aug 6 (today is July 27) and the reason being national airbag recall.  Ridiculous!  Increase the staff or something.  What good is warranty for when you can't get your car fixed in a timely manner?

Would recommend to stay away from Spring Branch Honda.  Used to live closer to Gillman Honda and people over there are much better!!!",1.0
53,"June 10, 2015","The guy at Spring Branch is very rude. He thinks he is always right. I think he represents the way the service industry is going in the US. The moto used to be "" the customer is right"" but people like Lassine believe they can sell their crappy product and never expect any complaints for service and product. Don't go to spring branch or Honda cars of Katy. They are both filled with rude representatives. I have taken my third Honda on lease but now I am done.",1.3
54,"June 01, 2015","I went in with a pre-approval letter from my bank for a auto loan and they insisted on using in house financing which was giving me a higher interest rate than my bank plus a down payment requirement which my bank was not asking for. The finance individuals were very condescending, patronizing and dishonest. They told us they had contacted our bank and that they were the ones asking for the down payment and higher interest rate. Yet when I called my bank on speaker phone they outlined the terms of my loan plus stated no one had called them from the dealership regarding my loan. Very dishonest and untrustworthy. ",1.0

57,"July 31, 2014","I went into spring branch honda super excited to purchase a new car. I was so ready, I saved up a ton of money, did my research and headed into the dealer. When I got there I was baited into thinking I was going to get a good price by being quoted 20k for a new civic si I was looking to purchase. After we sat down at the table to talk numbers that 20k went to 25k after all the tacked on xxxxxxxx they tried to charge me with. To try to get the price down I then suggested my trade in. They offered me 5000 for a car that's well worth x2 that amount. After I questioned that amount he offered to show me "" all the Knicks and scratches "" that allowed him to make such decision. At that point I was furious and mostly insulted. He must have thought I was an absolute idiot. Regardless, I sat an talked numbers. After everything was said and done he tried to overall make me 41k for a 2014 honda civic si. I've never felt so insulted in my entire life.and no, it wasn't because of bad credit, it was just because he was trying to make a buck off me. Not only did this turn me bitter to dealerships, but if turned me bitter to honda. I absolutely love Honda vehicles, but have started searching else where.",1.2

60,"September 17, 2013","My wife and I purchased a new 2013 Honda Fit.     I had shopped for the best e-price from a few dealers.      My first visit was to another Honda dealer, but that ended in their attempt to jack-up the price with add-ons, and I left.      Spring Branch Honda was able to match their price, and did not charge any extra for window tint that was already on the car.      Spring Branch Honda ended up being the best price in Houston.     They did not have the color we wanted, and the Sales Manager even drove it across town to make sure it arrived safely.      The car was in immaculate detailed condition and ready for us to test drive at the time set.     Paperwork was handled quickly in Finance, and they didn't push for the extended warranty, just let us know it was available.      I also had a vehicle to trade, and they also gave the best price on that even beating out Carmax.

If you want a painless experience, excellent pricing, professional treatment and no hassles.........    buy your next car from Spring Branch Honda.      We are 100% satisfied.",5.0
61,"August 16, 2013","My wife and I were in the market for a new CRV. She wanted the specific color ""Mountain Air Metallic"". I contacted 3 other dealerships prior to choosing Spring Branch Honda. 2 dealerships flat out said they couldn't get that color- ""what is your second color choice"" was their response. Bye bye 2 dealerships...the 3rd one could get it but a little later than Spring Branch. Funny, the 3rd one is the ""sister"" to Spring Branch. Hmmm I'm starting to see a trend here. I contacted Mike Flatt in the Internet dept at Spring Branch. He informed me they could get it and would arrive around the14th of August 2013. We went in to do the deal, and also met his boss Robert Doolittle. These are 2 of the finest men at a car dealership I have ever met. My wife and I were both very impressed with them. They went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of now and in the immediate future. We do not buy cars often, but this is by far the best experience we have EVER had. You will not go wrong buying your next Honda here! ",5.0
62,"August 16, 2013","In today's tough economic times one wants a dependable vehicle at a great price.  One doesn't want just ""A-"" but ""A+"".  This is what I found with my New 2013 Honda Civic LX at Spring Branch Honda with Robert Doolittle.  I knew that the Honda Civic was dependable.  My last vehicle was a Civic that I purchased from Spring Branch (then Goodson Honda) and I had the car for over 9 years.  This was the longest I have ever owned a car.

The styling of my 2013 Civic is beautiful.  I got the Red Crimson Pearl with Black/Tan interior.  We got window tint, which I highly recommend as it cuts down on the glare.  We also got a cargo tray protecting the trunk area.  The 2013 Honda Civic LX is Loaded with Standard Features.  I especially like the Bluetooth Hands Free feature and the Backup Camera, helping you to see what you might not be able to otherwise.  The instrumentation is awesome.  It has all the information that you will ever need arranged where you can easily read it.  And it handles like a dream. With the new suspension that Honda put in this car it is very responsive making it very ""Fun to Drive"".

This car is not only ""Fun to Drive""  but it is ""Easy on the Pocketbook"".  I found that in city driving I get between 31-32 MPG.  My wife and I just got back form our trip from Houston to Vinton, Louisiana and, using the Econ Button on the Honda Civic, we got 47.5 MPG.  Not bad for a vehicle that is Not a Hybrid.

So what about price?  I was able to go to Spring Branch Honda with the price that I wanted to pay and Robert Doolittle agreed to that price.  Simple, isn't it?  No arguing, no having to check with the sales manager 3 or 4 times.  Just wanting a Dependable Vehicle at a Great Price and Getting it!!  So if you're in the market for a new car that is stylish, plenty of standard features, fun to drive, and great gas mileage stop in to Spring Branch Honda and see Robert Doolittle.

63,"June 30, 2013","Abraham was one of the few no-nonsense dealers I dealt with in the Houston area when trying to purchase a new 2013 Honda Accord. I called him up, told him what I was looking for and what price I wanted. He called me back within 10 minutes and we moved forward with the paperwork. It was such a relief because many of the other dealerships in the area, such as honda cars of katy, were complete scams. They were experts not at selling cars, but at wasting their customers' time and energy. Honda cars of katy played many games with me in an effort to tire me out and just hope that I would accept whatever they threw at me, but I digress.

In any case, Spring Branch Honda was fantastic from beginning to end. The finance experience wasn't that bad at all. The manager offered me a few extras as he's supposed to do and when I politely declined he didn't push too much. I was in and out within 2-3 hours and the car looked like it had been thoroughly washed and detailed instead of a half-hearted attempt. 

I would highly recommend contacting Abraham if you are in the market for a Honda as he's a very hardworking and easy going salesman. Although he was juggling a few customers at the time, I never felt like I had to wait an unreasonable amount of time for him to tend to my needs. 

P.S. This dealership also had some delicious popcorn

When I got there, we had changed our mind about our needs and wanted a different car and then things went downhill, I was told that they were already running the paperwork for the first car I thought I wanted and that changing my mind was a very large inconvenience to her and continued to make me feel bad for changing my mind by bringing it at least too more times.

Second, instead of letting me look at a few choices, they picked one and started running the paperwork before we ever decided and without asking us what we thought or wanted.

Third, Wallace in finance made a mistake on the paperwork and I had to drive back across town (take time off from work) to re-sign everything.  

Forth, while I was re-signing the paperwork, I mentioned to Wallace that the locks on the vehicle were acting up.  He said to come back when I had time and we would arrange to have the locks back.  I asked if I had to wait until the warranty took affect and he said no, anytime is fine.  So I took time off to drive back across town and when I told Wallace why I was there, he told me that he made no such promise and that I would have to wait until the warranty took affect.

120,"July 10, 2011","I went into this dealer as a serious buyer, the initial meeting was friendly, test drove the car I wanted, liked it. After that I filled out the credit application and since it was late 9pm both the sales person and us decided they would run the application the next day to see if they could give me a better APR than my credit union.  Got a call from the dealer the next day and said he had great news and that they could offer me a better APR.  The price of the car was discussed on our initial meeting and once again confirmed by the sales person the day after, he did mention that the price was the best they could offer, so I said ok, I'm fine with that.  The sales person asked me when I would be able to come in and sign the contract, I told him I could come in that same day in the evening.  I made sure I told him the price and that he verbally confirmed that the price was final.  So I said ok, see you tonight.  40 minutes after our conversation the sales man called me to verify that I was coming in, I said yes, and then he says ""oh by the way I forgot to mention the car just went up $2000.00.... I was litteraly in shock of how he ""by the way"" told me the car price had gone up after we had talked various times, ran my credit and had 40 minutes earlier confirmed the final price.  To say the least, I was very upset and just told him, that deal  would not work for me and hung up.  He never gave any explination nor even tried to justify the price change.  A day later I get a call from the ""assistant business manager"" and said she was checking her records and saw I had come into their dealership but had not bought a vehicle.  She proceded to ask me why, so I told her.. I'm so glad she called because I was very disatisfied by their customer service and their sales person.  I told her the situation and incident and she apologized said that she understood my frustration and that she would have a talk with the general manager and he would defenetly give me a call to resolve the issue.  Well till today almost a month ago, I have not heard back from her NOR the general manager. You call that customer service????????????????????

Nevertheless, I went to another dealer and found the same vehicle with fewer miles at a wayyy better price, APR,and with excellent customer service, from start to finish.

Really, they couldn't tell me over the phone that their price was MSRP? Horrible, horrible, shady tactics. Anohter sales man came and told me he was the manager - Cesar Oliveira.

134,"February 20, 2011","My wife and I went into Goodson Honda West after our daughter Rachel Milford suggested giving the dealer a try.  Rachel works in the Goodson Honda Collision Center and knows first hand about the quality of Honda cars and the level of service customers receive at Goodson Honda. We had filled out the financing preapproval application at their website and I was contacted by Cesar Oliveira (Sales Director) within 5 minutes of submitting my applicaton online.  We discussed what we were looking for and made an appointment with Cesar later in the afternoon.  When we arrived he gave us his direct attention and we sat down again to discuss what type of vehicle we were looking for and more specifics such as color and he helped us determine what type of financing we could potentially use through Honda.  Cesar then turned us over to Nicholas Acevedo who had already arranged for us to test drive the car that we were looking for (2011 Honda Civic EX).  My wife loved the test drive but was still torn between deciding on the color (atomic blue or red).  There happened to be a red model on the showroom floor.  My wife and I decided we wanted to purchase the red model.  The guys immediately started moving the other showroom cars out of the way in order to move our red model outside to be prepped.  We headed to the financing office and met with Allaa Maayah.  In previous car buying experiences at other Houston dealers, dealing with the financing office had always been a stressful ordeal. This time it was not.  Allaa very quickly crunched the numbers and gave us our financing options.  He also told us about other options we could consider such as lowjack, extended warranties, GAP insurance, tire protection and windshield protection.  We added everything because it was actually very affordable and we wanted to protect our investment as we are planning to keep this car for a long time.

141,"December 31, 2010","I have to first say that I had no problems with my sales person Jeff Mond.  He was great, but everyone else was not.  I have been going to this dealership since 1998 for service on Hondas that I have owned and have purchased two cars from them as well.  I have referred a friend there and he over the years has bought three cars from them.  I have had good experiences with them in the past (which is why I kept going back).  

This last time was extremely dissapointing.  They did not want to give me anywhere near the trade in amount that I could get at CARMAX.  They wanted to give me $4000 less!  They blamed it on CARMAX being crazy and unrealistic.  I then checked out a Toyota dealership and they were going to give me $3500 more for my Honda than my Honda dealer!  I told them that I did not think all the other dealers could be crazy, but maybe Honda was not being realistic.  Why was everywhere else in town going to give me more for my Honda than my Honda dealer where I originally bought the car?!  Things got worse from there.  We came to a deal and I took the new car home.  They explained that it would take one to two days before knowing that Honda would officially approve the deal.  I asked if they felt pretty comfortable that it would go through as if it did not I would be bringing the car back and that would be a huge waste of everyones time.  They said there should be no problem.  

THREE days later I found out the deal did not go thru Jaime Demeris in finance barely made any effort to save the deal.  He offered purchasing instead of leasing with an inflated interest rate.  It was too much for me to afford so I guess he was tired of me and did not try any more.  He quickly wanted to find out when I would be returning the new car which I did two hours later.

144,"December 20, 2010","I have dealt with Goodson Honda West before and always have had a great experience. This new car purchase was no exception.

I initially spoke to Hee Kim, the new car sales manager, who then matched me up with Alejandro who helped show me cars. Alejandro was knowledgeable on the Civic and took time to explain various aspects of the car to me. If there was something that he did not know, he was upfront about it and took the initiative to go find out and get back to me. Once we found the car I wanted and we went to do the paperwork part of the deal. Alejandro was very patient while I filled out the forms and answered all the questions that I threw at him. Once the car was purchase and I had the keys, Alejandro took the time to sit with me in the car and explain the books, interior features, and he answered some questions that I had as well. It was late and I know that he and the staff were tired and ready to go home but he still took the time to do all those extra little things and that did not go unnoticed and I want to say that I appreciate all that he did for me that night.

I have dealt with several sales people on the certified used car side of Goodson Honda West but my experience with Alejandro on the new car side has proved to me that Goodson is the place for me to do all my future car purchases. Alejandro went above and beyond what I would have expected from a sales person and in the end he has earned my trust and loyalty as a customer. Kudos to him!

In the finance department, I also have to praise Scott Phan for all the hard work he put into getting my loan and making it all happen. I am not sure what magic that man worked but I cannot thank him enough for all his tireless dedication in making this all come together. Scott kept in constant contact with me and let me know what was happening every step of the way. My experience with the finance department was not great back in 2009 but dealing with Scott on this new 2010 Civic purchase has really made a positive impression on me and if all of the finance folks are as dedicated and honest like Scott is, then I look forward to dealing with Goodson Honda again soon!

So, with that all said, I want to say thanks to both Scott and Alejandro for the best car buying experience that I have had to date. The impression that both of them have made on me will keep me as a loyal customer of Goodson Honda West for many years to come and I give them BOTH top ratings in customer care, service, loyalty, and knowledge.

""Nobody beats a GOODSON DEAL"" and that's ******* lie. 

The worst dealership I have ever visited. My entire opinion about buying a Honda changed after a visit to the dealership. My negotiations on the phone were promising as they told they would beat any deal from another competitor and promised me a good car buying experience. After we reached the place the my car salesperson was a nice person, he was experienced and wanting to help, we test drove a few cars and once the pricing came into the picture things took a ugly turn, my salesperson could not beat the competitors price as the sales manager was not agreeing, he was rude and did not even want to talk to us. In the mean time they ran my credit and the I think I they probably employ the most rudest finance manager who thinks he owns HONDA himself and told directly that my credit application will not be approved. I felt they want to pull us down just because they could not beat the price. The finance manager told us to get financing from elsewhere and then we could talk about the car deal and he walked away. On the far end I had my salesperson trying to negotiate with his boss and nothing working out. I felt sad for the old guy, but he could keep us his promise and I felt very bad after the conversation with the finance manager. I was so upset I walked out and promised them never to return back. I peeped into their office and looked at their monthly target of 200 cars but they hardly cross 10.looking at the charts that this dealership tries to sell 200 cars every month but they hardly cross 10 suggestive of their unprofessional behavior and poor customer service.

150,"July 29, 2010","I was very dissappointed in the service I received from 3 of your new car salesmen.  I talked to Albie on the phone and he told me to come on in and he would take care of
me.  When I arrived at Goodson Honda West, I turned into the used car lot by error.  As I was turning around, I spotted a Civic, got out and looked at it.  Greg came out,
asked me if he could help and proceeded to show me the Civic.  I explained to Greg that I needed to be able to tow the Civic behind my motor home (MH), gave him a letter from Honda that authorized my 2001 Accord to be towed.  I asked him to contact
Honda and see if they would provide a similar letter for the 2010 Accord.

From there, I went to the new car sales on Saturday,  and asked for Albie.  He said that he was busy and handed me off to Darryl.  Darryl took me out to the lot to look at the cars.
I found an Accord that I liked.  As I was inspecting the Accord, Darryl walked back 
inside.  I wanted to see another car also, but when I looked for Darryl, he was not around.  I went back inside, found Darryl and asked him why he walked away.  She said that he wanted to check something with Albie.  It would have been nice if he had told me that he was leaving.  I told Darryl and Albie that I would like to purchase the 
Accord but it would be dependant upon my being able to tow the Accord behind my MH.

I provided them with a copy of a letter that was given to me by Honda which said that my 2001 Accord could be towed behind my MH for up to 300 miles or 6 hours if I performed a prescribed pre-tow procedure each time I wanted to tow the Accord.  

Albie, Darryl and Hee were all right there and I asked if they could contact Honda and see if Honda would provide a similar letter for the 2010 Accord.  Albie took the 
letter, said he would contact Honda on Monday and let me know what they said.  I had
not heard from him by Tuesday afternoon so I called and spoke to Albie and he said that he had not contacted Honda but was ""researching"" the situation.  I told him to
please contact Honda because only Honda could provide such a letter.  He said that he would.  It is now Wednesday night and I have yet to hear from Albie about whether he
has contacted Honda or not.  It is my belief that he has never bothered to contact Honda and now he wants me to buy a CR-V.

Yesterday morning, Greg called me, said he had contacted Honda and apparently they would not provide a letter authorizing me to tow a 2010 Accord.  I am pleased with the way Greg did what he said that he would do.

I have received two e-mails from Albie saying that he was very interested in making
sure that any questions that I had might be answered.....that he was concerned about
my having a pleasing experience with Goodson Honda.  If he was concerned about doing
what I aked, he would have contacted Honda about towing an Accord....apparently he
has not done this and does not plan on doing so.

If the answer from Honda, about towing the 2010 Accord, was negative I was planning on purchasing a CR-V because I have had two Accords, been very pleased with both and
I definitely want another Honda vehicle.

At this time, due to my experience with your salesmen, I have no interest in purchasing a CR-V from Goodson Honda West.  The only way I would purchase a 2010,
white CR-V from Goodson West is if Greg Emmitte handled the sale and Goodson knocked about $4,000 off the list price.

As I told Albie, Thanks......for nothing!!!!

First of all, they offer you a car with a bunch of crap added to it so that they can increase their margin on the sale. I told the salesman that I did not want all that crap and that I needed a better price, so he removed all these extra crap from the car, lowering the MSRP price because of that. When I asked him about lowering the price of the car again, he just replied: ""I already lowered it"", but that was because of all the extra stuff that was removed. Anyways, after haggling a lot I was able to pay the invoice price (which I don't believe it is the actual invoice price they pay Honda) of $17,140 for a brand new Honda Civic LX, which I know it wasn't a bad deal.

Well, my salesman who was rather nice for a car dealer came back with some numbers -the sticker price had not changed, and he gave a trade amount that was a joke. So we got up to leave. One of the mnanagers (Joe) chased us out of the building begging to make a deal. On the back of a buisness card he wrote the price for the car and the trade in amount. I told him I would have to think about it. I called about 30 min later to say I thought both numbers were fair and if he would have the paperwork ready I would be in later. What can I say? The number for the car had been jacked up and the amount for my trade in was somehow now part of the total price for the car, plus the pay-off. They went up 8k from the price he told me.

157,"January 07, 2007","DO NOT BUY FROM THIS DEALER.  I did all my research and got down to a price I should offer.  I landed on it, offered it..they accepted IN WRITING.  I was told I would qualify for the 0.90% financing with a credit score above 720.  When it came down to getting the financing, of course the store manager Cesar told me that I had to deal with a finance guy.  The finance guy proceeded to tell me that in order to get the 0.90% financing, I effectively would have to increase my purchase price $1,500 as the price negotiated was ""after"" the ""cash back"".  No where in our contract discussions was ""cash back"" discussed, mentioned or even written in the contract.  These guys are deceptive and I will be pursuing them to expose their practices.  DO NOT DEAL WITH THEM.  I recommend you go to Consumer Reports and buy a report for the vehicle you want.  Ask to see the terms of the financing UP FRONT.  Even if they say NO, then just leave.  Make sure you have read and understood their financing offers before you sign the contract.",1.0
158,"June 14, 2006","Wanted to purchase a Honda Fit.  Once he took the deposit, the story repeatedly changed about the expected delivery time.  Never replied to emails or voicemails.  Can never get him on the phone.

Finally had to complain to the president of the company to get him to return my call.  Cancelled the order.

Never will deal with him nor this dealer ever again.",1.4
159,"November 02, 2004","These guys far exceeded my expectations and I am a very hard customer to please. If you need your car serviced, go to Goodson Honda West on Old Katy Rd and ask for technician Ben Whorley. He is very experienced and knowledgeable. But don't take my word for it, find out for yourself.  I was also impressed with Josh U. (cust service) and Jeff Dahl's (cust service manager) patience and diplomacy in solving my problem.",5.0
