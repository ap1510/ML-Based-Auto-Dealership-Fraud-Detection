0,"March 19, 2020","Very unfortunate it’s come to this. My problem I believed in the beginning was an honest financial mistake that could’ve been fix. Unfortunately, due to the lack of communication as well as cooperation I’ve now been stuck with an auto loan that Scoggin-Dickey never paid off. 9 months later, my credit is now damaged, and the lender is looking for a vehicle I don’t have in my possession. Somehow Scoggin-Dickey was able to sell the vehicle without paying off my loan. Fraud?  Time to file a consumer complaint with the office of the attorney general. Consumers please read your financing paperwork word for word. I honestly believe my case was unique and hope that this never happens to anyone. ",1.0

8,"May 30, 2019","Typically, when I would think of car dealers and dealerships, my first thought would be scammers and liars who are very skilled at smoke and mirror tactics in order to sell products for far more than their true value but my experience with Scoggin-Dickey these last couple of weeks has been the contrary!!! CASEY DIXON has been fantastic, very kind and professional, HONEST AND FAIR!!! CASEY, along with JONATHAN WEBB and CHRIS CLARK, gave me every spec I requested for my 2019 Camaro at a very good price! Everytime I called Casey he was always so kind and accommodating!!! I was very pleasantly surprised at how they handled the finalizing of the deal, no smoke and mirrors!!  DAN MASSEY, in financing, was also very pleasant and professional and HONEST!!   I was truly shocked at the atmosphere and my whole experience with Scoggin-Dickey!!!  I will highly recommend Scoggin-Dickey to my family and friends!! ",5.0

Scoggin-Dickey Chevrolet Buick is the dealership we gave our business to, and we are happy we did!

I shopped with my father all around Lubbock looking for a new  ¾ ton truck equipped with a fifth wheel package. When we arrived at Scoggin-Dickey we were greeted by our salesman, Tevin Holmes. He was laid back and knowledgeable. Anything he didn’t know, he knew someone who did, and they were all more than happy to assist. We appreciated his no pressure, complete service attitude. He allowed us to test drive any and all trucks we were interested in and easily explained the differences in truck packages to us. We came to this lot and test drove trucks twice and the many many hours of shopping we did that very hot day, and never felt like we were a bother. That meant a lot to us.

When we showed Tevin  the other offers we had and what we were considering, he beat it. We were absolutely thrilled with the truck, the package, the amazing color and the price we were getting. They even delivered the truck to Pecos at no additional charge! 

Then we went to the finance department and met Dan Massey. My father was very nervous making such a huge purchase.  Again, Dan (the man!) was an absolute professional. He put us at ease in making such a big purchase by going through, line by line, breaking down each item into easily understood language and answering all of our many questions while referencing them in the written contract. He even got us an interest rate lower than quoted. 

Dan then took us to the truck manager, Chris Clark, to ease worries about getting our 5th wheel set up and delivery done by a certain date, only a few short days away. He promised he would have his guys in the service department on it right away. His promise was golden! 

When my father got home from work the truck was delivered on time, and the 5th wheel package was in place. We couldn’t be happier with our experience at this dealership. There is a reason they have been in business so long. I tried them and it’s true, Scoggin-Dickey is tops when it comes to auto sales!

I didn’t buy a brand new truck to have this happen, and then after it did get nothing in return from your joke of a staff. Literally that’s what I think about everyone that works there, a JOKE.

25,"May 22, 2017","I've been taking my car to this dealership to get my engine problems and they always say they fixed the issue and it was never resolved. Well I went to take my car back and it just happened the warranty expired and they were telling me it wasn't the engine that's been making that noise, it's the alternator. Well then why didn't you discover this when I had my warranty. It would stay in there shop for a couple weeks at a time and they never found this problem. Well now that my warranty is up they want me to pay them $600.00 to get my car resolved. Well if they would have determined the issue to began with this could have been avoided. I don't just have $600.00 to throw out there. I am a college student and am on a budget. They didn't even want to work with me. I had to pay $60.00 to even get my car back. And I took it home and parked it. I week later I go to get on my car to discover the air conditioners not working now. I called them and spoke with Jeff, and explained to him what was going on, and he told me if I brought my car back I would be looking at another $60.00 charge to have them look at it. I was furious. I don't like the way this so called manager spoke to me. Needless to say I am very dissatisfied. I popped my hood and took a look to see if it was possibly a fuse and these people left two screw drivers in between parts of my car. I would never recommend anyone to go there after this incident ",1.0

27,"January 13, 2017","This makes the 4th time my vehicle has been at this service center in 2 years.  Finally after fixing everything else possible, they said all it needs is new spark plugs.  This was at 4pm yesterday.  Still plenty of time to do that work and get my vehicle back to me before closing.  It's almost 3 pm and I'm told they're JUST NOW working on it.  We called several times yesterday to check on this service and I think it should have at least been mentioned that they couldn't get to it until late today so I could make other arrangements.  It has to be noted that MOST of the work that had to be done previously was a result of this same problem that it took 4 service visits to find.  They should be kissing my tail right now, considering all this bs and the fact that between my husband and myself, we're on vehicle #4 purchased from them. Seriously, it's been since 1:30 since we've called and they haven't let me know it's done yet.  How long does it take to change some freaking spark plugs??  ",1.6
28,"September 02, 2016","I called the day before(before noon) and asked about bringing in my 2012 Chev Silverado to have the transmission serviced. Wanted the unit flushed and the filter changed. Talked to Jeff and was told to have it in by 7:00 am the next morning. Had it at the service dept by 7 and checked it in. Again, told them what I wanted done and they assured me it would be taken care of. At 3:00 that day I called to see when it would be ready and was told it would be next week before I could get it back. That was a load of bull. I told them to just cancel the order and I would pick it up. When I got there I was told they were working on it and it would be ready in about an hour. After taking off work for 2 hours and waiting for two and a half hours I asked what the hold up was. I was told that the mechanic was waiting on a filter to arrive. Changing the filter on a trans requires that the pan be dropped and then replaced after the new filter is installed. I told them to forget the filter and within 20 minutes they had my pickup sitting out front. They had flushed the trans and refilled with fluid but took way longer and did not do what was instructed of them. 

While I was waiting there were two other customers there that had their vehicles returned and they had not been taken care of as they were instructed. One vehicle had been there three days and they called her and told her it was ready. Nothing had been done to it.

They are highly incompetent, lack communication skills and lie to the customers so they are not the one looking bad when things are not done as requested. THEY ARE A JOKE.

31,"February 13, 2015","I took my Silverado here because I received a low oil pressure warning. After they checked it out they said that I was several quarts low on oil which I had just checked not 3 days prior to the warning message. It was time for an oil change as well and was only 100 or so miles over. The service technician basically tried to make me feel like a complete idiot. The entire one on the phone he just seemed really fed up and didn't sound like he believed a word I said. I asked if there were any leaks and with a condescending ""what kind of stupid question is that"" voice, the technician pretty much told me it was my fault and that I need to check my oil more frequently. I won't be returning here anytime soon if I'm going to be treated rudely on the phone and if the technicians are going to make people feel stupid.",1.8
32,"January 14, 2015","I have owned 3 WRX's two serviced by Alderson and my 3rd at Scoggin. My first experience with the Service Department was right after they purchased the Subaru franchise from Alderson. I took the car in for the break in oil change. They had no knowledge my car needed to be serviced at 1000 miles. I have had this done previously on two WRX's as per the requirements for maintenance told to me by the person who sold me the car (told the same for the third). They used my owners manual to figure out how to change the oil and they charged me for something that should have been under the service plan. Knowing everything was new I went ahead and paid for the oil change as I wanted to build a good relationship with them starting out. I know they used the manual because they left grease and finger prints all over my glove box and owners manual on the how to change your oil page. I was thrilled to discover that after I paid for something I shouldn't have. None the less, I decided it was best to move on and accept they were still trying to get everything settled. Service number Two. I had an issue with the Brake Pedal switch that signals the tail lights. I figured out just recently the switch fails, the brake lights don't light, my ABS, Hill Assist, and Traction Control lights light the dash up. They had the car for 12 hours and stripped apart most of the interior consoles and failed miserably at putting them back together...my center console still does not close correctly for what looks like a switch that may need a click or two adjustment. It was so bad when I left I stopped turned around and made them snap pieces back together they left apart inside the car when they returned the car to me. I was thrilled to hear all the new noises my Subaru made after they loosened so many factory tightened bolts on the dash pieces. They also stated they could not find an issue. Service number Three. I requested they change my brake pads as they were worn out. They used vice grips and were so careless with my car that they ruined the painted surfaces on all 4 calipers. I contacted Subaru and reported them and requested to take the car elsewhere due to negligence. Subaru stated after submitting pictures and proving Scoggin had done the damage, that they have to make the repairs. I couldn't take the car to any other dealership. So I went back and all four calipers were replaced and at the time, I was satisfied with the job. After that I started hearing terrible popping sounds I took the car in because the scratch plate was missing clips and was worried the scratch plate was binding. 12 hours to put some of the plastic clips on I leave with the car and it's still making the terrible noise. I was also told they didn't replace all of the clips and that some were still missing. Those were on order and I would be called when they arrived. A month or so goes by and I find that the noise is from the brake pads that they just serviced. I called to schedule service and by this point I have drove on them awhile and am pretty concerned. They didn't seem to know I had any parts on order! For awhile now, each time I call for service they are a week out minimum. The people that I talk to on the phone always sound annoyed they have to talk to anyone. I started to pay attention over the last year and realized this place looks extremely overworked. I don't fault the Service Departments ability to accomplish what I have asked correctly. I fault the overall efficiency of the place and there not being enough staff to correctly deal with the influx of customers. This has been such a terrible experience over the last two years that I am considering selling what I consider to be my dream car cause I can't watch it fall to pieces due to horrible service. I never write reviews positive or otherwise but feel compelled to warn others in this case. I will also be reporting them to Subaru again. My advice if you live in Lubbock look elsewhere and don't by a Subaru. No matter how good of a car they are if you can't find someone who will take care of them, what is the point? If anything happens you will have to wait a week at minimum for them to just look at the car. Who knows how long for parts and them to actually fix the issue.",1.0

34,"September 27, 2013","I will NEVER go back to Scoggin-Dickey!!!! I had a service plan with Subaru that they would not honor saying that I had used it all up. Excuse me, I have the paperwork showing that I have the plan and I'm under the mileage and years! I agree with the poster who said they take advantage of women! If I had been a man, I don't think I would have had the same issue. Then on top of not honoring my service plan, they said that my air filter was incorrect (by the way, the dealership I purchased the car from put that in - I tend to believe them over these phonies!) All they gave me was a bunch of b.s. and that's just the nice terms for this website. On top of all that, I waited 40 minutes for a shuttle ride when I needed to be someplace - it's just a good thing I gave myself enough time. I've been to three Subaru service departments and to many others with other vehicles and this is BY FAR THE WORST I've ever been to. I will drive hundreds of miles to get the car back to where I purchased it from and have it serviced there just to avoid their crap!!!",1.0
35,"May 15, 2013","The service and parts department has to be the most incompetent set of people I have ever dealt with.  Communication is horrible, they return your calls weeks later. The car which took 6 months to be worked on was left out in the sun, improperly stored (oils, battery, suspension). The parts had to be sourced by myself from other dealerships here in country.  Their dealings with the manufacturers are also horrible as they DID NOT Honor warranty work. General Motors had to reimburse me a month later for their ineptitude. If I were you, I would NEVER deal with these people. These employees need to be replaced.",1.2

We had to go ask him to come back so we could speak to him. We asked him why we were told that and he said he has been in this business 22years (like that makes a difference). Never answering what I asked him. We will never go back there again or recommend them to anyone. That was the worst experience I have ever had with a salesperson.

48,"April 11, 2012","I have been doing business with Scoggin Dickey over 2 years purchasing 4 new cars.  During this time sales, management, service, and body shop have been outstanding.  I can say that I don't know any dealerships in Lubbock that honors a loaner at no cost when your new vehicle is in the service department or body shop.  Being the main provider for my family transportation is a must at all times for me.  I can say that the sales department is always willing to go above and beyond the call of duty for all customers.  As for the service department I'm always informed either by a phone call or an email of the status for repairs.  When I have done business with the body shop my car wasn't released until I visited with the manager of that deparment.  I don't know if it's policy, but to me that shows caring.  If there is something wrong they will get right on it to make it right before the vehicle is released.  Finally management, I can honestly say that they make me feel like family.  When I have come in the past with a situation they put their heads together and come up with a solution.  There are not many businesses out there that have the family atmosphere and very professional.  This dealership has my highest and up most respect and recommendation for all new car buyers.

49,"November 15, 2011","Initial visit paid $650 for a battery and two cables on my corvette.  I wouldn't usually pay that much, but I was assured it would fix my electrical problem and it had to be all factory equipment.  Didn't fix my problem so it was time for round 2 and I was not as trusting as the first.  I decided to look into some parts pricing from my first bill and the second quote.  I called their parts department and the parts necessary were much cheaper over the counter than through the service department. (never asked for a discount from the first bill, but figured they would help me some on the second)-(Not trying to get anything for FREE)  Informed my service advisor that it was cheaper to walk in and purchase the items than go through him and he let me know that's how they do business.  ""I was welcome to walk the parts from parts department to service, but he wouldn't warranty their work at that point.""  Almost $1600 later they had my Corvette ready to go.  If they were knowledgable about what was going on it would have only been a $400 part and couple hours labor.

50,"June 03, 2011","Horrible service dealership.  They will void warranty and not work on your car using the dumbest excuse possible.  Since when are tinted windows a mod that voids warranty?  Marmolejo (""service manager"") will do anything to not get his hands dirty.  Issues with misaligned panels?  They wont cover it.  Issues with AC?
""Oh we didnt do anything but its working the way its supposed to"".  Transmission is missing shifts?  ""Oh you need a Tranmission flush"" (mind you its a sealed transmission that isnt flushed).  When they do cover a part, its takes them MONTHS to get the part in, and then you need to schedule a few weeks ahead of time and leave them your car the entire day for them to replace a molding or even a small part.

Stay away, they suck, worst service in TX.  Ive had my car serviced in San Antonio and Austin, and these individuals suck at service.

52,"August 15, 2005","I bought my '03 Silverado Ext Cab from a salesman named James Craig who is no longer with the dealer.  During the course of my ownership of this vehicle, several service and warranty issues have come up.  The people in the service center couldn't be more pleasant to deal with.  They accomplish the work in a timely manner and are eager to answer any and all questions.  They also have a shuttle service that will take you wherever you need to go while the service is being done and they'll pick you up to bring you back to the dealership.  I also had the unfortunate incident where a 13 year old kid stole his dad's vehicle and smashed it into my truck while it was parked in my driveway.  I then employed the services of the Scoggin-Dickey body shop.  They were just as friendly and had my truck repaired in the time quoted to me.  From the sale of my truck to the ongoing service and beyond, Scoggin-Dickey is the best place to buy your Chevrolet, Buick or HUMMER!",4.8
