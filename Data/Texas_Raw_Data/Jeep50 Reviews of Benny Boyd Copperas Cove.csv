8,"March 20, 2020","They were very helpful in assisting us with finding the exact kind of vehicle we were looking for. The first one they had for us didn't quite meet our expectations when we were allowed to take it home for the day to experience it forst hand. Mrs. Crichlow was able to track down another vehicle at a seperate lot and it met all of our expectation and within our target price range.

11,"February 09, 2020","Dealership was clean, organized and very professional.  Will do business with this team again. Started my search at this dealership first and talked about several cars and including cars from other lots. Visited 4 or 5 other lots looking for new and used late model cars where high pressure sales tactics were used. One of the other dealerships salesman was not that informed about cars. Went back to Benny Boyd because of knowledge and willingness to get cars from any lot in Texas.  ",5.0

49,"January 24, 2016",Worst salesman out there. Asked to look at trucks in a certain price range and Tim S. starts trying to run a loan application. When I told him I wanted to find a truck before I do an application he said he wants to make sure there is money to buy one. He then became rude and told me to have a nice day when I stated I was not going to do a loan app till AFTER I find a truck. After reading other reviews I think it's just how they run the business there. Really sucks because I really wanted to take a look at two trucks they have. Went to Dodge Country and was treaty a million times better.,1.3
