0,"June 17, 2020","Made 2 appts in May for multiple service on my Explorer:
in a May, needed state inspection, oil change, spark plugs replaced and 4 recalls that i’ve been trying to get fixed for the last 3 years.
Had questions I wanted answered before i arrived at shop.
Was told both times in May that the service advisor for me would call me either the same day i made appt or the next day to answer my questions. Was assured both times by the call center girls in Lewisville that they were sending a message to the advisor to call me, before i hung up from making my appts.
No calls the first time, until 4hours after i didn’t show. When asked why i wasn’t called, no response or idea why. 
Made the 2nd appt and i stressed that i needed to ask questions before i show up, because my partner will only allow me to drop it off and not spend 15 minutes trying to get my answers. 
We are both high risk and need to limit contact with public.  I was totally assured on the 2nd appt that i would get a call back, none, until after my appt time, again.  Asked him what was on the ticket. Only an oil change.  There is a broken chain of command gor appts.

So, in June, i had to go get the Explorer inspected elsewhere so i could get it registered, late.   Wasn’t happy with that.
I’ve tried calling the service advisors directly but their line just rings and rings and rings and is never answered.
I called the girls at the call center again trying to get to an advisor and the girl had the same trouble, no answers at the shop.
She assured me that a manager would call me, yesterday and it is Wednesday and still no call.

Do i have to take my Ford to a Chevy or Dodge dealership for service???",1.3
1,"May 07, 2020","Sales people lie to get you in there, charge too much give WAY too little for trade in. Also their service is the worst they always forget to balance the tires air pressure, reset the oil change system and who knows what else they slack on.. not to mention they charge way too much and have no respect for veterans",1.0

3,"February 18, 2020","I got a bad service at this dealer either I bought a brand new vehicle from them.
When bring up my vehicle for service ( do oi change) and my appointment was booked  in advance, but they let me sitting there almost for 4 hours with do noting. Until I come to ask them about my vehicle, then they start to bring up my vehicle in to shop. I try to see the shop manager but they don't want to speak to me either, and I try to send many email and make many phone call but with no respond and say anything to customer to resolve the problem. I am going to sale my Ford now and will buy another one with different brand name.And never never come back to this dealer again.
All managers so bad, service so bad ",1.0
4,"February 18, 2020",worked with the salesman dell on purchasing a new ford truck. I was calling from far away so wanted all the information up front so I didn't waste a trip since I am from East Texas. They hit my truck so low that it was pathetic and had absolutely no reasoning as to why. I sent them values on my truck and never heard back from them. Glad I didn't waste a trip to this dealership. ,1.0
5,"February 17, 2020","If I can give 0 stars I would.I normally do not write bad reviews but I felt like I had too.I had an appointment to have my car that I bought 3 weeks ago already have a check engine light checked.Only to be told that I will have to leave the car fo 4-5 day until someone will look at it.I offered to bring it when they are ready they said no.Of couse they do not have loanera and I have to pay for a rental even though it was covered with insurance.
I left and I am glad I did as I read all the NEGATIVE reviews here.Will find a dif dealership.
Sadly I have to say they lost our business. My husband has a brand new F150 Platinum and I drive Expedition Limited.
I will make sure to write reviews everywhere and to warn people.Please do not waste your time there.They do not treat you like customer.Avoid at any cost possible.",1.0
6,"January 29, 2020","This is my second review for this pace and I don’t ever write reviews but I feel a need to write so maybe others can stick to their gut feeling and the knowing how their car was working before it was talked in. 
Ever sense a recall back in June of 2019 on my 2017 Ford Explore due to an AC problem my car has been in that shop 4 times over the corse of 4 months. my whole heater core was replaced and my whole AC adapter and some crazy stuff about it blowing metal into my whole system and then a whole bunch of other things as well that were never really explained to me well. They kept my vehicle at least a week each time and 2 weeks at one point. Which I did have it under warranty for and just had to pay taxes for my rental but having it out for so long I paid a total of 500 dollars thru the corse of this time. Every time I got my car back something wasn’t working right. Long story short after trying to have them fix it they told me I was wrong and that they had fixed everything and the noises I was still hearing were just “normal” now due to the recalls on the vehicle, not to mention they wrote blue ink all along my drivers door on my light leather and I had to spend 50 dollars to get it off, so annoying. In the mist of this I tried to buy a new vehicle (fearing my vehicle would have more problems in feature) and got sexually harassed by one of the managers there (another long crazy story). So didn’t but a new vehicle and wanted to just keep mine and they reassured me nothing was wrong with my vehicle and treated me like I was just making things up now and when I would make appointment for other things like new tiers, another recall on the vehicle and alignment they never returned my phone calls. So I took my vehicle into Bob Tom Ford (being serviced right now) they replaced the heather motor and said it was bad and found a few more things as well. I will never go back to Ford Frisco even tho they said I have 4 “gas vouchers” waiting for me to help with all the mess. I was nothing but nice and patient, too nice apparently and can’t help but feel so annoyed at how they made me feel like I was making things up about my car and really they just were tiered of having my car in their shop and were done with it. I knew my vehicle wasn’t fixed and I’m so glad I didn’t give up before my warranty was up and got it fixed with someone else that hopefully are better then this place. Just a all around frustrating experience. 

Oh and Hawk was so aggressive and said “we are not on the same page at all”. But now my car is being fixed for the same things I had concerns about with him. Totally out of line.

Naomi was The lady who helped me and did a good job but was clearly tiered of my phone calls as well, as was I. ",1.0
7,"January 04, 2020","The worst customer service I have ever experienced! The service tech rep lied to me over and over. Had my truck for days. Would not tell me the truth when asked about a time frame.  I wish that I could give them
 0 stars!!! ",1.0
8,"December 09, 2019","I don’t want to give them one star.   I am actually stunned by the treatment I received. I have a 2018 Ford Escape.  I had the engine replaced when it had only 11,000 due to a warranty covered issue.  I was out of my car for 30 days.   At 21,686 miles the check engine light came on again and I tried to get my car in to be looked at.      The manager Hawk knows me by sight.  However the tech assigned to my car was joe.  Joe pulled the code and it was the exact same code it pulled with the first engine change.  Which almost always means the same issue is going on.  He proceeded to tell me that it code be rodent damage and that they wouldn’t be able to look at it until the next week and that I would have to get a rental.  They told me there would be a deposit and taxes due. I told them that they are obligated to put me in a loaner because it’s most likely a covered warranty issue. (Due to history) also it’s a  known issue  and rodents do not go near the cylinders.  And that particular code is never related to rodent damage.  I asked them to please cover the rental, but they said no.  They could refund me the deposit and the taxes,  or the rental place would refund it. (I have never ever been refunded for rental deposits-and I put gas in the car and I don’t leave trash in the car.)  After speaking with another “manager” on the phone after I left the dealership because I was upset and decided I would wait another day or two.  I spoke with another dealership and they told me they would take my car and put me in a rental with a 50 deposit and no taxes.  I went ahead and called this dealership back because normally I get better treatment and I try to stay loyal.  I was told that their would be a deposit only.  But they never said how much.  When I went in to drop my car off they told me it would be 200$ deposit.  And the person proceeded to tell me that he told me the amount on the phone.  I never would have agreed to come in for that amount.  I want everyone to know that this dealership is full of thieves and liars.  And I will never ever visit Frisco autonation again.  They have lost my business and I will make sure to tell every single person I know that service is terrible and they knowingly sell cars with defects.   Also, by the way. My car does need a new engine.  So, your poor treatment was rude and uncalled for.",1.0
9,"October 10, 2019","I sold the used care I bought from them within 3 months and am due a refund of my extended warranty and maintenance plan I purchased.  I supplied the dealer with all the appropriate paper work, including the form saying the car was paid off in full, so the refund would come directly to me.  Its been 6 weeks and nothing, and when I call to inquire, I get know answers.  It amazes me how when they are taking your money they are all over it, but when they owe the consumer money it takes for ever to get your HARD EARNED MONEY BACK.  xxxxxxxx.",1.8
10,"September 27, 2019","I purchased a new transit connect here.  This is our service truck for a small business I run. No truck, no money coming in.  The transmission went out a month ago.  I took it in at that time, was told the part was on backorder for 3 weeks.  Ok fine..this vehicle has 42,000 miles on it now.  Full warranty.  I was offered a loaner for 4 days.  The rep had enterprise pick me up...they asked for 200.00 and the taxes.  So we did not take the so called loaner.  This last Monday, we dropped the vehicle, as the rep had called me and said they were ready to do the work.   He said it should be done Tuesday.   Then Wednesday, and so on.  Here we are Friday, no vehicle and now being told Monday,  this is damaging my business severely.  No one seems to care.  Our rep is very nice.  That’s about the only nice thing I can say.  This is not the first issue here.  We had a air conditioning vent that was broken in the 1 st month of ownership, and a blowout of a brand new tire.  They denied warranty on both.  This is not how service should be...i have serious doubts that the vehicle will be repaired at all.  I’m pretty sure we will have many visits...and in the meantime, keep making payments on a vehicle we can’t drive.",1.8

13,"August 11, 2019",Went in to see a certain truck...worked with Tommy Keith. He walked my soon to be 16 year old through the differences between the two trucks we ended up looking and at while we were there and answered all our questions.

14,"August 02, 2019","This was by far the worst customer service experience I have ever had. My husband and I were in the market for a new expedition. We came into the lobby and not a single person greeted us. We had to track a sales person down who said they would be with us soon. Fifteen minutes later, we got tossed around a few times until we met Cory. We had our eye on a very specific car and were wanting to talk a price that afternoon. We had to go back home to relieve our babysitter, but asked Cory to call us with a price and that we would be very interested in proceeding with the sale. He wrote down our info and promised a call. Well, here we are, three weeks later and not a single call was attempted. We are proud owners of another car from another brand simply because we were wowed with exemplary customer service. I appreciate not being hounded at a car dealership but it is beyond me as to why none of these sales individuals had a desire to even greet us or help us with the sale- we were practically willing and able to make a sale for them that day. Very disappointed. ",1.0
15,"July 13, 2019","Bought a 2012 Nissan Sentra in February of this year. Within a month, the car had lost acceleration. My son was out of town at the time, so he took it in to a local mechanic - diagnosis, car needs a new transmission for $4,000. We called autonation and their solution was to sell us their aftermarket “warranty” for $3,600. We did so and my son took it in to the local Nissan dealership, who found a “theft prevention devise” that they had to removed. It’s looking like a scam at this point. 

About a month later, the car is demonstrating the same problem as before. This time, dealer agrees transmission is bad. Good news is, because we purchased the warranty, the $4,800 repair tab is only the $200 copay. 

So, we now have over $9,000 invested (including the two $200 copays and the original mechanic’s diagnosis) in a 7-year old vehicle with over 120,000 miles on it. I would never purchase another vehicle - used or otherwise - from this dealer. ",1.4
16,"April 20, 2019","Absolutley terrible sales experience! I need people to know how the snakes at Autonation work.

I custom ordered a mustang GT back in December 2018. It was optioned out & one of a kind! Well after delays by Ford themselves it finally arrived 4/5/2019. Mind you I didn't receive a call that my vehicle arrived, I had to contact Autonation days later as Ford's tracker sucks!

Well I had plans to pick up the vehicle Friday 4/12/2019 but had an emergency to take care of. Monday 4/15/2019 I get a call from the Sales Manager, Cory Dalgetty, that my custom ordered, deposit-held vehicle has been SOLD! Yep, a car I had to wait 4 months to arrive, was sold from under me in just a few days.

This is my first & last experience with Ford, after all the recalls, delays & poorly trained employees. I'm sure it's a decent place to buy a plain F150 on the lot, plenty of those! Don't let the basic purchase reviews fool you!

So don't waste your time trying to get a custom order, or even anything in general. These idiots don't know how to place a ""SOLD"" sign on a purchased vehicle. You'll waste time waiting anxiously only to be given a weak apology & the opportunity to relive the experience by ordering again.

Screw Ford, screw Autonation!",1.0
17,"April 11, 2019",There have been so many issues over the past year with this place but here are the two worst. After working on my car last year they messed up my air conditioning. A while later my check engine light came on and they looked and found nothing. A week later my check engine light came on and again they couldn't find anything. One week later my car broke down in Colorado with a broken turbo and we had to leave it and rent a car to take to Utah. THIS WEEK I took my car in for a tire repair and oil change and they told me my brakes were bad. Not just BAD but SO shot that the car's rotars were worn down and needed to be replaced. I didn't trust them because of what happened last year and turns out my brakes are almost NEW!!! So they either have THE DUMBEST mechanic on the planet working there or the most DISHONEST mechanic. Either way I will never be back. And I rarely post bad reviews but this review is going all over.,2.0
18,"April 11, 2019","Bought a used VW from Autonation in November of 2018.  Requested second key.  Noted in paperwork.  After almost 3 months of trying to get them to make key, found out their key maker can not make VW keys.  Was told to go to VW dealership down from the ( another place I won’t return) and buy key.  Drop off copy of receipt.  Did so.  $313 key.  Never received reimbursement.  Called and was told they would call back.  One of many unreturned calls.  Filed with BBB.  They refused to respond.",1.6
19,"February 02, 2019","Terrible customer service and misleading sales tactics. Susan wasted a majority of our time negotiating on the wrong vehicle and her inability to communicate effectively or even simply understanding any part of our communication with her. Also, Mark made statements in an attempt to make a deal with us that he ended up reneging on later. Total waste of time and energy. There are much better Ford dealers in the area that actually want to take care if their customers. ",1.2
20,"January 13, 2019","After working with AutoNation Ford for so many years today was the worst experience I have had with any service for a long time.
I brought my Ford Explorer for scheduled service almost 2 weeks ago. I asked to look into  the driver outside door handle that was loose but still functional as proven by the pre-repair pictures they take before service. They told me that was not no covered by Platinum Vehicle Protection Plan  that I bought from them and it will cost approximately $100 to fix. 
I told them mot to proceed as I will try to fix at later date.  When I went to pick up the car the handle was completely nonfunctional. 
I took it back today to repair. Today they tell me that because of some damage done to handle inside rod which they did it themselves in that 1st visit I have to pay $650 to have it repaired.
The Service Adviser rude lady had the audacity to say that it is not their mechanic fault to make damage worst as it was broken in the first place. 
I have placed a complain to the BBB to get a resolution.

21,"November 17, 2018","I am very unsatisfied with my service, on Saturday (Nov 2) I brought my vehicle in for a broken outside driver side door handle. A full detail diagnostic was ran on the door and I was told it would only need one part to order and it would be in on Tuesday. I couldn't make it on that day due to work. I came in Saturday at 8:30 am for my 9 am appointment and dropped off my car. I called the dealership around 1:30 pm and an tech answered the phone and told me it would be ready in an hour. I received another call 30min later and was told the door needed an additional part and it would be $30 extra  dollar ( which they gave for free because it was tgeir fault), yet this I assumed should've been discovered during the full detail diagnostic. I took my car in on Monday to get the door fixed. I was told it was only going to be a 45min- 1hour wait so i stayed at the dealership. Once an hour had passed i went to go check on the process. When i looked through the garage window I could see the mechanic under my hood which alarmed me because i have observe the job multiple times on youtube  being done and in different videos the person didnt go under the hood. I asked what they were doing and was informed me they were topping off my liquids, a free service that comes with the repair. Thats very nice but I would have like to be informed of that part of the process because now my vehical is leaking and im having a very hard time turning my steering wheel. If you look at my orginal diagnostic, you can see that those were not issues initially. Also, when i looked under the hood there seems to be a wire out of place. Im not understanding how this can be since i only went in for a broken door handle. So I called they wanted me to bring the car in to run another $155 diagnostic. That shouldnt be so, since I only seem to accumulate these problems only after my visit to the dealership. This is terrible, I just want my car fixed!!",1.8

23,"October 11, 2018","I looked for a certain truck, with a certain color, with a certain engine, and had to have certain other options.  I looked everywhere from Florida to TX and finally found not 1 but 2 at Auto-Nation in Frisco.  I went up there and after checking out the new trucks on the lot for about 2 minutes a salesman named Jon Roberts came up and introduced himself.  I told him what I wanted and he took me to another part of the lot to see the trucks.  Had a great experience test driving and negotiating a price.  Jon was a great help and never give me the normal salesman pushiness.  I went though the closing/loan process with Joanne Toth.  She did a great job of explaining the process and I even bought an extended warranty which I have never done before.  All in all a very good experience! ",5.0
24,"September 30, 2018","After a couple attempts to purchase a used 2017-208 Ford F-150, Dennis Gooding of Autonation Ford in Frisco, helped me purchase a new 2018 Ford F-150 Lariat for a better price and financing than any of the used trucks I had looked at.  Not only did Dennis help me he did everything he could possibly do to help me get my new truck.  I had gone to Grapevine Ford after talking to their internet director (he Said) and he felt he would be able to help me purchase a used 2018 ford.  After arriving after driving all across town, they basically told me they couldnt do the deal and let me leave.  

Dennis not only did the deal but was aware of financing arrangements by Ford that saved me thousands of DOLLARS!  Just wanted to thank Dennis and the Managers on Duty Friday for working with me to help me purchase my new Ford Truck.

Thanks again, Dennis I will do my best to send people your way.

27,"June 06, 2018","I bought a used car one weekend from AutoNation Ford in Frisco and it had just been traded in to the dealership. Of course I understood that buying the car meant that I had to wait until the paint and mechanics were available. I was told the car would be ready the following Monday. I get a text that Saturday night from their financial manager and she says she forgot to charge me $267!!! Whose fault is that?! 

Monday rolls around and they do not have the car ready because they said “the 30% chance of rain is risky to paint in”. I understand that, but I checked the weather and it was not going to rain after 11 am that day. 
I get a call the day after, which was a Tuesday, and they tell me the car is ready. I drive up to the dealership with my mom to pick up the car and didn’t even drive the car off the lot and there was a nail in the tire. The service men tell me I have to pay $148 for a car I have not driven off the lot yet!!! I demanded a sales manager. They paid for the replacement tire but made me wait another day. 
I get a call on Wednesday saying the car will be ready around noon. I call back at 2:30pm the same day to ask if it was ready, the receptionist answers and is extremely rude to me as I called wanting to speak to a manager!! She directs me to a manager but nobody answered!!!! 
I get a call at 3:15pm saying the car is now ready, my mom and I are livid at this point so we go get the car. And the sales manager decided it was appropriate to talk down to us like we don’t know the situation. My dad and I were the ones to purchase the car but my mom was the one who came with me to pick it up, and the manager said “ma’am you were not involved in this purchase you don’t know what you’re talking about.” What happened to the customer is always right!?

29,"April 13, 2018","If I could give this dealership a negative 100 I would. Please let my story serve as an example of why you consider going ANY where else you can than to AutoNation Ford Frisco to purchase a car. I bought a 2010 Cadillac Escalade EXT for $33,000, including a $3500 (2 yr 24,000mi warranty) I paid $575/mth for 13 months before my engine went out. I purchased the truck with 85000 mi, my warranty expired at 109998, I now have 111081 on the car, warranty expired. I take the car to the dealer asking if they can still honor the warranty, of course not, I contact the warranty Co to honor the warranty, of course not. I then ask the service director about helping me with this car they just sold me somehow, he goes on to tell me they will cut their labor cost to install an engine on the car, which was quoted at $11000 with Sewell of Dallas. I come back the next day with a proposal to purchase a second used car from AutoNation at some sort of discount and was offered great Customer service from their fleet manager. I was ready to purchase a car cash and they weren’t willing to extend me any form of gratitude for me even considering making a second purchase after this terrible situation. $45k in 14 months off two used cars, the dealer almost made and I’m out $56k - In 14 months.

32,"January 13, 2018","Autonation Ford Frisco, TX had a vehicle I was interested in.  I stopped by and took a look at the vehicle and they took a look at my trade.  I told them I would come back the next day with my wife, granted the amount they could offer on my trade was decent.  A couple hours later, I received a call from the used car manager asking me about my experience and stating that my trade-in value was between $10,000 and $12,000.  I told him that $10,000 was too low for me to do the deal but if they could do somewhere in the $12,000 range, I could make that work.  He agreed and said, ""yeah, that shouldn't be a problem."" Consequently I came back the next day, ready to do the deal and when it came down to my number on the trade they offered me $9,600.  I asked to speak to the manager and he gave me a long speech about the value of my vehicle and how it wasn't worth anywhere near the $12,000.  I shared with him, that the problem I had with the dealership was not that they couldn't give me what I wanted for my car, the problem was integrity.  If you can't get me where I want to be, then don't tell me you can.  The manager could have saved me and him a lot of time if he would have just been honest.

A few days later my car stalls several times in traffic and they tell me that it is now over $700 to fix and I need a fuel pump. Every service department I call tell me since I have a 2014 with low miles, it is very unlikely I need a pump and it is probably a sensor that is much cheaper to repair. When I asked my service tech, John Malinowski, why this was not discovered before when they had my car all day and ran several tests, he tells me ""we only did a partial test on it and that was just for the battery."" Are you serious?! You had my car literally all day and you only tested the battery and proceeded to tell me, the customer, that my battery was in fact the problem when you haven't fully tested everything?

48,"October 29, 2016","Their sales team seems incredibly disorganized. I went in to buy an F150, it happened to be at the Auto Nation over in Fort Worth. The web site had the truck listed at one price. The MSRP of the price at Auto Nation Ford Frisco was $2500 more than the MSRP the truck was listed for at the Fort Worth dealership. A manager was trying to convince me they put an incorrect price on the website. Great!

This dealership really does not seem like they know what they're doing. I passed on buying the car because the numbers just don't add up with these people. Why should the ""final price"" be different at the dealership than it is on the website? 

The salesperson was friendly but management seems to have no clue what they're doing. They certainly try to pull on kinds of tricks on you. I would avoid doing business with Auto Nation at all costs. There are plenty of professional dealerships out there. Stay away from this one!

If the online price was the actual final price (before taxes, etc) the deals would be somewhat competitive. FYI - they would not negotiation on a new vehicle at all. ",1.4
49,"October 27, 2016","While the below review is accurate at the time of posting I would like to post my respect for the team at AutoNation Ford of Frisco. The acted as true professionals.

I am proud to say I bought my Ford from this team. I will happily service my car at their dealership. I will not hesitate to refer my colleagues, friends and family to them. And when I am in the market for a new ride they will be the first place I stop. 

Way to go AutoNation Ford Frisco!

The purpose of this letter is to express my profound dissatisfaction with the service I experienced at Bob Tomes AutoNation Ford in Frisco on October 26th, 2016. 

From 5:30PM to 9:15PM I acted in good faith to purchase a new 2017 Ford Mustang EcoBoost Premium. This included:
•	Meeting multiple sales representatives; the main contact being DT Carter
•	Meeting two of the Managers, John Donawho and someone else
•	Dealing with two separate finance representatives
•	Car requirements
•	Purchase and trade-in car inspections
•	Purchase negotiations
•	Finance negotiations
•	Ultimately a failed contract to purchase

I was put in a bait and switch situation which ended poorly to say the least. We agreed upon a grey ecoboost premium. My goal was to be at $300/mo. We agreed upon $339/mo. 

When the paperwork was finally completed I was the last customer in the building.

It turns out that between sales and financing the paperwork had become a lesser, black, ecoboost – no premium edition. 

I cannot explain how frustrated and diminished I felt at that point. Your sales representatives sold me one car and your finance people processed paperwork on another car. This is illegal. 

Purchasing a car is a personal decision that involves both my pride and my ego. To be taken advantage of this way made me feel like I was less of a person. 

During negotiations your Manager John stated “… a car is just a car, but there is only one of you…” Furthermore the Sales Rep DT promoted himself as “ …called to serve people...”
There is a simple sign that hangs at the front door that reads “…Tomes Ford greater customer satisfaction…” 

None of these things appear to be true given my experience. 

I am giving you an opportunity to correct what I consider a deep, personal wrong from your organization. Rest assured that if this is not corrected I will make sure my experience is shared and reviewed through all options available to me.

When I arrived no one knew anything about the appointment.  I told them up front that I had no interest in having any ""negative equity"" rolled over.  If I could term my lease as they had suggested I had no interest in going forward.  I quickly found out that is some type of sales ploy and was never the intention.  Their sales people are unprofessional, and they pay almost no attention to their customers.  I probably won't lease another Ford anyway but if I was planning to I would go to any other dealer first.

52,"July 06, 2016","DO NOT BUY A CAR FROM HERE!!! We first bought a used GMC Terrain from this dealership in February 2016. We heard a noise but was reassured of their 160 point inspection all their cars go through so we pulled the trigger and bought the car. Within the first 6 weeks we were in and out of the service department and they could not figure out what the problem was until the 3rd time we brought it in and it was of course a major issue, the timing chain. The dealership took the car back if we were to buy another car from them. We learned from our mistake and decided to go new so we wouldn't have anymore issues. We sat at the dealership for 12 hours to purchase a new 2016 Explorer, due to the fact no sales person wanted to do the deal with us because they didn't want to deal with the trade in of the Terrain even though this was all approved by the GM, Josh Patterson, who is NEVER in the office he is always on vacation and he nor anyone else will call you back. Finally the AGM Dustin, decided to sit down and do the deal with us and we finally walked out of there at 9pm. Was so happy with my new car until it started making a cranking/creaking noise by the right tire. I took it in the first time, drove around with them to let them hear it, in which they did,  and they thought it was the suspension, but couldn't find anything wrong with it. Brought it back in a second time, had another mechanic ride with me, even have it recorded and he thought it was the right strut. They ordered a new part and fixed it. On my way to go pick it up I get a call that its still making the noise and that's not the problem. They keep it longer and the next week I get a call that it was something to do with the body seam that something wasn't tightened enough during factory and they fixed it. I was assured I would NOT be back again for this. I leave the dealership and drive down Legacy and what do I hear the FREAKING NOISE AGAIN. I immediately call back to tell them, even record it again as proof, and was told not to bring it back yet. I tried calling the person in charge since the GM Josh is of course on Vacation, which is Vince. He wont return my phone call since this place has the WORST Customer Service and doesn't fix any problems after you have purchased a call from them. They just want you to buy and then they wipe their hands clean from you. The service department said I cant bring it back until next week since in which the Director of the Service department will ride with me.

56,"September 02, 2015","NOTE TO ALL POTENTIAL FORD BUYERS:  If there was a NEGATIVE TEN rating, this dealership would get it.   DO NOT waste your time with Auto Nation Ford in Frisco, TX.   The story starts like this, I bought a Jeep Compass which after 2 weeks I did not like.  A family member works for another Auto Nation Ford dealership in Florida and tells me why are you wasting your time with Jeep when you can go to our dealership right down the street and get 0% financing for 72 months and get a lot nicer vehicle for your money.  So, I drove about 1/4 of a mile up the road and spent 2 hours there and was told by Sales Manager, dont worry about it, we'll take good care of you, this was on Monday late afternoon on (8/31/2015), they could not get the payoff information on my Jeep because the bank was closed, So, I drove back there yesterday (9/1/2015) to be told that if I want to buy one of their vehicles to take advantage o the 0% financing for 72 months that I would have to put down $3300 in cash.

I asked my sales guys (Cheyne and Dean) 5 times at least, how are things going and they tell me everything is looking good.  I don't understand why a car dealership would put me through this as I also asked them numerous times what is the monthly payment on a 2015 Ford Escape, he never told me a number.  I dont understand why we just didn't cease all communications at that point.  

GETTING BETTER, KEEP READING, I then was told by the Sales Manager (Corey Dalgetty) he would talk to the General Manager of the dealership who was ""out hunting"" yesterday (9/1/2015) and he would see if an exception could be made as the GM at this dealership has some “magic dust” he can sprinkle to “make things happen"" with Ford Financing.    I get a call  this morning (9/2/2015) from Dean in Sales asking me when I was going to be at the dealership to pickup the car, then an hour later, I get a call back from Corey, the guy whose been with Ford 18 years, and was told that the only way to get that Ford Escape, per the GM is to now put $6000 in cash down.  Do these guys talk to each other?  OMG!!!

I would highly recommend the GM and his entire team take lessons from Frisco Chrysler Jeep Dodge Ram right down the road from their dealership, I went right back yesterday (9/1/2015) after after being told about the $3300 in cash down and worked with Frisco Chrysler Jeep Dodge Ram's Managing Partner Shawn Swenson (who obviously knows and understands the true meaning of Customer Service) of that dealership and he himself personally spent 5 hours with me showing me different options and to take even take a negative hit to make a customer happy and to get me into a completely different vehicle that fit within my budget, drive much differently than a Jeep Compass and all for $60 bucks more a month.  WOW!  

I have bought at least 10 cars in my life (Nissan, BMW, Cadillac, Mercedes, Lexus, Jeep and others)  and this was the absolute biggest waste of my time and most pathetic service I have every witnessed in my life of car buying!!  I hope the owner of Auto Nation Ford gets to read this, not that it will change my perception at all.

AUTO NATION FRISCO, TX.

1. Picked out a truck over the phone with Susan Kelly who told us it did indeed have 4X4.
Based on the info given by Susan, flew into Dallas to buy said truck.  A 2012 Ford F250 King Ranch model with 4x4.
2. Susan said she would have a cab pick me up at the Westin at 9am; the cab would be waiting.  Morning comes-no cab, no transportation to dealer.  No communication from Susan Kelly.
3. I called Susan, ""She forgot."".  Kelly said to call a cab & come out to dealership. Cab took me to Auto Nation Ford.  Auto Nation 
4. Met Kelly, she pulled up vehicle which read on computer 2 WHEEL DRIVE.  Whole reason for trip was for this truck which Kelly stated was 4X4 not 2 WHEEL Drive.
5. Kelly showed me a few other trucks.  Found one I liked.  Was told the price, but wanted the 2 year free warranty along with the 100,000 mile warranty.  Was told the 2 year warranty was only on Ford XLT models (before trip, called Don Chalmers Ford in Albuquerque & Brad Francis Ford in Los Lunas, NM who both said the warranty was on ALL SUPER DUTY TRUCKS which would include the one we were buying.
6. When I was told I could not have the warranty, I was leaving the dealership, Steve Roach, a sales-manager came over to me & said he would GIVE me the 2 year warranty.  I then agreed to the purchase of the final Ford truck I had picked out.
7. The Finance Manager neglected to tell me the agreed upon price was going to be raised by roughly $700 to accommodate my wish for the 2 year warranty package.  I questioned why the cost was on the contract & Steve Mattingly told me so that Ford would acknowledge that the truck had the warranty.  None of this was disclosed.
8. Called Steve Mattingly about 7 times-no return call until 5 days later.  Called Steve Roach probably 25 times, who said he would ""Fix & look at all the paperwork."" on Thursday, May 30, 2013 by noon.  No call-back.  Now 5pm.

64,"April 30, 2013","Experience started off decent,   
Day 1:  I inquired about vehicle (SVT Lightning) and since AutoNation Dealers share inventory and I could not make it to Frisco since I live west of Fort Worth, the saleswoman said she could bring the vehicle to me so she could be credited with the sale. So reluctantly I said okay hesitant to start a new dealership relationship. Since the listing was new and did not have any pictures, I inquired to see if they could send me some and they sent me one picture. I asked if they could send me more pictures and the saleswoman said she would send me more a little later in the day. I never received the pictures. So I contacted my AutoNation dealer that I worked with before that were top notch (AutoNation South Fort Worth - used to be Bankston on Bryant Irvin) to see if they could get me pictures, and they did same evening. So I had my salesman that I have an established relationship with contact the Frisco AutoNation store to get the vehicle transferred so I could take a test drive.

Day 2: Come to find out there were a couple of mechanics at the Frisco AutoNation that wanted the vehicle and they were not letting the vehicle be transferred. First time I have heard of a publicly listed vehicle not being offered to the public and being held by employees. A very dishonest and unethical business practice. I don't see the problem offering a vehicle to a mechanic, but don't list it publicly and hold on to it for the mechanics. Leave it off until the public can actually buy it.

Day 3: I continued to push the transfer (and so did my salesman, he even got his manager involved) and the Frisco store stated that the mechanics backed away because the truck needed $4K worth of repair and it was driven real hard. I still wanted the vehicle transferred so I could take a look at it and so the AutoNation of South Fort Worth Service Dept. Side note: The AutoNation South Fort Worth service guys are excellent, just got through working with them to repair electronics and oil leaks in my wife's car that was previously transferred from the Frisco store. The Frisco store service manager told my salesman that he could pick up the vehicle if I wanted it that bad, so I said yes, I still wanted to take a look and have the service people I trusted take a look too. 

Day 4: My salesman sends someone to pick this vehicle up early the next morning and they won't let her have it, they say that a deal has been written on it even though there was not a deal in their system the entire day from what my salesman advised. 

End of Day 4 early Day 5: The Frisco AutoNation sold the vehicle out from under me. Another dishonest and unethical business practice. 

The whole situation was real shady. The vehicle was wanted by mechanics, then not because it needed $4k worth of repair and was on the lift taken apart, to being sold 24 Hrs later after I was told this, with it still on the lift??? I am very mechanically inclined, I work on all my vehicles and others, so I know how long certain repairs take and how long dealerships usually take. This dealership has lost my business and my respect and I will make sure everyone I know that comes to me inquiring about vehicles (and there are many) to stay away from this dealership.  I am questioning whether I will ever buy a car from any AutoNation Dealer since they seem to have dealers that engage in dishonest and unethical behavior under their umbrella. 

The funny thing is that my wife's car I had transferred from this same dealership when I bought it in less than 24 hrs, thank God I bought a warranty because the car had some serious leaks that were covered up, I don't think the car went under any kind of inspection.

So to whoever reads this review, please think twice before engaging in business with the Frisco dealership, especially if you need a vehicle transferred to another AutoNation Dealer close to you, they are not in the business for the consumer.

72,"December 31, 2012","Took my 2011 F250 30,875 miles in for a front end wobble.  Robbie said it was probably the front end dampener.  This was on Friday at 1:00 pm.  On Monday they called me and said the dampener was bad and needed to be replaced but in order to do the job I NEEDED to pay for the alignment and the rotation.  What??  When I asked why, he couldn't provide me with a logical answer other than it needed to be done.  When he told me it was $149.99 for the alignment I told him I would take it elsewhere even though I had done all my servicing (oil changes, fuel filter, 30,000 mile service, and rotations/rebalances) done there.  When I told him it was ludicrous I needed to pay to have the warranty part installed correctly and that it should be covered as well he said if I didn't have the alignment done there the part going forward would NOT be warrantied.  So I called Ford Customer Service, what a waste of time.  Because these dealers are individually owned they don't have any jurisdiction over them.  Bottom line is, over $150 they lost my business for the life of my vehicle.  Steer clear of this dealer, no customer loyalty whatsoever.  The funny part is, they had no problems during all my previous services begging me for a five star rating if I received an online survey from Ford.  What a joke.  Even said they would give me a free interior and exterior detail if I did.  How about you just give me 5 star service and I'll pay for the detail??!!  Now there's a better idea.  Chose a different Ford Dealer if you own a Ford.  These arrogant people at Bankston aren't worth your time or frustration.  Guess that's the reason they have a 2 star rating out of 5.",1.3
73,"December 04, 2012","Overpriced financing, selling cars that have mechanical problems and pretend like u messed it up when u drove off the lot. these people here are definitely snakes looking to make a sale anyway possible. i will build my credit up and shop elsewhere when time to buy another vehicle.",1.0
74,"October 12, 2012",Bankston has furnished the cars for my church's annual raffle. I had lost confidence in North Central Ford. I was very pleased wiorking with Mark and Henry. Mark made sue that I got exactly what I wanted. I ordered it from factory. Henry explained the features of my new Escape. I would recomend Bankston Ford to anyone who wanted a Ford product.,5.0
75,"August 13, 2012","Don't EVER step foot near this place!  I had my car towed due to it quit running...they told me my cylinders were working at very low capacity and I would need a new engine due to a long term coolant leak. I have my car serviced every 3000 miles and never have I been told my coolant is low, nor did it overheat, no lights came on to indicate it being low,no engine line with problem codes and no running hot.  Took it to another Ford dealership and it was my catalytic converter!  Wasn't a real cheap fix, but much less than a new engine or buying a new car.  Stay away from this place, there are too many good Ford dealerships out there who are honest to take it to.",1.0
76,"June 09, 2012","I went in to buy a license plate holder for my Navigator and the parts guy (who was extrememly nice and professional)said, ""I would put that on for you since it takes a special rivot gun and a special rivot. But the gun I have is too big. So go ask the service department if they can do it for you"" So I walked over to the service desk about 30 feet away and asked the service manager if he could do this for me. His response was ""Well, did you buy the car here?"" As in, why would I want to do that? And I said no, but the parts manager said you might. So, the service manager frowned a little and said to one of the guys in the department, ""See if that guy in used cars can do it"". So I said thank you and gave them my keys. 

About 25 minutes later they came up with the license plate bracket holder attached. I thanked them profusely and had happy thoughts of writing a good review for them. That is until I got home and saw what they did. They did not use the special tool or the special rivets to put the holder on, they just drilled three holes in my plastic bumper and put in screws that when I tugged on the holder at home, fell off in my hands. 

You know what, my father worked for Ford for 30 years and I've never owned anything but a Ford car. But between this and how Lincoln treated me when the Navigator came off lease, I'll buy whatever makes me happiest this time. But even if that is a Ford, it won't be at Bankston.

77,"March 26, 2012","I brought my vehicle to Bankston Ford of Frisco for an issue with the sync system in my Ford F-150 and explained that the sync system goes out when I drive in the rain or if run through a car wash (obviously a short somewhere in the system) and drains the battery completely dead. All they did was reset the system, while this fixed the symptom it doesn't resolve the problem. I am very dissatisfied with this level of service from a dealer. Quote from the service page: --100% Customer Service Commitment Our Dealership is focused on one thing only…Your Complete Satisfaction. We are here to help you, and our Service Team is dedicated to Outstanding Customer Service!-- I did not receive the 100% customer service nor am I satisfied completely. ",1.8
78,"October 08, 2010",I was outright lied to by the service technician and they did not perform all of the services as described in the service report.  I am in the process of contacting Ford Motor Company with a formal dealer service complaint and I am also contemplating contacting a third party to conduct an investigation.,1.5
79,"November 26, 2009","My wife and I visited this dealership on a Monday afternoon at around 3pm. We arrived and began walking through the lot looking at the vehicles we were interested in. After about 10 minutes of looking and no salesperson, I finally went looking for someone. I approached the dealerships doors to find a salesperson, O'dell. He proceeded to help me and was very friendly. We ended up deciding on a vehicle that we liked and went inside to talk about the nitty gritty details. We finalized our negotiations and were going to close the deal, but they told us that they were having problems with their systems and told us that we could come back since it was so late and we had our daughter. Let me say that aside from us being there for roughly 6 hours and that we were going to have to return the next day to sign the papers, everyone was extremely helpful. The experience was good up to this point.

The next day I spoke with my uncle who advised me to visit another dealership to see if the deal I was getting at Bankston was the best deal I could get. I did that and found that another dealership was going to give me a better price. The Bankston dealership still had my trade-in, but the new dealership said they could just go get it for me the next day. I closed on the new truck and went home thinking everything was okay.

The next day I received a phone call from the general sales manager telling me congratulations on my purchase from the other dealership, but that they went ahead and changed the tires and brakes on my trade-in and that it was going to cost me $1,200. He wanted to know how I would like to take care of it since we had a verbal agreement and I was responsible for the charges, according to him. Keep in mind that at this point I have signed nothing, so they had no right to do anything to my trade-in until the deal was concluded. After speaking with the dealer that I ended up buying from, they told me that Bankston Ford had sent my trade-in to one of their Honda stores (my trade-in was a Honda) to be readied for re-sale. Grapevine Ford, the dealer that I actually purchased my truck from, said to not worry about it. that they would take care of this issue, which they did.

At this point I am extremely angry that Bankston Ford would try to pull something as shady as this. Because I wasn't going to buy from them, they were going to try to get SOME money out of me, whether it was legal or not. I will buy a Ford again, but I will NEVER buy anything from ANY Bankston dealership.",2.6
80,"May 23, 2009","I found Bankston Ford Frisco to be a very poor experience. It took over an hour for anyone to come out to the lot while I was there, they were standing in front of the door talking. I was the only customer that was there at the time as well (2:00 on a Friday afternoon). When Scott finally came out he was unhelpful, knowledgeable, border-line rude, and wasn't willing to even take me around to look at the vehicles. He stood in one place and pointed and wasn't willing to check if I was eligible for the Ford loyalty discount on the two Ford vehicles that I already own. I was very disappointed in my experience with this dealership and most notably Scott. I am looking to buy a vehicle within the next week and he was told that when he finally came out to ""help"" but that didn't matter to him. Never again will I step foot on Bankston Ford's campus because of this.",1.0
81,"April 16, 2009","I have been dealing with Bankston Ford of Frisco for a little over a year and have found them to one of the friendliest and professional dealerships that I have worked with.

There is no pressure from anyone at this dealership and they will do everything possible to make you the best deal they can.

He is open minded and will listen to your issues and will find the best solution to the issue at hand. Everyone at Bankston Ford of Frisco is very friendly, knowledgeable and helpful from the guy at the parts desk to the General Manager, Jason.  They will make you feel at home and make you want to come back again.  If you are looking for a new ford vehicle please take the time to stop by and see Carlos.  You will be glad you did.
