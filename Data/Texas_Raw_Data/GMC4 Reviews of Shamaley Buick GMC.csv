1,"July 01, 2015",I knew there was an issue with my enclave but another service department kept telling me nothing was wrong. I took my car to Shamaley and Kathryn Walker was so incredibly helpful and found the issue right away. She went out of her way to help me repair my vehicle and really listened to my requests. I will never trust my car to anyone else. ,5.0
2,"June 12, 2015","Sean Collins (Client Manager,Sales) really paid attention to what was important to us and what we liked. He gave us space to discuss things in private when we needed to. His customer service throughout the sale is the #1 reason we bought from Shamaley. Roberto Quezada (Finance Manager) made signing for the vehicle a breeze, he was very patient and was happy to answer all of our questions! Thank you all so much, service like this is hard to find these days!",5.0
3,"August 06, 2014","Do NOT go to Shamaley, Buick/GMC for anything, the worst customer service you will ever come across. My family and I have purchased 4 vehicles from this dealership in the past and we have now have vowed not to go back. The service department is horrible. I had multiple bad experience in the past. I had to take my 2012 Lacrosse in for service (under warrenty), but now I had to take my 2013 Acadia in for 2 recall and was treated even worse then before. 

It first started after I called Shamaley to verify that the recalls were for my Arcadia. They confirmed with use of VIN and told me it would take a month to get the parts in, 2 months later they called an said they have the parts in and it will take 2 days to do the repairs. We asked if they would provide a rental since the work would take 2 days to complete and I need my vehicle for work. They called me back and said NO to the rental but to have it in at 9 am to ensure that they would have enough time to finish the work in one day. 

The vehicle was dropped off at 8:30. I decided to call Shamaley after lunch around 1pm to check on the progress. My fist 3 calls went unanswered, during my forth call I was transferred then immediately hung up on me. (which really upset me) I called a fifth time and asked for a supervisor, at this time I was transferred to the service supervisor. I explain what happen with my previous 4 calls, in which he some what apologized for then asked what he can do, I then ask him for an update on my vehicle which he said it was just about done just waiting for them to wash it. I ask if it would be ready by 3 pm so I can go to work, he assured me that it will be done but to wait for a call confirming completion. Well 2:30 pm came along and no call, I thought that maybe they forgot to call since all it need was to be washed. I asked a family member for a ride to the dealership. When I walked into the service department there was no one there to help me so I walked to the casher and explain that I need to pick up my vehicle, she said I had to find a service advisor to help me (more aggravation), I told her that no one was there. She looked over the counter and saw for herself that no one was there. She then walked me over to the advisor desk and began looking for my keys. She found the keys with the invoice and handed them both to me. At this time the 1 of the 4 advisors came from a back to try to assist, but by this time I was already late for work and in a hurry. Later that day I look at the invoice carefully and noticed that Shamaley didn't even start work on my vehicle till 10:31 and finished at 15:23. They wasted 2 very important hours, they made me late for work, horrible phone etiquette, a child's car wash and poor customer service. I would rather drive to another GMC dealership on the other side of town or to Las Cruces, NM then go back to these clowns. DONT waste your valuable and precious time/money here!!!",1.4
