0,"April 15, 2020","Gilton did a great job listening and following-up.  His personality and friendliness gained him the deal.  He and the Sales Manager didn't play games.  They provided realistic numbers and offered a great deal very quickly.  In addition, Gilton went out of his way to deliver the new vehicle to our doorstep and complete the paperwork at our convenience to keep everyone safe during these trying times.  I was impressed with Gilton and this dealership.  I will do business with them again in the future.",5.0
1,"March 13, 2020","These people, particularly management, are very dishonest and untrustworthy. Con artist is the perfected word.  Insisting on selling a used car with mechanical issues and charging extra tax which is a scam. BRING YOUR OWN MECHANIC and make sure you check fine print before signing anything with these deceitful people!",1.0
2,"February 28, 2020","Gilton was wonderful to work with. He went above & beyond to make the sale and make sure that I was satisfied with the deal I was getting. When I inquired about the vehicle I got an email from two different sales associates at the dealership. I went with Gilton because he sent a video in his original email to me and I appreciated being able to put a face to the person I would potentially be buying a car from. If I was writing this review solely on Gilton it would be a 5/5. 

I’m giving a 3/5 stars for two reasons. First, we were purchasing this vehicle from out of town. We flew into Houston to pick up the vehicle and when we got there, we noticed a few blemishes that were not shown online. Very frustrating. They took a little off of the price to “satisfy” us but I still would have liked to have known about this prior to flying into Houston. Yes - we should have asked - but I also feel like those things should be stated online. It’s sneaky in my opinion. 
Second, I purchased the car mid February, I’ve had it for two weeks and I already need an oil change. It makes me wonder what other maintenance was looked over. I don’t feel like I should have to pay for an oil change two weeks after purchasing a CPO vehicle. 

Overall, I would recommend this dealership.. just make sure they change the oil on the vehicle. And ask for Gilton! ",3.0
3,"December 08, 2018",I found my Mazda CX-3 on the Russell and Smith Mazda website. I emailed the company and received and email from Gilton Huggett within minutes! I called him a few hours later and we set up an appointment for me to come in. I came in on a Saturday and he had everything ready for me to test drive. I loved it! I got a great deal on my trade in and was treated very kindly by multiple people. I was very pleased with Jason Lainez who was my finance manager. I didn’t feel pressured to do anything I didn’t want to. Gilton took the time to sit with me in my new car and explained everything before I left. I am very happy with my purchase and service. I came in and was very honest with them about what I needed/wanted and I was treated exceptionally. ,5.0
4,"September 27, 2018","Gilton Huggett made the vehicle buying process at Russell and Smith Mazda in Houston extremely smooth. I'm a single woman and was looking for a trustworthy certified pre-owned vehicle. He was able to work an incredible deal that I could afford - for a beautiful car with very few miles on it. He was extremely helpful, responsive, hardworking and personable. I feel very lucky to have found Mazda and Gilton!",5.0
5,"September 15, 2018","My wife and I decided on it's time to buy a SUV, after researching for couple of months on all the brands and going to multiple dealerships we've narrowed our list down to 2018 Mazda CX-5.  Then after talking to several Mazda dealerships all over Houston Area, Russell & Smith Mazda was the best in class.  They offer great incentives at the dealership as far as maintenance is concerned, one of the top dealerships that offers extra value after you buy your vehicle.  I actually talked to a lot of great sales rep at each dealership but something about Russel and Smith made us feel at ease.  On August 28th, 2018, we decided to take the leap and Gilton Huggett was our primary contact and he's been outstanding every step of the way.   Extremely knowledgeable and able to answer all our questions.  This was the smoothest car buying experience we've ever had.  Price was negotiated up front before we even came into the dealership, no hidden fees or hassle once at the dealership, really put us at ease.  I kept waiting for a catch, but there was none.  We were provided excellent customer service from both Gilton Huggett and Jad Jibin from the moment we walked in, we were explained everything and test drove the vehicle we were interested in.  Then how the vehicle works after purchasing it.  The CX-5 is phenomenal, i'm super satisfied with the purchase!  Not only does it look amazing, the plethora of features and drive is unreal.  Gilton answered all our questions and provided phenomenal customer service from the start to end.   Even after buying the vehicle, Gilton was still answering all our questions and giving us tips and tricks.  I love how the excellent customer service doesn't end with you leaving the door.  Finance department was great, no hidden fees and catches.  This was a super smooth car buying experience.  I'm going to recommend Russell & Smith Mazda to all my friends and family.  I'll definitely do business again with them that's for sure.  ",5.0

7,"August 06, 2018","I just moved from Japan where I didn't need a car. I was not sure about the car to choose. My friend recommended me Russell & Smith Mazda, because they have great service. I confirmed, I got great service. I talked with Gilton, and he solved all my concerns. He organized a pick-up for drive testing, advised me on my car insurance, he talked to my bank, and organized my car delivery. he also already schedule my car maintenance. If you are a newbie in cars like me, just ask for Gilton. He will help you!",5.0
8,"August 06, 2018","Just bought my 3rd Mazda from Russel & Smith Mazda. Great experiences with the manager, sales, and finance team all 3 times. The sales manager (David) was very easy to work with, and worked hard to help me reach my purchase price goal. My sales rep, Gilton Huggett, was very helpful, patient, has been with the company for more than 10 years, and is extremely knowledgeable about the vehicles they sell. After a short test drive of the incredible 2018 CX5, we came back to the shop and worked out a deal within 20 minutes. I truly appreciate both David's and Gilton's willingness to work with me. I even got a 0% interest loan! 

Over the last 10 years and 2 Mazdas, this dealership has provided excellent maintenance service for my vehicles, from the easy online booking system, to their friendly and helpful maintenance team, and great coupons that I regularly receive. Oh, they also wash and clean your car after each service.

9,"April 02, 2018","Excellent customer service and a wonderful experience! I have been to this dealership twice, their staff is friendly and courteous. They make you feel welcomed. 

I leased my car from Gilton Huggett in 2015 and now I am purchasing another car from him because he made my process very easy. He is helpful, knowledgeable, and patient. He will answer any questions you have and never rushes through the process. Russell & Smith takes good care of their customers and appreciate their business. The finance director. Jad, was also very helpful and went over everything thoroughly. 

I highly Recommend Gilton and will always give him and Russel & Smith Mazda my business without any hesitation.",5.0

11,"January 14, 2018","This was by far the best car buying experience my wife and I have ever had. Once we spotted a car that we were interested in, we sent an email. Our salesman, Gilton, wrote back minutes later. We were able to negotiate the price and they had the vehicle ready for us to look over and test drive when we came in. There were a couple of small things that needed to be addressed that should have been caught during the inspection. However, they immediately took it to the shop and had it taken care of right away. Since the price was already agreed upon, there were no upsells of any kind. They asked one time if we wanted an extended warranty. Of course we declined since that is what an emergency fund is for. The general manager, Steve Rodriguez, was amazing and has worked there over 20 years. Customer service and customer satisfaction are stressed from the moment you step foot onto the property until you leave with your new vehicle. We will definitely recommend anyone visit them for their next purchase. They have three dealerships: Mazda, Ford, and Honda. Go visit them today.",5.0
12,"January 01, 2018","I love Mazda! The quality of the cars and service is exceptional. At Russell and Smith Mazda they were quite attentive and willing to help. Gilton Huggett made the process comfortable and easy. Amma Sheikh, the Sales Manager, came out, introduced himself and said he was there to help with whatever I needed. Jad Jibin made the application process stress free. Overall, this was the best car purchasing experience I've ever had. I will refer whenever I can. Thank you so much Russell and Smith family.",5.0
13,"December 22, 2017","This place is awesome. They made everything easy. They were patient with me and very courteous.  I have been to several places looking to buy, and this was the only place that took the time to find something within my budget and didn't make me feel uneasy or wasting their time. I appreciate Salina and Jad for making this the best car buying experience I've ever had!!! Thank you both. It was a pleasure doing business with y'all. Definently would refer and I will be back.
Sincerely,

14,"December 17, 2017","My advisor, Steven Rodriguez, was fantastic as usual!  I was helped promptly when I arrived, received a loaner car in no time at all, and my car was ready quickly.  Steven made sure  was happy with the service, and even walked me to my car and opened the door for me when it was time to leave.  I'm not sure if this is Mazda culture or just Russell and Smith, but they have my business forever!",5.0
15,"December 12, 2017","We visited Russell & Smith after seeing good reviews online.  We were helped by Gilton Huggett and he was very knowledgeable and courteous during our visit.  We ended up purchasing a new CX-5 because we felt we were treated fairly and respectfully.  This dealership is much farther from our home in League City than the Clear Lake dealership, but we chose Russell & Smith because they apparently understand how to treat a customer.  Too bad it is not that way at all dealerships.",5.0
16,"December 03, 2017","I had the pleasure of being helped by Steve Rodriguez. He informed of every step the process was going to take. He called me to inform me that a part needed to be ordered and the work would be completed the next day - something he has already eluded to when I brought the car. Since he had planned for a replacement car during the repair, there was absolutely no inconvenience for me.
He also called me with some recommendation and qualified the criticality - for me to choose what I deemed to be important. Finally, my car was washed, I received a detailed document of the work done as well as the unit price of everything done.
I had a brief conversation with Ravi Sapkota to discuss the estimate foe resale which I intend to do shortly.
I am so impressed!.

17,"November 23, 2017","Excellent service as always! I am very satisfied. Even though i said that i would like to spend more to use my accumulated points, the Service Advisor Javier said that they will check first and see whether anything needs to be replaced. They found out that everything is still in a good shape and no additional replacement is needed and therefore, suggested that i would use my points for next service. This indicated true honesty. Thank you.",5.0
18,"September 03, 2017","Bought my CX5 from Russell & Smith Mazda. I was under the gun since my previous car had been totaled & my insurance coverage for rental car was running out. Steve Rodriguez treated me fairly and with respect. So far this is the only dealership in the city in which I, as a woman, have had a positive ineraction with all the staff, and especially Mr. Rodriguez. Even Finance was professional and not overly pushy. Highly recommend Russell & Smith Mazda. ",5.0
19,"September 03, 2017","Bought my Mazda CX5 here in September 2015 & its been serviced here exclusively since.

22,"April 24, 2017","Gilton was thorough and knowledgeable about the CX9, which we purchased.  He was fast and efficient throughout the process.  We began the process with a phone call and then did most of the preliminary work via email.  He was responsive and quick during the entire process.  As an aside, my husband purchased a car from Gilton 9 years prior.  It was comforting to work with a known commodity and someone who obviously cares about the product he sales and the customers he serves.  ",5.0
23,"March 02, 2017","My husband and I just bought two beautiful Mazda (a Mazda-3 and a Mazda-6 Grand Touring).  Gilton Hugget is our guy ! he is professional and so thorough in his explanations. When you deal with Gilton, you want to buy the entire dealership ! You can tell that he loves his job and it is not surprising that he is the number 1 as Mazda Sales Consultant !  Trey Bodwin is also exceptional ! He made the financial aspect of the deals absolutely painless. Stephen Rodriguez, the Sales Manager makes you feel at home and is also extremely helpful.

26,"May 31, 2016","I want to thank Jordan and Peter for helping us find a car for my 16 year daughter.  They are very professional, knowledgeable and willing to work with you to get the best deal in town.  Even though we purchased a different car somewhere else I would highly recommend them.  Unfortunately they did not have the color we wanted in stock or the deal would of been made.  This was my daughter's first new car and she was quite particular on the color she wanted.",5.0
27,"May 27, 2016","As I female senior citizen without anyone to help when I buy a car, I really appreciate Russell and Smith Mazda and their staff!  Probably more than I can express in this post.  I purchased my first car in 2009 from Gilton Huggett and called him in May 2016 when it was time to do a trade.  I gave Gilton my financial parameters and received a credit app via email within ten minutes so we were able to get the credit in place before I left the comfort of my home.  Within 90 minutes (after a courtesy call from Luis Ramirez with financing details meeting my needs), I was at the dealership finalizing all the paperwork with Finance Director, Edgar Williford—actually, a fun experience.  Everything was so easy and smooth, just like the first time with Gilton, who is a delight to work with.  Over the years, I have often told Nathan Nguyen, my Service Advisor, that not only do I love my Mazda but with his help, advice, and patience, plus the performance of the service staff—these are huge reasons I will continue buying and servicing my cars at Russell and Smith.  I actually enjoy the experience of buying a car with (and having it serviced by) these people!  They are thorough, patient, fun to interact with, and knowledgeable about their products and the process.  And that’s quite an endorsement from someone who used to get very anxious and insecure when entering a dealership.  I sooo appreciate them all!!!  Thanks again!!",5.0

Car buying experience from start to finish was outstanding. No pressure, excellent pricing, outstanding service throughout the sale.

31,"March 30, 2016","For a first time car purchaser I have a lot of worries and questions running in my mind, but the moment I walked in to this auto dealership I got excited. People were very friendly and courteous. They attended to your every need. Of course with special mention to Gilton Huggett who was our agent. He was very thorough with explaining things to us, very friendly and I just felt very comfortable talking with him discussing about the purchase. The guy who also took care of our purchase and financing part (Im sorry I forgot his name but I'll remember him if I see him.lol) was very kind, he also tried to get us the best deal out there and is very hard-working and of course the person who assisted us with the paperworks, Edgar Williford was just as friendly and thoughtful as anybody else. He walked us through the paperworks, suggested more feats that I could benefit from my new car and comfortable to hold a conversation as well. I would definitely recommend this dealership to anybody. As a first time car buyer, I had no regrets that I chose this dealership and was even lucky to have Mr. Gilton Huggett as our agent. To sum it all up, it was an excellent experience for me and of course I'm one happy buyer of the all new 2016 Mazda CX-5.",5.0
32,"March 25, 2016","I'm an extremely satisfied owner of a newly leased 2016 Mazda CX-5.  No questions asked, Gilton Huggett is the Client Services agent to see at Russell & Smith Mazda.  Gilton is splendidly courteous.  He was crisp in his communication, generous with his attention, and honest in his offering.  Without hyperbole, one of the most pleasant service experiences I had the privilege of enjoying in my lifetime--I'm so thankful to Gilton and the stellar team he works with at Russell & Smith Mazda.  They truly put into practice their core tenets of customer service.  Anyone who does business with them should count themselves as fortunate.  ",5.0
33,"March 13, 2016","I had an overall positive experience at Russell and Smith when the I purchased the CX-5 Touring. I worked with Gilton Huggett and he was professional, clear, and nice. We communicated often through email, which was is an efficient form of communication for me. I went to several dealers in the Houston area to get comparison prices. Russell and Smith quoted an excellent price for the CX-5; however, they wanted to add an excessive amount of dealership accessories to the total cost. Many other dealers have very few or no dealership accessories. They were willing to drop some of the add-ons, but not all, by the time we were finally done. On another note, Russell and Smith offered a very good price for my trade-in. It took a total of 3 hours to negotiate a price, finalize the loan paperwork, get the car, and go through the car tutorial. Gilton was fairly direct, friendly, and informative throughout this process. Another nice thing is that I didn't spend much time waiting for Gilton to communicate with a sales manager, it all happened relatively quickly and efficiently. Overall, I would say that I had a positive experience with Russell and Smith, despite some surprising dealer add-ons.",4.6

40,"December 28, 2015","A few years ago I was living in Philadelphia and in the market for a Mazda CX5. The dealership near me was so antiquated in how they treated me as a customer that I went elsewhere and got a different car. They were out of touch how much information is in the hands of customers these days and that some of us would rather not spend hours negotiating prices.

I am so impressed with Russel & Smith dealership. Everyone I dealt with was genuinely friendly and actively working to ensure a positive car buying experience. They were reasonable about prices - on both a new car and my trade in - without having to go back and forth a bunch of times. When the car I wanted was not immediately available they went the extra step of finding it fast. I would definitely buy a future car from them. I am so glad I gave Mazda a second chance.",5.0

After deciding to purchase the car, we worked with Edgar Williford to complete the paperwork.  I think Edgar could talk to anyone about anything!  He and my husband talked about old cars for a bit but then he moved us through the signing of all the documents.

Gilton then escorted us out to the car, took pics for us and spent several minutes reviewing everything inside the car once again.  We both were very pleased with the service from Gilton and Edgar.  I'm really excited to have a new car as the one I was driving is 13 years & 3 months old!  ",5.0

Not only is this an inconvenience for me, to come on my lunch hour and be pressed for time, it is very unprofessional that as a dealership you forgot to do something, and I have to re arrange my schedule to get it completed. I understand at times, things happen and can be forgotten but if it was so important to be done, I would have appreciated the dealership having it completed before I drove my car off the lot!

62,"September 10, 2015","Went in tonight to work out a deal we had discussed on the phone to meet a super friendly salesman and sales manager. The car was already pulled up and we were on the test drive within 10 mins of arriving. Once we got back I asked them to go ahead and appriase our trade while we looked around next door. Got back in and the ""negotiations"" weer underway. They low-balled me on the trade but I showed them NADA values and we met at a middle ground. Lower than I truly wanted but they gave me a decent discount on the 2016 we came in to look at. Once we agreed on a trade number they asked if we had a deal, and I said yes. They went to work up the hard numbers on paper for me to sign off on the deal and that's where things went downhill.

The $2000 discount was all of a sudden less that $500 because of the ""adders"" the car had. I said this was not the price I agreed to so unless they honor the number they told me on the sales prices, no deal. They literally said ""that's  what dealers do unless you ask for a drive-out number"".  So guess what....I drove out! Asked for my keys back and said have a nice night.  I wouldn't recommend them to anyone.


Update...the owner, Chase Smith, called me this morning after reading my reviews to apologize and make things right. They made me another offer on the vehicle and increased the trade value to make up some of the difference. The issue above should not have happened in the first place but they have tried to rectify the situation. Thank you Chase.",4.2
63,"August 31, 2015","I have to say this was one of the best car buying experiences I have ever had and I been through three (3) car buying experiences in the last 4 years. I helped my mom, and two brothers negotiate their car price, from Kia, Ford, and Lexus. First of all Russell and Smith Mazda customer service is top notch and world-class customer service. I emailed five (5) different Mazda dealerships in Houston on Thursday, August 27th and the first to respond was Gilton from Russell and Smith Mazda. I emailed Mr. Gilton back informing him to send me a quote without using their incentives. He then emailed me 15 minutes later with a price well below MSRP which I then replied back to schedule a test drive that same day. Fast forward, I get to the dealership at 4:45PM and there I met with Luis. Luis is the salesperson who I had a test drive with (Gilton and Luis work as a team). I told Mr. Luis that I am cross shopping with Honda, Acura, and Mazda. During the test drive, Mr. Luis educated me on the Mazda brand and then showed me what the 2016 Mazda 6 GT w/tech had to offer. I’m convinced now, I’m ready to buy this car right now! The test drive is over; we go in sit down and talk pricing. Mr. Luis told me this is the best they can do since their quote is way below MSRP and less than any other Mazda dealership (which was true). I tried to haggle a little more off and this is when Mr. Luis brings his manager, Mr. Steve Rodriguez. Mr. Rodriguez and I hit off very well; he was very professional and cared about the product they sold. He and I chatted about Mazda’s history and I’m pretty sure he was shocked I knew Mazda’s history even though this was going to be the first Mazda ever in the family. We then chatted about the price and since we clicked, he took a little off and I then agreed to the price. Basically, the experience was a no haggle experience. The price was excellent and below what others were paying. We are waiting for the finance manager since we are financing through Mazda. My wife and I are called in to the finance office and here we met Edgar. Mr. Edgar goes over the pricing, rate, and extended warranties. Mr. Edgar, was very professional and we chatted a long while about my wife and I jobs. He loves us, and goes out of his way to give us the best service. We are done signing papers and it probably took about 30 minutes. I have to pick up the car the next day because the tint person has already clocked out, no problem. My wife and I get there Friday and there is Mr. Gilton, who is ready to educate us on the vehicle and all the cool tech stuff in the car. During this time, he was very courteous and very well educate about this car. He showed us the ins and outs, which was very high tech! He also gave us a tour of the service department, explained to us how to make service appointments, and introduced us to the service advisors. We are done. I finally get to drive our new car home! Monday comes and checked my emails and I see one (1) email from another dealer (finally) their price was only $1000 off the MSRP, no thanks. The other dealers have not emailed me yet, their lost.

64,"August 15, 2015","We were all set to buy a new 2016 CX-5 from a different dealership (Jeff Haas) until they tried to stick one to us with 180 miles on the odometer!  Then I called Gilton at Russell & Smith - my second choice.  This turned out to be the best choice for our new car.  Gilton took us on a test drive which covered all sorts of road conditions which allowed me to experience a full range of the CX-5's capabilities.  This may seem a trivial thing, but no other dealerships have ever given me the opportunity to test drive a new car in such a thorough way.  

Dealing with Gilton and Ravi the sales mgr. was a better experience also, compared to other dealerships.  Due to our circumstances, Ravi told Gilton to deliver our new car to our home in Fulshear.  Now we were pleasantly surprised that they'd do that.  The next morning Gilton and a porter arrived with our new car as promised.  He fixed a minor issue and then went over all the operations of the bells and whistles....  Overall, a very good experience.  I'd recommend Gilton and Russel & Smith Mazda to anyone.  Oh, by the way, the CX-5 is everything other owners have raved about.  It's an excellent vehicle in its class.  Very fun to drive with precise steering, cornering, and plenty of oomph.  It's our first Mazda, and won't be our last.  ",4.8
65,"August 11, 2015","These guys from the top to bottom are clowns.  Emailed the GM- Steve Rodriguez – after he kept blasting me with ridiculous spam email.  Told him I wasn’t interested unless I had a human being talk to me instead of robospam.  Then he replied once and after I asked him if he had any pre owned Miatas he lied to me and tried to get me to come into this dealership.  I had seen this dealership selling used Miatas on Craiglist so why lie to me?  Just to sell me a new car?  How desperate are these guys?  I guess a lot since they have 1 star rating on Yelp.  With 4 other Mazda dealerships in the area why would you not treat a customer with respect and politeness?  Why lie?  Seriously, why lie about this?  I’m buying a Miata soon; I like the new look but probably not from these guys.  I believe in a long-term relationship not a short one but I guess RSM and I don’t see things the same way.  Was hoping to create a nice long term relationship as this would be my second Mazda and my 5th Japanese car.  I guess that’s not possible with these guys.  ",1.0
66,"August 10, 2015","This is our second time buying a new vehicle from Russell & Smith. The first time was in 2008. Otto, our salesperson this time, was great -- no pressure, very easy-going and relaxed style, knowledgeable, helpful, and answered all our questions to our satisfaction. The price negotiation was easy and fast. We'd researched costs via KBB, and knew how much we wanted to pay. Otto and his manager worked it out while we went to lunch, and offered us an unbeatable deal - our price, at 0% interest financing, and a customer loyalty discount of $500. We also liked that there was no pressure for us to purchase additional options during the finance phase. The options were presented, and we discussed pros and cons and made our decision without any pressure or undue influence. Russell & Smith is the best dealership we've worked with, hands down (we'd visited 3 other dealers during this process, as we were considering different makes of vehicles).

Gilton was just superb and patient with my questions and explained the complexities of the car with ease and simplicity. He even recommended us to get the insurance  online, hassle free, and far much cheaper from Geico when he overheard the frustrating  conversation we had with our regular insurer.

80,"September 19, 2014","AVOID THIS DEALERSHIP AT ALL COSTS!! They are your classic crooked, say whatever it takes to make the sale, dishonest dealership. 

I received a letter in the mail from Russell and Smith Mazda stating that they wanted to purchase my vehicle...a 2012 Mazda 6...at a very specific price. How they got my information which included my name, address, type of vehicle, year, and even VIN I have no idea. They then called me twice in the same afternoon begging for me to come have my car appraised, saying that the demand for used Mazdas was really high and that the price they quoted me for my car was just an average figure and that I could and probably would receive more. I begrudgingly decided to make an appointment later that afternoon at 5. When I showed up just hours after scheduling my appointment I find out that the salesman...Alejandro...wasn't there. Turns out that showing up to an appointment he asked for wasn't really that important.

Another salesman then appears and starts the appraisal process. Turns out that the figure they quoted me was a boldfaced lie and I wasn't going to receive nearly that amount. The price they quoted was the maximum amount you could receive in a trade in if your car was a brand new, high end Mazda 6. They failed to mention this on the paper they mailed and on the phone when I called before I arrived. Essentially this dealership will lie and say whatever it takes in the hopes that once you arrive they will trick you into buying a vehicle. 

Here's the kicker. As I was leaving the dealership a group of 2 other guys approached me and said they had received a similar letter!! Apparently this is a scam they pull on a lot of people to get them to visit.   

I can only blame myself and I should of known better, but who would think that a dealership would lie so blatantly? I originally purchased my vehicle at Jeff Haas Mazda and I have had nothing but positive experiences from them.  ",1.2

When I told him that it was the wrong color, he didn't acknowledge my comment and tried to push all the colors he had in the lot. He had lied about having the one I wanted, and refused to listen when I said I would only buy the color and spec I wanted. I told him how disappointed I was that he had lied and wasted my time. He ignored my comment and didn't apologize.

I made calls to other dealerships while he made me sit at his desk and wait, who knows what for. I was on my cell phone and he kept trying to interrupt, insisting that I take another color. Some other dealer was able to secure what I needed, and I left. 

The following day, he got word that he would receive a unit in the color I wanted. He texted and emailed me. I told him I had already purchased what I wanted from another dealer. He suggested that his competitors were either lying or manipulating me because in his view it would be impossible for anyone to secure what I wanted in such short time. Over the next 24 hours I received multiple emails and texts from him. I stopped responding.  Then he sent a text at 8:30PM and another the next morning at 7:00AM asking for confirmation that I had taken delivery of my car from his competitor. He also asked me to recommend him to friends and offered $100 on every referral sale. He even sent me a LinkedIn request! Eventually I asked him to stop contacting me.

115,"November 21, 2013","Went b for a test drive, then bought a car the next week.  I had communicated that I wanted a specific model and brand and that we could get together on Wed, when the sales person wasn't going to be in the office for Mon & Tues.  I got there on Wed, but he didn't have the car I had asked about.  He had to get it from another dealership AFTER we negotiated the price.  That added nearly 2 hours to the time. I was there from 11:30am-5:00pm - tough day for both of us.'

The Sales Mgr (Gen Mgr), Steve, never interacted with us, which I thought was strange.  I introduced myself to him after having met him the week before.  He was nice, but didn't really act like he was interested in supporting Ravi's sales effort.  Ravi had to go to another dealership (Deeter Mazda) to get my car.  Steve finally came in at one point and said that Ravi had just called and that he was 10-15 minutes out.  I do not mean to be negative about Steve; only an observation, as I watched other managers get REALLY involved with their salespeople.  It felt like Ravi was left on an island, in my opinion.

Ravi was GREAT.  He was very involved in making sure I had all of my questions answered and I felt like he worked with me on my pricing.  His explanation of ALL of the functions of the car were amazing.  There are so many that I am quite sure that I will have to spend a while studying the manual.  But he made it seem so easy.

i was surprised that the car that I had asked about wasn't there, and that it took 2 hours to get it.  That made the sales experience a little longer than I had expected, but i also understand that you aren't going to get a car from another dealership unless you are sure you are going to sell it.  Ravi did his best, in that respect.

Overall, it was a good, if long, experience and I applaud Ravi for his patience and salesmanship.

i would definitely buy a car from him again.

At least 4 other dealers did too, but there was something different about Sutoyo's as it seemed like a real sincere reply. We test drove a CX-5 and Mazada3 5-door and preferred the CX-5, even over the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4. Sutoyo pledged to get a vehicle for us within a few days. When we decided (a day later) all business was conducted through email in a very quick and responsive manner. We had a great quote on the purchase and drive out price at another dealer, which I sent to Sutoyo. He beat the price significantly. Timeline was test drive on Thursday, quote via email on Friday, car delivered on Monday. It was the precise color, trim level, and had the Bose/moonroof option, which is what we wanted to purchase. I honestly thought that the price was so low because of some catch for hidden charges when we went in for financing. Nope it was all legitimate. In fact, the finance manager, Edgar, was able to get us 0.9% APR for 60 months. We were not pressured to purchase extra warranties or any other options.

Finally before leaving the dealer to make up my mind, Ibrahim was polite and not too insistent or pushy. I returned back and after I took my time deciding what I wanted sat down to negotiate a deal. I had read horror stories elsewhere of aggressive dealers at japanese car dealerships. I had personally witnessed the demeaning manner in which Nissan dealers had treated my friend when he sat down for negotiation. I braced myself for such a treatment but my experience here turned out to be a very pleasant one. Very little negotiation before I was allowed to go in to meet the finance manager Edgar. Before I went in the price was brought down to the mutual satisfaction of Ibrahim and me.

The experience I had inside was a completely different one than I had anticipated. I personally witnessed painstaking, acrimonious, bitter haggling with the finance department guy in Nissan dealership who literally undid whatever negotiation had taken place at the dealers table by playing with the APR. Edgar was completely different he gave me the best APR and that too in 5 mins. No negotiation whatsoever, no changing the numbers that Ibrahim had given me. He presented a few packages that the dealership offered and when I politely refused them Edgar struck them off, no haggling, no pushing, no carrot dangling, none of the threatening demeanor I had personally witnessed at other Nissan dealerships. He further reduced the APR he was offering me when I insisted I deserve a better deal. Overall one of the most pleasant experiences ever. This was the first car I bought in my life, it is a pleasant experience for me. That is all anybody wants, the entire deal to be fair and a pleasant experience.

169,"August 11, 2013","My mother and I initially came to this dealership expecting a simple test drive and a simple negotiation before leaving empty handed. We had initially only wanted to test drive the Mazda 3 and see how it stacks up to the civic. Mr. Abdellatif, who was very friendly from get go, did a very nice and thorough job explaining and demonstrating how the vehicle  worked. One thing in particular stood out to me was when I complained that the steering felt a little tight. Mr. Abdellatif demonstrated to me that the tightness in the steering wheel was the result of a state of an art safety system so that the car does not go veering off course when I change lanes. Overall I felt during the test drive he was very helpful and explained the features of the car very well. Then when it came to negotiating the price, I was surprised by how straight forward he was. Instead of leading us on an dull rehearsed explaination of  cost, taxes, and destination fees, he straight out asked for what we were willing to offer. Also throughout the process he was very patient. English  is not my Mom's first language, so there were times when the same thing was needed to be explained many times before she understood. Mr. Abdellatif did not appear to be irritated by this and would carefully explain each thing over again. Overall I felt the Mr. Adbdellatif truly wanted us to feel welcomed and help us negotiate the price we wanted. We are now very happy with the Mazda 3 that we purchased.",5.0

Since I bought 2 cars this time, the new CX-5 and Mazda 6, I expect to be treated with much courtesy and respect, I received stellar treatment from Sutoyo and the GM Steve. I am a hard bargainer, while other dealers in town turn down my offers and low ball my trade-ins, Sutoyo and Steve (GM) worked with me to get the best deal for the cars and my trade-ins. We finished at nearly 11:00 pm on Saturday night, and the GM stayed behind to shake our hands and congratulate us on our new purchases. We really appreciate the effort and felt really good with our decision to purchase here. I will definitely recommend colleagues and friends to purchase their next Mazda at Russell and Smith, and especially with Sutoyo. He really deserve a praise for his effort and attitude.

You always hear stories about salesmen haggling you and taking advantage but my experience at Russell & Smith Mazda was totally different. I called a week in advance and set an appointment with Sutoyo Sugiharto. The awesome customer service began right at the start of our phone call! He called and confirmed my appointment the day before with a text and email. Talk about convenient and definitely meeting my needs. When we arrived, he already had options available to show and I was very pleased. I had an eye on one of the cars but I didn't want to purchase the first car I looked at, so I continued my search at a few different dealerships. BAD IDEA! Starting off at R&S Mazda really set the level of service at the highest degree. I visited three other dealerships in the area and the service was horrible. I was pushed around, haggled and given to multiple salespeople, it was a horrible experience. While I was out searching, Sutoyo texted me about a used Honda Accord that had just arrived. Talk about a deal I just couldn't resist. I decided to stop looking and head right back to R&S Mazda. It was the best decision I could make and their customer service doesn't stop after you sign on the dotted line either. Today I went to pick up my tags and registration, not only did they put the tags on for me but they also washed and vacuum my car. I couldn't be more pleased with Russell & Smith Mazda. My bf lease will be up in May and we will definitely be returning to R&S Mazda. Oh and did I mention their Service Dept. is amazing too? Nathan Nguyen always helps us there and the team is great!

216,"March 28, 2013","I had been looking to purchase a new vehicle in the small SUV category and had test driven several, including the Mazda CX-5, on the west side of town. After my first round of test drives, I narrowed it down the Mazda CX-5 and the Honda CR-V, and I wanted to get my wife's opinion on the two vehicles, so we went to Russell & Smith Mazda and Honda dealerships because they was closer to our house. My dealership experience at Russell & Smith was completely different from the dealerships I had visited on the west side, where the salesmen were pushy and kept calling me to get me to come in to buy. I stopped answering my phone for a few days, because I was so annoyed with the constant calls. When we first walked into Russell & Smith Mazda we were greeted by Sales Director Ben Bennani. He asked how he could help us and I told him we were interested in taking a CX-5 for a test drive. He arranged for Ravi Sapkota to go with us on the test drive. While Ravi was getting the CX-5 ready, Ben asked us what other vehicles we were interested in and I told him that I was between the CX-5 and the CR-V. He proceeded to show me a few things on the CX-5 floor model that the CX-5 and CR-V had in common, which was a refreshing change from the typical bashing of other brands. Ravi then took my wife and I on a test drive and was very personable and very knowledgable of the vehicle. I learned several things that I hadn't learned on my previous test-drive at Jeff Haas Mazda where the salesman just wanted me to ""feel the car"". When the test drive was finished, Ravi respected the fact that I was not ready to buy that night and did not pressure me at all. I asked for his business card and my wife and I headed to the Honda dealership. Don't get me wrong, we had an amazing experience at Russell & Smith Honda too, I just ended up liking the CX-5 better. However, I believe this speaks volumes to the Russell & Smith brand's practices and policies. Both dealership experiences were by far the best I've had. When I returned to Russell & Smith Mazda to buy, Ravi and the rest of the Russell & Smith Mazda team made the process very easy, fair, and straightforward. While the paperwork was being processed, Ravi made sure my new car was detailed, helped me clean out my old vehicle, showed me the service center, and walked me through parts of the owner's manual for my new CX-5. As an added bonus, when I returned the next day to pick up some accessories I had purchased for the CX-5, Ravi helped me install them in my new car. The whole process from first walking in the door, to working with Ben, Ravi, and then Roberto in financing, was completely centered on my wants and needs as a customer and I really appreciated that.

237,"October 30, 2012","I went in on a friday evening to purchase a car and i ended up purchasing a mazda 3.  unfortunately the following morning i found out that i was layed off from my job and could no longer afford the car so i went back to return the car the next day and jose told me there was nothing he could do that day because there was no way he could get ahold of the financing company untill monday morning.  he told me if the money has already been funded then i couldnt return the vehicle i could only go down to a lesser car and get SOME of my money back but i would still have to purchase a car.  he said he would call be before 930 on monday morning to let me know what the finance company had said.  on monday morning i called the finance company myself and they said that they have not received any documents yet and that they have not funded the car, but when jose called be at 9:25am (he did call me before 930 and i believe this is the only honest thing he told me) he told me that they have already received the money and that i couldnt return the car but he could lower my down payment but that just raised my monthly payment, or he could get me into a used car but still i would have to purchase a vehicle.  i explained to him that i had already called the finance company myself and that they said they have not sent the money and that i was confused to which he replied that the people he deal with at the finance company are an internal group they deal with and that the people i spoke with wouldnt have the correct information.  when i hung up with him i called the finance company again and they once again stated that they have not funded the car because they have not received the documents and that they cant fund a vehicle untill they receive that.  so i called jose back and explained to him again what the finance company told me and he said i wouldnt lie to you.  he was like im trying to work with you so you can get some money back. at this point i could sense he was getting irritated with me.  i told him that i dont understand how he is telling me one thing but the finance company themselves are telling me something else to which he replied ""look ill just get to the bottom line, i have been trying to work with you and i feel like you think that im not being honest with you, so you can return the car if you want and we might be able to get you some money back minus some fees but its going to show up as a reposscession on your credit  report.""  this didnt make sense to me either beings im returning the car myself and no one is coming and taking the car away from me but i figured it would be my best option.before i could even get to the dealership he called me back and said i spoke with the finance company again and they want to know who you spoke with so they can address the issue with them.  i was offended because i felt as if he thought i was lying to him and that it was an intimidation method on his part.  so i took the car back to the dealership and when i walked in to hand the keys to jose he told me that his people ""upstairs"" had also verified that the car has been funded and that he would make some phone calls and see what he could do but if the finance company and the people ""upstairs"" verify again that everything was finalized that he would call me and tell me that the car was mine and then he would drive it to my place of residence and park it and then mail me the keys and that i would just have to let it get repossessed.  i said i dont understand how it could have been funded so fast and he told me that they receive the money within 15 to 20 minutes because the money is electronically funded now adays. but this is completely different from what he told me earlier on the phone.  i was upset at this point because i am getting two different stories and i feel like someone is being dishonest with me.  when i get home i do some research and find that the dealership is privately owned and i get in touch with the secretary of the ownders office. the secretary maggie was very pleasant and explained to me that the vice president of the company mark (i forget his last name) was there and i could speak with him but that he was in a meeting at the moment but i could leave my contact information and he would get back with me shortly.  so i left my contact information and mark called me back in a very reasonable amount of time which i greatly appreciated!!  Mark was great!  i explained to him the situation i was in and what jose was telling me and that i wasnt happy with the service i was receiving from jose.  mark, the vice president of the company, even said that deals dont happen that fast and he was very sympathetic to my situation and said that he would call jose and tell him to return my down payment.  I greatly appreciate mark's compassion to my situation but was really upset that jose, the general manager of the dealship, had been so dishonest with me, especially since jose said that he wouldnt lie to me and that he would work with me.  Jose called me about 30 minutes later and said that HE just spoke with his boss and that he would have a check ready for me.  im not usually one to complain but the amount of dishonesty i received from the general manager at mazda was appalling.  i thought jose really was looking at my best interest and was trying to work with me.  i was going to send my roommate to see him because he is in the market for a new car but my roommate changed his mind after witnessing my experience first hand.  i was evening going to go back and purchase the mazda 3 after i found new employment but now i dont want that dealership to have my money.  i would say i would never go to russell and smith dealership again but i did have a great experience with the vice president mark and will definitely consider purchasing a car from one of their other dealerships in the future, just not the mazda location......well as long as jose is still working there.  a business should be ran with honesty and integrity and i dont feel like jose represents those qualities.  but the owners definitely seem like stand up gentleman and i appreciate their courtesy and compassion in this situation.

In reality it was the perfect fit that is why we went to Mazda first.  Mr Sugiharto was able to answer all our questions about the vehicle.  We are both accountants with good credit scores so we knew where we needed to be financially and they were more than fair with the price on the vehicle.  We were very happy.

Had already discussed with salesman accessories wanted and vehicle was approximately $600 off ticket price according to internet.  Only asked for 2 accessories which was discussed verbally and through e-mails before my flight.  This car was not discounted much off of the ticket price yet was still charged $495 for accessories which were not available there and had to be ordered.  I was told it would take 5 to 7 business days for delivery.  2 weeks later contacted dealership and was told would be checked on.  Parts dept. called me a week later (now 3 weeks total) telling me they were in their dealership.  I live in Louisiana which is where they were suppose to be shipped.  They were shipped 1 week later and finally arrived 1 month after ordering.  I was under the impression with salesman that I was also getting the rear utility tray which I had also ordered at the same time with car mats.  2 items:  Car mats and rear utility tray which I was charged $495 for.  Accessories! Then I was told that I didn't order the rear tray.  There are e-mails and of course eye to eye conversations that those were the only 2 items i had ordered.  The salesman said his supervisor would be contacting me concerning this matter.  I have never heard from anyone to this day and do not care to. I researched many vehicles and had decided on this model.  Had previously owned a Mazda 3 for our daughter but had bought locally.  Will never EVER buy a car out of state again!!! Paid for a 2 year inspection in Texas which I of course had to change to LA as soon as I received tag.  Did receive a $3 refund but was an additional expense not necessary.

T then suggested to them that they swap a wheel from one of the new cars on the lot and replace it with the wheel that was on order.  They agreed and I was able to get my car repaired and continue my trip. The dealership did quite a bit of work to check out my tire and TPMS sensor and put my wheel and tire back on the car and so I was expecting a hefty labor cost.

As Gilton was done with his client he took over, to show us around the cars, I asked where the other guy was and he said "" NOT TO BE COCKY BUT I AM THE MOST KNOWLEDEABLE SALES PERSON ON THE FLOOR"". okkk... sat down to talk bout the packages on what the S Grand Touring Mazda 3 hatchback came with standard, he listed so and so and then i asked isn't the keyless entry/starter standard he said "" No it is an option"" but as we saw on the paper it was listed under STANDARD , his lame excuse was "" ran out of space in the option section"" after arguing for awhile about the ""tech option"" i was a bit fraustrated. so the manager came out and asked me to test drive the graphite S grand touring in the show room, 
drive was nice, but whenever a big bump came along the back would have a creek, as we came back i asked the manager with the creek what better deal can you give, he said deal stands, creek is a easy fix its cause its been sitting in the show room , just needs to be lubricated.

I told Kingsley no problem. He then asked when I could come in, I said Friday.  I came in Friday to close the deal and Jose then told me the price was $13,900 plus t,t, and l.

I was told I can take advantage of the incentives in the future.  I'm not sure I'll do business here again as I feel honesty is very important.  I don't feel I received any special treatment that another dealership wouldn't offer.  My mom purchased a car here 2 years ago and referred me due to her experience w/ salesman Sutoyo Sugiharto.  I can say Sutoyo was very pleasant to work with.  I have a hard time believing employees were not aware that a large organization such as MD Anderson Cancer Center made an agreement w/ Russell and Smith to offer employees who purchase vehicles here incentives that were agreed upon.  A 10% discount makes a difference.  I will accept responsibility for not doing my research prior to purchasing the vehicle.

My husband has an infinity and they have never treat me so terrible on top of that if my car is broken or they have to service it you will get a loaner.

268,"November 16, 2011","To be fair to Russell & Smith, nearly every experience I have had with my Mazda has made me regret ever purchasing anything other than the other import make I previously favored.  That said, this complaint is exclusively regarding Russell & Smith.  I take my 2010 Mazda 3 GT to Russell & Smith for the routine maintenance.  I get friendly reminder emails when it's time to start thinking about scheduling and I get the car into the dealership on or near the appropriate 5,000 mile mark.  In September of 2011 - around the 20,000 mark - I took my car for the routine maintenance (oil, tires, fluid, etc.).  The report was that everything was in ""Good"" condition.  As far as tires, this mean that MORE THAN 50% of the wear was remaining.  This is consistent with what I was told when I purchased the car - that the tires were good for 50,000 miles.  It is now November 2011, I took my car for service (25,000 mile routine maintenance) this morning and was told I need FOUR NEW TIRES.  When I mentioned to Alfred - who did not know the rating for the tires - that (1) the tires were supposed to be good for 50,000 miles per the Mazda dealership's own representations and (2) that two and a half months and 5,000 miles ago they told me that I had 50%+ wear left on the tires, the best response Alfred could give was, ""Well, that's not good.""  Really?!  Not good huh?  I obviously did not come to that conclusion already before mentioning those two rather pertinent facts!  Alfred then suggested several filters to be replaced and flushing all of my fluids, etc.  At least when I take my car and purchase tires elsewhere, the new ones will not be part of the disaster that is the Mazda experience.  At least local tire shops honor their tire warranties and know how long they should last.  Avoid this dealership for routine maintenance.  Avoid Mazda for vehicle purchases if you can!",2.4

In fact, the saleperson stated to please ask any and all questions. There are no stupid questions or too many questions. In the end, we were presented with a fair deal that we accepted. While I waited for the temporary tags to be placed on the car, I stopped by the parts department to check on a second key and remote acccess fob. The young man behind the counter was very helpful. He printed out a diagram of the key and fob, wrote down the prices,including the labor to program the new key. As I was dropping the top down on my Miate before I left the dealership, Sutoyo, another sales representative, stopped and talked to me about my car and congratulated me on the purchase. I did not see one unhappy or disgruntled worked in the dealership.

Unfortunately, great customer service seems to be a fading service not offerred by more and more businesses. Russell and Smith Mazda, however, still beleives in the importance of treating their customers well. I will recommend this dealership to family and friends.

285,"September 18, 2011","On 8/13/2011 my wife and I visited Russell & Smith Mazda in Houston.  We weren't totally committed to buying a new vehicle but were open to the possibility if we found a CX-9 and a price that appealed to us.  I asked for Delroy Worrell as we entered the dealership (based on recommendation by Jerry Reynolds, the Car Pro along with numerous online reviews of the dealership).  Delroy made us feel comfortable and turned us over to William Hopkins, the salesman who worked with us for the remainder of our time at the dealership.  

I explained to both Delroy and William  that we hated buying cars.  For one thing, we always pay off our cars and keep them for a long time (current car was a 2001 Maxima).  And more importantly, I hate the car-buying process (high-pressure, back-and-forth to the manager to review the deal, etc.)  I don't think we have ever really left a dealership with a car without thinking that we left money on the table.  I am sure this is a common story that they hear.  The difference this time was that I was prepared at anytime to walk away from the dealership because I in today's economic climate I know dealerships are making good deals.

Another factor in this equation is that in the past we have always had to ""settle"" for a car we could afford instead of getting one with as many options as we wanted.  It is not that ""money was no object"" but at this point in our life, my wife and I were looking for a vehicle that we can take into retirement in a couple of years.  We were willing to spend a little more in order to avoid just settling for a vehicle that wasn't what we really wanted.

We were interested in a white CX-9 with leather interior but did not want the cream colored leather so William showed us a silver Grand Touring CX-9 with black leather interior, Bose entertainment system, backup camera, moon roof, etc.  It had way more options than we have ever had on a vehicle.  We test drove it and found that we really liked it.  My wife liked it enough to be serious about buying it if we could get a fair price.

We drove back to the dealership to start what I have always considered the most aggravating part of the car-buying process, the negotiations.  William presented a price to us that was more than we wanted to pay.  I presented a price to William based on information from Edmonds.com regarding the average selling price of that vehicle in that zip code area.  William took my information to Delroy and a few minutes later both returned and we negotiated a final price that was very close to my original offer.

My wife and I were happy with the transaction.  We got 0% interest with some incentive cash to sweeten the deal.  No high pressure tactics either during the sale or during the meeting with the finance person.

When I returned later in the day to pickup the CX-9, William met me and presented me with the keys and placed the temp tag on the vehicle.  I was pleasantly surprised to find the CX-9 had a full tank of gas.  I don't know if this is common practice with other dealerships but William said it was their practice.  (Remember it has been over 10 years since we bought a car.)

We are driving a 2011 Mazda CX-9 today because of the pleasant experience with William and Delroy at Russell & Smith Mazda.  I would gladly recommend Russell & Smith Mazda to anyone considering buying a Mazda in the Houston area.",4.8

289,"August 16, 2011","What can I say about Russell and Smith Mazda? I had a few issues with a previous purchase that I was not happy about and was ready to move on to something new. To start with I was upside down from my previous trade, the new car I was driving had a few cosmetic issues, and I had little to no money to put down to the purchase of a new car. I had looked at a few dealers to get my car appraised and had mixed quotes some on par and other just plain ridiculous. When I was approached at R&SM about what I was wanting I knew I was on the short end of deal b/c I had nothing to really offer with my trade and the car I wanted was going to be a tough sell on price(Mazdaspeed3). I wasn't initially happy with the offer for the trade-in and of course that's how this whole thing works(find a starting point and work from there). From that point I expressed my interest in a particular car and we got the ball rolling. So not to drag this review out any further I will conclude with this, as unhappy as I was going in to buy a new car, R&SM's people took the time to listen to what I needed to have happen to make the deal work, what I wanted in buying a new car to be happy, and being patient and understanding with me and overcoming the issues at hand.

296,"July 11, 2011","I recently purchased a new 2011 Mazda CX-9 from Russell &amp;amp; Smith Mazda of Houston, Texas and the buying experience was the best I've ever had since buying my first car 41 years ago.  Gilton Huggett is a prince of a gentleman and really knows how to treat a customer right.  He is professional, caring and clearly knows his product, not only answering every question we had about the CX-9, but spending over an hour after the sale to cover every unique feature of the CX-9, demonstrate how the navigation system works, help my wife set up Bluetooth connectivity between the CX-9 and her iPhone, cover the most pertinent details regardng vehicle maintance and more.

If you're looking for a knowledgable salesman that will treat you right, not pushy but courteous to the bone, and willing to see that you get a competitive price, Gilton is your man. 

Before making our purchase we test drove several vehicles and competitive brands, meeting lots of salesmen in the process.   Although we could have chosen the car we wanted from several dealers, it was Russell &amp;amp; Smith Mazda's friendly sales and management team that gave us the best price, steering clear from pressuring us into making a decision, willing to answer all questions and demonstrating all the great features of the CX-9 that helped make the decision to use Russell &amp;amp; Smith a true no-brainer.  In the end, we not only got the car we wanted at the price we wanted, but we received a pleasurable buying experience to boot.

Working with Gilton made the whole process go by smoothly and enjoyable.  He's a class act all the way and was easy to deal with and talk to.  But his stock really rose in my book when he demonstrated he still cared about our business after the sale was already made.  For it was then that he took time away from selling cars to other prospects to provide us what he called the &quot;Gilford Huggett Training Experience.&quot;  (Might I add that he also has a great sense of humor).  

It became obvious during the training session that Gilton has taken the time to read the Mazda CX-9 manual from cover to cover and knows the vehicle better than any Mazda sales person on planet earth.   It was quickly clear that he wanted to ensure we drove away as happy customers and proud Mazda owners, for Gilton took plenty of time and care to ensure we were comfortable with all the bells and whistles our Grand Touring model has to offer.  I couldn't believe he spent over an hour training us and helping us setup navigation, Bluetooth and other features.  It was time well spent in my book, because it compelled me to come to this site and write a great review about what a wonderful buying experience we had.

If you live within 250 miles of Houston and are considering a Mazda, I guarantee you it will be time and gas well spent to drive to Houston and give Gilton a shot at your business and make you a no-obligation to buy offer.  I know I couldn't be happier with our deal unless someone else bought the car for me.  We bought a brand new Mazda CX-9 for the same price we were going to pay for a comparable Chevy Equinox LTZ with all the options Chevy offers, and the Mazda CX-9 is twice the vehicle of the Equinox in terms of quality, smoothness of ride, air conditioning, seating capcity and more.",5.0

Once I had my mind settled, I was forwarded to Delroy who was also very helpful.

304,"May 01, 2011","I moved to Houston about 18 months ago with a 2007 Mazda CX-9 that I purchased new along with an extended Mazda warranty. The car now has 24,000 miles on it and I thought that I might have a leaking rear shock absorber. That seemed to be unusual for a car with 24,000 miles so on 4/5/11 I took the car to Russell & Smith Mazda (the closest Mazda dealer to my house)to get it checked out. My ""service advisor"" was Omar Monelle who promptly told me there would be a $100 inspection fee. The leaking rear shock was confirmed, but no help was offered by Mazda and coverage was denied under the extended warranty. Omar told me that it was OK to only replace one rear shock, but that I would have to prepay to get the part ordered. I decided to delay that repair because I wanted to do some research on the issue. Omar was wrong - I was told by some reliable mechanics that shocks should always be replaced in pairs. For the CX-9 that amounts to a $500 bill for parts and labor - a very poor quality issue for a car with only 24,000 miles.  It seems that Mazda has designed the rear shocks so that they need to be replaced by dealers only. Nice for Mazda - bad for Mazda owners. Leaving me with a leaking rear shock, Omar was quick to bill my extended warranty for a new clock and a relay switch for the a/c system. Bottom line, I wasted over 2 hours and $100, the dealership billed over $600 and I am still stuck with a leaking rear shock. To top it off, the relay switch ""fix"" lasted 2 days. On 4/11/11, Omar e-mailed me that my new clock was in and I should contact him to make an appointment to get it installed. When I replyed via e-mail about some of my concerns, I never received any reply.

314,"March 04, 2011","I can't say enough great things about the sales experience when I bought my Mazda5!  William is an outstanding salesman, and knows his products!!  There is nothing worse than having a salesman showcase a car and not know the vehicle - and I never experienced that with William.  The test drive was fun, he was able to answer all of my questions, and he was a joy to work with.  I have always purchased Subaru vehicles because the sales staff knows how to show you all the benefits, and Mazda is right up there with them!  I had my 3 year old with me for the test drive and William was so accomodating to us and encouraged me to test it out with the car seats and didn't bat an eye when my son was sitting in each seat. That made the sale that much easier for me.  The manager Delroy was so friendly and made every effort to make sure I was happy with their service.  The entire sales team really made me feel welcomed and lived up to the saying that ""they want to earn your business"".

The entire process from test drive, pricing and financing was so easy!  The finance manager, Roy, has a great personality and gets you in and out without the stress that other dealerships put you through.  

I went to Russell and Smith because of their location as I planned to utilize their service department for routine maintenance. Unfortunately they don't live up to the same standard as their sales team, and I will be looking elsewhere for my vehicle maintenance.

Overall, if you are looking for a trustworthy Mazda dealer - I definitely promote the Russell and Smith Sales Team.",5.0

After the price was settled, we visited the dealership on Saturday morning, and Sutoyo had already pulled the car up front. It took about 2 hours to check out the vehicle, test drive and fill out all the paper work. He was very nice to make everything happening very smooth. It was later found a small dirty on the front hood which could not be washed off (might be due to bird drops or tree), and some polish work was needed. He arranged the work and made sure everything is fine before we pick up the car next Wednesday. He had even personally offered the help to drive my old car back to my office but I think that was just too much trouble for him so I picked it up with my friend.

336,"September 17, 2010","I contacted Gilton through internet sales with a very specific idea of what new car I wanted to purchase and price I was willing to spend. He is very responsive- responding to my e-mails promptly, mostly within half-an-hour. He also kept me informed of any ongoing sales in order to help my car search. Most importantly, he is honest, a rarity among the Mazda dealerships in this town. While some other dealers will use dishonest tricks to get you into their offices, such as refusing to give you specific numbers or telling you straight lies over e-mail or on the phone (chalking it up to ""miscommunication"" when you talk to them in person), Gilton will provide you all the numbers he can in as much detail as he can. But more importantly, they will be the same numbers he'll give you when you sit down with him. 

Of course, I wouldn't have bought a car if the price wasn't right, and Russell & Smith certainly gave me the best price out of the dealers I talked to (and I talked to or visited at least five). Yes, there was some back and forth, as there should be, but at least I was able to do all the negotiating through e-mail or on the phone in the comfort of my own home and office, saving me time, effort, stress, and gas money. Seriously, I spent less time at Russell & Smith buying a car than I did at other dealerships NOT buying a car. The way Gilton and Russell & Smith sells cars is the future of how cars will be sold.

I also worked with Gerald Johnson in financing. Though I was paying in cash and did not need financing, he quickly went over some vehicle protection options, and when I declined, he politely and professionally moved on and finished up our business.

370,"March 04, 2010","If you want to buy a new car, go to Russell & Smith Mazda and find Sutoyo. He is very nice and helpful. He gave me the best price I could find. After buying my Mazda3, I feel uncomfortable that this model has no remoter to lock or unlock the door. But Sutoyo helped me to equip one with the best price 3 days later.",5.0
371,"March 01, 2010","Overall, I am satisified with my purchase. I knew what I wanted and what price I wanted. I had to haggle for my trade-in. It was valued at $500 more through Carmax than what I negotiated in the end (with store manager), thus, I was frustrated. I've never purchased a vehicle where a dealer wouldn't either match or beat what Carmax offered. Since we were $500 off in the end, I was okay with it because of how much I'd save with 0% financing.

Also, the salesman was not able to get the exact vehicle I wanted (I wanted base model of the top package) as he said he should be able to do so through a dealer trade by the 0% finance deadline. Instead, he offered me a good deal on the next package up. I did not want to pay more but I do like the package so I reluctantly agreed because my wife liked it. 

He was honest with me and I really appreciated it. The other thing that put me off was the quote he gave included a $1,000 manufacturer incentive. However, he did not inform me up front that it would not be good combined with the 0% financing over 60 months. It was one or the other. To me, this was deceptive. As he put it, ""you didn't mention you wanted the 0% offer."" I shouldn't have to - who in their right mind wouldn't want that? It's a tactic that gets the person into the dealership. I'm sure most internet salespersons practice this.

Regardless, I'm happy overall with the experience. The salesman kept in touch with me responding to my emails on a timely basis and kept me in touch with the status of when the vehicle arrived from the port. I would recommend him but do know that you need to be detailed with initial inquiry or you too may feel a bit deceived. He did great with the price in my honest opinion. He seems to be a really good guy to deal with. 

He did ask me to rate him well and wanted to be able to make sure I did by talking with me if I had problems. However, what's the point of surveys if the buyer cannot be blunt honest? It defeats the purpose. I don't know if his commission is tied to it or not but I prefer to be honest with others so they are educated on others perceived experience.",4.5
372,"February 25, 2010","From beginning to end, this was the easiest car deal ever! My trade in price was exactly what I wanted. The price of the car could not have been beat! Not to mention, my salesman (Gilton) made the whole process easy and never made me feel pressured. I would send anyone to see Gilton!",5.0
373,"February 16, 2010",I enjoyed working with Sutoyo.  He communicated with me about where my car was in the shipping process and when it would be in the dealership.  He made the process easy and pleasant.  I felt he gave me a good deal on my trade in vehicle and a good deal on my new vehicle.  This is the third vehicle I have purchased from a Russell and Smith dealership as I have previously purchased a Ford and a Honda from them.  I would definitely purchase a vehicle from them in the future.   ,5.0
374,"February 16, 2010","I went to this dealer because it was much closer than the likes of Clear Lake. Overall, I was not disappointed.

Kenny let us test drive the car. I loved my MAZDA3 from the first second! Throughout the day, our conversations were helpful and friendly. Kenny did not pressure us through any part of the purchase process. He came in fairly high, but they matched an online quote from another dealer that I brought with me. Kenny also led me to believe that I would easily qualify for the 0.0% financing that was currently offered. However, as a first-time car buyer (I'm not aware of my credit score and should have been, but in conclusion it has great quality but little quantity), I was offered only a higher rate. He seemed genuinely confused; he said that 9 in 10 people in the market for a Mazda tend to qualify, from his experience. I really think he didn't think my situation through (we had talked about my background even before the credit check). We almost walked out, but they countered by changing the financing from 5 to 6 years. I countered with a five year deal that was above the original quote at 0.0% but sizable below their last five year offer. They met me in between by lowering the car price, raising the trade-in value, and talking the bank down a percentage point (that's Kenny and his manager looking out for us!). With the car priced significantly below invoice, I was happy to take the deal.

There wasn't much thrown at me during financing because they knew I was already at my limit (and the bank's limit).

Overall, Kenny was a good salesman, and helped us throughout the whole day. The worst part about the experience was that we were there from noon to beyond 7 pm.",4.6
375,"February 04, 2010","Sutoyo Sugiharto was very pleasent to work with.  He made our car buying experience enjoyable.  He put in a lot of effort to find us the exact car we were looking for, and worked to accomodate our needs.  I would recommend him and Russel and Smith to other customers looking for a Mazda.",4.5
376,"February 02, 2010",I was impressed with Sutoyo's attentiveness. We communicated via e-mail for the most part and were able to complete the deal in three days (including a Sunday). I even received an e-mail from Sutoyo at 12:30am. My experience with everyone at the dealership was great. I will recommend Russel & Smith to my friends. ,5.0
377,"January 30, 2010","WOW! Sutoyo was so professional and friendly, and gave me a great price. I was very impressed at how quick and easy it was to buy my new 2010 Mazda 3 Hatch. I highly recommend Sutoyo and Russell & Smith Mazda. I am so excited to be a new member of the Mazda family!",5.0
378,"January 14, 2010","I've been wanting a Mazdaspeed3 for several years now.  Unfortunately my credit was not good at all and I'm trying to rebuild.  I explained this with Sutoyo who understood and instead of just telling me no and to hit another dealer he worked with the finance department to find a deal.

I ended up getting approved with a 2nd-chance finance company.  Granted the interest-rate was maxed out and the car pricing was 4k over sticker due to ""lender fees"" but the bottom line was they made it happen.

So I'm not happy whatsoever with the financing, but Sutoyo and Russel & Smith Mazda really took care of me.  They were quick, communicative, and professional.

I had to take my car in the day after I picked it up for an alignment issue and the service manager was very helpful, explained what was wrong and how they fixed it.

I will definitely recommend Russell & Smith to my friends and colleagues.

Just make sure your credit is good or you're paying outright to avoid the finance issues I'm in.

I had been looking for over one year for a vehicle like the one I purchased, that was in great condition and a good value. The level of service was an added bonus. Carlos and John are true professionals.  ",5.0
380,"December 03, 2009","My husband and I came in to Russell and Smith Mazda with hopes of finding a good salesman who could help us make the right decision on a new car for our growing family.  I called the dealership before hand to make sure they had a good selection of new and used Cx-7s.  Sutoyo took my call and told me they had plenty to choose from so my husband and I went up there that afternoon.  He took his time with us showing us all of our options and letting me test drive about 5 different cars.  After much deliberation he gave us a deal that we just couldn't pass up.  He even got me into the upgraded model with leather seats that I didn't know we could even afford.  I love my new family car and I'm so thankful Sutoyo was there to help us through the process.  I'll recommend all my friends and family to him and Russell and Smith in the future, our experience was very plesant and I'm confident he helped us make the perfect decision on our new addition.",5.0
381,"November 28, 2009","This was the first dealership I went to in my quest to purchase a new car. (Russell & Smith Mazda)
As a California native, I was in a very bad spot, as my car was stolen here in Houston.I explained the situation to the sales person.  He took the time to listen to my concerns and input and I felt like he wanted to make me a deal I would feel comfortable with.  I didn't feel highly pressured into purchasing a car.  The sales person, (Kenny), kept returning to his manager with questions and input I had regarding the deal.  I was able to purchase the car I wanted for the price I had in mind.  The sales people continued to make sure I was confident in my purchase throughout the process.  They even called another dealership to locate the car I wanted when it wasn't in stock.  I felt like I got a good deal and friendly people to work with.  i would recommend this dealership to anyone looking to purchase a new vehicle.",4.8
382,"November 25, 2009","Sutoyo was a very nice, courteous, and helpful salesman - no pressure, no BS. Very accommodating to my schedule and let me take a solo test-drive in addition to the accompanied test drive. He agreed to get me a roof rack as part of the deal and he delivered. He even gave me a check for the difference when he found out the state's tax/title/license fee ended up being lower than I was originally charged when I bought the car. He also put my license plates and registration sticker on for me.

The only bad experience was with the financing - the check I wrote ended up being cashed before I told them to cash it (and before the deposit to cover it landed in my account). Luckily my bank waived the fee. The financing folks apologized for this, but it was still a frustrating situation. Just make sure you have your finances in order before writing a big check.

I rated 5's on all of the criteria above because Sutoyo was a good salesman and he deserves a good rating. I was expecting a nightmare for my first time buying a car, but it was fine. And I love my new car!",5.0
383,"November 24, 2009","Working with Sutoyo was the easiest car purchase I have had.  I located the vehicle I wanted via mazdausa.com, he provided me a quote via email that was several thousand under our local dealers.  We completed final 'Drive out' pricing, and finance details via email.  He picked us up at the airport, we signed the documentation at the dealer with no extra sales push, added 'undercoating' or other BS.  The car was already cleaned, prepped and ready and we were on our way in just over an hour.

No haggle, no pressure, no BS..  Just the car I wanted for a fantastic price.  Thanks again to Sutoyo & the rest of the Russell & Smith team",5.0
384,"November 19, 2009","When my daughter and I entered the dealership, we were given a friendly greeting.  After indicating the reason for our visit, our needs were specifically addressed.  There was efficiency in handling the reason for our visit:  the purchase of our new Mazda.  We appreciated the respect and concern we were shown during every step of the sales process.  Everyone was courteous and we felt like valued customers.  I would certainly recommend this dealership to any friend or family member.  I feel that I will get the assistance I need whenever I visit or call Russell & Smith Mazda in the future.",4.8
385,"November 14, 2009",Chad was very friendly and straightforward. He didn't try to play any price games and he made the car buying process as quick and easy as possible.

387,"November 13, 2009","Sutoyo gave us a price on our new Mazda 3 that other dealers couldn't (wouldn't)come near to. I was unsure that Russell & Smith would be where I bought my car when I arrived, but after meeting Sutoyo and having him give me an excellent ""drive-out"" price, I decided that I would buy my car at Russell & Smith almost immediately. They were 3rd on my list of the 4 dealers that I visited. The car buying experience at Russell & Smith was excellent. The actual day of delivery was a joy. Richard Giles was very personable in handling the finances, and Sutoyo made us feel completely at home. Thanks Russell & Smith for hiring and keeping such top notch people.",5.0
388,"November 11, 2009","Very straight-forward dealing. NO BS! They do what they say/agree-to and do not try to change anything. Sutoyo was great to deal with. They beat every other dealer's price, in part, by not adding hiogh ""excess profit"" items to the closing price, e.g., their doumentary fee was the lowest in the area. An honest deal among the dis-honest. ",5.0

They went above and beyond for our purchase, very patient and accomodating our baby time (it takes lot more time do do a simple task). They also ordered trunk cover for us and we oicked up after a month of purchase. Really great dealer. No hassle or games.",5.0

As an Automotive Engineer and Detroit-raised ""car guy"" with 40 years experience in the Industry, I have bought from and dealt with countless Dealerships, Sales people and Automotive Service Professional over the years, and even count two Detroit Dealer/Owners among my closest friends. In all that time, I can honestly say that I've never had a more positive, comfortable and satisfying car purchase experience than I had here in Texas with Mr. Sugiharto and Russell and Smith. I was treated with courtesy, respect and without pressure and am completely pleased with my purchase.",5.0

My experience from the day I decided to go online to overstock.com to look for the crossover of my dreams has been one of pure pleasure. Mr. Sugiharto truly listened to what I wanted and was able to deliver. The whole experience was stress free, something I don't need more of in my already stressful life. I also have to mention the finance manager Mr. Giles, whose smooth handling of my purchase made the experience totally complete.

Sutoyo was easy to talk to and very couteous to my sister during her purchase, which was her first car to buy.  After seeing how well he handled her I decided to look into buying a car from him and he gave me the offer I wanted so I bought a new car also.

394,"October 17, 2009","Searching for car was a night mare before I met Sutoyo from Russell and Smith Mazda. I never thought that purchasing a car would be that easy. Most of the communication are done with email. One phone call for a price talk and one visit for the test drive and more negotiation.Sutoyo is very nice sale person. He is a listener. He listened to my comment and concern patiently(I work as a Quality Assurance engineer and you can imagine how picky I can be). I didn't feel any pressure at all. He took care of all my requests. If something is beyond his control then he worked with his boss to make sure that we are happy with the resolution. This is the first time I feel like ""Customer is always right"" in a car dealership. He followed up with my after my purchase to make sure that eveything is ok and i am happy with my new car. I would recommend Sutoyo from Russel Smith Mazda to any buyer who want to save time, money and energy. In my case, it only took 4 emails, 2 phone calls and 2 visits which is approximately 5 hrs total. I am happy with my new car.",5.0

They said they would fix it when I pick up my license plate - so great customer service! They will take care of it, and I would recommend Russel & Smith to family and friends.",5.0
