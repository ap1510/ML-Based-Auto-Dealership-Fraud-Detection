0,"February 17, 2020","Sold me a vehicle that was ""Certified Pre Owned"" with two open recalls, didnt transfer Ford Certified Warranties to my name and here 9 months later still trying to deal with. 
4 Months after I purchased the vehicle transmission went out, took it to the shop and there it sat for 5 months. During that time they lied non top to me and Ford Tech (from corporate office) about what they where doing. Have emails from them that my vehicle was in the bay up and trans mission out even through at the exact same time my vehicle is in back of the shop parking lot ( I have photos dated and time stamped). They issued me paperwork saying they removed transmission and found nothing wrong. I had vehicle transferred to another dealership and it was confirmed transmission was never removed, filled with fluid yes (I had two leaks and they had to fill it with fluid so I could leave with it...which it leaked out by the time I went 17 miles down the road but remember nothing is wrong with this transmission). Second dealership completely rebuilt transmission after they actually removed it and found a long list of things wrong as well as two leaks. Platinum kept telling me they removed the Auto Body value and it was fine, when in reality they did not and it was not. Platinum Ford does NOT have a transmission mechanic on staff. Instead of telling me this they continued to lie to me, Ford Tech, Ford Customer Service rep for 5 months...then placed a false claim on my warranties (which where still not in my name). 

DO NOT BUY, DO NOT HAVE SERVICE DONE at Platinum Ford

Owner was contacted multiple times, he is aware of this and has ignored me and evidence shown to him HE ALLOWS this to happen. So while The Gilchrist name & Southwest Name mean something to his family they mean nothing to him....he allows people to be treated this way. ",1.0

2,"January 27, 2020","Took my vehicle in for oil change, and they parked it in the mud. which resulted in mud in my vehicle. Left finger prints all around the fenders around  hood. No detail to taking care of someone else’s vehicle.  After parking my car at home. It was remnants of oil on my driveway from the oil change",3.0
3,"January 24, 2020","You need to run background checks on your salesmen. I was surprised to see that Juan Carlos Olvera and Juan Carlos Olvera Jr work there. They are even in your commercials. Do you have a habit of putting convicted criminals in your commercials? They are crooks with convictions for drugs, assault, DUI, credit card fraud and identity theft (stole identities of their customers). They were on the news for selling cars at Rayo Motors without titles and with air bags removed. People got hurt. 

Look at cases in Dallas County (CC-18-06725-B, CC-11-05430-C, DC-13-05017, CC-05-12238-D), Rockwall County (1-18-1530, 3-06-146, 3-05-171, CI04-15, CR04-0333, 3-04-25, 3-04-256), and Van Zandt (12-14-00168). That's just a few of them. They were evicted in Rockwall twice, Garland twice, Dallas, and Edgewood. They trashed the commercial and residential properties before they were evicted. Stole everything they could. 

When your customers give them their information for financing a car, they will steal their identity and rack up debt. And they will steal air bags out of the cars before they sell them. That's a fact. They've done it before, been caught, been in the news, been convicted in court over and over again. 

Google search their names. Juan Carlos Olvera.",1.0

5,"January 10, 2020","Able to schedule over the phone. They were on-time and made it easy to drop off. Also they rotated tires at no charge. Finally they told me what to expect on the next service call, no surprises, I like that.",4.8
6,"January 06, 2020","I purchased a new 2019 F150 Lariat FX4 from Platinum Ford on 12/20/2019. I went in without an appointment and the process took time which is expected but the online price for the truck was not what they actually wanted for the truck. The online price took into account every rebate Ford offers and there is no way to qualify for every exemption. We came to a price that I believe was fair but the entire process took almost 6 hours. There was no sense of urgency from any member of the dealership to get my new truck ready and get me out of there. The real trouble started when I took the truck back to get my bed liner installed that was part of the purchase of the new truck.

After having the truck for 6 days I went to pick it up and the bed liner install was terrible. There was over spray on my cab and on my rear window. They made no attempt to remove the box link plates installed in the bed so there is no liner under them and they are covered in liner, the button for the lighting in the bed was covered with liner and the overall install was very poor. When I pointed it out and went to talk to the sales manager I was told that the shop they used had messed up another truck the week prior and that they would send it somewhere to get it fixed. The sales managers barely even looked up from there computers and never once offered to go look at the truck with me to see my concerns. The salesman I dealt with had the truck taken to a sister dealership where they got 95% of the overspray off my truck(not all of it) and where they corrected some of the install and uncovered the bed bolts and the light switch in the bed. They did not remove the box link plates or clean the bed liner off of them so the box link tie downs cannot be installed. The truck has been through the make ready area 3 times for a ""detail"" and has never once been returned to me clean. I took the truck back from them and will have someone else fix the issues and will never return to the dealership again. Through the process I called and left messages for the General manager as well as spoke to the sales manager and no one could even be bothered to return my calls while they had my truck trying to fix their mistakes. Jacob was my salesman and he did his best to try to solve the issue but if you cannot even inspect a customers truck before returning it to them, that shows just how much you care about service after the sale.",1.6

8,"December 23, 2019","I was having an issue with the steering on my 2018 F350. I took it in for repair work and found there was a technical service bulletin on my truck. Parts have been ordered, but, unfortunately they will take 6 to 8 weeks to arrive. Jason, the Service Advisor, and the dealer parts manager have done outstanding work in an attempt to get my truck safely back on the road. I'm looking forward to the parts coming in so the truck will be back to 100%.. Hopefully, they will arrive earlier than projected.",5.0

10,"December 08, 2019","Driving from Forney over to Terrell for shopping, I ran over an object on the road, which quickly cut down the right front tire.  I was approximately 1 mile West of the Platinum Ford dealership.  I called my insurance company to take my car to the Ford dealership.  It took awhile to get it there, but once I got there Micheal went to work.  I had installed a new set of Toyo tires a year earlier, and asked him to replace the damaged tire, with the same brand.  With a few phone calls, he found the correct size, and it was delivered about an hour later.  He then provided us with a loaner car.  We had just got back home, and Michael called to say that the car was ready.  So we returned and pickup up my car.
Platinum Ford in  short time what had been a disaster for the past four hours stuck out on the road.
Thank you to all the Platinum crew involved. ",5.0

15,"November 04, 2019","Took my car in on Friday afternoon for a non-warranty issue and they stuck to the labor hours they estimated.  Got me in a loaner car and back on the road in no time!  Felt like they respected my time and didn't give me a run around.  They even suggested I go ahead and get the oil changed and tires rotated since the car was already there.  Very straight forward and able to get on with my day!

My compressor that keeps my leveler working was replaced and functions like new. This was just 5 days ago. I was advised to watch it if it begins to appear leaking again. My service technician, Mike Woodall advised me daily while the work was being done. He is an asset to The Platinum Team.   Iirecommend this service department very highly.

27,"September 08, 2019","After visiting several dealerships in the city, I was frustrated with all the “add-ons” and hidden prices. I headed home to Terrell and stopped by Platinum Ford just to take a look at a couple of cars, not intending to buy. I’d read their online reviews and was impressed with their excellent ratings. Everyone was so nice; straight forward, honest pricing. I found my perfect SUV at a great deal and drove away a happy customer. I absolutely recommend Playinum Ford as a 5 Star dealership.",5.0

31,"August 26, 2019","Shopping new vehicles is definitely not high on my ""favorite things to do"" list.  Booker L. and Gary W.
changed that for me.  Both were very forthcoming with vehicle details and in price negotiation. Many of our conversations were outside of business hours, which speaks highly of their work ethic. Booker knows the importance in treating potential buyers with honesty and respect.  When I was in a bind to take delivery of the vehicle, Booker went the extra mile to drive me to the dealership. I have no regrets making the 60 mi. drive to make the purchase. Thank you to the team at Platinum Ford!",5.0
32,"August 23, 2019",Traveled to Texas in 107 deg. F. weather to pick up a new mini horse and my air conditioning went out.  Called five different ford dealerships before talking to Platinum Ford.  Believe it was Mike I spoke to who not only made room for my vehicle the next morning but also asked if I needed help finding a facility for the mini horse.

34,"August 05, 2019","drop truck off Thursday at 730 am for 40K service. told should be ready by noon
called at noon was told be ready in 45 minutes
showed up to pick up vehicle was told mechanic broke fuel line and would have to be ordered
had to wait for loaner car
went out of town that evening returned to pick up vehicle on the following Monday afternoon
was told may not be ready, this after 4 working days
it was however ready, they temporarily lost keys, found keys. finally was able to drive it home
, there was also a question of warranty or extended service plan which was purchased thru ford not 3rd party. 
overall very aggravating experience and would not recommend your dealership to anyone.

38,"May 01, 2018","We (my wife and I) were in the market for a new Ford Fusion. We must have contacted 10 dealerships in the Dallas/Ft. Worth area trying to score a good deal. Platinum Ford was the only one that shot us straight and didn't try to play all those shady car dealership games most of them like to play. They were willing to get us the car we wanted at a price we liked. Our sales guy Pete was amazing. No pressure, no hard sells, just friendly service. Thank you Pete! We handled the whole transaction via email and they had the car, and all the paperwork ready to go when we arrived. It was a quick in and out with a free bottle of water for the long drive home =) They definitely earned our business for life. 

I've purchased 5 vehicles over the last 20 years and I have to say this is one of, if not the best car buying experience we've ever had. We drove over and hour and a half from our home to do business here but after the experience we had I would gladly drive from Houston or Austin to do business here. Its worth the drive! Shop them first and you won't need to shop anywhere else.",5.0
39,"March 28, 2018","From the time of contact via email to purchase, there was no pressure and they stood behind what they said in all areas, all the time and in a very relaxed and pleasurable environment.  I highly recommend Platinum for your auto needs.  I would and will use them again. ",5.0

Chad was very professional, hekpful, and nice. The cars seemed to be well taken care of in the preowned area of the dealership. When we sat down to go over the paperwork there was no funny business that took place like sneaky extra things in contract or anything. I'm so excited to have my new vehicle, well used but new to me!

45,"June 06, 2017","Looking for our son's first vehicle I felt would be daunting. We had a budget in mind and I was afraid of what that end budget would manifest itself to look like in the vehicle. We started by researching brands, models, safety features and found what we felt was the right choice for us.
From the beginning our sales person, Chad Ragsdale was responsive to these concerns and recommended several similarly priced models so that we had a good variety of choice. We ended up going with our original pick, a 2012 Hyundai Genesis. 
Fast forward a month or so, one concern was that we only had one set of keys to the vehicle and a dwindling list of where to get an extra copy. Mr. Ragsdale went above and beyond and tracked down the previous owner for us and was able to procure that set of keys as well. That level of commitment after the point of sale is a dying art.
Thank you to Mr. Ragsdale and Randal Noe used vehicles for making this a very positive experience.

I soon heard back from a representative that the vehicle was not""certified but ""certifiable"", i.e. eligible to be certified, and that if certified during the sale an additional cost would be added, basically an extended warranty . Why then advertise this vehicle as ""Certified""on the website? I reasonably assumed based on the dealerships own advertising that the vehicle already was ""Certified"". After thinking about this overnight I called back to cancel my appointment to check out the vehicle.

51,"July 31, 2016","UGH!  Where do I start?  The overall service was far less than par, and we ended up chasing the service rep, who we later found out was only days on the job.  We received the call that the truck was ready to be picked up, so we make the hour plus drive up to the dealership only to learn it was not in fact ready after all ... and we waited for well over 3 additional hours.  Icing on the cake occurred when we drove off the lot and had to immediately stop to put gas in the truck as the dealership refused to fill the tank.

68,"June 07, 2016","I have been a long time repeat customer of Randall Noe in Terrell buying many vehicles , mostly Dodge Ram trucks and experiencing different sale reps. By far the 2  best i have had were Richard whom is no longer with Randall Noe and Craig Bloomquist who I highly recommend !! Craig was terrific to deal with & would call, text and e-mail me with anything i requested and  kept me updated on my requests & questions.. He differently works for you- the customer and is simply the best which is exactly the service i would expect. You may have to wait longer at Randall Noe but that is only because they go the extra mile in finding exactly what you want. If they don't have it on the lot and you don't want to wait to order what you want they will look high and low for you to find exactly what you want and are a great group of guys to deal with. Most other dealers just want to unload whats on their lot and make you fit to it but at Randall Noe in Terrell they truly look for what YOU want and make the vehicle fit to your needs and their prices are the best.

Finance wasn't hell bent and adding extras to the car, but informative and allowed you to make educated decisions.  

Was the dealership like one of those mega stores?  No.  BUT inhabiting lower cost facilities equaled to lower cost vehicles.  I shopped at another dealership which will not be named, but their initials are Rockwall Ford.  They would not budge on my trade in or the price of the car.  Randall did both.

89,"April 28, 2016","I had a problem with my 2012 Ford Truck whereas the charge air cooler (intercooler or CAC) cools the intake air as it goes through the turbocharger. Apparently, during this process the CAC produces condensation and the buildup will intensify even more so under wet or humid conditions. Upon periods of sudden acceleration the engine or cylinders will begin to misfire which can and will cause damage to the CAC and its coils, spark plugs and sometimes your catalytic converter. This all occurred to my vehicle with the exception of the catalytic converter and it has under 54K miles. Corporate FORD is well aware of the problem as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration with Corporate FORD's ""cooperation"" investigated the matter after both parties received multiple complaints citing safety issues. Basically, the vehicle stalls out on you momentarily where you are unable to gain any acceleration power.

The NHTSA dropped the investigation after Corporate issued a Technical Service Bulletin (TSB) to install a new after-market ""deflector shield"" to protect the CAC from water build up.

After, finding all this information on my own accord and being told my vehicle was not equipped with a deflector shield. Corporate Ford refused to reimburse free of cost any of the parts referenced above that were damaged by what I consider to be a manufacturer defect. The kicker here is you even get to pay for the install and the deflector shield itself.

However, at the dealership, ALEX my service assistant specialist and the mechanic assigned to my vehicle could not have been more helpful and understanding of my situation. Alex put his neck on the line and did his best to cut as many costs as he was capable of doing on his own. Probably even getting ripped a new one by Corporate. 

I only wish Corporate Ford would not hide under their legal definition of ""maintenance issues"" and make it right and own up to their shortcomings. This type of problem may be found on any 3.5 liter engine Ford trucks from 2011 to 2013. Make sure you have a fancy ""deflector shield"" affixed in your truck the next time you go in to have your truck serviced.

How can I spend that kind of money on a truck and they can't give a spare key?  They also miss advertised the price.  I should have got up and walked out but that is my own fault.

I swore I would never go back.  After a couple of years I give them the benefit of the doubt and go back because they are the closest dealer to my resident.  Went back to get oil changed and like everyone else they check many areas of the automobile. They bring me a dirty air filter, and I ask how much for a new one and they tell me $24.00.  At time to check out the final bill is $53.95 and they charge for labor on the air filter.  They say oh, we made a mistake.

150,"February 16, 2016",Frist of all the only reason I gave the dealership a fair rating was because of Chad the used car salesman. Chad did a great job and went above and beyond helping out. The vehicle I purchased was a 2013 Ram 3500 Lamarie Longhorn. One of the reason I chose this truck was because it was listed as a certified vehicle. Well guess what I have not even had the truck a week and it is already in the repair shop. I live about 200 miles from your dealership so I had to take it to another local Dodge dealership. The check engine light has come on and it has some other problems. The automatic door locks doesn't work and it has a turn signal light out along with one of the running lights. I bought this vehicle thinking it had gone through some kind of checklist to be listed as certified. The certified label gave me more peace of mind thinking I had purchased a vehicle that had been inspected and checked over. I'm very upset with the whole situation and would never again purchase a vehicle through a Randall Noe dealership or recommend them to anybody. This has started out to be one of the worst decisions I have made in a long time. Plus to top it out I left my Ray Ban sunglasses on the Finance managers desk walked out came back to get them and they were gone. When I asked him about it he said that he thought he had seen them but then stated he must have been wrong. This should have been an omen to what kind of people I was dealing with a dishonest Finance Manager. That made me wonder what else he had tried to stick me with that I wasn't aware of. I don't like to think of people that way but after my experience there it just puts a bad taste in my mouth and is a very bad reflection on your dealership as a whole.,2.2
151,"February 16, 2016","My mom and I stopped by to look at Subaru Foresters last May 2015.  We checked out so many of them. In and out to measure the leg room. We spent over an hour there. We determined I needed to pay off my Honda then I might be able to afford a Forester. I started looking again about a month ago. I stopped by last week to check out a 2015 used Forester. I had $4,000 to put down on it. I told her I had to go home and think about it. No pressure. I went back on Thursday evening. She gave on the price some and then they did a number to get me an interest rate below 2%. Everyone was so nice. I picked up the Forester on Saturday afternoon. They helped me set-up the radio so it linked with my phone, so I could answer or make calls by voice hands free. They wanted to make sure I understood and knew how to work all the great buttons the car came with.",5.0

161,"February 03, 2016","I bought my 2012 F150 Ecoboost from Randall Noe in Dec 2012.  In June 2013, six months after I bought the truck, the back glass had to be replaced because water was leaking into the cab (covered under Ford Mfg warranty).  In the Fall of 2015 I started experiencing the same issue. We had been in a drought the last couple of years so I had not noticed any water leakage. Once we started getting rain again, the dam broke. I took my truck into Randall Noe, only to be told this was a known issue with this truck model yet, it was not covered under the extended warranty.  $475 later I have a new brake light and my back glass has been resealed. The service department informed me that I would probably have to have this done every 2 years. What the xxxx?  If it's a known issue, fix it, PERMANENTLY. Otherwise you're just ripping people off (Ford and Randall Noe).

In addition to the flood coming into the cab of my truck, the heater has been blowing hot air only when I'm accelerating.  When at a stop, it blows cool air.  Not only that, but there is a fan that has been kicking on rather loudly.  I've not noticed this in the 3 years I've owned the truck.  It's a new issue, probably related to the heater.  The service department was unable to replicate the problem, yet as soon as I drive to work the next day (35 degrees outside) I'm being pelted with cold air every time I stop during my 45 min commute.  The fan is also is kicking on periodically and is louder than my engine. 

What really bothers me is that I live 20+ miles from Randall Noe and work even farther, yet I am forced to take my truck to their service department if I want anything fixed under my extended warranty.  I was told that if I lived <50 miles from their dealership, I had to use them if I wanted something covered under warranty.  That's a bunch of crap.  Everyone knows that a 20-30 mile drive in DFW could take you an hour or more.  This makes trying to get my truck to/from Randall Noe an extreme inconvenience.  I was not informed of this when I purchased the warranty. I was also not informed that my ""free"" oil changes had to be done at their service department.  Again, quite the inconvenience for anyone living outside of Terrell.  This was our second car/truck purchase from Randall Noe and it will be our last.  I don't feel as if they were completely upfront with us when we purchased the truck. 

I would like to add that Brooke, in the service department, was very friendly and tried to help as best she could. No ill will towards her, I think she did a fine job.  But, I am disappointed that we were unable to determine what is wrong with my heater.  My extended warranty runs out in about 3K miles and I feel as though I'm being screwed. I want to take my truck somewhere else but I'm sure I'll have to pay another diagnostic fee just to have it looked at and the warranty won't cover what needs to be repaired. I'll end up having to pay everything out of pocket again for something that should have been addressed and covered under warranty at Randall Noe in the first place.

My advice to anyone purchasing a new vehicle is to buy local, close enough that you don't mind driving to the dealership to have it serviced.  Our next vehicle will definitely be bought local.",2.4

182,"January 12, 2016","My experience was not entirely terrible. I did wind up with a good vehicle at a fair price and my salesman was a nice guy...however what it took to get to that point is another story. The truck was advertised on their site and auto trader for the same price. I called negotiated the deal and thought I was good to go until I got a call stating that the vehicle was actually going to cost me $1500 more because of some extras they put on it that wasn't in the advertised price?? Finally after several calls and strong words they agreed to sell to me at the advertised price but would remove the items.from the vehicle! One of which was a bedliner... I do not believe they even had a bedliner on it.

The next issue I had was with the bill of sale they sent to my lender. They where trying to charge me an additional $1700 in Texas state taxes but being an out of state buyer I should not be charged those. So again I had to call and get it corrected.

I was pre approved for a $33 k loan and the first day was wasted with them bouncing around about which truck that I could finance. End of day one ended with them saying they could only finance $28k. Being the person that I am, I believe in loyalty, I went back the second day with a renewed attitude. I was told I could only purchase a used vehicle. I found several, but once again the price issue arose. I found another used vehicle and low and behold, after haggling and being talked into gap insurance and extended warranty, they financed $33k for a used vehicle. I happily drove my ""new"" vehicle off the lot to realize that I had missed a grinding in the front end during my test drive. I proceeded back to dealership and thankfully they gave me a loaner for the weekend. They had showed me a carfax report that showed vehicle was clean and trouble free. I didn't read the report in detail. My mistake. After the weekend and receiving my vehicle on Monday, I went home and pulled carfax report myself. The vehicle was wrecked while in Randall Noe possession a couple of months earlier. My concern is they never said vehicle had been wrecked and repaired. They refused to finance $33k for a new vehicle but pressured me into a $33k loan for used wrecked vehicle. Sales people were very friendly and helpful. The vehicle seems to be fine, but lesson learned. If anyone is every in the market for a vehicle I can only advise the consumer to read everything that is presented to you.

The finance guy was nice as well, however during our visit it was interrupted by someone else who worked there saying that he skipped someone else and should have helped them first, makes more sense to me that he finish with me and then move on and this of course caused a delay in my process, not professional customer service at this point goes out the window.  I was never greeted by a manager thanking me for my business as I have been with all my other purchases, I had to walk all the way back to the area where my truck was, if you know the parking lot you know a long walk is possible, not that I minded that, I need the exercise, it just tells you the communication there is par at best. I am now back in Wichita, Ks and am having truck looked over.  I was told by the salesman that they do a thural walk through and inspection of the truck.  I do not believe that at all, the plug to check the differential fluid was never removed, the oil looked as black as knight, so it was not changed or at the very least informing me to get it replaced. The int. of the truck smelled so bad and I still have not been able to remove the smell. The salesman offered to find me some spray to help with the smell,  the fluid for the window wash was almost empty, all of this is a big deal to a business owner like myself, I take a lot of pride in my trucks and I normally buy new and I am worried now that the truck will not be in the kind of condition that i had hoped, whatever kind of inspection they do there on there vehicles is not a good one by far.

223,"December 02, 2015","I drove 300+ miles to purchase a 2007 maroon trailblazer however, the vehicle was not ready, dirty and not going to be ready for sometime,  I feel like I was played and ended up settling on a different suv. It is alright but not what I came for. I do not feel much joy",2.4

226,"November 30, 2015","Ford has had a recall for the 2014 Escape since May 2015 on the fuel pump. Unfortunately parts have not been available. I have tried 3 times with multiple dealers to get this accomplished.
Randall Noe inspected my car, determined my Escape is one which had the defective fuel pump and obtained the part for me.

Thank you Randall Noe",4.2
227,"November 29, 2015","I am very happy with the sales staff's communication and assistance in completing this sale. I traveled by airline from northern California to DFW airport where I was picked up by a member of Randall Noe's 
staff. They had held this vehicle for me for a month with only a small deposit. They also reduced their
already low price to help offset my travel cost to pick up the vehicle. The vehicle was in great shape
as was described. The whole purchase process took less than 2 hours and I was on the road back home. I would recommend this dealership for purchase of a new or used vehicle.",5.0

232,"November 25, 2015",I've purchased 5 new Harley Davidson motorcycles and a dozen new cars or trucks in my life and this was the easiest most comfortable purchase I've ever made. They worked to get me enough trade so I could purchase the new truck and all I was really going in for was to look. I told them at first contact that I was only looking and that I owed too much on my trade to be willing to trade. They made it possible for me to get into the truck I wanted. ,5.0
233,"November 25, 2015",I wasn't called when they found out they were unable to repair my car. Then you have no rent cars even though my extended warranty covers it. I was called the next day around 4:30 that they finally figured out how to fix it. I had already taken it to Rockwall & they had finished the repair along with giving me a rent car. I have a Jeep Grand Cherokee with only 6K miles on it. Very poor customer service.,1.0
234,"November 25, 2015",Sale process was very professional.  Post Sales support was very helpful.  I have enjoyed working with all staff at Randall Noe Ford and will recommend them whenever possible.,5.0
235,"November 18, 2015","I took in my 2015 Dodge Dart to have the tail light on my trunk looked at since it was out (found out only 3 days after purchase).  After waiting 3 hrs for my car to be service, I was informed that the racetrack lighting on the trunk of my car (a cosmetic feature that gives the Dart a unique look) was not a standard feature... even on the SE. I was not informed that I was not receiving this option as I was told it was standard.  After informing the dealership about this I was told that they could install it but the cost was north of $400.  This service was a complete waste of my time.",1.0

I have always had confidence in Randall Noe's work on this and other vehicles that I own. I have never had a problem with this facility. They are knowledgeable, honest, and thorough in there maintenance. I bought it there and I will have it serviced there!   ",5.0
241,"November 16, 2015",I've worked with Randall Noe service before and they have always been professional and courteous. This was a routine 6K checkup for my Subaru and DC is always prompt and has great customer service. The turn around time for my Crosstrek was faster than I anticipated. No complaints. Great team and great company. Thanks.,5.0
242,"October 30, 2012","They gave me a price and trade in over the phone and once I arrived at the dealership it was as if I hadn't talked to anyone.  Had to do the same old BS with a salesman.  Treated me like a was a dumb***.  I gave them my credit card number to hold vehicle and as of one week later, they have not credited my account even thou I bought the vehicle.  I have talked with several employees at Randal Noe (Terrel) and nobody wants to help resolve this issue.  Oh yea, I even bought a vehicle from them.  Was mistake.",1.8
