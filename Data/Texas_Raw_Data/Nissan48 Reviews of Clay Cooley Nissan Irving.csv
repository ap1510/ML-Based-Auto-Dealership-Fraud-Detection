Janet lied to me so I would drive in from Hugo, Ok, then stole one of my truck keys.
Never buy from Clay Cooley Auto Group or Janet Gonzales.!!",1.0
1,"March 04, 2020","I purchased a used vehicle from Clay Cooley in early  November 2019, it is now March 2020 and I still do not have permanent, legal license plates.  I have called the dealership multiple times -- usually have to leave a voice mail that is never returned.  Even left a voice mail for the General Manager, Hector Lebron, with no response whatsoever.  
This is a classic example of a dealership not caring one bit about customer service one they have your cash and the car is off the lot! ",1.8

5,"September 16, 2019","I give them a 5 star rating as Roland Lynn, our Sales Manager, did a fantastic job. He was thorough and made sure we understood everything about the vehicle we selected. Roland made sure we were comfortable with our purchase. Roland partnered us with the Finance Manager, Fabiano. From a finance standpoint,  the bank terms and review of the bank documents was thorough. At no time, did we feel like we were rushed. Roland and Fabiano were very diligent and ensured we had a great experience. I would highly recommend this team for all vehicle purchases. Thank you, Roland, for all your hard work! You guys are awesome!",5.0
6,"September 07, 2019","Ernie Resendez is the best salesman. Pretty simple right? I mean, that's who facilitated the deal, that's who called me right away, but didn't pressure me. That's who followed up with short simple texts the days leading up to me finally coming in, but never annoyed me. That's who casually waited with me in the 105 degree 5:30 p.m Texas weather while I drove not one, but two vehicles and went back and forth several times just making sure I didn't miss any detail, and he only helped me more. Ernie was the third sales person I had dealt with at the third dealership I talked with. The others were exactly what ive come to fear when the time comes to getting a new car, its more like going to the dentist these days. Welcome to Clay Cooley in Irving(NISSAN). I was actually shopping for a truck in the used lot, a great deal that nobody else could match after weeks of online searching. I will admit, the place is a dump. Not the fault of staff, everyone was great, first class personnel, second class infrastructure. All that matters though, A/C and free bottled water, along with a competent sales person. But I got better than that, I got Ernie. He will work with you, and be very honest and transparent from the get go. There was only one little hook that almost sent us to my plan b car but it was not their fault and we were able to get around it. The Finance manager was also fantastic, but I cannot remember a name at the moment. Bottom line, from my experience, if you are looking for a slight used car check with Ernie at Clay Cooley first, I wish I had known that when I started looking. ",5.0

10,"August 31, 2019","I found a 2019 Nissan SV Midnight Edition on Cars.com at a great price. I was told by Roland Sr. that they could do an even better price. I made the drive to Irving only to find out the car was not Midnight Edition. It was the standard SV. I was talking with Ray at this time and he apologized profusely. I believe it was an honest mistake. The Midnight Edition price was not going to be honored by them, though, and the offer they gave me was $5,000 more than we talked about on the phone. Mistakes happen so I was not that upset, I was just ready to go on my way. Ray said he would get his boss, Roland Jr., to come talk to me. Roland Jr. came in and acted like I was crazy for offering the price we had agreed to on the phone. I told him that I was told by his dad, Roland Sr., that I could get the Midnight Edition at that price. At this point, I knew we would not get close price wise. I was not going to throw a fit, I was just going to move along. But Roland Jr. came in acting like I disrespecting him by offering the price that was agreed to. I have been in customer service of some sort my whole life and he was not representing the company well.  He was scoffing at the things I had to say and being very combative. I told him I did not like the way he came in this room with an attitude when they were the ones that were false advertising. He told me it had been a long day. I told him I would look at a regular SV and he acted like I was an inconvenience to him for wanting to look at another truck. When he walked out, I told Ray that I did not want to see Roland Sr. again. I have been to 10 dealerships in the last 3 days and this is by far the worst experience I have had. They actually have the best price on the Fontier S that I am going to buy today but I am not going to give them my money and you should not either.",1.2

41,"March 12, 2019","I went to Clay Cooley Nissan in Irving to purchase a car after going all over DFW looking for a vehicle. When I got there I was already on edge and furious but Mariah didn’t pay that any attention. She helped me and showed me great customer service even though I wasn’t the easiest to deal with. I purchased the car thinking that I was going to have to put down a lot of money because my credit was bad but I ended up only paying $500 down. I’m very happy with my vehicle and payments. Just wanted to let them know how good of a job they did. When I’m ready for a new one I’ll be to see you! If you’re looking for a car go see them, they will help you!",5.0
42,"March 12, 2019","So here it goes….I bought a used 2015 Nissan Rogue SV in March 2018 from a salesman that was fair with me, but once I got home after financing, things were not as I and my wife were advised. I was told I was paying $436 a month at an 8% interest rate. This included $34.00 monthly for a “service package” which was paid directly to the dealer and not financed but was somehow included in my monthly payment. So I am paying $8,987.64 in interest on a $17,000 car. And got sold a $2,469.56 service package, for oil changes. 
Fast forward to January. I get an email telling me I am eligible for a upgrade with no down at a lower interest rate as a loyal customer. I go in and they tell me the payment for a 2019 Rogue Sport SV is $755 a month and NMAC has a program where the payment will go down in 4 months after 4 consecutive payments by $200-250 a month. 
I ask for proof and they tell me over the phone the NMAC representative in there in their office and location just for this. I can speak to him when I come in.
I come in and the finance guy Jade has a piece of scratch paper with $755 in a sharpie marker and a highlighter spot for me to sign. I said no way I refuse to sign as I told you until I get concrete details. 
He said ,”bye then”.
That’s my great customer service story (and I am leaving out the 2 consecutive days of 3+ hours I spent there waiting before leaving).
# days later me and my wife go to get her a new car and upgrade and she is notified her credit has been hit 7 times without her consent by this dealership running her credit. Her score was 7 points lower.
They never once asked for her consent or mine to use her. They kept asking for her information and I refused as I had no details.
Then today the sales agent (the only honest one there) told me they still wanted to work with me, and his boss asked to get me back. I told him I need proof of this program at NMAC and wanted to speak to the guy personally as I know its not true after calling NMAC and inquiring and they were appalled Clay Cooley would misrepresent themselves and illegally run my wife’s credit, and mine they ran 13 times. Why I have no idea except desperation to get me approved. 
This is just the beginning for me pursuing what is right. I will not rest until I am finally treated right, and they fix their wrongs. 
Do not buy from them without a lawyer or police officer, then you may have a fair shot.
I am personally fearful to take my car there for my over-priced service package as I feel retaliation.
Maybe the manager has some dignity lets see…………

43,"March 11, 2019",James sheppard was a great salesman. He helped me out on a car deal. Great customer service and staff. Took care of me and what I was looking for. ,4.8
44,"February 09, 2019","Never deal with Jude at Clay Cooley. He was so misleading and wasted my time. He made me feel like a hostage because even though I asked him for my keys three times he continued to have me wait by giving me a new excuse. Wasted 6 hours only to find out that he was trying to sell my car on his own, apart from Clay Cooley and get me into a higher payment car. He even advised us not to pay our current payment on our car because it would be sold by them.  Now the only reason I found out was when I was doing my paperwork with finance there was never a mention of my car and they were trying to sell me the new car at a way higher price stating that both prices were in the contract just to realize it was never true. I wish there could be something done on the way they do business I wish nothing more than them to fail. They wanted me to sign this paper that they constructed to sell my car on auto trader or auction. Needless to say I canceled all paperwork and the contract with them they ended up giving me my keys but not one time apologized.
After a BBB complaint they called me back asking me to come in and work something out which I ended up going back in their unfortunately when I went back it was a lot of lies a lot of changing numbers and different APR‘s. At the end of the day and 4 days wasted  of dealing with them and all their lies I walked out such a very bad experience. Please review your paperwork please look at your numbers before you sign anything they change numbers and APR‘s to get the best deal for themselves",1.0
45,"November 26, 2018","Bought a new 2018 Rouge, it had a scratch on a fender and two stains. They said they would fix them. They did after about two weeks later. I asked if they would tint the front windows for having to wait but their finance manager,J D said that only if I gave them  a thousand on a survey so I said no cause they, finance, didn't treat me good.  Never had so much trouble with a dealership. But it starts from the top. Emailed Chase Cooley and never got an answer. Never buying there away. Salesman Chad was awesome. He even offered to pay for my disable plates cause Babatunde got me regular plates. ",4.2
46,"November 21, 2018","The business practices here are shady at best. I was helping someone find and purchase a car, and the sales manager, Demetrius, ended up saying he wanted to help me out in return. I said that I doubt it is free, but he insisted to not worry about it. I had my wisdom teeth pulled a few days before, so I was focused on the pain to make it less significant. This made it to where I didn't think to ask certain questions, and it allowed the manager to have shady business. He said I had 3 days to return the Nissan Sentra if I didn't want it and to leave my Chevy Sonic there for a possible purchase on the dealership's or his end. I am not sure which one he was trying to do. He still sent me to the finance department to sign the contract while saying that the contract would be redone with my ""trade in"" on it. These combined parts led me to believe that it was not finalized. I ended up getting a call from him the next day saying that there was good news, but I stopped him because I didn't want to go through with this anymore. I felt like something would happen and that I was being screwed over. I tried to return the Nissan Sentra two days after my visit, and I was told that the contract I signed was finalized. The finance person working with me was going to help me get a check for my Sonic to give me time while helping to sell it. I waited a long time to ever see the check, and the finance person that worked with me changed locations. I came back to try to get the check and my car. The sales manager that screwed me said the GM had the key for my Sonic and that the GM was gone for the day. I gave it some more time because I was told that I would be contacted to get my car back. I never was. I finally saw the check when I contacted their facebook messenger. I was led from phone number to phone number in reference to finding my car. I ended up getting in contact with the original finance person that helped me. They told me that the car was in the back of the dealership and they would contact me when the dealership finds the keys. It has been since November 10th that they have been ""looking"" for them. It makes me believe that the dealership could be lying and scrapped my car. I am beyond frustrated and have been patient long enough.",1.0
47,"July 06, 2018","I’ve traded my vehicle in, and I’ve called twice to check the status of canceling my service contract. The first time I called over a week ago... still no response! I called to day and the receptionist transferred me to a voicemail. I called back and didn’t even get answered by the receptionist. The phone rang, it sounded like someone picked up the phone and hung up. Very disappointed! They are only responsive when they want to make a sale.... but after that you are on your own! The receptionist has always been not so friendly though!",1.0
