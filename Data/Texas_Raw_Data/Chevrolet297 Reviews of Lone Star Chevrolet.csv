1,"April 13, 2020",This was by far my best car buying experience yet. The staff in every department was very friendly and helpful. In fact I did not meet a single person that did not make me smile.

4,"December 28, 2019","Front receptionist and staff were very friendly and welcoming (ONE STAR). We received the car we wanted (ANOTHER STAR).

Reason for lack of 3-STARS experience (time, salesmanship, and  overall experience).

We are pleased with the car; however, the process was not pleasant.",1.6
5,"November 29, 2019","Worst service department ever! We bought a certified pre owned truck. The roof started leaking immediately. Brought it back to service department, we were told it would be priority to get it fixed. At this time the truck has been there for 1 week at they haven’t touched it yet. I am making payments on a truck that I don’t even have possession of.",1.0
6,"September 09, 2019","This review is for Robert Jones thank you for making my trip from Cali to Texas buying experience a great one!
I don't like going into dealerships because of the games that are generally played by the dealerships. I worked with Robert Jones, told him what type of truck I was searching for and he made it happen. When I was ready to find out my options Robert, provided the necessary comparable information I was searching. No hassle, no playing of games but straight business and we closed the deal in less than 45 minutes.  ",5.0
7,"August 15, 2019","Traded in a Subaru to this dealership and instead of taking the value of it off the price of the car I bought from them, they added it to the price somehow. They sold a warranty that the car wasn't eligible for. The car broke down the next day. Had to beg for them to take it back. Mix Coco, the GM, is a nut case maniac.",1.0
8,"August 01, 2019",Do not go to Lone Star service department!  Took my ‘15 Silverado in for a noise in the front end. I was told they knew exactly want it was (shaft just needed to be greased...140.00). Then I get a call saying it too late for the shaft the whole gearbox needs to be replaced (2400.00). Thinking that was the problem I tell them to go ahead.  I pick the truck up and it’s still making the same noise. So looks like I was shafted out of 2400.00.  I take it back and the they say they fixed it by tightening a bolt.?.  I pick it up and It’s still making the noise so I take it back again.  I have been there 5! times and it’s still making the same noise.  The last time they said both front struts were loose and that was the problem. It’s still making the noise so were they really loose??? Or did they just tell me that.  I will say they are saying they will fix it at no charge because I’ve already paid 2400.00 for NO REASON but it’s still very aggravating.  I would like to take it to a different dealer but then I will have to pay all over again.  I would be willing to just call it a loss if they would reimburse me SOMETHING. ,1.4
9,"July 11, 2019","Purchasing a used car.  Our bank will give us a much better interest rate so we were going with them. They had already run our credit which 800+.  Our bank called them and told them we were pre-approved also, but would take a couple of days for the check to get to them. We we putting $6k down.  They would not hold the truck with our $6k and pre'approval from our bank.  They INSISTED we finance through them!!  This is a bad way treat customers.  Rest assured if I was buying a new car I would be going somewhere else!  ",1.3
10,"June 20, 2019","Mark makes life so much easier and is so knowledgeable about my vehicle.  I feel very comfortable bringing my truck to him.   I don’t trust a lot of dealerships especially the service departments, but this one is by far the best!  ",5.0
11,"April 09, 2019","I called ahead of time to make sure the wait wasn’t long. I showed up and there was only one person in front of me In line but they had already been helped. I had my dad come and pick me up and we had to wait about 20 to 30 minutes just to be checked in. There were eight people standing there (including service reps) just standing there talking and no one would help me.  A service rep, I believe his name is James,  checked me in and asked me why I was there that day and I told him that I needed an oil change I wanted to possibly get new windshield wipers, get some air in my tires and to take a look at my coolant levels because they were a little low.  I noticed a couple of days later that my car was still low on coolant and I had to go to the gas station before work at six in the morning to get coolant. I paid $75 for an oil Change and new windshield wipers, When I could’ve done the job myself for half the price. Not to mention that I had to pay $15 at a gas station for coolant which made me late to work. I paid a higher price for better customer service and I was extremely disappointed. I get better service at Firestone or autozone. I have purchased two cars at your location and I have never been serviced so poorly before. Perhaps it was all done  no rush since I dropped my car off at noon,  but I called before hand to make sure it was OK.  I called and spoke to James today and he stated he will ask around and see what happened. I drove about an hour to come drop off my car for service last time. How about you refund me for the crappy service? I’ve been a loyal customer for 8 years now and your service has unimproved. ",1.2
12,"February 12, 2019","I bought a new Chevy equinox and had a beyond horrible experience.  He didn’t give me the trade value I was promised, didn’t give me the warranty I asked for, and didn’t give me the price on the car we agreed on.   What we agreed to verbally was not what was printed on the invoice/paperwork.   It took him over 5 hours to do the paperwork and financing because he did it for the wrong car then had to redo it.  After getting home  and realizing what happened he turned disrespectful and rude.  Making comments like “you can’t have your cake and eat it too”. “ it’s not my fault you didn’t read the fine print”.  Refusing to take the car back after I had driven it maybe 10 miles.  I tried contacting the sales manager, general manager and other sales men to help me and NONE of them returned my emails or calls.  I would not recommend this dealership to my worst enemy they are con artists.  Just check their yelp reviews they have 1-2 stars out of 5.  Worst dealership I have ever seen.",1.0

14,"January 23, 2019","Johnny and Ian gave me a great deal on a 2019 High Country.  Very easy to work with and absolutely no high sales pressure.  My trade in was only 8 months old, but the 2019 had enough changes that I had to have it.  Now I’m thinking about the next having a 6.2, hope I can wait longer this time.",5.0

I recently bought my first new vehicle- a diesel chevrolet colorado, and mike thomason was the best salesman I could have hoped for. he was honest, upfront, and made sure I understood how to use all the electronic stuff that my truck came with. At no point did I feel like I was getting jerked around for a few extra bucks which is not something I can say for some of the other houston dealerships I spoke to.  Thanks Mike.",4.8

17,"November 30, 2018","It had been exactly 3 years since I was last inside this dealership. In November, three years ago, I purchased a brand new 2015 Camaro thanks to my fun sales man Sid Feliciano. Although only a V6, it was an upgrade from my then 4 cylinder. I drove that car around proudly. Love at first sight!

Fast forward 3 years and here we are November 2018. I am truly blessed to have been given the opportunity to sit with my sales person Andy Strokos this time around. I am now the proud owner of a 2018 Camaro 2SS. Can someone say V8?! This dealership has made me fall in love not once, but TWICE!   So blessed and happy. Customer Service is awesome all the way around. Jorge Esquivel was a riot and had us laughing. Team Chevy for many years to come! ",5.0
18,"November 19, 2018","I brought my 2016 Camaro SS for service due to shudder in the transmission, secretly noted down the mileage on the odometer and it reads 7,030 miles. Asked the service advisor when they going to finish the job, said two days. After two days I took my car at Lonestar Chevrolet and got surprise the odometer now reads 7,230 exact 200 miles. They're joy riding my car for 200 miles which I hardly drive my car to preserved it. I strongly don't recommend this service center specially if you have a nice sporty car. If ever you do service your car in this dealership take a printout copy of the pre-service report and double check the actual odometer mileage in your car versus the printout odometer reading.",1.7

He was able to provide me a very clear and competitive price for the vehicle and this price was upheld once I actually arrived as the dealership. 

The folks at Lone Star were exceptionally friendly all-around and made my purchase experience go very smoothly. I had feared getting into a long-winded runaround with the Finance and Insurance associate, but they were actually very understanding of my buying needs and did not create any stressful hurdles in the purchasing process.

I was told that the problems it was having were ""normal"". Again, joke is on me. My car continued to have problem after problem. Needles to say, my car has been in the shop almost more than I have had it. This last time I had it in the shop, they had my car for ""28 days"", almost a month. I got a call telling me that they could not find the problem. Mind you this is after I had taken a video to show them exactly what my car was doing. I showed it to the ""HEAD"" service manager and he said, ""Oh yes, I hear exactly what you are saying and I promise we will get it fixed before we return it to you."" Now, I hear this noise ""EVERY TIME"" I start up my car, but they couldn't find it in ""TWENTY EIGHT"" days. What a joke. I would never recommend purchasing a car from this dealership and I would recommend the service department even less if that's possible. 

I tried to get GM to take it back as a lemon, but of course they said, ""You didn't start having the problems soon enough."" REALLY! What a joke. Stay away from here. I wish I had read the reviews on this place before I purchased a car from them. LESSON LEARNED!",1.3

184,"September 02, 2013","I am ready to buy a Grand Sport Corvette.  I have only test drove a base model preowned and a Centennial 2012 Preowned one but found the one i wanted in color and options at LoneStar.  Let me preface this by, I am buying this car in cash with simply 1 Month Commission check i got.  Not trying to brag, but you will understand the point in a second.   I walked into this dealership wearing shorts, addidas tennis shoes and a texan tshirt.  The Sales Manager, stereotyped me 100% as a person who did not have the funds for such a vehicle.  I am at a Chevy dealership not something of major significance.   I was told in order to test drive the vehicle, i would need to fill out sales forms as if i was going to buy it.  I was completely stereotyped.  Never had this happen to me even at a porsche, bmw or mercedes dealership.  The sales rep informed me that there are a lot of people who want to drive this vehicle and cannot afford it and corvette owners want to keep miles low.  This is a standard 2013 Grand Sport Corvette msrp $69K, NOT some over $100K vehicle of significance .  I will NEVER allow people to stereotype me or anybody and felt insulted.  I have heard Lonestar Management is known for being cocky, because they sell the most vehicles etc.., but I will not stoop to that level.  Stereotyping is bad, regardless.  I told the rep, i was gone, and went into the Sales Manager offfice and nobody looked up and asked if i needed help etc.., so i simply said, ""the rules for test driving cars is ridiculous"", the Sales Rep, did not even acknowledge me by looking up and said, ""sorry, that is the way it works"".  I walked out with a few words i am not too proud of, but have never been treated like this by a ""sales"" manager.  Sales to me means customer service, this guy should not have the words sales in his title.  He is nothing more than a paper pushing jerk.  I told a few folks about this at the front and they both looked at each other and said ""he is talking about xxx""  They knew exactly who i was talking to.

I asked to speak to the GM and he came out and gave me lip service of ""yes sir"" ""sorry sir"" etc.., but did not fix the situation.  The GM seemed like a nice guy but could have easily won me over by apologizing and fixing the problem.  Instead he and the sales rep (who was useless) kept telling me that ""Corvette owners don't like miles put on the vehicles and will complain about a vehicle if miles are on them"" etc..  The bs part of this is if i would have filled out the forms and ""proved"" i could buy the car, they would have let me test drive it.  It was nothing but stereotyping because i came in with casual clothes and look young.

Bottom line is, i will be buying a Vette or a Porsche 911and it will not be from Lonestar Chevrolet.  There is NO car worth allowing for this behavior to happen.  a $69K vehicle is not something of major importance to allow this to happen.  The ""sales"" manager is a cocky jerk and Lonestar stereotypes people.  I will be following this up with the BBB and with Corporate GMC/Chevy.  People like this should not be interacting with customers.",1.5

Now, to my latest experience...this will be a huge shock to anyone who does not call this dealership their dealer of choice.  My girlfriend lives all the way down in League City, and has a 2007 GMC Yukon XL.  A few weeks ago, the transmission cratered on her, and she called the dealer down there that she bought several vehicles from over the years and has had all her service done.  GM has a 5 year 100,000 mile powertrain warranty, and her Yukon was under on miles, but just a few months over on time.  ""Her"" dealer refused to help her out at all!!!!  I was blown away that they were not going to take care of her.  I called into Lone Star, and spoke to Josh Campbell (Service Manager), and told him the situation.  He said: ""Get that Yukon up here to us, and we will take care of her"".  So, we brought her truck 60 miles up from the Bay area, and sure enough, Josh and Mike got GM to do a ""Good Will"" warranty repair on the transmission, and also took care of a few other issues for us!!!!

About 8 hours later Michael called me at home to give me an update on the progress of the repair and said my van would be ready the next day. I might add at this point that I use my van for my business and without it, I'm not able to work. Michael understood this. The next day Michael called and said my van was ready to go. Considering they had to change the transmission torque converter and completely service the transmission during the process, I was extremely satisfied with their service. This is my second time using this dealership in three years. Each time, Michael Duffy and the mechanic did an excellent job. You can bet I'll continue to use them in the future.

214,"July 24, 2011","I am hopeful that the following comments will be taken as constructive and Lone Star will give serious consideration to re-evaluating the way they do business. Keep in mind this recent purchase from Lone Star is a second one in a year. We have been pleased with the Service Department's and the overall friendliness extended by most members of the dealership.

As to your survey: Since the last question of your survey does not provide and optional answer of ""Maybe"" I provided a ""No"" response. It is with reservation that I would recommend this dealership for a primary reason. That being that any prospective buyer should very carefully read and thoroughly understand the way Lone Star advertises in the paper its ""Incredible Offers!"" and the very,very fine print at the bottom of the advertising page. The actual ad we responded to (dated July 16, 2011)implies in bold type that a prospective buyer we receive $11.95 oil changes, 2500 milies of gas, and No Pymts Till Halloween. Guess what, surprisingly, the $11.95 oil change is a definite given. However, not once did the sales rep mention that the 2500 miles of gas and no payments till Halloween was applicable to our purchasing a vehicle. As a result of this experience it's clear the ad was a cleverly written baiting promotion to bring people in. Most likely the only people who benefit from those ""offers"" are the ones who pay a premium price for a Lone Star vehicle.The fine print at the bottom that states, ""Advertised Prices Cannot be Combined With Any Other Offers"" is purposely vague and cannot necessarily be connected with the ""Incredible Offers!"" in bold print a the top. 

In my opinion, the manner in which the ad is displayed could easily be perceived as a ""deceptive ploy"" and falls in the category of being an unethical business practice.
Given all the enormous details Lone Star management has developed to ensure customer satisfaction I believe it has overlooked a very important component in the method used to entice prospective customrs to the dealership. As a result of our most recent experience my wife and I are very disappointed. Again, I am hopeful you take these comments as a business perspective and not personal.

Robert (salesman) is not out for his biggest profit possible; he's there for the best deal possible for the customer. Craig (finance) really did a great job getting us the best rate possible (which was 0%). The fantastic warranty options were explained in depth but was not a long drawn-out, boring process. He was able to provide what we needed and then some. 

Both Robert and Craig gave us the best deal, with the best warranties, at the best finance rate and just an overall good feeling. Buying a vehicle is a large investment and you want to make sure you're making the right decisions. Thanks to the folks at Lone Star Chevrolet, we didn't have to worry about that.

233,"March 03, 2011","Liars.  Stated they had a Volt to sell that had ""already been ordered"" and ""goes to production this week"".  Both statements were intentional lies to get me to order the car.  To this date the car has not been given a production slot by Chevrolet, despite the promises it had already been given one previous to the date I signed my order.  Also, I was promised that if anything happened to the mid-March delivery date I could cancel the order and get my deposit back.  When I learned the car would not be produced as promised and requested a refund, Josh Harris called me and told me my refund was ""already approved"".  When I arrived at the dealership to have my credit card credited, Craig Kabzinski refused to refund my deposit.  Nothing but lies and deceit from this dealership.

239,"September 11, 2010","I was looking for a 2010 pickup, with specific colors and option sets in mind, and of course for the right price.  2010 choices were getting scarce.  I worked with Michelle Shepard for nearly a week looking for a truck that met my criteria.  We checked into any number of trucks listed on GM's available inventory site only to find then them either already sold, or the dealer they were located with had added  additional extras that were of no interest to me.  Michelle was on top of the process, and even when we were inquiring into a particular truck (or two), she kept working to find additional options.  After nearly a week and lots of patience, we ultimately found exactly what I was looking for.  It was delivered from the other dealer, and prepped for me to pick up.  

The financing process with Bradley was as quick and painless as could be expected.  All available options were presented, matter of factly with no pressure to purchase any, and costs (total and monthly payment) were presented for various options I was looking at along the way, including with no options.  It was a decent process.

Marie handled the review of features for the vehicle, going over OnStar, the options I purchased, etc.  It's been many years since I have purchased a new vehicle, and the features, to me, were a lot to take in.  Marie helped me with any question I had.

The only issue I have had to this point is that my OnStar system is apparently not configured correctly, and I'll need to take the truck back in to have that corrected.  Assuming it is the quick config change that was described, there are definitely worse things in life.  

I've had the truck for 24 hours at the time of this note, and so far, I've been VERY happy with the vehicle, and the purchase process.

I recommend all my family and friend to buy vehicles at Lone Star and have not heard one bad thing about their experience.  ,5.0
283,"June 10, 2010",Lone Star Chevrolet gives honest straight forward answers without alot of the regular run around. We had shopped at a close by GMC dealership and were jerked around for 2 weeks on a truck. I talked my son into going to where I normally get my vehicles from which is Lone Star Chevrolet and were treated with respect and honesty. We purchased him a truck in the time it took to get the run around at the GMC dealership. Michelle Shepherd is a great sales person that knows her product and is extremely helpful. We have since purchased another truck thru her and that brings it to 3 in the last year.,5.0

285,"June 09, 2010","My husband and I were in search for a new Tahoe and had visited many local Houston area dealers but none compared to the quality Lone Star Chevrolet provided us.  Robert Martin is a phenomenal salesman and provided us with exceptional customer service and professionalism.  He always answered our questions with the utmost respect and patience and for that, we will continue to buy from him in the future as well as recommend him to others who are in search of a Chevy vehicle.  The owner is also very friendly and keeps her facility clean and hires only the most professional staff members.  All in all, a delightful experience and we would recommend this dealership and Robert Martin to anyone!",5.0
286,"June 09, 2010","I was lookingfor a very specific configuration of car.  Michelle found it for me in a day. 
She gave a better price than I expected. They worked with me to get financing from who I wanted and at a good rate. 
Also were great with perks for service, which I have yet to use butknow it will be a good 
experience.  ",5.0
287,"June 09, 2010","Ted Dowell at Lone Star Chevrolet is always been a pleasure to do business with.  He listens to my needs and helped me find the perfect car at a great price.  The transaction was seemless and professional.  I recommend anyone looking for a new or used car to contact Ted Dowell @ Lone Star Chevrolet, Houston, TX.",5.0
288,"June 09, 2010","Pulling into Lonestar Chevrolet, we knew we wanted to buy a new 2010 Camaro, but still wasn't sure what dealership we would go with. We started looking at the Camaros which were out near the feeder street at the front of the dealership, at least 100 yards from the showroom or any salesman. I doubted any salesman would walk that far out in the heat of the day. But I was wrong, Craig Kabzinski came right out and asked if he could help. I had a ton of questions...not to mention I wanted to test drive one of the new Camaros....5 minutes later I was in a bad-a** Black Camaro with my foot to the floor for a real test drive...theres nothing like the smell of burning rubber in the HOT Texas sun! ... 'for an old bald guy, you look pretty hot' said my wife! 

About 2 hours later, I was signing the paperwork for my new Black 2010 Camaro SS RS. But it gets better. Not only were we pleased with the knowledge and attention, but more importantly, the friendliness of the entire dealership. So pleased in fact, we bought two Camaros....yep, his and hers. And she looks hotter than me in her own new Lonestar Chevy Camaro!

Lonestar could not have been more helpful, friendly and professional. If you have a problem with this dealership, you may want to look in the mirror first because this is a first class dealership, from sales to service.",5.0
289,"June 09, 2010",This was by far the best experience I have had purchasing a new car.  Michelle was recommended to me by several family members that had previously purchased vehicles through her.  She answered all my questions and was very helpful the entire time I was I was with her.  Michelle has definitely earned my recommendation and my business in the future.,5.0
290,"June 09, 2010",Our family has purchased 3 trucks so far and the service has been excellent every time. Any issues were handled by sales staff and service staff immediately. Would highly recommend using this dealership and continue to do business with them in the future with Michelle as our sales representative.,5.0
291,"June 09, 2010","After puchasing 3 vehicles and 2 transmissions replacedin the last few years It became obvious that the service department was not able to seryice vehicles,and they waste customers time. I have requested that they remove me from all solicitation which I was assured was going to be done per Joseph Healy on 02-17-2010 .I was left alone for a month or so now I am being bombarded again with email junk I tell all my friends not to buy a vehicle from lonestar chevy. lonestar chevy LEAVE ME ALONE I WILL NEVER BE YOUR CUSTOMER..",1.2
292,"June 09, 2010","I have never purchased a brand new vehicle before.  I have always bought used vehicles, but I have had many deals with large (and small) dealerships.  I will say my experience at Lone Star Chevrolet was wonderful.  I had my wife and 2 young children with me, and they felt comfortable hanging out in the dealership that was very well setup to work with families.  We really appreciated the hospitality and courtesy from all the Lone Star Chevrolet staff.  

My goal was to find a white Silverado crew cab 4x4 Z71 in my price range.  I couldn't find one in ALL of the Houston area.  Robert Martin had me coming in to see the a truck that meat all my needs, but it was silver.  I had told him silver was good too, but he remembered my 1st choice was white.  The morning I was scheduled to come meet with Robert he called me to let me know he was looking at a newly delivered truck that met my specs AND was white.  Needless to say I was excited.  I appreciated that greatly.  I know many other dealers would have tried to sell me the silver truck instead of white (because white is a very popular color) - and then tried to move the white truck to a new buyer.  Robert put MY wants and desires 1st.  That is very appreciated and I will highly recommend Lone Star Chevrolet (and Robert Martin) to anyone looking to buy a new vehicle.

Thank you again for your excellent service.

293,"June 09, 2010",Harry Doggett spent way more time with me than another sales person would have. He worked with me tirelessly to get me the car I loved and the price I needed to make it work. Harry and the service manager cared even after I purchased my car to make sure I was happy and everything they promised me had bee completed. ,5.0
294,"June 09, 2010","Lone Star was fantastic with my car buying experience. As a veteran I used the preferred dealer network with USAA. The price was outstanding and made the overall process quick easy and without issue. Michelle was very informed and answered all of my questions. The customer is first business model is excellent and should be commended. More Dealerships should adopt this way of doing business. I will definitely recommend Lone Star and Michelle to anyone who is looking for a new car. As a veteran it means the world to me that we have access to programs such as yours. 

Sincerely,

295,"June 09, 2010","Michelle did an excellent job.  She was understanding of what type of vehicle I was looking for, and had selected some vehicles for my review prior to my arrival at the dealership.  Also, the gentlemen within the Finance department was extremely helpful.  Unfortunately, two months after the fact I cannot remember his name.  Overall, I was extremely satisfied with all the help I received at the dealership and afterward.  Thanks again!",5.0
296,"June 09, 2010",Not only would I recommend this dealership; I have recommended this dealership to people looking for a vehicle and recommended they work with Michelle Sheppard. She's great.
