0,"May 16, 2017","I have bought 6 new pickups from them so far. I purchase a new truck every 24 months.  In 2016 I purchased two new pickups from Sour Lake Ford and they exceeded my expectations on both.  I had a brain hiccup and thought I would shop another dealership but came to my senses and went back to Sour Lake Ford.  They almost doubled my trade in offer and still sold my trade in 3 days later, now imagine what the other dealership would have made off my trade in! The sales experience has been pleasant and rewarding.  They also have an excellent service department to take care of your needs after the sale.  These folks are the greatest and other folks may get tired of my bragging on them but for me there is only one Ford Dealership worth knowing, they feel like family!

If you decide to give them a try and I strongly suggest that you do,  There is one name you need to know and that is ROCKIE TEMPLETON!!  This lady is not scared of the big boys and will go to bat for you against anybody!!  When I drive up one of the other salesmen call her, they all know I only deal with ROCKIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",5.0

4,"July 17, 2012","Super easy car purchase. All done by telephone. Best price on Escape Limited in entire area. $1000 cheaper than Orange or Beaumont. No games or B.S. jusy straight up information and courteous answers to all my questions. 
 I had a very bad experience at David Self Ford in Orange....DO NOT DROP YOUR GUARD WITH THESE FOLKS, NUMBERS TEND TO CHANGE AT TIME OF FINANCE!!!BEWARE!!
 I called Truckville(Wednesday) after the experience and Doug Vanek answered the phone and made me a deal right their on the phone in 10 minutes. I told him I could not say yes or no at that moment but would call him back with an answer before closing time. 
 I did call back and accepted the offer, he found the exact Escape for my wife in the Dallas,Tx area and I took delivery on Friday. 15 minutes to fill out paperwork and another 15 just ""shootin' the breeze."" 
 A truley great car buying experience. Highly recommend. I will give them another opportunity to sell me my next truck purchase.

                        Thanks, Ronnie (Orange,Tx)",5.0
