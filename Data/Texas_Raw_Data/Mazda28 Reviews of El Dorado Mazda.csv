0,"June 07, 2018","I originally went in to window-shop some used Mazda 3s, but Darian Cunningham was able to find a NEW Mazda 3 in my price range and it was a no-brainer. Came back later that evening go do paperwork and was out of there in no time. Tommy in Finance literally wrote out all of their warranty programs and add-ons and made it very easy to see which ones were going to be useful and which weren’t.  

Later, there were some minor maintenance issues and we couldn’t quite agree on who was responsible for it. Mike Domenico helped out here and offered to take care of it, which was incredibly helpful. ",5.0
1,"March 27, 2018","On a rainy, cold night, I visited an amazing dealership that treated me with kindness, respect, and professionalism! My salesperson, Jonathan Clayton, was not only knowledgeable, but had a way of making me feel relaxed and well taken care of. I would highly recommend using El Dorado Mazda...rain storm or not!!!",5.0
2,"December 30, 2017","Sales manager bordering on outright lying about condition of the car I was considering buying. There was hail damage, huge scratches on the hood(another salesman told me they’d placed their Christmas decorations on the hood of this car; how stupid can you be. Somehow this left deep into the metal scratches). I’d had 4-5 conversations with the sales manager via email and text and he never mentioned once that these cars were damaged. When I went to the dealer to see the cars and realized they were damaged I confronted the sales manager and asked, Don’t you think you could have been honest in any of our 5 conversations and told me about the damage on the cars? His answer, I suppose I COULD have, but I didn’t. I told him he is the exact reason people hate car salesmen. He just shrugged. Bad vibe, bad ethics, bad cars, bad deal. Don’t do it. There are better places out there.",1.0
3,"July 14, 2017","I strongly recommend that you go elsewhere.  New car prices are 5-10% above other dealers, and you end up getting dismissive service.  I was expecting a small-town-service feel, but got condescension and snide remarks instead.  Ended up buying at Town North where Blake was awesome.",1.0
4,"July 02, 2017","It is clearly obvious El Dorado Mazda will not attempt to gain your business. I n their eyes, they are not Burger King, you take it their way or you don't get the @#$& thing.  

It is a shame I had to give even 1 star rating, there was not an option for less.  My wife put a $500 deposit for a Miata-RF with El Dorado Mazda and they would have to order it from Japan.  They estimated it would take about 12 weeks.  6  weeks passed and she thought she'd call them to see how it was progressing.  Their response was ""we thought you cancelled"".  Really?  Where did they get that?  They had no explanation for that answer.  In fact they never followed up, phone call, letter, email or otherwise.  I assume they just intended to forget about it and keep the $500.  We drove back to El Dorado Mazda to get a refund and she felt sorry for the old salesman who offered an non-sincere apology.  She let him ""try again"" with a promise that he would follow up with a phone call by Tuesday or at the very latest on Wednesday (that conversation was on Friday).  I made him repeat it to me twice that he was going to follow up and even said ""I expect a follow up call by Wednesday at the latest"" (5 days later).  He repeated it and apologized again.  It is now Friday and we've not heard a thing from El Dorado Mazda.  I called this afternoon and asked why he hadn't followed up with the phone call as promised.  He said ""we can't get you that car"".  I asked why hadn't he followed up.  He just apologized.  I told him his apologies mean nothing and that is word means nothing to us anymore.  We'll be returning to El Dorado Mazda Monday for a refund.  

It is obvious now that El Dorado Mazda's intent is to sell you what they have on hand, and put fourth no effort to get the car you're looking for.  I am not one to give in to their sales pitch and accept what they have.  

There are dealerships out there that appreciate your business, El Dorado Mazda IS NOT one of them.

We ARE going to get the exact car we want, but it will be a cold day in #$%^ if we ever return to El Dorado Mazda or any of its affiliates.

5,"May 29, 2017","I stopped by to look at and test drive one of their used vehicles. The salesman seemed nice, but from the moment I started the test drive to the moment I walked out of the dealership, the ""seemingly nice"" salesman was smug and condescending. I went in expecting to negotiate, but once I sat down and tried to get a better price, the salesman stated the car was priced to sell and that I wouldn't get a better deal, but I tried anyway because their website never claimed to be a no haggle dealership. As we continued, the way he talked to me - his tone, phrasing, mannerisms - and the questions he asked, he tried to make me feel guilty for even trying to get a lower price or more for my trade-in. I asked for an OTD price and he wrote one down and asked for a signature. I was about to sign but I asked one more clarifying question about any other fees. He made a comment about me being too serious - maybe he thought he was being funny - but it came off as condescending and insulting, so I walked out. Negotiating may not be fun, but even if I was asking for something unreasonable, the salesman didn't have to be jerk about it. There are plenty of other dealerships around that will treat me kindly and respectfully. I won't give a salesman business after he insults me. ",1.5
6,"May 04, 2017","Pros: The salesman was very nice and polite. Went on test drive and he was informative. I give him high marks there. 

Cons: Let me just start off by saying purchasing a car is a business decision. Two parties being able to come to an agreement on price and terms of contract. At the end of the day we did not purchase.
We could not agree on price. Where I have my ""beef"" is the ridiculous pricing on a HAIL DAMAGED car. MSRP was pretty much accurate on the initial sales. They came off 5000.00. But then they added highly inflated other fees. It wasn't a good deal at all. At their price I could have bought an undamaged car. On any hail damaged car there is an inherent risk so buyer beware.
 I ended up purchasing my car at Freeman Mazda in Irving. I should have gone there in the first place. I was trying to not have to drive into Dallas at all. I live 80 miles away. It was worth the drive into Irving. Night and day experience. Bought car with no hail damage for BELOW invoice. Saved over $3000. ",2.3
7,"March 24, 2017","Wish I could give a 0. They messed up my tire while fixing a recall. Total bad experience, the guy called and tried to trick me into buying two new tires before I got back, if you go and get Nick as your tech I am truly sorry.",1.0
8,"November 16, 2016","I just bought a new Mazda 3 Hatch.  I went in looking for a 2016 but was steered toward a 2017 with a lower cost and more options.  It seemed to good to be true but it wasn't, the 2017 had less dealer add ons and was a better fit.  So after a few days to work things out I threw a Wrench in it and told them I wanted a different color other then white.  Wade took a day and ended up finding one of the colors my wife wanted (blue) so I went in and after looking at it told him The wife wanted the original color and he rolled with it.  When I put them side by side I decided to go with the blue color because I thought it poped more and he was ok with that as well.  I asked him which one he liked and to his credit he picked the blue color.  I tell you all this to show you I was a picky customer and they gave me no hassles.  The blue color car was actually cheaper then the white one so I was surprised he wasn't trying to talk me into the more expensive one.  

The negotiations did have a give-and-take feel as most car dealers do but I don't feel like I got raked over the coals.  The finance person was straight forward and knowledgeable for the 20minutes I was in there.   

Overall I got quick, polite answers to my emails and polite service the two times I was on site.  They even offered to drive the car to Uptown Dallas so my wife could test drive it, if I wanted.  ",5.0
9,"September 07, 2016","This review is based on two factors: our experience working with salesman, Jairon and the financial department.

Jairon was delightful to work with, his customer-service oriented attitude was refreshing and impressive after our experiences with other dealers. He was professional, answered our questions with patience, even walked us through the financing process after it was his time-off. We definitely highly recommend that anyone whose interested in buying a Mazda to work with him. We would totally give him 5 stars.

However, we are taking one star off due to the awful experience working with the financing department. We would like to warn other buyers to be prepared for the disrespectful and rude treatment they will receive from the financing department.",4.0
10,"March 14, 2016","Yesterday I met with Sean T about a 2016 Mazda Six.   Sean is an army veteran with excellent product knowledge and is very likable.  I received a strong lease deal and a fair trade-in value on my car.  The sales manager, Mike, was also straightforward and shared with me various lease strategies which were helpful as I've never leased before.  The two finance folks were very pleasant, professional and helpful.  I never felt pressured or misguided.   I also like my new Mazda 6 touring very much",5.0
11,"May 03, 2015","If I could give zero stars, I would. Do not under any circumstances shop at this dealership. We test drove several models and decided on a CX-5, but the specific trim and color we wanted wasn't in stock. Before we left the dealership the salesman offered an overnight demo of the vehicle, which sounded great. 

However, when we called to take him up on the offer, the story changed. We were told we had to agree to purchase terms before we could take the demo. In all my years of vehicle buying, I've never encountered that demand for a longer test drive. 

I knew then we were dealing with a less-than-awesome sales manager, but the salesman was nice so we told him to get the car we wanted, and that we'd be in the next day to buy it. He said that was no problem, but that he had the same car but with more options that he'd sell us for the same price. We declined because we knew it would still cost more than the model we actually wanted after the deal was made.

The next day, we arrived at the dealership to buy the correct vehicle and were told they hadn't gotten it after all, again because we hadn't agreed to purchase terms. When the salesperson called us *the same morning* he made no mention that locating the car would require us to agree to purchase terms. But, he said, he still had that higher-spec model and he could make us a great deal. I found it odd they were trying so hard to push us into that upgraded model. More on that in a minute.

Here is a summarized set of things they actually said to me:

""Well, we didn't get the car we told you yesterday we'd get because you haven't agreed to purchase terms yet.""

""But we have one with more options we'll sell you for the same money. It's a great deal! Oh, and, um...it's hail damaged.""

As I storm out of the building...

""Why are you being rude and leaving like that? We'll repair the hail damage...""

As we (furiously) walked to our car for a fast escape away from these low-life's, we passed the ""great deal but hail-damaged"" vehicle. It was beat all to xxxx. Nearly every panel had golf-ball sized dents, some of which were in spots that would have required panels to be replaced. That was the vehicle they were doing everything they could to talk us into purchasing. 

Stay away from this god-awful dealership. They give all honest car salesmen a bad name. Please save yourself and anyone you know from being subjected to the worst customer service in North Texas.",1.0
12,"September 26, 2014","I love this place.  I have never had any issues with them.  Robbie in service and John and Tom in collision made me feel at ease knowing my car would be taken care of.  John made sure my car was towed back to McKinney after I was hit in Lewisville and from there, Tom made sure my car was taken care of.  they are the BEST!",5.0
13,"February 28, 2014","Edward, Robbie and Shaun were both fantastic. They negotiated with me and found me the car that I wanted and had it brought here for me. After the initial purchase of the car, there was an issue where the previous dealer's sticker was. I brought it to them and they took care of it and fixed it for me. They also dealt with my parents, who I brought with me, and they are hard customers! Their service and salesmanship was impeccable!  I would ABSOLUTELY reccommend this dealership to anyone!",5.0
14,"February 22, 2014","Edward was very nice, explained the vehicle--very knowledgeable, and they were willing to listen and try to help us.
Tommy was nice and very knowledgeable on the finance end, and he explained all the details.   Wish vehicle was even cheaper, but understand they do have to make some money.  Detailing and extra work was very good.    But they were willing to work with us, and think they gave us a good deal.

My wife loves the Mazda CX-5 so far.    Still adjusting to all the bells/whistles, and probably going to be awhile.    It drives wonderful and comfortable; several compliments on it.    Would have liked some options that other SUVS have:  back to raise with motion but raises easily; back seats to be able to recline like front seats, etc.    

Only had a week.....but Very Satisfied at this time!",5.0
15,"December 17, 2013",The sales lady was spectacular.  She was very informed about the automobiles-- able to answer all of our questions.  The manager was very helpful as well.  It was a great experience.  This is my second Mazda purchase from El Dorado.  It is a great dealership.  The service department is excellent as well.,5.0
16,"November 22, 2013",I called asking to see if they could find me a car to get me out of my car which I had a good amount of negative equity.I spoke with Shawn he said he would do his best and he did. The Team was able to get me out of my car and into a new Mazda 3 with a reasonable payment. Finance worked hard to get me a great rate and I was treated with respect and dignity.I am very happy with my new Mazda 3 it has great fuel economy and is fun to drive.,5.0
17,"November 11, 2013","Email I received almost 2 weeks after asking for a simple email telling me what sets them apart from their competition (since they were one of the front runners with Ford Escape Titanium). Incidentally, I was told I would receive an email the next day...

Dear Scott,

I just wanted to say thanks again for giving me the opportunity for your business here at El Dorado Motors.  I understand that we were working with you on a Mazda CX-5, but we were not able to earn your business this time.  However, moving forward, I wanted to assure you that if you were to need anything in the future, I am still here to help.  If any questions or concerns should arise, please feel free to contact me as I would be more than happy to assist you down the road.

Sincerely,

Edward Ruiz 

P.S.  If you know of anyone who is looking for a New or Pre-Owned vehicle, please give them my phone number, (972) 569-0101, and have them give me a call directly. 


My response...

Thanks for the email, but quite frankly I am disappointed. When we last spoke on the phone at 3:00 pm on the 28th of October, I had told you that I was at a decision crossroads on 3 vehicles and wanted you to sell me on buying a vehicle from you over the other 2 cars. You told me that while you were unable to do it that day you would the next without question.

I waited for something from you that never came. That actually made my decision easier as it narrowed the vehicles to 2...unfortunately your vehicle was originally one of my favorites, but your lack of follow through told me the one thing I needed to know...my business was not as important to you as you initially led me to believe. 

I actually purchased a new 2014 Ford Escape Titanium fully loaded from Sam Pack's 5-Star Ford in Plano from a sales person that went out of his way to demonstrate why they were the right choice...bar none.

FYI, we will not be referring business to El Dorado Mazda in McKinney for this very reason, and instead all referrals will go to Sam Packs's 5-Star Ford and Corey White.

I have yet to receive a response to my email, even though I included Shaun Schell, the Sales Manager in the distribution list.",2.3
18,"October 15, 2013","Our salesman David Sparling was super informative and helpful. He made our decision of purchasing our new vehicle that same day very easy and stress free.Even though we knew what vehicle we wanted and we had researched it, he pointed out many of the extras and accessories of the vehicle. He made sure that by the time we left the dealership with our new vehicle my daughter's phone was paired to the bluetooth and he explained and showed her how many of the extras worked. ",5.0
19,"October 08, 2013","Worst car buying experience ever!

Seriously. I bought several cars in my life, both in the US and abroad and although it wasn't always quick an easy, generally it was a good experience. All until I came to Eldorado Mazda. Talk about negative experience - you get it all here: bait and switch, rudeness, not returned phone calls, etc. They don't even bother being nice to you until you sign the deal.

To the details. When we first arrived to look at the car, we were greeted by Mr. Kilpatrick, who showed us few cars and took us out for a test drive, which was quite nice and informative. Although we liked the car, we didn't come to an agreement on price and left. Next morning I received a new lease quote from the sales manager and e-mailed him and Mr. Kilpatrick back agreeing to the new offer. In my return e-mail I spelled out all conditions, such as mileage, payments, etc. 

Upon arrival to the dealership, me and Mr. Kilpatrick looked the offer once again, initialed it and went to proceed with the paperwork. However, when I looked at the contract, it was quite different. When asked why the contract has changed, I was told that original offer was a mistake. Well, said I, then I wouldn't sign it, the deal is off. To which Mr. Kilpatrick replied that I knew about the mistake all along and intentionally kept silent to trick them into the deal. 

I believe, if parties do not agree on a contract, they just don't do business, its that simple. But accusing your customer of lying, especially after you initialed your own offer does not look like a very good idea to me. At this point Mr. Kilpatrick left me to resolve the problem with the finance manager. After all, the contract was signed on the conditions promised before.

This is not the end of story though. It took multiple phone calls and quite a bit of my time to ensure timely payoff for my old car and to get the license plates from the dealership. Honestly, I was so tired of them, I wasn't going to bother writing a review, but the license plates issue was the last drop. I e-mailed and called them multiple times with no response just to finally find out that the license plates and registration arrived to the dealership a couple of weeks ago and were just sitting there. Nobody bothered to let me know, just the same way they never bothered to make the car purchase pleasant to the customer.",2.0
20,"September 13, 2013",Edward really helped me buy the right car at a good price. He was patient when I seemed indecisive and represented me well to his management.,4.8
21,"October 09, 2012","My car is still under warranty I bought the 2 yr 100,000 miles well I've gone 15,000 miles an its October an I bought it in February so nowhere close to the warranty being out. The transmission is having trouble it's slipping that's what I took the car in for when I called I said there is not a light on when I took it in I said there is not a light on. When they called to tell me there diagnosis they said that the right strut is bent, it needed new tires, and an alignment an that would fix my transmission problems. I called a mechanic at another dealership that works on transmissions an he said there is no way that the tires are affecting the transmission take the tires off the transmission is still gonna run the same. I then called to place a complaint with the manager who was very rude, yelled at me kept interrupting me would not let me talk or get a word in edge wise. I would not take another car there to be serviced or buy another from there.",1.0
22,"April 14, 2012","After being asked for information such as interest rate, the sales person did not know what it was and had to go back and ask.  Seemed to lose interest in the sale as questions were asked (Jonthan) and Eric (one of the managers) on our way out, all he had to say was ...guess we could not get close enough. No one said come back, sorry we could not get closer or anything.  Rude, rude people.  Heard comments made by staff about other customers.  Would never go back there and will tell everyone I know not to go there.  There are a lot more Mazda dealerships in this are and this one left a very bad taste in my mouth along with the others with me.  Oh, and once Jonathan was told these terms were not going to work, his comment was OH and walked away.  Crappy dealership.",2.0
23,"May 23, 2011",The speed in which the serviced my car was incredible. I was in and out faster than I had ever expected. They completed the work in the time frame they stated to me! Thanks for not being pushy as well! I dread going to some places because they are so pushy to get you to buy extras. ,5.0
24,"March 24, 2011","Every trick in the book from this sales team.  I was lied to so many times during my encounter with this dealership.  They even pulled the ""checking your credit because of the Patriot Act"" -- I had my own financing so it was NOT required.  Lies, lies, lies.  No concept of professionalism.",2.0
25,"January 06, 2011","I recently leased a Mazda 3 and I'm not happy with this place. I am not coming back for service or anything else. I also removed their sticker from my car as soon as I got home to avoid helping them with free publicity.

I got a very good deal and they didn't scam me, but - I am a very well informed buyer, you can't scam me, period. Other than that - they didn't ""sell"" me the car, I bought it from them, despite them. I knew exactly which car I wanted, called before going and liked it, but the salesman Robert was terrible, short and rude; a few times he showed how frustrated he was, as if he really hated his job. The 2 sales managers were also pretty bad, one mistreating Robert in front of me as if that would make me feel better? And the other one, completely disengaged, as if he couldn't care less if you are there or not. Another sales person that helped me at the end of the transaction was nice, but completely clueless. The finance manager was very short and somehow rude as well. Honestly, If it wasn't that I wanted that car and I wouldn't find a similar unit anywhere else, I would have told them to shove it up their ***

My previous car buying experiences were at Subaru dealers (Subaru of Plano and Sewell Subaru) and boy, is there a difference!! Next time I hope to buy a Subaru again. ",2.6
26,"October 09, 2010",Cleaned us out on a lease. Being inexperienced we were bamboozled into a 4 year lease with 3k down on a $35k Vehicle.  Ended up being locked into a $600 payment. Do the math.  That's almost $30k paid for the lease.  Partially my fault for being an idiot. But I wont be fooled a second time. I hope others read this and are careful.  ,3.0
27,"August 17, 2009","This is the worst dealership I have ever been to.  Not only did they accuse me of lying about their misprinted ad, but when I came back to buy a vehicle they were so rude and disrespectful that I ended up walking out.  We agreed to a price over the phone and when I came in that was not the price I was offered.  I negotiated it down some and then told them I needed a few minutes to make some phone calls and make sure I was doing the right thing and getting a good deal, as this was my first time buying a car.  The sales manager kept trying to bully me into the deal and actually told me that if I didn't think it was a good deal that I could go to another dealership.  So I did.  I went to Hiley Mazda of Arlington, was treated respectfully, and bought a nicer car for the same price.  I will never go back to this dealership.",1.8
