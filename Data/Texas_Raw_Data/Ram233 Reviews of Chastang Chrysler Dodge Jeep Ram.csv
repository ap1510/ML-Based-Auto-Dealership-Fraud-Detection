12,"December 04, 2019","I took my 2018 Ram in to get the normal maintenance and also have them fix an issue with the gas pump clicking when the tank wasn't full, about every 2-3 dollars the fuel pump would click and this was happening at every gas station I went to. After a week they concluded the gas tank was bad and ordered a new one. On week 2 I called and they said it had just arrived and will get on it soon. Two days later I called again and they said that gas tank was for another truck and not mine. 3 weeks later I finally got the truck back with the same issue and now the Check Fuel Cap light is on! There was no communication at all, if I didn't call to get an update I wouldn't of heard anything from them at all. I will be taking the truck back again.",2.0

I liked the vehicle and decided to purchase it.  I had a trade in and it was evaluated and I received a very satisfactory offer.  The sales person insured that I received every incentive I was eligible for and came up with a nice offer that was completed without any pressure in less than 3 hours from start to finish.  This was absolutely...without doubt, the best vehicle buying experience in my life.  I've been buying cars since 1967...so that is something.",5.0
24,"November 02, 2019","We have nothing but positive things to say about Chastang Ford & especially Eli Ortega.  Eli did everything possible to make our sale easy, enjoyable & simple to understand.  Eli went out of his way to explain every detail.  Love that he has respect for his customers! 

We visited four other dealerships around Houston before coming to Chastang and we were very disappointed on how they all conducted business.  Chastang's transparency was a breath of fresh air.  If we could give then 10 stars we would! 

Thank you Eli & Chastang for the enjoyable experience.",5.0

29,"October 16, 2019",I’d been at this car buying exercise almost 2 weeks.  My mistake was not going to Chastang first!  There were no false promises or sideways talk just to get you in the door.

Being a shift worker I really appreciate how they catered to my awkward schedule and kept the whole process quick and clean!",5.0
36,"August 14, 2019","The Texas heat is hard on batteries. Very hard. The new cars depend on their batteries to do more. Not only to provide cold cranking amps but also to run the computers that control the systems and often to run the systems themselves. You may still put your foot on the accelerator but it is no longer connected by mechanical linkage to a carburetor instead it has a sensor that sends a signal to a computer that converts your intention into an action. The old days of jump starting or pulling a battery out of the nearest tractor to get you to the Western Auto are long gone. Even if you get your car to a shade tree mechanic you may have sinned in haste only to repent at leisure because when he is finished with it you may not be going anywhere.
Chastang has the diagnostic tools and the technicians to find the problem and the correct parts to fix it CORRECTLY - the first time! This is what they did Monday on our 2018 Pacifica and being able to wait in air conditioned comfort, with a complimentary beverage AND a charger for our cell phone [speaking of batteries] has sitting in a malodorous service station beat by a country mile.

37,"July 28, 2019","We purchased a new car with assistance from Dawn H.  She was very cordial and helpful for the entire process from test drive to final delivery of our new Challenger.  The rest of the staff was also friendly and made the purchasing process go rather smoothly and on the agreed upon schedule.  After experiencing some sales gimmicks and games from a big-city dealer, it was nice to get better and more honest service from my hometown dealer.  ",4.8

39,"July 17, 2019","Middle of July, AC on high I got a blast of hot air from the AC vent. My one year old Jeep was still under warranty so I drove to the closest service center, Chastang's. Their questions were detailed and professional helping me voice my concerns. They were able to take my Jeep that morning and gave me a lift home saying it might take two days to check it out. By the end of the day I got the call that the Jeep was ready to pick up. Not only was I impressed with the quick service but also with the fact that they read a ""review"" to me over they phone stating that my issue was common in very hot weather as the Jeep equalizes inside and outside air. They ran a few updates, checked out a host of systems, told the truth, that the cab AC filter was in good shape and not in need of replacement at this time and didn't charge me a DIME! How refreshing! Kudos to Chastang's! Keep up the great work!",5.0

46,"June 24, 2019","I live 3.5 hours away from Angleton.  I found the vehicle online and made the initial contact.  I was assigned to Eli Ortega, and he along with his manager handled everything through phone calls and email.  I test drove a similar pick up locally and made one trip to view this one.  Once the decision was made and the deal was reached, Eli and I scheduled the purchase.  I drove down to Angleton and everything was ready.  Don Conley took care of the financing portion.  All and all it took less than 20 minutes to sign all of the paperwork and get my new Ram 2500.  The folks at Chastang were very accommodating, especially given the distance.

Monday morning we got a call saying the deal didn’t go through and for us to come check the truck out. Carole our sales lady was very knowledgeable about all the features of my new truck, and worked very hard to get the deal done. Jay worked his magic with the numbers and Don was able to get us a good monthly payment. We signed papers and left that. The next day Don called said a lender came back with a better interest rate!!

Though I never planned to buy Dodge product because of my limited knowledge of its functonality and performance, but when I experienced such a great human relations and readiness to answer all my questions with patience and eagerness to  help at any given time, I  was convinced beyond doubt that Chastang dealership is a great auto dealer to patronize.

76,"February 12, 2019","took my ram 2500 to Chastang because i figured that since i bought my vehicle there they would show me more attention to bring me back, Boy was i wrong! i took my my truck in for an oil change and some recalls and a front wheel alignment, The oil change was part of my maintenance package that i purchase when I bought the truck so i guess that's why my fluids weren't  topped off usually when you take it anywhere else and pay for the oil change they topped off your fluids.
 then i got a phone call about a required AGR maintenance procedure that she said i had to do if not it was going to be really bad and they would have to go in there later and chisel out carbon built up in the throttle body of the vehicle, she said it had to be done no matter what. She didn't say it was optional.
it only costed about 1400.00 so i told her to do it, had i read about before and done my homework turns out i did not have to get it done and they could have bypass that code, 

its been a week since i got my truck back and now i have a change fuel filters light, add windshield fluid, and my brake fluid is low i would've thought that you have your vehicle service at a professional dealer so they can tell you these things even thou we are going to pay for it but no one advise me of this items, Its a shame that we cant not find a place that is willing to provide great customer service and that we can trust.  also forgot my service contract comes with a rental while it gets repaired so i get a call on Saturday at 10am and advise me that my vehicle is ready and if i dint pick up that day by 2pm it'll be 35 dollars a day, they should have the courtesy of notifying me a day before so i can make plans to pick up my truck that morning. She was so rude demanding me to pick the vehicle up that day. after i tell her my thoughts of it being wrong to expect me to pick up the vehicle with such a short notice she talk to her manager and got it work out, But on Monday i go pay the bill and notice they were charging me for the 3 days rental. They did credit the invoice but only because i said something if not i would have paid for it.",1.0

85,"January 21, 2019","Had fuel pump serviced late Nov 2018.  This work was not performed to a professional workmanship standard.  Less than two months later a fuel line connection necessary for the fuel pump service was not properly reconnected.  The connection separated while driving on the highway, spraying on the undercarriage and leaving me stranded at night in the rain.   If properly assembled, this connection will stay connected for the live of the vehicle.  Service dept admitted that the connection was not properly re-assembled at the time of the fuel pump repair.  The fuel line was correctly re-connected at no charge.  An apology and a ride back to the dealership to pick up the vehicle was all that was  offered, and I accepted both.  However, their mistake cost me two out of pocket tows and two days of lost income.  A small token of recognition for the inconvenience one causes another is customary in these situations.  Mistakes happen. The response to mistakes is what matters.",2.0

122,"September 08, 2018","This was my third visit to Chastang and I am extremely happy with the way they run their service department and their work on my 2008 Dodge Grand Caravan.  From calling in and getting to speak with Jackie the service manager, to getting after-service calls to check that everything went right, this is the place to bring your vehicle.

My first visit was back in September '17 when the upper heater hose had a leak.  Frustrated with the other place in town, I called Chastang on a whim and they were able to get me in AND had it ready the next day!  Wow....

My second visit was back in December '17 with a battery, wheel bearing, and oil leak.  They did their work quick, but had to wait on Don Davis to finally send over some previous service records and battery warranty info.....more on that later.

My most recent visit (September '18) was for a passenger front window regulator.  I made an appointment, brought it in late Monday, and received a call that is was done on Thursday.

I was a little hesitant to visit a 'small' Dodge dealership at first, thinking it would take a long time to repair.  Ever since the first visit they have treated me respectfully, had great communication, and treated me like they wanted my business.   I'll keep coming to Chastang.

My service and repairs previous to Chastang were through Don Davis.  Regardless of my need, Don Davis' service departments communication was near non existent, multiple calls to find out it wouldn't be ready, and downright rude at times, not to mention 2 weeks to fix a driver side window regulator - which only took Chastang a few days!  In addition, I brought in the Caravan to Don Davis over 5 times to fix a jerky transmission to which they said they couldn't fix and it was in 'range;' I didn't even mention this to Chastang, but after replacing the wheel bearing they also replaced a tie-rod and did some adjusting and the jerkiness is almost gone.   Way to go above and beyond! 

Don Davis completely lost my business.  Chastang all the way!!!

Do yourself a favor - drive on down to Chastang!",5.0

Eleven weeks into owning it and only 3200 miles it began at random vibrating to the point of feeling it thru the steering. Took it in, day one the service adviser tries to convince us it's normal. They set up an appt,and before the appointment the transmission messes up. After three days is shop they determine it needs a new transmission and then tells us that they have no idea when it will be in. Another 2 weeks in the shop and the transmission is replaced. We pick it up and head down the road and the same vibration is still there. Immediately we take it back. Chastang determined the cooling fan for the engine is out of balance and causing the vibration. Chrysler says because of stop start feature this is normal so Chastang offers NO MORE ASSISTANCE. They will gladly take your money though. Oh yeah, when all of this mess started , I had thought about trading it in for another vehicle there and Mike Norris offers me $11,000 less than what I paid for it only 3 months prior.

My total bill was $84.71, and thankfully I presented the service center with a coupon to have the final cost be $70.05.  I must admit that I've never paid this much for an oil change.  I was charged $17.00 for labor (I'm 62 years old, and I've never been charged labor for an oil change), and I was charged $9.45 per quart for the oil ($55.26 for 6 quarts of oil).  I priced checked synthetic oil online and and it's my opinion that I was overcharged for the oil and possibly the oil filter.  I would definitely not recommend taking any vehicles to this dealership for an oil change, or for any service.  Again, I'm greatly disappointed!!!

On a brighter note, while I was waiting on my jeep's oil change I visited with Liem regarding the purchase of a 2018 Jeep JL Wrangler Sport.  Liem was very professional and helpful.

I was greeted by a professional  ( can’t remember his name, sorry) who answered all may questions and said they would take care of me. I took my truck in and he was right..
