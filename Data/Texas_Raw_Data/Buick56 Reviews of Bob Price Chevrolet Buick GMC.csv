1,"March 01, 2019","Easy going, smooth, hassle free and a great deal on top of it!  Everyone we met were pleasant, welcoming and genuinely interested in giving us a great buying opportunity and experience.  Everyone we ran into said welcome or hi and asked if we were being taken care of.  Not only were they concerned while selling us our truck but even after the stress free finance dealings with George they introduced us to the Store Manager Lance and the service and parts guys in case we have any future needs.  They even pre-scheduled our first free maintenance visit.  If you like low pressure great service and a good Country style deal this is your kinda place.  We’ll be coming back again and again for sure!",5.0

21,"December 18, 2018","I had done my homework on line before I went car shopping so I made it easy for them! The sales rep had both cars brought to me. He answered all my questions competently. I decided which one I wanted and then we negotiated, just like that! I didn’t like the first interest offered, had a credit check run, and then was offered a much better deal! My son sat back in amazement (he had gone with me to help) at what was going on)! The rep helped get set with On Star and I was ready to go...I’m a happy customer! Note that before he passed away, my husband had purchased a truck from this dealership and had an equally positive experience. ",5.0

I'll be back!

39,"November 03, 2018","I wanted to buy local because you have a record of supporting the community. I wanted also a reliable place to have the car serviced both during and after warranty goes out. In every thing I do, especially buying a car, I want to be able to find someone  that I can know that I have expressed my needs will tell me forthright whether he and his company can fulfill those to the benefit of both. Dean tried to do that and I was impressed with his continuing efforts to do so. I know that I will never shop on a Saturday again because when it came to financing I will want to talk to my credit union because I don't always understand all the financial juggling  that goes on and I have built the kind of trust I spoke of with them for over 25 years. The deal would have closed early had I understood my particular procedure.",4.7

43,"October 24, 2018","Dennis  Hannemann knows the importance of attracting and keeping local business. Being a local native of Fredericksburg Like Mr. Hannemann, he really made the whole purchase experience a smooth one with no pressure to commit.  The whole deal just ""felt right"". Both Dennis and manager Lance Knopp worked with me on my trade-in and met my expectations. They both knew that I could have traveled elsewhere to find the best deal however they succeeded to keep my business  local.  By the way-this is not the first auto that I have purchased from Bob Price Chevrolet and also from Dennis.  In addition to this, I would also like to extend a huge ""THANK YOU"" to Brian Ferreira in the Service Dept. for ALWAYS taking care of my service repairs and maintenance on my vehicles.",5.0

47,"October 03, 2018","I had been car shopping for the last couple weeks in Houston ( where I currently live) with no luck and horrible customer service experiences. I was near the Fredericksburg area for a work conference and decided to check out the local car dealerships. BEST.DECISION. EVER! Dennis was so great!! He had excellent knowledge of the vehicle we were looking at, and was very easy to work with! He was very friendly, and not at all pushy with the sale like some sales men tend to be. Everyone we worked with at Bob Price was very friendly and made the car buying experience easy and stress free. I would highly recommend Dennis and the whole Bob Price Chevrolet team! They have a great selection of CPO vehicles, and I am completely in love with my 2017 GMC Terrain! The 4 hour drive from Houston was definitely worth it for me! I will be returning to Bob Price for my next car purchase! Thanks Dennis!!:)  ",5.0
48,"October 01, 2018","Friendly staff. Good communication. Worked on my behalf to make sure extended warranty outfit inspected and approved work that was obviously covered by the warranty. I should also mention that I bought this trade-in truck at Bob Price, but it wasn’t a GM vehicle. They told me when I bought it that they’d service it and they have. 🤠",5.0
