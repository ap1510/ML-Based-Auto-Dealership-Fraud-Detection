0,"February 26, 2020","My experience with this dealership has been exemplary!  Everything from the first meeting with our sales person, Cody, to getting the car through service for pickup.  We purchased the car within 24 hours of the car hitting the lot and it was over a holiday.  We agreed to the purchase prior to the car even making it to service to inspect the car.  They found a couple of items and corrected all of those issues.  Service had to order a part or two and I brought the car back a couple of weeks later and they repaired that item and also another item that was discovered with no hassle what so ever.  Brian was my service adviser and was amazing.  As I was heading out, one of the issues that was repaired triggered the warning light again.  He told me to schedule to bring it back in and they will get it taken care of.  I have not had the opportunity to do that as of yet, but hope to soon.  I have the car out of state and bringing it back is difficult to schedule.  They have bent over backwards to work with me.  It is for these reasons that I will return to Onion Creek VW.  I plan on upgrading in a couple of years and with this level of service, I will return to Austin to make the deal happen!!!  ",5.0
1,"November 07, 2019","I was devastated after I found out that my (newly bought) used car had $4K+ problems. An oil leak, water pump leak, torn bushing, alignment, the list goes on. Clearly the dealership I bought it from did nothing for it. Luckily, I bought an extended warranty for it and Felipe spent hours on the phone with them making claims and handling the inspector that the dealership sent. He helped me get EVERYTHING accounted for through the warranty I bought with the small exception of an oil change. Thank you for your excellent service!!!",5.0

His attention to our needs and our previous negative experience at another dealership made us feel understood. Ruben was patient and worked with us through our scenarios (purchasing vs. leasing) and gave us the space we needed to make our decision. Many thanks Ruben!!!,5.0
21,"August 03, 2017","DO NOT BUY A CAR FROM THIS DEALERSHIP.  Worst experience I have ever had with a car dealer or with Volkswagen in general.  Will not buy another certified pre owned VW and would not recommend this dealership to anyone.
I first came here to have an individual’s used car inspected as I was considering purchasing it.  That said this review is for the sales department up to the GM of this dealership as well as corporate Volkswagen.  Based on a poor inspection result of the car I was initially looking at I made my way to the car lot and found a certified pre-owned VW GTI.  Being as this was a CPO vehicle we did not perform a thorough inspection due to VW’s “thorough” 112 point inspection, which by the way is total BS and likely pencil whipped by this dealership.  Upon test drive we decided to go ahead and purchase the vehicle.  Once we finalized the paperwork (at which time I saw the CPO paperwork which detailed the car had no damage, was in working order, etc. etc.) and made our way out to the car we noticed dents on the roof of the car, dents on the hatch of the car, scratches on the hood, the front bumper, scratches on the hatch, all 4 wheels had large amounts of damage from driving against curbs, it was missing a floor mat, an interior vent control piece, missing 1 remote start key, the driver’s side interior molding near the seat belt was disconnected and falling off, and the bumper of the car has been driven over a curb and the lower plastic body panel was detached and falling off.  We brought all of these things to the salesmen’s attention and mentioned our CPO paperwork says that there is no damage on the car and each box is checked which he refused to fix other than some of the scratches on the trunk, which they did a terrible job of repairing and was not to satisfaction, basically just paint marker.  This doesn’t even include the fact that we left the dealership with a tire sensor light on and potentially a low tire which they also refused to check because the shop was closed!  By this time it was 10 minutes from dealership close so we had to leave the dealership.
We had made numerous attempts to contact the sales manager regarding these issues, being as our CPO sheet indicated that all of these things were with the car and that all of these parts had no damage.  He never returned our calls.  Thus, corporate VW was called and then was involved.  If you have any issues with this place, CALL CORPORATE!
Corporate was able to get all of these things fixed by the dealership, but they forced us to drive 6 hours round trip to the dealership and back and leave the car.  Upon return of the car we thought all would be repaired, WRONG.  They completely ignored all of the hatch damage, claiming they did not have to repair the damage as the scratches were under 1” in length and the dent wasn’t considered damage.  So I guess corporate VW considers the CPO inspection sheet indicating “No Damage” a bunch of BS as they did not force the dealership to repair this.  Along with this I called 5 other VW dealerships and even took my car into 1 for inspection, all of them said that the damage to the hatch should have been repaired as they would have never sold a CPO with that kind of damage.  Not to mention I asked corporate VW if they are alright with a dealership selling a quote “showroom ready car” or a “112 point inspection verified” vehicle that contains dents and scratches when the sheet clearly states no damage and is signed by the dealership.  They would not comment.  I asked if it is alright to sell a new car with this type of damage, once again no comment.
I will quote the VW website “Every certified pre-owned VW is subject to a 112-point dealer inspection, and no, one of those steps isn't just kicking the tires. A certified Volkswagen technician goes through each car with a fine-tooth comb. And if they find anything wrong, they'll repair or replace it.”  HA!  What a joke.  Don’t rely on VW to save you, nor the dealership, just another joke of a CPO program selling messed up trade ins with no quality control.
After 4-5 weeks of dealing with numerous issues, we are now planning on contacting a consumer protection attorney.  Would NOT recommend this experience to ANYONE!",1.0
22,"July 15, 2017","I don't normally leave reviews unless the experience was memorable. Unfortunately, this was an extraordinarily negative experience with this dealership. I recently purchased a 2017 Passat V6 in Dallas. I have had the vehicle for 3 weeks and received a notification of a serious issue with the brakes from the Car-Net app. I checked the dashboard of the vehicle, no warning lights and it seemed to drive as normal. I call VW roadside and they insist I take it to the dealer for diagnosis and send a tow for me. I call two local VW dealers and they tell me they can't get to it for two days. Ok, I get it, it's busy on a Saturday. I call ONION CREEK VOLKSWAGEN and I am told by Trina that they can get to it and to bring it in. So the tow truck and I head to Onion Creek Volkswagen. I get a call from Robert the service advisor and he asks what's going on, so I explain and he tells me to come on in and he'll take care me. Great! That's what I needed. I receive a call several minutes later and Robert tells me that the techs cannot even loom at my car for two days. Add insult to injury, they cannot provide a loaner nor a shuttle home!

I arrive at ONION CREEK VOLKSWAGEN and walk into the Service center and Robert was sitting at a desk and the Manager Larry Sowards was standing there as well. I introduce myself and Larry Sowards asked me what the problem was. After my explanation of the brake issue, he reiterates they cannot look at my car for two days. I ask for a loaner vehicle again and I am told that they have loaners, but not authorized to sign them out without a diagnostic first. I then asked for a ride back to my house at the very least and I'm told that it is outside of their ""area"". Larry Sowards proceeds to explain that each VW dealer is independent and basically can do what they want. After arguing with Larry Sowards for a few minutes, he agreed to give me a shuttle ride home and acted as if it was a hype inconvenience to him. I explained I still needed transport to and from work for the two days and he had no solution for me and suggested I make an appointment. I told him I would have to drive my car until they can get to it and he told me to have a nice day basically dismissing me. Not only did ONION CREEK VOLKSWAGEN provide the ABSOLUTELY WORSE customer service experience I've had in a long time, but allowed me to drive away with a vehicle with a potential brake issue putting myself and others in danger!

The moral of the story is ONION CREEK VOLKSWAGEN misleads its potential customers and refuses to service vehicles they did not sell. I strongly suggest you visit Charles Maund or Hewlett VW for your service needs. It would take an act of congress to get me to visit ONION CREEK VOLKSWAGEN again. Please heed my warning, you'll be thankful!",1.0
23,"June 08, 2017","I rarely submit reviews but still cannot get over the amazing experience I had when purchasing my Passat R-line. 

The major differentiator came from the sales associate surprisingly. He never tried to force anything upon me or sway any decisions in his favor nor did he ever harass me with calls after. In fact, he even persuaded me to take an extra day before making a hasty decision that I might later regret. 

I can honestly say that I have never experienced anything like that from a sales associate in the auto industry. Ask for JEFF ELLIS if you want to actually enjoy the experience.

In reference to Onion Creek Volkswagen itself, I love the dealer perk where I can bring my car in anytime to have it detailed at no cost. Keep it up guys!",5.0
24,"March 14, 2017","Being 63 and a former car salesman in Austin for over 8 years I can tell you this was the worst place I have ever dealt with. I should have left after the manager lied to us and told us there wasn't any jabanero orange beatle convertibles.available while my wife was looking at one in San Antonio.  or after 9 hours there I wouldn't ever take the care there for service. Never Again.

25,"February 09, 2017","I vowed to NEVER have my car serviced here again! The first time was horrible for mutiple reasons. My boyfriend actually initiated this reunion before I could tell him any different. But Stephen was great! 5 stars for him and his customer service!! I recieved a video text from one of the techs which was awsome.  He explained all that I needed done, as well as an email with the prices. The difference being the way it was presented....with sincerity, understanding, and kindness.
 Fabulous experience!",5.0
26,"January 27, 2017","Let me start off with stating that if I could give negative stars, I absolutely would. Today my wife and I went to this dealership looking at new vehicles. We had been looking for something with a manual transmission. Our first contact with the salesman included him approaching us and talking on his cell phone. To me, that starts the interaction with ""I've got more important people to deal with than you."" As the salesman inquired as to what we were looking for, we informed him that I was looking for something with a manual transmission, but I was not sure what models I would like. He then pointed us towards the Jetta, which is a very nice looking sedan. He then went from car to car looking inside of each to see which were manuals and which were automatics. At this point the better option would have been to check inventory on their computers to see which cars where manuals, but we finally found one on the back row of the lot. When we found it, he took the stock number and ""went to go grab keys"". After about 10 minutes, my wife and I began making our way back towards the front of the lot. He then explained to us that the service department had the keys due to the vehicle being delivered recently. We then went back to the car. When we got back to the car, he unlocked it and asked if we wanted to go on a test drive. We agreed that we would like to drive it. He then told us to drive to the side of the building and he would make copies of my information. After arriving, he spoke with another customer for about 5 minutes while I was waiting for my driver's license and insurance to be returned to me. He was standing right in front of us. He then suggested a route for us to test drive the vehicle on and told us he would see us when we got back. He told us that when we got back, he would be waiting inside for us to pull up. This made me uncomfortable for several reasons. One, I was driving a vehicle I was not familiar with, without someone that knew anything about it or that could explain the features to me. Two, I was not from the area. Three, it made us feel like us buying a vehicle was unimportant to him. Anyways, we did our test drive, returned, and guess where the salesman was? Nowhere to be found. The receptionist paged him 3 times. He only returned when we handed the keys to the new car sales manager and we were walking to the door. He then approached us and we decided to ask about the cost of the car. After discussing the price, we asked for a moment to speak to each other. He then told us that he was going to go next door to the used car sales office. At this time we chose to leave. This salesman appeared to be more interested in selling cars to other people. There were several other car salesman standing around waiting for customers, so I feel there was no need for him to have been rushing all over the place, he could have easily let one of the other salesman deal with the other customers. I did not feel like this dealership cared about the service or the experience, only about selling the vehicle. The salesman's name was ""Soulman""",1.0
27,"December 03, 2016","I give Volkswagen Onion Creek a 5 Star rating, because they were very professional and provided me with the best customer service during my stressful situation with my new vehicle that I purchased at Nissan of San Marcos...don't ever go there! VW Onion Creek even provided me with a loaner until I was able to figure out my transportation situation. Thank you to all the staff and especially Robert Rodriguez for all his hard work!",5.0
28,"December 03, 2016","The initial purpose of my visit was to initiate the buyback process for my 2012 Jetta TDI. The team at Onion Creek were helpful and offered an additional good will incentive over what VW Corporate provided. During this period, I also had service performed on my TDI which was performed to the cost estimate provided and the work met my expectations for completion and scope. Just recently, I decided to proceed with a replacement of my TDI with another VW. I have been quite satisfied with the Passat and Jetta I have owned. I was able to get a good deal on a 2016 1.4T Jetta S/with Technology. To date I have been happy with my choice. Still waiting for the buyback date to be scheduled, but this is not a dealership issue.",4.0

30,"November 30, 2016",Bought my new Passat here last week.  Priced all dealers from San Antonio and Austin.  They were over $400 less than any other dealer.  Certainly worth the 40 mile drive.  Would highly recommend checkig them out if you are looking for a new VW.,5.0
31,"November 28, 2016","I would recommend without hesitation purchasing a vehicle from this dealership.  The individuals who work here are not your typical ""car salesmen"" - they give you space and answer any questions you have without overwhelming you.  I also felt as though the dealership was EXTREMELY fair with me when it came to my vehicle trade in.  

My salesman was Keston Makil who did a great job by helping me, giving me space, was very knowledgable with all the answers he provided, and genuinely appearedas though he wanted my experience to be a great one.  After purchasing my vehicle, Keston even took the time to go out to my car and help me set up the bluetooth on my cell phone to the car.  Keston also took the time to go over several other working details about my car like cruise control.  It is little details like this that made my experience such a great one.

Final detail is that the owner of the dealership took time out of his day to thank me for the purchase and ensured my experience was a great one.  I would without hesitation recommend this dealership.

34,"October 17, 2015","I have always been a VW fan, but after buying my preowned 2013 Jetta from Onion Creek VW, I am a huge fan of this dealership, also.  My salesman, Soul, asked what features I wanted in a vehicle and showed me a variety of cars that fit my needs. There was no pressure to buy a car, unlike dealerships I've purchased from in the past. They worked with me to negotiate the best price, and I left feeling extremely satisfied. I highly recommend Onion Creek VW!",5.0
35,"September 15, 2015","Do not go to this dealership,  they pull the whole bait and switch! !!  Drove today all the way from San Antonio to test drive one of their cars. They've been knowing that my daughter was interested in this car. Even asked her questions the night before.  That should of been a give away.    After waiting for a while for JACOB, he comes to us with "" the car was sold last night but we have other cars here.""  Seriously,  you just told us it was being cleaned.  Onion Creek VW lost a sale for holding out to whatever else they had.  Horrible customer service. Not about the customers needs or wants.

36,"July 18, 2015","These people are crooks. They ruined my car. Read all the reviews on the internet and do not become a victim of these people.  We can not let them continue to do business this way and take advantage of people.  The charged me $1300, still did not fix the problem, then wanted more money and when I said no, they had to push my car out because it no-longer would start yet I drove it in to them. They used a bad part from a blown engine to test my vehicle then tried to deny it. I have their conversations recorded. Their mechanic took my daughter for a test drive them attempted to flirt with her. She felt so uncomfortable and afraid of him. They told us it was ok to drive the car because they had to order a part. We brought it back to have the new part installed and then calked me back afterwards to tell me now the car won't start and I needed to pay for more hours so they could diagnose it further.  You trust that they know what they are doing and recommending, then they turn around and screw you over and try and milk you for more money. Join me and sending these pool a strong message that this type of business practices will not be tolerated.  If you have had similar incidents, please join the class action lawsuit and tell them justice will prevail.  Onion Creek VW in my opinion practices in bad faith and attempts to defraud the public.",1.0

The exact model I was looking for was not available in their inventory, but we got all of the paperwork signed and they sent me home in a loaner.  36 hours later, my car had arrived from another dealership, was prepped and ready to go.  The delivery process was fun and very thorough.  Joeleen made sure I knew exactly how everything in the car worked and even gave me a follow up call a week later to make sure everything was going great with the car.

Shawn picked up that I did my research and was set on what I was looking for however did offer some advice. You could see he was trying to find a car that would meet my needs, proud to drive it, and fit in my budget. 

After looking at the specs of each car, Shawn picked out two vehicles to test drive. Before each test drive, Shawn showed me the features and options each car came with, even tips and tricks on each car. Who knew the fuel cap door locks when lock the car? After the test drive, Shawn gave me quotes on both models. There was no pressure from him to finalize the deal, even though there were a good deal. ",4.8

Mr. Eiji definitely did an excellent job to make my move to Austin as easy as it could be.  We talked via Email and he helped me choose/reserve/ship the vehicle to the store. It was very kind of him picking me up from the airport and later showing all the new functions of the Tiguan while the finance team were doing all the paper work.

Caleb was very helpful as they serached for the right color and had our Tiguan brought in from another dealership to meet the specifications we wanted.

44,"January 05, 2014","Mr. Eiji Evans was incredible!  He definitely takes the anxiety out of having to deal with that stereo type car salesman that we're so used to!  I had researched the auto that I wanted & went up north to the other vw dealership. I loved the car & knew I'd be buying it but just wanted the best possible deal without all of the volleying back & forth. I'd spoken to two other salesman at other dealers prior to Mr. Evans & told him, ""look, I know what I want & I know what a good deal is & what I expect & don't want to haggle. I just want THE BEST DEAL & I will buy it if you give it to me, I want your best possible deal period. Figure it out & get back to me, if it's a good deal I'll get it, if it's not the best deal, I'll go elsewhere."" We'll let me just tell you, HE GAVE ME AN AMAZING DEAL on the first shot!  A deal that I couldn't refuse & then some.  VW really should have other employees shadow Mr. Evans on what to do & how to deliver a great customer service experience.  He deserves dealer of the year award - he really has a gift in dealing with customers. He's fair & honest.  Sounds simple but is really hard to come by these days - what a gem!  I will continue to purchase VW's from Mr. Evans wherever he goes. The other guys at the other dealer? Way off! When I told them why I didn't go with them & the deal that Mr. Evans gave me on my 2024 car, they couldn't believe it & then had the nerve to say be careful & double check to make sure it's not a 2013.  I checked, it's not! I got what I paid for - a fair deal, honesty, great customer service, a great experience & a shiny new car! Thank you Onion Creek VW & Mr. Evans for making it so easy!",5.0
