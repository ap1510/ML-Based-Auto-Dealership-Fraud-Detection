1,"June 09, 2020","They performed a recall incorrectly on my Fusion, but I didn't notice it till after two years later.  Now they won't do anything to fix it and Ford won't do anything either.  So if you have work done here I highly recommend taking it to an actual mechanic to verify that they did the work correctly. Otherwise they'll literally tell you, ""you're xxxx out of luck.""  Cause that's what they actually told me.",1.0

4,"May 29, 2020","STAY AWAY! CUSTOMER BEWARE!!! If you need your vehicle repaired do not go to Big Star Ford. Long story short, my ac went out and I brought it to Big Star Ford for a diagnostic, because the Vehicle Repair Service Center was not far from my home. After getting back a quote of approximately $2,200, I decided to pay the approximate $143 diagnostic fee and take my vehicle to Christian Brothers for the repair. Christian Brothers charged me approximately $1,400 to do the same AC job on my King Ranch Ford F-150. Here is where things get dicey. As Christian Brother was evaluating my truck, they discovered that my carpet had been cut, wires were left unhooked in my engine, bolts were missing from my center console, and an actuator was missing.

I informed Big Star Ford regarding what Christian Brothers reported to me and from the onset they denied everything. The service manager did not get back with me within the timeframe that he said he would. The service manager went as far as to say that nothing was pulled from my truck to confirm that I needed a new evaporator core. I could give many more details, but I will stop right there (because I am not a certified mechanic). I did however get the opinion of two qualified professionals who work in the industry and who explained the process that happens to check if an evaporator core is properly functioning. The feedback from those two qualified professionals who work in the industry does not match what I was told by the Big Star Ford Service Center Manager. From the feedback I received from those qualified professionals that work in the industry and through my own research; what I now understand is that the Big Star Ford Vehicle Service Center failed to do their due diligence when it comes to giving the customer a multi-point inspection. 

My last two points of concern, the vehicle service center manager admitted that one of his employees took a horn out of a vehicle and did not put it back in. At that moment, his admittance of this did not make me feel any more comfortable about the issues I reported as a result of another company accessing my vehicle after it left the hands of Big Star Ford Vehicle Service Center. Last, of my two final concerns, I had a conversation and was showing an employee the pictures of wires that were left unhooked and their exact words to me were, 'We get a lot of complaints about that department all the time and I would never personally allow them to work on my vehicle. I’m not surprised that you had an issue.” So, what am I asking for at this point from the Big Star Ford Vehicle Service Center, absolutely nothing? After speaking to my wife about the whole ordeal we both believed the best thing to do is to inform other consumers. And yes, I was the guy that gave Big Start Ford Vehicle Service Center a 5 Star rating as I paid for my diagnostic, but little did I know what was about to be discovered. Customers, please do your research before using Big Star Ford Vehicle Service Center. God bless you, Donald R. Brown, Jr. Ph.D.   ",1.2

7,"April 26, 2020","Richard Chapple is an awesome salesman, he went out of his way to make sure I left with my new truck! 
Raymond Bruner is also very kind and professional making sure customer satisfaction is met! 
I do not have perfect credit but I did have a large down payment, I went to several other Ford dealers and they just said NO! They did not even ask if we could work together on it but Richard did and I got my truck and Raymond made sure all the numbers were in my comfort zone, as a nurse we don't always have perfect credit not because of money we are just to tired from crazy shifts to do the little things.
I must say the get ready department is not on board, my truck was not clean inside :( 

Thank you Big Star Ford from one very satisfied customer,

21,"November 02, 2019","I had been looking for a 2019 XL 150 for months and had been watching one on Big Stars website. Over the months I had been shopping I tried setting up a deal online several times and received estimates with my trade in. I finally “locked in” an acceptable deal with Big Star and printed it out along with three other offers that matched the price. (I had actually run the deal through 4 times in the previous months with Big Star and each time got the same quote.) 

So, I called the salesman and told him I was going to my credit union to get financing for the deal I had “locked in” . He said “Great, I will have it ready for you.” 

When I got there we started talking and they wanted 5000 dollars more than the agreed upon price. They kept telling me about all the extras on the truck and I kept telling them all those extras were included on the online deal and there were no “extra” extras that they kept talking about. So we went back and forth for three hours. All during which we had to listen to our salesman talking about his upcoming birthday party at the casino in Louisiana. I finally got them down to within 1500 dollars of my target and just gave in. I was worn out from the deal and I just needed the truck at that point. 

Later I filled out a survey in which I wasn’t very nice to Big Star and I got a call from Tim J. He said he was the manager and wanted to know if there was anything they could do to make things better. I of course asked for the 1500 but that wasn’t an option. Instead I asked for a brush guard and he agreed. He said he would order it and they would call me in a week. 

I waited and nobody called. I was moving and very busy so I gave them another week, still no call. So I called them and I was told it was never ordered so we went through all the “wait another week” stuff. Still no call. I had moved at this point and I had a new job so this was becoming a real issue. Finally, after nearly a month I get my brush guard. Nice, but we are not done with B.S. They sent me someone else’s license plates!  I cannot imagine how bad that might have been if I hadn’t noticed and put them on the truck. To make things worse they asked me to bring the plates to them. I live 160 miles away! I had to pay 10 dollars to ship them back.

I now get 4 to 5 calls a week to sell me a new car. All from Big Star. I tell them the same thing every time. “I just bought a truck and am not looking any longer. Please stop calling.” Well they don’t stop. I texted the guy who got me the brush guard and told him. He said he would take care of it and 10 minutes later I got another call at work...I am teacher. Calls at work are supposed to be “Emergency Only”. Bad experience doesn’t begin to describe this one.

In short: 
    Big Star does not honor their online deals.
    They are very bad at communicating between departments 
    They will tell you anything to make you go away
    They do not return calls in the service department and they don’t follow through on problems 
    They could care less about your circumstances or your time

Have your ducks in a row if you intend to do business with Big Star. I have a feeling my deal would have headed south in a big hurry if I had not taken the time to prepare for it.",1.6

24,"October 01, 2019","My in-laws have been waiting for the last day of the month to get a truck note they can afford. I called all around Houston between work, and while driving as the day was running out, to try to help them handle it. I had one lined up at Baytown, but Derek assured me he was the manager at Big Star and could give me the bottom-line price of what’s on the lot. His lying truly caused us to miss the truck for cheaper at Baytown Ford from a guy that said Derek would do what he did. Sure enough, when my parents were just making it in time from driving all the way from Sugar Land, Derek raised the price to 1900 from what we had agreed on... Knowing I wasn't about to buy some story at that point, he still tried saying that he was selling us the car for the agreed price, but there were some extras on the car worth 2990 that were a deal for 1900.... I had already covered this situation with him earlier in the day, and talked about our situation of trying to get to our price before tt&l, and 1) he assured me, 2)  knowingly lied, and 3) caused us to miss a good deal on the same 19 that may not even be around next month.... xxxx of xxxx, I hope he sees this. They were depending on me, and I relied on his lies... I stand by this review 100% -he knew what he was doing ---I was VERY CLEAR on what I had been through and the bottom price we could pay... I can’t believe anyone would let this person by their face.. truly living up to the acronym B.S. Ford…",1.0

29,"July 06, 2019","I found a truck on the True Car website and inquired about it. When I arrived at Big Star Ford, they evaluated my trade-in and suddenly the price of the truck increased by $3,000. When I asked why, I was told that the ""true price"" shown on the site is not actually the true price--the dealer had added tires and rims but not adjusted the price to reflect their investment. In other words, it was the old bait and switch. I foolishly purchased the truck from them anyway as it was the only one in my area that fit my needs at the time. During the purchase, I was told the dealer had two sets of keys for the truck. However, after signing all the paperwork, low and behold, they were only able to locate a single key. I was then told that I could have a second key made at my local dealer and email the receipt for reimbursement. I am still waiting for that illusive ""check in the mail."" Of course all of their voicemail boxes are full and I cannot get a single response to email. I am currently waiting to hear the outcome of my claim with the BBB. My advice--avoid this dealership at all costs. You are better off taking the bus!",1.2

41,"April 14, 2019","Let’s start at the beginning. Second week of October I bought a truck from Big Star. When I went in I told them I wanted a XL F150. Instead they start bring out platinum and king ranch trucks. I keep saying I want a XL F150. So they bring out this loaded XLT and its nothing what I’m looking for. They tell me this is the only truck that they can approve. Half way filling out the contract I change my mind and want to wait. They tell me they are the only dealership that can get me a truck and if I try somewhere else, my credit will drop and I can’t get a truck anywhere. So I get it. Then while I getting it I ordered mirror for the truck. Tell me it’s going to be a week or 2 to get them. So after 2 weeks I start to call to find out what’s going on. 2 days before thanksgiving I drive over after calling 18 times and never getting a call back. “They just came in” I was told. Then find out they sold them 3 weeks before. A week later they come in. While it’s in the shop I tell them about a few other problems. Get the truck back and instantly I find out none of the problems have been fixed. So they run the truck back and plug it up and tell me it’s a glich in the computer but it’s fixed.  

At this point I’ve contacted the sales person who sold me the truck and actually quit 2 days after I get the truck because I’m there words “ all they do is screw people. They told me to sell you that truck and wouldn’t look for any other truck. They force people in to trucks they need to get rid of.” 

So in February I decided to go in again to see if I can get everything fixed. And after 6 weeks of sitting there, it’s in worse condition then when I dropped it off. Key pad quit, screen keeps going out, accelerator doesn’t always work, still smokes when you start it, still has the ticking noise. It’s truly amazing that a dealership would treat a customer like that. 

I will not be taking this down. I will be sharing it everywhere I see them advertising. It’s unamerican how they treat people. There is honestly a lot more I can say. I’ve talked to 3 X employees and they all say the same about them. They just want your money and for you to go away. ",1.0

43,"April 07, 2019","Absolutely TERRIBLE service department and a collision center!!  Worst experience EVER WITH ANY TYPE OF BUSINESS, PERIOD! Following a wreck they had our vehicle for ALMOST 4 MONTHS!!  TOOK it home again today after bringing it back once already for missed repairs and screw ups, to discover thst they basically had it for 5 weeks and did nothing at all.  They did further damage while ""fixing"" it, to the interior plastic, ruined the fabric on the ceiling with greasy, dirty hands I assume, and incorrectly install a new steering wheel.   They also gave it back both times with ZERO GAS AND ABSOLUTELY FILTHY inside and out. That's not all the issues either but this already cost me enough time.    Bottom line if you want actual ""service"" and your WANT YOUR car to be worked on by mechanics that don't need to print out instructions for installing a steering wheel, AND STILL DON'T GET IT WRONG, then DON'T TAKE YOUR CAR HERE !!!!!!",1.2

45,"March 29, 2019","I turned in my 2018 Mustang 10 days ago because the rear end is making a strange noise.  2 days later they said they had found out what causing the noise and just had to figure out the fix. They told my daughter 3 days later they found out what was wrong and they were either going to repair the rear in or  replace.  Well when I called today to check on it they said they were still looking for the cause.  I'm pretty sure they haven't look at it.  THIS IS THE LAST TIME I WILL BE GOING TO BIGSTAR  FORD IN MANVEL.   As a Ford dealer you would think they would know how to repair their own products.

60,"October 01, 2018","My salesman was great when I purchased my wife’s Expedition. I believe his name was Nick, it started about a month after my purchase. We have the 3.5 Ecoboost, it started making a chirping sound on the passenger side. I live in Lake Jackson so I took it Gulf Coast Ford. It turns out to be the exhaust manifold gasket. They had our vehicle in and out with in 3 days. A month later the driver side started making the same noise. Gulf coast didn’t have any loaners cars so I figured I’d give Big Star a chance since that is where I purchased the vehicle. What took Gulf Coast 3 days to fix took Big Star Ford almost 3 weeks. I had to delay our family vacation a few days because of how long they had our vehicle. We had a planned to Drive to California. When I called upset they offered to comp me a free oil change. I agreed and they apologized, we took the Expedition the next day to California. It wasn’t till the past week when I knew something was wrong. I went to change the oil and only 2.5 qts came out. I opened the hood and there was oil all over the inside of the hood. We drove all the way to California and back with no oil cap. Not only did they take 5 times longer to fix our car than Gulf Coast Ford. But they offered to give us a free oil change and can’t even put back the xxxx oil cap. I called today asking if they could pay for the replacement cap that I had ordered. They agreed to pay and give me a call. I had ordered the part from Yaklin Ford since it was in my area. I went to pick up the part and it was never paid for. Tried calling and could not get an answer. I will never take my vehicle there to service again. It was a complete nightmare. The sales team is very friendly but they have to do something about service, it’s ridiculous. ",1.4

Was told this is a normal charge of over 2 grand and it just gets added to the final price...I guess they think not many will just walk away at this point and I assume this is why they want you to sign all the other documents first.

62,"May 16, 2018","My experience with this dealership was the worst to date! After registering on the web, I had a call from a sales person that night before. All good and positive vibes, The next day I showed up to the used car dealer ship of Big Star Ford. Now to be fair (yet they were NOT) my credit profile and life situation has changed in the last year due to a divorce and a personal illness. I made the sale person COMPLETELY AWARE of my situation before I showed up that morning. Well once I was there, they got my basic credit info and ran a credit report. To my surprise the sales rep said I had four repossessions on my account. I told them I NEVER HAD A REPO. I reminded them I my last vehicle, a $ 60,000.00 truck was purchased there. At that point I was treated like ROAD KILL WITH A STINK. No one would even look at me, any questions I asked were replied with I don't know.
Before I left I check my credit report on line  and it showed no repos. I called Experian and told them of the situation. I named a few of the lenders which claimed I had a repo. Only one was on my credit report and it showed current and paid in full. Man I was beyond angry. I write a email to Big Star and some dumb xxx manager name Robert called me back. He had an attitude right of the bat. I was quick to put him in his place and inform him that I was at another dealership and there wasn't an issue with me credit report. I told this idiot that they made a mistake and did not submit two years of my residence and that effected the results. The jerk had the never to ask me if I had bought a car. I said no. With out skipping a beat this jerk, said, well come back and let us sell you a car and make it up. I submitted a second letter asking for a manager who cares about CUSTOMER SERVICE TO CONTACT ME, but not such luck. Today I received a letter from BIG STAR FORD indicating mt score which was exactly what I told them it was. No apologizes for there unprofessional behavior after the mistake and no mention of my two mails I sent in asking a someone who cared for a loyal customer. To make things worst, I had been paying them $104.00 a month since I bought my truck in 2014 for oil changes. 
Look, I my self have been in customer service management for near 20 years. Mistakes are made. How you recover tells what kind of character and value for customer service you. THIS BIG STAR FORD IS A JOKE AND DON'T GIVE A xxxx ABOUT YOU AS A CUSTOMER. THIS IS JUST THE FIRST OF MANY REVIEW I WILL BE SUBMITTING. I HAVE NEVER BEEN TREATED SO BADLY ESPECIALY AFTER GIVING THEM MY BUSINESS SINCE 2014. Totally unprofessional and unworthy of CUSTOMERS HARD EARNED MANY. COWARDS.",1.0
63,"May 15, 2018","I am person who is using Toyota and Honda for long time. For the first time I thought of buying a ford SUV for my small family. I started talking with different dealerships and 4 dealerships came with some great deals. So, I was more than happy with the decision I took to buy ford. Since I ended up with same deals from four different dealership I choose Big Star Ford located in Manvel because they were the first one who came up with the deal. I talked with one of the associate and came in to deal about the car and the drive out price of the vehicle. Yesterday (May 15, 2018) after 7.30pm I called Jacques Davidson(Jack) who I was talking with and told him that I will be coming to the dealership to sign the contract. He told that he is logging out and he has passed everything to another associate. I went there with couple of my friends and when I checked the vehicle there was already 450 miles on that. I asked the associate about that and he told me, that was the car he was telling, and I enquired whether they have different one in same model. It was surprising to me that they told that they don’t have any base model in the showroom. Such a big showroom and doesn’t have another car that too a base model. 
I told the associate that I need to talk to the manager and I believed that managers are the one who good to deal with the customers. We went to his desk and was standing there, and he didn’t offer as a seat to sit and talk. We were standing there and told him that we were having a deal with associate for 2018 ford Explorer for 29000 Drive out and I showed him the proof of mail (I have attached along with this and I have the whole conversation in the email). He checked something and told me that they can’t do that for that price. We asked him that it is his employee who send the mail. He was acting crazy, rude, Sarcastic and told me that he doesn’t know about that and asked to check with the associate who provided that. I am hearing that for the first time a manager telling that he doesn’t have any responsibility for what his employee did.  Here comes the worst part. We were totally disappointed and told them that we were having same deals in Russel and Smith and Joe Myers and we wasted our time and travelled all the way with the deal which his associate gave us. He insulted us saying that “it’s only 8.45pm now, still got 15 minutes left to reach different dealership and Russel and Smith is nearby and can go and talk with them”. How can a manger can be impolite to a customer? I am surprised seeing all these 4 stars for this dealership. If the manager is acting like this how will be the associate.  I am seriously rethinking about taking Ford only because of the bitter experience I got from this dealership. 


There is no option to give 0 star otherwise definitely would give that.

65,"May 11, 2018","My initial rating when I bought two vehicles from Alfred at Big Star was great, 5 stars!  I also bought the Advantage Care for both of my vehicles.  Once I started using the Advantage Care System with their Service Department is where things went down hill.  They promised my vehicles would take 1 1/2 hours to do the oil change.  They took over 2+.  I completed several surveys they requested explaining this situation.  They promised they were fixing their Service Department, but yet again it didn't get taken care of.  I went in for a final oil change on my advantage care, only to be told by a very rude Service Manager that they could no longer do business with me because of my bad experiences.  I have never heard of such and ended up meeting with the GSM who only handed me a check to have my oil changed somewhere else and that they would no longer do business with me.  I have been around the car business along time and never have I been treated so poorly!! My advise to you would be to STAY AWAY COMPLETELY FROM THIS DEALERSHIP!! Be aware!!",1.4

I have been bringing my two Fords for service for about 5 years.  The staff turn over is unbelievable as soon as you get to know someone and they get to know you they are gone.  I had tried to purchase a new car and visited the showroom on numerous occasions.  The sales support was worse than the service department.  The salesmen did not know anything about the Fords he was trying to sell and when we found someone that knew a little bit about the cars there was no follow up to meet the vehicle needs we wanted, so be bought our new car at another dealership.  Recently tried to make a service appointment for a vehicle inspection but the on line reservation system was not working.  Called and made a appointment on the telephone waiting on hold forever and when I arrived 20 minutes later per the appointment I was told they could not honor the appointment that was confirmed 20 minutes earlier because their system was down.  Why did they make the appointment if the system was down? This Ford Dealership has been going down hill over the last five years and it still continues to be just plain terrible in all aspects of customer support and desire for repeat business.    There are a lot other Ford Dealerships in the Houston area and would recommend not going to Big Star Ford for any of Ford related new car and Truck Sales and servicing.",2.4

He then directed me to a employee named Gregory.  This individual made feel as though I was interrupting him.  He was not professional and he did not answer any of my questions.  I asked to speak to a manager; he responded by saying I don't know where he is.  I than asked to speak to the  General Manager, he responded shortly, he went to lunch.  He told me that I had to leave my vehicle for 24 hours, I asked him if he had a courtesy vehicle, he said he did.  He asked me where I lived I told him Webster.

81,"July 21, 2017","I’m highly disappointed with the integrity of this dealership. For my own credibility, (because I have little respect for enraged reviews without sufficient reason) I have personally purchased the following vehicles at the dealerships listed. I’m more than happy to discuss my experiences at any of these dealerships as I may have purchased more vehicles than tennis shoes in the past few years. 
2004 Nissan Titan SE (Pre-owned – Allen Samuels Dodge in Katy)
2013 Ford Fusion Titanium (New – Helfman Ford in Stafford)
2014 Dodge Challenger R/T (New – Allen Samuels Dodge in Katy)
2014 Nissan Titan Pro-4x (New – Douglass Nissan in College Station)

2015 Dodge Challenger R/T Scat Pack (New – Ryan Dodge in Sealy)
	I was very excited to look at a particular pre-owned car on the lot today and worked with Kevin Butcher. We went on two test drives, he gave me space to look over the car myself, then we returned to his desk to negotiate a sales price. There were several back and forth trips to the manager’s office, but ultimately, after I started to leave the dealership, I received a call from Kevin stating that his managers agreed to the said price, IF I return to purchase the car right now. Since this was the price I wanted and Kevin had the managers’ approval, I returned to the office to begin signing paperwork. I was fully committed to purchasing the car. They asked me to return to Kevin’s desk and had me wait for 10-15 minutes. I grabbed the keys and stepped outside to look over the car once again. Much to my surprise, Kevin met me at the door outside and told me, (Get this!) they couldn’t do the deal they just agreed to. After taking off work and spending four hours of my afternoon there, I can’t say much more than I am highly disappointed with the level of service, Big Star Ford has provided. I am personally in Sales and know that once you have agreed to a deal, it’s not right to go back on your handshake. 
I hope this helps anyone with intentions to purchase a vehicle here. I called and promised that I would write a review of my experience here, and this is me staying true to my word. Unlike the sales team at Big Star Ford in Manvel.

88,"March 31, 2017","Big Star Ford - Manvel Texas. Experience started off OK but as with all previous dealerships I have purchased cars from the sales people love to play on your emotions, leave you waiting forever and generally tell you a bunch of nonsense. This was no different. Anyway having agreed my trade in and a cash payment for the remainder I was ready to write a check. The dealership had all the necessary personal information etc. Then came what I can only class as a scam?  Please complete this credit reference for your Title documentation. What rubbish. When I refused the salesperson showed his anger. So finally I did drive away with the car following 3 hours of absolute time wasting that I am sure they just did for the sake of it. Even the finance guy didn't try to sell me an extended warranty! All done I drove home only to realize my mistake of not having checked if the owners manual was in the glove box. Having spoken to two people on the phone and being promised a call back by the sales person I have yet to hear from them. Terrible. AVOID THIS PLACE is my advice. They are plenty of other garages where you will be treated better and they’d be happy for your business. Their thank you letter that arrived today stated I had chosen them as my local dealer! That is taking liberty and far from the truth.
Footnote: tabled a note on BBB which got their attention immediately. So lets give credit where its due, some redemption is they answered that query admirably with regards paying for an owners manual which I appreciated. 9 days later  the sales chap called and said one would be in the post with the missing battery tool.

132,"September 11, 2016","Absolutely awful. I visited 3 times in one day trying to make a deal to get my wife the car she's always wanted. Took my wife and 3 year old on the second visit. Spent an hour and did the usual back and forth. After we couldn't come to terms, I decided to leave. Then it got bad. 

15 minutes after leaving our salesman (Clay) called and had talked to his manager and got the numbers where I was comfortable. Actually it wasn't right were I wanted. About $600 off but I figured I was happy, she'd be happy. We all win. Dropped my wife and kid off at the house and headed back to the dealership at 9:45 to finish the paperwork and get back home in a new suv. 

Sat down with the finance dept and all the sudden the price jumped $1900 dollars because of the window tint they say (fees it was labeled)

Now we are back up a few grand for a $75 two window tint job and what they claim is an alarm they added (I'm pretty confident its factory from ford, there was no aftermarket fob or anything but I could be wrong on that part)

What's the worse? I have a voicemail from my salesman that says the specific price for the vehicle and what they'd pay on my trade. Looks like they won't be honoring what I was told, and drove half way across Houston 3 times for.

My service rep was a man named Scott.  Great guy.  Answered my questions and was quick to respond to any problems I saw.  I plan to work with him on any future repair needs I have. 

The mechanical work is always good.  I’ve had truck serviced there 3 times and have never had to go back.  Not being a mechanic the only way I can tell if something’s fixed is if it doesn’t cause any more problems. 

One word of caution is that you should always question the bill before they ever start work.  When I say question the bill I mean both the cost and need.  With every repair shop I’ve ever worked with there has been patterns to they’re charges and Big Star is no exception.  They are, after all, in business to make money.  

That said, I plan to keep using them.

What service I asked?  Well not sure but I can get that info for you. Decided to go see the them in person as the salesman never called me back concerning my offer. When I called him the next day, he said sales manager was supposed to call me back. He then told me I was more likely to make a deal in person. No problem. I'll drive 45 minutes out of my way to try to deal. Internet price was lowered by $306!  But what about those service charges?  Well apparently that's a different department. Anyways, asked for a deal. Same numbers as last night. Didn't even come down the $306.   I agreed to come up $1000.00 on my offer. They said they would not come down. But what about the $306.00 Internet price reduction?  "" I'm sorry but that's the bed we can do"".

I said NO Thank you…  And the tires would be ready Monday.  I turned the car in on a Saturday.  Please look at the transmission its skips.  I show up ON Tuesday thinking my car had new tires and was ready to go.  WRONG!!

When the dealership tried to add on an extra $1,600 to our purchase price at the end of the sales negotiation, he went to bat for us and they held to the listed price.  However, that was very shifty.  The sales manager said that the upcharge was for improvements and work that they had invested in the vehicle, but that is not a correct way to do business.  Then, when it came time to do the final paperwork for the car, there were 2 separate extended warranty policies that were added to the contract without us realizing that they were not part of the extended warranty package that was being purchased.  Luckily, you have 30 days to cancel such policies.  However, getting in touch with the right person to do this, and having them take proper action was very difficult.

I had a service done on June 8th 2015 and afterwards I noticed that fluids were not topped off and grease marks on inside panels of car. I then needed some more items fixed so I made an appointment for today June 19th at 8 am. I arrived at 7:45 dropped the keys off and asked how long it would be, the reply was a couple of hours so I told the service coordinator I would wait. At 9:50 I noticed my car was still parked and I inquired how much longer it would be. I was told the technician was working on it. I informed him no one is working on it because the car is still parked. The service coordinator went and asked the technician who came back and told me he was still waiting on some parts. Eleven days and they still did not have the parts for the job and they just left me sitting in the waiting area. I asked for my keys back and left. When I asked what is the purpose of having a 8am appointment I was told that was for the advisor not the service. I had the advice on June 8th. Absolute waste of customers' time. The Service Drive Manager asked how things were going when he walked by and when I told him he didn't even come back to me to give an update after he checked up on the problem. Another customer asked what happened and when I told him he mentioned he was having similar problems. I purchased both my vehicles at this dealership and have all services done there but over the past few years customer service and trustworthiness have declined significantly.

256,"June 13, 2015","I purchased a used Focus from Big Star in a conditional sale as the vehicle had a vibration.  At first the mechanic at Big Star said it was the motor mounts.  The motor mounts were replaced, the vehicle continued to have abnormal vibration.  We took the vehicle to a different service center for maintenance and were told the motor had significant motor movement and that the motor mounts likely needed replacing.  We took the vehicle back to Big Star, after a couple of days we went to Big Star and were told the transmission was the culprit, even their mechanic came out and told us the transmission pressure was off causing the vibration and it was the problem all along.  Big Star said they were going to put a new transmission with a  3 yr warranty and that we would be better off with the deal.  After almost a month and many calls to Big Star for updates, we finally got the vehicle back.  We requested documents on the work, but had to go back to Big Star to get them. Within a few days the vehicle started making noise once again, and began getting worse.  Upon inspection of the documents we had to go obtain, I noticed the transmission was obtained from Parts Unlimited, once I looked them up I realized they were a Salvage yard in Pearland.  I called Parts Unlimited and asked if they sold re- built or new transmissions, they said no were are a junk yard!  As it turned out, it was obvious Big Star had put not one but two junk yard transmissions in our car, the first one burnt up on the mechanic when hevtest drove it.  That's probably why they had the car for a month to do the repair.  With all of this, we went to Big Star and asked for them to take the vehicle back. And refund if not all , but a acceptable portion of the purchase price.  The Sales Manager understood, however the GM would not agree to taking the vehicle back, unless we were willing to get another vehicle from Big Star.  I explained we no longer had trust in Big Star Sales or the Service group and wished not to do business w them any longer.  Big Star still would not agree to take the vehicle back that they touted had gone through their Service center for inspection prior to being placed on their lot for sale.  Ultimately, I elected to take a loss of about $4 on the Focus and went elsewhere to purchase my wife a replacement vehicle.  I am sharing my story as a simple caution to those considering Big Star used vehicles or using their Service center. ",1.4

259,"June 02, 2015","Last Thursday (5/28/15) I sent an email to Big Star about a 2015 Ford F-150 that they had on their website and asked if it was still available.  I quickly received a response from Diana saying it was available and she asked when I could come down to the dealer.  I exchanged a few more emails with Diana asking her several questions but never really got an answer to my questions.  I ended up making an appointment to visit the dealer on a Friday (5/29/15).  I went to the dealer and ended up dealing with Ray and one of their sales managers (Bobby I think).  We discussed what I was looking for and they took me for a test drive.  I loved the vehicle and told them I wanted to make a deal if I got the right price for my trade-in.  So while they were evaluating my trade-in Ray searched for vehicles that had the options that I was looking for and found 3 in the area.  They came back with an offer for my trade-in that was $2000 less then a I wanted.  After talking for a few minutes the sales manager said he would find a way give me what I wanted.  And told Ray to ""go make it happen"".  I left the dealership thinking we could make a deal and I was also impressed at how helpful Ray and the sales manager were...  I thought it was a pleasant experiance.  I was expecting a call from Ray on Saturday (5/30/15) with an update on the vehicle I was looking for...  I never received a call from Ray.  Instead I got a call from Diana asking how my meeting went on Friday,  I told her what was going on and she said she would follow up with Ray and call me back...  she never called back.  So on the following Monday (6/1/15) I called Ray around noon, he didn't answer so I left a message.  I then called Diana and asked her if she talked with Ray...  she said she sent him an email and then proceeded to check her email to see if he replied...  he didn't.  Not sure why she didn't go find Ray if she planned to me call back.  Diana said she would go talk with Ray and call me back in 10 minutes...  she didn't (do you see a trend here?).  So later that afternoon I sent Ray an email (I used the email on his business card) and I immediately go his email kicked back because it was an invalid email address.  So then I sent Diana another email and she did reply and said that she talked with Ray and he was planning to call me and she would follow up with Ray to make sure he called...  he didn't.  Tuesday morning (6/2/15) I called Ray again and left a message and of course I didn't get call back.  I sent Diana another email and didn't get a reply for her.  So I sent the GM, David Premazon, an email asking for a response from his sales team and as of now no response from David.

So this now leads me into another bad experience that I had with Big Star last May of 2014.  I went into the dealer on a Saturday, I was looking for a 2014 Ford Explorer. I was dealing with Jacques.  I told him what I wanted and he found it at another dealer.  We proceed to make the deal, I went through financing and  singed all of the loan paperwork.  They had to pick up the car at another dealer and said it should back at Big star on a Monday but I couldn't pick it up until Tuesday because I wanted window tint and they needed time to install it.  I was OK with that and I left my trade-in at the dealer and they gave me a loaner.  So on Monday I called to see if they if they picked up the car and I was told it wasn't there yet.  I called back on Tuesday and I was told that the car I purchased had already been sold.  Keep in mind I had already completed all the financial paperwork (which included the VIN #) for the new car.  I was not happy and told them I am coming back to pickup the car I was trading in.  I arrived at the dealer and they made me wait for about 20 minutes and then came back and told me my trade in was sent to another dealer to sell.  I was furious!  They said they would call the dealer and have them bring it back... took about 2 hours.  Finally I got my trade in back, and it still had my original plates on the car as well as 300 extra miles that they put on it.  So before I left I spoke with the new GM, David Premazon, and he apologized and said he would fix it.  So eventually they found an explorer that was similar to the one I thought I purchased and said it was on a truck and should be at the dealer within a week.  I called back in a week and was told it would another few days, and then another few days, and then another few days...  and on and on.  After all the runaround I then gave up.

So after my first bad experience I should have learned my lesson and I should have never returned to Big Star.  They only reason I gave them a second chance was because they had a new GM I was hoping things would be different under new management.  Wish I would have found this site before I went back the 2nd time...Stupid me!  I see replies to the negative reviews telling you to contact the customer service manager so they can make it right but they actually do that?  They should make it right the first time. ",1.0

265,"April 18, 2015","Classic bait & switch + false advertising with this car dealership.  Big Star Ford advertised a price of $27,612 online for 2013 Ford Explorer Limited only to balk and insult me when I actually offered to pay that price.  When I was ready to close the deal, Sales Manager Sky DeJohn nastily told me that now they wanted more for the car b/c of all the work that would need to be done to get the car ready to sell - that they were being “billed by their service department” and would need to increase the price on the car to recoup some of this expense.

However, the only thing Sky could actually come up with when I asked what work needed to been done was the replacement of the driver & passenger side headrests that ""had been stolen from the car"" while on their lot. (Oddly, this was NOT what he'd told me when I first inquired about the car a week earlier—his first story was the the prior owner of the vehicle wanted to keep the DVD headrests when he traded the car in, and the price online was for the car w/ regular headrests.)   

Despite Sky’s ugliness and apparent deception, I tried to continue our conversation.  I fully expected we’d be able to reach an agreement on price b/c frankly, I didn’t need them to replace the headsets (I’d planned on having aftermarket DVD headrests put in after I purchased the vehicle anyway) and was still interested in the car at the original price for which it was advertised, even without headrests.   But Sky couldn’t wait to blurt out that he “knew I wouldn’t be willing to pay the new price”, and finally told me the new price would be $30,612 - $3,000 more than the advertised price.  I replied that a) this was false advertising- the internet ad clearly showed/stated there were headrests included at the $27,612 price point, and b) his excuses for why the car had no headrests were inconsistent, and c) how on earth could a pair of headrests (without DVD players) be worth a $3000 hike??  

Sky then became very aggressive in his language and said “I’m not even going to deal with you.”  When I calmly replied that his deception and rudeness compelled me to leave a negative reviw online of my experience with Big Star Ford, he told me “I’m not gonna talk to you any more b/c you’re threatening me.  The online price for the car is $30,612.”  I replied that I was actually on the Big Star Ford website at that very moment and the price actually showed $28,277.   Sky promptly hung up on me.  

I called the dealership back after this experience and asked to speak with the General Manager.  Sky’s language and hostility were completely uncalled for, but I wanted to give the General Manager, David Premozan (sp?) a chance to make it right or at least let him know what goes on in his dealership.  Clearly David is cut from the same cloth as Sky, as I received no return phone call after I left a message.  

I’m sure there are honest, decent used car salesmen out there in the world, but I’d caution prospective buyers to steer clear of Big Star Ford.  I’ll be taking my business elsewhere and urge you to do the same.  ",1.0

The appointment was for 7:00 am and my wife took it in for me. At 11:30 I got a call from Dawn who was at lunch and talking to me through a mouthful of food that they couldn't find the wheel lock tool. At some point in the past, a mechanic who had rotated the tires didn't put the tool back in the console and so they cannot get the tires off to rotate them. Even though I have paid for tire rotations, I have not gotten them. In this instance, I didn't need nor ask for an oil change and tire rotation. Dawn decided I needed it more than I needed the repairs I took the car in for, and they never got to them. When I complained to Brian that I had scheduled an appointment at 7:00 am, he informed me that just because it was scheduled at 7:00 am didn't mean it would actually be worked on at 7:00. In the meantime they managed to get one wheel lock off and then failed to put it back on. I now have four lug nuts on the right front instead of five. They also changed the air filter and now the engine is running rough. Gas mileage has dropped.

284,"November 14, 2014","A. Collado,
I worked with Mr. Derek Frank and Mr. Sky DeJohn. Both were close to me in making sure I got the car I was looking within my budget.  I see opportunities with the customer service. The advertised internet price end up with a high value as they start to introduce, by default, cost related with the car inspection, plus the additional coverages they offer (which by the way has a different name like accesories, etc). Base on my experience, I recommend to read with attention the final number they present to you. In my opinion, they should advertise in the internet the real final price they will offer (specific with the recharges for certified cars, etc). There are hidden costs in my opinion. Took to me over 6 hours to close a deal because of these situation, until somebody was able to listen to my needs.  Any customer is different, and the customer service team (specific the sales department) should worked on the attention to details specific to the customer they are dealing with. Bottom line, I think Big Star Ford is a place to visit when looking for a pre-owned car. Do you pre-work and be prepared for a potential changes in final prices if you set your budget base on the internet price plus the mandatory TTL fees. Special thanks to the finance manager who explained several questions related with car garantees (that should be explained with the sales person in advance). ",3.8

I was told that BIG STAR does not handle FORD extended warranty and only WILL FIT Brand.  I explained that I had purchased the vehicle and the warranty at this location.  The explanation I got was that BIG STAR is not a authorized Ford Service center and could not help me with my request.

Secretly he knew I wouldn’t like it, but saw my determination to get that first car and rolled it around.  I disliked that particular car I had done research on.  Seconds after I returned from the test drive, he showed me the car that he knew I really wanted, the Ford Fusion.  I was crunched for time so they expedited my approval process on a Saturday.  I could have stayed and left with the car that day, but I wanted to go home, do my research on THIS car.  I requested expedited approval and paperwork on Monday.  I came in 4 hours before I said I would and the paperwork and car were still ready.  

The car I bought was a ford Fusion.  As I finalized my paperwork it was raining hard, Luis Mancinas had pulled my car right up onto the carport, CLOSE to the door.  I didn’t get a drop of water on me. 

The facility was professional.  The staff was friendly and forthright about everything.  I will be returning here for my next vehicle.  I also recommend  this dealership to anyone.

314,"April 11, 2014","I started shopping for a new Ford Escape in February and had narrowed my list of dealers based on internet reviews and a recommendation by a popular car enthusiast radio program.  Big Star Ford moved to the top of the list immediately in large part because of their prompt response to my online inquiry.  From there things moved quickly.  I met with Kim Srey, who did an outstanding job introducing me to the Escape and it's technology.  After a test drive we sat down and I laid out a detailed description of the vehicle I was looking for.  As it turned out the combination of options I wanted wasn't among the inventory Houston area dealers typically order.  So, the next step was to work out the details of a special factory order.  Kim and Ron Daniels were extremely helpful and willing to work with me to get the vehicle I wanted and in short order the process was underway.  I quickly had an acceptable price for the vehicle and the deal was on.  Over the following weeks, Kim and Ron kept me up to date on how the order was progressing, when the car would be built and delivered.  Did I mention it arrived sooner than originally projected?  All in all, ordering my new car was a great experience thanks to Kim and Ron.  They recognized immediately that I knew exactly what I wanted and they didn't try to sell me something else.  More importantly, they did what they said they would do and they did it when they said they would.

But wait, this pleasant experience didn't stop there.  When delivery day came, I was very pleased with the way the deal closed.  The paper work was settled quickly, the car was ready when promised.  But the best part was the time that John Taylor took going over a myriad of things I should know about the car and it's technology.  By the time John finished my orientation, I felt like I'd been through Top Gun school, but it was time well spent and very much appreciated.  After that I was off on my own, enjoying a great car.  It's now been two weeks since I took delivery, and I've received a call from someone at Big Star twice in that period asking how the car was doing and did I have any issues or questions.  So, the guys at Big Star do care about the sales they make and they prove it in ways like this.  If you're looking for a place to take your business, I would recommend you consider Big Star Ford.

About that dealer recommendation by the popular radio program.  Well, they managed to call me a few days after I ordered the car from Big Star.  Seems they were slow to respond because I wasn't shopping for something they had on their lot.  Their loss, but it all worked out because I made a great find in Big Star Ford.",5.0

Allowing the entire family to join in the tests drives and encouraging us to try every vehicle that we may have been interested in was huge. The only problem we had was the overwhelming smell of smoke in one of the used trucks. Not the salesman’s fault because the truck had just arrived.

That was not the case here. I bought a truck and a warranty and that was it. The only nerves I had through the entire time were what was my interest rate and it turned out better than I thought AND we got more than we expected on our trade in. We went later in the evening on a Friday and in total spent maybe a total of 2 hours or a tad bit more from test drive to getting the keys. The drive to Manvel from Katy was worth it.

We wanted to thank you for taking the time to respond to my online inquiry and deal with us without all the usual ""circus"" tactics.  We went to a friend's dealership, he's a service guy, to purchase our Fusion and I was actually responding to you to compare pricing.  In the end we decided to come see you because of all the help you had given us throughout the day.  I had told you that we were at a friends delearship and I was checking around, but you didn't bat an eye and gladly helped and answered all of my questions and looked for a car to fit our needs.  We are glad we came in and will be long time customers.  Once we got a deal ready your finance department went to work, as we were first time buyers it's a little more difficult.  They stayed late for us, but suggested we let them try first thing in the morning to avoid all the automated responses, well it was worth it, as they got us a great rate!  Your whole staff was friendly and professional and we appreciate that, as it is not always the case when buying a car.  We will be long time customers!

We were very impressed with the level of service provided us by each person we met in the sales chain. First there was no pressure from any individual to make the sale, but rather to educate and inform us about the dealership and the services offered.  We were under time constraints due to the holiday season and needed this to be seamless and timely.  The dealership was able to expedite the process with people who were very professional and organized.  It was very nice to speak directly with the GM who adds value by walking the floor and interacting with staff and clients on daily basis.  We have followed up with them after the sale on a few technology questions and been afforded quick and friendly responses.  We appreciate doing business with people in our neighborhood who can add value by simply going the extra step to service the client.  Good service is always good business.",5.0
338,"January 19, 2014","Absolutely beyond satisfied with my new car buying experience at Big Star Ford with Sky, John and multiple others along the way! After a five minute conversation with Sky on the phone, I let him know what I wanted at specific price point and if he could make it work, I'd be there in an hour to get the process started. After crunching numbers and utilizing his resources, Sky was able to get my my new (loaded) Ford Edge within $8 of my budget AND many laughs along the way.

From the first time you walk through the dealership doors, you immediately feel at home (as much as you can when your signing your life away to a $30,000 plus vehicle). All of the staff is extremely friendly and had more conversations with a little of everyone than I had in a prior dealership experience. Overall, every step of the way was guided by an extremely knowledgeable individual through picking out the car (although I had that down before I walked through the door), financing, about all the extras Ford offers and how to walk through the Ford Sync program!

After telling Louis the type of truck I wanted and the features I wanted on a truck, Louis began his search of dealerships throughout the state.

Louis kept me apprised of the status of his search and promptly notified me when he had located the truck with the features I desired.  Louis set about getting the truck moved from a Fort Worth dealership to Big Star Ford and kept me informed every step of the way.

Lou never tried to push us into looking at anything above our budget and he took the time to talk to me, not just my husband, because he wanted for me to be happy with our selection.  When we started the negotiations, there were never any hidden prerequisites for the discounts.  Lou and Rick went above their duty to make sure we were given the best price and interest rate for our vehicle.  We went in there with a preapproved rate and ended up with a lower one.

351,"December 16, 2013"," I want to start by saying the reason for buying the F150 was my F350 was stolen over the Thanksgiving holiday in south Texas.  After Thanksgiving I got a rental car to drive my wife, step son and black lab back to Florida with a short stop in Houston.  I called Big Star Ford on my way into Houston and on the other end of the phone was Lou.  I explained my situation and gave him my criteria for the type of truck I wanted.  He researched the in stock vehicles and returned my call promptly.  Once he confirmed he had a truck in stock that matched my criteria, I made an appointment to view the vehicle.   I arrived at the dealership about two hours after and he had the vehicle pulled up and ready for a test drive.  Once I drove the vehicle, I knew I had to have it.  I then told Lou I wanted to proceed with the negotiations, but did not want to haggle and instead wanted a bottom line price.  He approached Bert Sadler with the request and with very little back and forth, Bert came over and we were able to make a deal.
	I want to say a very sincere thanks to the Lou and Bert for understanding my situation and being able to accommodate my need for a vehicle on my terms.   What I can’t stress enough is that Lou listened to what my needs were and went out of his way to ensure they were met.
