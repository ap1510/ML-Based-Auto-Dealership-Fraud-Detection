7,"September 05, 2019","My experience at Mike Smith Honda was great!!! Steve was the best, he didn't try and push a car on me I didn't want. I was on a tight budget and he worked with it! I got there around 4:30pm and was on my way home in my new car around 7pm! I had shopped at another Honda dealership before I came here and wasn't happy with their way of trying to make me happy. I was paying cash and had a certain amount and the other dealership constantly tried to get me to do a ""small loan"". Granted Steve offered me that but when I told him it wasn't an option he didn't push me but found me the perfect car for me! Mike Smith Honda made this girl, one happy momma!!!",5.0

9,"March 02, 2019","Thanks to all involved in making my experience in purchasing my Jeep Unlimited a wonderful one.  It has been many years since I have dealt with a dealership, because of all of the hassle and negotiations that go along with it.  But this was truly a hassle free one.  I stated where I needed the ""Out the door"" price to be, and what I needed my payments to be, and we were in business.  I picked it up the next day.  Thanks again Mike Smith Honda of Beaumont TX.",4.6

12,"June 29, 2017",We just moved to he Beaumont area and had to bring in our Honda Odyssey for service upon moving here. We have always had a great experience with Honda but this was not. It took 3 different times to fix the initial problem and the service person was rude and seemingly uncaring about our situation. She was never friendly and seemed annoyed that we had to return. We needed up buying a new Honda and drove to Houston to do it. I would not recommend them and will not be taking mg new Honda to their dealership for any seevixe. They only positive thing I will say is that they did not charge me for the follow up visits. I atleast appreciated that,1.6
13,"April 18, 2017","My 2011 CRV was taken in for the front air inflators to be replaced, told it would take three hours, about two and a half hours later I received a phone call that it was ready, also received an email shortly after that saying that it was ready. The not only replaced the inflators but did a multipoint inspection and washed and vacuumed the car.",5.0
14,"October 28, 2014","As long as you are buying a car the experience is great. But if you need service after the purchase good luck. A ""we will call you in 15 min"" will turn into your so called customer service rep forgetting about you. Until you come in after an hour to check on it. It takes them 1 hour n 40 min for a simple tire change. And to top it off the technician can't program a simple light tire sensor..for this staff your time is not important they tell you 5 min it turns into 20

15,"July 02, 2014",My Salesman David Burleson got me just what I wanted!  Chris the Manager explained everything we ask him in a very nice and helpful way!  A Sales person named Kathy went out of her way to help us...and I appreciated that! ,5.0
16,"December 02, 2013",Excellent service. We were traveling far &  they got us right in and back on the road in no time PLUS washed &  vacuumed our car. Definitely recommend this dealer. ,5.0
17,"July 21, 2009","I have been to Mike Smith Honda for three visits. And on all three visits I am shocked at the level of immaturity.  The first two times I watched as they talked down to and insulted customers.  My first visit included one of the service writters verbally abusing the customer on the phone followed by a tirade of insults that would make a trucker blush after she hung-up.  Simply put they are rude and unporofessional! They do not return phone calls.  And when you finally get them on the phone they have a bunch of excuses for why the car is not ready when it was promised.  And of course, while they are on the phone they are rude.  I was be ashamed to be associated with Mike Smith Honda.  They will never get any of our business again!",1.5
