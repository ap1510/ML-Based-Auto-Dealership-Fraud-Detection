71,"January 09, 2020","Let me preface by saying that Charlie Baze is not your typical car salesman. I purchased a BMW from him after many months of shopping for a new car in the Austin area (and beyond), and a major reason why I ultimately bought a BMW from Charlie is because he takes a genuine and thoughtful approach to meeting, and anticipating, his customers' needs, and keeps the fun and excitement of car buying alive by abstaining from high-pressure sales nonsense but rather focusing on showing options, let the customer see and try them, and helping to understand and rationalize them, allowing the customer to digest and ultimately make a sound decision to ensure long-term happiness with the purchasing decision.",5.0

130,"April 03, 2019","

	I bought a car from the used lot with the top tier insurance they sell which is suppose to cover everything. Low and behold does not, the car was about to give and didn’t cover a single thing. So I spoke the used lot manager who told me to come in the next day and he’d buy the car back for what I owed on it as long as I committed to buying another used car from the lot. I show up the next day which ends up being his day off!



	So i proceed to take it up with management on the new car lot side, they said they would try to get him on the phone but in the meantime asked if they could interest me in purchasing a new vehicle with the same promise(outstanding balance on vehicle as long as I purchased a vehicle with them). I asked how fast this process would take after I chose a new vehicle(promised 2-3hrs), hours later they said I couldn’t take the vehicle I wanted unless I left something down. I was at my wits end because I said before we went down this process very adamantly I didn’t want to leave anything down.



	So then they proceed to try and sell me a service vehicle(so i wouldn’t have to leave DP), at a discounted price since its practically new but not. Well hours later(7 hrs into process) time to sign paperwork and come to find the  paper work is not only asking full sticker price for vehicle but also they don’t want to give me what i owed on used vehicle. They said they just simply couldn’t do that since I wasn’t leaving anything down.  At that time used car lot manager was found and was on speaker phone with me and sales rep at new car lot saying he never promised me full price for used vehicle. After being worn down and full of desperation to get my vehicle situation resolved, I purchase the new-ish car.



	Forwards months later for service, i left an expensive jacket in loaner car or lobby and the service manager says he can’t do anything for me because the cameras are just for show and don’t really work.

145,"January 07, 2019","I was looking for a new car and had looked on line at several different makes and models. The only car I found that had all the options and features I wanted and that I liked was a BMW X3. Based on my experience buying cars in the past (last one less that a year ago) I was expecting the typical high pressure sales experience. 

Was I ever surprised. 

I walked in the door of the BMW of Austin on McNeil and nobody bothered me. I spent a long time looking at and sitting in various models and still nobody bothered me. When I finished looking I had a few questions and went over to receptionist and was greeted and asked if I was working with a salesman yet and when I said no they paged for someone to assist me. 

The salesman I met, Charlie Baze, was actually the internet sales manager and he was very helpful and answered all my question. It turned out that an X3 with the options/features I was interested in was not available anywhere in the US. No pressure was put on me to buy what was on their lot or any lot anywhere. I was told that I could order the X3 I wanted from the factory North Carolina and it should arrive in 3-4 weeks.

I told them I would have to think about it, again no pressure was put on me to mind my mind up right away. I came home and thought about it overnight while I built multiple X3 cars with various exterior colors, interiors and other options. I finally decided to pull the trigger and contacted Charlie about when I should come in to order. He told me to just email him the build ID for the car I had built online and he would order it. WOW that was making it really easy on me so I sent it to him.

It took a few days to get it ordered (Thanksgiving got in the way...) but once ordered Charlie told me how to track the car through production and shipping. Was I ever surprised how easy that was also. 

The car was delivered in the 3-4 weeks from the time I ordered it. Picking it up was just as easy. 

I’ve been driving it for about 3 weeks now and I’m really happy with the car and all the people at BMW of Austin.

They then seemed to make it right by transferring my very large down payment into another car on the lot. At this point I was very hesitant to buy another car from them, but I didn't have a choice. I searched for a month to find one and finally settled on a CPO because I was told that it would extend the factory bumper to bumper warranty out to 75,000 miles. 

I brought it in to check the breaks, which I've been complaining about since I bought the car, a year ago, and they let me know that CPO doesn't cover anything other than the engine and transmission. So, I inquire about the coverage that I have with the maintenance warranty that I purchased because of the promise that it covered breaks. It only covers pads! 

So, if you want cars with issues and you have to fight to get anything done with your superior driving machine.... Come here! You are garunteed a headache, stress, and a healthy dose of lies.

I had already done some online research on what I wanted (CPO X3).  Roy put me into a grey X3, told me to go drive it, use the Sport mode, and put it thru it's paces.  After the first test drive, I mentioned that I'd like to find a car with a sun roof and satellite radio.  In minutes Roy had me behind the wheel of exactly what I was looking for.  Another 30 minute test drive, and I knew this was the car that I wanted.  I went by the house to pick up the car title for my trade in, and by the time I got back to the dealer, all the paper work was ready.  Total transaction time was about 30 minutes.

Had a car custom built- CHRISTOPHER MARKEY is fabulous; he had it done in no time, made the paperwork simple and easy, returned calls and emails immediately; answered everything clearly and never felt like he was a ""typical shady car salesman""
TROY MASSEY - was the gentleman I dealt with while in the office. I cannot say enough good things about him. He went above and beyond at every turn. He is the ONLY person besides CHRISTOPHER MARKEY that I would deal with.
I have driven BMWs for over a decade and have bought from the best dealerships in the country; these two gentlemen are more than 5 stars and they are the reason I now do and will continue to do business with BMW of Austin It took these two gentleman and a lot of effort to overcome a couple of very very negative experiences here; that I would now highly recommend BMW AUSTIN. Everyone there; from Shane at the front desk (who is amazing)  to Mr, Wheelock in finance, to Kaitlin the BMW ""Genius"" that is not only smart but also kind; they were so great we went back the next day and got a 2nd BMW. 😊

Jess Rolan (new vehicles sales manager) is a xxxxx and a disgusting human being.
John Dickerson-(client advisor) is rude, aggressive and condescending

281,"August 08, 2016","I can't say enough nice things about BMW of Austin.  Their professionalism, their service, and their desire to make buying a vehicle seamless.  First of all I was looking at Audi, BMW and Volvo.  I have to say Troy Massey is what every dealership should have in a sales consultant but doesn't!  The more I talked with Troy, the more I was moving toward BMW. He went through all the details and never left anything to guess.  I decided to order a BMW when I didn't find the right X1 I wanted on the lot.  Troy updated me every step of the way!  He emailed when it was on the assembly line.  When it was done with paint and headed to the port, when it was crossing the ocean to having arrived at the port...and finally when to expect it in Austin!  Troy even sent me the VIN number so I could have my car insurance ready. Then the gentleman who explained my lease, Brett Swanson was THE FIRST car financial rep I'd ever experienced of not trying to oversell all the options to be added to the lease.  I was gritting my teeth expecting it to be a painful process (Most dealerships try to take advantage of female buyers) but Brett didn't move through everything at a fast pace trying to get me confused and to sign off on added options.  He was honest, direct, and explained each option and why.  When I didn't want an option he accepted the ""No"" and didn't try to press it.  Next it was on to taking possession where, Maja Guiamelon guided me through the vehicle and it's workings.  She went through the car and answered all my questions and never once seemed impatient which is impressive when you think about it. She took all the time needed, plus BMW Austin has a follow up appointment to go over any questions you have after you've had a few weeks to drive your new vehicle.

Well - he called the next day and located my car ""on the boat"" - I had to wait about  a week and half (I was in no hurry) - but he got it here and I picked it up all ready to go - 0 miles; tinted windows -- which I realize is pretty standard -- but Troy - and really everyone from the front desk to the financing guy to the gal that went over all the features with me - everyone was super nice, super accommodating and sure to make me feel welcome and said ""thank you for my business"". -- My first experience buying/driving a BMW and I don't regret a thing!! - Good stuff :)",4.8

I thought everything was fine until I took the car to a body shop since BMW of Austin doesn't do body work. The body shop said BMW of Austin missed some mechanical work and were also holding onto some funds from All State and that BMW of Austin would not return their phone calls. I had to make several phone calls and get an All State manager involved in order to get those funds returned. The service advisor said ""I didn't talk to the shop"" and ""maybe the additional damage was done after we did our work"". The service manager responded with ""sorry you're having problems"" and ""I don't know what happened, maybe it's the accounting departments fault"". A second email from the manager resulted in ""the accounting department has no record of any discrepancy"" I find that difficult to believe after what I was told by both All State and the body shop. At no point in time did the dealership take ownership of the problem on any level. They gave me zero reassurance that this was a fluke and that the process to resolve these issues will be examined. Worst of all, they lacked the decency to give a sincere apology for at the very least delaying my repairs for a week. ",1.0

301,"January 09, 2016","3 yrs ago I called BMW of Austin. I explained the car we wanted, went through all the options, and my sales person quoted a price. I didn't negotiate as it was one of my first leasing experiences. Now our lease is coming due and we want the same car, just a 2016 model (now the 340i which is exactly the same price).

I called my sales person, gave him the specs and asked if we could reduce the down payment and monthly price since we are current lessees. He e-mails a quote with a car that doesn't match for a price that is substantially higher than our current payment. I respond and ask him to please quote the exact vehicle we discussed. The next quote says ""with those options your payment will be over $800"". $800!!!! That's almost $200 more than our current payment. My wife and I jumped online and started doing some research.

Turns out we way overpaid on our current lease and foolishly trusted our sales person was giving us a good deal. Wrong!

I e-mailed our sales person and explained that I couldn't understand how the price could be so much higher. Again, I get the runaround and one meaningless explanation after another. I e-mailed back and said that I was going to shop other dealers. We'll call the other dealer the ""competitor"".

I spoke with the competitor and they asked me for all the details of the car and our down payment, and immediately gave me back a price of $641 (same amount down as the dealer). $641???? Wait a second, didn't our sales person tell me it would be over $800? Btw, the competitor was going through BMW Financial Services (same as the dealer) and was even offering me the same current lessee BMW special.

Once again I e-mailed our sales person and provided all the numbers of the competitor's offer. The one thing we wouldn't get, that BMW of Austin provided last time, was having our windows tinted. We found it cost around $300. So, I offered a deal. If he could beat the competitor's offer and include the window tinting, we would do the deal through BMW of Austin.

Back and forth, e-mail after e-mail, repeated questioning from our sales person over the validity of the competitor's offer (even though I offered to show him the paperwork), and false confusion over how they were able to offer me that price. The answer? They weren't adding in tons of hidden costs (more on this in a bit).

The last e-mail I received magically reduced his offer to $25 more on the down payment and $667/mo, with a closing sentence of ""Hope this earns your business"". Earns my business? I'm the one who had to do all the leg work and basically beg BMW of Austin for a reasonable lease deal, and yet somehow with a higher lease price offered to me that's supposed to ""earn my business""?

I e-mailed back and repeated once again all the numbers (down payment and price per month) we are currently being offered through the competitor, and stated very clearly, ""If you can beat this deal and include the window tinting, I will do the deal through BMW of Austin"". No response.

The next day I followed up with a call and he says he hasn't responded because he's been going through this deal and what he's come up with.... wait for it........ are the same numbers he already e-mailed me about the day before. I said, ""You e-mailed that to me yesterday"". He says, ""Yeah, I don't know how they are doing what they are doing for you, but if that's their offer I guess we'll have to pass.""

I said I couldn't believe that his manager would let an existing customer walk away over $26/mo and a $25 difference on the down payment, and he said he would call me back after speaking with the ""powers that be"".

He called and said the best they would do would be $662/mo with no change in the down payment. ""Why would I pay around $600 more over the course of the lease to do business with him, especially after I've had to go 10 rounds just to get to this point""?

Again, I read him the numbers, and said I couldn't understand how he isn't getting the exact same price per month? He questioned the price I gave him and said he is already ""well below that price"". Well below? That would mean the price per month should be lower!

Then he proceeds to tell me all these hidden costs (equating to hundreds of dollars) he is adding in, and I said ""Wait, I have my current lease paperwork right here and none of those costs are listed"". His response?

""We don't disclose all the costs on leases like we do on purchases. It's different paperwork.""

So, BMW of Austin just told a customer that they charge a bunch of hidden fees and build it into the price of the car without disclosing those ""non-car"" costs to the customer. Can anyone say illegal?

I asked for his manager and was told he would call me back. I e-mailed him this review and said I hope he will make this right. His response said he wouldn't do anything else for me and used scare tactics regarding going with another dealer or the competitor.

I have a good relationship with my service guy but as far as sales? RUN!",1.8

I test drove cars, etc & although my schedule is hectic from work Troy made certain to communicate with me via email as I requested to get certain things done.

I wanted a tint & no problem Troy saw to it that it was done before I picked the car up. I was also surprised that the night of delivery I was not just signing & told goodbye but received a tutorial from an awesome guy who helped me synch my phone & my favorite radio stations.

We arrived today at 130 and explained the situation. We asked if we should leave the car or wait. We were told it wouldn't take long, we should wait. We did. For 2 hours. We checked periodically to see what was happening. We never got an answer other than it wouldn't be long and they would find the guy who was working on it. At 330, we still had no answers, and the man who took our car had still not been located. We said we just wanted our car back. We then found out that no one had even looked at the car yet. Again, we said we just wanted our car back. We were assured it was on its way and would be there in a few minutes. We continued to wait. At 400, a different man pulled our car up.

What I found instead was a great and straight forward salesman, Charles Graham, that went above and beyond to make a great sale happen on what is honestly a low price car.  Even though he didn't have to, he even went so far as to have a dent repair guy touch up part of the car without even asking or charging for it.  All around this was a fantastic experience all the way to financing which was nice and fast without a lot of fuss.

On Friday afternoon after not hearing from him on Wed, or Thursday,  I called him, and  was delayed in talking to him, and then after a wait, I called him back.  BMW should be able to build a car that has replaceable head lights, but not BMW. The first time that I had to replace one, it cost $138 in labor because they had to ""loosen the bumper"" to replace the bulb. Okay that was bad, but since both headlights were being replaced, I went along with the $38.00 charge for the bulb, and the $138 in labor. Then 3 about 4 months later, the other low beam went out, and I took it back. New charge to replace the bulb: $371.00. Also BMW has warning lights for everything, but the problem is that the warning system isn't covered by the warranty. SO a light indicator that says its can not express an opinion about my tire pressure was going to cost me  $281.00 to replace. I am very disappointed in Kyle, BMW, and the Austin BMW dealership.

I had contacted Troy Massey via the internet link the day before, to find out availability of a BMW i was looking for.  He emailed me that night and told me to drop by the next day.  

I arrived and Troy had printed 3 different sheets of information on cars that I was interested it.  He let me look them over for the options that were in each and told me to let him know which one I wanted to take for a test drive.  

Troy brought the car to me, took ac copy of my license and insurance information and let me do a test drive.   He gave me a quick overview of the features in the car before I left the BMW lot.  There was no pressure on me.  Told me to take it out for as long as i wanted to check out the car and run i through its paces.  

The rest of my experience at BMW of Austin, was more of the same.  There was no pressure tactics to buy the car.  Everything seemed like they were trying to make me as comfortable as they could with the purchase decision I was trying to make.  After we settled on the Car price and financing, they asked us to return the next day and they would have everything ready.  

When my wife and I arrived the next day at our agreed upon time, We were treated very well.  Troy started off showing us the Service area, the lobby is so clean and modern looking, there is a movie theater with stadium seating, to watch a movie while you wait.  So customer service oriented it was scary.  Can't wait to take my BMW in for its first service.

 We were given about a 40 min overview of all the features of the car. The Satellite radio was already setup, they synced my iPhone with the onboard Bluetooth.  Showed us how to use the iDrive system.  Just a fantastic experience on the capabilities of all the features included with the vehicle.  

We then went into the BMW office and were then directed to complete all the paper work.  Again, a painless experience.  During all this time, whenever our 8 y/o daughter needed to be entertained, Troy provided distractions for her (coloring books, playing with toys, helping stack papers) and just finding fun things to do, it was very nice for her and not feeling bored during our time there finalizing our purchase.

He is also very patient to show different options/color exterior or interior ... Generally I am very satisfied with my car (I bought a 320i, mineral grey), and I am happy with his consulting.

I didn't walk in knowing exactly what model I wanted, but the sales rep, Mike Hanaway, was very pateint in working with me during a couple of visits, encouraging me to test drive the models I seemed interested in.  His deep knowledge of the BMW cars was very helpful in allowing me to understand exactly what I'd be getting for my money.  Once I decided exactly what I wanted, that particular model and set of options was not actually on thier lot or any nearby dealerships.   But through Mike's diligence, he found one on a ship making it's way to the U.S.   Mike redirected that car to Austin, keeping me aprised of it's status along the way.  Soon, I was driving off the lot in just the right BMW and I'm loving the car!  Furthermore, I was very pleased with how Mike worked with me on the price as well as what he was able to get me for my trade-in.  Finally, Mike has stayed in touch with me after the delivery, making sure I know that if I have any questions or there is anything else he can do for me all I need to do is call.

375,"June 05, 2013","I bought a new fully loaded 2013 Z4 35is from them recently and have used their service department for the last year. First off, I highly recommend using Troy Massey as your sales associate. There are good car salesman and bad salesman in every dealership and the reviews will always reflect that so if you see a bad review trust me it was probably just a single bad experience. Get with Troy and he'll take care of you and you can trust him with all your car buying needs whether it's new or used. His contact information is below the review. 

Overall my experience has been amazing at BMW of Austin. The service department always provided me with a brand new loaner car for anything from an oil change to services, and even my quarterly detailing. I walked in here a few weeks ago to buy a used Z4 and Troy cut me such a good deal on a new Z4, that I would have been an idiot to buy the used car. He is probably the best car salesman I have ever worked with and I have bought a lot of cars so check this place out and they'll work with you. If you want a contact in the service department, get with Andy.

377,"May 23, 2013","I became hooked on BMW Austin through their maintenance department.  The maintenance department at the BMW dealer in Temple was closer, but they lied to us on two separate occasions and caused us to switch.  Chris Brice was assigned to me at Austin BMW, and I have never been happier.  He always fixes our problems and treats us like royalty!

When it came time to replace our 325xi, we met Troy Massey in sales.  He put us into a 128i, which we dearly love.  Troy has followed up with us ever since, and we just purchased a X3 from him last week.  It is an unbelievable car and Troy has made sure that we got everything we expected, plus a lot more.

As the owner of my fifth BMW, and having had them serviced at five different BMW service center (to include two in Germany), I highly recommend BMW Austin.  From sales to service, they are the most outstanding BMW center you can find.

378,"May 16, 2013","I have owned many BMW's in the past and have never had the problems that I have had with BMW of Austin.  I purchased a new car from them and while my salesman, Mike, was great, the finance department was manipulative and deceitful.  

The service department is only interested in charging excessive fees and not fixing your problem.  My car has been mis-diagnosed numerous times...  I have paid excessively for work that was not needed and I have been stranded on the highway because of their work.  To top it all off, I still have a problem that they can't seem to resolve.  The latest is that they want to charge me $3000 for a repair BUT will not guarantee that it will fix the issue???

Management at  ""pre-owned"" sales is terrible!  When I decided to buy my leased vehicle we agreed to a price over the phone...  At the very last moment as I was signing the paperwork they tried to increase the price by $1500 saying that they mis-quoted me on the extended maintenance agreement... I couldn't believe it!  The manager began to argue with me for 30 minutes on the issue and in the end said that he intended to honor the original deal all along...  So he argued just for the fun of it?

I am so happy that my extended warranty has now expired because I will never buy another vehicle from this dealership and will never use their service department again!  I love BMW's but will never ever go back to BMW of Austin!",1.0

I put in an on-line ""dealer quote"" request from http://Edmonds.com, and within 30 minutes or so, Larry had emailed me a response and welcomed us to come by for a test drive - and he said that they had a few models in stock that matched our selection of colors and options. We initially test drove the 335i with the Sport Package, and we took it down the twisty, curvey Old Spicewood Springs Road to see how it handled and then up Loop 360 and back on Hwy 183 to see how it drove on the highway. It was VERY nice. We thanked Larry, and told him that we still needed to look at the other 3 cars on our shopping list - Acura TL, Lexus ES 350, and Infiniti G37 Journey. 

The Acura seems large and cumbersome in comparison to the BMW, the Lexus was very dissapointing - the car floated above the road, with very little ""connectedness"".  The Infiniti G37 Journey was very close, and we really liked the red color, but that only came with a black interior (we like in Austin, TX and it gets HOT in the summer). We were willing to ""put up with"" the black interior and sat down to start talking finances. The Infiniti dealer would offer us $10, 500 for the trade-in on our 2003 Infiniti G35 Coupe, which was $1500 to $2000 less than Edmonds claimed it was worth. We almost bought it, but decided to sleep on it.

That evening I sent Larry and email saying that we would like to test drive the less powerful 328i without the Sport Package, and mentioned that my wife was really leaning towards the red color (the Inifiniti looked great, and the BMW brochure that Larry gave us showed that the 3 series was available in red exterior, with TAN interior). Within minutes Larry emailed me back and said he has one in stock that matched that criteria and he would have it ready for us to test drive at 10 AM the next morning.

When we arrived at BMW of Austin the next morning, a light rain was falling, but Larry had the car ready for us to test drive. He insisted that we go our on the same test drive route, and to go by ourselves (he didn't need to go). OK, it's raining, and he just tells us to take off and enjoy our ride!

We loved the car, and it had more than enough power for my wife, so we sat down to talk business with Larry. First he got our Infiniti G35 Coupe appraised for trade-in. They offered $12,000. (Remember what the Infiniti dealer offered us for our Infiniti?) We said OK and worked up all the paperwork.

When we came back in 3 1/2 hours, the car had all the dealer prep, it was cleaned beyind perfection, and was sitting inside their showroom (it was still raining outside). While in the showroom, Larry explained a little of the features and gave us a nice introduction to the car.

They then pulled the car outside, where the satellite radio was activated and another person (Chris?) spent 20 or 30 minutes giving us a more thorough explanation of how all of the controls operated, and even set-up my BlackBerry for Bluetooth voice recognition!

Larry sent us an email 2 weeks later to say that our license plates were ready. My wife drove over and told that to someone in the Serice Department, and she said they were very polite and put them on without any delay.

In summary, the car purchasing experience at BMW of Austin was very straight-forward and pleasant. I would highly recommend them to anyone interested in this class of a vehicle!

424,"September 02, 2010","I recently bought a 2011 BMW 328i from John Dickerson at BMW of Austin and have nothing but great things to say about him and everyone I met at the dealership. I first met with John Dickerson at about noon and I was on my way with a handshake on a car by 3:00 that afternoon. John Dickerson knew I was also looking at other competitor's cars, so he worked the best deal to win my business. He also worked really hard to get me better trade dollars on my Acura. John knew we handle schedule conflicts, so he arranged for finance to meet me at 7:00 that night. He worked until the deal was done and we drove off - almost 9:00 that night. He answered all my questions about the car, and when it started to rain, John pulled my car from outside into the showroom while we finished up so I wouldn't have to drive away with other than a clean shiny car. We sat for almost two hours explaining the features of the car and doing the necessary preference adjustments. Yet, he was enthusiastic about doing so although it was late after closing hours. John Dickerson personally came to my house to assist me with my garage door link. I have already recommended BMW of Austin to my friends and will continue to do so.",5.0
425,"December 30, 2009","Took my 740IL in because it was sluggish and I smelled something burning. I was told that my manifold gasket was leaking and needed valves covers required replacement. I decided that the cost was too expensive and decided to do $2000 worth of work so that I could sell car without having to spend too much on repairs. Upon completion of work I noticed that drivers window wasn't working properly, radiator overflow was cracked and it still smelled of oil(neither was a concern with exception of oil smell). The engine was cleaned and supposedly new parts were installed. My neighbor is a mechainic who inspected auto and stated that parts charged for were not new and that old parts had been placed back on auto, they ripped me off.

426,"December 16, 2009",had to deal with this dealership for two years before we finally had enough! yes bmw has a warranty that covers all maintainance but my wife and i could not keep the damn car out of the service department. What a pain! besides the fact that whenever my wife had to bring the car in they treated her with total disrespect but were fine with me. We hated this dealership so much we traded our bmw in to MB of georgetown and purchased a MB. wow now they know how to treat their customers.,1.0
427,"December 16, 2009","By far and away this is the worst car experience I have had and that says a lot as I owned an XR4TI.

About one year after warranty two major failures occured within one week.  One is a proprietary ""computer"" malfunctions which can not be fixed except at a dealership, the other was a recall item that simply is not being honored by the dealership.  

When I droped off the car I did so with a diagnosis from a non-dealership mechanic saying that only the dealership has these parts and that they should, in his opinion, cover these items as they are manufacture failts.

A week later my service advisor called and said they fixed the recall issue and said noting else was wrong -but had to go on vacation - oh and I'm not eligible for the recall as its voluntary -- next the new advisor calls and says there is a computer malfunction that requires ""reprogramming of the entire car"" which is a small part piece and over $1000 in labor.  If not done, the car literally refuses to allow the lights to work.  Imagine trying to use the car without brake lights and turn signals.

I am in the tech business and this is a joke.  Basically it seems like the car is programmed to malfunction to jack up proprietary costs.  It seems the regular service for the 1st three years is a ploy to cover up the many faults these cars have. 

This was my second 700 series and I can tell you it will be my last.  No BMWs for me, or my family for the rest of our lives.

Oh, when the car went out of warranty I asked about buying an extended -- and they said that I could not, but I could buy a new car of course.

A true lux car dealer would have fixed such design/recall issues gratis or for a parts only fee, these guys are BAD BAD BAD. ",1.2
428,"January 20, 2009","I live in Houston, and this is my third BMW in 4 years.
My first BMW was bought from a Houston dealer, and the experience was fantastic. With that in mind, when a friend of mine decided to get an X5 in 2007, I went back the same dealership first- big disappoinment because the people I dealt with were no longer with that dealership.
I searched all the dealers in Houston for a good deal but could not put up with their arrogance. As a customer, I do not have to take rubbish to give someone my business, and this seems to be a problem with the dealerships in Houston
Called BMW of Austin and come to a working agreement over the phone.
My friend got his X5 in 2007, and I got mine by year end in 2007.
Fast forward to 2009, I just bought a new X6 from BMW Austin, and they were very respectively to me as a customer.

There are better advisors, stay away from this guy.  At least the facility and wait area is nice.",1.8
431,"November 08, 2008","The question should be ""would you recommend someone else?"". If you under warrantee, you'll have to pay. Money or travel time. John Roberts (may he rest in peace) did not run the previous dealership. He only dealt with problems when they would not go away. He had others who's agenda was go bring in money. BMW of Austin (Penske controlled) has a whole different approach. Customer approval. The agenda however is purely to make money. Being a publicly traded company, they owe their stock holders that. For those of you who do not understand how a dealership operates: The technicians usually get a commission. For those of you who receive this type of pay, you understand that good service brings good money. There is nothing dishonest about commission, that is until the rates get whacked when warrantee work is done. Most manufacturers will only pay about 75% of what a dealer would pay (and charge) for customer pay work. When BMW introduced ""free"" (if you believe it's free you probably also think you don't pay property tax if you rent instead of own your own home and if that's the case, you will just be happy thinking you are getting free service) they started handling the ""free"" services as warrantee. When BMW dealerships complained of lost income from customer pay work BMW produced a service bulletin that stated ""at least you get the work and the vehicles are kept out of independent shops"". This was their plan - not to offer something for free but to keep the work from independent shops. It did relieve the new car buyer of the chance to complain (after all, if you didn’t pay, you can’t get a refund) about how much service was and the interesting this is that even though that price is included in the price of the BMW, NO ONE complains about the price of the BMW. They just buy it. Some shop around like kids looking for a cheep switchblade knife on the boarder of Mexico with disregard for the fact that profit helps pay for those fancy amenities they turn around and enjoy. The problem arises is that when there is NO competition for the service while a vehicle is under warrantee - it tends to have an effect on quality. As long as it goes unnoticed by the consumer and it not complained about - there is no audit to check whether or not it was even done. If a tech that tries to slip one past someone and they get caught, the tech takes the beating but if the techs don't get caught and they crank out enormous amounts of billable ""hours"" (to BMW and to consumers) they celebrate and enjoy the profits (if profit is an appropriate word in this case). Once dealership technicians figure out ways to beat the clock with warrantee work (to try not to loose so much pay) they learn the tricks and it seems to carry over to customer pay work. Now please keep in mind - this practice is common but consumers do not always loose as a result of it. There are some darn good dealer techs and they do care a great deal about the quality of their work but in general - it might be worth having a talk with your personal technician as you would your doctor. Once these guys see there is a person behind the paycheck - eye contact goes a long ways towards quality and honesty. Another consideration - dealership or independent - it is not customary to ""tip"" a technician with money but trust this message when I say appreciation goes a long ways to keeping a smile on a techs face. Ever consider a thank you card? Some folks do and you can bet, the next time that tech gets ""your"" car, they will probably take extreme care and kind consideration towards recommendations of what work is needed and the quality that goes into their work. If they don't, request someone else. The techs also get a boost when they get another’s techs ""car"". It's all fair. I'll wrap up CAR REPAIR 101 with the fact that independent shops do not, even if it's extended warrantee coverage, have what dealer techs have to deal with when it comes to manufacturer warrantee pay (pay reductions). If you find an independent shop or at least a technician that specializes in your brand of automobile you can usually be assured of personal attention and your appreciation will more than likely be rewarded - plus independent techs on average get paid 20% more per hour and the shop rates are usually 20% less than dealers. By manufacturer agreements with the EPA - they release ALL of the same information to independent technicians as they do dealership technicians. www.NASTF.org will have some interesting information for enquiring minds. Now - the next time you post a comment about any business, ask yourself - did you tip your service person with appreciation, and if you think they did not deserve appreciation - then go somewhere else - if it is because something went wrong - dealership or independent - you can probably bet that whatever went wrong was not intentional so give them a chance to remedy the issue and if you think it was intentional - once again - get a different personal to handle your needs",2.6
432,"September 19, 2008","A simple job takes them over a week - and is typically not done right even then. I've taken my X5 in for its oil change service twice now - and each time - not only have they kept it WAAAAY longer than they estimated, but in the end - left the job undone.

Their typical pattern is calling you late evening - and leaving a voicemail about why your job could not be done - and some long winded explanation about the same. 

It looks like they are swamped - that much seems obvious - but I also think they are extremely inefficient (they order wrong parts - or they don't figure out the problem till very late into the week).
