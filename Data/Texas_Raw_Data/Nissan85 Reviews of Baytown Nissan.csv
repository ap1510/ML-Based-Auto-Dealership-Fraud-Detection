0,"May 12, 2020","I will never buy another car here let alone have my car serviced here. I had brought my car in last October to see why my car was making noises and after Baytown Nissan having my car for 4 or 5 days, they finally called me to inform me of the problem and an estimate of the cost. At the time of me dropping my car off Angie said that she would put me in a rental and that Nissan would cover the cost. I picked up the rental and after about 2 or 3 weeks I got a call that my car was ready. I went to pick it up and paid around 6 or $700 for the repairs and my car was in fact running worse than it was when I dropped it off and I then placed a call to Nissan in forming them of the problem and Angie then told me to bring my car back and she'll have the rental extended. I dropped my car back off and I find out that the ""certified Nissan mechanics"" hadn't even test drove it to see if it was fixed. They kept my car my car for another 2 weeks. After it was finally ready, I paid another $848 and dropped the rental off. Fast forward to February 2020, I received a bill from Enterprise Rental stating that I owe $1,023 for the rental in October and November. I immediately called the service manager Valeriani Fukuichi and was told he would look into the situation and would get back with me. In the meantime I called Enterprise and was told that Nissan said that I was responsible for this charge. A week or 2 goes by and nothing from Mr. Fukuichi. I called back, left a message and nothing. I called at least once a week and still he hasn't gotten back with me. It wasn't until Enterprise debited $500 from my account to satisfy some of the payment. I then went to Nissan to try to get this resolved since my calls weren't getting returned to which Mr. Fukuichi said his general manager said for him to do his due diligence and make a decision. Now I have my receipt stating that Baytown Nissan is to be billed for this rental and who to Attn: it to but now I get a call from Val saying that his GM will not pay for the rental. I will never ever return there for any type of service. His attitude was very disturbing, disgusting for the whole matter. He was not and could not be at least interested in anything that I had to say and I wonder if he treats all women like that. I will never buy another car from here. For him to state that Baytown Nissan is not making any money which has nothing to do with me.... I will not stop as I am not liable nor responsible for this. 
If I could give a negative star I would",1.0
1,"March 16, 2020","They do not honor their trade in car agreements. They are a scam and will raise the price for your new vehicle, and will have you thinking that everything is good when it’s not. Next, you start receiving phones calls from your last lender on the old car that was supposed to be used for the trade in and find out that your old car has not been paid off by the dealership. Now I’m stuck in a messy trade in car situation. My old lender now wants me to pay off balance for a settlement for the old car that I traded in years ago. Please keep your families and friends away from this dealership.",1.0
2,"February 27, 2020",I'm just graduating from college and I was looking around for a better car for my graduation present. I came to Baytown Nissan first and let me tell you it was the best experience I've had in a while. I had an amazing sales person that treated with the up most respect and put me in a car that I loved!! I went home with a 2020 Rogue Sport and I thank my salesman Jesus so much for helping me out! I recommend you go and ask for him if you are looking to buy a car lol I walked in there not expecting anything but Jesus really took care of me and my husband. He didn't pressure us into anything and throughout the whole thing I was happy to be here with the right people. My overall experience was amazing! I wouldn't have changed it for the world.,5.0
3,"January 19, 2020","DON’T GO TO BAYTOWN NISSAN!!! Baytown Nissan service department customer service is the WORST I’ve ever dealt with! I dropped off my husband’s truck off on Friday morning (1/17/20) at 7:30am for oil change, tire rotation and some warranty work that needed to be done. My husband (who is out of state working) received a text Friday night around 6:00 pm saying his truck was ready! He called when he received the text but was told the service dept was closed. So, he called Saturday (1/18/20) morning at 8:30am to verify it was indeed ready for pick up. He was told yes. Around 1:00 pm, I had my sister drop me off to pick up the truck. I went to the cashier, signed my paperwork, she gave me the copy and was told she couldn’t find my keys so she would go see where they were. I waited. She comes back, says it is getting washed and it would be a little while. I waited for about 15 minutes before I realized that my truck had been parked in the back “holding area” the whole time I was waiting and looking out the back window. I told the cashier that my truck was just sitting out there, not in the wash as she said it was. She proceeded to tell me that her manager Val told her that my husband had called 5 times in the last couple of days and he was told it wouldn’t be ready until 2pm. I told her that wasn’t true because we just dropped it off yesterday and he hasn’t called 5 times, he did call this morning and was told it was ready. She AGAIN told me “No, my manager told me your husband called 5 times and it’s not gonna be ready until 2pm.” I called my husband and he confirmed he only called 1 time today. My husband then said he was calling up to talk with the manager. I told her to just get my keys and her manager, I don’t want it washed! She went to tell him, and he comes in a few minutes later with a key fob and said he pulled my truck around and he had to pull it mid-wash because it wasn’t ready. I said MY truck is still sitting back here, I POINTED TO IT, and he said that’s not your truck! He said your truck was way back there in the wash area! I told him I wasn’t understanding what the problem and attitude was because we were told it was ready this morning! He said, “No you weren’t!” I said are you calling me a LIAR? He said, “I’m TELLING you I talked to your husband and told him it wouldn’t be ready until 2pm.” I said no sir you did not, and he continued to ARGUE with me. He said your husbands on hold now, I’ll tell him. So he put my husband on speakerphone and my husband could hear VAL arguing with me and said #1 you will not talk to my wife like that and #2 what is the xxxx problem because he talked to someone that said it was ready this morning! VAL told my husband he talked to him at 12:30pm and my husband told him he had only called at 8:30am this morning and DID NOT SPEAK at all to someone named VAL. Then Val said, “then who did I talk to?” I said EXACTLY!!! Who did you talk to? He then walked to his office to “check his notes”, I turned around to the drop off/pick up bay and didn’t even see my truck that he “pulled up”, so I clicked the unlock button on the key fob he had handed me and YEP, IT UNLOCKED A RED/MAROON TRUCK! I opened the door to his office and said THATS NOT EVEN MY xxxx TRUCK, MY TRUCK IS THE GREY ONE PARKED BACK THERE THAT YOU TOLD ME WASN’T MINE!!!
He goes, gets my truck and says sorry I got customers confused! I told him he could keep his xxxxing sorry’s because he should have gotten his xxxx straight before arguing with and calling his customers liars and I would be contacting his general manager!!! Both My husband and I called the GENERAL MANAGER JOEY YESTERDAY and an online chat with Nissan and STILL have not gotten a call back!!! Apparently, BAYTOWN NISSAN IS OK WITH IT'S CUSTOMERS BEING TREATED THIS WAY!!!",1.0

This month  I brought my car in to get service did not know their was  block on my account, service refused. I went to other nissan  problem solved no issues, > I was about to purchase another car that weekend for kiddo big mistake nissan baytown... and new manager claims cant get the block off or would not TRY...

False advertising

Please before going here call other dealers they have better prices lower than here or at least they are honest ",1.0
7,"June 29, 2019","First of all, I entered my information on the internet to see if the vehicle was still available and as expected I received a call from someone (I cannot remember the name) and was informed it was available. Once I arrived to the dealership I asked for the individual that called me and I never got to meet them. I was directed to another salesperson...and that is when things went downhill. We walked out to look at the vehicle that inquired about and the vehicle was a mess (dirty). There appeared to be no attempt to clean the vehicle prior to advertising it on the internet. Then came the time for the offer for my trade. I had been dealing with one salesperson at this point but as the offer for my trade was time to be announced to me, I was approached by the salesman, the sales manager and someone else. I pretty much knew by the way they approached me that the offer was going to be ridiculous and of course it was. I politely told them no thanks and to please give me my keys but the sales manager could not accept that and kept on and kept on. Thankfully the salesman had enough respect for customers to quickly retrieve my keys so that I could leave. I have to admit...that was the worse car buying experience I have ever had and will certainly never step foot on that car lot again. ",1.0

10,"March 07, 2019","We loved our salesperson, Roseanna Gomez. We arrived late on a Saturday evening and she was patient and very accommodating and never rushed us or pressured us into buying a car.
she was very informative and knew a lot about the car and the most important part to me, service after the sell.

11,"March 05, 2019",I brought a nissan leaf in to check the chademo charger. This dealership charged me almost 600 dollars and never fixed the leaf. On a subsequent return for the charger repair I was charged for the work but the charger still does not work. Then when I return home a portable ev charger costing 800 dollars is missing.  The dealerships response. We won't work on your car any more. Lawyers pending. ,1.2
12,"January 21, 2019","Please be careful when buying a vehicle from Baytown Nissan. I found a car on car gurus and the price was $2500 more when I got there. They said it was because of the package they add. (Tint, oil changes, maintenance plan etc). After trying to work with them their sales associate and manager were very crass but because I fell in love with the car I still bought it. Upon returning for service the sales staff denied what I bought. They deceived me and sales staff was rude and denied everything. Please Avoid this place or make sure you get things in writing. Beware of the racked on “packages”. ",1.0
13,"December 16, 2018","I brought in my 2016 Nissan Maxima to be serviced due to tire damage.  I purchased the warranty so getting them replaced was not a problem due to Victoria being on her ""A game"".  However it didn't start that way.   I work over an hour away so I called before I left my job to find out what time they close to avoid any difficulties.   I arrived on Veteran's Day (me being a vereran myself) at 5:15pm (they close at 6) and a man in the service department turned me away informing me that they do not take vehicles so close to closing time.   I informed him that I work an hour away and called before I arrived.   Which meant nothing as he quickly turned me away.   I feel like that information should have been told to me when I called.   Victoria could see my frustration and suggested that I make an appointment to ensure I would get serviced with no problem.   I did just that.   When I arrived the next day,  Victoria got my car serviced in a jiffy.  No problems!! Good customer service is what brings me back to an establishment.   If it hadn't been for her, this rating would have been completely opposite.   Great job Victoria.   Thanks to Victoria,  I will be back!! ",5.0

Also after the purchase you will meet customer service representative Erin Gunn, another pleasant experience. We can hardly wait to purchase another vehicle.",5.0

17,"October 11, 2018","Just a friendly reminder to avoid this dealership.  I purchased a used vehicle from Baytown Nissan and within 800 miles the transmission completely failed.  No help and a complete lack of compassion toward finding an agreeable outcome.  I should mention I did speak with the manager and he told me to come in and buy a new vehicle from them and the incentives could possible cover the cost of the 
disabled car. Even emailed the General Manager and no response. Worst dealership management I have ever encountered.  ",1.8
18,"October 09, 2018","When I first arrived to the dealership, I was hopeful that I’d be able to drive off the lot with a new vehicle. The first salesman JOJO tried to convince me to purchase a clear lemon. Luckily my fiancé was with me. Then his sales manager Joseph was able to put me into a brand new 2018 Bussan Kicks. 

I was forever grateful and really happy. I signed the lease and was told I could put down $500. I did that and followed the procedure to do the phone interview with the bank. A week later I get a text stating my contract was canceled bc my job didn’t send back some paperwork but a new was done with the bank to get a cheaper down payment. They needed me to come in right away and sign the new contract. 
I had never heard of anything like that and after working hard all day, I went in to sign the new contract. When I got there they told me that I needed to pay another $530 bc the bank had taken that amount from them. I didn’t understand at all what they were talking about bc my first note wasn’t due for a few more weeks. That was the second sign. While there, JOJO tried to get me fill out the customer service review on him and asked me multiple times if I wanted to allow him to fill out the review on my behalf and I denied his request. I was beyond irritated, tired and ready to go home. I must admit he did have my car detailed and put gas in it for the inconvenience.

The latest news is a couple days ago I receive another email stating that they messed up and needed me to pay another $100 due to a miscalculation. Third strike in my book. The experience has quickly gone from great to horrible. Business and professionalism is extremely important. Playing with my money is never okay. That is a major mistake that shouldn’t happen from a professional establishment. I have never had to go through all of these issues with a dealership before after purchasing a car. I pay the down payment then future payments go to the bank. This is turning Into a nightmare! I don’t even know when the new due dates are because the bank hasn’t even emailed me the new date! Smh 

Since this situation, all of the nice customer service tones are out of the window with them. Beware when buying from them!",2.2

24,"March 12, 2018",I bought a 2017 Nissan Rogue Sport and the internet says 0% payment and $2000 cash back.  They low balled my trade in.  I got an email saying to pick up my license plates and also had an appointment to get help with features.  The receptionist didn't have the license plates because they only available on M-F 8-5 because of stolen plates.  The desk where the plates were stolen from should be manned if the doors are open.  Employee theft pops to mind if they don't trust employees with a key to the plates?  The receptionist also didn't bother to find the customer service person.  I called back later and asked to talk to my sales person.  The receptionist said he was in and then transferred to someone else.  That person transferred me to the sales person's cell phone because he really wasn't there.  No answer. I call dealer back and ask for a manager and get transferred to line that never got answered.  I called again and Ussabele couldn't be bothered.  I wrote a bad review of my experience online and mentioned the manager's name (Joey Bolton).  I get a phone call today from Joey whose angry about the review.  He threatened to call employer (third party intervention in employment is a crime) and his looking into my credit application is a violation of my privacy.  I called back and asked for Joey's boss and got Chris and told my story and Joey's threats.  By the fact he had absolutely nothing to say. I seriously doubt he was anything but a friend of Joey.  My analysis that led to the bad review was proven correct.,1.0

29,"November 15, 2017","The only employees I like is John and Tyler. They are very helpful in every way. But the service Sept management is very rude to customers. Angie sit behind desk putting makeup on in front of customers and lies state that they contact us via email on an address that didn't exist. Then onky conducts business late at night sending messages using her personal cell phone to text customers. And with a very rude attitude about it all. Then you have Tim you sat behind his desk with a red face and yelled at a customer with the office door wide open in front of other employees and customers walking close by.  He is very rude, talks very hateful towards customers and treat them very downgrading. We will never come back to this business again and we will not recommend no other family or friends to this dealership. These 2 employees need to be very disciplined and terminated from their job if they continue to act like that towards their customers in a place of business. These 2 employees make the customers very embarrassed and humiliated in public with no apologies or anything. ",1.0

35,"May 06, 2017","I found a vehicle I was very interested in online. Verified the inventory on the Baytown dealer website. I'm located about 1 hr away so I also called to confirm the vehicle was on the lot and was available...not pending sale or sold. Yes it was there and available, come over. The lady on the phone was great (Isabel). Was told to ask for her when I arrived. I checked in and asked for Isabel and after a brief wait, end up with William. He was the most pompous, unmotivated salesman I've ever been around. Bad feeling from minute one. Knew nothing about the vehicle, never bothered to get me information and after allowing me to test drive (without taking any of my personal information), we come back to the lot and I want to see if we can make a deal. William all the sudden has to go inside and check with a manager and comes back 3-5 minutes later and says ""I have bad news. This vehicle actually sold last night."" For real? I called and verified before driving over. Why even let me drive at all? Later that day...my husband (who was not with me when I went) contacts dealership to see if vehicle is available and was told YES! Ridiculous!

38,"January 16, 2017","My mother bought her car and has been having it serviced at this location for four years.  I simply drop it off and I'm transported back to my home until the car is ready for pick up.  Everyone is so kind and treats us like a VIP!  One night during the Christmas holidays, mother's battery went dead.  I called the service department and they were fixing to close.  Instead, the staff stayed there until the service man came out to check out the battery and then replace it.  I would say they treat us like family.  Who can beat that statement?

39,"December 28, 2016","Be mindful when you go here! If you are not an experienced Car Buyer, go somewhere else!!! Shady sales strategies like telling customers they don't discuss APR when asked! Then using some ""car dealers only imaginary credit scoring system"" to tell you you don't qualify for certain financing programs when the financing bank will use your credit score as you know it to finance you. I thought I knew enough to go to battle and should have taken the hint upfront that this was not a good place to purchase my truck.To top it off had a serious issue with the brand new vehicle and had to go through Nissan USA direct to attempt to resolve, purchase truck on Nov 15th, took it back 2 weeks later on the 30th of November, It is now December 28th and I am paying for a truck i'm not driving!!! what do they care? they got their money... I regret buying from here so learn from my mistake and find another option. I even regret buying a Nissan truck !!! Stay clear of this place!!! I made a $60,000 mistake. Can you afford that?
Vehicle had some minor issues with it, Camera on driver side mirror which turned out to be a busted mirror housing, fallen trimming between front and rear door and a one inch hole in the carpet only discovered because I purchased weather tech mats to protect it and found it when I removed the factory mats to install the weather tech, so took truck back to dealer November 30 2 weeks to the date of purchase. and they found serious amount of mold under carpet when they went to replace it. Had factory engineers come out to look at it already haven't figured out what twas wrong., created a case number, was called and emailed about a replacement but a month later you can understand my frustration there is not even inventory in the Houston, TX area to replace my truck based on what it had. I just ran out of patience and seems my only recourse is to take to social media with my pictures of the mold and the video I took of the trucks floor and maybe even local news to pay back Nissan for my inconvenience here. Replacing the truck takes care of the truck you sold me full of mold but it doesn't take care of the incredible inconvenience you guys have put me through. Mediator tells me If I return the truck I have to pay about 2 thousand bucks for use so I am forced to exchange! great tactic to keep me around!...
So the update on this situation, this dealer still has the truck I purchased on November 15th and took back to them on November 30th. the vehicle is still in their parking lot full of mold. because I posted this honest review of the bad experienced I have had so far with this sale, the general manager I'm told has decided to not help with the replacement process that Nissan has begun to try to make this right. Simply because of a review that showed I had a bad experience they are dropping me in the grease. I would have thought they would wanna get me to post an update stating that they did all they could even in a bad situation to make things right, instead they make it even worse, I still have no Titan, but I'm making payments. Trying to track down the owners of the dealer to see if they care enough to make this right this time, I will update later when status changes. 
Attempted to contact the owner who owns Baytown Nissan and Central Houston Nissan, he completely ignored my request for help. Which tells me this is the culture at both places. Avoid doing business here. Another dealer had to work with Nissan to replace my truck that Baytown Nissan crooks have had in their lot since November 30. Today is January 13th. ",1.0
40,"December 17, 2016","Applied for loan got call back saying approved for 25k choose ur car 0 down. Get there after 40 minute drive only to find they lied to me just to get me there. Told me I had to find something for 6k which they said was going to be hard to do only after telling me the car I wanted had been reck and was being saved for a customers friend according to sales rep JoJo !!!!!
They lie to you and tell you u are approved only to waste ur time. Will never visit this dealer or another stick to cash car buying. Ohhh I chose a used car for 16k and still could not answer me about why I need to find something for 6k no more as I was told my credit was ran as per application I put in on online website for the dealership they said come in choose car in the 25k and lower range before I came to the dealer. What a let down and a bunch of liers running your credit that is a hard credit inquiry that put negative remarks on your credit and drops your score every time it's ran. This is how I feel now about the dealer 🖕🏻",1.8

I'm seeking legal help now because when Scott finally called me last week he was rude, not concerned and he hung the phone up on me. He informed me they were busy and currently working on a transmission? Not sure why he needed to share this. This experience has been bad since day one, so please shop around before dealing with Baytown Nissan.",1.0
46,"January 18, 2016","Today I called Baytown Nissan to see if they were still open as they are the closest location to my home. Now normally, I purchase all my vehicles from David McDavid due to an awesome sales and service team however out of convenience I went here. The lady answered the phone (Anna I believe) was extremely nice and helpful telling me that they have a few sister properties if I'm not able to see the exact vehicle I wanted, getting it would be no problem. 

About forty-five minutes later I get to the dealership and meet up with Allen (the salesman had called while I was on the phone and told me to ask for him when I made it). I tell him EXACTLY the car I was hoping to buy and he leads me to the desk to fill out the inquiry sheet. First he appeared shocked when he assumed I rented and I told him I  ""own"" my home. From there he asks what my budget is and I tell him my expected payment amount. Hesitant I decided not to give my social security number at that moment because I'm familiar with the damage it does in a multi financial institute search. 

After a minute of small talk he then takes my keys to get my car appraised and stays gone for about 10 minutes. He comes back briefly and then leaves again. The next time he returns, he tells me they aren't able to give me what I owe on my vehicle (I actually told him this prior to the appraisal) and gave me an estimated monthly payment extremely higher than my budget. He then precedes to tell me they can get me into a year older car but he the note on the newer car would be too much. 

Not once did Allen ask if I was putting down a down payment, the features I enjoyed of the car, or any other basic sales questions!!! Allen- when a customer comes to you with a specific vehicle in mind you should find out what they enjoy about that vehicle but you should NEVER assume what they can or cannot afford. You judged me and unfortunately for Baytown Nissan I will never purchase a vehicle from this establishment.

47,"December 23, 2015",When I bought the car they didn't have a spare key because they lost it.  The guy that sold me the car and his manager NEVER return a phone call.  I had to call about 20-30 times to get it figured out.  The manager Yasieca sounded annoyed and the front desk girl is not the most polite.   Stay away from this dealership. Once you sign the papers they treat you like garbage. ,1.2
48,"August 06, 2015",I went to look at the 2016 maxima  was explained all the bells on this thing and test drove it.I would put this car as super for a 4 door and if in the market get one.My story is i was driving a vette and had to go with a 370Z.My salesman Tyler was well informed on his products and easy to talk to.I had to have a spoiler and pin stripe installed at the dealership and he set everything up and followed up to make sure it was set.I got their they took the car in and 1 and half hour later it was done.I think this customer service is hard to beat. I walked around talking to other employees and everyone was friendly and acted like they had a purpose of taking care of the customer.I like to visit a dealership and see how they do their business.I gave them 5 stars because not one thing was wrong with the deal.I will give credit to the sales manager and  GM Hector Lebron for their professionalism and what i saw the them doing.Yes the customer is watching everything that happens.I would have anyone i know give them a sale so great job!,5.0

I was very impressed by how helpful and caring everyone was. From receptionist to salesman, sales manager and finance department.

52,"January 23, 2015","Baytown Nissan has NO respect for women.  Let me start by saying that my Juke literally died in their service driveway.  After being insulted and lied to by the person at the service desk, my partner went and found the service manager who did his job and got us a loaner since my car had two major recalls.  The lady at the service desk who later took care of us was nice.  That being said, we decided that it was time to turn in the car for a new one.  I started looking online at their inventory and was promptly emailed and called to start the process of buying the new car.  I was already pre-approved by Nissan so we went back to Baytown to get a car.  The salesman was extremely childish; he said that I was upside down on my car, could not get  car unless I paid 8 thousand plus tax title and license for a total of almost 12 thousand dollars.  He then proceeded to tell us to go to either Dodge or Ford, that he could not and would not help.   We walked out of the dealership and contacted Clay Cooley Nissan from Austin (where I purchased my previous car)  Clay Cooley Nissan called me back within 10 minutes and asked me what color I wanted in my Nissan Altima LS.  We drove to Austin, turned in my Juke for 4,600.00 more than Baytown initially offered.  Baytown has NOT honored their pledge to give 500.00 Best Buy gift card if they cannot meet or beat the deal.  The sales manager said to bring the deal and show the paperwork which we did, they still refuse to stand by their pledge.  I hate that I even have to give them one star.   I will NEVER recommend or will NEVER take my Altima for my 24 months of free oil changes to them.

  What a difference one and a half (1 ½)  years and a new (unprofessional) management team makes. After the great experience I had after the purchase of my last vehicle at your dealership in 2011, my experience this time was a shock in dealing with a rude and very unprofessional group of upper management. I will be more than happy to sit down with you and explain what exactly your group of mis-managers did to make my experience at your dealership such an unpleasant one.
 
The most egregious act was while my wife and I were walking back toward our vehicle to leave, I looked over my shoulder to see all of your “Baytown Nissan” management employees in the corner office looking out at us laughing and smirking. I will share this experience with as many people as I can, so no one has to go through this type of ordeal to purchase a vehicle.
 
Thanks to the staff Baker Nissan, the day was saved. My wife and I purchased the new Murano we desired and left knowing not all Nissan dealerships are as unprofessional as the current team at BAYTOWN NISSAN.
 
Disappointed,
