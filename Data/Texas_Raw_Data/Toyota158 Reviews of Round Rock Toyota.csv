0,"April 24, 2020","Purchased a 2020 Tacoma TRD Pro yesterday. My homework served me well especially my choice of dealership. GM Tracy Gurnett and her team are obviously on a mission to change the worlds stereotypical perceptions of car dealerships. The sales person, Adam Fuller, treated my wife and I well. He was very professional, friendly and approachable. As a result, the transaction was very transparent. Advice to Buyers; Do the homework! Choose an honest dealership that values customers and choose a sales person you like.  You cannot go wrong with Tracy and her team! Most importantly, ALWAYS treat people the way you want to be treated.",5.0

3,"December 20, 2019",Came in for my 8am appointment and had a short wait for a technician to acknowledge me. Then had the annual state safety inspection which was completed very fast. It was a pleasant experience.,5.0
4,"December 20, 2019","Customer service was excellent.  Repair time fast.  Sally who took care of me was very efficient, friendly, and went out of her way to accommodate me.  Hatchback on my  2013 Rav 4 
would not open.  Took in at 2 pm and a quick inspection was made to determine that a part needed to be ordered for the latch.  Shuttle was provided and I was told part would be in the next day.  At 8:30 the next morning Sally notified me my car was ready for pickup.  Bill for parts and labor was over $800.00 which I thought was extremely high.  Car was out of warranty, but only has 20,000 miles on it.  I am a senior citizen who takes excellent care of her car.  This is my 4th Toyota after being a Honda customer for a few years.  Just a bit disappointed in Toyota quality since I have never had any maintenance repair cost on other Toyota cars other than battery replacement.  Hopefully the quality hasn‚Äôt gone down and this was just a fluke.
I recently moved here from Corpus Christi Tx. and a few of the car dealerships (not Toyota) now offer pickup and delivery of your vehicle for maintenance.  This would really be a big plus for seniors like myself.",4.0

8,"December 16, 2019","I have been a loyal customer of the Round Rock Toyota Service Department for over 4 years. 
The service advisors have been honest and fair in their assessment of problems. Recently I took my 2005 Tacoma for a 150,000 maintenance. The truck runs like new thanks in part to the service department's maintenance. 

My service advisor, Sally, gave me her honest opinion on the 51 month old battery which was slowly degrading. I have been stranded twice with a failed battery, average age 4 yrs. due to this Texas heat, and thought it time to do preventive maintenance. 

I will return to Round Rock Toyota, the only facility that works on the truck. ",5.0

33,"October 24, 2019","I purchased an, admittedly, used Jeep here and it has made a squealing/screeching noise since the day I got it. It takes roughly 15-20 minutes of driving or idling for it to begin so of course I didn‚Äôt know about it until after I‚Äôd already bought it (test drives are like 15 minutes max?). I contacted the dealership immediately and they asked me to bring it back for them to look at - so I did. They said they couldn‚Äôt replicate the noise despite me having heard it while pulling into the dealership and also immediately after returning home. They asked for a video of the noise so I sent them multiple. They asked me to bring it back again - so I did - and they said they replaced the idler pulley. Excited that it was finally fixed - I drove it home and the noise remained. I played phone and text tag with the dealership for weeks - literally. Finally the sales manager (Bob Larimore) contacted me and I missed his call (I work obviously), so over two weeks I called him 4 times and left 3 messages and he never called me back. Finally I got in contact with a different manager (Arik Sichevoi) who had me bring it in, (3rd time) and they kept it for a few days, told me they ‚Äúsent it to Jeep‚Äù and that Jeep said ‚Äúall was well.‚Äù All is not well. I contacted them AGAIN and they told me they ‚Äúwere not sure what else they could do for me.‚Äù...fix it? It continues to make the noise and I haven‚Äôt gotten to enjoy having a new vehicle since getting it because I am just worried about paying to fix it now. I was sent an email by Carfax to review the service provided by the dealership, so I did, and ANOTHER manager (Tracy Gurnett)  responded asking me to send my contact info. I did. I‚Äôve emailed her three times in three weeks. No response. Pretty disappointing and disgusted with how they have handled the situation. Now I have a new (used) car that makes an unbearable noise when I drive it so my new car experience has been lackluster. I‚Äôve waited months to make this review, hoping they would rectify the situation but evidently they aren‚Äôt going to. Sucks.",1.0
34,"May 09, 2019",I got scammed when I purchased a 2014 Honda civic si from this place. You would think a brand dealership would get thir cars inspected and fixed before selling it to a customer. WRONG not in round rock toyota they are just trying to do a quick flip on cars that people trade in. I got sold a wrecked car that just had the bumper and plastics replaced to hide what was damaged the ac condenser is all twisted up. Their service center tried to put the blame on me but all the plastic pieces are intact. Please don't do business with them.,1.0
35,"February 23, 2019","Tremendous experience from the salesperson all the way up to the GM.

39,"July 14, 2017"," I truly wish I could find something positive about my latest interactions here.  My prius had the ""major hybrid malfunction "" light come on along with some shaking of the car.  I took it in and my advisor explained to me that they couldn't see anything wrong, but it probably was low on gas.  He verified this by shining a flashlight in the tank and then saying that it definitely looked lower than the gauge was reading and said he could replace the gauge for a hefty cost.  I 100% disagreed and unfortunately, this advisor resorted to mansplaining and talking over me.  He did offer to reduce the $130 diagnostic fee to $100 and said if it comes on again to come back in for no diagnostic fee.  6 days later, it's on again, and the car is shaking.  Initially I had to argue about getting it checked free of charge.  They came back and said it was low on oil and gave me a $1400 list with suggested standard maintenance items.  When I asked specifically about items on the list, several were listed based not on showing telltale signs of a need, but based on them having no record of the car having it done with them.  Huh????  Anyway, once again I argued the problem had nothing to do with oil and he talked over me and let me know he was doing me a favor by not charging me the diagnostic fee and he wouldn't do it again.  Fast forward one week later and the same light comes on and within a matter of minutes the car is dead in the middle of a busy road.  I took it elsewhere where they heard me, treated me with respect, identified the problem and fixed it so the car no longer shakes and the light no longer comes on.  I called Toyota and left 2 messages for a supervisor to call me back.  They never did.",1.0
40,"April 14, 2017","Debbie standiford led us through the sales experience with absolutely no pressure whatsoever.  She explained everything about the car I was interested in and after we purchased it, she went though everything about the car.  Not only that, but she followed through by emailing after a couple of weeks to see if we had any questions. 
The person who did the financial part of our purchase was also very low, as in no, pressure.  He explained all the options available and answered our questions professionally. 
 I highly recommend Debbie and Round Rock Toyota. ",5.0
41,"April 10, 2017","Wow! I HIGHLY recommend this dealership to anyone needing to get their Toyota serviced!!!!

I am from out-of-state and keeping my '06 Highlander Hybrid in great condition is really important to me with my family being across the country. I found this dealership from the recommendation of a friend and I am SO glad. 

From the moment you arrive to the moment the repair is complete, the staff is incredibly helpful. They are professional, courteous, and very honest about the process and cost of what needs to be done. The waiting area is extremely comfortable and welcoming with fresh cookies baked throughout the day. Typically, each person I interact with puts me in a better mood than when I arrived.

Just to discuss a personal situation, I recently brought my Highlander in for service after an error message of the ""Hybrid System."" To my surprise, the entire hybrid battery failed and needed to be replaced. This repair was quoted at nearly $7,000. As a current medical student, that cost was nearly impossible to stomach. However, it was this moment that I was astonished by dealership's incredible commitment to their customers!

My service technician, Kimo, did a PHENOMENAL job. He explained every detail of the repair and what needed to be done. As I explained my financial situation, he stepped in. He helped coordinate two different avenues that I could call and request financial assistance from Toyota. To my complete surprise, corporate Toyota contributed $2,500 to the repair and the Round Rock Toyota also contributed approx. $1,000!! This was solely out of customer appreciation, because my family only buys Toyota's and we get them serviced solely at dealership. 

Jimmy Wilson, the Service Manager, is also wonderful!! He made the decision for the dealership to contribute to the repair and was extremely helpful in explaining to both my father and I every detail of what was going on with the car.

Overall, I could not recommend this dealership more!! They care that you have a positive experience and do the work exceptionally well! I currently live about 30 min from the dealership and if I move further south, I will certainly continue to drive as far out of the way as necessary to continue using this dealership!

THANK YOU to Kimo and Jimmy Wilson for a terrific experience! ",5.0
42,"February 02, 2017","I ended up buying my 2017 Toyota Yaris iA at Charles Maund because Charles Maund makes profit by selling volume.  It became clear after I made 2 offers to Round Rock Toyota that they want to get rich off of each sale.  I got my Yaris at Charles Maund for less than the ""True Car"" Great Price and that included a very nice window tint and 0.0% financing for 72 months.  Try an offer like that at Round Rock and you will see the light!  Also, after I purchased at Charles Maund I contacted the sales person Randall Sanchez at Round Rock just to let him know I had made the decision to go with Charles Maund and to tell him I didn't think it was his fault that Round Rock lost the sale.  Before this Randall had been very nice to me but after I told him that he got nasty with me and assured me it was him who refused my offer and then told me he sells 20 cars a month and didn't need my business.....after I had told Randall I didn't think it was his fault,...Wow!  I would recommend that you test drive at Round Rock but you'd be crazy not give a volume sales dealership like Charles Maund an opportunity to beat the Round Rock price. Round Rock is NOT a volume sales dealership.",1.0
43,"July 24, 2016","I recently bought a used car from Round Rock Toyota and was very pleased with the overall experience.  I was contacted by Bobby Callender and I would absolutely recommend him to anyone.  Bobby was super helpful, he even came in on his day off to help with everything.  When I asked for an out the door price they showed everything on paper, no hidden fees, or charges, and when I went back to the finance guy, nothing changed, same price, no haggling at all.  
Overall, it was a great experience, and I am happy with my new car.

44,"June 01, 2016","Purchased my first Toyota yesterday at Round Rock Toyota thanks to the salesman, Randall Sanchez. I will admit when he first approached I was apprehensive because of his youthful appearance. But his professionalism and knowledge quickly changed my opinion.  Not only was he friendly and personable, he was able to answer all questions I had.  He went out of his way to assist with my elderly mother and to aptly sell his company product and service without be a pushy salesman.  He made me feel confident in my decision and trusting in Toyota as a whole. So kudos to Randall who was an awesome representative of the company.",5.0
45,"March 10, 2016",I have purchased 3 vehicles from Round Rock Toyota. I also have my vehicles serviced there. Each time I have made a purchase I dealt with Salesperson Yohannes Samuel.

46,"August 24, 2015","Purchased a 2015 used Toyota Corolla with ~16,000 miles on odometer August 2015.  This is the first time I have ever felt compelled to write a review after purchasing a vehicle. My salesperson at Round Rock Toyota Scion was Byron West. He listened carefully to my needs and concerns. I looked at new and used Toyota Corollas. He helped me compare finance rates on new vs. used cars and introduced me to Oz Ali in the finance department. We negotiated an awesome deal on a Certified used 2015 Toyota Corolla. This has been the best experience I've ever had at a car dealership, and I'm 55 years old! Byron and Oz were both very knowledgeable, patient, friendly and professional. I would recommend these 2 gentlemen to anyone looking for a new or used vehicle. ",5.0
47,"April 29, 2015","When I was looking for a Tacoma back in 2014, nobody here was willing to look beyond the dealership property.  They had one that was 3/5 of the way to what I wanted, and that's as close as anyone ever got here.  They even offered to make my first 3 payments, but I didn't want a truck that I didn't want.

So, I bought my Tacoma elsewhere.

Decided to make and appointment and bring it here for the ToyotaCare services.  First time, I was assigned service advisor Mike Noack.  Just needed my 10k service (basically oil change and tire rotation), so I waited on it.  Everything when as well as I'd expect.  Nice waiting area, coffee, wifi so I could work, and the indoor drive-up area was a nice touch.  Service took about an hour and 45, not bad.

First service was good enough, so I decided to bring it back for my 15k maintenance.  This trip was completely different.  Drove into the bay, got out and waited...and waited...and walked around my truck to draw attention to myself...and waited.  After about 5-10 minutes of being looked at and past, walked by, and overall ignored I walked up to a young man standing by a podium.  I asked him if anyone could come take my truck in as I had an appointment, he looked up from his phone and told me that someone would be out and to go stand by my truck.  Fine.  Waiting....

Mike shows up, asks me what I need done, and I tell him my 15k and that there was a TSB that I thought my truck was showing symptoms of.  For the next 20 minutes, Mike tried to explain to me all the ways in which the symptoms I was seeing were user error, or somehow caused by me.  The TSB, by the way, is T-SB-0044-14 for the 4.0L engine pinging.  I understand going over some causes of the symptoms, but it would be more beneficial to cut that short and see if you can reproduce the issue rather than telling me not to go to Valero and that Shell and Exxon are better.  Base unleaded from any of the stations in Austin are the same 87 octane.

Finally he takes the truck back and I go to the waiting room.  An hour and a half go by and a rep from the waiting area approaches to ask if they've come out to talk to me about my vehicle yet.  ""No.""  So they offered to go check.  They returned to tell me that they just took my truck back.  Really?  After another round of this, I ask to speak to Mike.  They try to find him and eventually come back to tell me that he told them to tell me that he'd be out to talk to me.  Finally he comes to speak to me, tells me that they were able to reproduce my engine pinging issue, which is no surprise since Toyota has acknowledged it, so they'd be starting the ECU reflash and oil change.  Starting?  It's been two and a half hours now.

When he returns with my paperwork, he shows me the inspection checklist and tells me that my engine air filter is in the ""yellow"", meaning it would need to be changed during my next visit.  Clearly nobody bothered to actually LOOK at the engine air filter because I had changed it the day before.  It was WHITE.  Whatever, I just want out by this time.  Get in the truck, nobody reset the maintenance light.  Small issue, but really how long have you had the truck that you couldn't reset the light?  Naturally, I'm questioning whether or not any maintenance was done to the truck, so I check the oil dipstick.  At least they changed the oil.

After I get home, I read the TSB from Toyota again, there's supposed to be a sticker with the version of the ECU software placed under my hood after the service was done.  I have no sticker, nor do I want to go back and even try to get one from them at this point.

Ok, so 2 stars...the waiting room was nice (clean, had coffee and WIFI to work from), and they changed my oil and reflashed my ECU...which is all I needed them to do.

48,"November 18, 2014",They try to screw you over every chance they get. Under value trades and over value used vehicles.  I will never try to do business there again and discourage anyone who is thinking about going there. They tried to get me to put $9000 down on a $9300 truck. They wouldn't even tell me my trade in value.  Then tried to sell me a hatchback scion when I was looking for a cheap truck.,1.0
49,"August 21, 2014","Buying a car can be stressful, at least for me. I have to say that this was the most pleasurable experience I have ever had. I was treated well from the moment I walked onto the lot. Chris Splendoria went out of his way to find me the ideal car. When the car I was interested in was sold before I returned Chris had already started looking for something else as an alternative, which he found and I could not be more thrilled about my new car.

I am grateful for the fast and considerate services. Everyone in the dealership was wonderful and very helpful. I did not leave feeling as I was lacking any knowledge on my Toyota.

I would definitely recommend Round Rock Toyota to my friends and family and you can bet your bottom dollar that I will be going back in the future.

50,"February 22, 2014",Made an appointment to buy a car we had looked at. Someone else finished up their purchase of the car while we waited.  Lack of communication between sales people caused us to waste time and a trip for a car that they were already doing paperwork for someone else.,3.4
51,"December 18, 2012","Sales staff are very professional and will work to close a fair deal. Ryan Scheffer, the sales rep, is a professionl. Let me explain.  He knows as much about the competitive automobiles as he does about his products, Toyota, Honda, & Hyundai. 
My Family and I now have bought three new Toyota Vehicles from them for that reason. One had an issue with the drivetrain on the second day from drive off. Service management (Bob Lang and Jimmy Wilson) did all they could considering Toyota has strict guidelines in place to solve certain issues. They were professional and compassionate though and involved the General Manager, Caron Corzine, so that the issue would not drag out over more time for us. When Toyota corporate policy's may have delayed a solution, the sales and dealer management, Ryan & Caron, hits one out of the ball park and the vehicle issue is resolved within the week.  MAJOR APPLAUSE.  They got all corporate obstacles out of the way of service, let their master lead tech, Paul A. get involved and the magic of ""great Service"" happened. To everyone in central Texas ... this is how a good dealer and great people are supposed to be. Having retired from professional sales, I can tell it like it is. The service AFTER the sales is what you are really buying. If you want solid vehicles and that SERVICE where and when it is needed, you won't go wrong with these folks.",4.6
52,"September 20, 2012","We had an appointment with Bruce to look at some new Tacoma pickup trucks. After waiting in their nice lobby for about 10 minutes the sales manager Tim came up to us, apologized that Bruce had gotten tied up with another customer and asked if Jose could help us. That was fine by me so I told Jose what we were looking for, he took us out to a string of vehicles, passing some explaining what it was about them that wasn't what we were looking for. We got to one that he showed us with just what I had described and we took it for a spin. 

When we returned I asked if I could test one that was in the front of the dealership that I had my eye on when we arrived. They had to move a few cars to get it out and we took off in that. He answered a few &quot;test&quot; questions to see how honest I felt he was and he passed all of them so we sat down to negotiate. I don't go into that saying it's my way or the highway, I know they like to dicker so I have a price in mind, low ball them, they highball me and we go back and forth until I am happy with it. This was a pretty painless process from start when I walked in, through the paperwork with Jason to finish when Bruce ran me through the niceties of the vehicle and I drove out with my new truck.

The best compliment I could pay to a dealership is to say that the next time we need a car this will be our first stop. By far the easiest experience I've had buying a car.",5.0
53,"February 19, 2012",Kenneth was very friendly and there was no pressure to buy. He answered just about every question and always asked if I had questions. I'm looking forward to having a long relationship with the dealership since I plan to keep my Pilot for a long time.,4.6
54,"January 02, 2012","Shopping at Round Rock Toyota was a very low stress and pleasant experience!  My great salesman, Tim Beliakov did not mind spending time with us looking at new cars and assisting us with comparable used cars.  The dealer was honest and genuine.  He test drove 4 different cars with us before I decided which one I liked best.  Tim went the extra mile!!!  I recommend Tim to all my friends and family now and I will never buy a car from anyone else.  I am a very happy customer!",5.0

56,"November 19, 2011","We had visited several Toyota dealers and were not happy with their high pressure sales tatics. We then decided to try Round Rock Toyota, at first we walked onto the carlot, passed several sales staff with no response from any of them, we walked further towards the Tundra and Tacoma area and Deborah saw us and approached us immediately, both her friendliness, postive attitude and professional acumen impressed both my wife and I, answering all questions concerning performance, options and trailering packages.

61,"November 17, 2011","My husband and I initially went in to take a look at a new Toyota in the summer of 2011.  Upon our visit we encountered Tim Beliakov.  We explained that we were unsure if we were ready to purchase just yet and only wanted to look around. He showed us the two vehicles we were interested in, giving a thorough and detailed description of each.  We thanked him for his time and told him that we would call if we decided to purchase.  We decided not to purchase at that time and he respected our decision and did not hound or harass us as some other salespeople had in the past.  
  Fast forward to October, we finally decided that now was the time purchase.  I called the dealership and personally asked for Tim. He took my call, remembered our initial visit and was happy to assist me again.  I told him what vehicle I wanted and the required specifications.  He found the right vehicle and addressed my concerns with pricing.  He was very polite, kind and courteous.  He was not overbearing or pushy.  Tim later follwed up with courtesy phone calls to make sure things were going well with the vehicle and offered assistance with set-up and operation of the bluetooth and homelink features.  I am pleased with my purchase and the service I received from Tim.  If I buy another Toyota I will definitely call Tim again and I would recommend him to friends and family without hestitation.",4.8

Dan made sure the car was detailed before we left the dealership and went over every detail of the features before we took our car home.  I have NEVER felt so supported or taken care of as I did with Dan and it felt as if we had just bought the most expensive car on his lot (which we did not).  We were treated with respect and courtesy by every member of the team at this dealership.

We were looking to trade in a specialty vehicle that the dealership wanted to give us an insignificant amount for.  When this was brought up with Mohammed, in addition to financing through Toyota, he told us no one else would give us a better price, that he had no influence over the trade in amount, and that we should stick with the financing through our bank because Toyota could not finance us.  He also failed to reply to communication from my wife, directing communication only to me.  Well well... we went to Toyota of Killeen, where we worked with Jim Bounds.  Not only did they offer us $2000 more for our trade, they also cut the interest rate we were planning on with our bank by 2/3 through Toyota financing.  Suddenly Mohammed has begun emailing us again with the great deals he can offer us after everything he told us previously.  Now, if Mohammed really has no influence over trade in amounts, communication, or financing, I wonder what he could possibly offer us now and what the real difference between dealerships could be.

When I went to Round Rock Mohammed showed me around the Avalon, I took a drive and said I would be in touch. It was not a problem and I did not get harassed.

When I came in I dealt with Kimo who was friendly and great to work with.  I'll send people to Debbie and Kimo in the future.

I do think that 6 hours to buy a car for cash seems a bit long.  However, the car needed to be prepped and the car had to be programmed for an extra key.  I was also trading in my used '05 Prius.  I got a reasonable trade for it as well.

Last week on Thursday, February 17, 2011, like in all occasions, my wife was at your service department receiving a standard oil change on our 1997 Toyota Avalon when she began shopping your latest arrivals of the 2011 Toyota Avalon.

Mohammed Merchant wandered upon my wife and recognized her from the last sale and purchase of our 1997 Toyota Avalon. Like years past, Mr. Merchant was very consistent with his kindness and was very attentive to her inquiries of the new models. Mr. Merchant provided knowledgeable details of all its features and was willing to drive us to another lot on more than one occasion to show the various available colors offered in the 2011 Toyota Avalon. In concert with his professional demeanor, Mr. Merchant ultimately utilized his quick computer comprehension to offer a trade in value of our 1997 Toyota Avalon and furnished exact monthly payments for a new car and ultimately led us to the purchase our 5th vehicle from Round Rock Toyota, the 2011 Avalon.

Please extend our sincere gratitude and appreciation to Mr. Merchant for his willingness to go beyond the true definition of GREAT customer service. Mr. Merchant DOES NOT portray the reputation of a typical salesman. Mr. Merchant makes available and negotiates reasonable agreements towards a trade in and purchase of a new car. He is truly an asset to your sales staff and is a high-quality representation of Round Rock Toyota. 

Sincerely,

When I asked Charles about one of those options, he told me that no one gets that option and recommended that I didn't need it. While I had believed him before that point in time, I knew then that this was one of the most honest & trustworthy salesmen that I had spoken too during my car buying experience.

My experience finding a car was pretty volatile, with some people that flat out lied to me (and it was pretty blatant), to friendly people like Charles and the staff at Round Rock Toyota that was on the opposite side of the spectrum. I would recommend Round Rock Toyota to anyone buying a Toyota, and specifically, Charles Wieters. He will work with you on a price and won't give you the run-around.  ",5.0

He and the Round Rock Toyota team were very patient and helpful and had me approved, traded-in and signed in just a few hours.

111,"July 28, 2010","Round Rock Toyota has definitely set the bar when it comes to the auto industry.  I was blown away by the level of professionalism of every single staff member I came into contact with, from the front desk assistant to the members of the sales team, to the finance team.  As a first-time buyer, this facility had everything that was important to me: everyone was friendly and approachable, the building was very clean, and no one pressured me at all.

I was particularly impressed with my sales agent, Kimo Ah Yo.  From the first time I met him I could tell he was different from all the other sales agents I have ever dealt with before.  His smile is genuine.  He listens to what you are saying, what your needs are, and what your budget is.  He genuinely cares.  The one thing that stuck out in my mind that Kimo mentioned was that no matter what, he wanted his customers to be in the best car for them.   And I have to say, Kimo did exactly that for me.  He went above and beyond the call of duty.  

I couldn‚Äôt believe this, but Kimo remembered something I mentioned briefly to him in passing.  He remembered I said that I used to have a white 1992 Corolla years ago.  When it came time to pick out my new Corolla with him, I told him the color didn‚Äôt really matter to me.  Kimo chose white and I was so happy!  It was perfect and it reminded me of my old Corolla and all the fond memories I had.  I also mentioned in passing that my father has been ill, and every time I‚Äôve talked to Kimo he has asked me how my father is doing.  This type of genuine care and concern is very rare and these are the qualities that will keep me coming back to Round Rock Toyota.  

I have already recommended Kimo and Round Rock Toyota to two friends, and that number will only continue to grow.  I am so happy with my experience and the way I have been treated at Round Rock Toyota.  I have to admit, I was nervous about being a first-time buyer.  I was nervous that I would be taken advantage of and walked all over and that no one would explain things to me.  But that was far from the case.  Kimo and also the finance manager I dealt with, Jeff Dohrman, treated me with the upmost professionalism, courtesy, and respect at all times.  Everything was explained to me in detail.  All of my questions were answered and I felt very comfortable throughout the entire process.  It was painless!  It was nothing at all like I had imagined.  I am very appreciative to Kimo for helping me purchase my new Corolla.  I didn‚Äôt think I would be able to have a new car right now, but thanks to him I do.",5.0

I had contacted several different dealerships and for the most part as soon as I walked off the lot because they didn't have what I wanted in stock and wouldn't compromise or work with me at all to get the pmt where I was comfortable that was it!!

He didn't get white-knuckled when we went for the demo drive but he did have a great sense of humor about it.  Ryan was polite and very respectful of my needs and I couldn't have ask for anyone better.  Marty worked with me on the pricing and was very enjoyable to work with as well.  He worked hard to get the price right for me to be able to afford the RAV4 that I just love.  And Jeff was the finance closer, who was also very pleasant to work with.  My previous car was also a Toyota which I bought from a dealership in central Austin and was the worst experience I have ever had.  The finance guy there was unbelievably rude and arrogant, so I was dreading the finance part of buying my RAV4. Jeff was completely the opposite and made the finance portion a very pleasant and comfortable experience.  These guys are all amazing!!

Mohammed Merchant, my sales counselor from the previous year who sold me a 2009 Corolla, recognized me and offered to get me a newer 2010 model.  As I had driven only 10,000 miles I did not think it was necessary, but with 0% financing and a transfer of the existing loan amount to a newer car, I was able to save on future interest charges and immediately apply a high trade-in value.

Therefore I agreed and the process was very quick and easy without any complicated hassles.  I like it when veteran sales representatives like Mr. Merchant can cut to the chase and make a viable offer without having to run back and forth to a manager for approval.

I was told I may get a call before then if they could fit me in before then. I got a call at the end of June and it sounded like I could get in earlier. With the 4th of July holiday I did not get back to Toyota until the following Monday. Now I've been moved from August to September. The only reason we were given is that ""Gee, Toyota didn't call both our numbers so they didn't reach someone"".
