0,"December 31, 2019","I bought a “certified used” truck from this dealership in November. When I test drove the truck the check engine light was on and they fixed that. I ended up buying the truck because it seemed like a small thing. When I went to pick this truck up and started driving it down the road the low coolant indicator came on. Later, after being told that squealing was normal on larger trucks, I pulled the rear wheels off and the brakes were non existent and it was steel to rotor. There’s a safety hazard and 1,000.00. The dealership gave me a few oil change vouchers as a “I’m sorry”. About two weeks after that, I had it parked on a hill and noticed white substance coming out of the side wall of the front tire. I took it to discount tire to check and they said that it was filled with a industrial fix a flat and that the inside wall was so damaged that it could have blown at any time. To make it even worse the right wheel had a large dent in it. And the cherry on top... the tires on the truck I was sold from this dealership were not suppose to be on the rims. Wrong size.  Buyer beware, these guys don’t check anything and piece mail a vehicle to sell you at top dollar. ",1.0
1,"September 13, 2019",If you’re in the market for a new car Zeek is your guy!! He got my husband out of his old ride and into his dream Jeep and did it under budget! Was definitely worth the drive out there! We’ve already decided where we’ll be getting my next car from. Can’t recommend Zeek at South County of Sealy enough!! ,5.0
2,"August 26, 2019",We have purchased two vehicles from South County now - they did us right on both deals and were easy to work with - Fair prices with excellent service.  We also get our vehicles serviced there and have had no issues at all.  So glad they are in Sealy to serve this community!!,5.0
