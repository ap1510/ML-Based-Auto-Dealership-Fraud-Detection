0,"November 03, 2018","I had an awesome experience at this dealership. They worked with me,the accommodations were amazing. I work strange hours and it’s really hard to do business. Ronnie Keener stayed at the dealership until everything was final. They searched their inventory and prices and offered me exactly what I wanted, I can’t imagine buying a car anyplace else!! Thanks classic i’m grateful that I was referred there!",5.0

7,"September 02, 2017","I was treated so well at this dealership, that my husband took his vehicle in for service with next two days! I was greeted with a smile by my client manager Jim Johnson, with whom I had previously spoken by phone, discussed what service my vehicle required. He called me later when the technician found an additional problem to discuss it before moving forward with repairs. Jim is the GREATEST!!!! I also appreciated getting a clean, vacuumed vehicle back. No one I have been to before does that!!! What a great courtesy!! Jim answered all of my questions and went over the invoice with me so I would know what was repaired and why. I had a great experience!",4.6
