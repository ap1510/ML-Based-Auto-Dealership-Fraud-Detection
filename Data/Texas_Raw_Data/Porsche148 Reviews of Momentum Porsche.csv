Shawn and Philip did a great job and one sales man (I don‚Äôt know his name in the front desk)describes about the new cayenne coupe! He answered my questions about the new 911. üëç,4.0

7,"February 22, 2020","Terrible experience with the used car manager, David Yi. My husband and I flew all the way from Florida to buy a pre-owned 911 only to realize the car had been heavily tracked in its lifetime, and despite this, Yi stated the asking price of the car was not negotiable touting Momentum is a ‚Äúsonic dealership.‚Äù Not only does their website have zero disclosure that the price is nonnegotiable, but he was cocky, condescending, and conveyed zero desire to get a sale done, even when negotiating over 3% of a reduction in price on a high end luxury used vehicle. I was trying to get their collaboration to offset our travel expenses and the transportation cost of the car, in response to which we were offered a mug or a hat and told by Yi that when you buy a house you don‚Äôt negotiate the price. I‚Äôm not sure what planet he lives on, but it‚Äôs not one where he should be in a management role where the mandate is to sell cars and make customers happy. We walked over his unwilling to flex $500 on the price of the car despite me being prepared to purchase it there and then. Worst car buying experience of my life and my husband and I have owned over 20 cars between us. ",1.0

9,"February 14, 2020",I bought my 2019 Porsche Macan from Momentum Porsche in Houston. Right from day one when I called to the day of delivery - I was helped by Trae Smullen in the best possible way. We live in Dallas so buying a car remotely is challenging but Trae and Mementum made the purchase very smooth. We just picked up our 2019 Macan yesterday and enjoying it to the maximum !! Thanks Trae and Momentum Porsche.,5.0

20,"May 09, 2017","Damaged a tire, had the vehicle towed to dealer. Replaced both rear tires (which were in stock-couldn't find anywhere else!), and worked in an overdue oil change while I waited. I've used them before and if I could have scheduled ahead of time, they would have had a loaner available. ",5.0
21,"May 14, 2016","Just purchased my first Porsche and it was an excellent experience.  My sales specialist Ben Dubuc was outstanding.  My Porsche was on order and he kept me informed the entire way.  He was extra patient with me when I changed my build 4 times (don't know if I could have been that patient) and helped me with all of my questions.  His level of service and professionalism was the best and greatly appreciated.  

Janette Garcia assisted me in the finance department and she gets full marks as well.  She took time to explain all the options available to me and helped me make some important decisions.  She was as excited about my new purchase as I was.  Janette did a stellar job!",5.0

24,"November 27, 2015","First time buying a Porsche, and in fact first time ordering a car. My wife fell in love with the Macan and had to have one. The process start to finish was phenomenal! Great salesperson in Ben... Zero pressure initial exploration experience... Good guidance in selecting the right features for her car... Easy online tracking as the car was being transported from Germany... Delivery date met initial expectations... Financing easy and good terms... And a fun pick up experience. Net/net, my wife is very excited, and I'm pleased that the process didn't feel tough, burdensome, or slimy as car purchases can often feel. Highly recommend Momentum Porsche in Houston!",4.8
25,"November 08, 2015","Ben was great to work with. Easiest car purchasing experience I have ever had. I got the car I loved, with no pressure. Highly recommend. ",4.8
26,"June 16, 2015","I bought a pre-owned Cayenne which apparently has been through the quality control for resell. One week after, water pumped failed, $800 repair. Windshield viper was ripped off ( you would expect it to have been changed before listing for re sale as a quality controlled vehicle). A grounding noise was bothering me in turns and took it to the service department twice and they couldn't figure it out. on the third attempt, they did an extensive diagnostic for a week and they said transmission kit needs to be changed, $6800 for part and $700 for labor. Car was in their shop for nearly one month to have the part ordered and repaired. The loaner was only for 5 days so I didnt even bother to ask for one and I drove my other car. Loaner would have been Nissan Ultima or Chevy impala by the way not anything fancy if you would think you would expect in return for a Porsche. And I paid for the highest end warranty package. Don't bother with Cayenne. Its not a great SUV. Just a name brand, no comfort and no reliability. Pay the same price for a Land Cruiser. I rather an X5 over Cayenne! You need to bend over to get in. Not very good if you have back problem. Also randomly different alarms come on. Light intensity of the lights fluctuates when the car is on idle. So much aggravation with owning one. I am planning to trade mine in with a Land Cruiser or an X5!",3.2
27,"May 11, 2015","Isaac provided excellent service before, during and after my new car purchase.  He was prompt and great at providing all the details of my new car purchase.  Highly recommended!",5.0
28,"April 28, 2015","I bought my Porsche without ever driving it or seeing it.  All over text message with Jen Sullivan.  She is so knowledgeable and professional and is the very best.  She is truly the best asset Momentum Porsche has.  Highly recommend her, the dealership and the Porsche Cayenne.",5.0
29,"April 27, 2015","Isaac was very helpful in making me feel comfortable buying my car over the internet. He went beyond the call of duty by checking and re-checking the car for me.  He would take more photos and fixed a scratch, detailed the car and helped have it delivered to my front door.  Also, always answered my calls when he had to be tired of me.   Thanks again for a great experience in car buying!",5.0
30,"April 24, 2015","Isaac was very helpful both over email and when I came to see the car from out of town.  Represented the car well, very knowledgeable about the brand and helped make the experience stress free.  I purchased a used vehicle, and they went above a beyond to clean up marks and make it look great.  I would buy from them again.  ",4.8
31,"April 19, 2015",Chase Baxter and Henry Yeung are both exceptional service representatives. I have dealt with them both on several occasions and they treat me and my 2000 Boxster like I owned the most expensive car they service. The are both a terrific face for the dealership and I know management must be thrilled to have them.   ,4.6
32,"April 16, 2015",Henry Yeung was diligent and responsive and handled all of my needs.  Car was ready when I arrived and he is the best.  I will definitely request him again!,5.0
33,"April 15, 2015",I just purchased a car from Isaac at Momentum Porsche and walked away an extremely happy client. The service was impeccable and Isaac made sure that every interaction went smoothly and was concise and meet my needs and expectations. I could not have asked for better experience. They have earned my loyalty and I would encourage you to visit them if you are looking to buy a Porsche. ,5.0
34,"April 04, 2015","Pleasant experience from beginning to end. Isaac Knew what car I was looking for because of an earlier call and quickly retrieved the vehicle for a test drive. Everything that we asked for was taken care of, and Isaac thoroughly went over all car features with my wife. She is super happy!!",5.0
35,"April 03, 2015","All I can say is that I had an excellent experience at Momentum Porsche and it was due to the personnel. My Sales Representative was Issac Tapias and he was a very knoweledgable and helpful agent. There was no pressure or pretense and he answered all my questions without hesitation and took every request I had seriously. When I went to pick up the car the left headlight had a scracth in it and without hesitation the Service Department, Issac and Greg overnighted a new one and replaced it the very next day. In the end both Issac and Greg Jones did an excellent job and did so in a very friendly and down to earth manner. I would highly recommend this dealer and Issac to anyone. ",5.0
36,"April 01, 2015","I cannot say enough great things about Momentum Porsche or our sales guy Isaac. We have owned a lot of high line cars, but have never encountered a dealership so focused on the customer. We love our new 911 Cab!  Thanks",5.0
37,"March 17, 2015","Contacted John Hatfield via Momentum Porsche's Website. Was interested in a 2014 Boxster S in their inventory. He called me back. Checked to make sure it was in inventory. Sent me the Porsche build sheet on the car, did a prelim pricing on the trade ins. From my research all looked to be close on price. Schedule an appointment for the next day. They gave me some final numbers on the trades. Negotiated briefly on the price. They agreed. Deal done.  
From beginning to the end, my wife and I were out of the dealership driving our new Boxster S in 3 hours. ",5.0
38,"March 16, 2015","I was extremely pleased with the customer service me and my husband received from Brandon Morris and Greg Jones during the purchase of my Porsche.  We not only received a great deal, but they also made us feel like family!  We did not make a quick decision about the purchase and actually visited the location several times before we purchased the vehicle.  Each time we visited, Brandon and Greg welcomed us with a smile and gave us A-1 attention! 

I have visited other car dealerships in the past that once the salesman felt that you were not ready to make a purchase they no longer showed any interest in speaking with you.  I remember telling my husband that ""Brandon and Greg are real salesmen and they know what it takes to close a deal"".  I have to say that Porsche has two exceptional top performers that because they possess the one main ingredient for selling cars (know how to treat people) will take Porsche to the next level!  Thanks Brandon and Greg!",5.0
39,"February 25, 2015",I always feel very confident taking my Porsche to Momentum - it's my daily driver and Momentum takes pains to make sure my car is in fine running condition. Can't ask for more than that!  ,4.8
40,"January 27, 2015","Jennifer is the Pinnacle of first class service. Ordered a 2015 GT3 in Sept, Delivery Dec 30th
I must have changed my order in the Porsche Confg at least 30 times( visited the Config 100 times) Jenifer had to change my order at least 3 or 4 times when I would sent it too her saying this is the final build. She is a real Trooper, always listing to my doubts or worries about how the car would look. she always gave solid advice and worked with me thru the process I say this with great respect for the fact I would call her or text her almost everyday even on her days off she would answer. The GT3 is absolutely awesome. this the best Porsche I have ever purchased.
Mike Denny  is a Porsche guy in is own right. call him up he understands where your coming from
whether you ordering one or waiting on the dream to arrive. 
Thanks for a great buying experience

41,"December 23, 2014","I love, love my Porsche Cayenne. Thank you Momentum Porsche for the great customer service and for such a great deal. Chidi Amadi was one of the best. He made all the difference in the wonderful experience I had. The whole experience was fantastic! If I had to do it all over again, I would definitely choose Momentum Porsche.",4.8
42,"December 15, 2014","I have had very bad experiences with car dealerships previously but with Momentum Porsche, it was better than I could have expected. Chidi Amadi took great care of us and was a pleasure to work with. I would not hesitate to recommend the dealership to friends and family.",5.0
43,"December 02, 2014","Buying a car is already a big deal, specially when one has been driving another luxury brand for over 15 years. From the moment I walked in and drove away in my new car i felt confortable and taken cared of by my sales person and her manager. Every question was answered and I couldn't be happier with this purchase, I strongly recommend using Jennifer, she is a class act and her knowledge of the product is nothing but excellent. I never felt pressured and the process was very smooth and easy going.  Thank you for everything, you guys now have a client for life.  ",5.0
44,"December 01, 2014","Momentum made me a deal I could not refuse. being a long time BMW, Lexus and MB I had avoided Porsche out of lack of knowledge,  but Jennifer Sullivan at momentum challenged by to take a chance and am I glad i did. 

I love my new Cayenne and they made the sale process so easy and convenient. Upon my arrival I felt like I was the only one in the dealership based on the attention and care that was showered upon me. 

I do not think that I will be buying anything else in the future or from anywhere else.

Jennifer Sullivan was the best and I see a long tenure of Porsches in my garage.

45,"November 29, 2014","Customer Service is absolutely horrible. No one assisted me at all, and I waited to see if someone was going to help and even walked in the dealership..NOPE...no help at all. Unfriendly...totally..DO NOT shop here!",1.4
46,"November 24, 2014","Buying my new Macan has been an excellent experience!.  From the moment I ordered my new Macan (back in August 2014), everyone at the dealership was very friendly and helpful. Isaac took over my car order and kept me informed on the progress and expected arrival time.  Given my busy work schedule, Isaac was always on top of it and worked with me to complete the car purchase ahead of schedule. In my honest opinion, Isaac is the best!!!.I will certainly come back and recommend Momentum Porsche to my friends shopping for a new car.

47,"November 13, 2014","I found a car online and called in to see if it was still available.  Spoke with Brandon Morris who was very professional and courteous.    I had several questions and Brandon was able to e-mail me information right away- he was very responsive and did exactly what he said he was going to do, which is a big plus.  When I arrived at the dealership, I waited for a bit while Brandon finished up with another customer, then a bit longer while they got the car pulled out.  Test drive was excellent- amazing car.  We put together a very fair deal.  While the paperwork was drawn up, Brandon did a great job of keeping me entertained.  We took out another car in which he taught me how to use launch control- he took me to the service director to discuss potential upgrade options, then to Natalie to sign the paperwork.  Everything went very smoothly and was very easy- Great job!",5.0
48,"November 06, 2014","Called ahead to inquire of any availability of the Porsche Macan and happened to be transferred to Jennifer Sullivan. She was first class! I had some basic questions regarding options, pricing and such, which she was able to find out for me quickly. When we arrived, Jennifer was helping another client, and we were offered a drink as they had been expecting our arrival (coming in from out of town). Within 5 minutes, the car we inquired about viewing was backed in, fully fueled and ready for our examination. Jennifer had take the steps before our arrival to ""Wow"" us with what buying a Porsche entails.  Very low pressure in sales, and she made the deal easy to complete by working with us on our trade that was not in our possession at the time. Jennifer even traveled 100 miles each way to pick up our car after we had taken the keys to our new one. I would say that is going the extra mile...maybe 100?!  Needless to say, this is our first Porsche, hopefully with others to follow, and rest assured, Jennifer at Momentum will be our first call.",5.0
49,"November 02, 2014","I had a terrific experience dealing with Momentum-Porsche.  Everyone was very friendly and professional.  There was no pressure.  I felt very comfortable right off the bat with Isaac Tapias.  He put up with what were a lot of pretty basic questions - my first Porsche - without making me feel basic.  He gave me a great deal of information about things I would not have even thought to ask.  He was fair, honest and courteous.  Issac was even willing to help me shuttle my current car back to my house (I live 25 miles away) - eventually we did not need to do that but he was ready to help.  He continues to help me out - answer my question, etc. post sale.  No complaints.  Highly recommended.",5.0
50,"November 01, 2014","Our family visited Momentum Porsche closest to our home.  We strolled in with a sleeping 20 months toddler reclined in her bob stroller.  Upon entering we were not greeted at the door. The secretary did not even greet us. We explored the cayenne and the macan, looked at the colors available in the showroom.  We then strolled through the back parking lot in search of the 2015 cayenne ourselves because it was not on displayed at the showroom.  Even after >30 mins of being at the dealership, not a single porsche personnel acknowledged us.  We will certainly not be purchasing our 2015 cayenne from this dealership.  This was byfar the most disappointing car shopping experience that we have had.",1.0
51,"October 29, 2014","I had my wife test drive the new Macan S back in May when it was first unveiled at the dealership. We ordered one knowing it would take several months. This was not an issue now that we were downsizinng from 3 children and 2 dogs in multiple suburbans over 18 years into the fun to drive performance oriented Macan S - an empty nest plus. When ordering  my Sales Rep Isaac Tapias helped me sort through the match of our driving desires and the options we would leverage long term. This was a value added exercise, and after getting home I called back with several edits (upgrades), no problem doing this. The Macan S arrived a week early. We traded in our suburban and the prices exactly matched what I had calculated using Edmunds.com, so no further dialouge required. Natalie in Finance helped us select the right aftermarket items. Since this was our 14th purchased vehicle we did not take much time doing this, efficient and productive. We had test driven the Cayenne also, but the Macan S was the right match for us. With my selectd options our Macan performs even better than the test drive car. We are quite happy with our expeirnece at Momentum Porsche!",5.0
52,"October 17, 2014",I made contact to inquire on a Panamera with a Cayman S for trade-in.  Was able to cut out the back and forth and accomplished 99 percent of deal on email.

We agreed and within an hour I was driving away with my new car.  ,4.6

I just moved to Houston from Europe and was not familiar with all steps required when buying a car in the US. Jennifer arranged absolutely everything including documentation with my bank and she was always available over phone and email during the wait for my custom order. Such excellent and proactive service, she's is true customer care! Refreshing to work with a car sales representative who is intelligent, professional, personal (and beautiful).

Most importantly, I did not feel like just another person buying a car.

58,"September 03, 2014","I went in to dealership and found a vehicle that i was happy with, and decided to purchase without needing to special order.  Although my car was sold to me by a different salesperson, the really, truly excellent experience came when a salesperson by the name of Isaac, went above and beyond to be sure we were oriented well to our new car. Our initial salesperson was kind, but became very busy with another customer. It was at that time that Isaac stepped in and did what he could to help us.  He has also followed up with us to be sure that we were happy with our new car.
***We flew in from out of town to car shop and had a rental car.  I would have liked to have seen the dealership help us get the rental care returned.  I even asked for assistance and was not helped.

69,"August 15, 2014","I bought a used Cayenne on July 31st. I was assured the vehicle had been checked over and serviced before they put it up for sale. I drove it two days and the service engine light came on. Later that day the car started dumping coolant. They took care of it and I thanked them. I told my salesman that I appreciated it and would have understood if I would have had to pay for it. Those were my exact words to him and it was the truth. They didn't have a good reason why the service light had come on after they told me the car had been serviced. They side stepped my question about it. When I asked about it later I was told by the service manager that it had been done and it may have been a vehicle malfunction that the light came on. If it was serviced and the light came on it could probably be only be a couple of things. The mechanic didn't reset the light or the service wasn't done. Either way, it shows the lack of quality control that you would expect from a dealership of that caliber.   I'm now starting to question how accurate is the vehicle check out sheet they gave me before I purchased the car.   The salesman also told me that the part on the coolant that went bad usually has to be changed at 70,000 miles. A part on the cooling system that has a mileage life on it? I don't believe that one. They told me that it would take more time than they had first thought. I told them I didn't have any issue with that. I would rather them take their time and get it done right was my exact words to the service manager. I picked up the car just yesterday. After I picked it up and started driving it, I  heard banging noises like it was being hit from the bottom with a sledge hammer. I felt it all the way up through the center concole where my arm was resting. The car started to drive bad, shake, and had no acceleration. I pulled over to check what was wrong and the engine cover underneath the car had come unhooked and was dragging the ground. The back piece of the panel was gone and what was left still hanging had 1 bolt left in it facing up towards the driveshaft. All the other bolts were gone. Someone didn't put all the bolts back in and secure it before they gave it back to me. There's the quality control issue I spoke of earlier.  It was only attached to the very front of the vehicle so it had slammed the undercarriage of the car numerous times. The service manager would later tell me that  the banging on the bottom couldn't have damaged the drive shaft. I called the dealership and told them what happened and wanted to send him a picture. He said don't worry about it because he knows what an engine panel hanging down looks like. Big mistake on my part because he would later tell me that didn't happen. I was lying to him. I then had to climb underneath the car and take the screws out from the front of the car so I could get it off and would be able to drive the car. I brought it in today and I am told that the drive shaft is worn out. 70,000 mile and it's worn out. That's hard to believe. Especially since the car was driving fine before the undercarriage came off.  I have been told it's my problem that their mechanic didn't install the bolts in the engine cover correctly but that had nothing to do with the drive shaft being worn out. Believe that one? Now he is starting to insult my intelligence and it get worse. I was first told that the cover couldn't hurt anything because it was made of cordboard. Then told the cover was only there to stop water from splashing on to the bottom of the car. This is from the service manager. That makes no sense. Cordboard comes apart in water. Wow. I now realize he will say anything to get out of their responsibility. When I don't agree, then he said it was only plastic. I asked about him about  the metal part at the back end of the cover that is about 4 inches by 10 inches.   Then I was told that was the only metal part on there and couldn't have caused any damage. Metal is metal. To tell me there is no metal on the cover is absurd. It's on there no matter what they say. I was then told that all the bolts were in the cover, which is completely untrue. I gave them the bolts and there was at least 3 missing. I confronted him about the lie, he then admits that all the bolts weren't there. How crazy is that?  I'm told that the cover slamming against the drive train didn't damage anything. Then I'm told that it didn't come apart or drag the ground. I am the one who dealt with all the issues but they are going to tell me what didn't happen to a car that was working fine when I picked it up. They will say anything to get out of fixing what their employee damaged. I have a hard time believing that the drive shaft worn out at the same time the cover came off the bottom. Same exact day. Think it's a coincidence? I don't. Sounds like an excuse to not stand behind their workmanship. What would you think? Lack of quality control? What's even worse is I have been a momentum customer for many years. I have bought numerous BMWs from their other dealerships. The last one was in January of this year. This is the worse situation I have ever had to deal with with any dealer I have bought from. Don't think they won't do it to you. I'm a long time customer. What I find disturbing is I am being lied to about the bolts all being there, the service engine light coming after a few days, the engine cover being made of cordboard and doesn't have any metal on it.....I can go on and on. I realize that all the good things I believed about Momentum's dealerships and how they take care of the customer isn't true. I can't tell everyone how disappointed I am in this lack of reasonability that the service dept is not  willing to take after the result of their repair was only more damage to the vehicle. Proof of this is all the false statements that were made to me. Only to be admitted after I confronted them and called BS. If there are this many issues with a car that only has 70.000 miles on it and has been inspected for sale and weren't caught, go buy something you will get a little more life out of. I bought from the dealer because I thought I would get good service and would be told the truth. Boy, was I wrong. I have decided to bring it to another shop that is qualified to tell me exactly what happen because I know I will never get the truth from them. I wait to see what will happen after an independent third party gets the opportunity to look at the vehicle and check it to see exactly what happened. I'm curious to find out if all the service and inspection claims they made about the vehicle to me before I bought it are true or was the report just pencil wiped .  I am willing to stand behind everything I've written in this review.  If anything is untrue or inaccurate, they can sue me for slander. EVERYONE STAY TUNED. I'LL POST A FOLLOW UP REVIEW ON THE RESULTS.  IF THEY ARE CORRECT, I'LL ADMIT I WAS WRONG AND GO ON DOWN THE ROAD. Question is, what'll happen if I'm correct? Think they will admit being wrong?
UPDATE; Monday 9-18. I picked up the vehicle this morning to bring it to a different shop and get a second opinion. When they put the vehicle up on the rack I found out a couple of things. First, the service manager had told me the only thing they would be willing to do was to put a new engine guard on the vehicle. There was another engine guard on it alright but it wasn't the one that came with the car when I bought it. I always thought when you deal with a dealership you don't have to worry about them switching parts. It may be Porsche but it's not the one that was there before  It was completely different and didn't cover near the area the previous one did. I called to find out about the old guard and were it was at. The service manager had told me on Friday that there was no marks on the guard so it couldn't have dragged the ground. I told him I would be there today and I could show him the marks that were all over the guard.  When I ask for the guard today I find out it was thrown away.  He then tells me I should have let them know I wanted the guard back, like it's my fault they threw it away. Just when I thought it couldn't get any worse, I'm shown by the new mechanic inspecting the car that there is a fluid leak under the vehicle that for some reason the Momentum mechanic didn't discover. If he did, nothing was said to me about it.  I sent an email to the service dept asking if they would check with the mechanic that worked on it  to see if he saw the leak.  It would have been hard to miss but I sure it just goes back to the quality control issues I've experienced all along the way. I'm curious to find what's the excuse for this one.  Maybe I should have asked if anything was leaking under there?  STAY TURNED.",1.0

I have used another dealer North of Houston since purchasing my car, due to ""stories"" about Momentum, and quite honestly,  Porsche North did nice work, had ""nice"" service, but never had parts in inventory, and I had to make multiple trips. In other words, it was not exemplary.

I had an incident, and needed to utilize the closest dealership.  From the moment I arrived, the Service Manager, Jeff Pollard, took great care.  Welcoming, getting necessary information, and telling me when I would be contacted.   His service member, Henry Yeung, contacted me before Jeff told me he would, gave me the analysis, and options, and handled everything in a timely manner.   He followed up with calls and emails.

I will return, and test them again, but as a first experience, this is what service should be like, it was even better than Lexus (when Lexus use to provide exceptional service).  Kudos to Jeff and his staff.",5.0

Isaac and the Momentum team worked hard to put the deal together long distance.  I flew in from California, Isaac picked me up at the airport, I took delivery of the car hassle free and had a wonderful road trip home.  Isaac has been following up to make sure everything is OK.

While the car was having the above work done I also needed an oil change. However when I came to pick up the car I checked the oil level before driving away and the oil sensor reported a minimal amount of oil (only showing the first small mark on the gauge). I was expecting it to be at the maximum mark so that I don't immediately have to top it up myself.

This was especially annoying as the bill had charged me for 10 quarts which is more than enough to fill the car.

I also feared that the mechanic had forgotten to fill the car up after the old oil had been drained out and worried as to what damage may have occured to the car as a result of that. I later read that there is a separate low oil level warning and that my car was only low on oil not out of oil.

To top the oil up the mechanic drove my car back to the service area. This meant that they (and I) had to wait over 25 minutes while the car's computer allowed another reading to be taken of the oil level. This was annoying but in no way Richard's fault. Richard was as pleasant and professional as usual to deal with.

The oil was topped up to the max.

139,"February 28, 2012","The sales effort was great, the car I called about was located before i left for the dealership and was outside waiting by the door for me to arrive.  when it was not exactly what I wanted Jennifer found me the car I needed quickly and had it prepared overnight.  

Like all used cars there are tiny issues however the difference with this dealership is they addressed them. When I had a small issue with a squeak, Jeff the service manager rode with me and waited for it to show itself.  Then amazingly he diagnosed in less than 2 miles the issue, a solution, and discovered another that I had not yet noticed much less reported.  Upon our return to the dealership they provided me with a newer Porsche to drive (of course I now want to move up to that one)and made the repairs on time and correct the first time. Overall i am more than pleased with this dealership, and based upon my experience really question the derogatory comments on this site.  As a vacation destination developer and home builder i am acutely aware of the need for service and set my standards high, this dealership exceeded them, and that's no easy task.  Sales, and Service are great.  I purchased a used 2006 911 and they made sure everything was perfect. ",4.8
140,"February 28, 2012","My purchase (CPO 2006 Boxter) experience with Jennifer Sullivan was superior. Price (deal) was fair and follow through was exceptionally pleasant and efficient.
Through the following two years my service experiences have been excellent.  Chase and Richard are very personable and exhibit a sincere interest in pleasing me.  Their service department has proven to be thorough and efficient.
I enjoy my roadster and am so pleased for the wonderful experience with Momentum Porsche.

He answered all of our questions and went out of his way to make sure that we were well taken care of. Momentum had the largest inventory of CPO Cayennes in Houston at the time we were searching for one. Based on our experience with Matt, we would go back to Momentum in the future.",5.0

143,"May 11, 2011","Greetings to all.
Sadly I did not visit this website prior to my purchase. Long story short.
Bought a 911 turbo 1991 reg over the internet. Thought i was safe buying it from a mainstream dealer. Boy was I wrong. Said it had all the paperwork, service history etc in leather pouch.

Got the car shipped to me.  Had a scratch on the hood, Momo claim no responsibility at all, and only half the service history showed up.  Called them up, was told tough, said they never had the service history, funny that.  Managed to get in touch with the origional owner and he said, yep gave everything to them in a leather pouch, same one they mentioned on the phone prior to the sale.

If I lived in TexasI would take them to court/ take an add out in the local paper.   They are about as useful/helpful as a cat flap in a submarine.  They lie and when caught out shift the blame.  I am surprised they are in business.  The head of the outfit, Ben Dugger never replies to emails or calls. The business manager just said, before my time!

DO NOT GIVE THESE PEOPLE YOUR BUSINESS.  Better off giving it to a charity or uncle Sam.  They deserve to go out of business, not have yours.

Love to all,

144,"November 24, 2010","These guys fixed my Porsche before I bought it from their sister store (Momentum BMW). Said they fixed the overheating problem but really just hid the problem. I bought the car, found out they lied and called to talk to them about it. They quoted me $468 more than the Porsche dealer across town that had not previously screwed me. Then the service manager said he would cut me a deal and only charge me $270 more than the other Porsche dealer. Stay away from these guys! They are thieves and they are not interested in return business!!!",1.2
145,"September 30, 2010","My husband and I were interested in a porsche 911 at Momentum Porsche.  I called about the car and talked to Brandon who said today is the last day of the month, come in and we could make a deal.  I told him I would arrive at noon, which I did.  After some negotiation, Zack Lawrence, the internet sales manager, entered the dealings.  I left Momentum Porsche at 1 pm with the figures I needed, and contacted my husband as to what we were looking at.  We decided to go for it, and I went to the bank and got a cashier's check.  At 2 pm I called Zack and said I have a cashiers check, can we do deal for $1,000 less?  He said it wasn't his call, it was his GM's, the GM was out until 3 pm, he would call me then.  Zack did call at 3pm and said deal stands as is, I said ok we would accept, when can we do the deal?  We finally decided on that day, because it was the last day of the month, and my husband would meet me at the dealer ship at 6:30 for closing.

After several more phone calls, the last being about 4:50 same day with Zack to firm up what we needed to close and to provide info to expedite closing, Zack calls at 5:20 (a mere thirty minutes after last phone call to discuss items needed at closing) and prefaces the conversation with ""This is a hard phone call for me to make""...  Zack called to tell me that he had sold the car to someone else.  I was absolutely floored.  My question was ""how could you do this, thirty minutes ago we were working out the closing???!!!""  He then proceeded to tell me several variations of what happen, and both of them were baloney.  First, he said whoever shows up with money first gets the car.  I said we had a scheduled closing at 6:30, I have been in touch with you all afternoon since I left your showroom at 1:15!  Then he proceeded to tell me that his GM sold the car and Zack did not know anything about it until it was too late.  I then talked to the GM, Colby, who was in a slime category all his own, and the CYA stories began again.  My husband arrived at the dealership to close at almost the same time, and to say he was upset was an understatement.  Zack and Colby proceeded to tell him absolute bull regarding issues that Zack and I had addressed.  My husband got the four of us on a conference call and, needless to say, the truth came out regarding timeline and my numerous phone calls with Zack. 

Bottomline, as one previous reviewer notes, BUYER BEWARE.  The Porsche is an astounding product and for a good reason.  However, why would Sonic Automotive, a Fortune 500 company and owner of Momentum, want such absolutely dishonorable, lying salesmen and GM representing their dealership?   ",1.0
146,"May 23, 2010","I purchased a ""pristine "" Porsche c4S cab , that was advertised on the internet , the car was a low mile , high priced vehicle . It was shipped to me on the West Coast. When it arrived it was not as described or as shown in the numerous photos.  The car had paint damage, discoloration, bad scratches , and a well used interior . Jennifer Sullivan has been extreemly frustrating to deal with and has now disappeared , the G.M s voicemail box is always full , and nobody will take calls , this is a disgrace, hopefully I will get resolution in court.
Avoid this dealership, Buyer BEWARE ! ",2.5
147,"November 18, 2009","I would like to tell you about my unpleasant buying experience I had at your dealership.    I have purchased approximately 25 cars in my lifetime.  I can unequivocally stay that I have never been lied too or been more deceived by any salesperson than I was at your dealership.I purchased a used 2005 E500 on November 4th from Zack Lawrence.  I viewed this car on your Internet site on November the 3rd.  I completed the ""Black Book Online"" portion on your website.  Soon after this I was contacted by Zack.  We discussed the car.  He then forwarded me the Car fax information on the car.  I saw that the car had had many repairs for a car with  48,000 miles.  According to your advertisement on the website it stated that there was still a one year warranty left on the vehicle.  I showed this information to one of my employees.  We discussed the fact that since the car has had a number of problems the one year warranty was beneficial if I were to purchase the car.  I went to your dealership Wednesday afternoon to look at the vehicle.  Zack and I came to agreement on the price.  I obtained the financing.  Once I sat down with Tim Dunham to complete the paperwork to purchase the vehicle.  When it came to the warranty he presented me a document that stated it was an ""As Is Warranty"". I told him that this was incorrect.  There was still one year left on the warranty.  Tim called Zack in the office.  Zack stated that there was still one year left on the warranty.  The warranty would not expire until November 2010.  Tim then completed a new document stating their was a warranty on the vehicle. 

  

On November 8th the air conditioner stopped working. I called Zack at approximately 0915 on November the 9th.  He said to bring the car down and he would take a look at it.  I immediately brought the car to your dealership.  Zack was not available.  Another salesperson looked at the car.  He said ""yep, your air conditioner is not working.  We don't fix it here.  You need to take it to a Mercedes dealership"".  Zack should have told this to me before I made the trip to your dealership.  I then took the car to the Mercedes dealership.  I told them that I had one year left on the warranty.  They immediately processed my car and gave me a loaner car.  Approximately one hour later I received a call from the Mercedes dealership stating that the warranty had expired on October 31st 2009.  I told them their must be some mistake because I was told there was one year left on the warranty.  I have the warranty information in the glove compartment. I told them I would call the dealer I purchased this car from to straighten out the confusion.  I immediately called Zack.  He said he would look into it and call the Mercedes dealership and then call me back.  I did not here back from Zack.  I called the Mercedes dealership approximately two hours later.  I was told Zack did call, but he left a message.  The Mercedes representative stated he would call Zack back as soon as we got off of the phone. I called Zack about an hour later.  He had not spoken to the Mercedes representative as of yet.  He said he would try again.  I did not here from him the rest of the day. 

  

On November the 10th the Mercedes dealership called me and told me my car was ready for pickup.  They said there would be no charge because all they did was put freon in the air conditioning system.  I called Zack that morning. He said that the car did not have a warranty.  I told him that is not what he told me when I purchased the vehicle.  I told him that I expect them to honor what was promised to me.  He said that he would ""discuss this with the GM and get back with me"".  I did not here back from him the rest of the day. 

  

On November the 11th I drove down to your dealership.  I met with Zack.  He stated the car did not have a warranty.  He had done some research and I could purchase a warranty for one year for $1500.00 or a two year warranty for $2000.00.  I told him this was unacceptable.  I saw on the website that this car had another year left on the warranty, and that you told me that it still have a year left on the warranty.  I then said did you not state this?  Zack said ""yes I did"".  He then asked what can we do to fix the problem.  I stated ""honor the warranty"".  He said he would ask the person who places the ads on the Internet to pull up the ad and we would call me back.  I did not here from him.  I called him later in the afternoon.  He said they did not see on the advertisement that there was a one year warranty.  I told them I had seen it, and so did one of my employees.  I then told him that I have a document that states it does have a warranty.  He said to fax it to him.  I faxed and email the document to him.  I did not hear back from him the rest of the day.  I did not call him on November the 12th.  On November the 13th I went down to your dealership.  I had went to your front desk and asked the representative to speak to you.  She stated you were not here.  Even though I saw you standing approximately 25 feet away from me. That is very unprofessional on her part.  I then asked to speak to Kelly Wolf.  He was standing approximately 2 feet away from me.  At least he had the sense to say who he was.  I then introduced myself to him and asked to talk with him.  We then went into Zack""s office.  I explained the situation to him.  He said he was aware of the situation. He asked how we could solve this problem.  I said honor what was promised to me.  He asked to see the warranty document I had in my possession.  I showed it to him.  He then made a phone call to see how much it would cost for a one year warranty.  Once he obtained the cost he told me that he would have Tim process the paperwork for the warranty. 

  

I do appreciate Tim for doing the right thing.  However, he should have followed up with Zack before I had to make two trip's down to the dealership, and multiple phone calls.  Or he should have made the call to me.  When I was at the dealership on the 13th Zack did not even have the balls to come up to me and say he was sorry for the mistake or inconvenience he had caused me.    I would be ashamed to have someone of Zack's caliber represent my business.  I would also be dissappointed to have a receptionist flat out lie to customer's.  I understand you are a busy man, and may not want to speak with everyone who comes in to your business if they do not have an appointment.    I would never have my assistant lie that I was not there.  To me it did not appear you were busy because I watched you while I was in your business and you walked around talking to the salesperson's, and at times sat at there desks talking with them.  We are both in the customer service industry.  It would have gone a long way with me if you would have spent a few minutes to talk to me while I was in your business.
