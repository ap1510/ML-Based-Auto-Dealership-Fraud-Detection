Yesterday I purchased a used car from this dealer. After every thing was finished. I go to finance office ! Piece a cake right . WRONG. We go through a stack a paper work and Im signing away and then! What the h*ll I look at loan papers and they had added $1299 dollars for some paint and fabric coating. Also $2400 extended warrenty I did not ask for ! Im a 71 year old grandmother but Im not dead yet! Let me add that I made appointmen to see a certain vehicle that some how was sold becore I got there. I will post this as many places as I can ! ",1.0
1,"September 29, 2018","I get a 9am appt, for a mazda recall that should take less than 10 minutes. They say its going to be 2 hrs- i say fine, ill go run an errand and be back. They quickly take the car back like they’re going to work on it but here i sit, for hours... no errand. The service manger is a xxxxx when i approached him about it. Service writers are liars. I’ll never be back, xxxx sure wont buy a car here. They don’t know how to treat customers. They’re “comfy lounge” is some crappy tables and chairs. Find somewhere else to do car business, this place sux.",1.0
2,"June 25, 2018","I was once a satisfied  customer, but not anymore.  When I first got my 2014 Nissan Versa with salesman Andy and Izza who are no longer there, things were well. However, now that I'm trying to trade my car in, I'm getting nothing but rejections, and getting my hopes high all for nothing.  So the first time, I was turned down because I wasn't at my job long enough (even though I was emailed by World Car about a trade in - getting my hopes high for nothing). Recently, I went back to see if I could trade my car in, but this time they said that I'm not making enough despite the fact that I have never been late with any of my car payments, or need any help paying my bills. 

So, I get yet another tempting email about how my car is HIGH DEMAND for trade off, so I go back yet again...thinking that things would be different since I got the email and made an appointment. I was only met with the exact same nonsense of not being paid enough to get a loan or something like that. I was suggested to get a co-signer which I wasn't going to do, and NO, I'm not looking for another job either. Couple this with going through the trouble of having to prove that I actually have a job, I felt like I totally wasted another trip believing the hype of vague emails.

No more, and never again with World Car Mazda. My car is in good shape, but I'll trust in the Lord and find some place else to trade this car in. It's not so much that the salesmen were jerks, but I've had enough of having my hopes toyed with. There must be another place that'll take my car without all the nonsense.",1.4
3,"June 07, 2018","Made an appointment to diagnose an issue. had my car the whole day called once to update me that they had not found the issue and then never called back again. I called them close to closing time and they didn't answer. I had to call sales because they stay open later than service but was told they couldn't assist me, and that someone would call me around 10am the next day. Never told me they were keeping my vehicle overnight so that i was able to make arrangements for transportation to work. They called the next day saying they were still working on it and that the reason they were slow is that they put others ahead of me who said they would wait on the premises. Finally called me around 2pm and said it would cost $2200 dollars to fix issue. I don't usually complain but customer satisfaction is not their top priority, and I will vote with my wallet by Staying away from this place!  ",1.2

just now

I took my wife's kia to get it checked for abs,hill assist and traction control lights being on. All I wanted was for the vehicle to be checked. 3 hours later they tell me the car is fixed and they were open recalls. Great they fixed my problem and something else with the kia transmission. I leave grateful everything is ammended. I head to work for the remainder of the day. As I'm leaving work I notice my kia is acting up and the starter is spinning and not starting and some noise in the engine. I'm thinking odd so I head home. Once I get home the vehicle is having problems starting. I call kia and let them know what going on they said mo problem bring it in and well take care of it. I show up the next morning at 730 they take the vehicle to get checked no updates for 4 hours. Finally someone comes to talk to me to let me know the starter is going out. They had the kia in their possession and I had no problems prior to them working on it and start blaming me when all I wanted was my car fixed. They offered to fix it for the high price of $500. Here's what's not right and I hope you be careful when getting your car serviced at this location. I had no ignition problems prior to taking the car in now I have a problem. No one took accountability for the error they made at kia. I feel like I was cheated by world car kia and I would not reccomend or ever purchase another kia. You should have taken care of your customer and I hope who ever reads this thread lightly on doing business with world car kia as it seems they are out to ruin your vehicle. I now have a problem vehicle over the wrong doing of your service department.

5,"April 11, 2018","Not only can they not install factory accessories, they cannot change the oil without an oil leak.

I had my oil changed 5 days ago at this dealership and found approximately a cup of oil on my garage floor.",1.6
6,"February 09, 2017","Went in knowing they were just down the street from my work, and came across a vehicle that I actually liked (a 2014 Lancer).  Did some research on it, and turns out their price was a bit higher than FMV for a dealer.  (Not a big deal, right?  That's why you negotiate.)

Anyhow, so I start to talk it over with Mary and one of the managers, and they tell me that they 'price to sell' and 'can't negotiate.'  Being a reasonable person, I understand that sometimes companies pay too much for their cars, etc., so I thank them for their time and am on my way.  At this point, they'd still have a 5 star review, if not for the following:

Next day they call me back, asking to have me come in again and telling me that they are willing to negotiate (okay, that happens).  I come in, point out FMV, and tell them that is my firm offer.  They offer me $250 less than their original asking price (and $300 above FMV).  I explain why that is not acceptable, point out the damage on the vehicle, point out a competing offer I have open from another dealer for a newer version of the same vehicle (with lower mileage and a cleaner title) for a fraction more than they're asking ($700 more, to be specific, for a year newer and 30k mi rather than 55k...oh, and automatic rather than manual).  I tell them that I will make one final offer...I'll pay them $50 ABOVE FMV, and not a penny more.

They wander around helping other people for another 15 minutes, then tell me ""you do our price we already gave or no deal.""  Not only is this a complete waste of my time, but it's insulting.

So, THANK YOU for wasting my time, World Car.",1.2

8,"September 23, 2016","I purchased  a new car from dealership fell good about my purchase. But it's when I had to take it in for service at the dealership. The worst
Service ever I think the girl that waited on me was more worried about being off the clock then on the clock.. she reminded me that they were closing in a hour. And it was like they never checked reason my  tire  light was on.  Even thou it is under  service warranty she recommended  me to take my car to another place down the street firestone. They no longer do tire repairs so, my tire light is still on. The worst service center  ever  I would recommend any other dealership. STILL NOT SATISFIED! !!!!!!",1.0

10,"March 31, 2016","I purchased my vehicle from this dealership three years ago, and felt good about the decision.  However, last week, I called the service department because my ABS, Traction Control, and Incline lights were all on.  I was connected with a man in the service department, and I explained that the lights came on after I had new tires put on.  He immediately responded that the tire techs must have damaged the rear wheel sensor, and there wasn't anything he could do about it under warranty.  I asked if I should bring it in to be looked at to see if there really was damage, and he said I could take it anywhere to get is diagnosed if I felt like it, but since warranty wouldn't cover it, there was no point in bringing it in.  My husband took my car to another local Kia dealership (Legend), and they determined that there was no damage, but there was a defect in the rear wheel sensor.  They replaced it the same day.  Fast forward a couple of days, and suddenly my battery light was on, and my in-dash screen was flashing ""Battery Discharge Warning"" in the middle of the highway while it's raining.  I was really worried about what this warning could mean...in smaller type, it read, ""...to avoid discharge"".  This sounded dangerous given my surroundings.  I happened to be driving downtown at the time, so I decided to stop into the World Car service department for help.  I got lost on the way and ended up stopping at an Auto Zone who tested my battery and determined that my 5 month old battery was low, and while they suspected it was the alternator, the charge was too low to confirm.  When I finally made it to World Car, I had to search for a human upon entering the building.  Eventually I found a person who paged someone from the service department-- I waited.  I suspect it was the same man I spoke to on the phone a few days before, because again, I was met with the same apathy and was told that they were backed up a week, but I could leave my car if I wanted.  I asked if they had loaner vehicles, ""no""; what alternatives do I have, ""don't know""; if I take my car to a private mechanic, would the alternator be covered under warranty there if that was the problem, ""probably not""...and so on.  It felt like he was going out of his way to not be helpful.  I would have appreciated even a little helpful guidance.  I tried hard to remain calm, but I got tired of the short, apathetic, insolent responses and decided to call Legend Kia's service department from World Car's parking lot.  Legend Kia told me to bring my car right in, and they would take care of me.  I was thankful the battery allowed me to get that far, and my alternator was replaced within 6 hours despite being busy.  And they offered me a shuttle ride home-- that is real customer service.  World Car could definitely learn a thing or two (or twenty) from them. I will never return to World Car...not for service, nor to purchase another vehicle.",1.0
11,"November 04, 2015","This dealership ripped me off and will not warranty their work.  
I took my vehicle to World Car Kia, 4220 Fredericksburg, San Antonio, TX  (210-732-2222), 3 months ago and after two weeks of xxxx they finally replaced my compressor and another part.  
Now no cold air again.  I go back to the dealership and they say the air conditioner discharge hose has a small hole in it and all of my Freon has leaked out.  When I took it in before - I had a full charge of Freon and no hole in my hose.  They will not warranty their work after admitting that their tech did disconnect the hose and he might have kinked it and it caused the hole but since it has been 3 months they will not warranty their work.  
I took it to another reputable auto repair shop and another KIA dealership in San Antonio and called several air conditioner shops and all of them told me to go back to dealership and demand they fix it.  Everyone has stated with such a small hole (that you cannot see by the naked eye and you have to see it with the dye) that it could take 3 months for the Freon to leak out.  They all stated if the tech did not disconnect the hose - then this would have not happened and everyone is shocked that they are not warranting their work.    
So I did go back and I talked to the service manager - Gilbert (and then called the general manager - Jeff).  Both admitted that their tech did disconnect the hose and that he could have kinked it and put the hole in it.  But since I did not come back for 3 months they will not honor it.  I told them that everyone said with such a tiny hole that it would take 3 months for it to go out and I cannot help that he did not put a bigger hole in it and it all leak out faster so that I would know and I would have been back sooner.  
So I did not have a hole in the hose and I did have full Freon.  The tech did disconnect the hose to put in the compressor.  If he would have not touched the hose - I would not be sending this to you.  It was their fault and now I am to pay $400 or $500 for a hose and Freon.  I have told all my co-workers and many shops in town and they cannot believe it....that they admit their tech disconnected the hose and will not warranty it.  Stay away from this dealership and KIA.",1.0
12,"September 21, 2015","It is with a very heart that I write this review! I bought my Suzuki there in 2007 and I have been taking my car there for oil change. This year in April,I'm was told that my car had a leak. I took it in to be fixed. When it came out it started making a grinding noise. I took it back in. After few days they called me to let me know that it was the valves. They wanted my permission to fix it! I gave them permission! They called me to let me know that the car was ready! I went there and started the car I. From of one of the service agent. It was making more noise than when I had taken it in. After challenging him, he told me that the camshafts had to be changed.bthey were charging me around $2000 for the previous work which did not solve my problem and they wanted me to pay $1100 for the camshafts plus labor. After discussion, they agreed for me to pay for the parts only and that labor was going to be the one they charged me for installing the valves. I went ahead and bought my camshafts for $638.00 and took them to them. They installed them and they called me to pick up the car. I paid them the $1400 they wanted. After a week or two my car started making noise again! Being a priest, I asked one of of my parishioners to look at it. Guess what? Their so called factory certified technicians had put the tensioner backward! I called them to inform them of what they had done. They said that their technicians could not make a mistake like that ! They asked me to take the car in. I told them that I did not trust them anymore. My parishioner tried to order the part but it was dealership only! So I had to go back there and they refuse to admit that they had made a mistake! Gilbert, the service manager said that he stood by his factory certified technicians! I told him that even the best doctors make mistake! He could not admit that! So I tried to order the parts from. Them, they wanted me to pay $136.00. The internet had it for $87.00. So I decided to sever my relationship with them. From April to August, they got  around $5,000.00 and never fixed my car. Guess what else? I had at least a dozen screws and clips missing from my car! I am very disappointed ! If you have to go for oil change, that's all right. If it is something more, beware of their so called technicians! They just guess what the problem is! Of cause they want to be making money out of you so it will be one thing after another! They will be the one destroying your car so that you can take it back there and pay more money! So beware!!!",1.4
13,"August 09, 2015","My experience at this dealership has been fabulous since I first visited two years ago.  I bought my first Kia there.  In May 2015, my wife and I were watching the TV commercials for the new 2016 Sorento.  While running errands one day,  we stopped to take a closer look at them.  That's when I met Chris Trevino.  His attention to detail and disposition to help were par none!  I decided then to trade my 2013 for a new one.   Better yet, since then, I hear from him every so often to make sure all is good and offering to help with whatever we would need.  It doesn't get better than that!!!",5.0
14,"July 24, 2014","My experience at World Car Auto Group (Mazda) was more than pleasant.

18,"November 27, 2013","Why I have given this rating is because this is my second time coming there and bought time I lost my on insurance on a car. The first time was in August I was buying a 2008 Nissan Sentra as the the deal as going down with the finance and world car kia I notice the car had something wrong with it so I Took the car back I only had the car for 4 days then I talk to the manager he had service department to look at it and found out the Transmission was not work right, and a few other things wasn't working we when after the transmission first it still had warranty on the transmission so I drove it to the dealer to fix the transmission they took three days after I pick up the car the  it was worst the wheel was trying to lock on me while I was driving the car it was dangerous to drive. The inspection sticker was going out in two days. I said I will wait until you all get car in like. Because they chose that car for me and that was a big mistake. The second reason I seen a car on the internet a Chevrolet Malibu 2009 blue vin #1GLZH57B59F18927  I call their and talk to the sale person  and told her about the car when I got their the manager Jim
just took over he did the deal with out the finance man he push the deal saying that he raising the price of the by 1,000 dollars but he still was going to sale it to me for the same price. He was pressuring me to get a warranty on the car 34.00 month for the warranty I said my bankruptcy only let me pay that much, he told me not to sorry about that he had me to get insurance and told me I couldn't get the car until the bank pay him he want his money first. So that next morning i call to see if the car still have warranty on and it did so I call Jim back and told him I didn't want the warranty he has a fix he said no the do not have warranty he said that the warranty is over at 60,000 miles the Malibu have 62,000 miles.

It still more little things but I'm going to end this complaint with Jim sent the papers work to the finance company with the warranty on it after i told him to take it off. I lost auto insurance money 149.00 twice. And still no car.",1.0

Mostly this is for routine service, but if there ever is a special problem or concern, he is very helpful in aiding us to make the right decision regarding repairs, etc. World Car has always been able to solve our problems for us, and we believe the prices are fair.",5.0

22,"March 11, 2013","I was looking for a used vehicle to purchase online on Auto trader.com, when I came across the vehicle I was interested in the dealership was World Car on Fredericksburg rd. I stopped by after work, and took a look at the vehicle went ahead and test drove it. I was interested in purchasing the vehicle. So they went ahead and did some paperwork to run my credit. I sat there for about 1.5 hours and they told me the banks were closed that they will get back to me tomorrow morning when they got some more responses back. So I left the dealership, the next day it was noon still no call or anything. So i ended up calling back myself. Then then told me "" well the sales man dealing with that deal is off for the day!"" I asked if anyone else could help, he said yes to give him a few hours and he would call me back with some responses. He then called back and said that they amount the bank approved for was less than the amount of loan I needed. I then asked him if had called the current back that was financing my car that I wanted to trade in? He said no. So i went ahead and went to the bank myself, I did get approved for the amount I needed they faxed over all paperwork to the dealer ship and all I had to do was go into the dealership and sign some paperwork and I would be good. When i got to the dealer I waited over 3 hours, customer service was horrible, the car was not even ready or washed. less that a quarter of gas. It was just the worst experience buying a vehicle ever!! I pretty much did the deal my self, they did not care to call me back or sell the car. The customer service showed no signs of wanting referrals from happy customers. I  wouldn't refer anyone to go there. I also asked to speak to the sales manager which was Manny and he as well was saying that its not their fault they were doing 8 deals at once and that they were busy, he seemed frustrated to hear my concerns about how his sales team was handling their customers and showed no sign of ownership. Poor poor customer service. ",1.6
23,"November 21, 2012","My first impression of this dealership was that they were willing to work with me to make a deal on the vehicle I wanted. I emailed them about the vehicle I liked, told them I was approved for a set amount, and they stated they could sell me the vehicle I liked for that price out the door. I then called them after work to confirm the details of the vehicle and price. They again agreed to the deal, and told me to come in to finish everything. When I arrived at the dealership, I was shown the vehicle we discussed, test drove the vehicle, and agreed to buy. After waiting for them to submit the paperwork to my bank, they told me the vehicle doesn't meet my bank's loan to value amount, and that I would need to put money down, or apply directly through them. We agreed to try financing through them, but while we were waiting to hear about the decision, we noticed the paperwork they submitted to our bank showed an older vehicle with higher mileage that the vehicle we had discussed and test drove previously. When we asked them why it showed that, they said it must have been a mistake, but refused to resubmit the correct vehicle to my bank, just telling me it won’t work. After a little while, the finance manager came out to tell us they weren't going to honor the deal we were originally promised multiple times, because when he approved the price, he was only approving the older, higher mileage vehicle, even though that was a vehicle we never discussed. We wasted over 3 hours of our day looking at and discussing a vehicle the dealership had no intention of selling to us!",2.0
