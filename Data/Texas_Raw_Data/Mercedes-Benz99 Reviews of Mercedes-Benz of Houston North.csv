0,"June 12, 2020",Mercedes should take this dealership back from AutoNation! We purchased a used car and have had a major issue and they would not let another dealership perform warranty work demanding we bring the car back to them from out of town. We have called Keith in customer service many many times and he has never returned our calls. This place sucks. Find another place to buy a car! ,1.0

I recently had three deaths in just two weeks prior to this, and the day of my appointment for an oil change was the day of my fathers services followed by his burial the next day. My previous call to this dealership to inquire about possibly having a loaner car during my maintenance wasn’t very pleasant however I still choose this service department to perform the first maintenance of my vehicle. I had been under the impression my contact person would be Steve Davis, however when I arrived Chris Montoya was the gentleman who checked me in. Besides having an oil change, I brought up two other issues I asked to be looked into. Three hours after waiting in the lobby I had a hard time locating Chris and when I finally did find him he had already began working with another client, I asked if he would check the status of the work being done because it was not going on three hours. He continued to work with the other clients rather then do a quick check of my status to give my an update. After another 15 min I asked the cashier to speak to the manger to possibly get Chris some help since I felt he might be over extended with clients being that I got left on the back burner, at that time another employee over heard my request and said she would look into the status for me, Now my emotions were running high, I had more things to do then time allowed especially after being told loaner cars were not available nor provided for oil changes. After the three hours of waiting, my car was pulled up immediately just to find out I have to reschedule the two other issues I asked to be looked at, so all this time was wasted sitting around while my vehicle just sat there. This brought on tremendous stress as I was already dealing with the death my of uncle, sister in law and now my father. Had a loaner vehicle just been provided I could have left my car all day if need be but the way I was treated with no regard of my time was so disappointing, and to be pushed to the side so another customer could be help after waiting for three hours should not have happened.  That morning I sent an email explaining my disappointment to Eriek Griggers and Darrell Williams and never got a response from anyone. ",1.0
2,"April 16, 2020","These guys are all about the ""Sale"".  Customer service is bottom of the barrel, and the GM and his team are right out of a crappy movie with their one liners.   

Finance department is super high pressure and want to sell you everything under the sun.

3,"March 20, 2020","If I could leave a zero star review, I would.  We purchased a 2019 GLS-450  in December of 2018.  While Dutch, the salesman was fine, the dealer rating is dragged down by the absolute worst experience in finance department.  The Finance person, Tariq, was absolutely condescending and extremely high-pressure, especially when he found out we weren't going buy the ""Platinum"" package that ""every S-Class purchaser must have.""  

Fast forward to December 2019 and the introduction of the 2020 GLS-450 with second row Captain's Chairs and a touch screen infotainment display.  We made the decision to trade in our 2019 for the 2020 because it works better for our situation.

Because of the awful experience at Houston North, we drove out of our way to Mercedes of The Woodlands to trade-in and purchase the new GLS.  The difference in the process was amazing and I can see the difference in a locally-owned dealership and one owned by AutoNation.

Because we had purchased an extended warranty and prepaid maintenance for the 2019, we are due a 100% refund on these products as we never did use them.  Unfortunately Mercedes requires the selling dealership to process the paperwork.  

We have been trying for over a month to get this paperwork processed as Mercedes owes us quite a bit of money.  We have provided all of the necessary paperwork to process the refund.  All calls and emails to the Finance Manager, Frank Castenada, go unanswered.  The times I have gone to the dealership in person, there was ""no finance person available to assist you.""

I have also reached out to the Assistant General Manager as the General Manager, Ivan ""was not available.""  The AGM has not responded to us, either.  I am amazed that someone would do business in this manner.

What is required to process my refund??  C'mon AutoNation!",1.2

5,"February 07, 2020","A week ago, I finally received the notice that the Takata airbag replacement had arrived.  I have waited for years for this recall notice.  So, I immediately called for an appointment at this dealership.  I bought the car there.  I requested a loaner and the service operator said no problem.  The appointment was 5 days after the call.  Upon arrival, I met with my service representative and another representative who join in.  At that time, I was thinking why do I need two reps on a simple service.  The second rep tells me, ""if i want to wait the 3 hours"".  I said no, that I have a loaner scheduled and I need to be in Court.  I practice Law.   He tells me that he does not have any loaner available.   I was in utter disbelief.  My question, why, and what happened to the reservation for a Loaner?  He just repeated the same and that I can reschedule.  I just walked out.   On the way downtown Houston, I called the dealership and requested to speak with the service manager.  I was directed to his voice mail.  I left a message.  As of writing this, 24 hours later,  I have had no one reach out to me from the dealership.  I could understand that they could have overextended the loaners, but they could have called me before I my appointment.  The two service reps showed very little interest in helping me.
I left the dealership with the impression that this dealership did not want to deal with the recall.   Very poor service and customer relationship.",1.0

7,"April 16, 2019","It was bad enough that this ""certified pre-owned"" had to be in the shop from March 25, 2019 though April 15, 2019.  (It was just DELIVERED March 11, 2019).  However, this is not the subject of my complaint. 

I would like to know why my car was parked at the Toyota Center on Sunday April 7, 2019 at 6 PM?  Do you routinely let your customer's S class cars off the lot after-hours?  It was for a Rockets vs Suns game.  April 7, 2019, the car was SUPPOSED to be in your repair shop!!!!!!  (see attached)

Please have someone check some cameras and see which of your employees either did this or allowed this to happen?   The only good thing about this whole experience was my salesman JaJa and my service adviser Stephanie Cabrera.   I now understand why so many employees have left your dealership and fled to MBOTW!!!!  

I am very upset about this.  I would appreciate a response from management.  

UPDATE:  06/13/2020:  I have now fled to MBOTW and found where the BEST of the MB of Houston North employees have fled to also.  Two of my old MB North service advisors and one salesman is at MB of the Woodlands now.   I have bought 2 more cars from MBOTW since then!!!!",3.0
8,"February 20, 2019","Don’t even know where to start. Have had nightmarish experience with a 2014 ML350 and after having left us stranded for the 4th time service team asked us to speak with sales team to see if we could work out a deal on a more reliable vehicle. Said they would work with us, proceeded to waste 8 hours of our time. Frankly one of the most bizarre car shopping experiences I’ve ever had; made an offer on one vehicle, totally ignored it and came back trying to sell us a vehicle that cost $20k more and then sales mgr acted like I was being unreasonable. Salesman very good, sales manager simply a waste of time...

Only reason dealers like this survive is because they have a captive market area and unless you want to invest a lot of time traveling around to another dealer you’re stuck if you want their product. Fortunately, I no longer want their product and the Lexus buying experience is the opposite end of the spectrum. ",2.0

I cannot fathom how disappointed I am with the ""poor"" quality customer service I am getting after purchasing a brand new car!

I purchased my first brand new Mercedes the beginning of October and was not provided with a window sticker for my vehicle. I am aware that it is illegal to sell a brand new car without the window sticker.  Pete Pieternelle told me there was a way to order one was given an estimate time of delivery of 7-10 days from October 4th.  Every time I tried to follow up to check the status of my window sticker NO ONE will take or return my calls and voicemails.  Almost 2 months later I was finally informed that the order was refused and that I was NOT getting my window sticker.  This is how long this dealership will take to handle your simple matters!

I honestly thought this would be a SIMPLE request but this is becoming ridiculous. I am now aware of the Monroney Law and will move forward with legal actions. I do not recommend this dealership to anyone!

12,"October 24, 2017","Mercedes Benz North has to be one of the worst dealerships out of all of the Houston locations. From the time that my husband and I came in Nov 2013 to inquire about purchasing a vehicle from here we were treated bad. No one greeted us, asked if we needed any help, or anything. We actually had to find a salesman to assist us. I was interested in the CLA250 & wanted assistance with customizing one. The gentleman was very rude and hurriedly rushed through the process of how I would go about doing so. I placed the order for my vehicle and paid the money to have them to get started because I wanted the car February 2014 for my 30th birthday. We continuously called to check on the status of my order and were told that the vehicle was in production as of late December. By mid January we began to worry due to us not hearing from anyone. We decided to go in and speak with the gentleman that originally assisted us. He then informed us that there was no way we could get the vehicle by February. I was extremely disappointed but decided I would just purchase a new vehicle that was already there and included the features that I wanted. The gentleman there seemed extremely irritated, he was not helpful, and ultimately we left and ended up purchasing our vehicle from the Mercedes Benz Sugarland location (30 miles away). Fast forward to present day every time that I've needed service I've taken my vehicle into either Mercedes Benz North or the Woodlands location. The 2 locations are like night and day. The Woodlands provides exceptional service but the North location is kind of hit or miss. My last straw that caused me to write this long drawn out review was my most recent experience Oct 2017. I took my vehicle in to be checked out due to a few issues I was having and was assigned a sweet and amazingly helpful representative (Natalie) she was very informative and went out of her way to communicate with me concerning my service needs. After she sent over an estimate I talked things over with my husband and he was able to find service through another company for a much cheaper rate. So I called in to inform them that I would not like to get my repairs done thru them I would like to pick up my vehicle. Well unfortunately Natalie was not in. So I had to speak with someone else. The gentleman was very pushy and persistent about me getting the repairs done there even after I declined several times. He even made me hang up and attempt to call my husband to find out which estimates he had for the other repair shop (mind you my husband was at work) I called back to tell him that I could not reach him and that I wanted to come get my vehicle. He then became rude and told me that if I was coming soon it was not going to receive the complimentary wash that is normally done when bringing your car in for service. I told boo I would wait to have it done and he hung up. When I got there an hour later my car was filthy. The guy said it was because they parked it under a tree. Also I had no help with switching from the loaner to my vehicle. *I had my 6 month old with me and my 76yr old grandmother* There were 4 gentleman standing there watching me as I struggled to carry the car seat, base, stroller, diaper bag, my purse and assist my grandmother with getting to the other vehicle. The guy sprayed some type of car cleaner on a towel and attempted to wipe off the thick black dirt off of my white car. I then asked could it possibly be at least just rinsed off. He hurriedly took it to be done and came back with the car as if I irritated him by asking for that to be done. I said all of that to say this. They have made my experience absolutely horrible. I'm tempted to trade my car in and go with another make and model. My husband drives a BMW & he has never been treated this way. I would advise anyone not to ever purchase or receive services from this location. They are seemingly uncaring, unhelpful, inconsiderate and somewhat seemingly prejudice. And it's a shame that with the fine merchandise they are trusted to sale and provide service for they don't feel the need to do better and be better. ",1.0
13,"May 04, 2017","My car was supposed to have the navigation Becker map box in the glove box and a windscreen for when the top is down, all of which were present when i test drove the car. Good thing I looked in the glove box and told them that I wasn't taking the car until the Becker map box was found.  The windscreen was gone and I was told that I would get a new one ordered for me and mailed to my house. Two weeks later and no windscreen sent to my house, I called and my salesperson told me that his manager would not order it or that it would come out of his commissions. Are you kidding me? Nope, they were serious! The windscreen is listed on the car inventory AND was in the car when I test drove it. It isn't my fault that multiple things have been stolen from that location. They should have given me the windscreen. Then I over paid for T,T & L, sent me a check LATE and was not able to cash it and will not return phone calls to have a replacement mailed out.  GO ELSEWHERE for your car purchase! ",2.0
14,"May 02, 2017","I run a small business and have never given my time to leave a review. That said, this experience is being chronicled for information and guidance to anyone considering buying a new  Mercedes-Benz . For me, this experience has removed Mercedes-Benz from any future purchase consideration.

In the first week of February 2017 I paid MB Houston North $1000 to hold a GLS450  that was to be delivered to their location within a few days. After calling the salesman numerous times over the next week he finally told me that someone else had also put money down so I would have to wait until the next one came in. A lengthy run around concerning that models availability lead us to a decision to order a new GLS from the factory so it could be made exactly to my tastes and it would be delivered the first week of March. I would finance through my bank and there would be no trade in. No problem.

The second week of March, after numerous unanswered calls and voice messages left, the salesman informed me that production for my vehicle was delayed by the factory and it would be two more weeks before delivery. These same events repeated until MB finally made the vehicle available at the end of April (a full three months after my $1000 deposit was made).

When the vehicle finally arrived, April 28th, I went in to sign papers and take delivery only to be ambushed by the finance team telling me that I had to finance through MB or show my personal bank statements for the past three months proving that I had more than 85k sitting in my account or they would cancel the deal. I informed them that my business account carries a balance well over this never before mentioned requirement; however, as my personal monies are invested in multiple finance vehicles my personal bank account wouldn't show that amount until I moved monies into it which I would be happy to do. MB Houston North then told me that I had no choice but to finance through them or they would cancel the deal.

Three months of time wasted with unresponsive and misleading communication and because my money is working for me and my business and not simply sitting stagnant in a low return personal bank account I'm being forced to use their financing which would be a minimum of two points higher than my bank … I think not. 

Even if MB can circumvent the illegal practice of forcing you to use their financing this entire experience was, at best, unethical.  I now have zero confidence in Mercedes-Benz and their dealership at Houston North.",1.4
15,"January 26, 2017",My c250 started missing and would not accelerate. We were 100 miles from Houston  and somehow got it to MB  North. Tracy was my advisor and processed us immediately. I was given a new c300 for a loaner. The attendants transferred our luggage and we went home. They swapped coils which fixed the problem but wanted to keep the car another day to make sure it was fixed. Tracy called and said the car could be picked up. I went to the dealership and had to wait two minutes because they wanted to change my key fob battery. No charges.,5.0

17,"November 30, 2016","My experience with both service personnel, primarily Tracey (sp?) during my last visit, and the quality of work product produced by the maintenance personnel has been exemplary.

Mercedes Benz seems to have a superb operation all around the Houston metropolitan area.

Here is my story about purchasing my car not even 2 years ago. I would like to share my experience. Thank you,

Below is the brief version:

Beware of Mercedes of North Houston - Biocides in their automobiles!!!

These are highlights of what has happened at Mercedes of North Houston, and Mercedes Corporate. This is how we were treated after my family has purchased over five cars from Mercedes in the last several years.

2014 Mercedes GL 450 purchased almost two years ago for $80,000.00.
Since then, ongoing problems with the car include warped rotors, broken strut and shock, air conditioning not working properly, leak in the engine coolant system, and a leak in the engine itself which took six weeks to fix.
Largest problem - Odor being emitted from the car that cannot be fixed. One of service managers, Jason informed me that he traveled to Germany to discuss the problems with the odor in these automobiles. They had two ways to potentially try and reduce the odor, but could not eliminate it. I was told by service management that a Biocide was injected into the air conditioning system to try and reduce engine mold. When the Biocide cures, this odor is emitted (This could take up to a year). ***Note: Biocides can cause asthma and breathing difficulties!!!
An excerpt from EPA:
Also, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) does not “approve” biocides for mould remediation applications and cautions against using disinfectants and sanitizers in ventilation systems.
About 6-8 months after I purchased the car, I began having breathing difficulties. I saw several physicians including internists, hematologists, oncologists, pulmonologists, etc. I even went to Mayo Clinic (one of the top hospitals in the country). I spent about a year dragging around an Oxygen tank, yet none of the doctors could attribute my breathing difficulty to anything related to my body. Nobody could explain why my Oxygen had dropped to 85%.
Mercedes called us in for a meeting. My husband and I went and met with Pete (sales manager) at Mercedes of North Houston. Not five minutes after we sat down to discuss the situation, he told us that he has 20 sales people on the floor, and doesn’t have time to sit and discuss this with us.
After relaying all the information to Mercedes, and Mercedes Corporate, they told us they would be willing to give us $40,000 as a trade for my automobile, and $9,500 toward the purchase of a new car ($3,000 from corporate, and $6,500 from Mercedes of North Houston). How insulting considering I spent $80,000 on the car, and a tremendous amount of money on medical bills this past year and a half.
These are highlights of what has happened at Mercedes of North Houston, and Mercedes Corporate. This is how we are treated after my family has purchased over five cars from Mercedes in the last several years.

21,"August 09, 2016","Since you have a limited amount of time I will simply summarize my experience in the first two paragraph. 

   My wife's vehicle (2013 ML 350 4 MATIC) was rear ended and the repairs were completed by a shop that was recommended by the insurance company. I was disputing the amount of damage my vehicle sustained. The adjuster and I were clearly disagreeing so I needed the service department at MB to confirm that the vehicle was malfunctioning due to the wreck (or simply tell me it was normal wear and tear). I needed the mechanics to look over my vehicle and its previous repair and maintenance records to confirm my suspensions . Not only did they not do what I asked them to do but they also did not provide me with the paper work that I needed to give to the insurance company represenative. When I arrived to pick up my vehicle I noticed that not only did they not have the paper work I requested but the maintence advisor could not be bothered to come out and brief me on what was done and why. At this point I was so frustrated and rushed for time I decided I would just call Managment to explain what my concerns were and how they could have been addressed to ensure I would be a repeat client. The service manager was more concerned with defending the service advisors actions then address the actual problems. At this point I fully understood all the negative review and why so many people were so passionate about their issues with this dealership. 
     Chances are if you are reading this there is no way you will use this location for your MB needs because unlike me you did your homework first. 


The full review below; complete with names and actions described in more detail. 

I did not purchase a vehicle at this location however since I purchased my vehicle in anther state I used them for the maintenance on my ML 350. Let me start of by saying there are positives to my experience here for example when I turned my vehicle in they were ready and waiting for me and they even provided me with a loaner free of charge. Nothing else about my experience with their service department was positive. 
        I will walk you through what happened to me when I went there for a simple service of my vehicle. I went up there on a Thursday and spoke with the receptionist that sits in the back left hand side of the building she was very and even called a service advisor over to hear what I wanted to have done to my vehicle. I explained to Mr. Davis, Steven that I was rear-ended by a truck that was going about 45 miles a hour and I had just got my vehicle back from the shop. I explained to Mr. Davis that I noticed that they had not repaired all the damage to my vehicle. I then explained to him that I would like for them to look at the mechanics of the vehicle and any body damage that would be considered mechanical and let me know if anything else was damaged and not repaired. I thought this was fairly straight forward since I had only purchased the vehicle about five months ago and I know that the dealership where I purchased my vehicle kept really good records. After I explained all that to him he scheduled me an appointment on the very next Tuesday.
         I arrived about 10 minutes early and waited in line for about 10 minutes at which point Mr. Davis came outside and had me reexplain what my issues were (this I am sure is normal since they deal with so much traffic) which I did in detail. I made sure he understood this was due to me being rear ended so he would know what to look for. He started off by making sure the specific items (for example; exterior gas take door) I was complaining about were malfunctioning. I was confused by this because I did not think anyone would make this up since it cost money to have your vehicle repaired. Then he said something that caught me of guard after I told him the electronics in my vehicle at random intervals  were acting funny when switching between tasks he responded by saying ""Well if they don't malfunction while I am inspecting it there is nothing I can do."" I could not believe he was essentially refusing to repair it just based on what I was telling him. Most shops will fix things sometimes just so they can charge you. Since The damage was due to the accident I would not be paying for it I was not concerned. 
       After about two days I called and asked about my vehicle they told me I could pick it up later that day so I hung up and waited to hear back from then which I never did. So I went up there the next day and found out my vehicle was ready (thank goodness) for pick up. When I went to pay the bill I found out that my vehicle was still under warranty and I did not have to pay for the items that they ended up repairing. Now it made sense why he was giving me reasons not to fix the items I was concerned about. Now I did not approve the repairs they made to my vehicle and normally I would be happy about this but since it was due to a accident I did not want them to repair it until I spoke with the Ghieco. I wanted Gheico to see items malfunctioning so they could do their own inspection of they were so inclined to. 
      I had also requested the dealerships inspection paper work for my vehicle when they received it so I could prove to Gheico that my vehicle was in perfect condition prior to the accident. I was not provided this paper work they did not explain any of the repairs on the vehicle on my invoice and Mr. Davis did not come out to explain to me what had been done to the vehicle and if it was in fact due to the accident. This tells me that he did not listen to what I asked him to do or even bother to pretend like he had listened to my very specific request. Mr. Davis made no effort to provide me with the information and documentation that I really needed for the accident. 

    Look if I owned a Honda or a Toyota I would be completely fine with this type of behavior from the service department staff but the fact is that when you own a vehicle that cost around $60,000.00 you expect a different level of care and service. At the end of the day I am willing to pay that for the vehicle not because I think the vehicle it self is worth that amount of money but because the service you receive after your purchase is worth it. Prime example MB offers a concierge and emergency service button in the vehicle and it is for this exact reason that people pay an additional fee every year to have those services active and available.

25,"May 03, 2016","Hello I purchased a vehicle on March 15th 2016. This purchase was made at the Mercedes-Benz of Houston North located 17510 North Freeway
Houston, TX 77090. The vehicle was given to me with 40k. I was told that the car was under the 50K factor warranty. The next morning on March 16th I notice that the backlight on the car was blinking. Stephanie called me at 11am the same day and I also reported the issue to her as well. She did advise for me to come in that day for service to take a look. I did let her know that I made an appointment with Infiniti since they are the manufactures. She said that was fine but update her as I go along. I arrived at my appointment with Infiniti on March 19th at 9am. Ashley from services advised that I no longer had a factory warranty and that the warranty expired on October of 2015. In that case infinity wasn’t able to help me on my issue. Immediately emailed Stephanie with this email:
She called me around noon (same date) to let me know that service is refusing to look at my car and she will bring it up to management Monday. She also noted that she will contact me Monday for an update on if service could look into my issue.
I received a call from Eriek Griggers on Monday March 21 and received an email asking about the detail of the issue. My service request included the following: The original request was to have the entire car inspected.

*seeking a full inspection regarding the brakes, tires, fuel etc. 
*When accelerating, the car Also chokes up a bit
*clock light blinking when the car illuminates in dark places
Eriek Griggers advised for me to come in to drop off and I did as he requested.
I dropped my car to the Mercedes-Benz of Houston North dealership on Tuesday March 22nd. I received a call from Ashley from Infiniti on Thursday March 24th and she advised that the car was in their possession. She mentioned that she couldn’t validate my warranty due to Mercedes Benz\ AutoNation not completing my paperwork. She mentioned that I should have an answer soon. I received a call from Stephanie Costillo on Friday and she mentioned that my car was not covered under warranty and that I would need to pick up my car.  She also implied that all of my other issue were resolved except the backlight issue. I advised that my only issue was the back light. The issue was reported the next day which should have been resolved with no question.

 Dashley from Mercedes Benz called at 3/28 today and she mentioned that this issue is covered under the Auto Nation factory warranty however they refuse to fix or pay because it is not a Mercedes Benz certified Vehicle.
STATEMENT FROM ASHLEY IN SERVICE Dashley Williams Internal Service AdvisorMercedes-Benz of Houston North
Also, the warranty you were asking about is an Autonation 60 day warranty starting the day you purchased the vehicle… we tried everything we could to get them to cover the issue but unfortunately they would not. 
While in the frustration of trying to receive help. My family and I have relocated to Alpharetta Ga.
 2 days after receiving the car back, I received a check engine light as well as other services. This tell me that the request given to Eriek was not performed even though they were all aware that I was in the process of driving 900 miles out of state. Unfortunately I was forced to rent a car to drive 900 miles due to the dealership being closed.
Due to the possible electric issue, I am in fear of my life as well as my family. We have ruled out that this issue isn’t a small fuse but could be bigger and dangerous. Service to remedy this issue was denied even though 2 warranties could fix this issue. This company has committed fraud in pushing a car Purchase with issues and promised that the factory warranty was in place. I do have the paperwork from Service that falsely stated that this car was under factory warranty.

I was also denied to return the car because there’s a 2 day warranty even though the issue was reported 15 hours later
This process has been frustrating and all I desired was commitment from all parties. I was sold into a car with false advertisement from the seller as well as the finance department. I mentioned continuously that I wanted a car under the factory warranty based on my constant traveling in the future. Both department promise that everything was covered under the factory warranty.

I have currently created reviews under all Mercedes Benz and AutoNation regarding this issue for immediate help and to spread the awareness as well seek help in resolving this.
I have consulted with a lawyer and I was requested to plead with the company for the appropriate customer service. I will send this information as much as possible to receive a response. My request is to gain support in fixing this issue. Please respond before 5/13 for the next step in resolving this issue and legal action will not be taken. I am requesting compensation to fix the clock and or whatever service needed to resolve this issue. I would also like to know what can be done to satisfy the false advertisement regarding the Factory Warranty. I’m not sure of what could be done but I am open minded to see what justifications could be made.

29,"May 06, 2015","I purchased a vehicle from them and same evening I took it home I realized it had rock chips in 2 prominent locations. Their service technicians broke the rear plate bracket when they were installing the temporary plates. I spoke to the salesman (Manuel) who looked into the issue and promised to take care of it. I advised them that part of my review will include this information and they asked me not to post anything negative as they will take care of it. They got a quote from a windshield replacement company and was advised they will be calling me anytime to schedule time to go in and have it replaced. After a few days, the salesman called me in the morning to see if I had received a call / scheduled the replacement. A few hours later, he came back and informed me that his sales manager had refused to authorize this expense to make good on their word. I believe the sales guy tried his best to make the situation right, his management over-ruled him. I communicated in writing to their top management in detail about this and so this should not come as a surprise to them. I am mentioning this as I expect the standard ""call us so we can see what we can do"" response they seem to give to most complaints.

31,"October 21, 2014","""Neal Richard"" is by far the worst car salesman I have ever seen in my life. Car salesmen should take pride in their work, be courteous to customers, be humble and most importantly customer service and satisfaction should be their prime focus.
For a simple issue with the car, I had to remind this guy to respond every time by email or phone. He never calls back and responds. Complaining to his bosses ""Frank Reed"" and ""Kolby Wahl"" had no effect whatsoever, which implies what runs in the DNA of this dealership. I has been over few months now and I have not been able to resolve the issue with my car yet with these folks. I repent buying my CPO from this dealership.

Dealing with Mercedes dealership at Austin and ParkPlace (Dallas) was so much better.

32,"April 21, 2014","Be careful when purchasing a Certified Pre-owned vehicle (CPO) vehicle from this dealership. 

Mercedes North Houston sold me a CPO E350 that I later found had been in a single vehicle front in accident (ran into fire hydrant)causing $22,000 in damages (never reported to CarFax).  The CPO report they provided me at the time of sale was for the wrong vehicle.  I didnt catch the mistake at the dealeand and it took them months to produce the correct one.  I had my own third party appraisal conducted which truly revealed the extent of the damage.  Just a few of the items include significant damage and sub-standard repair to the front bumper, hood, head lamps, bumper impact bar, crumple zones, and it was poorly re-painted throughout the vehicle with orange peel texture).  The day of purchase it was raining making the visible walk around difficult at best.  I have multiple expert opinions advising there was no way this vehicle could have passed the Mercedes Benz CPO inspection.    
     
After personally researching my E-350 vehicles history more extensively I found the following information (names, dates, etc. have been omitted): 

* The first owner leased the vehicle from a dealership in San Jose, CA.  During the lease period the vehicle was involved in a single vehicle front end collision when it ran off road through several trees and landscaping ultimately impacting a fire hydrant (AutoCheck provided the case number).  

* The vehicle suffered $22,000.00 in damages (I personally verified this with the insurance carrier).  The vehicle repaired was returned to the original Mercedes Benz dealership in San Jose, CA where it received a post lease inspection (I called and verified that too).  

* Mercedes Benz Financial Service took transfer of the vehicle and it was delivered to Mercedes Benz North Houston where they inspected and passed the vehicle as a Certified Pre-owned then listed it for sale.

* I purchased the CPO E350 a few weeks later at high retail value with the impression I was getting a great car.  Mercedes had conducted TWO inspections on the vehicle, one being the CPO, none of which indicated any prior damage or issues.  I was completely uninformed of the structural damage, visible repairs, and total repaint to vehicle had received.

When I advised Mercedes North Houston the sales associate advised me this was no big deal, the vehicle had received a CPO inspection, and that a certain amount of damage was acceptable without requiring a disclosure.  He later told me if something had been missed during the inspection Mercedes Benz North Houston was not at fault since AutoNation had conducted the CPO inspection.  Now keep in mind that Auto Nation owns Mercedes North Houston as well as their onsite service and repair facility.  This guy was ABSOLUTELY WORTHLESS.  It would be interesteing to find out how many other times they've sold a previously wrecked vehicle as a CPO to unknowing customers.  

I've made repeated attempts to remedy this situation but now Mercedes North Houston refuses to contact me.  Unfortunately third parties have had to get involved.  

To sum this up.... Mercedes Houston North has no brand standards for their CPO vehicles, no sales ethics, and have proven to be a classless organization.  I will never purchase another Mercedes Benz due to this experience.

33,"February 10, 2014","I always thought a Mercedes-Benz dealership would have an air of attitude and snobbery.
But after contacting Joshua Trenary in advance of my visit, I could tell from his email that the experience was not going to be as expected.  I made an appointment with him and actually showed up early to find he was ready and willing to help me.  We test drove 2 cars and he answered all of my questions, no matter how stupid I felt they were.  He was very knowledgeable about the whole process, even financing.  At other dealerships I have spent hours going back and forth and hearing the sales person talk about “their manager”.  I think from the time I walked into the door until Joshua showed me the final numbers in writing was about 1.5 hours.  The Finance manager Donald Cyprian was just as friendly and efficient.  He made sure I understood the finance options and was also good about answering all my questions. The next business day he even re-ran all of my paperwork because of a change i requested.
I highly recommend Mercedes-Benz North Houston and suggest you ask for Joshua on the sales side and Donald on the finance side.

I did not receive a call nor email to cancel. We drove two cars that afternoon with Mr. Netters. He was extremely courteous. Very good experience with Mr. Netters. We went back on Saturday and was passed back off the Mr. Jeanes. We drove one car. He then preceeded to tell use we had reached our limit on test driving their cars. We left!! I gave Mr. Netters one more shot on Monday to sell me a car. He pulled out the new invoice of the used car I was looking at. They came down 3500 from new invoice. WOW!! They tried to charge me 800 dollars for the CPO warrenty. Incrediable!! After a trip to his manager, they came down to the internet price. I told him they could do better than that. He said, ""If you don't pay sticker, someone else will"". I left and and headed to Holmes European in Shreveport Louisiansa. They were AWESOME!!!

36,"November 18, 2013","Went to purchase a certified pre owned Mercedes from them and I didn't even haggle on the price they had on their website. I test drove the vehicle and said fine and wanted to proceed to purchase. Now if y'all don't know, when you purchase a certified per owned vehicle from the dealer, it comes with an extended warranty of 1 year and 100,000 miles beyond the manufactures warranty. When we went to do the paperwork, they tried to charge me an extra $750 for the certified per owned warranty!? I said what the heck was this? They said they were selling the car at a lost already so they had to charge the extra $750 for the warranty even though on their website, the price they had was included?!? Wtf! I told him no way out of principle and $750 extra was not that much in relevance to the price of the Mercedes but I wasn't going to pay it. He told me the managers wouldn't budge so I walked. 

How the heck do you advertise on your website a price for a car and then try to charge extra when you go try to buy it for that exact price? Once again, I was willing to buy the car at advertised price and no haggling.

Update. 
Talked to Mercedes sugar land and greenway and both of those dealership  comes with the  extended warranty  for their certified pre owned but north location does not. Very deceptive of Mercedes north Houston! ",2.0

I live a state away (the RHD vehicles are hard to find) and so had to conduct business over the phone.

They ran my credit, told me everything was good and that they would be getting back to me about shipping details.

To my dismay, that evening I receive a text message (of all things) informing me that the jeep had been sold without the salesperson that I had been working with's knowledge.

I consider that selling a vehicle after running a person's credit, while everything was looking good for the transaction to move forward, is a pretty big breach of trust and was incredibly disappointing in my situation.

From there I also met his sales manager who helped make the deal on the truck too good to turn down. This good feeling was carried all the way through the financing department and when I walked put of the dealership I had absolutely no regrets and no feeling of being pressured. Even though I don't live in Texas, they assured me that the would ship it up to me by a professional carrier and it would be as good as I remember it. It took a little over a week to ship it up to North Dakota but it was well worth it. The transporter driver, although a bit tired, was as great as the staff at Mercedes-Benz of Houston North.

Initially the contact/communication was handled appropriately, however after speaking with Mr. Wahl, the used car sales manager, and being told a price, things changed. I was told a quote would be sent to my home e-mail, and it was there when I arrived home, but the quote did not reflect what we had discussed. It was $95 higher, and several fees were added that were not discussed. I live in Alaska and planned to fly down with my wife and drive the car home. This was clear from the beginning. The fees added were Texas registration, license, sales tax, inspection, and dealer document fee. I replied to Mr. Wahl's e-mail letting him know that I would take care of license, registration, and insurance. Alaska does not have sales tax or inspection fees. There was no response to that e-mail; however I was called two days later by Mr. Thompson to ask if I was still interested in the car. I told him I was, mentioned the message to Mr. Wahl, and asked if that had been reviewed. I was told those fees were required because I was financing the car through Mercedes-Benz and the requirements were different than those of Texas or Alaska. I contacted Alaska DMV, Texas DMV, and Mercedes financial. When I learned the only fees necessary where those to satisfy Alaska and the negotiated dealer document fees I called the dealership and asked to speak to a sales manager. The first call went directly to voice mail; I did not leave a message, but called back and left a message with the receptionist asking for a call back as soon as possible. Two days passed with no response. I bought a car in Reno the next day in less than three hours, spent a little more money, and was given the level of service hoped for from a Mercedes dealership.

73,"July 29, 2011","I'm a 40 something financial professional who has bought my share of new and used cars.  Here is my complete account of my experience with Mercedes Benz North.

The only reason I visited this dealership was that they had a used Acura I had seen on the internet.  I'm fairly knowledgeable about cars and generally prefer to buy a used car from an individual since I've not found many car salesmen who I would truly consider professional and dealer cars are quite often way overpriced.  I came in and was warmly greeted by Alex.  

I told him I wanted to see the Acura and he said that it had just come in on trade and hadn't been cleaned or prepped.  He suggested we come back the next day and he'd have the Acura cleaned and cleared to test drive.  He asked if I'd considered a used MB and I said I had not.  He said he wanted to show me a recent E class trade that was in the same price range.  I had my wife with me and we agreed to go for a test drive.  Alex was highly professional and knowledgeable about the MB and frankly, we were impressed with the condition and ride of the car.  My wife and I seriously considered the MB and came in the next day to drive the Acura.  The car was highly detailed and clean all over.  He'd had two tires replaced, the car checked out and he'd ordered a lens for a broken light cover.  

I drove the car and finally decided on the Acura, although the MB was very nice but a little bigger than I needed. I told Alex I wanted to have the Acura inspected by a 3rd party mechanic and he said I could, but I really didn't need to since MB North had gone through the car.  even so, I arranged to have the Acura inspected by the local Acura dealer.  Alex then offered to take the car over there and bring it back for me so I didn't have to leave work.  I paid (by phone) for Acura to do their 150 Point Inspection that they do on the Acura Certified Cars and (Alex was right..)it came back with a perfect score.   

I went back again to see the car and asked about a scratch in the rear bumper, Alex said no problem and then arranged to have the paint shop touch it up and they did an incredible job.  I negotiated what I thought was within the fair price range for the car and agreed to purchase.   I've had the car for almost two weeks and am totally happy with the vehicle.  Alex even called me to follow up and make sure everything was going well with the car.  

Had I bought the same car from an individual I may have saved a few hundred dollars on price, but I would have spent many hours and lots more money trying to take care of all the things that Alex did to make my my car perfect and my purchase a smooth transaction.  And that, to me, is what a professional dealer is supposed to do.  

Alex is from the old school of customer service.  He'll give you his honest opinion then he will listen to what you want to do and he'll go make it happen.  I wish I could get this kind of attention and service every where else I spend my hard earned money...

Bottom line; Alex is a straight shooter who is easy to work with and knows what he's talking about.  If you have a reasonable request, he'll make it happen. 

Thank you Alex & MB North!",5.0

The dealership knows about the missing component and still advertised as equipped. False advertisement.

They basically refused to budge off of the list price. I tried again to offer a higher price and they would not budge. They informed me that someone else was ready to buy the car for list price so I left. Recieved a call later stating that the deal fell through so I ask them about the price.

I will never do business with Mercedes North and will advise all friends/family to stay away from this corrupt dealership. I have to say I expected more from a Mercedes dealership.

93,"December 28, 2009","Came from out of town to purchase a new E-Class Coupe because of this dealer's willingness to make a good deal.  Because of what I wanted, we had to order the car from Germany and it arrived in about 2 months time.  We did the deal over the phone and email.  They helped me work through getting a USAA discount.  They very clearly spelled out the invoice price on the car, the MSRP and the price they wanted for the car, which was in line with what my internet research indicated.  They were willing to trade my 10 year old vehicle and agreed to a price site unseen to them that was in line with a trade-in value indicated by Kelly Blue Book and Edmunds.  On arrival at the dealership, everything was ready to go.  No change or haggling on the agreed price; they looked at my trade-in and gave me the agreed to price.  They found a lender in Houston that matched a lender that I had lined up in my home town, so I am going with their lender.  The paper signing was all computerized and easy to go with.  The vehicle checkout went well and gave a good overview of the vehicle's features.  This was probably the easiest car buying experience that I have had.  I felt good coming out of the dealer because everything was pre-agreed to so I didn't have to wonder after I left if I had made some mistake in the deal.

I told him that I would be traveling from out of town to purchase the vehicle so I was coming to pick up the car and I didn't want to waste my time. I took a day off work and notified him that I would be coming to fill out paper work and purchase the vehicle on the terms we had agreed on. When I arrived, we discussed pricing a little more for a while and was in the process of further negotiating. He indicated that the agreed upon price was the best he could offer and that he could not go any lower. We calculated tax, title and license costs to figure the total drive out figures. After I agreed, I asked him to print out the paperwork because I was ready to purchase and I didn't want to deal with any other hassles. The salesman then proceeded to type in a few calculations in his calculator and then told me ""This is the best we can offer you (a price that was WELL ABOVE what we had just discussed only seconds ago and for the last few days). I literally thought he was joking because it sounded so ridiculous. I questioned him about the previous quote he had given me and he told me ""Oh, I never said I agreed to it..."" The situation was completely ridiculous and laughable. I got up and left the dealership. He wasted my time and my entire day.

95,"June 28, 2008","This story should stop anyone from  ever purchasing anything from this dealership, EVER!! 

I bought a Used car from what I thought was a reputable dealer.  I actually had a car almost bought from a private seller for $700 less, the exact model, same mileage, same color, same options but felt I would have a better experience buying from what I thought was an established, reputable dealer!!  I could not have been more wrong.  

When I test drove the car, dash lights for the ABS and Traction Control systems were on.  The salesman assured me that he would have it repaired at the Porsche dealership so I made the deal hinging on them having this issue corrected.  When I picked up the car later that day, the lights were off, but to my great disappointment, later that night the lights came on again so it was back to Mercedes the next morning to have them repaired.  They kept my car 2 days and then advised me that I would need to make an appointment at the Porcshe dealer next week and they would take care of it.  Not the way I would have liked for it ot be handled but we went ahead and made the appointment for the next week.  My car was at Porsche for 4-5 days before the problem was diagnosed with very little feedback from Mercedes unless I prompted them. Here comes the good part, the repair was quoted as costing ~$4700 so Mercedes flat out refused to pay it and then went on to suggest that I buy an extended warranty and they would throw in $1000.  So now they wanted to me to buy the warranty, knowing this pre-existing issue was there, wait 30 days and file a claim!! High integrity sales staff!!  Naturally, I refused to do so and told them I wanted my car repaired or my money back.  

This took another 2 weeks to resolve with again much prompting and ultimatums on our part and very little effort on theirs. It took about 2 more weeks to repair it and now there has been another problem found with the dash.  This was discovered 10 days ago with still no repair completed.  Every day, when I call them, they say it could be ready tomorrow when the Porsche dealership has informed me that the dash part will take 10-14 days to deliver.  Again, no effort on their part to keep me informed, or tell me the truth.  I have never been involved with a more unethical group of people in my life.  I hold a senior leadership position with a Fortune 500 company and if I ever treated my coworkers, clients or contractors in this fashion, I would be fired!! 

Last straw was my husband and I visiting the dealership on June 27th to demand on money back.  Well, the lies continued, the Used Car Manager would not come out of his office to speak with us and the General Manager would not return our phone calls.  The most frustrating part of this whole mess is the arrogant manner in which the Mercededs staff has been in communications.  They act like they are doing me a favor in providing me the car I agreed to purchase 10 weeks ago!! Coupled with the lack of management involvement and the inability to return a call or address something head on has caused this to us now pursue legal action against the dealership.

Please don't patronize this dealership.    ",1.0
96,"September 29, 2005","The service took three visits to complete because of parts for this car not being in stock or even in the country. This is unacceptable.  This is for an SLK55AMG.

1. I took car in for Service A and a leak in the trunk (among other things). The leak was not fixed because the entire rear window had to be replaced to fix this problem. The window/weather-stripping assembly had to be sent from Germany. I was promised the parts would be there in three days. I picked up the car after the three days without the arrival of the part. When I did pick up the car, it was sitting in an UNCOVERED parking place in the rain. I don’t think a car with a water leak in the trunk should have been parked in uncovered parking, especially when it had been raining torrents every day for a week.

2. Finally I was notified that the window had arrived and I took the car in for that. At that time, another water leak had developed with the driver side window weather-stripping. I was told that the weather-stripping was unavailable and it, too, had to be thrown into the Atlantic ocean for its trek across. I picked up the car the same day and noticed they had not replaced the window tint that was on the original window. Since I had to come back for the window weather-stripping replacement, I told them they could do it at that time. I was told that the weather-stripping for the driver’s window would be there in a couple of days.

3. After close to three weeks of waiting, I finally called the service advisor and told him that I was glad that I hadn’t left my car there all this time waiting for the parts to arrive. Driving the wimpy C230 for that length of time would have driven me crazy, by the way. Fortunately rentals are ""free"".  He informed me that he told someone to call me and that the parts had been there for some time. No one called me.

4. All this originated from the Service A. Remember, I had been there three separate times. I figured that when all was completed and closed out that I would have received the invoice for the original Service A. That did not happen either. I actually thought (well, hoped, anyway) that the $183 charge for the Service A had been “comped” because of the way things had been handled (all the waiting for parts, etc.), but that was not the case. Several days later the cashier called and wanted payment for which I provided my credit card.

I had big problems with the service advisors, they usually dont care about you and have very little information aside from the time of the day.

Stand up guy that does not BS you nor does he avoid your pointed questions.  I have known him 12 years and he has truly worked his way up from the shop to the advisor desk to now the manager.

I shopped the other three MB dealerships and Northside Lexus and returned to Mercedes Benz of Houston-North because of your product and your sales person.xxxxxx did a good job of selling me the product.  He was polished, introduced himself, asked my name, demonstrated the car and asked for the sale.  Not one other sales person at the other Mercedes Benz dealerships did the same.  When I asked questions about the car he gave me straight answers.  After my Wife and I agreed to purchase the car is when your dealership began to fail me as a first class organization that one would expect when carrying the flagship name Mercedes Benz.When we did the paper work with the lady in back, she insisted that we had to fill out a credit application to buy the car.  We brought an approval letter from our credit union and we weren’t taking the car home that night. In a society with identity theft as a growing problem and the invasion of privacy that can happen in the wrong hands of someone with a social security number, I wasn’t comfortable giving out my social security number for a credit check when not using your financial institution. According to my credit union, someone from your dealership could have picked up a certified check the very next day (and I wasn’t taking the car home that night). In my business certified funds are good enough for my customers to close on a half-million dollar home but I guess at your dealership they aren’t good enough for a fifty thousand dollar car. Subsequently, we took the car home three days later.Ten days after I purchased the car, I brought it to your dealership for an alignment and the right rear window wouldn’t go down all the way.  Items that I believe the Starkmark certification should have found but it was no big deal to me. I dropped the car off on Wednesday, October 22 and the car wasn’t ready until Monday, October 27 in the evening.This is where the arrogance of your dealership pissed me off.  When I was told to come pick up the car, I was told that the rear widow wasn’t fixed.  When I asked why, I was told “We don’t want to pay for it and your Starmark warranty won’t go into effect for another 30-45 days.”  They wanted me to bring the car back at a later date to fix an item that should have been done before we purchased the car.  What’s the purpose of buying a Starmark car if the inspection hasn’t been fully done and there’s a waiting period for it to take effect.  I hope my engine or transmission doesn’t quit because I purchased a Starmark car from Mercedes Benz of Houston-North and they don’t stand behind their product and they sure don’t want to make the customer happy.  In addition, it takes four working days to align a car that most places can do in a couple of hours. ",2.0
