0,"June 10, 2020","The management of this dealership does not care about the health of its employees or customers.  I went in to the service department merely to have my hybrid and auxiliary batteries tested.  I got out of my car and looked around at all the service techs coming and going.  Not a one had on a mask!  I spoke about this to a manager and he was not wearing a mask.  In the service department office there was no social distancing whatever.  People were passing each other up close and within their personal spaces.  Every customer I saw come in was wearing a mask.  Apparently the customers care more about themselves, their families, and the employees of Bryan College Station Toyota than the employees and management care about us.

I was livid!  Because of this, I could not enter the building to wait in an air-conditioned space.  I called the general manager the next day and he claimed that he could not force his employees to wear a mask, even though this ensures the safety of the customers.  The number of positive Covid-9 cases are on the rise in Brazos County and in the state of Texas.  He went on to claim that some customers complained about dealing with a masked tech.  The way to handle that is to inform them that it was for THEIR protection, as well as the protection of the employee and his family at home, that masks are mandated.  What a wimp of a manager!

I stand by my rating and my assessment of the deplorable conditions a customer is forced to endure by dropping into this dealership.  I feel that if I can save even one life by this review and rating (I would give it a minus-10 if I could), it is worth my time to post it.",1.0
1,"April 15, 2020",Keith was perfect in handling the purchase of our new Tundra. We drove from Houston to Bryan after Keith found exactly what were looking for at the price that we wanted. Had most of the paperwork together by the time we got there and out the door with a beautiful 2020 Tundra pretty fast. Will definitely be back for our next Toyota. ,5.0
2,"March 23, 2020","The sales staff at this dealership c
Made 2  hard inquiries on my credit on the same day. I called asking them to remove one of those hard inquiries and they refused. They were rude, inconsiderate, and unprofessional ",1.0
3,"February 01, 2020","My wife and I were looking for a double cab, long bed Tacoma in a certain color, which proved to be somewhat uncommon. Within 2 hours of talking with Billy Bean about what we wanted, he'd found exactly what we were looking for at a different dealership. BCS Toyota got it shipped in for a price that almost had my wife and I saying ""shut up and take my money"". The time of year and month we made the purchase may have affected their willingness to drop the price, but we were within $15 of our projected purchase price and trade-in value, without any haggling. Our estimates were based on a good amount of pricing research beforehand.   ",5.0
4,"July 03, 2019","My whole family has been buying cars from BCS Toyota since the early 2000s. However, I had a horrible experience with Holden. When we tried to negotiate on a used car and could not reach an agreement, he told us quote “walk out of that door and find yourself a car.” I understand if a business and customer can’t agree on a price, but Holden was too aggressive and demeaning. I did have good experience with other salespeople, but I don’t think my family or I will go back anymore because Holden broke our trust. ",1.8

11,"March 04, 2019","My friend and I visited Bryan College Station Toyota on March 2 to learn the details about 2019 Toyota RAV4 XLE Premium. Brandon Toledo at sales department greeted us with warm hospitality and spend time to describe the detail of the car we were looking for. He was very thorough in description and also helped to compare the similar models/options. 
With all information and assistance, he convinced us to purchase a vehicle on the same day at a very reasonable price. 
Initially we visited just to learn about the car and its specification. However, at the end of the day we purchased TWO 2019 Toyota RAV4 XLE Premium. I recommend any future costumer to visit Bryan College Station Toyota for your next Toyota vehicle purchase. And of course, try to meet Brandon for awesome deal.",4.6

Firstly, they are quick to respond. I had placed an interest on their ONLINE system and in about 1/2 hour time, i recieve a call from Eric Pederson. Eric worked with me, to get the vehicle i wanted and at the price i wanted. From walking through all the features of the vehicle, setting up the apps, paperwork - it has been top notch. Its not just Eric, the whole team at Atkinson, Bryan -TX is committed and will make your visit to buy a Car worth while.

Thanks Eric and Atkinson Team. ",5.0

I would rate the sales and financing department at Atkinson Toyota as excellent. I would highly recommend this dealership to any one.",4.8
24,"October 23, 2018","After hearing good things about Ben Winkle, we requested him when searching for a new Tundra. True to his reputation, he was not only helpful, but clearly honest and trustworthy--critically important traits when purchasing something as expensive as a vehicle. We ended up walking into the dealership and leaving within a few hours with a new truck. A couple of months later, our son needed a used car for his first vehicle. We again contacted Ben, who found the perfect, safe vehicle for our new driver at a very a reasonable cost. Neither the car nor the truck have caused us any problems so far. So if you're looking for a knowledgeable salesperson who will shoot you a straight deal, Ben's your guy!",5.0

He will listen to all of your needs, and he will get you the best deal possible without any high pitched sales hassle or stress. Jacob Corbett is a highly motivated young man with unlimited potential and excellent communication skills! There is no doubt in my mind that Jacob will be Atkinson’s general sales manager in the future!

38,"September 25, 2018",I went to get a Toyota  highlander  or Honda  pilot.  I liked both. The Honda had a few things I liked but the drive out price was 4400.00 cheaper.  The Honda was a 2019 and the Toyota was a  2018. I decided I could live with out them and purchased the Toyota.  The only thing I'm not sure about is the start  and stop. Kinda weird.  Ben was a good salesman and would use  him again. ,5.0

40,"September 24, 2018","The perfect dealer offered a fantastic car with a generous price. Even though it was my first time to buy a car, he nicely introduced and taught me what I need to know for owning a car. Ben gave me clear information. I am absolutely satisfied with the vehicle, the price, and his professionalism. If anyone asked me to recommend any dealer to but a vehicle, I would recommend Ben Winkle without any hesitation. ",5.0
41,"September 23, 2018","I asked Mr Winlke for a quality used automobile. I need something that was in good physical shape and had no problems known of.  I also said I had a limited budget, needed something that I could allow a physically limited person to enter and exit. Ben Winkle introduce me to several automobiles with hybrid propulsion which I really had not considered. He drove these vehicles and then allowed me to drive them to get comfortable with the vehicles.  He told me or showed me much more than the minimum to make a sale.  He showed me that he cared. We looked at several other vehicles which one or the other of us discarded as being what I needed.   Far too many things are on the market that may fit the average person very well but not a specific person.  In my work over the years I have talked to many persons who get all their information form adds or on line from Dr Google.  The information is accurate but most of the folks I talked to had never had Dr. Google come to their farm and look at the situation.  This is what Ben did  ""looked at the situation"" for this i am grateful..

Everyone at the Bryan dealership worked hard and pushed to get us an amazing deal we could pass up! In love with our Tundra, wouldn’t trade it for any other vehicle! Thank you to each and everyone of you and a special thank you to Ben for changing my view after our experience! ",5.0
43,"September 22, 2018","Mr. Winkle was very attentive and professional in the choosing of my new vehicle. I told him the features I was looking for and he had exactly the choice I would have wanted if I had tried to scout around for myself. It saved me much time and trouble I just did not have. He was cooperative, friendly and patient in his instuction of all the new features I was not yet familiar with in these newer vehicles. I would always recommend him highly. Thank you Mr. Winkle.

44,"September 16, 2018",There aren’t many things as exciting as purchasing a new car. The tough part for most people is dealing with a salesperson and the long waits. My husband and I worked with Chris in purchasing our new Camry. I have never had such a pleasant and easy going experience. Chris made us feel like family from the moment we walked in the door. He worked to meet all of our needs while providing excellent customer service. I am happy to recommend Chris to all of my family and friends shopping for a new car. ,5.0

49,"September 07, 2018","My sales consultant was so real and genuine. She's not your average pushy sales consultant who would do or say anything to get a sale. Her remarkable approach made it all the worthwhile. The first thing that impressed me was the inside/out knowledge she had of the SUV (Lexus NX 200T) I purchased. Another high point for me was the fact she was able to do this smooth transition even though she was in Bryan and I was in Houston at work. She was able to drive the SUV to Houston......who does that?...She does and I'm very thankful and grateful. Thank you Carla Lewis for going above and beyond. I also thank you for the stellar experience.

52,"August 22, 2018","Buying an automobile isn’t always a “fun” experience but our buying experience was, and has always been great at Atkinson’s Toyota in College Station.  We recently purchased our second Highlander there (first in 2016) and was again reminded of how the car buying experience has evolved.  For us, the days of high pressure sales and constant badgering by a salesperson have been replaced with transparent communication and a serious focus on customer service.  I suppose this cultural change can be tied to the amount of research a car buyer can accomplish before he or she ever steps foot on the lot, but whatever the reason Atkinson seems to have tapped into the right formula that develops long term customers who believe they are getting a fair value while being treated with the utmost respect.",5.0

He didn't pressure us to spend more, but instead, he helped us reach the price that we had in mind. If you want a salesman who truly cares about finding a vehicle that fits your needs and budget, he is the guy and this is the dealership. They want to see you drive away with the best wheels at the most reasonable price. Another aspect of this dealership that earned our respect was the fact that the online prices matched the tag prices attached to the vehicles. Too many dealerships try to trick you online or raise the price once you're at the lot - not this one. ",5.0

78,"June 17, 2018","I stopped at Atkinson Toyota at Bryan to purchase a used car that is both in good condition and reasonable price. We were helped by Zeeshan Devani (Zee) and Jason Izard. Both gentleman were not only  polite and honest in their advice and communication with me but also experienced and knowledgeable in their business. I found them also friendly and patient. After three visits to the dealership and some phone calls with Zee and Jason, I made my mind and purchased a car. By the end of the day, I have felt that both Jason and Zee are not only professional agents, at a car dealership, that I will seek their assistance for future car purchases but also have become good friends of mine. Indeed, all the staff that I had met there (Jason Patek, Raul Yanez , and Dan Shaw) were respectful. Thank you Atkinson!  ",5.0

I asked for Brandon and turns out that he was the PERFECT person to help us find a car. He asked for some basic information and then went outside to check inventory (in this hot weather). Despite the heat, Brandon was very informative and knowledgeable about a lot of cars and continued to ask what we were looking for in a car. Although I asked him a ton of questions, Brandon remained calm. He was extremely energetic about our first car and to find and select the right car. 

When we finally selected our car, he kept us informed about the process of taking out the vehicle. His customer service went far and beyond what most people have. Whether it was bringing water to drink, finding the people (finance and machanic) to help us out, or to talk to us in a normal conversation, he was the person to make the wait worth while.

132,"October 11, 2016","Atkinson Toyota is the worst experience I have had with a Toyota dealership, and they have proven that on multiple occasions.  Of four visits for service, I have been turned away 3 times. Though the hours posted on their website do not say they are closed, they close for lunch. If you come in later in the evening, when, presumably the staff will be working, they turn you away because they don't want to take on any more cars before closing. No matter what time I came in, Atkinson Toyota was totally unwilling to help, so clearly they are not hurting for business. However, I received a sales call from Carla in the service department reminding me that I was due for an oil change, and when I explained to her why I would rather drive 100 miles to a different dealership that provides EXCELLENT service (Fort Bend Toyota) she acted appalled at the service (or lack thereof) I had received. She apologized, said she would speak with the service manager, Craig Fletcher, and that he would likely call me back because she believed he would be just as upset by my experience.  However, a couple of hours later, she called me back, and boy had the tone changed. Apparently Craig Fletcher is fine with turning away paying customers, because he claimed the hours were on the door. So, too bad. Well, unfortunately, I cannot see the door from my home, and used the hours posted on the website for reference.  Silly me! My mistake. Though Carla, he claimed they would change the website, though it is about a month later and the website still shows no closing for lunch.  The utter lack of concern he couldn't be bothered to express is alarming, and clearly he has no regard for his customers or their time.  Well, Atkinson Toyota may not be hurting for business now, but if they continue to treat customers the way they treated me, I imagine they will be in due time. And I can assure you when they call me to ""remind"" me I am due for service, this is one customer who will not be back! I have never seen a manager who couldn't be bothered like Craig Fletcher, and I hope you do not have the misfortune of trying to speak with him.",1.0

139,"January 15, 2016","I came in to have my oil changed today. I have a Toyota, but did not buy it at Atkinson Toyota (wish now I had, but hind-site is always 20/20). Prior to coming here, I first went to the dealership from where I purchased my car, and was told the charge would be $150 for a regular oil change (with 4 quarts of full synthetic oil). Not only was the price too high; the service staff was rude and unaccomodating, and there was no direction as to where to go (I had to ask twice which garage door to go to). It was frustrating, to say the least.  So, I called Atkinson, and was told it would be $60, so I headed there instead. There are NO words descriptive enough to express how wonderful the staff handles their customers at Atkinson Toyota.  As soon as you pull into the parking lot, there are clear signs directing you where to go. Not only are there signs, but there are also staff members whose job is to stop and direct you where to drive, where to pull in, etc. ...nothing but clear-cut communication from start to finish.  They have a plush waiting room with 3 different types of complimentary coffee, and plenty of comfy chairs and couches to relax on while waiting. In addition, they also had complimentary iPads to use while waiting!  I have NEVER been to any car service center with this type of service. Communication, organization, and friendly respect is what you can EXPECT to receive here!  I HIGHLY recommend Atkinson Toyota! Thank you all SO much for this easy and relaxing experience.

141,"October 22, 2015","So I really struggled with whether or not to even write a review about my experience since even the thought that I might have to ever deal with Atkinson Toyota ever again makes me irritable if that tells you anything. But here I am in hopes that some other first time buyer will do more research on their reviews than I did.

If you've never been to Atkinson Toyota, let me set the scene for you. You pull in and are greeted by kind college aged (?) ladies holding ipads who ask you, as best they can over the blaring music of the dealership (btw, really odd choices of music throughout the day if you ask me, that was the first time I've heard N'Sync or 1980's Madonna in years - so distracting but that's the point), if you're there for sales or service. Answer and they'll point you where to go and call whoever it is you're set up with. I went inside to sales. The financing department is behind a keypad locked door of a tiny see thru glass office and you can rent an ipad to use by giving them your driver's license while you wait for whatever it is you're waiting for in the poorly air conditioned building.  The cheering during their morning meeting and the cowbells going off over the ever present, ever droning intercom whenever they made a sale is pretty tacky. Go in around 9 ish in the morning during the week and you'll see what I'm talking about. It's really odd. They are really all about sales and seem to have forgotten about genuine customer service.

A few things: it was hard to get a word in edgewise when talking with the salesman and/or the manager (I actually said this point blank to the manager and he didn't even pause but rather just kept going on and on and on about how he's got a good reputation, been in the biz for over 16 years and bla bla bla), they drop a lot of prominent political names when they're talking about themselves, the salesman was adamant that we were in College Station and not Bryan (so weird but whatever) apparently the pressure is extremely high if you make the mistake of coming in near the end of the month since they're all trying to make quotas, felt like I wasn't able to leave the tiny cramped finance office where I was told he had already pressed Enter. Ended up with a car that didn't really suit my needs but what can you really do other than trade it in. I learned, later, that I could have just walked out at that point and been done with the whole mess but they reallllly pressure you at the end of the month - think of a tiny cramped glass room with poor a/c, sitting across from an acrimonious finance guy, the nervous sales guy in the background and the agitated sales manager in the doorway (agitated because the sales guy said 2.9% and here they were trying to get you at something like 5%), music still playing, water all gone after waiting for what seems like an eternity for them to put in the paperwork.

I'm not a fan of this place. It is high pressure, just subtle. They lock you in before you have a chance to think and keep right on talking even when you tell them to give you a minute or two to think about it,  so I don't think customer service is their priority but rather getting inventory out the door is more important than developing long term customer relations. Definitely feels like I should have gone with a more down to earth dealership instead of letting myself get taken in by the 'high end' stuff going on over there.

Would I buy a Toyota again? Probably yes but not from this dealer and not for a very long time.

Once discovered that the vehicle was no longer on the lot, he had us wall through the outside if the service area parking lot to the Southside of the dealership, & shows ME a car that wasn't even what I'd requested to see. He didn't listen at all. I drive a Camry SE, with the sports package, and I wanted the same items in my new vehicle. He wasn't knowledgeable about any vehicle he showed me.

147,"April 24, 2012","In 2006, I purchased a brand new Toyota Tacoma Pre-Runner Double Cab at Atkinson Toyota in Bryan, Texas.  I had almost all of my maintenance done at Toyota during the last 6 years.  The exception being about 3 times when the time arrived to have maintenance done and I was not near Bryan, so had it done elsewhere.  But I always asked for the best synthetic oil they had.   This was also before the complimentary “Toyota Care” that Toyota dealerships are now offering.  I paid over $60 for each and every visit to Atkinson Toyota to have my truck maintained there during these last 6 years.

I put a total of 165K miles on the truck.  I commute to work 44 miles one way each day.  While that seems like a lot of miles, it’s nothing to a Toyota.  These vehicles will normally last forever.

What I describe below is what happened to me now 6 years later.

February 25, 2012 – Drove truck to Atkinson Toyota for regular service check, oil change, tire rotation etc.  They recommended air filter and cabin filter to be replaced, (which I had done).  Ultimately the truck checked out fine, the only recommendation was that the tires will probably need to be replaced with next visit or certainly the one after that.

February 27, 2012 – While driving to work, my wife said she heard a funny noise “clicking” coming from the engine. I turned off the radio and didn’t hear anything and assumed it was nothing major.

March 6th, 2012 – While driving to work, right after passing Cooks Point, both my wife and I heard a loud clicking noise coming from the engine.  I thought it sounded a lot like a belt hitting something as it was spinning around and pulled over.  No unusual lights were flashing on my dash and the gauges all seemed fine.  I opened up the hood and checked the belts, but they were all fine, and I didn’t see anything else unusual, no smoke or any strange, burning smells either.  I decided to continue the trip and first drop my wife off at work and then drive to Atkinson to have them check it out.  However, about 2 miles past The Brazos River, the noise got even louder and shortly afterwards the engine died.  I coasted over to the side of the HWY (21) and again noticed no lights flashing on my dashboard and gauges all normal.  There was no smoke or any other unusual smells either. I opened up the hood again and this time decided to check the oil.  I pulled the dip stick out and noticed that there was no oil on it at all.

Thinking this is unusual, I put the dip stick back in and pulled it out again and repeated this two more times.  No oil.  I took out my cell phone and snapped a picture.

Then I called Atkinson Toyota and spoke to Freddie.  He sent a tow truck.  Once the tow truck and I got to Atkinson, Freddie informed me they would take a look and call me, and arranged for a shuttle to take me to work.  It was 9:30 AM by this time.  I called Freddie at about 12 PM, and asked for an update, he said they don’t know anything yet and he would let me know when they find out the problem.

March 6th, 2012  – At 4PM, I called Freddie again, (they have now had the truck most of the day), and I asked for an update.  All Freddie could tell me is that they found an oil leak.  I said, ok and just to let you know, I noticed this morning on the side of the road, that the dip stick didn’t have any oil and that I snapped a picture of it with my phone.  He said “Ok, we will check that out, and I noticed that you had your oil changed here just last week….”  I said “Yes that’s correct”.  Freddie’s next response was “Well, if we did anything wrong, we will fix it”.

March 6th, 2012  – At 5 PM, Freddie called me back and he said, “we checked the oil first thing this morning when the truck arrived, and there is plenty of oil in there, it’s almost full and we also have pictures”.  I found this rather interesting, because an hour earlier he never mentioned that they had already checked the oil first thing in the morning, and his response that “We also have pictures” was very odd.  He also said that the oil was dirty and sludgy.  Strange since just a week earlier, the oil was changed, and it should not have been dirty at all.  Freddie then asked “What are your intentions with this truck?”  I found this to be a very odd question and not one I liked to hear.  I said “That sounds a little strange, what exactly do you mean?” he replied “Well, the engine is damaged, a rod has punctured about a 2 or 3 inch hole in the engine block, and the repairs will be more than the truck is worth”.  I said “You have to
be kidding?!!, it’s a 2006 Toyota Tacoma with 165 thousand miles on it..  Toyota’s normally don’t have problems like this and will usually last until 200 to 300 thousand miles”. He agreed, but said something definitely went wrong here.  Now, I had only 1 more payment remaining (due at the end of March) on this truck and was really looking forward to not having any more payments for at least another year perhaps even 2.  I asked Freddie to get me quotes on repairs or engine replacements anyway.  He said he would be able to get them for me in the morning.

March 7, 2012 – I borrowed my mother’s truck and arrived at Atkinson Toyota at 8AM, and met with Freddie, who took me to the truck and showed me that the dip stick had oil in it. He also showed me a fair amount of oil on the left side of the engine and a piece of broken off metal and said if you look underneath, you’ll see a nice 2 to 3 inch hole in the block.   I said, “this truck has to be worth at least 12K, are you telling  me a new engine will cost more than that?”  He said, “yes, about that…  I cleaned out the truck and took all personal possessions out (IE: CD’s, paperwork etc…)  Then I went back to wait for Freddie to get me the numbers on the engines.  I waited in the waiting area about 30 minutes, when Freddie returned.  He told me that a used engine
with a 6 month warranty, would be about $6,200, and rebuilt engine with a 3 year warranty would be $10,095.  Or we could trade it in on a new truck. At this time, I was very frustrated, because I believe Toyota was at fault here. They just changed the oil a week ago, and I know for a fact that yesterday there was NO OIL on the dip stick when I checked it.  But now suddenly (after they had the truck for a full day), the oil was nearly full.  While I couldn’t prove it, I firmly believe they poured oil in there during the day yesterday after I clearly mentioned to Freddie that I had a picture of the dip stick with no oil on it.  I told Freddie that I think I’ll have to go visit with my attorney at this time, because I think I’m getting screwed.  I left.  About 30 minutes later, I received a call from Nate Lucas.  He asked if there was something that could be done?  I mentioned to him that I wanted to discuss my options and he said the person I need to speak to is Craig Fletcher.  He’s the general manager.  I said fine, let’s make an appointment with Craig, and he said Craig is off today and will be in tomorrow after 2 PM.  Again, it seems like I was getting the run around.  I told Mr. Lucas that I was prepared to meet with my attorney because I really felt like I was getting the run around and shafted on this.  I hung up the phone and then remembered that I saw Paul Atkinson (the owner) running around there earlier.  Hey I thought, if the general manager can do something, but wasn’t available, then the owner who is available, should be able to do something as well.

I called back and asked Mr. Lucas if I could meet with Mr. Atkinson?  He first said that Mr. Atkinson isn’t here, and then I mentioned that I had seen him while I was there less than an hour ago.  He said he would find him and call me back.  10 Minutes later, Mr. Lucas called me back, and stated Mr. Atkinson will meet with me between 1:30 and 2 PM.  In the meantime I decided to research the truck with Kelley Blue Book (kbb.com).  After
entering all the info on my truck, I came up with 3 different numbers:  Fair value was about 8K, Good about 10K, and Excellent about 12K.  I picked the lowest rating (fair, there was no poor rating), and figured if I can get a trade in for around $7 to $8 thousand, on a new truck, I would take that deal.  Again, I figured if the general manager (Craig Fletcher) can do that, then the owner (Paul Atkinson) should also be able to make a deal like that.

March 7th, 2012  – At 1:30 I meant with Mr. Atkinson.  He stated that I was pretty adamant about meeting with him today and he didn’t really know why because there was nothing he could do to help me.   I explained the situation, and showed him the picture of the dip stick, clearly showing no oil.  His immediate response was “We did not put any oil in that truck”.  I told him I was not directly accusing him of that either, but that I still felt that either Toyota had some liability here, or there was some sort of manufacturing defect because Toyota’s do not normally die at less than 200K miles.  Many times they last up to 300K miles easily without a problem. He said “You have 165K miles on this thing.  What did you expect?”  I was a little surprised at that response, and I re-iterated, that this is nothing for a Toyota.  I told him we were a Toyota family, my mother has one, my son has one, we have recommended friends and neighbors to Atkinson and I thought since I got 99% of my services done at Atkinson, I could get a little help on this.  He stated that Craig Fletcher is the man I need to speak to, and that he (himself) can’t do anything. This is the owner of the place for crying out loud and he can’t do anything to help??  Only his general manager can help?  That makes zero sense here.  I told him I didn’t want anything for free, but I also didn’t want to be raked over the coals and it really felt like I was.  I also stated that I want to work with them, and if a trade in is possible, I want a good fair trade in value, not a 2 or 3 thousand one just to
be done with it.  He said if you really want to work with us, don’t mention the word “attorney” again.  All of my employees are trained to shut down when you mention “attorney” and they will not say another word if that happens.  If you do it again, I will hand you the name/number to our attorney and that will be the end.  I said fair enough, and re-iterated that I only did that because I was frustrated and felt like I was getting the run around.  He said I would need to wait until tomorrow to speak to Craig who would be here after 2PM.

March 8th, 2012 – 9:30 AM, I called Tegeler Toyota in Brenham.  I spoke to a woman named Joanne and told her the whole story, and what Atkinson told me it would cost…  She was flabbergasted as the numbers they gave me just don’t make sense (IE: $6,200 for a used engine and $10,095 for a rebuilt one).  I told her that I was willing to take a trade in but that I also didn’t want to be raked over the coals, and she fully agreed.  She began to take down information on my truck and would talk to her used car sales manager to see what kind of offer they could give me for a trade in on the truck.  She was certain it was going to be worth my while.

March 8th, 2012 – At 2PM, I meant with Craig Fletcher.  So far, he has been the nicest person to deal with at Atkinson.  He stated that he knows I’m a loyal customer and that I have been having all my services done at Toyota, and that he is sure we can work something out.  I told him that paying for a used or rebuilt engine is pretty much out.  I would much rather do a trade in, but as I stated yesterday, I did not want to be raked over the coals on this.  I wanted a better deal on a trade in then I would normally get because I still felt that Toyota was at fault here.  He stated that he already briefly checked out my truck, and that there was oil in it, the plug and filter were tight.  He said if either of those were loose, there would be a splatter of oil all the way from the oil pan to the back bumper, and he did not see any such evidence.  But without pulling the engine apart and doing a complete diagnostic, he said there is no way to know what exactly happened.  He did recommend doing that, and if it turns out they are at fault, he would see to it that Toyota would fix it.  However, if not, then I would be responsible for the repairs.  He did however also state that they would be willing to “split the difference” with me.  Now that’s a strange thing to say…  If you are not responsible, why would you split the difference of the repairs??  That almost sounds like an admission of guilt to me.  I then asked about a trade in, and he said he would go speak to a sales manager to see what kind of deal I could get.  We had discussed the Kelley Blue Book values and I told him that I thought the truck was worth about 17K (I had inadvertently said 17K instead of 10K) in excellent condition.  He pulled it up and showed me the
8K vs 10K that I had found yesterday…   I believe that if they put in a 3K engine (used), that they could sell it for between 15 to 17K, and that’s what I had meant when I said it was worth about 17K.  In any event, I told Craig that I think around 7K to 8K would be an equitable amount on a trade in.

Craig said he would go talk to the sales manager and be right back.  He did come back about 10 minutes later and he stated that the trade in would be about $4,500 max.  I thought this number was ridiculously low considering that I still believe that Toyota had some liability here…  That was a very disappointing thing to hear.  He recommended again, that I should consider repairs, and that a used engine would probably work for about a year and then I can trade in the truck on a new one.  He was also still willing to pull the engine apart and find the root cause of the problem and that there was still a 50% chance that they (Toyota) did something wrong and would be required to fix the truck under their insurance.  I asked him how long it would take to determine that.  Because I have now been without a vehicle for 3 days.  He said he could have an answer for me by this time tomorrow.  I told him to begin the diagnostics and I left.

At 6:00 PM that evening, Joanne from Tegeler Toyota called me back and said their offer was $6,500 cash, plus $1000 cash back offer which I can put  towards a new truck.  In addition, they would pay off the old truck (one month payment), and would even tow the truck from Atkinson in Bryan to Tegeler in Brenham.  I told her it sounds great, and let’s do it.   I realized that I had told Craig to start dismantling my truck and needed to stop him if he hadn’t started yet.  I tried calling Craig back to tell him not to start the tear down of the truck.  But Atkinson was already closed. I left my number and asked Craig to call me
back first thing in the morning.  So, what took Atkinson Toyota 4 days to do, Tegeler Toyota did in less than 8 hours.  I now have a new 2012 Toyota Tacoma (we’re still a Toyota family).

I was very pleased with the deal including some extras they threw in along with a superb financing rate through Toyota Motor Credit.  

Their internet salesman, Richard Miller, is an absolute pleasure to deal with.  Responsive, friendly, helpful and honest.  My previous experience with Richard and Atkinson Toyota in September 2010 when I bought my wife's Land Cruiser was equally pleasureable.  

I highly recommend this dealership!",4.4
149,"March 04, 2011","Maybe my worst experience ever. I realize that when you buy a new car from a dealership you have to ""play the game"" when it comes to negotiating price and trade in value, but this dealership was the worst.  I went in to buy a new Prius and the first thing the salesman told me was that all Prius' vehicles are sold at sticker price because they are in such demand. They had at least 12 Prius' on the lot. Then they offered me $4,000 less than Kelly blue book trade in value. Needless to say I left the lot. The next day I went to Joe Myers Toyota in Houston and purchased my Prius. They gave me the full trade in value for my trade AND they came $1,000 off the sticker price!  If anyone buys a new Toyota from Atkinson Toyota without shopping around has more money than sence!",1.8
