1,"May 27, 2020","DECEPTIVE & SHADY... Take your business elsewhere. The prices they post on Autotrader and their dealership website are $6k-$7k less than the true sales prices. Online, the car we were interested in was marketed as $16,200 plus TT&L. When we got there, they let us know they couldn't sell it for less than $23k. They also marketed the APR as 0.9% for those with near perfect credit. Surprise, surprise when we came in, their best interest rate for 60 months on new cars was suddenly 3.99%. When we walked out, they followed us saying that if we'd stay, they'd give us the car for $16,900 out the door after ALL fees and features. We agreed, but while we were signing final paperwork, they removed features originally included with the car without telling us even though those features were part of the car we agreed to purchase. Now, no one at the dealership will take our calls, return our emails, or send us copies of the paperwork we signed showing that these features were specifically listed on the paperwork we initially signed for the vehicle. Our 18 yr old daughter is now forced to either return the new car she worked so hard to earn or get over the fact they stripped it of the bells and whistles we were specifically looking for to protect her and her new car.

2,"May 15, 2020","I don’t know if it gets any worse in car buying expensive...they will tell you anything you want to hear until they have that cash in their hands. I recently purchased a car from them first they told me there’s two warranties that I could NOT decline “they come with the car” there was no way of declining them, CPO & ELO, they told me all the benefits, okay fine I guess if I can’t decline what can I do...there were some things they told me they would fix, they take care of all of them. They took of the ELO that was “impossible” to take off when I asked, they didn’t bother mentioning it to me, and didn’t bother lowering that price that they quoted me that it cost. When it was time to get the things “fixed” that they promised, they fixed one thing the rest they said they never told me they would fix. These are a bunch of dishonest people who tell you anything at first to sell you a car...GET EVERYTHING IN WRITING BEFORE BUYING!!!!!! Better yet go else where. They care about one thing only and that is their sales.",1.0

He didn't have a noticeable agenda. Tony's a good dude, and that's why I stayed. I wasn't going to purchase, but his customer service was top-notch.",4.4

6,"October 22, 2019","Bad experience! The dealership technician has changed my fuel pump, and service adviser Brandon  Bristow said that I need to install the new battery as well.  Brandon told me that my original battery is completely down/uncharged. I paid for the new battery and fuel pump, but then I decided to check the condition of my 1 year old battery at Walmart. I have purchased my battery from Walmart. Walmart technician told that my battery is good. My battery has 2 years warranty and passed load test. I have attached the the receipt from the Walmart diagnostic center to this feedback. Conclusion: please stay away from this place because employees there are not honest. They are lying to the customers. I won't by Nissan again.",1.0
7,"September 14, 2019","I have been a loyal Nissan customer for about 17 years. For the last several years I have been bringing my vehicles to Autonation Nissan in Lewisville.  It anymore. I’m sitting in the Servicing department waiting area, writing this as I speak. They used to be awesome! I don’t know what has happened, but the last time (a couple of months ago) I brought my daughter’s car in to get it serviced, ended up spending almost $2k and the guy who was handling my ticket was barely responsive. He was eager to sell me a bunch of stuff, but forgot to follow up or just got to busy, and when i showed up the next day after trying repeatedly to call and check status, he had nothing ready. Then he said his system was not matching the quote (sounded like he was trying g to get more $), so we had to haggle in front of everyone. It was so embarrassing. I hesitated to come back again, but I believe in second chances. This time I brought my car. All I needed / wanted was an oil change and star inspection. I chose to work with a different service advisor than last time (although I could see the same guy was still working here that waited on me last time). She was ok at first. Seemed friendly enough, but then about an hour and a half later, she said they couldn’t do inspection because car died (I have a 2014 Nissan Juke that I keep in pristine condition. I always bring it here!). I asked if we could go ahead and just replace the battery, so they could complete inspection and she said she would have to check. A few minutes later, I saw her return from talking to mechanic, but she just sat back down at her desk. I had to go to her to get a status. This time she wasn’t very friendly. She said the mechanic said he would try to inspect it. I said I thought it couldn’t be inspected because of dead battery?  She then just told me “I know...it’s a little confusing” (huh?) and said they would see what they can do. I told her again to go ahead and just put in a new battery, but she said I have to wait an additional 10-15 min to see what they can do. If the battery is the problem (she confirmed I need a new battery) and I’m willing to pay for one, why can’t she just put it in and do the darn inspection?! So frustrated. Never coming back!!!",1.4
8,"August 08, 2019",AutoNation Lewisville has no professionalism and they don't respect their time and their customers time. Anthony Gonzales is the worst sale person i met. they don't have the attitude and willingness to close the deals and sell cars in their inventory. they claim to have best price online but i got even better deal from another dealership and i was spared to get into their trap. Stay away from them.,1.0
9,"July 18, 2019","They are relentless and even after being asked to stop contacting me John Williams continued to contact me. Not sure what was so hard for him to understand I'm taking my business elsewhere and don't want to buy from them. Because of reasons like this, they don't have the capacity to listen to what they are being told. WORST EXPERIENCE!! ",1.0
10,"July 17, 2019","F better business bureau rating.  Will not accept or return calls.  Failed to payoff a loan leaving us to pay $2500.  Sure, everyone says ""worst experience of my life"".  I really mean it.  Traded in a leased car.  Didnt pay it in full.  Now our home loan is denied  insurance rates higher due to credit score.  Credit bureau reached out  no response.  Nissan reached out  no response.

Dispicable service.  ",1.6
11,"July 07, 2019","Came for service because my engine light was on.  I had my car placed on a diagnostic machine prior to coming to the dealer. I brought the code with me and explained the problem. Aaron said he would get back to me once they had run their own diagnostic.  I called later that day...nothing. I called the next day...nothing. Day 3 he said the couldn't find anything but that I needed my AC flushed. Mind you I had no trouble with my AC at all prior to the visit for service. $540 later my engin light came back on after 2 days of driving the car. When I called back, I was told it would be another $95 to see why the engine light was on.  This was the initial reason for bringing the cat in and you said the cat had been repaired and that the work was guaranteed.  How is this a guarantee?  Then 2 weeks later my AC goes out completely.  I will never go back to this place again for any reason. The poor service,  high prices and unethical practices are very disappointing. ",1.2
12,"May 15, 2019","Let me start off by saying I’m proud of my son. He works hard for what he wants. He was finally able to buy his FIRST car. One of his proudest moments. Look at that smile. He bought him a BMW 5 series. The “staff” was even happy for him.  (See Pics)

This is where it gets bad. 5 days after purchase the engine started knocking and wouldn’t start. We tried contacting Autonation Nissan Lewisville  1st day(Thursday) NO ANSWER OR CALL BACK. 2nd day(Friday) SAME THING. The 3rd day(Saturday) we finally got in contact with AutoNation and they told us that there was no one at their place of business that’s certified to work on BMWs on a Saturday but my son needed to get the car towed to their shop. So we asked him(Steve service manager) WHY do we need to have the car towed to them? That is when he offered to get it towed but it had to be Monday. Of course days has passed. So now we’re passed the “5 day” mark. They came got the car Monday and needless to say they’ve had the car every since. My son has been calling/texting them and as you can see in the pictures of text msgs they are full of s*** and not trying to help. My son cried because now he just want his money back and they are NOT trying to help him. Granted 2 weeks later they gave him a loaner car and offered to “help” him with another car BUT IT HAS TO BE A NISSAN SENTRA. WHAT? My son is 6’2 soak and wet, why in the xxxx would he want to fold himself in a Sentra? 

Till this day we are still waiting to see what AutoNation is going to do. I am going to help my son fight this. He or anyone else doesn’t deserve this. So I have contacted BB and the business licensing board. I will NOT stop until my son gets what he worked hard for. I hope this helps others from going through this nightmare. 
DO NOT, I REPEAT DO NOT BUY FROM  AutoNation Nissan Lewisville FOR YOU WILL REGRET IT. 

SIGNED THE ANGRY PARENT. 
Please share. My son still don’t have his car. Thank you..",2.2
13,"May 08, 2019","I have purchased a few cars from AutoNation and this is the first time I over paid for a trade in. I called spoke with the accounting dept. and was informed that they owed me $287.00 for the balance and was waiting for the title to clear. The lady in accounting (Riegn) said it would take two weeks. I waited three weeks and nothing. I called Reign back a couple of times and she had another person call me back(Dode). I spoke with Dode on Friday morning and she was going to call me back that day. I never heard from her, so I called her back on Tuesday without a return phone call. I called on Wednesday and asked to speak with the sales manager and was transferred to the operator. I called back and asked to speak to the sales manager and was transferred to a guy named Spencer and was informed that I needed to talk with accounting across the street at AutoNation Honda. I informed him that I have called them 6 times and have never received a call back. He forwarded my call to the finance dept. were I was informed to call the accounting dept. I have called around 15 times and have never spoke to anyone that was willing to help me figure out who I really need to speak to and get this resolved. It is going on seven weeks and still have not got to speak to the sales manager. I will say that he did thank me when I was buying the car seven weeks ago. I am so disappointed in the treatment that I have received after I purchased the car, it has been horrible. I am buying another car next week and it will not be from the AutoNation Corporation!!! Maybe this will get resolved in my lifetime!!",1.0
14,"May 03, 2019","Do not buy a car here. I bought a car here, we had left a garage opener in the car we traded in. When I left, I called and asked the Salesman to get it, his name was Que. He said he did and put it in the safe. I have called multiple times, we even went to pick it up, when we came to get, they said it was locked in safe and no one was there to get it. Said they would mail it to me. Never have got it. My salesman no longer works there, called and talk to Spencer another salesman. He promised he would fix and call me, he didn’t. 

As far as the car buying experience, find another dealer. I was promised so much for my trade, once we got to the deal it changed. I was promised they could match the interest rate my credit union had, once we got ready to sign papers it changed. 

Bottom line, the lie and cheat and can’t keep their word. Now since they have my garage opener and know my address they could rob us. So if you are thinking of buying here look elsewhere. I can’t stand people who lie, because if they lie what else are they capable of. I hope this review helps someone so they don’t make the mistake I made. ",2.2
15,"April 23, 2019","I purchased a 2003 Ford Focus from Stephen Goodrick with sales manager being John Williams, CFS Manager Marcus Rojas. This happened 11/29/18. It did not have a license plate or registration sticker.  After about 4 1/2 months still not received, Phone calls were ignored with no callbacks. I got hail damage from a storm, filed claim with my insurance company.  Car is totaled with back windshield blown out and hail damage on the top of the car. Turns out my car is not in my name so I cannot get my insurance money.  Went back there (I live off US 75-and traveled to I35) and got stonewalled. One guy named Irvin told me it would be taken care off. Irwin went into the office next door who has a sign ""I was a master drill sergeant"" and this guy just laughs.  ",1.6
16,"March 12, 2019","I recently bought a used car at this dealership.  They sold me an extended warranty that was supposed to cover ""ANYTHING"" mechanical.  Within a week of buying the car, the engine started running rough and the parts of the engine that were broken, were not covered under the warranty.  I was never sent the warranty information, what it covered, or anything!  I have sent numerous emails and made calls to get this information ,because my car is now experiencing more problems and no one will return a call or email.  I am about to spend $3,000 in repairs, for a car that I have not even made the first payment on!  It was a low mile car, and so far the mechanics I have had look at these issues say the dealer should have been able to assess and fix before they sold the car.  I know all car places suck and are some shady xxxxxxxx, but they take it to a whole new level.  Bunch of cowards that work here and I DO NOT RECOMMEND THEM AT ALL.  In fact, they pissed me off so much, I will avoid all Auto Nation dealers for the rest of my life.",1.0

21,"September 14, 2018",Highly recommend Sales Consultant Matu Ambaye and New Car Director Vijay Desai. Bought new Altima. Some issues came up regarding negotiations made via email and phone conversations. Both gentleman went out of their way to make this deal go down. Car was for my 85 year old father. I can not thank you enough. ,5.0
22,"September 01, 2018","Throughout the entire process, they threw almost every devious used car scam at us. For anyone who is thinking of buying from this dealer, I kindly listed them all below with our experiences.

1.	Hiding add-ons in the Agreement
After test driving the vehicle I called Capital One to tell them which vehicle we chose so we could get approximate figures. They gave us everything we needed, including advice on what to look out for from the dealers. Feeling good about the process they described to us we go back to pick up the vehicle that we test drove 2 days before.

Manny (Salesman), upon getting our finance from Capital One paperwork, leaves and comes back with a short agreement detailing the sale and asked us to sign. I look it over carefully and see $389 for tint. What is this I ask, he said that if for the tint. I tell him that I don’t want tint I’m fine with what’s already on the vehicle. After unsuccessfully trying to convince me about this add-on, I tell him no deal and tell my wife let’s go. At this point, he goes into the dealership and before we pull off, the sales manager comes out and apologizes. He says, he is losing money on the deal and that was an add-in to offset his loss. REALLY… I told him that I was only paying for what was advertised online which was on the dealer sticker, nothing more – nothing less.
He tells us if he can get the bank to take back their banking fees (whatever that means) he would do the deal. So the waiting game began.

2.	Internet Low-Balling
The sales manager was insisting he was losing money on the deal due to the online advertising guys. I didn’t care either way. I just wanted them to honor what they had advertised and what I drove over 40 miles (twice) to get.

3.	Changing Figures in the Lease Agreement/ Focusing on the payment
After sitting for close to an hour, Manny comes up apologizing again about the tint and says we took the tint off, now you can sign. He throws in, “and we got it at the price you wanted with the monthly payments you had before”. Now, I’m really looking at it closely; and I see it. What they had done was taken the APR which was 12% and jacked it up to 15.9% somehow giving me close to the monthly payment but making the deal more expensive. REALLY!!! 

I ask Manny how many more tactics they were going to try. I told him to stop playing games before I leave. He apologized (AGAIN) and went back to the “Little Den of Thieves”. At this point, I’m wondering if it’s even worth it. But the deal that they advertised (that they were trying to renege on) was a good deal. I figured they just wouldn’t blatantly go back on the deal especially after being caught doing all the above; so I played the waiting game.

4.	Flat Out changing the window sticker
The dealer sticker clearly had the 90 day 100% warranty checked. When they bring the sticker to us to sign, it had “As Is” checked. I tell Manny, “Are ya’ll kidding me!” He assures me this was the original sticker and I vehemently tell him that it wasn’t. We go to John who now really kicks on with the “Good Guy – Bad Guy” act, he tells me this cannot be. He tells Manny to go back to where they cleaned the car to see if he could find the other sticker. Manny comes back with it all crumpled up and says it was in the trash, again apologizing to us. At this point, I’m ready to go, but John says ok, let me make this right, so we can get your business. We wait longer

5.	Good Guy – Bad Guy & Bait and Switch
After almost 4 hours John the sales manager comes over and says this deal is costing me too much, we’re not going to do it. I will sell you another car but not this one for that price. (Bait and Switch) Really!!!
I jump up and tell me wife let’s go and we leave. As we’re driving off, I look over and see her crying. I asked what’s wrong. She asks “Was it a bad deal?” I told her it wasn’t a bad deal, but it wasn’t the deal they advertised; I did not come to get a bad deal or even a fair deal, I came because it was presented as a Great Deal. 

6.	Packed payments
I guess a fair deal is better than a disappointed wife. I turned around and end up buying the vehicle for my wife, without the warranty that they initially advertised. They convinced me into buying their warranty and gap insurance. I had to wipe my hands on my shirt from all the Vaseline that I got on it by shaking their hand to seal the deal. I end up dropping the extended warranty and gap a week later after discovering how much I would end up paying them for the life of the loan. 

7.	Delay Tactics
Frustrated by a buying experience that was touted by their website as being “hassle-free”, “comfortable”, and with “no-pressure”, we ended up staying over 5 hours.

8.	Multiple Unauthorized pulls on Credit
We came in with APPROVED financing and told them, on more than one occasion, “Do not shop us to other finance companies”. 2 WEEKS AFTER PURCHASE WE GET MULTIPLE “WE’RE UNABLE TO APPROVE YOUR CREDIT APPLICATION LETTERS” FROM LENDERS. They did it anyway. Of course, our credit score has taken the hits. If you have read this far RUN FROM THESE GUYS!!!

23,"August 17, 2018","The best thing with AutoNation is their pricing which is set by a nationwide team. But the sales team at Lewisville Nissan is unfriendly, terrible, lazy and full of lies. I had good experience with AutoNation Ford but these guys need a better management. I approached them giving business but they never called back. After taking an appointment I traveled 40mi to be told that the vehicle is in transit. Their sales will make you lose interest in buying with their lackluster engagement. They make you wait for hours and ask you to come back later. experience with this dealership is rock bottom. ",1.2
24,"June 02, 2018","Hi, 
Today i bought a 2018 Nissan Sentra SV from this dealer, but the dealer gave the vehicle with 563 miles driven vehicle. Atleast when they sign the deal, they should have informed about this.They didn't say anything about this. At the time of delivery, when we ask about this, they are asking me to take a vehicle with 1755 miles.I can understand its a new vehicle, but they would have told this before..they have showed the vehicle with 50 or 60 miles, but given the one with very high miles. Moreover we found many dirts in the car, the Sales Rep asked us to find the dirt and the car went for cleaning 3 to 4 times. We felt very bad about that. I agree those are the only dealer providing the low price for Nissan cars than all other dealers. That's why we are coming to them and there should be some negotiations and anger..but i'm expecting them to be little friendliness to the customers..",2.8
25,"March 16, 2018","I have been a loyal customer of Auto Nation Nissan Lewisville for years – this is my third car from them, and I’ve sent countless recommendations their way. They’ve officially lost my business over an outstanding lack of customer service. My husband brought my Rogue in for a 20,000 mile service before I left for a road trip, explaining to Jessie our service tech, that I had to be on the road no later than 5pm and that we didn’t want anything done to my car other than the 20k service. When my husband went to pick up the vehicle, the invoice was astronomically higher than the agreed upon price — Jessie had taken it upon himself to add almost $100 worth of “top of the line” windshield wipers to my car plus labor, without any prior authorization to add them to my vehicle. Due to the rush to get on the road, we paid and decided to deal with the issue when we returned on Monday. Upon receiving the actual vehicle, we noticed a 2-inch-long deep scratch along the rear panel that was not there before dropping the vehicle off for service. 

My husband called and asked to speak with Pete, the service director who ultimately said we couldn’t prove the scratch happened in service, and that he would only refund two of the three windshield wiper blades because “one was manufacturer recommended.” That’s not acceptable, none of the blades should have been applied to my car because it was never authorized in the first place. Then Jessie called, arguing with my husband. He stated “when your wife brought the car in, I told her that windshield wiper blades were a part of the package.” Well, my husband brought the car in – I didn’t. Three days passed and neither our credit, nor any phone calls were returned by Auto Nation. So I escalated to Dustin Osborne, the General Manager. 

When my phone call to Dustin was unreturned, I asked the receptionist at AutoNation for her help, and she emailed him, ccing Pete – explaining the situation. Within the hour, I had a phone call from Pete saying we had a refund for the windshield wipers but still not addressing the scratch on my car or even apologizing for this 5 day wild goose chase they sent me on. Dustin Osborne has yet to reach out and acknowledge the situation either. Auto Nation doesn’t care about taking care of your vehicle or about your long-term business. Take your money somewhere else!

26,"February 28, 2018","Let me start with the positive; The ladies at the desks handling tags and loaner cars are great.  Our sales team was great.  They were so great we didn’t mind getting the warranties or buying 2 cars in 2 months.

Now the negative stuff;
We had an issue with our 2015 Nissan Pathfinder.  The fan in the front which feeds air flow to the AC cracked.  No problem, took it to the Service department 2/3/2017 and they fixed it under warranty.  Skip ahead to 2/26/2018, guess what same issue.  No problem, wait a minute, there are problems.  The service advisor tells me that it is out of the 12 month window so it isn’t covered.  This upsets me a little since we are talking the same month add a few days, but then tells me I have the extended warranty.  Yippie I am all set.  They put me in a loaner.  I am still irked a little because there is a possible 200 deductible.

Skip to the evening.  Service advisor calls and says my Silver warranty doesn’t cover this part.  I am floored.  I cannot understand the logic.  They had me in the service center, knew what they replaced last time, and let me drive away in a loaner just to tell me it isn’t covered.  Then he tells me I have a 140.00 diagnostics charge; I am like what???

Next day I go to return loaner and get my car.  I wanted to see this diagnosis.  You know what it said, Fan needs replaced????  I am paying 140.00 for “Fan needs replaced”. No I wasn’t.  I told them if they want me to pay for a diagnosis it needs to be clear what the issue is.  They send the Director over and I explain to him that I shouldn’t have to pay for a diagnostic charge when it was completed last year.  They should have been able to see what was replaced last year and see if it was covered before ever attempting a “2 hour” diagnosis.

At the end of said poor experience, I went over and requested both of my extended warranties be canceled.  

All of this could of been avoided had they just reviewed the replacement from last year to see if the silver warranty included it.  I would of kept my warranty.  What would of been 600 repair cost loss for them turned into over 2000.00 dollar loss in warranty revenue.  Also not too mention any future purchase from AutoNation.

I suggest anyone looking to buy a new Nissan go to Fenton Nissan.  That’s who I bought from in Oklahoma and they were the best!",1.0
27,"February 19, 2018","The sales manger Rich Lindeman and the car director Vijay Desai are cheaters and not trustworthy. They cut the deal for certain number and to reach that number they delete additional features that they hey have promised during the initial discussion. In the final document you will see the numbers that you have agreed upon but with deletion of additional accessories like wheel locks and so on. if you are not careful in reading the entire document, you will walk away with missing items  on your car which were part of the deal to begin with. I would not recommend this place to buy new cars unless you want to take chance and scratch your head. ",1.0
28,"February 03, 2018",I had bought a truck and they gave me the price. When I got there before signing the contract I caught the numbers didn't add up. They tried to charge me twice for the bed liner and also charged me for wheel locks that come to find out are not even on the truck. The sales guy said they would mail them but guess what I was charged for labor. They also charged me for a service contract and told me if I didn't purchase it my interest rate would be way higher. I was told just to cancel it after 90 days but after reading the contract I can cancel with then 30 days and get a refund. When discussing the price of the extras I was told by the sales manager that I could just walk away from the deal if I didn't like it. I would like to either go to the news or get a lawyer for the false advertisement of the price that clearly states on the website price guaranteed no haggle.. I even have the emails to back everything up. Warning if you buy from the Auto Nation Nissan  check your numbers over and over.,1.6

30,"January 22, 2018","Unless you like being lied to do not even answer a call from this dealership.  I was told on the phone by a sales manager I would be given a certain price on a vehicle.  When I showed up to purchase this vehicle the next day they told me they could not honor that price bc they would lose too much money on the vehicle.  We went back and forth and reached another agreement.  When signing the paperwork I noticed they changed the deal on me again.  Frustrated I asked for the General Manager.  In comes a rude Dustin Osbourne who was involved in the entire process behind the scenes.  He informed me he didn't even want to sell me the car because he was losing too much money.

I waited until it was funded and now they are saying i have to wait 90 days to cancel. I was sold a car with tires that were junk, they let me drive home in the rain with the car knowing the tires were dangerous. They agreed to replace the tires for me,  i had to call the dealer multiple times to get scheduled for my tires to be installed. When i got home from picking up my car after they installed the tires i found all my wheels are scratched and gouged. i have tried to contact Autonation corporate and nobody will help, only refer me back to the dealership.

33,"December 15, 2017","Possibly the worst customer service I've witnessed in my lifetime. My wife's battery died about two years ago and the vehicle wasn't under warranty so we purchased a battery while the vehicle was in for an oil change. Fast forward to this week and the new battery dies and leaves my wife and our infant stranded. I understand it can happen I drive across town to pick them up and I pull the battery out of the vehicle and have the local Autozone test it (which they confirmed bad battery). Since battery is under warranty and was purchased at Autonation Nissan I drive over there expecting to be able to swap the battery out since it was purchased over the counter but instead a policy has been put in place (after we purchased the battery). This new policy doesn't allow the battery to be exchanged unless it is in the vehicle and brought to the dealership, but since the battery was dead the only solution to allow this was to tow the vehicle at my cost in to the dealership, which costs more than the battery is worth... I became upset because this policy is really just setup to keep a person from being able to utilize the warranty on the battery, which is never a problem at parts stores such as Autozone or O'Reillys. During this period of trying to get battery exchanged not a single person was willing to even be understanding regarding the issue. Because of this one visit a 20 year relationship has now ended we have purchased 5 cars and always had them serviced at this location and that has completely ended Autonation will never receive a dime from me ever again. Honestly I hope management reviews the policy and gives their employees some customer service training.",1.0

Ralph-  On the phone prior to our purchase, you assured me that Automation Nissan performed the full maintenance on the vehicle.  The told me that you are not allowed to sell a car unless it was safe to drive.

      The last thing you performed was maintenance or even checked that the car was safe to drive.

      There were no brake pads, the hydraulic fluid was low, the oils was low, the the air filter looks like it had never been changed. The battery was bulging and leaking.  The car also lacked the safety equipment needed to bolt in or raise the jack.   There was just a bolt wrench for the lug nuts and no way to raise the jack.  The alignment was off and we had to replace all four tires.

      My wife went to get the car  with the idea that the car was in working order.  You cost me almost $2k in repairs for work that your company never performed.  If I would have seen how poor of shape the car was in, we would not have purchased the car.  

       In essence, your company lacks integrity and honesty.  I’ll do the vehicle repair work myself but you put my family on the road in an unsafe car and you do bad business by being blatantly dishonest .  You and your company cannot to be trusted.

An IOU was negotiated for minor body work that the NEW vehicle needed, it took 2+ months of calling for then to even acknowledge It. They always had excuses and would push it on different departments.  It took 2 cleanings for them to get it clean enough for us to be willing to take it. They keep forgetting to send out for our actual license plates, so we have had temporary tags since JULY (it's almost October!) They always take 2+ days to email a new temporary tag, since the last one expires, which we then have to drive on expired tags. They don't answer phones, nor return messages.

The guy haggled with me for 30 minutes trying to get me to buy an extended warranty. I finally agreed when he offered me a deal of only $10 more a month for the warranty.  After that, he quickly went thru the paperwork and I was done. After I got home I discovered that he had also added on an extra 3 months of payments to my term without telling me or showing me the paperwork. He had folded those papers up and quickly put them in an envelope without letting me see them. I emailed him to let him know that he had ruined my experience at the dealership and he said the only thing he could do was cancel the warranty and would refund the money to Nissan Finance. He had no remorse for lying and trying to scam me. I then contacted the new car sales manager that I had dealt with. He said that he could cancel the loan and he would get new paperwork drawn up for me to sign. I went back the next day and signed all new paperwork and assumed everything was back to original terms. Fast forward 2 weeks and I receive my first bill from Nissan Finance. Open it up and it shows my payment to be the original deal that the Finance guy had scammed me on. That loan had not been cancelled. Immediately called the new car sales manager and he put me in touch with the Finance Manager. He assured me that he would have the matter taken care of and he gave his ""word"" that he would make it right. Here I am 2 weeks since my conversation with the Finance Manager and nothing has been done to resolve this issue. I have since sent emails and left voicemails to everyone that I dealt with during this process, and none of them will respond. I even left a message with the General Manager, and haven't heard anything back from him. This place is filled with nothing but liars and con men that will try to scam you.

2. Sales manager being sneaky and removing several warranties without my knowledge
3. removal of gap insurance
4. not honoring original contract and rate that they proposed to me and was never really told why it was rejected when I came back to finalize deal
5. inconsideration of my issues and once again finance manager advising me I can leave whenever I want with an Uber or Lyft because he would not request a service person to drive me to my job which is less than 15 miles from the dealership
6. not being contacted from GM- Mr. Osborne with correct info. He stated that he invited for a meeting to review my questions and concerns which he has not. no date or time was given. He also told me that my story is conflicting to what his managers and sales people are saying.  Funny part about this is that they stories that us as consumers/customers are all the same and relate.

49,"July 30, 2017","I specifically got my PRE APPROVAL from Capital One because I didnt want half a dozen different credit inquiries on my Credit Report. I take my finances and credit score very seriously.

So I find the exact vehicle I wanted at Auto Nation Nissan of Lewisville, we agreed on the price and I told them I had my pre approval and all they had to do is call the Capital One 800 number to get an authorization number. And said I DONT WANT MY CREDIT PULLED AGAIN BECAUSE I LIKED MY RATE CAPITAL ONE GAVE ME.

Well I should have known better, they pulled my credit without my authorization to try and offer me a better rate, now I have multiple inquiries on my credit report... Something I specifically didn't want.  If this is the way that Auto Nation, one of if not the largest car dealers in the nation operates then they are no better than 99.9% of the car dealers out there. This is why people usually have a bad taste in their mouths after dealing with dealerships and their finance departments.

So if anyone reads this, I would seriously consider going elsewhere. And if you are in the market for a Chevy or Ford, or a good used vehicle I would highly recommend Holiday Ford Chevrolet in Whitesboro Texas, I have bought most my work vehicles from them and they dont play these games.

51,"July 05, 2017","Stay. Away. Do not walk into this dealership. Honestly, the whole experience was a nightmare. You cannot make this stuff up. Here’s what happened:
1.	Having an Expedition and an F250, my wife and I decided that we would add a fun little convertible to our driveway, and after reading several reviews, we decided on a used Mini Cooper. The vehicle would be for short errands and day road trips, getting around on weekends, and top-down, year-round enjoyment. We live in Texas, after all.
2.	We were drawn to an advertisement for a red, 2006 Mini at AutoNation Lewisville. The price was right, and it came with an extended warranty. We called, made an appointment, and set out on the two-hour drive to the dealership. On the way we called to confirm our credit score. It was/is excellent, well over 700.
3.	We arrived, filled out a credit application, and proceeded to get the round-robin treatment from the sales staff and sales managers. Literally, they’re all the same. Here’s how it worked/works with these people:
a.	I made it clear that I didn’t want a payment over $280, and for no longer than 36 months. By the way, that comes to $10,080, which is not a bad return for the dealership on a car worth, at best, $6,500. My wife and I wanted to maintain cash flow, so we were more than happy to finance and pay the difference.
b.	The salesman said he would go “see what he could do” and left to take the offer to his sales manager. We waited over 10 minutes.
c.	The salesman returns with a counter-offer of $540 per month, for 48 months. I gently reminded him that I would not, under any circumstances, spend a dime over $280/month, for 36 months. I asked him why the figure was so high, and his response was something along the lines of ‘your credit score isn’t so good, financing isn’t cheap, interest, bank fees, etc.’
d.	I suggested that we were in the wrong place and that my credit score was excellent. He then asked if I wanted to make a counter-offer. I said yes. I countered with $279/month for 36 months. He went away and over 10 minutes later a “sales manager” returned and began to lecture us on how the world works and what financing actually entails.
e.	At this point I had had enough. I stood up and told him that I would not be taught life-lessons by a used car saleman, I stated that a $3,500+ profit was more than ample reward for his company’s time and, considering our credit score, I would happily go through my bank and purchase elsewhere. Rudely, he said fine and walked away.
f.	My wife and I walked to our vehicle and began to drive away. The original salesman came running out, apologized profusely, begged us back in, and promised that we would no longer have to deal with that particular sales manager. Reluctantly we returned.
g.	We sat down again, and the salesman said he would take our offer to his boss. Another 10 minutes later he returned, asking if we could put a down payment on the offer of $500. At this point I was outraged. I got up again, but then another sales manager came around the corner. He asked what the problem was, I explained – furiously explained – the situation to him. He asked us to please stay seated and he returned several minutes later saying that they were ready for us in Finance.
h.	In finance we had to continue the haggling for what was close to an addition 45 minutes. It was ridiculous. But you know? At some point you no longer want to walk out. It becomes a matter of principal, pride, and determination. After several back and forth shenanigans, we agreed on $284/month – not my original terms, by my wife said “fine” out of irritation, signed the paperwork, and left. We had a shared feeling of bemused resignation, indignation, relief, and exasperation. Again, you cannot make this stuff up. And that’s how they do it. They beat you up until you finally agree to their terms. The relief you feel is something akin to Stockholm Syndrome, I am sure of it.
BUT THIS STORY ISN’T OVER YET.
4.	We purchased the extended warranty. It wasn’t cheap, but we felt like the protection would be good to have on an 11 year-old vehicle. It came with a $200 deductible. Fair enough.
5.	Two weeks later, the vehicle throws a power steering fan belt. The pump, pulley, and belt need to be replaced. I called AutoNation from the side of the road and asked for a wrecker and additional instructions. Since the vehicle was stalled in Mansfield, I was told a wrecker would be taking it to BMW of Arlington since it was the closest network dealer.
6.	After two weeks, we were called and told the vehicle was ready. And to our surprise, we were told that the deductible was $400, not $200, since we went to an out of network dealership for repairs. That’s irritating, yes, but the worst part is yet to come:
Every time we called AutoNation Lewisville to get resolution, we were either A. hung up on, B. put on hold indefinitely, C. placed in a voicemail loop, or, finally, D. told by the finance department that it was our fault for going out of network. And when I reminded them that THEY TOLD ME WHERE THE CAR WAS GOING, THAT I DID NOT CHOOSE ANYTHING, I was told that they could do nothing for me. When I asked to speak to the GM, I was told he was too busy.
Here’s the deal, if you are a member of ISIS, have lousy credit and zero options due to no income and your status on the FBI’s Top Five Most Wanted List, AutoNation Lewisville may actually be your best bet. But I pray that is not the case. No one, and I mean no one, deserves this kind of treatment. I cannot stress this point enough, and I have actually left out about half of the indignities. Honestly, I have faced enemy combatants in the deserts of the Middle East that I wouldn’t subject to these people and the way they treat customers. And that IS NOT hyperbole.

I even got an invoice from the parts department at the dealership and the part was $68, so they are up charging me almost 300%. This is unacceptable and should be illegal. I take good care of my vehicles and don't mind paying for regular service but there is no way I should be having these issues this soon. They also charge a $149 fee just to look at the car even if there is no repair done.  Also while inspecting under the hood more, it is full of rust. I would absolutely never recommend anyone to buy a car from them or get ripped off at their service department. They left me to drive my 3 kids around in a vehicle I do not feel safe in.",1.2
65,"February 15, 2017","As an out of state buyer, it was a horrific experience. The true nature of vehicle servicing was not disclosed especially after making numerous inquiries therefore left me in a stranded situation in their 2011 BMW X5 35d, 140 miles away. In addition,  I've observed their staff treat customers with contempt and malfeasance. They boast about the thoroughness of their inspection process and servicing requirements prior to bringing their models up for sale. I drove away with the assurance that was the case but just to find out, 160 miles of an approx 745 mile journey that the vehicle emissions sensors went haywire and the car was about to be disabled. Most stressful thing to occur at 7pm at night in the middle of nowhere and then having to limp back to Wichita falls, TX. I paid to tow the vehicle back to the dealership, just to be told by my sales associate, Anthony Ozuna, that the only problem with the vehicle is that it was low on fluids. He had the audacity to tell me it was low on fluids? I thought the car went through your top notch inspection and servicing requirements? Through all of this, there was no apology for my situation and there was  zero involvement with the Sales Manager or had anyone conferred as the credibility of this sales associate story. The dealership honored their money-back guarantee but told me that they can't return my $4k down payment and that I had to wait an additional 10 days for it to process through and then they will cut me a check. So, now, I have no car, I don't have my down payment, and this fiasco costed me $1500 outside of what I had already budgeted for the trip.  Furthermore, I can't buy another car until I get my down payment back. My transportation costs continue to mount as I'm back in colorado springs being victim to taxis, uber, and walking in 20-35 degree weather.

I talked to the manager ""Mr. DJ"". Instead of apologizing, he goes it's a mistake from cooperate and we took all the vehicles off the site in a harsh tone.

67,"January 30, 2017","This past Friday, I had an appointment with a salesman named ""Ken"".  Here is all his information:  Ken O'Donnell, odonnellk3@autonation.com, 972-353-0204, AutoNation Nissan Lewisville
I set up a 7:00 pm appointment to see a used car for my friend and finalize a deal on a new Nissan Murano.  I called him at 6:30 pm to say we were on our way to have both cars up front.  We were both paying cash.  To make a long story short, when we arrived, we were told he was with another client, though there were several salesmen just standing around.  I asked to see the brilliant Ken, as we had a 7:00 appointment.  He came out, introduced himself and said it would just be a few more minutes and had someone else with him.  He then whispered something to him, and told me it would just be a few more minutes.  The other guy then tried to get us to sit in the classic metal chairs, which we did not.  After a while, we were agitated so we went outside as the used car was upfront and unlocked.  We started to look at it and my friend sat inside.  She needed a car for her 17 year old daughter and had never bought a used car before, so I was tying to make this an easy process for her. Then, what a surprise.  The second idiot, who tried to get us to wait, had the new Murano all ready to look at, but then said, I am sorry, but the used car is sold.  Seriously? the classic bait for two ""women"".  I then went back into the dealership and said where is brilliant Ken's office?  They said he was with a client and I said, ""I really did not care"". I then proceeded to his office.  When I stood in the doorway of his office about the size of my hall closet, he looked shocked, and said ""I am with another client"", and I said ""I could care less"".  I proceeded to try to tell this moron that I would not buy that new Murano if he gave it to me . Then two other brilliant idiots asked me to go to another room with them.  I expressed what Ken did, and said they knew zero about ""Sales 101"".  I have been in sales management my whole career.  I then spoke to another AutoNation sales manager at another location, and he said, it is not what it used to be.  These guys are just hourly workers and make very little on a sale.  Quite frankly, I could care less.  Whatever job I have taken on in my life, I put out a 110% and never lied to a client.  You can make a friend in 5 minutes, but if you make an enemy, it would take you forever to win them back.  This Ken idiot, never even had the intelligence to get back with me to apologize, nor even smart enough to make up a story.  All it would have taken was a call when we were on our way to say, ""I am so sorry, but the used car was sold"".  Not this idiot.  He thought I would be so thrilled with the Murano, and you know how dumb women are, he could then not just bait me, hook me and sell me. ",1.0

72,"November 06, 2016","I arrived at AutoNation Nissan in Lewisville this morning for my very first service experience on the Nissan Frontier Pro 4x that I’d purchased a few months back.  This was the worst customer service experience that I’ve ever had.

                The appointment was for a simple oil change and had been scheduled with me by the AutoNation Nissan - Lewisville organization…..I didn’t schedule the appointment.  The service appointment system even sent email reminders of the date and time.  Upon arriving at the dealership, I was asked by Joe Flores in the Service Department if I was going to wait on the vehicle.  I responded that I had planned to wait, since it was just an oil change.  Joe shared that it would be at least 2 hours before my vehicle would be looked at.  I shared with Joe a copy of the appointment that had been made for me by their organization.  Joe shared that these appointments are “mistakes, because no one shows up them”.  My response was that I had, indeed, showed up and driven a half hour to get there.  He said that there was nothing he could do.  I asked to speak with a manager and Joe responded that there was not a manager on premise.

                I then went up front and there was a sales associate at the front desk.  I asked him if there was a General Manager on the premise; he responded that there was not, but did ask if he could assist.  I shared the circumstances above and he did make a copy of my service appointment, but also shared that there was nothing that he could do to assist. 

                A suggestion to this organization is that if your doors are open for business, that you have a manager on the premise at all times who is at least empowered to make basic customer service decisions.

                Bottom line….first service experience attempted with AutoNation Nissan in Lewisville and it was extremely disappointing.",1.3
73,"October 15, 2016","Staff members are friendly and helpful until after you make a purchase. It's hard to get a hold of anyone after.

Do not expect anyone to give you a call/e-mail back. I called the dealership 5 days ago MANY TIMES to see when it was the best time to come in and see Mr. Alvin Baker to cancel an extended warranty. Finally a customer service rep told me she would leave the finance manager a message from me AFTER I had to explain to her many times (and many phone calls) that his extension number does not work because it is ""not recognized"". The voice setting automatically hangs up if you do not know the extension number. I reached out to corporate and even the AutoNation website chat representatives to see if there was a better alternative to make it happen.

4 days later after, I received no call backs as promised. I called many times again and Tatiana transferred me over to the finance department which again did nothing for me because the extension number still did not work. She stopped picking up my phone calls afterwards. I e-mailed Mr. Baker himself and even called the saleswoman (Kassandra) who has nothing to do with cancelling the warranty in hopes of getting something resolved. No call backs.

I gave one last phone call (since customer service stopped answering my calls) and a gentleman in sales said it's better to come in person. At least he was upfront about it. I wish they would have took the time (which only took 30 seconds) to tell me this sooner so I can try to find some time to call off work at one of my 2 jobs ahead of time. Kassandra and Mr. Baker knows I work a tight schedule and work and live about 40 minutes away. This is really an inconvenience.

74,"July 08, 2016","Daughter in college bought her car here 2 years ago.  They day before she drove back to school in January she had the car serviced.  As we were loading the car that evening for the drive back to St. Louis we noticed that the center console had been removed to fix the sport shift button.  Upon replacing the console the mechanic managed to put the cover over a fold up fabric sun shade that normally resides between the passenger seat and the center console.  The plastic cover was actually over the shade with a portion of the shade peeking out, it couldn’t be pulled lose.  The plan was to leave early the next morning but we had to wait until the service center opened to have them fix this problem.  Wasn't happy about our delayed start for an all-day drive.  Today we took the car in for a two year check-up and state inspection.  The car was dropped off at 11:45 and we returned at 5:30.  As we paid we asked about the paperwork for the state inspection and discovered than even though it was written on the intake order it had not been done.  We were asked to wait while it was completed.  I don't appreciate my time being wasted by the service center's lack of attention.  The cashier wasn't very sympathetic, only comment was, ""I don't know what they do back there.""

You apply for credit, nothing is a problem, everything is fine.

That's the bait.

Now the switch. 
You get a call, blaming the banks, they need more collateral, co-signer, more money down, but they are sure you can get it, they let you keep the car for another week.

The accountant puppet is just that, the sales person makes his commission, all lies, all so shady. Then they promise, but never deliver. Just so typical.
I hope everybody knows that the moment you drive a new car off the lot, it doesn't lose value, you just paid the factory profit, the dealership commission, and whatever else they can take you for. Ever wondered why banks only want to finance about 5k less than what you want them to finance?
Cause the car is not worth it, they don't finance factory and dealer profits.

Of course, you can always return the car, that's when things get nasty. All of a sudden, nobody is your friend anymore. The accountant puppet has no time, the sales guy has this gleam in his eye, the Manager ""turned his smile upside down"".

79,"January 03, 2016","I dealt with ""Taylor"" the sales manager and a newly hired sales person - John (who was a very good.) After arriving at the dealer at 9:30 AM and having my vehicle appraised and test driving a car, I finally settled on a vehicle. I offered to pay the asking price after I renegotiated the value of my trade and was turned over to the finance manager who then proceeded to ask me to pay MORE THAN WHAT I AGREED TO.

Evidently the TEXAS PROTECTION PACKAGE TOTALING MORE THAN $700.00 was added to the invoice. I told ""Taylor"" THAT I WAS NOT going to pay for the additional amount and requested he give me back the keys to my trade. 

""Taylor"" basically refused until I became belligerent. Taylor stated that the asking price on the car was less than what he owned it for... I told him that if he did not want to sell me the car (for the asking price WITHOUT the PROTECTON PACKAGE) that was his choice and I would buy a car elsewhere. I asked for the keys to MY CAR so I could leave. He refused to give me back my keys so I could leave. This exchange took more than 15 minutes and me literally having to yell at him... 

""Taylor"" finally gave in after I stood my ground and refused to pay the additional $700. I was already at the dealership for more than 3 hours. 

The ironic part is THE TEXAS PROTECTION PACKAGE WAS NOT EVEN INSTALLED ON THE CAR! I asked the salesman what comes with it and he said wheel locks, tinting the windows and some kind of body-side molding. NONE OF THESE are on the car.

BOTTOM-LINE:  Buyer Beware... this is the most unscrupulous car dealer I have ever dealt with.

POST SCRIPT: I recently took the vehicle in for service at another Nissan Dealer and was told that the vehicle suffered rear-end damage (the bumper had been damaged and poorly repaired) and the front suspension had been damaged.  The vehicle also had to have new control arms, struts and bearings replaced and there was an open recall. Please note this was a CPO vehicle/CarFax certified and Autonation claims that they do not sell cars with open recalls. Evidently they mislead the public in their advertising and when they deal with customers directly. Nissan should revoke their franchise.

Lady I spoke to said there would be no reason why you couldn't. I then drove over an hr to go look at the car. It was great. Nothing at all mechanically could we find to be wrong and other than the DVD player didn't work in the interior we were ready to purchase. Went inside where they then informed us we were actually paying 700$ more for some stupid carpet/upholstery warranty we would never use but they charge it standard on top of the amount of the vehicle. We still agreed, get the loan set up, even know when our first payment will be due, give down payment. Then they say it needs to pass state inspection and their little inspection (which they were supposed to run BEFORE offering it to be sold), give it an oil change & it would be ready. Well, it was on a Friday and the mechanic was on his way out. Didn't want to make a mechanic mad and my kids were getting restless so we decided to come back the next day & get it. We waited for the call on Saturday to come pick up the car. There wasn't one so we called around 1 and got the run around till 4 when they informed us we could NO LONGER BUY IT!!! They said it needed a transmission. If we still wanted it they wouldn't go down on the price but they would do the work and we would have to pay for that too even though when we looked at it for that price we were under the impression we were buying a car with a good transmission. My husband who is EXTREMELY knowledgeable and has been working on cars for many many years believes that was complete BS. There was nothing wrong with the way it was shifting and with only 100k miles there's no way nothing more than a solenoid would need to be changed if anything especially with the type of transmission it has. we then got the run around again when they said they would over night a check on Monday.

Please read the reviews on yelp and dealerrater and you will see. I'd say the majority of these reviews saying how excellent they are are fake. The customer service after the sale and wait times in the service dept are horrible!!! Chances are very likely you'll be disappointed doing business with this dealer. And if you do, get any and all promises about any fixes in writing and signed by a manager who has the authority to make such promises. Do not believe anything they tell you by mouth!!!",1.4

92,"August 27, 2015","My first experience with service at this dealership was for a transmission issue on a 2014 Pathfinder. The service rep (Duante) felt he should talk over the customer as I was trying to explain the issue I was having with MY vehicle. Terrible customer service however if you read the responses on here, seems to be the nature of how they treat all of their customers.

My second trip to this dealership for service occurred on 8/26/15 when I dropped off the same 2014 Pathfinder for once again Transmission issues. I dropped the car off at 10:00 AM and received a call from Duante at 12:00 PM stating they would need the car until tomorrow which was no issue. However, this morning 8/27 at 8:30 AM i get a call from Nate saying they have LOST the keys to my car. How in the xxxx do you loose the keys to a customers car. In hind-site when the reason from the call at 12:00 PM the day before stating they would need the car longer was due to the fact they could not find the keys. And instead of stating that at that time, they felt that keeping my car for a full day and perform absolutely no work on it was no big deal to them. Nate was simply saying they needed to program a new key however they need me to bring them my other key in order to do that. 
Chuck the service director, whom I also spoke with after my initial visit to this dealership for service and told me at that time he had only been at the dealership for a short time and he was brought in to ""FIX"" things. Let me tell you Chuck, you are doing a TERRIBLE job if one of the most simple things your department has to do is move a clients car from the service drive to the first parking spot outside of the drive and within that 50 feet, your employees loose a clients key.

I will not be back to this dealership for anything in the future and that includes purchasing a vehicle. There are thousands of dealerships in the DFW area and I know for a fact that NONE of the ones I have ever done business with have had such a poorly run, dysfunctional service department. Take your time and money somewhere else.",1.0

95,"June 06, 2015","On 6/1 my granddaughter purchased a used car from AutoNation Nissan--a 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee for $4991.  The price was fair and she liked the car so we asked the salesperson to work up the ""drive out"" price (tax, title, license, document and inspection fees).  
She presented us with a figure of $6300. Knowing that the tax, title, license, and fees should be around $400-$500 we knew something was amiss?  Upon closer examination we saw a $699 ""appearance package"" had been added, without any discussion, to the proposal.  We indicated that the ""appearance  package"" was not wanted and requested a new proposal emphazing that the maximum amount that could be spent was $5500. 
The salesperson took the rejected proposal to her manager and returned with a new  figure of $5800.  Now you do not have to be smarter than a fifth grader to know if you take away $700 from $6300 you get $5600.  
It was then that we stood up and walked out the door.  Before we had made 10 steps the manager came out and asked us to come back in and we could have the car for $5500.  
So how was the $5800 price arrived at? Was the $700 package being sold for $300 or was $300 simply added to the selling price? 
For the record, AutoNation dealerships explored on the market by buying old well-established honest/ethical businesses.  It has taken a while but the corporate culture of greed has taken hold.

96,"June 05, 2015","We decided to have the vehicle towed to Nissan of Lewisville, because this location was closer to our house.  The vehicle was delivered to them on February 4, 2015.  My service advisor at this location was Nate Banks.  The Lewisville store finally told me my fuel pump needed to be replaced.  I agreed to have this work done.  I also agreed to have the oil cooler O-ring replaced because it was leaking.   I picked my vehicle up on February 6, 2015 and paid $1196.63. 
 I had to take my vehicle back to Nissan within a week due to gasoline pouring from the bottom as I was pumping gas.  They informed me that a bolt was not accurately secured when the fuel pump was installed.  They tightened everything up and my car was delivered back to me.  I drove my car for a few weeks, but it was exhibiting the same symptoms as before.  I called Nate and scheduled an appointment to take my car back.  On April 10, 2015 my car was diagnosed and I was told my starter needed to be replaced.  I agreed to have the work performed and was able to pick my vehicle up on April 15, 2015 and paid $701.22.  
I was back at Nissan on April 24, 2015 because my vehicle was exhibiting the same symptoms.   I was told they were going to perform a recall that was previously done on my vehicle to fix the issues I was having.   After they performed the recall, I was called to pick up my vehicle, but was unable to pick it up that day because someone hit it.  They fixed the bumper and I was told I could pick up the vehicle the following day.  I was not able to pick up my vehicle on this day due to it presenting the same symptoms as before.  I requested to speak with the manager, because I feel that I have paid money for trial an error fixes.  I spoke with Chuck Peretti, the service director, and he informed me that he knew about my situation and had driven my car to try and figure out what was going on.  He finally experienced the symptoms I was complaining about.  They kept my vehicle for a while, continuing to work on finding the problem.  I spoke to Nate on May 15 and he told me my car was throwing a NAT code.  He asked me if I had additional keys and I told him yes. I was told that one code leads to another code and another and the repairs could get very costly and he was suggesting I trade my vehicle in if it continues to act up.   I took the keys to Nissan and was told they needed to be reprogrammed.  During the time of the reprogramming of my keys, I stopped by to talk to Chuck again.  I asked him if it was safe to say, that this final finding was the problem all along.  He told me that my fuel pump was bad, because it did not exhibit the correct PSI numbers.  I have yet to be given the paperwork showing the findings of the low PSI readings.  He went on to explain that a starter or a fuel pump will not throw a diagnostic code.  I informed him that I do not mind paying for services that are needed, but did not want to pay for trial and error items.  I feel that I have been xxxxx and forced to pay for things that did not need to be fixed.  My vehicle was delivered to me today May 23, 2015.  I spoke with Chuck again today to try and recoup some of the money I have spent.  He told me all the items repaired were bad, but I don’t believe that.  When I asked him about the PSI readings from my fuel pump, he told me that information is not automatically recorded because the readings are performed on a hand-held device.  He was not there when the test was performed and could not give me the information I asked for.  I asked him do they physically document the findings, and he said they may have but he was not sure.   I find all of this to be unacceptable and unfair.   It leads one to believe they are being cheated.

98,"March 20, 2015","If I could give a ""zero"" star rating, I would. I have never had worse customer service or have been disrespected more than this place of business. My husband and I went in for an incredibly priced used vehicle. The salesman we worked with was friendly and helpful. However, we knew more about the vehicle than him. We asked how they could get such a new car, for such a good price, he did not have an answer. The salesman did not disclose to us that the car has been in a ""moderate"" accident. After the extended test drive we did, we ran into many problems with the vehicle. We decided to return it. At the time of return we worked with sales manager, Taylor. First, we explained the issue with the vehicle and he said ""let me have our service team check it out."" I responded with ""you can have your team do whatever you need, however, we are not taking that car home today. We have decided against it."" Taylor immediately got an attitude with me and said ""you can be polite to me."" Which, started to set me off. Taylor then argued with my husband and I about how it was ""strange"" and he was hesitant to take the car, despite the fact that we never signed the loan or our e-check from our auto lender. He ended up having to get his manager involved, who was also rude. I believe his name was Mark. He excused Taylor after he called me an idiot in the facility. Mark refused to take care of the customers, despite the fact that we came in more than willing to spend our $30,000 car loan on a different vehicle. A business that employs such rude associates does not deserve our business. I even called the auto nation customer service line to let corporate know of the incident, and the Texas line never called back. Unsatisfied with this business. Will not be working with this dealer ever again. ",1.0
99,"March 14, 2015","I am the type of person that NEVER writes a review but I feel that this car buying experience is worth a review. I have been a victim of identity theft for the past few years so to say the least my credit is not great(mid to upper 500's) so I knew that my situation was going to be a challenge. I already had two open auto loans(one car a Mazda 6 that will be paid off in about 6 months and the other car a Chrysler 200 I have leased for the last past year but the car payment was outrageous $237 every two weeks). The challenge is that the lease could be returned early but I would need a car before I returned the lease. I tried Cental Kia Lewisville(rude finance peolple, dont waste your time)and Huffies Chevrolet Lewisville(Oscar(sales)were nice but no bank would approve me there). I knew that I wanted a Nissan and that I lived near Lewisville but nothing else so I Goggled reviews on yelp and other sites and ran across Autonation Nissan Lewisville. The reviews had me torn because I saw so many negative reviews and not many positive BUT the positive reviews that I did see had one factor in common Ken O'Donnell so I decided to give Autonation a try BUT I was only going to work with Ken. I went to the dealership(on my lunch break) to speak with Ken, I told him all of the cars that I thought was in my price range explained my situation and he told me that he would do what he could to help(I left all documents, paycheck stubs, current lease agreement, tax return, etc) and I went back to work. When I got off, I went to see Ken and test drove a Nissan Altima that I wanted. Ken stated that they would submit to bank for approval. Next day, received a text from Ken asking what car note payment do I want to stay under? I told him no more than $380 a month. I didn't hear anything else from Ken that day. The next day, I received a text stating that he haven't forgotten me just waiting for the bank approval. Later that day(after work around 6pm) went to dealership to check status. Ken told me that my situation is a little difficult simply because based on my credit and the fact that I already have two open auto loans bank are reluctant because even though my plan is to return the leased car, the banks are looking at debt to income and other factors to determine if I could afford a third car note just in the event that I planned to keep the 200. I was sad to hear the bad news(another year of a high lease payment) so with my head hanging low, I told Ken thanks for trying and was getting ready to accept that there was no chance for my situation when Ken told me BUT. BUT(the greatest word I have ever heard)he told me that honestly I could get approved but either I was going to need more than a $1500 down payment, pick an older Altima which would have a lot more miles on it or I had to pick a smaller car than an Altima. He told me that one bank is interested but that those were the terms. So honestly I was a little sad my heart was set on this 2012 Altima but Ken told me that even with the unfavorable credit I have excellent car payment history on both cars and that is why the bank might be willing. I told Ken that I would trust his judgment on what is a good car for me since he has been selling cars for 16 years but I didn't want anything too small. He told me to give he a day to have his finance team( Alvin, Mike and Shelly all great by the way)to work on the deal. I left, I wasn't the happiest but I honestly was thankful truly thankful that Ken didn't give up on me nor my situation and at that point I just prayed and simply stated whatever is in the Lords’ will let it be done. The next day, I really didn't hear much. Ken did check in like he did everyday but I don't know, he told me that they were working on it but I wasn't that hopeful and then I received a text from Ken asking me if I was stopping by and I told him yes. I made it to the dealership and he smiled a little and asked if I wanted to take my new car on a test drive? New car? Test Drive? He took me to an all Black 2012 Nissan Sentra. When I looked at it, I thought it was too small and I guess Ken saw it on my face but he smiled again and stated drive it before you shoot it down. I got in and was surprised that it was actually bigger on the inside then I thought. Ken stated running down the features(certified, Carfax, 44,00 miles, 3 day money back guarantee, 100,000 miles warranty, gap insurance included, no car payment for roughly 2 months, and that the car note would be right under $380). It has been 2 days since the purchase and honestly with my situation I KNOW that I wouldn't have gotten a better deal. My name is Ideshia Taylor and if you are looking for a low mile dependable car, I would honestly tell you to go to Autonation Nissan Lewisville and tell Ken O'Donnell that I referred you and he will definitely take great care of you. If Autonation Nissan can't get you approved then it can't be done!!!!!!                      ",5.0

101,"November 10, 2014","I finally got fed up with them and paid out-of-pocket to get my brakes fixed!  For over two years I had brought my 2010 Rouge back for pulsating and noisy brakes (10/2011, 1/2012, 4/2013, 10/2013, 12/2013).  The 2nd  to last visit, they resurfaced my front rotors; yet didn't bother replacing the brake pads.  Not only did my brakes continue to pulsate, I had a very, very loud squeal.

The last time I brought it back, I was advised by the Service Manager, they couldn't identify a problem, yet, everyone in the Service Center could hear the squealing when I pulled out and pulled back into the Service Center.  This was the day the 2013 Dallas Area Ice Storm hit, so I advised my Service Manager I'd be back again.  I didn't have time to argue since I needed to travel 40 miles to get home.  With that, I couldn't deal with them anymore and brought it to a local mechanic.  The mechanic easily identified both the front and back rotors were warped.  

With all five visits to AutoNation (Lewisville, TX), no one even bothered to look at the rear braking system.  I conclude their mechanics aren't qualified, or they didn't want the cost on their books!  ",1.0
102,"July 01, 2014","I went in last October to trade in my nissian altima for a nissan rogue because I was told they would forgive the destination charge and mileage overage. THAT IS THE ONLY REASON I CHOSE TO STICK WITH NISSAN. I had my parents with me to make sure I wasn't being taken advantage of but somehow Nissan still screwed me over. I leased my nissan in Santa Monica, then moved to Texas and wanted to trade it in. I went to Nissan of Lewisville and it was stated several times that the mileage would be forgiven as part of the deal. Everything was great and we had no problems, until 9 months later I started getting contacted by a collection agency stating I owed Nissan Santa Monica $2,021.72 for my overage in mileage. All of this is due to the fact that Nissan of Lewisville did not keep their word, and apparently their own finance offices don't talk to each other. I submitted a change of address form at the office in Lewisville, who apparently never submitted the change to Santa Monica Nissan. The Loss and Recovery team informed me of that today when I called inquiring about the collections calls. I tried to get to the bottom of the situation but when I tried to contact Kavon, the salesman who sold me my car, he is no longer working there. Convenient. We then tried talking to the manager, who said he wasn't aware of our complaint, but had nothing stating our mileage would be forgiven. We have been given the run around from both Nissan dealerships and are extremely disappointed with the way everything was handled. I'd like to turn in my Nissan early and walk away from the whole deal, but heaven forbid Nissan do the right thing. As a young adult trying to make good credit for myself, I'd like to thank Nissan for royally screwing it up. NEVER BUYING A NISSAN AGAIN!",2.2

105,"August 28, 2013","I don’t normally write bad reviews…only good ones however I have to warn others that might be in the same position as we were.  On a Saturday evening around 630pm, we went to AutoNation Lewisville to look at a pre-owned Hyundai Elantra that I had seen online.  When we got there, a salesman approached us however when I asked about the Elantra he had no idea where it was.  After disappearing for a few minutes he came back and said that it must’ve been under a deal because they had pulled it and taken it to one of their partner lots.  There were a few other used cars there within our price range, but I really wanted to test drive an Elantra.  I am always afraid of getting a salesman that is too pushy however ours was just the opposite.  He was very stand-offish and didn’t say very much.  Normally sales people talk to you about the cars and about their features however he wasn’t saying anything.  As we were getting ready to leave, he looked on the computer and found a used Elantra at one of their other lots.  We followed him there and I drove the Elantra back.  I was really pleased with the vehicle so we asked him to run some numbers.  I was VERY upfront with him about the fact that we had a trade, would not be doing a down payment…no matter what.  We were not desperate for a new car, it was just something we wanted to do.  After getting our information he disappeared again for what seemed like 45 minutes.  When he came back he had the trade appraisal for our car which was much less than what the KBB value was showing and they wouldn’t budge on it. His paper listed a hefty down payment and the payment was about $100 more a month than what I asked for.  We also take our car notes 72 months but he told us there aren’t many lenders who will do that.  Which, I’ve never heard of before. 

He said that since it was late, no lenders would be available to help us (which I know is bullcrap, we’ve always bought cars in the later evening hours) and that he would call me on Monday morning with what he was able to come up with.  I think he just wanted to go home and we were inconveniencing him.  Monday morning came and went, no calls.  I called him, no answer – left voicemails.  I emailed him twice, no answer. I emailed the dealership manager Paul, no response.  The reason I was trying to rush it along was that I had found an Elantra at a different dealership that I wanted to check out in the event this wasn’t going to work out.  Finally around 430pm I get a call from someone else at the dealership asking if all of our questions were answered.  What??  Umm, no…your salesman never even called back.  Then he said he would find out and call me back.  No call.  I finally called that particular guy back, no answer so I left a voicemail.  Then someone DIFFERENT called me at around 530pm quoting me another sky high payment amount and said that NO LENDER would accept that payment amount with zero down (we still owed a bit on the trade) and when I asked about upping the trade value to make up for it, he just completely ignored what I said and kept talking.  Said he was sorry that they couldn’t help us and that was it!

2 days later we visited Van Hyundai in Carrollton. Found a newer, bigger, more luxurious car (Sentra) with more features and less miles at a lower price!  The staff there was great, helpful and attentive.  Worked a deal with no money down, paid off our trade and adjusted the price of the car and the interest rate to come within a couple of dollars of where we needed the payment.  AND this was around 830pm at night when supposedly no lenders are available (per the guy at AutoNation)???  Hmph.  A 72 month note no problem with Capital One.  

If you are looking for a car, avoid AutoNation Nissan unless you are paying cash, have a hefty down payment or have above perfect credit – so that they don’t have to do any work for you – because obviously they don’t want to lift a finger to do anything.  Oh, and go in the morning because their sales people don’t like to stay up past their 8pm bedtime.  Van Hyundai went above and beyond; they got our business along with the business of friends and family who I will refer to them in the future.  The day after we purchased at Van Hyundai, I had an email in my inbox from our disappearing AutoNation sales guy that said “would you consider a Sentra?”.  Ugh, really?

We were very fortunate to find a wonderful replacement on the lot at 7:30 PM. Unfortunately, since we had already purchased the other car, the transaction in finance could not be done that late in the evening. To avoid the possibility of the replacement car being sold the next day, Michael suggested we take the car home with us that evening.

My Dad who is 79 was looking for a used car and we found one on autotrader.com that was exactly what he had been looking for.  I saw that it was listed at Bankston Nissan so I knew it would be somebody we could trust.  I called on Saturday 5/12 and was put in touch with Gil. I asked if the car was still available and he told me it was in the body shop getting a minor repair but would be out early the next week.  He took my name and number.  First thing Monday morning, he called just to follow up to let me know he would keep in touch about the car and it would be out Wed. morning.  On Wed. 5/16, he called to let me know the car was available and I told him I would send my Dad in to look at it.  He took the time to take down my Dad's name and phone number and said he would be available to help him.  I just got a call from Gil and my Dad just drove away happy in his ""new"" 2003 Nissan Altima.  Gil was so complimentary of my Dad and was such a nice guy to work with.

125,"April 18, 2012","I gave Bankston Nissan in Lewisville a ""5"" rating because they provide great customer service.  I just leased my third Nissan Murano SL from Bankston Nissan in Lewisville.  I was so happy with the service I received from Jon Deter in 2009, that I sought him out when I was looking at the 2012 Nissan Murano SL.  Jon is low key, extremely knowledgeable and is willing to take the time to go through all the features of each vehicle.  Shopping for a new car is sometimes painful, but Jon makes it a pleasant experience, from beginning to end.   Great customer service begins with Paul Francis, the Executive Manager, and resonates throughout the whole dealership, including Rodger Salsman in the Service Department.

They offered me a price at 17.99% and I said do it!  I need to establish credit.  Joshua said he would get back with me on the financing.  3 e-mails and 2 voicemails later Joshua responded with ""I will get back to you when I get an approval.....I still have not heard from him.

133,"October 20, 2011","I had a mixed experience for Bankston.  The car I attempted to purchase was a 2012 Nissan Versa, and what has become apparent, they are somewhat hard to find and they sell quickly.  Doug informed me that Bankston did not have a 2012 Versa sedan in stock; however, he went on to say that he could get one from another nearby sister dealership.  After waiting for 2 days, Doug failed to return my call, even after I left him a message on two separate occasions.  After 3 days, I finally received a phone call from Doug thanking me for my patience.  He then told me what he could get me another Versa from yet another dealership the next morning.  That morning, I waited for Doug's phone call and it never came.

Frustrated, I took my business to Texas Nissan in Grapevine where several Versa's were in stock.  After selecting my vehicle, I showed the salesman, Nathan Glass, the quote I had received from Bankston.  Nathan gave me an additional $250 for my trade-in; $700 off of the price of the Versa; and an additional .75% off of the interest rate.  If Dough Mcantosh was more astute about answering his phone calls, this mess would have been subverted.  That being said, Dough Mcantosh did work hard to get the vehicle I wanted from other dealerships, and for that reason only, I give him 5 stars for quality of work and 5 stars for friendliness.

In addition to Paul's attention to our needs, Joe Flores, Service Manager at Bankston in Lewisville is truly an excellent Service Manager.  Joe and his service team have diagnosed and resolved problems that we had no idean would be an issue with our Nissans.  As technology changes and makes our vehicles more technically adapt, Joe Flores and his team, including Paul Berry, Service Advisor, have provided the highest level of service excellance one could expect.  We were previously committed to a different type of automobile.  However, after our two Maxima's, three Altima's and one Versa, we are committed Nissan customers going foward.  Over the last 5 years, we have had only two service issues that were more than a normal oil and filter change.  Joe Flores made sure we had transprotation while our Nissans were updated with the most current technology requirements and the service team knew exactly how to adjust the issues with our Nissans in a very timely and efficient manner.

155,"November 01, 2010","On 10-22-10 me and my wife headed out to buy a new nissan maxima. We live near McKinney, Texas so we headed to Nissan of McKinney. I was approached by a salesman and told him ""i'm going to make it easy on you, my wife is going to buy a new maxima today, i have no trade in and i will pay cash"". We looked at several Maximas, teat drove one and my wife ended up finding one on the showroom floor that she wanted. The 2011 Maxima, sport version. I told the salesman that i needed an out the door price, because i was going to head over to Bankston Nissan in Lewisville and check their prices on the same car. The salesman went to his boss and they came back with a written offer and they wanted me to stay there and make the deal. I told them that i had helped my daughter purchase a 2010 Pathfinder several months ago and i had dealt with Paul at Bankston and i thought we had made a real good deal, so i felt i needed to at least try one other dealership.We left McKinney Nissan and drove over to Bankston in Lewisville, i spoke with Paul and he directed us to a young salesman, named Colby. I told Colby and Paul that we had just left McKinney Nissan and i had a written offer in my hand for a Maxima that my wife picked out. Paul looked at the build sheet on the car she wanted and he advised that he didn't have one on his lot but he found one at the dealership in Farmers Branch and he would send someone to go get it. About thirty minutes later the car arrived at the dealership and we made sure that it compared to the maxima in McKinney. The only difference in the vehicles was that the McKinney car had tinted windows and pinstripes (which i didn't like), and the Lewisville car had splash guards and trunk organizer. I told Colby and Paul, ""cash deal no trade in"", and i need an out the door price. Paul came back with an offer that was $1380.00, less than the McKinney price. I called the Mckinney dealership back, like i told them i would and tryed to talk to my salesman. I called the cell phone number on the business card he gave me and the number had been disconnected. I called the main number and ask for my salesman and the receptionist said that he no longer worked there! I advised the receptionist that i had just talked to him an hour ago and again she advised that he had quit last week. I ask to talk to his boss and and after talking to the manager, i learned that my salesman had quit but he had come back to work that day and his phone wasn't connected yet. I finally talked to my salesman and told him that Bankston had beat his price by nearly fourteen hundred dollars, he yelled to his manager about the price and he came back on the phone and said ""come back over and we can do that deal for the same price!"". I ask him why i should come back over when i gave him every chance to make the deal while i was there.I know the dealership is in the business of making money and i am in the business to buy a car as cheap as i can. I told Paul that McKinney offered to make the same deal and he agreed with me that they had a chance to make the deal and they missed out.Needless to say we puchased the new car at Bankston and Paul even threw in a window tint job for no extra charge. That's two new cars i have purchased from Bankston Nissan and its a relief when you walk out the door and feel that i have shopped smart and did my best to make a good deal and feel like the dealership has bent over backwards to get my business. I highly recommend Bankston Nissan for any new car purchase and dealing with Paul and his staff is actually fun and that usually can't be said about new car buying.

This dealership is unlike any dealership I've got a vehicle from in the past.  They were upfront with me about what was included in my payments and they were upfront from the start.  They didn’t do the back and forth stuff that most dealerships do and they provided EXCELLENT customer service.

I have never wrote a review about any car dealership before but these guys did such an amazing job and really helped me out! I can't thank them enough for helping me.

157,"September 04, 2010","My wife and I had been looking for a nice used Armada LE with a nice choice of options when we located one that meet our standards at Bankston Nissan of Lewisville. 
   I reached out via Email to Jon Deter and let him know that we were interested and wanted to setup an appointment to come see the vehicle. Mr. Jeter responded quickly and let us know that it was still available and setup our appointment. 
   I let Mr. Jeter know exactly what I was trying to do and he was more then confident that he could make everything happen. My wife and I had 2 lease vehicles coming to term and I wanted to see what I could get for them. Jon had both appraised and offered us exactly what we wanted for our cars. I asked if I could take the Armada home for the night and let my wife test drive it and see how we like it. Jon didnt think twice about the request, he gave us the keys, gave us a full tank of gas, and sent me on my way. 
Heres where Bankstons amazing customer service started to shine!  
   My wife was 9 months preggo at the time, of all things Texas was nailed by 10+ inches of snow over 3 days, and we had our son on Feb 12th while still being in possession of the Armada that I scheduled a 1 night test which turned into 4 days. Mr. Deter and everyone at Bankston was completely understanding and let us keep the car until released from the hospital with our new son in his new car seat install in the borrowed Armada.  Never once did Bankston Nissan of Lewisville or Mr. Deter rush us to get back in. 
   We arrived back to Bankston Nissan of Lewisville with the Armada and our entire family almost an entire 7 days after our initial visit  to finish the process where Jon still amazed us. While we were in finance Jon filled the Armada up with a 2nd full tank of gas and had the car completely detailed before we were out of the absolutely fasted Financing process I had every been through. 
  We were never forced or asked to purchase anything that I didnt personally ask about. They even beat our pre-approved interesting from USAA. 
   Hands down this was the greatest car purchasing experience of both my Wife and I's life and has provoked us to only work with Jon Deter at Bankston Nissan of Lewisville.

They will leave you waiting for long periods of time while they ""check"" on things. The time was enough for me to think through the purchase I was about to make and I decided to leave. The finance guy I dealt with was very shady and tried to rope me into a very high finance rate. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this dealership. Also, beware that this dealership has a huge problem with squirrels. Many new vehicles at the dealership have had wires chewed through by squirrels.",1.0
159,"July 01, 2008","DONT EVEN THINK!!! of going to these piece of junkies, i was out there last night to buy a 09 Murano from them on an agreed upon price, I had told them that i have my financing in place and wasn't interested in financing from them.

When i got there, i told them to do the buyers agreement and be done with it, the Sales Man (Mark Roberts) came up with a junk piece of paper which listed the Vehicle price without VIN# on it and financing rates and told me that it is the Buyer's contract (Duh). 

They were also forcing me to sign another piece of paper saying that it will be used for O.F.A.C and wanted me to put my S.S.N and all other information on it. that piece of paper was to run my credit history. 

I did not sign any of the papers and they kept delaying the process. I finally stood up and started to walk when one of their other LIEnance officer (Ryan or Bryan i do not remember exactly, but he looked like a RAT with the spikes on his head) took us to his office explaining me why they need the S.S.N and other information on the sheet that they provided me. i refused to provide the information again when he said, OKAY i will be back. He walked out keeping the speaker phone on so that they could hear us talking. HOW CHEAP.


Anyways i spent worthless 2 hours at their dealership. These guys are bunch of Cheaters and will lie to sell their car. They have no ethics.

Do yourself a favor and find a better dealer and do read Jeff's www.carbuyingtips.com, i feel good that i didn't fall in their trap.

160,"August 22, 2006","This is one of the most pleasant dealer visits I've ever had.  I am a Nissan customer for life (but only for Bankston Nissan Lewisville).  These guys worked hard to give me the deal I wanted and treated me like royalty.  Everyone was friendly and there was nothing ""fishy"" about them (the way I usually feel about other dealerships).  The day after I got my car (took my car home at night), I noticed a little scratch.  When I took my car up there, they took it right in and gave me a rental car.  Now that is what defines a good dealership from a bad one.  These guys are honest, hardworking, and treat you the same way everytime you call or go up there as you do the very first time you walked in.  They gave me what my trade-in was worth, and I will recommend these guys to everyone!!

FYI - that was for my car.  We purchased my husband's at North Texas Nissan in Corinth, TX.  Do NOT buy a car from them.  They are scandilous, lying, inexperienced theives who only care about commission.  Yes, we bought a car from them, but when we got home we realized we had been lied to about many different things (warranty, the brand new car had a replaced engine by Nissan - which may have been okay if they had told us about it prior to our getting home).  The  brand new Altima they sold us had scratches and they took forever to acknowledge the situation and denied us a loaner car!  They roped us into an extended warranty and didn't tell us this car already had one due to a replaced engine.",4.8
