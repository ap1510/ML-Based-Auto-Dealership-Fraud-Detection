I have never felt more disgusted in my life! This is our second issue with the service department at Aztenhoffer.  First issue they let my 2019 Chevy  Silverado go on the road missing a lug-nut after a tire rotation. We took the vehicle back in and they had to order us new ones. Putting my families life in danger every day it was out on the road. I took my vehicle in for a recall on the brakes 12/30 and while I was there I asked for the full maintenance service. Which would require them to check my brakes again, oil change, battery, etc. I pick up my vehicle thinking it’s good and ready. A week later 1/9 my husband is driving my truck with my 2 babies and the brakes go out at the light of HEB plus on Navarro! Luckily he reacted in the safest way and no one was injured. He took the vehicle back to the dealership. The lady at the desk said it was a vacuum filter that caused this and that when they serviced our vehicle they did not touch that part. Which made no sense. Any how I knew she was not a tech so I waited till the next day to speak with management. When I call first thing in the AM service management Allen is acting as if he has no idea what is wrong with my vehicle. Even after I begin to tell him what the lady at the desk told us. He says she had no idea what she was talking about and should not had said anything to us. He said he would call me back ... yea that never happened. I called the General Manager Tommy Taylor. He listened and I felt as if he was helpful at first. He said he would call me back after he found out what was wrong. Never got that call back. I called back after lunch left him a voicemail. Still no phone call back. Well I was heated by this point. After work I rushed down to the dealership. Talked to Tommy and then he lies to me telling me I did not take my vehicle in for the brake recall. He said the Bulletin  wasn’t posted till January 6th”. So I thought okay I might have made a mistake. The truck is still with their service department because they said it’s my battery!  I was not about to bring it home. They changed out my battery and I’m furious at this point. I still have their loaner. When I get home I find my invoice and it states I took my vehicle in for the brakes malfunction recall and other recalls. So first TOMMY TAYLOR LIED TO ME IN MY FACE. This could have been fatality just because my family wasn’t in a car accident doesn’t make this right! I called right back but Tommy Taylor was already gone for the day. I was transferred to another manager because I did not want to talk to Allen obviously he doesn’t know what he’s talking about. I get transferred to a different manager who was very understanding. This made me feel so much better. Now this manager told me he was going to find some answers for me and he would call me back. I’m glad he did call me back. I told him my frustrations with Tommy Taylor for lying. He said it might have been miscommunication within the management.. well like I told him that’s not my fault. His management at the service department was probably trying  to cover it up so he wouldn’t get chewed by Tommy Taylor. Putting Tommy Taylor as a liar to the customer. Now I ended up calling GM to ask questions and file a complaint on this dealership. When I tell them what’s going on they are in complete shock! Because the computer does say they completed the brake malfunction recall on the 12/30 when the recall was sent out 12/12. GM says what happened to my husband would not have happened. Because the recall had already been performed. So Aztenhoffer service department is getting complacent and are not completing the task as they are suppose to. My husband was in the incident 1/9. But according to Tommy Taylor the bulletin wasn’t posted till 1/6. GM personally told me there has not been anything posted since 12/12 for my vehicle. They told me that dealership is covering up something they did wrong. I am disgusted by this dealership. We pay a lot of money on our vehicle and for it not to be liable. We are getting a second opinion with a nearby dealership because we do not trust the service here at Aztenhoffer. Please do not take your vehicles there you do not know the kind of quality you are getting. I wish we would have read the reviews on this dealership before trusting them with ours. My families life’s matter! You matter! Don’t take your vehicle somewhere they can careless about you. Think twice before taking your vehicle to a dealership with no respect for your life or your families life. ",1.0
1,"September 10, 2018","I have just purchased my second vehicle from the Atzenhoffer dealership and I have worked directly with Jeff Smith each of these times.  Never has anyone been such a JOY to work with.  Many times, women shopping for a new vehicle get the ""runaround"" and/or treated as a pushover.  Jeff treats you with respect at all times!  He does not pressure and has the answers to all your questions or gets on his ""super phone"" and finds out what you need to know.  He follows up on his sales with a warm phone call.  He has always gone above and beyond to find what I am in need of at the time.  I cannot recommend him enough if you are shopping for a vehicle at Atzenhoffer!!!  I would not deal with anyone else and now count him as a dear friend!!!  How many car sales people can YOU say that about???  Thanks Jeff!!!!

2,"July 16, 2018","We have purchased 4 vehicles from Atzenhoffer with the help of Jeff Smith each time.  I cannot say a negative word about any of our experiences.  Jeff has been a big help with finding what we are looking for and has never been pushy.  Each visit I have seen nothing but honesty.  Troy has always been a big help also when it comes to the financing aspect of making a purchase.  Keep up the great customer service!!

3,"June 14, 2018","Sadly, this establishment has fallen down hard with their horrible customer service, vehicle salesmen, and prices. I’ve been a customer at Atzenhoffer for 25+ years and have purchased so many personal and commercial vehicles from them (Chevrolet’s and Cadillac’s). The service department has totally gone down with the unreliable service you receive, all while never receiving a loaner, even as a Cadillac driver. The salesman are absolutely unprofessional, as you can tell that people with no experience are hired, as when I went to look at a Cadillac last week, the young, not experienced “luxury car salesman” did not know how to use the shifter on an XT5. The prices are also terrible, as while it is important to support local business, it still is not worth it with such a horrible trade in value appraisals and the overall prices of the vehicles. I am not usually the one to write a bad review, but my family and I have been taken advantage of by Atzenhoffer so many times and I will not deal with it any longer. We always buy brand new cars from Atzenhoffer, but it is about time for things to change, as I now have started a great relationship with the people at MacHaik Ford Lincoln Victoria, and that’s who is going to be receiving our family’s business. We have already bought a very expensive vehicle from them and there are so many more to come. We now own our first Ford/Lincoln product and are thoroughly enjoying the change.",1.4
4,"May 29, 2018","This was my first buying experience with Atzenhoffer.  A friend recommended Troy York and Jeff Smith who were absolutely wonderful and  easy to work with.  Both were professional during and after the purchase. They were organized, listened to my wants and provided great service and answered all my questions within a timely manner.  I would definitely purchase another vehicle here and have started recommending them to friends. ",5.0

7,"May 24, 2018",We have purchased 2 vehicles from Jeff Smith in less than a year. Our experience with them both times has been so stress free!! They took care of everything for us! We have been very happy with their customer service every time we go there!! ,5.0
8,"May 24, 2018",Extremely courteous. I drove 2.5 hours to pick the truck. Jeff was very helpful as was his manager Troy York. Cassandra is finance was equally as competent and helpful. I was very comfortable and trusted Jeff’s feedback and bought the truck over the phone. When we arrived it took 45 minutes to finish the paperwork and we were on our way home. ,5.0
9,"January 10, 2018","We purchased a 2015 Chevrolet 2500HD and a 2014 Cadillac CTS.  Ken Willis was our sales representative.  Ken was very knowledgeable and answered all of our questions.  It was a very pleasant buying experience due to Ken.  Ken is very knowledgeable and professional.  Our family will buy our future car and truck purchases from Atzenhoffer Chevrolet and Ken will be our sales representative.  All of the Atzenhoffer staff that we had contact with was professional, courteous, and polite. Thanks Ken for all of your help, patience, and understanding.",5.0
10,"December 30, 2017", I purchased a vehicle from them online.  They told me the truck was rotten an accident and was in pristine shape.  So I buy the vehicle from them and found that it was an accident and there’s over $2500 in damages sales manager tells me he’s not gonna do anything to fix it and that’s my problem. Or I can send them the vehicle back at my cost when I’m 1500 miles away from them. I tried to work with him and get this resolved I asked him to just get me the parts and I would pay for the labor to get it  put on the truck. He told me he wasn’t gonna do anything and I need to honor my contract. But he can’t honor or Bacci vehicle they sell saying that it’s not been an accident. I then went from a really great experience to a nightmare sales manager there is a complete nightmare the only thing he is worried about is his bottom line sales numbers doesn’t care about the customer ,1.0
11,"July 08, 2016","Avoid this place at all cost!!!  Unprofessional and VERY unreliable.  If you have to have your Cadillac repaired, you would get it back faster by taking it to Houston.",1.2
12,"April 26, 2016","We recently purchased the new diesel Colorado from this dealership online. Listening and communication were the two major items that failed this dealership. We dealt through Scott McConnell who is the online sales representative. After a conversation regarding communication, he improved his service. We had issues with the type of truck we wanted and then no communication post order until we called to check on delivery. Once we cleared this communication issue, the truck was delivered as ordered. Scott reviewed the functions of the truck well. To close the deal, we had to wait for a Mr. Garcia to get to the dealership. This took 45 minutes. We know Scott knew we were coming, the time we would arrive so it seems Mr. Garcia wasn't informed or chose to ignore our appointment. Also, the title work did not list this as a farm truck which we made known. After we finished paying for the truck, Scott had another appointment which would have been fine except for our wait for closing the deal. There are many Chevrolet dealers in this area( we live in Gonzales) and we would recommend utilizing another dealership after our experience.",2.0
13,"January 19, 2016",Me and my fiancé were scammed by port lavaca dodge they sold us a truck then turned around a month later and tried to bump up our payments another hundred dollars a month and we refused to pay a dime more and they took the keys from me and stole the truck back. And left us with our credit was upside down because of what we went through to get in that truck so we were left feel hopeless and betrayed. But atzenhoffer said they heard about our situation and wanted to help. From the very beginning they wanted to feel we could trust them and they made it so easy to feel comfortable and we knew we were in good hands because they constantly explained everything and keeping us involved in every little detail. they worked so hard and never gave up on us even though our situation seemed impossible to get out of. Thwy found us the best deal I could ever imagine and got us in brand new vehicle! Thank you so much for everything atzenhoffer! I would choose to work with Rhett Kinkade atzenhoffer everytime! Every vehicle from now on our will definitely come from atzenhoffer! ,5.0
14,"October 16, 2015","I have had so many problems with my 2010 Traverse that I will NEVER NEVER NEVER buy another Chevy product and I will NEVER NEVER NEVER recommend Atzenhoffer Chevrolet to anyone who I would call a friend. Their service department is not what it was 10 years ago. I was APPALLED that TRENT would tell me that a 2010 Traverse with 54000 miles is an old vehicle and that the parts are just worn out. Really???????? I am 50 years old and have been driving Chevy's since I was 15 and NEVER NEVER NEVER had I driven such HORRIBLE vehicle like I have now. I can't wait to get something different and it certainly won't be a Chevy. This car has had nothing but problems with a noise in the front steering, I have had something in the steering changed, struts, mounting ??? changed and now 6 months later I had to have some type of bushings changed because they were worn out. Seriously, 6 months ago while it was under warranty and the vehicle was there for the same noise problem that it has been having since 2013, the bushings weren't worn out then. If a Chevy is considered old at 5 years with 54000 miles that does not say much for Chevy. My brother-inlaw has a Chevy truck with over 200,000 miles on it and it is in TERRIFIC shape and my husband has a 2002 Chevy Silverado with 70000+ miles and it is in TERRIFIC shape. His truck is NEVER in the shop. The last time his truck was in the shop was 5 years ago when we changed belts and hoses just due to the fact that they ""could have been bad due to age"". Now that's what I call a CHEVY and that's what I remember that brand standing for. Not the sorry excuse of a vehicle I have now. SO DISAPPOINTED IN CHEVY!!!!!! WHAT HAPPENED TO THE RELIABLE BRAND I TRUSTED FOR YEARS. Also, what about the employees of Atzenhoffer saying a Chevy is old and worn out at 5 years???? REALLY????? I DEFINITELY would not want an employee of mine to EVER TALK BAD ABOUT MY PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!! NOT A GOOD EMPLOYEE in my eyes. I know this is my opinion but I am entitled to it. Atzenhoffer needs to take a drive through their town and other surrounding towns and see how many ""new"" vehicles have Atzenhoffer on them and how many have other Victoria dealers plates. They would find very few Atzenhoffer plates and there is a reason why. If a Chevy product won't last for at least  5 years that is POOR QUALITY for GENERAL MOTORS!!!!!!!!!!!! SO DISAPPOINTED and SADDENED by the fact that CHEVY products have such POOR QUALITY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1.6
15,"August 31, 2014",When I needed to buy a car a couple of years ago I called Manny Villarreal at Atzenhoffer because the company I work for had purchased several vehicles from there and Manny had handled the sales.  From the minute I walked through the door Manny was professional but also friendly and most personable.  I never felt pressured to buy anything and always felt that he was working to truly get me the best deal possible.  The customer care I have received over the last two years is second to none.  I look forward to many years of doing business with Atzenhoffer.,4.8

20,"August 30, 2014","My wife and I had such a wonderful experience purchasing our used vehicle from Atzenhoffer,  I first located our 2010 Mazda5 on Autotrader.com and inquired and spoke with Jeff Smith, Internet Sales Manager.  He was very friendly, understanding, and just an all-around great person to correspond with from beginning to end.  Since we would be travelling from Tallahassee, FL to pick up the vehicle (more than 800 miles), Jeff made sure to answer all of my questions professionally, in a timely fashion, and addressed any potential concerns with honesty and sincerity.  We wanted to be assured of our purchase and not feel that our purchase would be risky.  The entire staff that we had the pleasure of meeting once we arrived were wonderful people as well.  You can tell that they all got along there.  This created a warm and inviting atmosphere...not always found at car dealerships. This also made me and my wife feel so much at ease after travelling all that way to make the purchase.  So a sincere thank you, Jeff Smith, Troy York, Tim Jurek, and Tommy Taylor for making our entire car-buying experience a great one.  We appreciate all of you going the extra mile in making us feel valued as customers...and not just wanting to make a quick buck!  We wish we had a dealership like yours in Tallahassee, FL.  We love our Mazda5 and I know our soon-to-be baby girl will love it as well...and she'll appreciate the story when we tell her that we traveled over 800 miles to get this family vehicle.  It was because the folks at Atzenhoffer made our car-buying experience such a memorable one.  Thank you again, Jeff, for taking care of us from beginning to end, and for not just being a salesman but being a friend throughout the entire process!  We now know why the Atzenhoffer dealership has been in business for so many years - being passed down from generation to generation.  The culture and value there create lifelong customers and memories.  Thank you for giving us a wonderful memory as we begin our family!      ",5.0

22,"August 28, 2014","We recently purchased our new Suburban, our 5th, as well as a Mazda CX5, from Atzenhoffer Cheverolet. They always treat us with respect and friendliness.  Manny Villareal is a wonderfully knowledgeable and personable sales representative.  He is straight forward and does not promise anything he cannot deliver. He has been a pleasure to work with both before and after the sale.  We would highly recommend both Atzenhoffer and Manny Villareal to anyone looking to purchase a vehicle.  Their excellent customer service extends well beyond the sale of the vehicle.",5.0
