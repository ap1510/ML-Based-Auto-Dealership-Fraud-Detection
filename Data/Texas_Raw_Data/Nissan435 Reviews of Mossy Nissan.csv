Brent DeMoss from finance was great as well. My only issue with him is that he didn't tell me the prices of the warranty packages. He just mentioned if I added the warranty package my notes be a certain amount. He didn't say he added almost $5,000.00 in packages. He didn't go over the finance paperwork after he finished it. I'm at fault for not reading everything before I signed it. It wasn't until the next day that I realized that I didn't even know how much I was financed for. That's when I seen that he added all the warranty packages over $4,900.00. It should be mandatory for them to explain the packages & prices, and see what the customer wants to add. It should be mandatory that the finance person goes over the paperwork for financing, so the customer knows exactly what they have and are paying for. Outside of that I had a wonderful experience.",4.0
1,"March 18, 2020","The recent purchase of our Nissan Armada was the best car buying experience I have ever had.  After visiting 2 other Nissan dealerships, I was ready to give up on getting an Armada.  My wife went online and found the vehicle she wanted on Mossy Nissan's website.  We contacted Mossy Nissan and Jonas Batista listened to what we said we wanted and how much we could pay.  He put together a deal to meet our needs. What's more is that he delivered the car to us!  My wife took a test drive, we went inside where Jonas reviewed the contract and paperwork before I signed.  We then went back out to the car where Jonas went over all the features and even programmed the garage door opener and set up my wife's phone.  We were so pleased that we didn't have to spend hours in the dealership negotiating a deal.  In addition to being professional and efficient, Jonas was a super nice guy.  I would highly recommend Jonas and Mossy Nissan.  As a matter of fact, I have already.",5.0
2,"March 07, 2020","Have used Mossy many times in past for routine maintenance and had no complaints. The last several times I noticed the level of service has really gone down. Either the service rep is not  available or busy with another customer or has gone home. Took my vehicle in yesterday for a Recall as well as some other repairs and left it there all day and guess what, today I checked over the bill and realized they didn’t even repair the recall. Called them and they confirmed it was not repaired. So frustrating... that was the number one reason I was scheduling the service - now I have to return next week. ",2.8

5,"February 25, 2020","I brought my vehicle into the dealership on 02/08/2020 at 7am in the morning because the check engine light was on and the maintenance light was flicking on and off as well. They had my vehicle for 3 entire day’s, I picked my vehicle up on Tuesday around 7am on 02/11/2020 before I had to be at work at 8am. I paid around $560 for all the repairs on my vehicle and then I got into my vehicle to find that my engine light was gone but my maintenance oil, filter, and tire light was still flicking on & off. I was already running late to work and my service advisor Boris was not there. I went ahead and sent my service advisor a text in regards to being dissatisfied that they had my vehicle for three days and all the issues were not fixed & he did not advise me on everything that needed to be done, so that I would have had a completed vehicle when I picked it up. He said that he would look into it that day. After that day he was totally unresponsive. I called multiple times, no call back. I even tried to contact the service supervisor Robert & left him a detailed message, which he failed to get back in contact with me to resolve the issue as well. I already lost 3 days of income being out of a vehicle, just to spend over $500 and still have an incomplete vehicle and unresponsive and unprofessional advisor and supervisor. For some reason, I’m not able to attached the screenshot and photos to this exact review.",1.0

10,"October 22, 2019","I can’t recommend Derrick M. dmuhammad@mossydirect.com enough for your next vehicle purchase. After a couple bad experiences with OTHER dealerships I was reluctant when I received a pre-approval offer from Capital One for a vehicle. My wife an I recently moved down to Houston from Washington D.C and accumulated some debt from our move. Although both our incomes are substantial, we didn’t have great credit. We also had two older vehicles and weren’t sure how we’d get financed when we’d eventually need replacements. Derrick was persistent and reached out to me a few times before I finally decided to give him and Mossy Nissan a try. Derrick’s communication during this entire process was exemplary. We talked via email, text and phone and he was always available whenever I had questions. He made it possible for me to complete my initial finance application over email which was incredibly helpful as I wasn’t keen on going into a dealership just to get denied financing. I was blown away by what Derrick was able to get my approved for. Still reluctant to believe everything was ‘a go’ I went in to seal the deal. This was literally the best experience I’ve ever had with a car dealership. I was off on the road in my new vehicle in record time. I can’t thank Derrick enough for being persistent and reaching out to me, because I never would have followed through with everything if it was someone other than him. 

On top of exceeding my expectations in every way possible Derrick was also to get my wife a vehicle as well. Just as flawless, her experience was nothing short of perfect. In the course of A WEEK, both my wife and I were set with new rides and we have Derrick M. from Mossy Nissan to thank. dmuhammad@mossydirect.com",5.0

23,"July 10, 2019","The prices were very high compared to other dealers. Plus on the finalized price, the finance team added $1000 extra which I notices only after going home late night.
Worst part was, after buying the car, I asked Jonas that car mats are missing in the new Nissan Rogue sports which he sold and he said let me check, which I am sure he never did and after sometime when I checked with him again, he said unfortunately sir, this car does not comes with car mats.
I was surprised to receive such a response, how can a brand new car not have mats?

Anyways, I do not recommend anyone to visit Mossy Nissan and especially do not deal with Jonas.",1.0

41,"May 09, 2019","I brought my first car from mossy in 2016 and a few years later I needed a new car due to a collision.

I told him what happened with my juke and he said I'm here for you! Meant so much to me to hear that and so I told him what I'd like in a new car and he went above and beyond and got me a great 2018.5 Nissan rogue sport at an amazing price I might add!  I will continue to come to Victor he is such an awesome, professional, caring person.  I even asked him to start the process online so when I got there it wouldn't take long and once I was at the dealership it was less than 1 hour and I had my new keys and car!

We looked at the new sport Lexus UX, the Infinity QX30 and the Nissan Rogue Sport SL.  We went to all three dealerships and ultimately chose the Nissan Rogue Sport SL for its value, looks, and exceptional driving comfort.  Our salesman, Taylor Mallek, made our car shopping experience extremely easy.  I absolutely despise shopping for cars and our experience with Mossy Nissan was fabulous!  Taylor never pressured us into choosing the Rogue Sport; he only wanted me to be happy with my purchase.  He was very friendly, professional and easy to work with.  His supervisor and the finance gentleman also deserve a shout out for their participation in closing the deal.  We loved our previous Nissan cars, never had any issues with them and highly recommend Mossy Nissan and their staff if you are looking to purchase a new vehicle. ",5.0

51,"April 25, 2019","Taylor worked extremely hard to get me approved for the vehicle I purchased. I came with an auto loan already on my credit, yet Taylor was still able to get me approve for an additional loan. I was persistent on not having a co-signer and he and the finance team were still able to get the deal done. 

This process lasted about four days, but I never felt like I did not know what was going on. Taylor and the sales manager constantly communicated with me through email and text message.

79,"January 18, 2019","I might not have received superb service from Houston, nonetheless I am still going.to represent my Service Advisor from 2700 National City Blvd * National City, CA 91950 because he gave me A+++++ service.

My vehicle was towed in thru Roadside Assistance due to tire issues as well as undercarriage protector being loose. The tow truck driver (not thru mossy) decided it would be a good idea to rip the protector out. Mind you, the tow company was over an hour late. I was late for my appointment at Mossy and near tears...

My service advisor Carlos, seeing how upset I was turned my morning from a bad one to a great one. He immediately grabbed a cardboard paper and knelt down to check underneath my car. He assured me that if Mossy could fix it, they would. Throughout the whole time my car was in service, he was attentive, answered all my questions and repeatedly checked up on me to explain the whole process as my vehicle was going throuout the different stages of trouble shooting. He was able to resolve my issues with my vehicle and never once tried to gauge me. In fact, he was so patient with me, he took his time to explain different promotions to me that Mossy offered to get me more bank for my buck in the future for when I bring my vehicle back. As a female who is unsavy when it comes to a vehicle, it is hard to come across someone you can trust that won't take advantage of your lack of knowledge. From now on, I will only bring my car into Carlos.

Btw...to kill boredom whole my car was being serviced, I went on Yelp to see Mossy Nissan (National City ) reviews, and why was I not surprised to see the last review was made by somebody that Carlos helped. In a few months...my daughter will be going to college, and I will be buying her a vehicle from here. A happy customer is indeed a returning customer. Thank you MOSSY!!!

He is very easy to talk to and truly seemed invested in our own needs vs what he may need to sell. When it was time to look at the car we took a look and got in for a test drive. It was not uncomfortable at all, he talked about some of the features and was very knowledgeable about any questions I had while driving. I didn’t feel rushed and was able to act like the car was my own for a little while. When we got back to the lot we looked over the engine and checked out additional features. I mentioned another car, a Ford I had seen on the dealership site and though he didn’t know about it right off the bat he was able to pull it up and showed us the carfax and pulled it around for us to take a look at. He never rushed us and we really got to take a good look and gave it another test drive. Once we made our decision Ismail was great at working with us to get to where we wanted to be for financing.

216,"February 18, 2018","I was in the market for a new-to-me Nissan Rogue and was willing to drive to get just the vehicle I wanted.  So one Thursday I took a trip to Houston to check out some options.  After a disappointing and off-putting experience at one dealership, where I was blatantly lied to and treated as if I was an idiot, I was tempted to go home.  But my friend convinced me that since I was already in town, I might as well go over to Mossy as well to see the Rogue of interest there as it had every feature I wanted and was well priced.

Talk about your night and day experience!  Floyd as an absolute pleasure to chat with!  He never once tried to mislead me about the Rogue I was looking at or tried to convince me that it was far inferior to a newer version.  I never felt like he was looking down on me for being a woman shopping alone and he recognized and respected my actual primarily interests in the vehicle, versus trying to emphasize that it was ""pretty"" (not that it wasn't, but for me, I picked the Rogue for the safety features and other amenities for the price point).

Even with the haggling process, we both were laughing as we went back and forth and it was such a pleasure.  Whenever he had to leave me, he always let me know why and came back promptly - no power play games or the like.  I felt like we both came out of it happy. As someone who only buys a car every other decade or so, that first dealership made me dread it, but Floyd turned it around.  So glad I went to Mossy.  Not only would recommend them, but already have!  Worth the drive if you aren't in Houston.

And while it isn't as big a deal, I must say, they had a really nice restroom and waiting area for their service department!  If I lived in Houston, I'd be rather inclined to go there for service just to enjoy the wait. ;-)

The only minor negative bit I had was the finance person, Chris', somewhat snide remark about me switching to a ""real bank"" because I had to have my bank mail them the payment.  My account was a victim of Equifax's foolery and my bank is a major national bank - not their fault I'd forgotten to reorder personal checks after they had to give me a new account late last year to protect my finances and personal info - I write one at most once a year!  Still, I appreciate that he didn't try to hard sell me on adding thousands to the price by expanding the Nissan Certified Warranty or anything like that.  He explained the options, let me think them over, and when I declined, we moved on.  Other than the banking remark, he was pleasant enough to deal with and I didn't leave with any hard feelings.",5.0

My car was not starting properly and I could not figure out what was wrong with it. I took a video with sound and my daughter took me to the dealer to find someone that could help me, as it didnt look like it was the battery and it was making a strange sound.
At first an employee from the service department (or it could have been other dept. but he was by the service door with a red polo shirt) refused to help me as the store was about to close and the rest of the team was already gone. However, three wonderful employees went above and beyond to help me and my daughter figure out what was wrong with the car and provided the proper information for me to contact a tow truck that would drop off my car in the dealer for review. 
I would like to highlight and thank Willie Saunders, Rafael Molina and Leo (Master Technician) for going the extra mile and provide EXCELLENT customer service it times of need.

Thank you,

229,"August 02, 2017","We are furious at our service with this place! We took our car there because it's under a Gold warranty that cost us a lot of extra money when we bought the car. We got our car back after the SECOND time we took it to Mossy to try to have three different issues fixed..again. Each time they called us that our car was repaired and ready, but they literally did not fix one of the three problems and on EACH occasion, when we picked up the car, we brought to their attention that the problems were not resolved. They then invited us to bring it back another day ""at our convenience.""I got so mad the last time I picked up my car that I wrote a bad service evaluation and got a quick call back from service manager, Brian Loveless. He assured me that if I had only spoken to him on site when I picked up the unrepaired car that he would have resolved my problem immediately (My fault for not knowing to find him). When it came down to him actually fixing the problems that I had paid copays and out of pocket for to fix, they repeatedly found some B.S. excuse for why the lack of repairs was actually somehow MY FAULT. They're some shady characters. I paid $300 for them to clean some drainage lines and they ""guaranteed"" me that the service would fix my problem..not under warranty of course. When I realized the next day that it didn't fix the problem, they didn't even look at the car again and suggested it must be a different problem all together and offered me a quote to repair something completely different...without even looking at the car again! How's that for a guarantee? Today some Luis Cedilla guy called me back because Brian Loveless was ""too busy"" to return my calls or emails over the last weeks. Luis kept talking circles around my complaints, without actually addressing my issues or justifying why I paid good money for no repairs and to waste time without having a vehicle. This place is a money trap, pure and simple. They guarantee their services and repairs, unless they can keep dishing out excuses long enough that you'll stop contacting them.",1.0

234,"May 08, 2017",When both my son and daughter had such a positive experience with Melvin Watson at Mossy I knew who I wanted to do business with. Melvin's customer service is like no other. I have purchased many cars over the years and this was the most positive and easiest process I've ever experienced. Melvin actually listened to what I wanted instead of trying to sell me something I didn't. If you are looking for a car contact Melvin. You will not be disappointed.,5.0

I just said one that i could afford and the first vehicle he pulled up was a Chevrolet Malibu. The exact vehicle my son was wanting. But without the sunroof.  Needless to say purchased it on the spot.

239,"April 17, 2017","We became new customers of Mossy Nissan when we purchased a CPO 2013 Nissan Juke SL last week. We have very high standards for our expectations of a dealership. As a result of the tremendous efforts of Ray Moghaddam in sales and Brent DeMoss in finance, we were delighted with not only our purchase decision but also, and more important, the team effort displayed to make our deal happen. The Juke was delivered in ideal condition, the pricing of the vehicle and the extended warranty were extremely competitive and, most important, both Ray and Brent considered our specific needs and then customized a solution to meet them. With this excellent start to our Mossy Nissan experience, we are eager and excited to meet the service team!

I have always bought new and this time I looked at used, but the deal on the new was better than some of my Used options.  I appreciate JD and his team for helping me pick out used vehicles, but I couldn't seem to walk away from the new 2017 Titan.  It is a great-looking truck with everything that I need.  In working with Harold Bailey, I was able to get the best deal, for my budget and trust that I am well taken care of.  Mossy treats everyone like Family and they never forget who you are.

246,"March 18, 2017","I have been searching for a used car for about 2 months, and everytime I went to a dealership, I felt that the salesmen were not honest and just trying to make me buy a car by any means, this was not the case when I went to Mossy Nissan dealership. I met M.D. (Michel Delasse), and he was one of the most genuine and honest salesmen and just person in general I meant, he actually wanted to help me out instead of me helping him get a commission just like all other general salesmen. Also my car had a small issue the day after that could easily be fixed and Rafael Molina gladly said to come in and get it fixed at no cost, he was really great and told me that he will give me a ride to work and back and accommodate me as needed which I really appreciated. It was a really great experience and made me feel like I am buying a car from family. I most definitely recommend Mossy Nissan as an honest place to buy a car and more importantly recommend the best salesman I have dealt with.

247,"March 17, 2017","I was already working with another dealer when Costco directed me to Mossy.  Hend Elsherif (BDC rep) contacted me immediately, answered my questions and told me she'd have a Costco-certified sales rep for me when I arrived.  I didn't know, at the time, how lucky I was to get Melvin Watson!  He was very knowledgeable, responsive to my questions (and, I had a lot), willing to move/talk at my pace (fast), always available (by text/email/phone), respectful and polite.  All of that is important, but the extra touch is that he's fun, funny and became a friend in the ~7 hours I spent with him.  We weren't far into the conversation before I trusted that he had MY best interest at heart.  I had definite ideas about what I wanted/needed and Melvin, Hend, Harold Bailey (Sales Manager) and Brent DeMoss (Finance Manager) all respected that, but told me when they thought I might be missing something - just what I needed!

If I had known exactly what kind of car/options I wanted, I probably could have been in and out in half the time, but I wouldn't have gotten to hang out and experience these great Mossy employees or to really understand the Mossy culture.  They're all about the customer!  After pickup, I drove my new car home alone at night and Melvin even had me text him to let him know I got home safely - like a car advisor, father, brother and friend all in one!  I'll be back like many of Melvin's repeat customers!",5.0
248,"March 07, 2017","I had not purchased a vehicle in about 15 years so I was a bit apprehensive about returning to the car buying experience. I saw that Mossy had a 4X4 Xterra (actually 2) on the lots so I set up an appointment which was very easy. I found Rudy Reyes to be extremely easy to deal with during the purchase process. He was knowledgeable about the vehicle so he could address my questions. I liked that he did not try to ""hard sell"" me but let me take my time to decide. I would deal with him again on my next purchase (although given my history it might be a while!)

Also, the Financing Manager, Sidney Thomson, was super nice and a pleasure to deal with. Like Rudy, he did not try to force me into anything I was not comfortable with.

I would recommend Mossy to my family and friends when they are ready to purchase a vehicle.

FROM MY VERY FIRST ENCOUNTER WITH MOSSY NISSAN IN LATE 2010 WHEN I PURCHASED MY NISSAN MAXIMA IN DECEMBER 2010, MARK PANYARD HAS PROVIDED ME EXCEPTIONAL AND SPECIAL ASSISTANCE.  IN ADDITION TO BE VERY COURTEOUS AND POLITE, HE THEN AND CONTINUES NOW TO GO FAR BEYOND THE CALL OF DUTY IN ENSURING THAT I RECEIVED TREMENDOUS SERVICE AND ASSISTANCE AT MOSSY NISSAN.  DURING THE PURCHASE OF MY AUTOMOBILE, HE WAS EXTREMELY HELPFUL AND CARING ENSURING THAT I HAD FULL AND COMPLETE KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION REGARDING THE PURCHASE OF THE NISSAN AUTOMOBILE.  IN ADDITION, SINCE THE PURCHASE, HE ALWAYS GREETS ME BY NAME WHEN I AM AT THE DEALERSHIP FOR ROUTINE SERVICE AND OTHER MATTERS.  HIS ATTENTIVENESS TO ME IS VERY GENUINE AND SINCERE AND IT MAKES ME FEEL THAT I AM A SPECIAL AND VALUED CUSTOMER AT MOSSY NISSAN.  I PERSONALLY THANK MARK PANYARD FOR HIS ASSISTANCE, COURTESY AND RESPECT THAT HE REPEATEDLY EXTENDS TO ME AT MOSSY NISSAN.  FOR THESE REASONS, I VERY PLEASED WITH MY DEALINGS WITH MOSSY NISSAN AND PLAN TO HAVE A LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIP WITH MOSSY NISSAN FOR MY AUTOMOBILE NEEDS.

MARK, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

301,"December 04, 2016","Yesterday we bought our 17 year old granddaughter a Nissan Rogue for her birthday-Christmas present.  After explaining to our salesman, Simon Talebi, that the car was to be a surprise he did everything possible to make it fun for her and us.  There were details requiring special treatment because the car was being registered in her name and she wasn't with us.  There was paperwork that needed her signature and we didn't have her DL or insurance papers with us.  But Simon handled these details and made everything happen.  

We came back today with Jen.  She thought we on our way to get our Christmas tree until we drove into Mossy.  Simon was waiting outside for us with two other employees to wish her Happy Birthday.  As for the remaining paperwork, Chris Gee, an assistant director, carefully explained everything a first-time car buyer needed to know.

Buying her Rogue was quick and easy.  Simon is a jewel and the Mossy Nissan staff is helpful and professional.   We fully expect Jen's future service will be as good.

This is my sixth car purchased from Mossy Nissan Houston...now you understand why I gave them FIVE STARS. From my first purchase from Harold Bailey a very long time ago who sold me most of my cars, the service from Mossy Nissan is Second to None. This recent sale on 10/31/2016 was handled by Floyd Chambers and he was as good as it gets. I was even more impressed with the service after the sale.  He called me 2 or 3 times to make sure everything was going ok and asked if I had any questions. THAT WAS IMPRESSIVE!! Floyd even sent me a Happy Thanksgiving text on Thanksgiving Day. Wow!

Brent, (the Finance guy) remembered me from the last time I bought a car from there. That was pretty cool that he remembered me. He was very talkative and friendly and that made this process easier.

Talal Attar is likely the most non ""car salesman"" salesperson I have met. He was patient, objective and, surprisingly, common sense driven. He thankfully did NOT do what I have sadly come to dread from all car salesperson - talk as if the customer is financially illiterate by making the most absurd suggestions.

At one point, when matters got a little hairy, the Manager, Mark Paynard, stepped-in and made things right. That speaks volumes about the dealership's management.

368,"September 30, 2016",I've been a loyal Mossy Nissan customer for over 9 years. I have always left the dealership feeling as if I just won something. I've purchased 3 of my own vehicles.. took my husband to Mossy and my Brother in law knowing they too would find what they wanted at the price they wanted. ,5.0

Melvin quarterbacked me through all the departments in a very good manner, and I felt that I was an important customer. I was not set on buying a vehicle when I came in, but the level of service and atmosphere in the store removed any concerns, and I was very pleased that we managed to go through the entire process in a few hours!

371,"September 29, 2016",I have never been able to get in and out of a dealership with what I wanted and how I wanted without alot of red tape. Today was different. Melvin ask what I needed then gave me my options and introduced me to Harold who showed great patience and understanding. He explained in detail all of my concerns.. I never felt like just another number. Melvin and Harold are two of the best people not just in sales. They have earned my trust along with my business. I told them the car was for my daughter and they made me feel like family. They are great with time management so go see them you won't be disappointed.,5.0

373,"September 26, 2016",I went in to Mossy looking to trade in my old Pathfinder for the new Altima. This would be my 2nd purchase from Mossy and 4th Nissan. I’ve always referred Mossy over the other dealers in Houston so I knew where I would get my next vehicle from. Willie Saunders and Charlie helped me get into my new ride. Both gentlemen were very helpful and friendly. While Willie went out of his way to found the car with my requirements. Charlie was very friendly and had me laughing through the ordeal of purchasing a new vehicle. Both gentlemen worked very hard and even helped me remove all my many belongings out of the old truck in to the new car. I am very happy with the service these guys did and I really love my new Altima. Thank you so much guys keep up the good work!!!,4.8

379,"September 23, 2016","I have purchased my vehicles through Nissan since i was 19 yrs old , in San Antonio,Tx. I am now 33. I recently moved to Houston and was having my Frontier serviced at Mossy Nissan.  I ran into an old friend from hugh school, at the dealership, who happened to be a salesman for Mossy Nissan, Willie Saunders. He immediately asked if I was being taken care of promptly and Welcomed me to Houston. This was my first time coming into the dealership since my move. He gave me his card and told me to call if I needed anything! Turns out a few months later i did! I was looking to trade in my Frontier and called to see if there were any deals going on for trade-in's. I called him on a Wednesday afternoon and by Friday morning i was in my new 2016 Nissan Altima!! Thanks Willie! I love it! ",5.0
380,"September 23, 2016","I had a great experience with Mossy Nissan. My review is based on the people I came across during the whole process of my purchase. Been there a few times but I have to say the front desk ladies are outstanding. Unfortunately I did not get their names. They had a very good attitude, professional and very helpful. 
Now, Beau, the sales person,was unbelievably outstanding. His professionalism and mannerism in general made me feel I was dealing with the right person for my purchase. Beau was so helpful - answered every question I had, be it technical or just general. He was also very patient throughout the process - did not make me feel like I was bothering him or something like that - because some people will make you feel like they are bothered one way or another. Also he did not push the sale on me - gave me total latitude to ponder on all info and choices I had on my plate. 
When it came to finally negotiating on the price, Harold Bailey helped a lot. Again Harold did all he could to explain pricing issues and took it upon himself to make sure we arrive at a price that was satisfactory to me and whatever documents were required were available. Just the right people to deal with. It can't get better than that. after the purchase, I sat with Chris Gee, who went over the warranty plans and was good. I just have to say, if I have to refer someone else I will refer them to Beau and Harold because they will just make your day! These guys are great! I give them a 100% thumbs up.",5.0
381,"September 23, 2016","Mossy Nissan has the greatest customer service that I have ever seen or experienced at any auto dealership! I am no spring chicken. I had been going around and around in circles dealing with Tom Peacock Nissan for an entire week. I made five separate trips to go to their location, which is over an hour away from my house, by the way. Only because they offered an astronomical deal that they knew they had no intention of EVER fulfilling.! They did not care about what I had going on in my life nor my frustration level bc they were already at work and they had nowhere else to be. I am actually surprised that no one has dropped a bomb over there. Stop playing with people. God gave me the inspiration to go to Mossy Nissan which is only 10 minutes from my home. Mossy Nissan took care of me in a few hours and I was in and out with my brand new 2016 Nissan Rogue Cayenne Red!! Whooop! Thank you to David Lim, Sidney Thomson, and Mark Panyard. They took great care of me from the front to the back! Love you guys, see you soon. 💋",5.0

384,"September 21, 2016","My name is Tasha Brown, I was is the market for a new SUV vehicle. I would like to thank Mr. Mark Kirchner for taking time out to speak with me about purchasing a vehicle. I knock on Mr. Kirchner office door and ask if I could share some concerns with him, he was very polite and genuine with the conversation. I have never met a General Manger at a dealership who had a great personality and was very polite. Thank you Mr. Kirchner for everything you did with my purchase. Even though Mr. Kirchner is the boss he never treated me as If I was nothing and that says a lot for his morality!!!  Let me start by saying there is no other Nissan dealership that has great customer service, great prices, and make you feel like family when you walk through the door. This is my third vehicle from Mossy Nissan. I started to purchase a SUV from AutoNation Nissan in Katy but the Sales manger did not want to cooperate with me. They were very  aggressive about me purchasing a vehicle. I explain what I wanted to pay and purchase but in reality they were trying to tell me how to spend my money. AutoNation doesn't have a variety of Nissan Murano like Mossy. I was never pressure once at Mossy when purchasing my vehicle. Mr. Watson, and Mr. Bailey explain everything to me very professional and way my option for me. I was even told to think about it unlike AutoNation who just wanted me to sign my name. If any one is looking for a Nissan dealership who cares about their customer please see Melvin Watson, and Harold  Bailey at Mossy Nissan. You will not regret your experience there. I would like to thank the team from doing an amazing job with my Nissan Murano purchase!!!!!!  You guys Rock!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",5.0

I've never had a better experience at a car dealership. Michel was a complete gentleman, and a trustworthy person, I didn't feel pressured or hassled into buying a car that I wasn't sure of. Once I found the car I wanted, a Nissan Rogue; we started to look into the numbers. I thought being a first time car buyer, with a tight budget would be difficult but with Michel, and Harold everything came out much better than even my highest expectations. They both worked with what I gave them and came back with a fantastic deal, they truly want to make sure you're happy and satisfied with your car. Lastly, Alfonso Gutierrez in the financial department made it a great end to the experience, he was very respectful and made sure he went over everything I needed to know.

393,"September 17, 2016","When I decided to trade my 2015 Chevy Tahoe in on a murano I visited several Nissan dealerships. It seemed at all the other locations I visited besides mossy all the sales reps I dealt with did not want to work out a deal as I was trading in a car that they didn't value as all websites did. I came to all the dealerships prepared with the nada and kbb print out of my trade and I also had a handful of vehicles at each locations picked out with the Internet ""specials"" each locations was running for that week.  All other locations did not take the time to look at all my little extra work I did to try and make the process faster.  Please note Mossy Nissan is approximately 1.25 hour drive from my house. I decided to try out this last Nissan dealership after work on Friday where I got to meet Joseph Alawad.  I original was sold on a certified pre owned murano I seen on the Internet however by the end of my experience I ended up with a new 2016 SL.  I was very happy with my hole experience. I was surprised that the pre owned manager (Mike) did not try and push his used vehicle on to me. When I ran my numbers and showed both Mike and Joseph that I could purchase a brand new for nearly the same price they both informed me that they would gladly set me up with the right guy (mark K). Joseph and I walked over to the new cars side where I was able to meet Mark. Joseph explained my situation to mark where in turn mark asked myself what I would be interested in. I had already done my homework so I gave him two stock numbers I seen on their website. We were able to look at both cars however I could not make the final decision as this was going to be my wife's. I informed both Joseph and Mark that I would not be able to make this happen today and that I will come back with my wife in the following days.  I ended up going back the next day with my wife however I never once received a call, text or email from Joseph begging for my business as this happens at all other dealerships I had went to prior toMossy. When we arrived Joseph had both cars side by side so that my wife could pick. I had not signed any documents that previous day on the deal we had made nor was anything written down so I was a little nervous coming back.  Mark and Joseph must have gotten together when I left and put everything on paper because when I came back the verbal deal Mark had made with me previously was still the same.  I highly highly recommend both Joseph Alawad and Mark Panyard if you are looking for a Nissan. ",5.0

Willie Saunders (sales rep) was wonderful to work with, and he's an all-around great guy. I came in wanting the new Murano, and then realized I was stuck between the fully loaded Rogue and the Murano S. Willie was able to determine which car would fit me best based on our conversation. I am happy to say that we decided on the Murano and we are LOVING it. I know it wasn't a money driven recommendation on Willie's part because he actually would have made more $ if he had convinced me to buy the Rouge. But Willie is an honest, straight-forward guy who is more concerned with making his customers happy than earning a few extra bucks...and he knew I wouldn't be happy with the Rogue. The entire car-buying experience was awesome and stress-free! We look forward to being Mossy customers for a long time to come. In fact, we will be back to purchase a new car for my husband in about 6 months! SHOP AT MOSSY AND ASK FOR WILLIE! (also a special thanks to Harold Bailey (sales manager) for his assistance. He is also a great man!)

PS- When I went back 2 days later to get my car, Willie pointed out Mr. Mossy leaving in his new Murano (man, I knew I got the right car if Mr. Mossy is driving one himself) and as I was driving home, I started to regret not running up to him and letting him know firsthand of the wonderful car-buying experience we had!

Mossy Nissan is horrible - worst purchase experience ever! Took my son's car in on Tuesday July 5, 2016 to have the windows tinted and brought an issue to their attention that my son wanted addressed. There were spots on the radio screen that wouldn't come off, this Altima was 10 days old. I spoke to the Service Manager Joseph Gonzalez which told Ivan Clovis to look at the radio and to take care of it. Ivan told me that the radio would need to be replaced as the issue was behind the screen itself. Ivan fed me some bs as well as gave me the runaround. Joseph told Ivan to order a new radio and to schedule the installation for Saturday July 16, 2016. I asked for documentation in writing that showed the radio was being ordered. I sent an email to Joseph & Ivan on Monday July 11, 2016 to confirm that the radio would be available for installation for Saturday July 16, 2016 as scheduled. Neither, Joseph or Ivan responded to my email. Ivan called me within 5 minutes of receiving my email to tell me that it would be 2-3 weeks before the radio would be in. I asked why I was lied to & why he had made me an apt for July 16, 2016 knowing it would be 2-3 weeks. Ivan had nothing to say - I ended up hanging up on him. I sent an email to the General Manager David Hruska (same person that responds to these reviews) and to this day he hasn't responded either. Mike Hruska did call after I filed a Complaint with the VP of Consumer Relations of Nissan North America. Mike Hruska is the Service Director of Mossy Nissan - Mike made excuses for the whole Service Department and told me that the radio had NEVER even been ordered as Ivan was instructed to do. Wow - TOTAL Surprise! Mike also told me that the radio would be replaced with a refurbished radio rather than a brand new one! This car is brand new! You're NOT putting a refurbished radio in this car when it came from the Factory Brand New and is a Nissan issue! Mossy Nissan is putting the blame on Panasonic when in fact it's Mossy Nissan that is screwing us over! It's always easier to pass the buck rather than own up to the BS that they're pulling! 

Mossy Nissan of Houston is a nightmare! Mossy Nissan runs a complete circus and lies to their customer's. Mossy Nissan doesn't pride itself in Customer Service and could care less if the Customer is Happy or Not! Mossy Nissan is a huge SCAM!! Buyer Beware!!! Do your research - don't buy a Nissan but if you must, definitely find another Nissan Dealership to purchase from. Don't give these clowns your $ - you'll regret it!!! This has been the worst purchase ever and we regret ever giving these idiots our business! 

We have filed a Complaint with the BBB as well as a Consumer Complaint with the Attorney General. 

We will NOT STOP until Mossy Nissan of Houston takes responsibility for their issue and replaces this defective radio with a brand new radio - and we don't care if this radio has to be taken out of another brand new car! You're NOT getting away with putting a refurbished radio in my brand new car that's now less than a month old. Seems that Mossy Nissan would rather deal with the bad reviews, complaints, etc., rather than just doing the right thing! 

Mossy Nissan definitely doesn't know what ""Deceptive Trade Practice"" means!

417,"January 30, 2015","My Nissan Murano needed some work done under an extended warranty that Nissan issued for a problematic transmission. After being jerked around by David McDavid Nissan I decided that I would call Mossy, since that is where I bought my car. 

I had been on the phone with Nissan Corporate for some time that day. Eventually they called Mossy to assist with getting my car towed and getting the work started. The receptionist said she would get the manager to call me back, which he did not do. When I called them a few hours later they seemed very receptive to helping and asked when I would like to bring the car in. Since I did not feel I should drive it in the state it was in, I asked that a tow be arranged (Corporate stated a tow was included in the extended warranty).  Michael Hruska was very adamant that a tow would not be included. 

At that point I decided to call corporate back to verify and said I would call Michael back once I sorted it out with corporate. When I couldn’t get a hold of corporate I left Michael a message; my intention was to let him know that I had not been able to get ahold of corporate and would have to get it all sorted out the next day since it was already late. When he called me back his demeanor had completely changed. I started explaining that I had not been able to reach corporate and that it clearly stated online (Q13 - google Nissan Assist CVT FAQ's) that a tow was, in fact, included as part of the extended warranty. He quickly interrupted me and would not let me speak at all for the duration of the call. Out of a 4 minute phone call I spoke for maybe 45 seconds. I wish I had recorded it so that the world could see what an absolute jerk this guy was to me.

This is a paraphrase of what he told me: 

Ma’am; we certainly thank you for your business in buying your car from Mossy. I can tell that you are already upset with Nissan before having reached Mossy. As it is not Mossy’s fault that you are already upset I simply cannot risk a poor customer review, getting a bad CSI (not sure what that means exactly) OR ultimately risking MY pay, to service your vehicle. We decline to help you. 

And then he HUNG UP ON ME!!!

So instead of taking the opportunity to turn my day, and my opinion of Nissan, around and be the HERO that took care of my car HE HUNG UP IN MY FACE!  I was flabbergasted.

Today, 1/30, I called Central Houston Nissan, and spoke with a gentleman named Augustine. He explained that the tow would be covered in the event the repairs are covered by the warranty. That they would foot the bill until the time in which it could be determined whether the issue was covered under that extended warranty. My car was picked up within an hour! 

Much KUDOS to Central Houston Nissan service department, who will get a GLOWING review from me; one that could have just as easily been received by Mossy. Augustine, with Central Houston Nissan, talked to me this morning after having already been frustrated with, not one, but TWO dealers and he STILL helped me.  Although my car has not been fixed yet and I have no idea what will happen with it, I am confident that I will receive the service anyone deserves. 

I will not be returning any business to Mossy and will spread the word to help my family and friends avoid such HORRIBLE service as well!!! 

After reading some of the reviews and feedback here it is apparent this is a family business so I am not sure that I will get a response on this since my main complaint is with one of the Hruska gentlemen. 

My advice to anyone thinking of going to Mossy… DON’T! If you do, proceed with caution.

418,"October 21, 2014",Worst car dealership experience ever! Shady pre finance guy was totally unacceptable and I directly asked salesperson questions regarding how things were being handled while completing paperwork and was misinformed each time. Two salesman trying to sell the same car when we were the first customers there to view and test drive the car after the salesman called and invited us out to specifically view this vehicle....total waste of time and effort!  Not sure how they are in business.,1.0
419,"July 19, 2014","I went in to have my car serviced and I also added to have a detail car wash. I didn't particularly like the cost of $129 since I had to have a key reset from a previous dealers mistake and I had to pay for that as well. But I went and had it done anyways and mentioned to make sure not to throw away the domino that was in my car. Yea it may seem lame, but it is my good luck charm. My grandfather passed away recently and he played dominoes. At his funeral, we each got one domino. Anywho, I went and picked up my car and the domino was gone. I asked my sales representative (Alex Rodriguez) and he immediately took action. He let his supervisor know ( I believe his name was Joe) and they worked really hard. They both looked and eventually found the domino. I am extremely great-full of what they did I did not care that my new key did not work (which they fixed right away). I recommend this dealership to anyone. Great customer service and also great service department.  If you need anything, Alex will take care of you. ",4.4
420,"March 24, 2014","Stay away from the service department here.  We took our 370Z there because we were having clutch problems and they quoted us $3,000 to repair.  We called around and many mechanics were saying it should not cost that much and don't let them start such a pricey repair job on that car.  When we went to pick it up, there was a HUGE scratch on the driver side door.  They denied having anything to do with it and said ""With a car that has 90,000 miles and has been handled by a tow truck driver, we are not taking repsonsibility.""  WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH IT?  Seriously, unless you plan to inspect your car the entire time it is in their hands, I wouldnt trust them.  I wont be taking my car there ever again and I dont plan on purchasing a new 370 with them either.",1.4
421,"February 05, 2014","I bought 3 new cars from Kirk Verrett at Mossy, and all 3 sales went above and beyond expectation, but I also want to give recognition to the service dept, as I believe the service after the sale is as important as the sale itself, and mossy nissan service exceeds all expectations!
When I drive in the service area, Joe Gonzalez usually meets me immediately on he driveway and greets me by make in a friendly way ""Hi Jim good to see you, how is everything…etc etc"". Then when I go inside Benny the service manager then greets me by name, then Bob and Reggie greet me….in all its like being with ""friends ""and a very enjoyable experience!!!! all with doing excellent work
all in all, if you want to experience a GREAT SERVICE experience< i would highly recommend visiting the team at Mossy Nissan!

422,"December 26, 2013",Everyone in the service department will make things up that you need to do to your car to reach their sales goals. The manager is rude and does not know how to explain anything his employees do or say. Always get a second opinion and stay away from the service department! ,1.0
423,"October 14, 2013","My 2011 Juke was having air conditioning problems and Joe Gonzalez really took the bull by the horns and kept the service technicians working on it until they got it fixed.  I would definitely recommend Joe / Mossy to anyone having a problem with their Nissan vehicle.  Fortunately, all of my service was under warranty so cost was not a factor this time around.  I really appreciate the excellent service I received at Mossy and most especially how I was treated by Joe.  Big thank you!",5.0
424,"August 08, 2013",Poor dealership. The sales personal is rude and arrogant. There is a severe disconnect between their online staff offers and online advertisement and what you get if you really walk in. I would say safe time and stay away. The really fulfill the common stereotype of a car dealer. ,1.0
425,"January 01, 2013",The team at Mossy were professional and ultimately they were willing to work with me on the pricing. I do suggest that you bring in other offers. ,5.0
426,"April 15, 2012","I've recently bought a used 2002 Nissan Altima 2.5S from a third party dealer. Before I bought the car I took it to Mossy Nissan to have a Certified PreOwned Inspection check. After waiting 3 hours and a total cost of $253 they came up with a list telling the faulty parts of the vehicle like window, washers, trunk etc. So I trust the Nissan Certified mark and since there were no major problems and I bought the car. After a while I recognized an extensive oil consumption (5 qt at 100 miles). When I investigate the car myself I see the blue smoke coming from exhaust which is a sign of oil burning. So I don't understand how this dealer couldn't find out this (easy to find but expensive to fix) problem. Even me like no mechanical knowledge man can see this problem but the mechanics at the so-called Certified Nissan Dealer couldn't see. As a result I dont want to lose my time for trying the fix the car instead I'm trying to sell it at a more cheaper price. I'm also dealing with the third party dealer which I bought the car. But that was Mossy Nissan which I've trusted in this purchase and very dissapointed me. I'll never go to a Nissan Dealer either for mechanics or for purchasing a car because of this situation. May be I'll never buy another Nissan. Because I don't think that Nissan will honor its name and this Certified mark on the inspection that the dealer made.",1.2
427,"May 17, 2011","I will never take my car back to this place!!! I was very pleased with everything at first but once my car sat at the dealership for 2 days I was a little upset. I have a 10 month old and NO CAR. Bennie (service manager) told me that he was trying to get ahold of my warranty department and said that he could never get anyone on the phone! FUNNY because I called and got someone right on the line!!! Then tells me that not everything was covered so he couldn’t fix some of the work that was needed. Also really funny because I have a platinum warranty so I call the warranty company and they tell me that it was the dealership (Mossy Nissan aka Bennie) that told them that this was not a warrantable item, not my warranty company like Bennie had said! 
So thank you Mossy Nissan for wasting my time.

428,"May 16, 2011",I recently got my vehicle serviced at Mossy Nissan and everyone I met there was super friendly!  They got my vehicle in and out in a timely manner and were great to work with.  It's nice to go to a dealership where everyone truly seems to want to help and enjoys their job- it's definitely not what you would expect from a typical car dealer.  My experience in the service dept was such a breeze that when I'm ready to buy my next car it will be from Mossy Nissan.   ,5.0
429,"April 18, 2011","I have bought 8 cars from Mossy and will buy my next eight also. Very professional and
no BS. Quoted me the price and I was out of there 60 minutes later, without any hassle. Why
is that some dealerships feel the need to trick you in some way? Not at Mossy, Thanks again....",5.0
430,"January 13, 2011","Going to Mossy Nissan is the biggest mistake I ever made. UNPROFESSIONAL, DISHONEST, DISRESPECTFUL!!! I didn't buy a car from them because I had a better deal and in response, they send me an email that its my ""bad karma"", which is ridiculous! I have all the right in the world to buy from wherever I want and feel comfortable with. I am so glad I didn't buy my car from them. Beware of Mr. Kirk Verrett, who is extremely pushy and who boasts about the dealership being certified by XYZ and doesn't realize its the personal experience that counts. ",1.0
431,"January 04, 2011","I really enjoy my new 2011 Altima 3.5SR.
This was the best experience buying a car. My salesman Kirk Verrett is very professional, courteous and intelligent.
He listened to what I said and worked with me without any pressure. BTW I am not an easy person to deal with.
The finance officer and entire sales team were very helpful and handled everything in an excellent manner.
I am extremely satisfied with my purchase and I will definitely recommend Mossy Nissan to my friends and family.

432,"July 08, 2010","I bought an Infiniti from these guys for what was retail price. The car was good and the salesperson was overly friendly and pushy. The car worked fine for about a year and when I went to sell it, i was told that the car had a BRANDED TITLE. The car's title had a LEMON BUYBACK flag on it. This means that the car was bought back by the manufacturer (Infiniti) because of some major defect that impairs the safety and/or driveability of the vehicle. When I tried to sell this car to other dealers, they said that they would either not buy it, because it was not a clean title OR give me HALF THE PREVAILING rate of such a car. Their rationale was that the branded title stays with the car for its life and devalues the car by more than 50%. I was NOT INFORMED about the title issues by Mossy Nissan at time of purchase. Instead, Mo Almalky simply told me that the fuel guage had to be REPLACED and the Company had done so. THIS IS VERY FOUL MISINFORMATION AND CONSUMER FRAUD SINCE A CAR OF HALF THE VALUE WAS SOLD TO ME FOR THE FULL PRICE. 

When I went to sell the car back, Alex Pourgoshtasbi, a Manager in the dealership gave me a quote that was much lower than anyone else (because he knew I could not sell it to any other dealer). He asked me to come drop the car off the next day. After numerous attempts on reaching him, Alex never answered my call requesting a time to come back. He obviously went back on the deal. 

ON MY SECOND TRIP I SAW MORE CARS THAT WERE PART OF ""LEMON BUYBACK "". PLEASE BEWARE OF THESE BRANDED TITLES WHEN PURCHASING USED CARS FROM MOSSY AND TRY TO REFRAIN BUYING CARS FROM THEM ALTOGETHER FOR THE UNETHICAL, FRAUD LIKE EXPERIENCE I HAVE HAD. ",1.8
433,"February 19, 2010","I had a wonderful experience with Mossy Nissan. Everyone was very helpful and willing to go out of their way to make sure I was completely satisfied.  I assure you that you will not be disappointed with the whole crew. I dealt with Ashton, Fritz, David, Albert, Kirk, and Brent but even if you don't have the pleasure of working with them, anyone else that is employed there will be more than helpful. As a woman, we usually hear horror stories and always feel like we need to bring a man to the dealership when we go. This was not the case as I went there alone to purchase a vehicle. I felt completely comfortable, well informed, and there was no pressure to buy right now. They understood it would be an important investment for me and allowed me to think about the choices I had. I finally decided on an Acura TSX and when I picked it up it was all cleaned and waxed. Albert sent me off with a really nice #1 key chain for my new set of keys and told me I was #1. The whole team followed up with me to make sure I was happy, even after the vehicle was purchased.  I had the pleasure of working with all these guys because they all helped each other out if one was not able to help me at that moment. It was team work!! I would definitely recommend Mossy Nissan to all of my friends and family.

434,"August 29, 2009","First I have e-mailed and a salesman named Thompson called me and agreed on a price,when I went to meet him,he said that he is busy and interduced me to Joseph Alawad and this dude was rude and jack-up the price and told me take it or leave it. I went to Russel and smith Honda and bought a CR-V no hassle no problem. Stay away from Mossy Nissan.",1.0
