55,"November 11, 2019","Just bought an X7 from another dealership and when I called BMW of West Houston to resolve a camera malfunction, the folks in service were rude and not helpful at all. All they kept saying is they don't have a loaner... I told them I didn't need a loaner, that I needed a solution (shuttle back home, rental vehicle paid by them, anything)... he kept repeating the same thing... we don't have a loaner. UNREAL! Terrible experience a few days after buying a brand new vehicle. I won't be using them again!",1.0
56,"October 08, 2019","I honestly don't know how this place is still open with the level of unprofessionalism that has occurred today. 
Took my car in to get some of the recalls. We fought the morning rush hour and got there before 8AM. Jose said they were already behind...they have only been open for 45 minutes... He said that the car would be done no later than 3PM max 3:30PM. We get a text from him at 2PM saying they HAVEN'T EVEN STARTED ON OUR CAR! And then said that they could just keep it overnight, but wouldn't give a rental car (so classy). I guess I'm supposed to walk the 46 miles to work...

We argued and said it was totally unacceptable, because they had already had our car for 6 hours and didn't do a thing. Spoke to his manager, Randy, who told us that they were putting two guys on it and it would be ready by 4:30/4:45. We show up at 4:30 and what do you know.. the car isn't ready and is still up on the jacks...AND they only did 1 of the 3 recalls!!!! It is now 6PM and still no car! There is no excuse for this complete lack of time management.  

Horrid experience, & time management. I honestly expected so much more from this BMW dealership.",1.2

58,"September 30, 2019",I had been doing research for about a week before selecting BMW. BMW of West Houston had very competitive pricing. I sent an inquiry online and  Jose contacted me on the next business day since it was a Sunday. I told him I didn't have much time for the back and forth and everything you generalizes when purchasing a vehicle. When I arrived he had four cars pulled up front so I could easily compare. He jumped around the lot looking for a car that would meet my expectations on features in addition to the price. The whole process was easy!! There were no surprises at the time to sign since everything was clearly laid out by Jose beforehand. My father who was with me struggle to walk due to back pain that Jose has had in the past as well. The next day after the purchase Jose text a few times to check on how I was doing with the new BMW 330i but even called my dad to check on him A sincere caring experience from start to whenever needed! ,5.0
59,"September 29, 2019","Went there to purchase a BMW X3; the buying process was easy, friendly and, to the point.  The only issue i had was having to wait an excessive amount of time for a technician to come explain how to pair my phone, the dealership was busy so i can understand a delay - also i didn't need that level of instruction but i suppose that is part of the standard sales process.

Been pulling into the workshop many times and every time, they will always find a way to charge me and claim It is not covered by warranty.

63,"July 09, 2019","Shopping for a BMW X3 for my wife to replace her leased Mini Cooper Clubman. She wanted a smaller SUV after having driven Mini’s for the past 9 years. We have purchased and leased BMW’s, Mercedes, Mini Coopers and Audi’s over many years and this experience was very pleasant. Mr Martell was professional, engaging and diligent at every step.

64,"May 30, 2019",Extremely frustrating and embarassing.  I was pre-approved with my CU for the loan and I was putting $10K cash down.  Your store refused to accept my down payment and CU financing letter and tried forcing me to finance with BMW to take the car.  The car was $12k and I was putting down $10k and you all put me through xxxx over $2k.  I felt untrusted as well as being taken advantage of by typical shady dealer tactics to get sales and cars financed.  I work for a CU and I promise you - I will not allow my staff to refer my members to you.  You all refuse to work with me in anyway and I think that's horrible when I know I've sent members to you with drafting instructions and/or pre-approval letters for cars.,1.5
65,"May 09, 2019","My experience at BMW of West Houston was outstanding!  I absolutely love how friendly, welcoming, and helpful all the staff was at BMW of West Houston and most importantly I love my new 2019 BMW X5.  I was originally  referred to Maria Moncada, who asked José Martell, to help me find my perfect BMW X5, which is exactly what he and Maria did, while ensuring that I was well versed on all the options available to me.  After learning all the options available on the redesigned 2019 BMW X5, I opted to build my 2019 BMW X5 with exactly the options I wanted.  My new vehicle was built and delivered to the dealership within three short weeks and I couldn’t be happier with my new BMW X5.

I wasn't sure that I would buy a new car that day but Jose put together a deal that worked perfectly for me.

He also took the time to save something I left in my old car.  ,5.0
78,"December 22, 2018","I purchased a pre owned car for me daughter 2 months ago. The salesman assured me that the mechanics check the car out completely. Drove it to Austin, the next day both rear tires looked like they were raked over a meat grinder. Put 4 new tires on it and got it aligned. Drove it to Denver, same thing tires were all bad. Took it to Big O Tires. Bought another set of tires and got it allingend again. Drove it it To Austin, same thing. At a mechanic again, all the wheel bearings were bad, so new wheel bearings another set of tires, new brakes, alignment. This has been the worst experience of a person trying to sale a car, that didn't know about it. I don't complain, but this us ridiculous. So, Beware of this dealership and it's lying sales people.",1.4

80,"October 12, 2018","Jose is the most amazing client advisor I’ve ever had to work with. He is very straight forward and has a wonderful personality...which helps when negotiating. In all my years of purchasing vehicles, I sure wish Jose would have been there for each one. 

I had never been to this amazing new dealership but was very fortunate to arrive at a time when Jose was free and available. 

He answered all my questions and ensured if other assistance was needed for a response he went and brought the person to me. 

The negotiations went well and we soon arrived at a suitable price with minimal issues. 

The finance team was equally impressive. The transaction progressed smoothly and I was soon able to depart. Jay sure knows the way to ensure an efficient process. 

Returning the next day, I meet with Jaipaul who walked me through the vehicle features. His ability to make the features easily understood are exceptional. 

The dealership overall is easily a 10....but they  have a jeweled star in Jose.  He easily exceeds a 10. 

Thanks for making the purchase process go smoothly. ",5.0

I took the car to BMW,  picked up the car on February 15th and was told there was no oil leak, and it is other cars that we have that are leaking oil. 
On my latest visit which was on June 29th, I found out the oil pipe was replaced on Feb 15th. Very disturbing!!",1.8
87,"July 09, 2018","This was one of the worst experiences I’ve ever had. I took my vehicle to this location for a fuel pump replacement due to a recall. The work on the vehicle was done improperly causing a gas leak. This could have caused an explosion because my wife and son were driving the car four hours away to Dallas without any clue. When I notified them of the situation, they did absolutely nothing to rectify the situation. The vehicle was repaired in Dallas by dealership that had nothing to do with the situation. I contacted the dealer operator Maria Moncada Alaoui over and over again and she offered no solution to the problem and didn’t seem to care at all that they put my wife and son in imminent danger. 
 Also, I purchased a maintenance package from them. I took the car there several times and was told there was nothing wrong with my vehicle. As soon as my maintenance package expired, I was told that my brake pads were installed improperly. If this is so, this is something they could’ve easily told me before the maintenance package expired. I feel like I wasted $2300 on nothing. They are not honest people and do not care about their customers! I will never take my vehicle to this location again.",1.0

89,"April 28, 2018",Was treated very badly here after purchasing a 3 series from them 2 months ago. I normally don't go to this location but today I wanted to test out how much better service was here. Refused to give me the service I asked for. Tried to talk me out of it by saying there's a very long wait time. After I insisted on waiting they tried to come up and start telling you their policy don't allow them to do this or that....UMM WHAT? What is the point of purchasing a car with warranty from them then? Manager was just as useless and brainless as them. Seriously all the people here are rude and don't know a lick about CUSTOMER SERVICE. I hope they all get replaced by more competent staff. Until then I am staying far away from this place.,1.0

91,"April 11, 2018","Due to time constraints, I only had a couple of hours to buy a car, I had done my due dilligence but they were still some unanswered questions on a BMW 428 I wanted to purchase. As everyone knows, purchasing a car is not easy. Well, Jose Martell made it not only straight to the point but super easy and comfortable. Not only did Jose knew the car, but had an itimized list of everything BMW West Houston had done to the car before putting it up for sale. If I had a question Jose didn’t know the answer, he would reassure me that he would get me the right answer and not BS around. 
Car buying should be this comfortable and simple. Non aggressive salesmen, who know their craft, who treat you like a person and not another financial transaction. BMW West of Houston has Jose Martell, he checks all those boxes. Do yourself a favor and check with Jose Martell at the front desk. He will make it happen and make you feel comfortable. I’m glad I had the opportunity to meet him, I am happy about my purchase, and how the whole process worked out and I will always recommend him as the “go to guy” In this dealer.

94,"February 26, 2018",As a disabled veteran I have to say that these are some of the most despicable people masking bad behavior and lies with niceness. My 335i caught on fire due to a recall issue while I was driving on the freeway which almost caused a horrible accident. The fire caused the car to have a meltdown and lose power on the tollway. Called the dealer to bring the car in multiple times with no response. I had to contact BMW USA directly to get them to accept my vehicle. They only replaced the recall parts and tried to charge me just to look at the electrical components that malfunctioned because of the electrical fire. BMW is refusing to fix any issue but the recalled parts because my car is not under warranty. My vehicle has less than 80k miles. This is completely un-American  Thank God for USAA. They came to my aid and will cover BMW’s evil by covering the repairs. This dealer and BMW USA has no honor! ,1.0

121,"October 06, 2017","I purchased a CPO (certified pre-owned) BMW 335i from this dealer in the Spring of 2015.  The car had a clear Carfax, it seemed in great condition.  It had a warrant for 100k miles, or 6 total years from the in-service date.  It was my 5th BMW that I purchased.  Overall, I loved the car.  

Fast forward to this fall (2017), when I'm trying to sell this car.  Buyers weren't interested in the car, so I got it appraised at a BMW dealer near me.  It came back worth $8,000 trade-in, which really surprised me.  I purchased it for over $37,000 just two years prior.  The dealer explained that it had multiple airbag deployments.  I was confused, as I had been in one accident myself, so I purchased a Carfax.  

It showed the previous owner was a lease, and it had an airbag deployment and accident during that ownership.  This means that the car should never have been sold to me as a CPO, as airbag deployments on a Carfax mean the dealership has to sell the car at an auction.  So, the car was sold for at least $10,000 more than it should have, and it should have not been a CPO.

The dealership now wants to ""appraise and buy back"" my car, but I don't trust them at all.",1.0

152,"May 30, 2017","PLEASE NOTE: The following review is based on (one) full year of experience from the dealership. 

I purchased a vehicle from this location in March 2016. Before the purchase, I would periodically visit this location to see what deals were being offered. During my visits, no one ever came out to speak or provide their contact information. *RED FLAG #1*. 

I brushed it off as them possibly being busy even though I could clearly see otherwise. Even the day of purchase, I was not greeted, offered a bottle of water, zilch. After waiting for someone for over 30 minutes, A salesmen who had previously passed me, saw me leaving and prompted someone who looked like me to come and assist me. I made it to my vehicle when Omar came out and helped me. 

FINANCE: 
I was approved with BMW Financial and have not missed a payment. Customer service is good. The only obstacle is when there are questions regarding service, warranty or etc, you have to speak with the dealership directly. 

The package I purchased includes GAP insurance. This is something that the dealership still has not provided clear details regarding what I am paying for. Only a generalization to the definition of GAP insurance was provided.  

I've called and spoken with the finance department regarding my concerns however, they provided me with minimal to no information which was very frustrating. I am unsure what their reasons were behind this, but to me something is not right. If someone is paying for additional coverage for their car, a pamphlet or printout should be provided regarding the coverage and how it works.  *RED FLAG #2*

OVERALL EXPERIENCE SINCE PURCHASE: 
Each time I visit this location, I am NEVER treated with the same respect as I have seen other ethnic groups treated. I have seen where people were greeted with a smile, given a hug or hand shake, but I was given a condescending tone. The tone I was given subliminally reads ""what do you want"", no ""Good Morning, How is your day going"" etc just pure blatant disrespect. In return, I was the one asking the personnel how their day was, to start the conversation. They don't even acknowledge me unless I spoke first. 

Based on my personal experience, I have not been afforded the respect that all customers deserve upon entering a place of business, even after the purchase. There is a big racial divide at this location. I am not happy with the service or the personnel and will ensure that my review is seen on any review-board which list this location as a reputable dealer. Each time I visit this dealership, I feel like am in 1950's fighting for the right to be treated with dignity and respect. The same dignity and respect that I see people who do not look like me receive. 

The last 15 months have been a nightmare regarding anything for my vehicle. I truly wish I would have made a different decision. People glorify that purchasing a foreign is better regarding the service received. In my personal experience, I was treated 10x's better when I purchased my Mazda!",1.4

163,"September 08, 2016","I went in on Labor Day to test drive a vehicle, briefly talked pricing and left to shop the other makes in the vehicle's class.   I returned the same day to ask some comparison questions from the same sales person I worked with earlier, Tariq Sallaq.  It was the worst experience I've ever had with a dealership regardless of whether it was a mass market or luxury brand.

The aforementioned sales associate tried to cajole me into accepting the asking price by remarking that maybe I couldn't afford the car if I was concerned about pricing.  He came full circle by disclosing his income (I didn't ask) and saying if he can afford it then why couldn't I.  Sale person also proceeded to criticize my lifestyle choices -my mistake for accepting his invitation to make light small talk earlier in the day on the test drive?   He just left after our interaction and didn't return my personal effects until prompted (ID/documentation).  

As I was walking leaving (I was polite and told him I wasn't ready to make a decision today but would return) he jeered loudly that I was playing a game and maybe if I was truly unhappy with something I should speak with the Owned Manager (Errol?) or lodge a complaint against him (I didn't -I was just intending on leaving amiably).    His gibing was overheard by the Owned manager so I replied that ""I had no complaint, and I just wanted to leave but this sales person kept tailing me and talking at my back while I was leaving.""  The owned manager flatly told Tariq that it was my decision.  As I walked to my car Mr Sallaq followed me out and at one point even put his hand on my door and kept trying to close a sale.  It was borderline harassment.",1.0

166,"July 19, 2016","I always used to think that buying a new car was a fun and empowering experience until I met Jennifer Ocampo at BMW of West Houston. My experience with her and the branch manager was filled with deception, lies, and many disappointments. My fiancée and I found a car we liked online, called Jennifer, and arranged a test drive. She stated to us that the car was having the wheels repaired and that the noise the breaks were making would be fixed after that. We loved the car and began the finance process through our bank. She called the next day to say the wheels had been fixed. Therefore, we made the three hour drive back to the dealership to find that the car was making the exact same noise.. Jennifer stated she was somehow misinformed about what all was being repaired, but that she would have it done the following Monday. She stated that to secure the car we needed all the paperwork to go through with the bank, so we did that on Friday with plans to pick up the car the following Monday. All the while Jennifer continued to pressure us into not financing through our bank, and to finance through BMW, which we were adamant we did not want to do. However, she repeatedly and quite rudely continued to pressure us until the whole family was uncomfortable with her persistence and my mother-in-law finally told her to stop asking. Monday morning we got a call from Jennifer stating that the sound wasn't fixed because ""that's just the sound some brakes make."" My fiancée asked for a manager to call him, which he did, and my fiancée explained the sound, which is definitely not normal. The manager said he would go drive the car himself to hear the noise and then call us back. The phone call from the manager never came, instead we were graced with a call from Jennifer stating that the car sold. Jennifer stated that she told us it was marked sold because she thought everything was complete but apparently there was something else that needed to be done that she was unaware of. None of this makes any sense to me. Like how could we essentially BUY the car, have it marked sold, and be on our way to pick it up when someone else buys it... Only to receive a phone call saying sorry, we sold the car don't bother coming to pick it up. There was no follow up from management, who stated he was going to drive the car then call us before we came to get it. Clearly the man leading this team has no idea how to actually run a business or manage his employees and is more intune with running a scam(see all the other fraud/scam reviews for this place). My conclusion is that one of two things happened. Either, they realized that they could not fool us into buying the car with bad breaks/rotors, and they found someone who would, or they found someone willing to finance through BMW when we would not, thus increasing their sales profits. Either way we were told that the car was marked sold for us, and then it sold on our way to pick it up. We were left with no follow through by management or by Jennifer. I would never recommend this dealership to anyone and cannot believe the lack of customer service we received when trying to spend 42k on a car. Save yourself the headache, scams, and deception...

I was asked to come by to check those cars that I previously inquired about.  So I did.  But only being told by the sales associate not to come here with the list of six cars.  I already discussed about those six cars with his sales manager and explain why I am interested over phone and emails.  Nothing was communicated to the sales associate at the showroom.  I was told by the sales assistant to come here with only one or two cars at most to check after enough studying the cars I want.  He even made offensive comments including his response to my question related with discount possibly different from car to car.  To make the story short, after listening to his complaints and waiting for hour and a half, I became tired and left this dealership with not being able to see even one single car from the list.  I was told some cars were not available and he eventually did not come back while I was left alone at their show room, just waiting.  Obviously to him,  his time was a lot more important than mine.

169,"May 11, 2016","I have a 750 LI, I have been taking it to  this BMW dealer for the past 1 1/2 yrs. The service i received Monday was disgusting to the BMW standard and name. They are so rude and what they consider a courtesy is not a courtesy. Jeb does not need to manage anything (Please be aware that if its free you are not expected to hold them accountable for there lack of workmanship and attention to your car). Jeb made it clear that if its a free or courtesy service and its either not done or 1/2 done... That okay because it FREE.  I guess your lucky to even get it in the garage since your not paying for any service. He also informed that he has to pay his technicians so how could he pay them if we are getting a ""courtesy service"". I am BEYOND upset with this dealer and even though i didn't want anything for ""Free"" all I was asking is that they fix what they said they did when I DID ""pay"" for the service and I DIDNT get. I have payed thousands of dollars for ""SERVICE"" and clearly they have lied about what they are saying they are checking. He insisted I wanted it done for free.. I guess he couldn't see past his own ignornat ways. They have no idea that they have lost a CUSTOMER for life due to there customer service. After I spoke to Jeb I also spoke to Randy which then Diagnosed my car ( of which i still had to pay the $165 fee for his tech to look into it I guess I needed to pay his 5 hours for looking at my car like Jeb said )  and came back with $7500 Estimate or i could trade it in. After I thought this was insulting because what they said they checked the last year and half is what was causing these issues and I feel like they gave this huge estimate to then tell me to trade it in.  Whats even funnier is that I asked them to just give me my car and I would be on my way... well just like every thing else at that service center it was 1/2 done they didn't even screw my engine cover (no screws ) on and they lost some kind of clamps. I then took it to the BMW on 59 and they said i didn't even need $7500 worth ( that the estimate that they gave me was ridiculous)  they only said  I needed a few parts and it wasn't a big deal all of that work would cost me $600, and even though I didn't get it fixed at the 59 BMW that day they didn't charge me the fee to look at my car. The amount of labor charged at the BMW WEST is a robbery.  So this tells me that they just wanted to get me out of the dealership and startle me ( what a way to scare customers into paying a crazy amount when it didn't even need it.. very reputable) . This is a testament to the standard of service that they give. DO NOT GO HERE TO GET ANYTHING FIXED. You are better off going to the BMW on 59 they know what service is and they treat you with respect, courtesy and they care about your concerns. I GUESS THIS IS THE NEW BMW WEST STANDARD !! BMW has always had such a high standard of work and this is subpar, unacceptable work is beyond disappointing. I don't know that I will ever look at BMW the same. All I wanted was for them to fix what they said they checked every single time my car came to the shop.

BMW service rep said it was 1st time they use his service and yet I paid for that trial, that visit the car had 48,500 mils and specifically asked the service rep to check everything before warranty expires, the report came back as everything OK and nothing is needed. The car has now 53.500 and front brakes and rotor needs replacement after 5000 miles from last inspection, clearly they did not do any inspection, even though paper work said it was done. I argued with service manager since his technician did not do what they asked to do when I brought the car last time and as consequence I am having to replace parts and labor. He finally agreed to deduct the labor, yet he declined to admit that his team did not perform properly, insisted that I should pay for the parts and insulting my intelligence by say “so many things could happen the car in 5000 miles driving” really a brake pads and rotors can suddenly deteriorate within 5000 miles! I also had to wait few ours for the car as I was promised a loaner and when I checked in I was told they do not offer a loaner when it is out of a warranty.  Advise, buy the car there but take it somewhere else for the service. The new location is a bit fancy, but do not be impressed, the service and attitude does not match up at all.  ",1.2
171,"March 08, 2016","I have given this place 4 chances with my car to have service work done and every time it is always something. It either takes 30 minutes to an hour to drop the car off (with an appointment), I never get phone calls from the service advisers as to when the car is done or what work is recommended (I have to continue to call for updates), it takes another 30 minutes to and hour to pick the car up, and finally it seems like the service advisers have a poor attitude about taking care of customers. I really get a sense that your business is not appreciated or they have better things to do instead of taking care of paying customers. I have been through 4 service advisers who I have had the same issue with over and over again with the things I stated above. To top everything off, I finally had it after this last visit and decided to let the service manager Randy know about my experiences and that I will not be coming back ever again. He sat down and listened to my concerns and offered me a 20% discount on my future services along with a rental car which sounded okay (I can get 10% with the coupon on the their website, so he is only giving me an extra 10% off for 4 bad experiences I have had which I later realized is not enough). Well I drive my car home after speaking to him about my experience and realize the clock on my dash and all the settings/time on my radio are gone. It looks like they decided to disconnect my battery during an oil change causing me to lose everything that I had setup on my new radio. No one informed me of this and I think I know why they did, they couldn't figure out how to turn my alarm off. I explicitly told my adviser Gabe how to turn the alarm off and how to keep it from going off, but I guess their BMW techs and advisers either can't listen to directions or can figure out how to hit an unlock button on the key fob to turn the alarm off... I called Randy as I was driving home to explain even more frustration about the experience after finding out everything had been lost in my radio since the battery was disconnected. That was Saturday afternoon that I left a message to have him call me and I have not heard anything back.

Numerous calls to both the sales guy and the sales manager were completely ignored. Even after going back to the dealership in person and speaking to the sales manager it was basically told “too bad so sad”. 

Buying a used car at BMW of West Houston (and any other Sonic Automotive dealership for that matter) is a crapshoot. It would stand to reason that buying at a dealership would be safer than on Craigslist but no so with BMW West - at least on Craigslist the transaction would have been considerably quicker.

173,"November 18, 2015","
I purchased a used car from these guys.  Short story, DO NOT DO SO.  Look elsewhere.

The long story -- I had to fly in to pick up the car, so I asked if there was anything that would preclude me from driving it back across the country.  They said no.  They had replaced the tires and everything else was good.  I also asked if there was any scratches, or nicks that were not clear in the photographs.  Again I was told no.  

When I arrived, the front lower bumper was broken.  This was not clear in the photos and I would certainly have expected it to be mentioned when I asked about paint imperfections.  So, I still purchased the car knowing that I would be out of pocket several hundred dollars to replace it.

During the sales process they kept pushing their wheel and tire warranty.  I mean REALLY pushing it.  I didn't purchase it since these are almost always a waste of money.  In this case they wanted me to buy it because they ALREADY KNEW THE WHEELS WERE BENT.

The big issue became apparent several miles down the road once the road became smoother.  There was a vibration that felt like the wheels were improperly balanced.  No big deal, so I pull in to a Discount Tire shop to have them balanced.  Turns out they were already perfectly balanced, AND BENT.  

There is NO way that they would have been perfectly balanced if they had been bent after the new tires were mounted and balanced.

So BMW of West Houston clearly balance the bent wheels when the put on the new tires.  Since the bend was on the inside, it wasn't visible and they decided I'd be miles away before I noticed due to the bad roads around the dealership.

After contacting them, they first tried to blame me.  ""I must have run over something"".  I didn't.  Then after I pushed the issue, they asked how much it would be to get them straitened.  I spent the time to take the wheels to 2 different wheel repair places.  They couldn't be repaired.  So I had to purchase 2 new wheels, so now I'm out of pocket more than $2000.

I contacted them to let them know, the sales guy ""had to ask his manager"" and after that they stopped responding.

If you have a warranty and bring it in then the technicians will send you on your merrily way and tell you there is nothing wrong with your car. I only giving a one star that is not deserve because the receptionist has had to deal with my multiple phone calls. Be sure to read all the one star  reviews esp. the tire reviews and the doctor's review. I bought a certified 328i in March 2015 from BMW West in Katy, TX and have taken it back 7-8 times for light malfunction, left lower wheel low tire pressure x 4, smoke coming out of exhaust and now a drive train malfunction.  They told me there was nothing wrong with my car. Well after getting stuck on the road one week after they told me nothing was wrong with my tire, I took it to Discount Tires and they showed my husband that the tire was totally flat inside and couldn't hold air, so we bought another tire for my safety.  Now two weeks later after car was serviced by BMW, my car is there for a drive train malfunction and his incident happen on Thursday morning 9/3/2015 at approximate 830 am as I was going to meeting at my corporate office.  I was on  Grand Pkwy 99 going up on the spaghetti overpass to West park tollway and my car would not accelerate to the top of the overpass, finally I got to the top and had to coast down as my car as it began shaking and cutting off as I got to the shoulder and was unable to make it to the first exit because I was on the overpass before Peek Rd. I was panicking.  I called the roadside assistance and was on hold for 20 minutes and then finally called the dealership and as I was waiting I asked the receptionist about the roadside asst phone no. Apparently the wrong roadside asst (Florida) is set up in my car. I called the roadside asst and they answered immediately and they came with 60 minutes as my husband was waiting for them. By the way they claim they do not to have any loaner cars then or today.  Hey Jed Newsome, Cash, John Swann are you or your technicians ASE certified? Do ya'll have a computer assisted device to find out what's wrong with someones car? Do you always lie and tell people anything?

I brought it over and the maintenance employee told me that all BWM use a lot of cooling fluid and I had to have extra fluid with me in the car. after bringing the car 2 times they finally changed the fluid container because it was cracked. I wonder how it broke down a week later if they pitch is ""Pre-own Certified""? did they check it or they knew and did not want to fix it until it was purchased? a few months later I brought the car for service and it was a disaster from the moment I went into their garage nothing they promised was delivered. The second time I brought it for service they called me and told me that one of the spot lights was broken and it will cost me $350 to replace it. I was almost positive the light was not broken before I brought it in but not 100%. I replaced the spot light on my own. I brought my wife's X5 last week and I checked it before I brought it in due to the past experiences and stupid me did not check it when I picked it up,  Guess what happened? exactly, another spot light was broken and realized it when I got home. It is weird that the head lights are 20 times bigger than the spot lights and have never been broken. So I called and although the service associate was  nice, his manager said that they could do nothing for me and he let me know. The only reason why I kept coming back to this dealership was because is the only one in west Houston (Katy) however with this experience I'll never comeback and will recommend my friends to watch out and take their cars somewhere else.

However, the Mr. Vela stated that their mechanics had done a thorough inspection of the car and there was no need. Additionally, he added that the car was safe to drive and in good working condition because the dealership could not sell a car that was not safe to drive and working.
Three weeks after purchasing the car, the transmission went out. I had only driven the car 500 hundred miles. Most of the miles were from driving the car from Katy to Austin. I have been quoted $6,300 to fix the transmission by BMW of Austin. So basically, I spent several thousands of dollars in purchasing a large paper weight. In order to have a running car, I will need to spend several thousand dollars more. 
To add insult to injury, when I attempted to contact Mr. L.R. Vela about the issue so that I could at minimum receive some guidance from their service department; Mr. Vela ignored me. When I communicated that I was unhappy with my purchase and that I would need to pay an additional $6,300 to fix the car he had sold me 3 weeks earlier he just blew me off and hung up.
This has been the worst car purchasing experience I have ever had. I have purchased 7 cars in my lifetime 3 of which were used prior to this one and I have never had an issue. These salesmen are thieves and so is the dealership.
I would never purchase a BMW again nor would I purchase anything from BMW of West Houston. Beware if you plan on visiting BMW of West Houston.

DO not ever even thinking about buying car form this guy.

He's not responding my call for the after service since its been 1 and half week. 

I had hard water stain on my car, i just could not notice because it was rainy day. Right after i noticed it, i tried to call the sales person n left message but he s not calling me back at all.  I need to spend more than 100 dollars to remove water stain that i just bought from there. 

They told me they will clean the car before i get handed in, which was xxxxxxxx. 

No response from that at all. 

Avoid that sales person!!  I can't forget what he told me when i was on processing of buying car.  ",1.6

185,"September 19, 2013","I came into this dealership after my car was totaled and had no idea what direction to go. My salesperson, David Tubbs, was great!! He took time to analyze what I liked, what my needs were, and he helped me pick a wonderful car. The time I spent, the price I paid and just the overall care and concern and the knowledge of the sales rep was definitely a plus. I have recommended this dealership and sales rep several times to my friends and family and have never been disappointed ",5.0
186,"September 19, 2013","This man was AWESOME! I've bought many cars and trucks, but this experience with David Tubbs was the best I've ever experienced. He is very knowledgable about the car I bought and very helpful about the features. I have recommended several of my friends to him. David Tubbs, in opinion is ""The Man"" he sold me a car, without the ""salesman"" pitch. I affirmatively will buy my cars from now on from David.",4.0
187,"May 30, 2013","Khalil was great, I tried contacting the same dealer three times before I finally got a hold of him that would respond to me and was more than willing to work with me from Austin. He would be the only one I would recomend, along with the finance guy I worked with. Other than that the customer service called three times and promised me they would have someone contact me and never did, if it wasnt for me REALLY wanting this car I still would never have got the phone call back. Khalil was WONDERFUL!!!",4.8
188,"April 14, 2013","After having a terrible experience with Advantage BMW Midtown (see posted review) I contacted Minh Nguyen over at Momentum West, I explained our situation and he along with his finance team was able to get us out of our originally leased 531i and into a beautifully loaded X5; additionally we traded our Infiniti M37s and leased a 135is. We received extremely fair trade $ for both vehicles and excellent prices on the new vehicles. Momentum BMW West is fair and  honest; if your looking for a new BMW see Minh Nguyen he will take care of you!",5.0
189,"October 22, 2012","I bought my pre-owned BMW M5 from Momentum BMW West in 2009, along with an extended warranty. Until recently, my car had always been serviced at this dealership. I did not mind paying the higher cost to keep my car running properly and I trusted Momentum BMW West to ensure my M5 was serviced properly and in a professional manner. Initially, things went pretty well, but there came a time when the car began to have a recurring problem with increased emissions, which started at about 70k miles. The increased emissions fault code would appear and then disappear. Whenever the light came on, I would take the car to Momentum within ONE day. Between 70k and 81k miles, I brought my car to Momentum’s service department numerous times regarding this same recurring problem and voiced my frustration with the issue. They assured me on every occasion they would get the problem resolved. I became somewhat frustrated with my service advisor regarding the numbers of occurrences associated with this particular problem and their failure to repair the problem. On one occurrence, Momentum changed the CO2 sensors at 78k miles, at the cost to me of several hundred dollars. But, the problem returned soon afterwards, which suggested to me that they had not properly diagnosed and repaired the problem at all. I continued to bring my car back to them on numerous occasions regarding this issue. Then, at 81k miles, they told me that ONE of the catalytic converters needed to be replaced. Up to that point, they had never mentioned anything to me about any potential problems regarding the catalytic converters. They explained to me that had the problem been diagnosed prior to 80k miles, replacement of the catalytic converter would have been covered under a warranty. Since the car had 81k miles, the replacement would cost me several thousand dollars. I was quite upset that their service department failed to diagnose the problem within the 80k mile warranty period. I voiced my disappointment in the manner in which this problem had been handled. The service manager then told me he would look to see if there was something they could do to lessen the expense. It took several weeks and numerous emails and phone calls before they got back to me, but they offered to absorb some of the cost to replace one converter. I was not satisfied with their offer. They declined any negotiation on their offer and then simply stopped responding to my attempts to contact them. They absolutely stopped returning my calls and my emails. I then took my car to their sister BMW dealership, located on Hwy 59. Momentum Southwest took a look at the car and diagnosed that BOTH converters needed to be replaced at a retail cost of more than $13,000. They offered a reduced price of $8,500. They explained that Momentum BMW West not only misdiagnosed the problem, but did not provide me with the correct catalytic replacement requirements. I then took my car to yet another repair shop (not a dealership), which specializes in BMW repair. Their mechanics also diagnosed both converters needed to be replaced. I then went back to Momentum BMW West, walked into the service department and spoke directly with the service manager with my findings. He agreed to take yet another look at my car. This time, they agreed BOTH converters needed to be replaced. I asked that they provide me with a reasonable offer to correct the problem. The service manager explained he would make every effort to come up with a workable solution. However not only did he not contact me again, but he refused to respond to all of my attempts to contact him by email or phone. Momentum BMW West NEVER contacted me with any offer to replace both converters. I am completely dissatisfied with the lack of professionalism I experienced at this dealership and would not recommend them to anyone.",1.8
190,"August 23, 2012","Absolutely not recommended. 
I stopped by to see an SUV they advertised online. When I went there, the vehicle was sold already. They always list their vehicle on ebay. It says still available on ebay. Later that night, the same exact vehicle showed up as a new listing on ebay. I sent a message if the vehicle is available, they said it was sold but they were trying to sell me another car, completely different model from what I was looking for. I sent a message to them why the vehicle was re-listed because I knew it was already sold at the dealer ship. No answer but the listing is still there.
They use bait and switch type method. 
Check ebay rating, their score is 73% positive feedback. 
Another complaint, don't expect to get a call back when you ask the sales manager to call you",1.0

193,"March 23, 2012","DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION Every individual I came in contact with (except the guys who open the door in service wearing blue shirts) was VERY RUDE and UNPROFESSIONAL! 

I purchase my key at their location because it is closest. Once the key arrived they told me they would assist me in activating the key to my car by phone due to the fact my car was locked and I could not get inside.

So I call the location and tell them I am ready to be instructed as to how I activate the key so that I can finally unlock and drive my car. She states that he will call me back and they never does. MIND YOU:  minutes earlier I had just paid a tow guy $50.00 to get into the car because you had to be inside to activate it.

They cost me an additional 50.00 and headache! I have to say I have never been treated so poorly. STEER CLEAR of this place!

UPDATE:: The next morning I was contacted by ANDREW the service manager at the Southwest Freeway location and he was so nice and professional. He apologized for another locations behavoir and sent someone to my location to open the car and acctivate the key. I was totally in shock because the other location could care less. Im soo happy with ANDREW THE SERVICE MANAGER AT THE SOUTHWEST FREEWAY LOCATION. They cared when no one else did. ",1.0
194,"December 05, 2011","Repeated problems honoring service appointment times. I suspect something fishy this time because they are telling me both rear tires need replaced to pass state inspection.

196,"December 14, 2010","Sales:
Dealership was very difficult to work with.  Saw a car on their lot that I liked and the salesman said it only needed to go through the CPO process and he could sell it to me.  Ended up taking almost a week.  Must not have needed the sale.  I was then given a somewhat low offer for my trade in and they refused to budge on price.  I would have gladly gone elsewhere, but I wanted a manual transmission, and this was one of maybe 6 in all of Houston!

Service:
Right off the bat, the iPod cable to integrate my iPod with IDrive didn't work.  I was told that even though they sold me the car with the cable, it was installed at a BMW dealer, the parts used were from BMW, and the car had passed CPO inspection, the repair for the cable would be $300, all for an hour of reprogramming.  And this was on my second or third trip to the dealership to have this repair done, each time with a different service advisor, who knew nothing about the vehicle history and had to run his own checks.  I ended up taking it to another dealership who fixed the problem under warranty without any argument.  The other issue I had was a brake squeal.  Three times I took it to this dealership, and each time I ended up waiting over 3 hours just to be told they couldn't hear the noise.  I took it to the dealership I go to now, and they fixed the squeal and replaced the brakes without hesitation.  Also, they were always very reluctant to give me loaner cars.  The dealership I take my car to now gives them out like they're going out of style.

There are so many BMW dealers in the Houston area, you'd have to be a masochist to use this one.
