1,"March 28, 2020","I was in a car accident in late January in my 2019 Chevrolet Camaro. The fault was of the other driver. I chose to bring my car here for service because this is where I have always brought my car for service for the past 6 years. Even my prior vehicle which was my 2014 Chevrolet Camaro THAT I BOUGHT THERE. This was my first car accident ever. ""Pete"" in Service released the car to me once it was done and I was good to go. It was to my knowledge it was all taken care of by the idiot's car insurance company that hit me. WRONG!!!! They decide to call me ONE MONTH LATER to tell me I owe the dealership $1000 dollars or they are going to take LEGAL ACTION AGAINST ME. Apparently the insurance company sent ME (not the dealership) a check that I was supposed to give to the dealership for payment on my car, even though the dealership had already been paid $11,000 thousand dollars for the repairs. Pardon my ignorance, but this being my first accident, I had no idea. No one from either party informed me of this. PETE from SERVICE calls me A MONTH LATER after the car had already been released back to me to tell me that I owed them $1000 for the repairs and that if I did not pay them legal action would be taken against me. Mind you this happened March 26 after I had just found out I lost my job due to the Coronavirus pandemic, WHICH I TOLD THEM! (They laughed about it). So I called WALTER who is supposedly the ""service manager"" to let him know of the circumstances and to see what could be done. I told him I am a man of my bills and always pay my debts. I had full intentions to pay my debts. I had no idea I owed them anything. THEY RELEASED THE CAR TO ME!! I told him I did not have the money to pay him and WALTER's response was ""WELL YOU CAN JUST BRING ME YOUR CAR AND WE CAN KEEP POSSESSION OF IT UNTIL YOU CAN PAY US"" are you kidding me? How disgusting. I begged him to speak with the owner because I was even willing to work out a payment plan but he refused to call me back and I had to show up in person. I ended up having to borrow money from a family member because I was mis-guided by their DISGUSTING terrible service department. When I showed up to speak to him about it in person he could not even look me in the eye and speak to me directly and instead pushed me off to his poor secretary in the front who had nothing to do with it and had to take the brunt of my frustration. WALTER (who again is supposedly the service manager) told me it was my fault and that I should have known I owed this balance. How disgusting. My family of 6 and I have all taken our cars here for service for 10 plus years and I can GUARANTEE that we will NEVER EVER bring ANY business to this DISGUSTING dealership again. WALTER AND PETE HAVE DISGUSTING CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS and you as Dealership should be ashamed. And then whenever I FINALLY CAME and paid in full he was scrambling in his office because I asked for a simple paid in full receipt. Scam artists. Terrible. And to treat someone like this after they just lost their job due to a nation wide pandemic?? Pathetic. What a horrible excuse for dealership. I will take my business to CLASSIC in GALVESTON where they actually have morals. Disgusting!! TOTALLY DISGUSTING. Whoever the owner of Norman Frede is should be ashamed.",1.0

5,"February 06, 2020","I was going to buy a new 2020 vehicle and due to a work obligation I couldn't make it in that evening and planned on going the next day, well during that process they sold the vehicle when I already has financing and wanted me to send by text my credit card front and back to secure another vehicle...NO that's how identity theft happens and my bank said that was very inappropriate to text someone that vital information.

Sat for hours in the typical, frustrating ‘game’, missing Norman Frede team’s sincere, honest and helpful environment. If only my car had been there... Never again will I leave! They are rare and #1!

12,"August 02, 2018",David informed me every step of the way and answered every question he could and directed me to other employees for their expertise if it was outside his field of knowledge. Because of the service crew and the collision center I will go to Norman Frede for my next Chevy. Thank you for all the hard work and outstanding service. Both are immensely appreciated!,5.0
13,"August 01, 2018","The service manager, David, did an excellent job of keeping us informed as to the progress of the repair and any changes in scope during the repair.  The technician Pavel did an outstanding work on the repair.  All of his work was top notch and the vehicle is even better than new!",5.0
14,"June 29, 2018","Having been a former employee at NFC, I enjoyed the experience. Working there was like having an extended family and a learning center of selling and developing skillsets in a reward based job. Edgar presented himself smoothly, not pushy, but rather extending a friendly hand of welcome to Mr. Frede's house. There have been many great persons working here and an uncommonly length of employment in the transportation line of business.  
As much as everyday things change, sales and service remains same at NFC, customer's welcomed and treated as fair as possible and welcomed to the Frede Chevrolet family!
Thank you for a great experience in car buying from the other side of the desk!

15,"June 16, 2018","In life there are several things I dislike doing. Doing taxes, renewing license, going to funerals, and the two tied for number 1 going to the dentist and buying a car!
In the last two days buying a car has come off the list.  My sales lady Ana Villa was fantastic!  And the “evil finance folks” were unbelievable!  I got great and timely service on both trucks I bought. Well I didn’t take home two trucks but I took one home on day and changed to a different one the next day. 😎. Everyone knows of the hours usually spent buying a vehicle , but it took less than a hour and half on each. They were very respectful of my time and requirements.   The staff at Norman Frede can only be described by one word. GROOVY!  
Thank you again for your efforts and success at making this a totally enjoyable experience.

16,"March 02, 2018","My family has been trying to get their Corvett  fixed for months now.  The dealership kept it for weeks and then when they got it home within a week it was not working again.  They called the dealership and they told them they would send someone to pick it up.  They picked it up and towed it back to the dealership and later you called and said it would be another $648.00 to fix it and they would have to pay the towing service too!  I think this is bad business when you take advantage of older people that don't understand the situation.  I was at their home the day this happened and I could have had it towed for FREE.  I think ya'll should have paid for the towing and to fix the problem that they had ""again"".  This is over $7000 that they have paid to repair this car.  I think you could have cut them some slack on charges that they shouldn't have to pay!!!!!!!",1.0
17,"January 25, 2018","I made my appointment with Danny, he was very kind and friendly , even know ( as a woman+ car) I didn’t know what I was talking about he stayed kind and helpful.
Trever was the one taking care of the problem with my car. He is excellent!!!!! Kind, helpful and very friendly. He truly cares about his customers. Outstanding service there.
All of this would of been a headache if Linda wouldn’t help me set up my visit and tell me about Norman Frede Chevrolet.
Thank you !",5.0
18,"January 02, 2018","The team got me a great deal on a 2018 Traverse and were friendly and helpful the entire way through, making sure to give me as much information as possible and answer all of my questions. I had a great experience and walked away happy! Would purchase from again!",5.0

22,"November 22, 2017","I bought a 2017 a Grand Sport Corvette.  I purchased it on Wednesday inspected it told the dealership I would pick it up on Friday.  Well I pick it up on Friday afternoon, I was in a hurry because I had to pickup my daughter from school, and I drive it straight home and put it in the garage  jump in my truck to pick my daughter up from school. Next morning a few friends come over to look at the car and as they are admiring it, one says, man there is a scratch on your car.  I immediately call the dealership and speak to Darren the Sales manager.  He ask me to bring the car in and wants to look at the car.  He looks at the car and asks me to bring back on Wednesday my day off so he can get the body shop to look at it.  Body shop manager states the bumper needs to be repainted scratches are too deep.  The body shop manager then tells me the dealership is not paying for it I have to.  I immediately go talk to Darren and he states I  am a liar and they will not fix the scratched bumper end of story.  
Now mind you I have purchased several vehicles from this dealership and have had several of my vehicles serviced here for the better part of 20 years.  Never again. The service and sales department used to be excellent. Not anymore.  They have lost a long term customer.  ",1.4

24,"November 04, 2017","I made an online reservation for an Oil Change and Multipoint Inspection on my 2017 Tahoe and received a confirmation and a reminder but when I arrived they had no record of the reservation and didn't seem particularly concerned. After finally deciding to do the work the Oil Change took nearly an hour and there was no mention of the Multipoint Inspection having been completed. The Service Advisor was friendly but the service overall was quite lackluster. As far as I know, the service has never been entered into the myChevy database, I had to do it myself.",3.6
25,"October 01, 2017",I took my camaro to Norman Frede Chevrolet and I was very pleased with Trever who kept everything on point for me. He called me every day to let me know what's happening with my car.I had no worries. I also got Excellent customer service from Linda ( from the office) and Jose who gave me rides from and to the dealership. I can highly recommend this place to anyone!!!,5.0
26,"August 23, 2017",Gregg McAlpine and Eddie Cox are the best. Eddie and I have know each other for several years now and Gregg makes you feel like you've know him forever. Not once did I ever get the feeling of being  high pressured into making a decision. Everyone at the dealership always goes above and beyond to help you in anyway they can and a great customer experience is what’s it’s all about. It’s the difference between a one time sale and a life long customer. A big part of our decision to come back to Norman Freede Chevrolet is their outstanding service department. The service department can make it or break it if there's no service after the sale.,5.0

29,"June 12, 2017"," This dealership is the opposite of what you think of when you think of a used car dealership.  They're very honest and quick to respond to your concerns about the vehicle you're purchasing.  And the vehicles on their lot or well-maintained and  quickly repaired if needed, so I bought an SUV with confidence  the process is very fast, and you do not have to plan a whole day wasted just buying a car.

31,"April 29, 2017",I came in to buy a vehicle for my daughter and she has specifics that I could not find. I surveyed your website and came across the perfect vehicle. I found a Ford F-150 Black on black and lifted just as she wanted... I spoke to KT and he took me on a test drive and was very professional.

34,"April 09, 2017","A not-so-ideal ideal Saturday morning turned out just fine, thanks to Norman Frede's service center and Allan Reinartz in particular. My car started to overheat while running errands;I was able to get in touch with the service center immediately and drop my car off before closing. Allan was incredibly helpful and got me taken care of as soon as possible the following week. Five stars for friendliness, communication, efficiency, and overall awesomeness! ",5.0

45,"January 30, 2017","My wife and I thought the dealership was closed and decided to drive through the parking lot to look at Tahoes. We had no intent to buy one that night. We were greeted by Jimmy, who did not pressure us into anything. He helped us figure out a ballpark estimate on payments and took down information about exactly what we were looking for. As Jimmy looked up the value for my trade in my wife looked up the value on Kelley Blue Book. After all the numbers had been crunched we learned there was a Tahoe meeting all our specifications for sale. Jimmy gave us adequate time alone to discuss what we wanted to do and continued to not pressure us into buying right then. We decided we could not find a more fair price on the Tahoe of my dreams or our trade in. Jimmy, Pastor, and Audrey stayed well past closing time to finish the deal. They were all super polite and made us feel right at home! Jimmy took pictures for us and kept in touch after the sale.",5.0

On arriving on the car lot a salesman came immediately and asked if he could assist me. His name was Nathan Cook. He was very friendly and had a great smile. He showed me the vehicle I saw on line but it was very small. He showed me several more which I did not like but then he showed me a 2009 Saturn Vue. This car was in excellent condition interior and exterior, engine runs good no problems. The price was right. I did a test drive. I really fell in love with it and knew it was perfect for my granddaughter. On Friday I returned with my son and granddaughter and they really liked it. Nathan showed them everything and took them on a test drive. My granddaughter fell in love with it.  I purchased the car. They worked with us financially and  made it easy for me to purchase.

Relatively quick car buying experience even considering they stayed late since we couldn't get there until late in the evening. 
Recieved multiple calls over the following weeks to ensure we were happy with our purchase and to make sure we didn't have any questions. 

When I returned to pick up my plates and have my vehicle cleaned Zach was there again - ready with my plates as I walked in the door.

106,"October 04, 2016","While this may be controversial, my truck voltage gauge for first 500 miles was consistant. Then after changing wheels, I lost my TPSM reading. After a couple of attempts by the dealership the problem returned. Then I notice my voltage was dropping to low out puts for long periods with or without  everything running. I called the dealership that evening (Saturday). Was told that the service department was closed. I would have to get a wrecker to bring my truck in on Monday. Wasn`t offered a rental or even asked if I had transportation. Which I didn`t.  I didn`t trust my truck to get me to and from work and had to hitch a ride.  Next morning at start up. Engine ran horrible. But voltage was good. motor started to run better after about 15 minutes of idling.  Later that morning engine temp spiked up. I took it in to service department. The service rep ,without getting out of his chair said that is normal and I should just drive my truck. After a long argument with him and the salesman. The service manager finally showed up. Very nice man. Hooked up his computer to the truck. And said that things seem to be normal. Then later he said the BCM was bad. The service rep said no loaners available. And tried to deter me from getting a rental through them. I googled the BCM. This problem could leave you stranded. Bad service doesn`t justify a good sale price. Other people waiting on vehicles were upset. One lady had been waiting for over 2 hours to get her oil changed. Finally she went looking for her car. A man was yelling at another service rep about his transmission. This seems to be business as usual there. The service manager told the service rep it would take him 3 days to repair it. And the part had to be ordered. I was transported over to enterprise. They said that the car was payed for by Norman Frede for 3 days. Another problem for me. They don`t even have the part yet! I was teated like gold before purchase. Afterwards. I was told to drive the truck until it quits. Never had these problems with  GMC/Buick dealership.",1.5

Too my surprise he didn't give the answer that I was expecting, the normal we can't help you unless you give a big down payment. He actually took the time to look for options that could help me out. After a week going back and forward with different options and ways to help me out. Zachary and the Norman team came together with a solution to put me in a vehicle that I like and enjoy.

It was also the easiest way to deal with the financing. I like the way they get all the paper work ready ahead of time so that when you walk into his office everything is ready to go and you don't have to sit around and wait for him to try to talk you into things.

265,"May 27, 2016","I had been looking for a pretty specific used vehicle, for a while, that fit my desire. That would be a fairly new Toyota Tacoma double cab with a v6. I found one on their lot but it was well out of my price range. The salesman I was speaking with, Edgar Urias, told me about another Tacoma they had just received that fit the description, but wasn't ready to be shown yet. They had just gotten it in. He told me it would be ready the following day, but I had to work so I couldn't make it. I told them I would be able to get back 2 days later, so they waited to put it out on the lot. When I was able to back it back I got to look at the truck, and it was pretty much everything I wanted. I knew a 4wd was just well out of my price range and since I would rarely use it anyway was looking for a 2wd, and this was exactly everything else I wanted. When I was told the price I knew it too was fairly well outside of my price range, considering I was upside down by a few thousand dollars on my trade in. I told Edgar this and thanked him for holding it for me to get a chance to see it, and was about to go home. He stopped me, and asked what my comfort zone was in a monthly payment. With that number in mind he asked me to wait and see if he could work out a deal for me. As anyone who as ever bought a car from a dealership before can attest it takes some time. Knowing this I decided I could wait a bit. I gave him a couple hours and with a little push and pull he was able to work out a deal from what was originally going to be, and by all rights should be based on what I had seen elsewhere, more than I could afford. He made a deal for me, that was in my comfort range, on a vehicle I have been wanting. I am very happy with my experience, and purchase. Thank you Edgar and the folks from Norman Frede.",5.0

302,"November 30, 2015","I've been to this dealership at least three previous times since living in this area (30+ years).  In every single case I left early in the process because what I viewed as high-pressure tactics (old school).  I was in the market for a nice Equinox, I wanted to see one in person before deciding.  I randomly stopped at Norman Fredde because it was convenient with the intent of not speaking to anyone.  Nevertheless Tommy approached me and volunteered to open the car up to look at it (no pressure).  I spent about 5 minutes looking at it and said my good bye (still no pressure).

After a few more days of research, I decided I was going to purchase an Equinox, had already found one at another dealership that was a fair price.  Before heading out there I took a look at Norman Frede options and noticed the car I believed was the one I saw at a very fair price.  So I email Tommy to confirm if that was the same car.  I told him I'd like to test drive it.  And the rest was history.  Through out the process I didn't experience any high pressure sales tactics, including the extended warranty items I know the dealerships love to sale (but I never buy).  Point is that I my tolerance was very low to kind of high pressure sales encounter and was impressed it was absent.  

I hope that all car dealers recognize that this is the way to go (some still lack it.  Kudo's to Tommy and Will Smith for the good experience.

319,"May 15, 2015","All I can say is.If you are Looking for a vehicle? Edgar Urias is the man to come and look for. He was very professional in the manner that he treated us. He didn't just greet us and try to sell to us right away, you could tell he was interested in our taste, needs and budget. Edgar spent several hours with us, patiently allowing us to view vehicle after vehicle before we finally made a decision. I have to admit that when we arrived at Norman Frede Chevrolet, I had no intention of purchasing a vehicle. I was simply there to see an SUV that my hubby was very interested in. Although we were in need of a vehicle for both my husband and I, I felt we were not quite ready to make the decision at that moment. But I have to say we arrived there with the only vehicle we had and left from there with not only one but 2 new vehicles. Because of Edgars hard work and, I do mean he really worked hard to help us, we were able to drive out of the Norman Frede Chevrolet Dealership with not only one, But we drove out with 2 vehicles that day. There are no words to describe how very appreciated we are with Edgar and all of his hard work, and the staff, was just super professional and so pleasant to work with as well. Never have we purchased a vehicle with such genuine Professionals ever. Thank You to all of the People that helped us from Norman Frede Chevrolet, from the bottom of our hearts. We will definitely be back to purchase again and recommend to anyone in search of a vehicle to call Edgar @ 281-486-2230. Remember that The Edgar way is the only way!!!! ",5.0
320,"May 12, 2015","I was recently looking to replace my Chevy Equinox for a larger vehicle. Edgar was the first person to greet us at the lot and the last one to speak to us as we left the lot. From the beginning to the final sale of the vehicle, I could tell that Edgar was really interested in helping me and not just selling a car. Every interaction with Edgar was and still is great. Edgar will not just sell you a car but will do whatever it takes to make sure you always have a great experience. This, to me, is all I ask for when looking to purchase a vehicle. Give me a great experience. This is what I received when I purchased my new vehicle. 

They took my trade in and paid off my whole loan on my previous vehicle and got my payments where I needed them. Pastor and Joel, Thank you so much! I was quite firm on my requirements and they did everything to get me what I was looking for. Absolutely the best experience. I would highly recommend that you see Edgar. He will make sure you get the possible experience and you end up walking out satisfied with your purchase. Don't forget to ask for Edgar Urias. He is the person you want to work with when  your in the market for a vehicle.

Since my purchase, I have returned and greeted with the same energy. I returned to get my plates and enjoyed catching up with Edgar. Always happy to see the guy and let him know how grateful I am for the experience. My GMC Acadia is the best vehicle I have owned yet and proud of it! A great family vehicle for sure.

I am an informed, nonsense kind of customer and I know exactly want and what I expect to pay for a vehicle. I travel all the way from Humble to Clearlake to purchase my vehicles, knowing I will not waste my time. Sales representatives like Jose are very rare these days; he understands the level of professionalism and dedication expected to gain the trust of life-long customer.

The dealership has been in this area for 47 years, and their name is on a ton of cars locally!  My husband does not like a ""high pressure"" sales person.  Edgar greeted us and when we described our needs (low mileage, late model, and great price), he showed us a 2012 Equinox with 20K miles!  We loved it and he said it had literally arrived the day before.  It had LOW mileage and looked like a 2015.  I am the lucky one (the wife) to get to drive it!!  Edgar promised financing to meet our needs (under $200/month note).  The finance person was great, and we traded in my car and put money down.  This SUV has so much on it:  navigation system, bluetooth handsfree telephone (OnStar), picture to aid in backing up, etc.  We were truly astounded that we got such a beautiful car.  The total experience was fantastic, including Edgar, the finance man and the manager of the dealership.  Edgar helped start the OnStar, showed us the immaculate engine, and the ample storage space behind the back seats. Side air bags were crucial since we have grandchildren.  We are very thankful to them for going the extra mile, and would recommend Norman Frede for a great deal and excellent customer service.  ",5.0

355,"May 15, 2014","Ha... ya, I just wanted to start off kind of old-school with my title :) So, what can I say, Nathan Cook is pretty awesome. I mean it's pretty obvious once you show up to a 6' 4"" or 5"" giant wearing a smooth suit with the old-school hat and feather. That's really enough said on its own. But it kinda helps that he's a dad, because he has an understanding and reassuring vibe. I mean, you really don't even have to buy a car from him and he'll still help you out and direct you, and inform you (that's a big one). I guess in general he just takes care of you. When i think of car dealer people, I think of an over-bearing alpha male who will single you into a corner and have you half-way through the buying process before you've even made a decision on a car or even truelly given real thought about making such a big purchase. When i think of Nathan Cook, I think of a friend who happens to sell cars. He's a great guy, and im so glad he's not a shark like all the other car dealer guys (or gals). Norman Frede Chevrolet is in all a pretty chill place, ive only dealt with Nathan (so i can only truelly testify to him), but everyone seems pretty cool, plus they keep really good music going all the time. With my life situation, I needed to down-grade quick. Insurance and monthly payments sucked for me. I let Nathan no my situation and he took care of me. I was actually upside down, and he put me in a very nice 2013 Ford Focus, and worked out a beautiful deal that i literally didn't even see coming. I mean I can even give you all the words of how I felt at the time, but I'll leave you with this: Nathan Cook is great, and has since become a family friend, but to me and my fiance, he was and is a true blessing :) ya

We first started working with Nathan Cook from Norman Frede in Houston when we came across a Tahoe that we were very interested in from Auto Trader. Not only was Nathan extremely professional to work with, but he was also super quick to respond, get me answers, and work with us on our trade. I called several other Austin dealerships that were not near as fast to work with, or professional, or that were willing to give us the deal that Nathan was able to work out. We wanted to make sure that if we were making the drive from Austin that the vehicle was as accurately described as possible. He answered all of our silly questions again, with professionalism, couth, and speed! Nathan was great about following up without being annoying or overbearing. Nathan made sure to have all of the paperwork taken care of in advance so that when we did arrive everything was seamless. We were in and out in under an hour and the best part, the vehicle we purchased was even better than described and what we expected. A few days after our purchase, Nathan called to make sure we didn't have any questions and thanked us again. In addition, we received a hand-written thank you letter. It's not very often that people go over and beyond to ensure customer satisfaction, but that's what sets Nathan apart from the rest. Hands down one of the most positive car buying experiences we've ever had. Not only would I recommend Nathan and his team at Norman Frede, but I hope that if we continue to buy in the Chevrolet/GMC family, that we will continue to work with Nathan!

374,"January 29, 2014","Buying a car can be a great big hassle. Is this the car I really want? - is it in good mechanical condition? - am I going to get a great, good, fair or poor car? - can I get a better deal/car somewhere else? - are the sales people going to take me for a bad ride and treat me like a checkbook? Well folks I can tell you I have been buying cars for many years and I have never had such a good experience as I did at Norman Frede.  These folks have it going on and I am sure I don’t need to tell Mr. Frede that because I’m sure his quality factor in sales, referrals and repeat business is telling him all this. I was greeted with a smile and friendly hello and the sales and staff made me feel welcome and comfortable. They work together over there as the person that took me for the test drive in my to-be new Jeep was not my salesman, however he made me feel as I was just as important to him. Mr Pastor asked me several times during the process if I needed anything and was just checking to make sure I was getting the attention I should be getting. Patrick Wood, my salesman, was a sharp intelligent, friendly and attentive. I asked him if he had served in the military because he was so disciplined and respectful. Patrick gets an A+ from me and that reflects back on the other sales staff, the manager Mr. Paster and the dealer.
GREAT JOB NORMAN FREDE!
I’ll be back when I need another car and I will recommend you!

375,"November 08, 2013","Our 2010 Suburban would not start and had no electric power.  A volt meter reading indicated the battery had 12.6 volts and was fine.  “Clint”, at Norman Frede said the charge would be $100 to have the vehicle towed to them, even though the distance was less than 10 miles.  Considering I was attempting to give them my business, I was disappointed that they wanted to make money on the towing.  I just think that shows little compassion and speaks of a greater love for money than man.  After getting the car towed there around 8 AM, I was contacted by Clint a few hours later and told the battery cable was bad and the main fuse had blown, and the cost for this extremely minor repair would be over $400!!  While the battery cable was covered by my extended warrant, the fuse wasn’t, so my out of pocket expense of $260 was basically for a fuse replacement! 

Then very late in the day, I was informed by Clint that we might not be able to pick up our car that day because MasterTech (my warranty provider) had not paid Norman Frede yet.  This lead me to believe that the delay was due to the warranty company being non-responsive, so I called MasterTech and spoke to the same person who had dealt directly with Clint and I was informed that Clint had not even sent over the request for payment until 4:30 PM!  Once it was received, MasterTech sent payment back at exactly 4:32!

I find it a bitter insult that for giving my business to Norman Frede, I was grossly over charged and put at risk of losing the use of my vehicle for another day.  Clearly, Clint did not deal with me in good faith.  Nor did he perform his job with the minimum acceptable level of professional due diligence.   That experience is enough to ensure that Norman Frede will never see my business again.  It’s also enough to ensure that I will share this story with my family, friends, co-workers, and neighbors, not out of spite, but to help prevent others from being taken advantage of as I was.",1.3
376,"August 31, 2013",Marcus was a very good salesman! He works hard to fit the customers needs and try's hard to get them the best deal! I will be referring customers to Norman frede because of Marcus and pastor. We purchased a new Chevrolet silvarado and a corvette in 2 days & we are loving our new vehicles ,5.0
377,"April 30, 2013","Only been to dealership 3 times for service since I bought my truck there. This was their 3rd strike. 

Strike I:
Left my name and number for bad side molding (falling off) on brand new truck right after new employee orientation. Was told they would call me but 3 weeks later nobody ever called me to schedule, so I called them. They said they lost my number. 

Strike II:
Took in for 1st oil change and scheduled far in advance, even told them the part that I needed. Took it in at 7:30am picked up at 6:00pm and the warranty work did not get done, part never ordered. Picked up when it came in and put it on myself.

Strike III:
Took truck in for service yesterday from 7:50am - 5:00pm for regular maintenance and warranty work. Had my truck all day long and only serviced customer pay work ONLY and not warranty work again. Had an alignment and the bow tie on my steering wheel is more crooked now than when I took it in. Really?

They don't care about customer's time, concerns or the VIP sticker on my windshield as they tried to have me pay full price for reduced oil change. They didn't even bother to look or ask. 

Meeting with manager today since he left early yesterday, not expecting much. Dont know what this says to you, but it's obvious to me that they just don't give a crap. ",1.8

We look forward to servicing our vehicle here as well and will return in a few years when our teenager is ready for a vehicle. Overall, it was a very pleasant experience.

382,"February 05, 2012","Great experience with this dealership x2! We purchased a truck to pull a travel trailer we were planning to buy.  However, we really didn't do our homework prior to purchasing the truck.  After viewing numerous trailers, we (wife and I )realized we would be limited to smaller trailers(due to towing capacity).  Unhappy with a small trailer, we decided to trade-in our ""new truck"" for a ""newer"" truck with more towing capacity(Silverado).  

JB and Norman Frede worked with us and gave us a great deal again.  We just purchased a brand new travel trailer.  I can honestly say we are both now happy campers and we look forward to a long association with Norman Frede Chevrolet.",5.0

I would highly recommend this dealer, and I do, to everyone, and the great staff there. Everyone has always been so nice and helpful. They go out of their way to give the best service possible. My salesman, JB, was the best I've ever dealt with. He's honest, upfront, and has been diligent to follow up with me on a regular basis to make sure everything is going fine with my new car and the service I've received. I just can't say enough good things about Norman Frede dealership and the staff.",5.0

386,"January 28, 2012","From beginning to end my experience with Norman Frede was phenomenal! The Sales Rep., John Bowlin was extremely knowledgable about the vehicle of choice (Tahoe) and demonstrated all of the latest features which promote safety. Safety played a major part in my purchasing decision so I was very appreciative of the thorough demonstrations. It was that personal touch which helped influence my decision to purchase with Norman Frede and the awesome service demonstrated there carried through to the Finance Dept. when I finalized my paperwork with Will Smith. He was very honest and straight forward through the whole process. I even try to be in the area when it's time for service (oil changes, tire rotations, etc...) because of the super star service I get from the moment I pull up to the moment I get my vehicle back! Love Norman Frede so much I referred my Mother and my best friend who are also satisfied Norman Frede vehicle owners! Thanks Norman Frede for making my experience so unforgettable...

390,"January 27, 2012","Norman Frede Chevrolet is the best dealership I have ever been to.  All of the staff made the buying experience pleasurable.  My past dealership experiences have been awful making car buying an unpleasant chore.  Not so at this dealership.  And I have to say we had the best salesman ever, JB Bowlin.  JB is very knowledgeable and doesn't try to rush you into a decision on a car. He takes as much time as you need, answering all of your questions, spends hours looking through inventories to find what you want.  He truly wants you to make the best purchase for your family. If you are in the market for a new car, check out this dealership, you will be glad you did.  ",5.0
391,"January 27, 2012","I chose to do business with Norman Frede out of all the Chevy dealerships in Houston for a variety of reasons. They are very convenient to my house and with the excellent reputation of their service department, I wanted to buy from where I would go for service. I contacted several dealerships online and John Bowlin ""JB"" was the most helpful and consistent.  Other places made it obvious that I was just a number and they weren't paying attention to when they had talked to me and about what.
I was offered a better price by another dealership but Norman Frede was willing to beat it. They also found the exact truck I wanted and had it brought to the dealership. The entire process from discussing options to getting my keys was as smooth is I've ever experienced.
This is a family owner operation that has been in business for a long time and they really do make you feel like they care.
I've been very happy with them and will continue to give them my business. I highly recommend them to anyone looking to buy a Chevy.",5.0

393,"December 13, 2011","I have purchased 5 vehicles from Norman Frede in the past 8 years, some new and some used. Every time I purchase a vehicle from Norman Frede it's the same consistant dedication to customer service that I have found to enjoy with my purchases.  I have dealt with Jose Gonzalez in used cars for 8 years and it seems like I am part of his family with the way he takes care of me.  He always ask me about my parents and brother who have also purchased vehicles from him.  Jose always gives me that personal assistance and comfort when making the right choice for a vehicle depending on my needs.  I also take my vehicles to Norman Frede for Oil Changes and any maintanance work needed on my vehicles and the Service Dept is excellent!  They always keep me updated on any recalls for my vehicles or any sort of maintenance repair needed without the pressure of having to do it now.  Overall, I have been very satisfied with the service and customer care in sales needed when repairing or purchasing a vehicle. I have referred Jose Gonzalez many customers in the past and I always have the confidence that their going to get the best deal and the 5 star customer care that I appreciate from Norman Frede.
