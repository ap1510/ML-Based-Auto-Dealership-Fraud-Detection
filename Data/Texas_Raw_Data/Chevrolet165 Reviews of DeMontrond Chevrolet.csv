Matthew Craft came out to greet us on the new vehicle lot, and he helped us with his professional and courteous manner in selecting our new truck.

He was able to help me pinpoint a truck with all the features I wanted while staying within my budget.  Kelly in financial was also very helpful and walked me through all the numbers so I would know exactly what each item was.

6,"October 28, 2019","I was kinda dreading going to purchase a new vehicle mainly because of all the pressure with sales people it doesn't feel like they look out for your best interest but thank God I went to Demontrond in TX City and dealt with Michael Weldon and he set the bar so high that I would not go anywhere else, he's awesome, works hard to make you happy thank you Michael and to Brad.

7,"October 22, 2019","Great Experience. My brother had bought a car from here through Tony a couple years ago, and he was suggested to me. Easiest experience I’ve had, and I never felt pressured. Tony treated me and my family members like family instead of just a random person wanting a car, and I’d suggest him to anyone looking to buy a vehicle. 

Also both Tony and Kelly(in finance) stayed after closing just to help get this process done and it was greatly appreciated. Both were helpful and nothing but kind even though it was so late.

21,"November 27, 2018","Every employee I worked with was courteous and friendly.  At no point did I feel like shark bait on a hook, nor did I feel like a dropped wad of cash.  Mark took the time to explain several items to me a second time when I had questions about something. Financing was a great experience as it could be with all the anxiety of signing what amount to a small mortgage payment.",5.0

But after my experience with Tim I feel more than comfortable to go through it again with ease. My biggest concern was not understanding all the numbers and how things worked but everything was explained in detail. I beyond appreciate his help! So excited to send more people his way! ,4.8
26,"September 12, 2018","After being jerked around by another dealer who said that they couldn't find the car that I'd put a down payment on, I called Demontrand and they had the vehicle in stock! I paid a little more, but the service and knowledge delivered from Tim made the extra money worthwhile. They were able to get me into the vehicle that we wanted the same day that we came in and even worked to keep my 2 yr old occupied through the process. We couldn't be happier.",4.5

31,"July 16, 2018","I very much enjoyed my car buying experience as De Montrond, with the help of Wayne Rowe! I went there the first time with very strict parameters, and he stayed within them, and helped me look art the cars I wanted. I left that day without a vehicle. I came back about a week later, intending only to look at some different vehicles, and ended up leaving with a Honda! (Which was a car I didn't even have on my radar!) He told me about a car he thought I would like, and he was right! I just couldn't walk away. 

He bent over backwards making deals for me and helping me with trading my car in. I am still ecstatic about my new- to- me vehicle, and I am definitely recommending all of my friends there!!",5.0
32,"July 11, 2018","My name is Jonathan Halfin and I went to DeMontrond Chevrolet to buy a work truck on July 3rd. Ron Linton greeted me immediately and I told him I had an idea of what I thought I wanted. As I was test driving vehicles I realized I didn't like the look or feel of anything that I originally thought I wanted. Ron listened to all of my concerns and instead of pushing me into a vehicle that I mistakenly thought I needed, he actually almost read my mind. After patiently working through several hours of my uncertainty he was able to find the perfect truck at the price I could agree on and be happy with. I would highly recommend Ron because he is thoughtful and thorough in his process and will go out of his way to ensure your happiness. Also their warranty is amazing and was a big factor in my decision! ",5.0

Not only did Fred get me an excellent selling price for my new Equinox, but also an excellent trade-in amount for my car.  The rest of the selling process was also hassle free.  Every employee I dealt with was pleasant.  For the first time in my life I drove away from a dealership in my new car, not feeling like ""I had been had.""  I will recommend DeMontrond Chevrolet to anyone looking for a new vehicle.  And will also tell them to as for Fred Sanchez",5.0

43,"November 12, 2017"," Juan Gutierrez has to be the worst sales manager. Long story short he tried to pull a fast one on me and changed our agreement. When the finance paperwork came back and I looked over it my monthly term was not the same as discussed. He then comes back and says that by extending the term was the only way he could get to the price we agreed on. I then told him I would not sign because we agreed on price and term before he ran my credit. 
He then got upset and said there’s nothing he could do for us and ripped the paperwork up in front of my wife and I. We have never been more embarrassed in our lives. I think he was so sneaky and a liar. Worst car experience of my life. ",1.4
44,"November 03, 2017",My experience with Demontrond was great. Shawn was able to get exactly what we were looking for at a good price; our concerns were always taken into consideration.

48,"September 09, 2017","Early this morning I indicated my interest in the Colorado model of mid-size Chevy trucks. Shortly thereafter my phone lit up with no less than 6 eager salespeople from various dealerships within a 75 mile radius. Mr. Jessie Barona, Floor Manager, was one of the first, if not the first, representative I spoke with by phone. 

I explained to him my situation (total loss of my 2016 Colorado W/T due to flood), and informed him of my new interest in a 4-wheel drive Colorado. We agreed to meet a little later in the day.

Upon arriving I began to look over the vehicles outside...Jessie appeared and we took a Z71 for a test drive. I was very impressed with the vehicle, as well as Jessie's knowledge of the various controls and features which were lacking on my W/T model. We made our way into the building to work on a deal. During the short time I had alone while Jessie and Juan Gutierrez crunched the numbers I spied a beautiful black on black specialty ZR2 on the showroom floor and, well, I drove it home.

I have always been impressed with the caliber of sales personnel at Demontrond, Texas City, as I have also purchased a Holiday Rambler motor home there in 2012, and now 2 Colorados. And, the service department cannot be beat for their friendliness and professionalism.

I highly recommend Demontrond, Texas City, and would suggest you ask for Jessie.",5.0
49,"August 13, 2017",I recently purchased a 2016 Chevy Silverado from Demontrand and David was my sales rep. He was very eager to help and was upfront the whole way with all pricing.

51,"August 10, 2017","My wife and I are proud owners of our new Suburban thanks to our awesome salesman Mina. He was able to deliver on what we have been looking for, on over a two week process in a matter of a day. Best of all it was all online. I gave him my specifics on what I was looking for, the amount I was willing to pay and he delivered in 1 day without any haggle on the price. No going back and forth to speak with a manager like most people would go through. 

Thank you Mina and DeMontrond Chevrolet for a great experience. I look forward to my next purchase with you.

56,"July 25, 2017","When my tire pressure monitor indicated 24# of pressure but the tire looked ok I thought it might be a glitch. Next morning it indicated 15# yet still looked fully inflated so I thought it was a bad sensor and took it in to be replaced. Well, there was a nail in the inner edge of the tire which couldn't be safely plugged, so a new tire was in order. 

I was given a print-out with the specifics and price of the replacement by Taylor. I informed her I would shop around a bit, whereupon she informed me the dealership would price-match. Good news!

After finding the same tire, I thought, for less money, I called parts, speaking with Mike, who looked up the information I provided, and did, in fact, match that price.

Turned out that that wasn't the exact tire that matched the others and, after discussion with Mike, he took the time to explain how that happened (my information) and then took the time to compare the new tire with the others and, guess what, it was a better tire for less money.

Thank you Mike and Taylor for all your help.",5.0
57,"July 24, 2017","Demontrond was easy to tell what I wanted and what my budget was. It was easy to talk to them and my sells person, Devon, was not pushy at all. Although being approved for more, he understood what I wanted my monthly payments to be and never showed me something that was out of MY budget range. Very patient with my test driving of different cars and stayed late so I drove home with the car that night! Highly recommend this dealership.

60,"July 12, 2017","Devon was very courteous and patient with us in finding a vehicle. We did not arrive until later in the evening and drove three vehicles. The inventory was very limited for the type of vehicle and price we were searching. For the most part the reason we stayed was for the Lifetime Warranty. I feel like we settled for a vehicle because of the limited inventory, even though my husband did not share the same sentiment.  My husband was pleased with our choice.  ",3.6

Paul Reyes assured us our Equinox would be repaired back to its original condition and as quickly as possible.  Paul was excellent to work with!  It is difficult when you live 5 1/2 hours away, but Paul kept us updated on the progress, even sent us pictures.  He was very patient, always taking our calls and answering any questions we had.

71,"March 02, 2017","I would strongly advise to not buy a car from this lot.  I purchased a used truck from this dealership and within 1 day of owning the car it had to be taken in.  The dealership has now had my car for over a week and have not even started working to repair it.  On top of that, I am now expected to pay for part of the repair even though the issue was reported about 16 hours of driving the car off the lot.  The service department is impossible to communicate with and don't seem to really care that you need your car back. If I could give zero stars I would.  I will never buy another vehicle from here, and I strongly advise you not to either.

75,"January 02, 2017","Generally had a very good experience purchasing a new Corvette.  The only reason I down graded from 5 to 4 stars was because the original sales guy I dealt with demonstrated his youth and inexperience.  He has since left the dealership.  Later, Tony Victoria, was very professional.  I appreciated the considerable amount of time Tony spent with me showing how to operate everything in the car.  It's pretty high tech and much of it was new to me.  I haven't yet used the service dept. so I don't have any comment about them.",4.3

Paul took out the time to visit with me and explain my upside down in a previous  purchase from another dealership. Paul gave me good advise and time to think about what was best for me and my husband. I really appreciate that.

I was able to trade in both of my vehicles and purchase a 2016  Silverado Truck and a 2013 Hyundai Santa Fe Sporty . I had been to most of the other dealership but was met with no help, even the dealership I purchased my previous cars from for over 7 years. 

Demontrond was a different purchasing experience for me and my husband. I will be a repeated customer and I have already began telling my friends and co-workers-DEMONTROND is the dealership to visit before making a purchase.

131,"June 14, 2015","I had a hit and run that caused a dent in my right front fender. It was in a bad place because of all the parts that had to be removed to get to the bottom of the dented under layer.(as was explained to me by the collision estimate representative) I also had another estimate that was higher, So I knew that I was getting a good price for the repairs. It took a few weeks before I was able to drop off my truck and get a ride home. I did not claim it on insurance because of the repair cost being just under $500. I had a 2002 pickup in the garage that I did not trade in. So I did not need a rent car. I called to let them know I was not going to be able to pickup my truck on the day it was supposed to be ready. They told me that it was good, so they did not have to rush the truck into the paint area.(last step) I received a call the next morning about 10am that my truck was ready. I told them that I would call when I got home from work that evening and they said they would have someone to pick me up. I called and there was someone there to pick me up just as they had said.
I picked up my truck and the repair was done great . I could not see any evidence of a dent. I would say this is about the best service I could have asked for. No excuses, paid the price I was given for repairs, even though I was told another part was needed.

I went to this dealership being told I was approved for financing with a trade in & drove off in my new car. About 3 and a half weeks later I was wondering when my paperwork from the finance company would be mailed so I can start making payments. I called DeMontrond & they told me that they were still waiting on the paperwork to be processed which will be completed very soon. Let's not forget about the trade in I gave them which DeMontrond was supposed to payoff the finance company during this time also, less than $900. More time passes buy. Then a month and a half passes by, when I receive a call from DeMontrond saying the deal did not go through & I have to bring the car back. This really blew my mind. I thought what a joke, but all was serious & I had to return the car after being told before that I was approved, signed the bill of sale an all other paperwork too. This means my trade in was never paid off, causing my credit score to go down even more cause the account was seriously deliquent. I have never received bad service like this EVER!!! Beware of this place. After researching, I began to notice that DeMontrond has a history of taking a VERY LONG TIME to process their paperwork. They will lead you to believe everything is fine, then before you know it, you have to bring their car back. They were very rude when telling me I had to bring the car back. Thank god I got my trade in back or else I would not of had a car at all. Please take my advise & DO NOT come to this place. Very bad service, very unprofessional, very rude also!!!
