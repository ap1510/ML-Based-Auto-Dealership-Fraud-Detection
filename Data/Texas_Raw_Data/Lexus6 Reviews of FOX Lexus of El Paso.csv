No matter which service person I get, they are rude and so disrespectful. I was tempted to buy another car from Lexus but decided against it being that this service is so bad, I can only imagine what the sales department is like. ",1.0

Our new Lexus was supposed to be deliver Saturday/Monday, everyone ignored texts/voicemails and received a dissapointing message from Scott(Salesman) blaming service for the mishap.  In addition, payoff check never sent as promised causing additional headaches for me.  Please wear a formal attire when going to Lexus of El Paso everyone will judge and help you depending on looks.  Very dissapointing!

2,"October 10, 2017","I took my Lexus to get service, since we bought the car in Hawaii all the paperwork and warranties had to be transfer to El Paso because they couldnâ€™t pull out the info of the car in their system.  The service consultant fill out paperwork and gave it to one of the managers so they could forward the info to (which I thought it was in Hawaii) to retrieve the info of the car. Last week I called the service department to schedule service, and I asked if the info on the car was received. The service consultant said it was not received yet; keep in mind it has been about 4 to 5 months. I asked for the number to call myself to see what was taking so long. The number I was given by the service consultant was the incorrect number,  it was a number here in Texas. I had to call two other places to get to the correct department. I called the Lexus place in Hawaii and they told me that the paperwork would be transfer in one to two days. If the paperwork was not received, how come no one in the service department contact me and let me know. I have been waiting for this paperwork so I could get my car service and see what was still covered under the warranty.",2.0

5,"March 02, 2017",I have never had so much difficulties as I have had Wood Lexus service I called to bring my car in for inspection sticker and they told me they did not have enough technicians I've taken it in for an oil change only and have waited for over an hour and a half.. I have dealt with Toyota when I had my camera and I have excellent service oil change took place then an hour mr. Martinez what's an excellent service rep who always kept in touch as to the progress of my vehicle.. I would never get another Lexus simply because of the service department which in my opinion is unsatisfactory. Jose Rodriguez 915 603 8242,1.0
