0,"June 23, 2020","Let me tell you, these people are both disrespectful and racist. Paul Farris came out and completely changed what was advertised. We saw a car, came in to buy it ready to pay in cash. They told us to pay cash we have to pay an additional $1000 because they don't get financing fees. Not only did they want us to finance, but they wanted us to finance the ENTIRE cost of the car. After some back and forth we were presented with a number and told to sign a sheet saying we would definitely buy if that was the offer (our sales rep got this price from Paul). Once we signed Paul recanted and said financing the whole thing or don't buy the car and then told our sales rep to go help other customers, effectively dismissing us. Never in my LIFE have I dealt with such terrible service and I would not advise ANYONE to take their business here.",1.0
1,"April 21, 2020","I have been a VW customer for over 10 years. I am new to the area and do not recommend this place. I was over charged and one of the services provided at this location was not completed as stated. I went to another VW dealer closer to my work. They informed me that it does not look like the work was completed due to the condition of my vehicle. I did contact both VW Customer Care and Clay Cooley. Both were unable to help me. I spoke to Ket to address my concern. He did not call me back to follow up. He had another employee speak to me even after I requested a call from him to discuss the issue further. I did not enjoy my experience at the dealership as well. I highly recommend not visiting this location. They are not helpful and fall short from any other dealership service I have visited. They are very friendly, but do not let that fool you. They are not competent. ",1.6
2,"February 08, 2020","I had such a great experience working with everyone at Clay Cooley Park Cities Volkswagen! I contacted them online and Kelly Knight was my knight in shinning armor. She was extremely responsive, listened to my needs, and made me feel like she had my back. She made the process so smooth and easy. I had the flu and she was kind enough to arrange transportation which was the cherry on top. Zach and Jeff were absolutely lovely to work with and I would highly recommend working with their team. Thank you all for being so warm and welcoming to the big D!!! ",5.0
3,"December 28, 2019",i would avoid this dealer at all cost they are not knowledgeable about the servicing of a Volkswagen a brand they are selling or any brand of car.  My vehicle was taken here for a simple oil service and the result of it was that i ended up spending more to fix whatever they screwed up and tried to deny doing after multiple times of them lying about why the issue was occuringi will never recommend or return to this dealer for anything again.,1.0

6,"October 17, 2019","Received by attentive sales associate who was busy with another client. Introduced me to a very dear elderly lady who was a receptionist ,I guess. She went to find a sales associate,returned and said he would be with me shortly. Well approx 15 minutes later a very disinterested sales associate saunters over reeking of cigarette smoke clearly irritated that his smoke break was cut short.He doesn't introduce himself. He could only answer a few of my product questions. When I saw I was getting nowhere as he had to reach in to the glove box to find a data sheet to give me the price of the vehicle on display.
I asked if I could please test drive a Tiguan and an Atlas he said he would arrange it. When another couple entered they were attended to and I was ignored. No feedback as to whether the test vehicles 
 were available or how long it would take after 20 minutes of hanging around without as much as a glimpse from the sales associate and being unable to attract his attention without being rude I decided to inquire as to whether the Dealer Principle or GM was available. When asked why I wanted to speak to this person I said I wanted to lodge a formal complaint regrading bad service. I was then told by this lady who clearly was neither of the two that she handles complaints- coincidentally
The Monday I phoned to inquire who the GM was. Got his name and asked to speak to him. He was not available, I left a message with the call answer-er requesting he please phone me. This did not happen. I phoned later the day and left him a voice message. No response. I phoned again the next day still no response. Clearly they do not need my or any of my friends,family ,colleagues or social media friends  business.  How they are still in business sis beyond me.. I wonder if the response from VW USA will be any better.",1.0

8,"September 23, 2019","Dealership sold a car as new that had damage and chose to hide and not disclose the car was damaged. Check engine light came on as soon as I drove off the lot, manager made an execuse that the light had water in the lights and can be fixed, very common…. He made every attempt to not mention the damage or let me reference it. Made attempts to fix as cheap as possible and damage still exists on the car. Stay away from these guys they are crooked! ",1.0
9,"September 19, 2019","They told me ONE WEEK ago, I needed to pay them $3K for wheels and wheel spindles due to alignment issues I was having   I’m sorry, I am not spending that when the car I BOUGHT FROM THEM is only worth $9K today. They told me it was serious... Then they offered to quote me a buyout price...Then, they spoke to me- the ‘gentleman’ swearing at me, saying “Look, you old man, I’m not gonna offer you anything til ya pay the 3 grand.” Thank God I called my grandson who found a good repair shop and drove it over after Clay Cooley’s ONE WEEK, THREE THOUSAND DOLLAR quote. After 1 hour, Alternative Automotive did an alignment and charged me $100.  The car was perfect. These people are just sick! How they continue to screw people over is just disgusting to this old guy!",1.0
10,"September 13, 2019","Despite being told my ongoing warranty work would be addressed even after my warranty expired just two days prior, this dealership has no authority to get anything done. They’re just an empty suit.

If you need warranty repairs on your car, this dealership will pretend they can’t find the issue until your warranty expires and then never respond to you again. If you request to speak to a manager, they send out an unprofessional mechanic to intimidate you. They won’t return phone calls or emails but can reply to a negative review within the hour. You’ll regret doing business with unethical company. 

And despite what they say in their anonymous reply to your review, they’re not sorry. Actions speak louder than words.",1.0

12,"August 09, 2019","The lease payment that Shannon Wonzer (one of CC's salespeople) offered on a Tiguan ended up being over $200/month (not a typo) higher than three other DFW Volkswagen dealers offered less than 48 hours later for the exact same model. If that isn't a bright red flag, I'm not sure what is. If you know the leasing math, you're wasting your time even picking up the phone to call this dealership... and if you don't know the math, you'll end up getting completely exploited. 
Also, to preemptively reply to CC’s standard response to a growing number of negative reviews – no, you won’t see me again in the future. Your sales staff had the opportunity to be fair and transparent, and they were neither. 
To anyone reading this: Rusty Wallis VW in Garland, McKinney VW, and Metro VW in Irving all have similar vehicle selection and far more reasonable salespeople.",1.0
13,"July 27, 2019",Kathy Parks was exceptional. She went the extra mile to find the perfect car for me. She really worked tirelessly with finance Jason and between the 2 they found the perfect solution and after having a horrible experience in Amarillo it was well worth the drive to Dallas to get the car i wanted at the price and terms that filled my needs. Kathy explained and demonstrated the many bells and wordless the tiguan has. she is extremely knowable if the car and it’s operations. Kathy went into great details on service and maintenance of the car. I would recommend anyone to go and have Kathy and Jason get you in a new car ,5.0
14,"April 30, 2019","After I signed for my new car, the customer service provided by my sales representative was terrible. I had to go out of my way many times to make trips to the dealership just to get paperwork signed, and retrieve necessities for the vehicle. Simply put, my (the customer's) needs were not a priority to my salesman nor the secretaries I spoke with on the phone. 

On a brighter note I had a great experience with the financial representative, Jason at Volkswagen Credit. He knew exactly what my goals were in financing a car and helped me achieve them. Because of him, I got a great deal! Also his customer service was superb! I recommend having Jason as your financial consultant at this Volkswagen dealership. ",2.8
15,"April 04, 2019","Beware! The dealership aren't selling cars, which means they aren't making money so they are scamming customers who bring their cars in for service. David Newbauer serviced my car on March 30, 2019 and didn't get my authorized signature to perform a dianostic nor did he get my written signature to perform multiple items that he claimed the dianostic test showed was defective on my car. I brought my car in because the brake sensor light and brake light were on and he claimed that my rear brakes were metal to metal and deemed ""unsafe to drive."" He told me that brake repair would cost $615 and my car would be ready on Monday April 1, 2019. I gave him the authority to do ONLY brakes, but when I went to pick up my car, my bill went from $615 to $1552.33. He claimed that I told him to repair everything and I clearly did not. Then David quickly informed me that they work with a finance company that will give you a line of credit for repairs. BUYERS BEWARE! David told me that all he needed was my drivers license. I instructed him to use the address on the service ticket because the address on my drivers license wasn't current. David elected not to listen to me AGAIN and entered the application with the wrong information (probably intentionally). He came to me stating that the down payment would be $715 and asked what kind of monthly payments did I want and showed me a number of options. I chose the 12 month option then he disappeared again and came back for my signature on a blank Ipad screen. I never saw the contract, I never saw the amount that would be debited out of my account. When I got home, he had authorized $944.33 to be taken out of my account without my permission. ",1.0

19,"March 19, 2019","Wow, I don't think I've ever dealt with such manipulative, unprofessional and deceptive people as I unfortunately had to at Park Cities Volkswagen. A sales person named Billy contacted me after I reached out regarding pricing posted online. Turns out I don't qualify for the pricing they deceptively posted and they very rudely told me they can't help that I don't qualify for offers in fine print(they weren't even in fine print) after several rude texts from Billy, I asked to speak to the sales manager, Brian or Jason , who told me basically the same thing, since I am not handicapped, military, recent college grad AND a first response I wouldn't get the discounts even though the price was listed online as actual price. He then proceeded to HANG UP on me! A sales manager. How's that for professionalism? I now understand why the staff acts like they do; they're only following the example of management. I'm not sure I know anyone who is handicapped, first responder, military, AND a recent grad. I was ready to purchase a new car from them TODAY and their complete lack of professionalism and business ethics made me realize I want nothing to do with them. Steer clear.",1.0
20,"December 24, 2018","My experience I had with Clay Cooley VW of Park Cities. Their staff is inept or dishonest. I lean towards inept.

""I will give you a call tomorrow and update you"", this is an empty promise coming from the mouths of anyone working at Clay Cooley VW.

Due to character limits I have summarized my email to Stephen Dodge the General Manager. He has not responded:
•	October 24th I visited Clay Cooley VW and asked to see a car listed on Clay Cooley VW website for 27000.
•	The offer sheet appeared with 4000 of accessories. I explained clearly that I did not expect any cost of accessories as the list price had been 27000 and that I would be leaving. The salesman asked me what price I had expected to pay. I answered, ""The 2700 plus Tax, Title, and License"". He asked to write this number down and he would take it to the finance manager. I agreed with him at that time to pay 28500 which included Tax, Title, and License. This can be found on the offer sheet, which I have a copy of.
•	At this stage, there had been no issues.
•	The paperwork dragged on till 10 pm. My wife and I had to leave as the babysitter was not staying any longer. We were asked to return the next day to finish the paperwork.
•	The car was empty on gas.
•	The car did not have the temporary plates on the car as the salesman could not find a screw driver. Rather it was jammed in the window. I had to correct this myself.
•	We returned evening of the 16th. The financing manager began having us sign the paperwork without review. As my wife was signing and I was co-signing, I was entertaining our son. As the paperwork does not clearly state the ""sale price"", she did not catch this error. It is also written as ""total amount financed"" and it is unclear if this did or did not include the 3000 down payment I had already made.
•	My wife did however notice that my name had been written incorrectly and the paperwork had to be re-printed or corrected.
•	After discovering the issue by asking the financing manager, I immediately informed her that this was not what had been promised to me. I asked her what I could do and who could help me. Her only answer ""No one is around this late at night and besides you already have a great price"".
•	Sales manager does not remember even to take the keys of my trade in and I had to return to turn them in.
•	I placed complaints with the customer service representative Mercedes Delgado and the Sales Manager Dwayne Johnson.
•	Dwayne listened about my experience and offered me a 500 dollar refund, but he was unable to refund without higher permission the correct amount which is closer to 1500. He ensures me that he will submit the necessary paperwork and update me the next day.
•	Weeks pass with many unreturned voicemails and failed promises to call me back.
•	Someone from the sales team calls me to ask if I am still interested in purchasing an Atlas. This is the THIRD such call I had received, but I have chosen not to and all of them to reduce clutter in my massive list of disappointments. At this time I learn that both Dwayne and Mercedes have quit or were let go. No one knew about my complaint or planned to follow up.
•	It is now around December 7th and I am forwarded now to Paul Farris, who I AGAIN must explain my complaint to.
•	I decided at this point to visit in person. Introducing myself to Paul Farris, he had naturally forgotten my name and who I even was. I AGAIN reminded him about my issue.
•	Regretfully Stephen Dodge was at the corporate office this day. Paul Farris promises to call me with an update once you return. I was not called.
•	It took 60 days to call me regarding my license plates.
Now 57 days after agreeing to purchase the vehicle, I receive my first actual answer to my complaint... via email, no phone call. It told me that I signed a contract and they will not reimburse me anything.

How do you allow in your institution so many sloppy, incoherent, and lazy behaviors?

Perhaps most importantly, how do we go from Dwayne Johnson offering to refund me 500 dollars to 0 dollars?

Lesson: Double check all of their work in advance!

21,"December 01, 2018","Classic bait and switch.

Here’s the my cautionary tale about dealing with Clay Cooley VW of Park Cities.

Made an inquiry early in the week.  The person I spoke with said it was a “reasonable” offer and someone would follow up with me. Crickets. So I called back the next day and spoke to another person who again said that my offer was “reasonable.” And again, no follow up. Today a new person called me.  I reiterated my offer.  This new person again, using their stock phrase, said my offer was “reasonable.” She said she would take it to her manager and then get back to me.  She called me back 15 minutes later and said they accepted my offer.

Even though the process had been a little sloppy, at this point I had no reason to believe they were dishonest.  But the first red flag was when I asked the sales person to text or email me the details and she didn’t.  No worries, I left work early to go to the dealer to complete the transaction. When I arrived, second red flag was when I saw the car that I had agreed to buy sitting in the showroom and not prepped at all.  So at this point I’m greeted by another new guy because the person I spoke to on the phone had left and the person she told me to ask for when I arrived was supposedly busy.  Spoke to the new guy and I gave him the details, which I’m not sure why they didn’t have already.  After some back and forth, the manager come out and says there must have been some sort of miscommunication because although I had been only discussing one particular vehicle the entire time with a higher level trim, the sales person was actually offering the base trim.  The funny thing about this explanation was that if this was true then my offer would have been significantly higher than MSRP. But whatever, they had wasted way too much of my time.

You would think they would have learned something from the VW emissions cheating scandal.  But then again, maybe they did. Maybe they learned how to cheat their customers.

Learn from me, try another dealer that actually respects their customers to deal with them honestly. 

I guess I know now why everyone says: “He’s the worst. He’s an xxx. Either way, stay away from Clay.”",1.0
22,"February 23, 2018","I found the 2012 Hyundai Sonata Blue online and spoke with Clint Hickman about the vehicle. Clint was very helpful, honest, and a pleasure to work with. I went out for a test drive and liked the car. It was clean and in very good shape. Took the car to my mechanic and it check out with flying colors with an hour-long inspection. I worked with Clint, the Sales Manager Paul, and Finance Manager Jeff. I found everyone to be extremely professional and never once felt any hard sell.

I drive to Clay Cooley and am told by Nick (Service Manager) the battery had a two year warranty, it is now pro rated, I do have to pay for instillation,I'm better off buying a new battery. They speak with the customer service representative (Pete) that lied to me, they admit he gave me wrong information, but they do not want my business and offer me nothing. I am told their batteries usually die in 3 years. My car has 33,000 miles on it. This is the 3rd batter in 5 years. I am not impressed by Clay Cooley's level of service.

26,"October 07, 2017","BEWARE OF Clay Cooley VW SERVICE DEPT
Another reputable auto repair shop completed a thorough diagnostic test on my car and informed me that the problem was related to an ABS module. They contacted VW and learned that there is an open recall on this module and suggested that I take my car to VW. I scheduled an appt. w/Clay Cooley VW the following day. In a nutshell, Peter the service rep operated with zero integrity and attempted to defraud me. I believe that Peter did this to justify the car not being ready and to buy more time. I immediately escalated to the service manager - John. Instead of John remaining neutral to fully understand ""the customer"" concern, he was defensive, deflected from Peter's detestable actions, and stated VW requires my authorization to proceed with the thorough diagnostic test that takes a couple of hours and cost $140 before they can perform the recall repair. When I called back 20 minutes later to tell them I'm picking up the car, Peter arrogantly informed me that I can pick up the car but they already performed the diagnostic test, something else is wrong with the car and the cost is over $3,000. They will charge me $140 diagnostic fee because they already performed the test. 

Note that after John's (service mgr) response, I reached out to another VW dealership to perform the recall repair. I called the other dealership back and informed them of Peter's last statements. Because  of the other VW  dealership intervention directly with Clay Cooley, when I picked up my car a hour later, John stated that it was ""not possible"" to perform the diagnostic test so they will not charge me $140. 

This is my first negative experience with any VW service dept. since I purchased my vehicle in 2010. I love my car and because of past excellent customer service with this dealership and nearby VWs, I purchased my teenager a used Jetta a few months ago. We will continue to be VW fans but will never return to Clay Cooley because of Peter and John's morally reprehensible conduct. I do appreciate the other VW dealership service dept. getting involved and will go to that dealership for future service and ",1.0
27,"August 28, 2017","On Saturday, I brought my VW Eos w/less than 50K miles in for basic maintenance and got a call that they found several major repairs needed totally $3600. After my shock and horror, I was told it would be ready on Monday. I called Monday around 4:00 to see if it was ready. I was told it was still being worked on but it would be ready later. I asked for a time and was put on hold. A couple minutes later, the service rep said actually they didn't even have the parts for it and it would be Tuesday. So not only does my car w/less than 50K miles need major repairs (in addition to a $1500 water pump replacement earlier in the year), but I'm told my car would be ready until I pushed for a time and the service rep has no clue the actual status of my car and didn't think to call to keep me updated.

The moment you walk in the door to AutoNation Volkswagen Dallas, you will be greeted with smiling faces who are willing to help any way that you ask. Each person I have spoken to is well educated on Volkswagen cars and has a desire to make your experience at their dealership an easy one.

Since day 1 of buying my vehicle (2013 VW Golf R), I have received excellent customer service from both sales and service department. I bought my VW from Joshua, a laid back fellow who didn't push me into buying a vehicle I was not comfortable purchasing. I bough my first manual transmission, an engine I have desired to drive since high school. Ten years later, my dream of buying a 6-speed transmission is finally happening. Leaving me anxious, nervous, and afraid to drive my car off the lot, Joshua spent patient time teaching, demonstrating, and educating me on the fundamentals of my vehicle. After receiving deliberate attention to driving cautiously through neighborhoods around Lemmon Avenue, Josh delivers the car to my apartment so that I can practice driving with ease in the apartment complex parking lot. Three weeks later, I am incredibly happy with my purchase. I am entirely grateful to have been given this type of treatment at AutoNation Dallas. I couldn't have asked for a better buying experience. Thank you Josh!

As time goes by, my car is needed to be serviced for oil changes, cleaning, and tire rotations. Here I meet a Blake, a kind gentlemen with an apt for helping any customer who walks in the door. After my car was serviced, Blake gave me back my car in an orderly fashion, cleaned, and in better condition than when I left it on his door step. The service department here is kind, friendly, efficient, and very helpful and I couldn't have asked for a better service experience. I will forever and always bring my car back to this location. Thank you Blake for all that you do!

39,"May 25, 2015","Warning: AutoNation Park Cities wrecked my car while doing scheduled maintenance. Then they lied to me about what had happened to the car, told me over phone it was just a scratch. They took my new car off the premises, without letting me know and had an accident with it. They blamed a contractor that I didn't even know existed; concealed the identity of the person who wrecked my car and the location. Didn’t apologize and told me my car was drivable to go back home and come back Monday when it was more convenient for them to get me a rental. After I got the car back it had numerous problems, it took over 2 months to correct and I missed work over this.

Blake Harris has been, hands down, the best service associate I have ever worked with at an automotive service center.  He helped me select tires that were within my budget, answered numerous questions, and took the time to discuss options at my level.  Additionally, his customer service skills are excellent--he cared enough to follow-up throughout the process, apologized multiple times for the lengthy wait on my third visit (it was a Saturday afternoon), and even made a couple of suggestions about how to improve the look of my vehicle to match the vanity plate I currently have.

Ken is the best car salesman I have ever encountered.  I hate the term ""car salesman"", but he really is the best.   The first day I went to the dealership, I told him outright I wasn't ready to buy yet for reasons related to my job situation possibly changing.  He understood completely, took my ""wish list"" down for the car I would possibly lease, and never bombarded me with cold calling - actually, it was the opposite.  Once my job situation became secure, it was me calling him!  

Ken has a personality that puts you completely at ease, and a great sense of humor to go along with it.  For financial reasons, I have decided to lease instead of finance, and I look forward to further developing my relationship with Ken and with Autonation Park Cities Volkswagen.  Folks, if you are considering visiting this dealership to buy or lease a Volkswagen (and you should, it is fantastic!), I highly recommend you ask for Ken.

This is a very classy, professional, and organized dealership, the staff are wonderful to work with.  Despite the fact that the previous client delayed our visit with Ivan for such an extended period of time everyone was very gracious to stay well past closing to complete our purchase. Ivan made a point to stop in Sayed's office to assure us that as soon as he finished with his current client he would be right with us.  Once we were able to get in and see him, he was quick, efficient, thorough, and professional throughout the entire financing process.  When we left at around 10:00 pm several of the staff remained to finish up for the day and close up shop.  Despite the late hour everyone remained cheerful and accommodating.  It was certainly not our intent to keep the staff so late after closing. I feel certain that without the previous client delay we would have been done much sooner.

They substituted another car, which I accepted with additional equipment added to the car, and they apologized.  I thought everything would be OK. 

But every time I brought my car to this dealership for the ""no-cost"" service provided with the original purchase, they found something in excess of $100 to try to charge me for.  The first time, it was an ""essential"" ""rear wheel alignment"".  The next time, when I brought the car in for tire service, they insisted that I had to have a new tire at a cost of $280.  I refused and Four-Day Tire fixed the problem for me at no cost.  Then they tried to sell me additional services at the 20,000 mile visit.  I refused.  They got even by not rotating my tires (even though they charged the service to the factory maintenance plan).  Three times, I requested that tires be aired up to my specified psi.  They never could accomplish that task.  The last time, they said that my rear wheels were ""bent"" and would have to be replaced at a cost of over $800.  I refused.  That service, which was only supposed to be only a state inspection, took them over four hours.  They promised me that my car was on the way to the wash and would be ready right away.

127,"March 11, 2013","We've been coming to this dealership for service on our 2002 Jetta since 2005. My experience has always been customer centered. Over the years, we've found the service advisors helpful above and beyond. In some cases, the advisor was able to fix a minor problem (replacing a bulb or resetting a radio fuse) without making out a service ticket or charging. When major repairs were needed, the service advisors worked with the extended warranty as far as possible. Now that we are out of warranty, we're directly impacted by the price of service.
  We had a recent episode, in which a check engine light required replacing our thermostat. Initially, I thought the price was high. I'd called another VW dealer to compare and felt that we'd been charged for 2-3 hours labor beyond what the job called for. When i fussed, the service manager, Bob Stickles, got involved. He carefully reviewed our service records and found that the temperature sending unit had also been replaced. While the TSU was on the invoice, this detail had not been initially discussed. We'd had the temp sending unit replaced 23 months earlier at the dealership, without replacing the thermostat (warranty would only fix what was broken). The price for doing both the thermostat & the TSU together was appropriate; however, Bob offered a $300 store credit!  This was more than fair and kept me as a grateful customer. I am still not sure that the TSU was broken, but with the generous store credit, that issue was moot.
   Dealer service is generally about 20% higher than generic national franchises; however, price is only one component of value. Their knowing the car, recalls,etc. have over the years proven invaluable. A few years ago, the dealer replaced the catalytic converter, a $1300 service free of charge. The dealer knew that VW had some early failures and had extended their factory warranty on the catalytic converter. I am not sure that a muffler shop would have known  that. 
   Our 120,000 mile, 11 year old car this year wound up  costing more to maintain than its $3750 book value. Nevertheless, having Park Cities' crew looking after it will keep it running like new. While our new location is 40 miles away, I still value having much of our routine service performed, simply because their thorough check of the cars systems makes us aware of upcoming repairs if needed.
   Over the years, we've had a few major repairs done elsewhere with mixed reviews. There has never been an issue of quality for nearly a decade at Park Cities.",4.8

178,"January 14, 2013","I have been to this dealership numerous times over the years to get work done on my 2005 Jetta and will never return again. The following is a brief summary of my experiences at Park Cities VW.

 - When the car was purchased, the driver's side door had a small dent so they replaced the door (new car). Within two years, the door was beginning to drop over an inch and not match up with the latch anymore. Turns out they wrong size bolt had been used when putting the door on. This took 3 TRIPS to the dealership before it was fixed and my car was given back to me each time as if nothing was wrong.

 - I picked the car up once and when bringing it out, the service rep put a scratch down the entire length of the car. Dealer fixed the problem.

 - I had a bit of buff work done and the service department gashed the paint near my driver's side mirror. Again, the car was given back to me as if nothing was wrong and I had to point out the problem.

 - It took three trips to convince the service rep that my brakes were catching, as he didn't believe me the first two times and told me ""That's just some rust wearing off - it happens."" My breaks were ruined and had to be replaced. Two years later they told me that my brake shoes were destroyed and there was dust in the brake lines, which he had never seen before. Nobody but the dealership has touched my brakes.

 - Recently, I took the car in because the electronics in my driver's door no longer worked. They gave the car back to my with the interior door handle hanging out of the door. Again, I had to say something to bring the problem to anyone's attention. The service department actually drove the car to me and got out as if the door handle was completely normal.

The lack of discussion between the service department and the customer service reps is disturbing. Everyone I've dealt with has been pleasant enough, but they never know about the problems until I point them out - as if nobody ever looks at the car before the customer picks it up.

I don't trust this dealership, the service department is incompetent, and I will never set foot in this dealership again.

For the record, my family bought three cars here and love Volkswagen, but Park Cities (and all Boardwalk dealerships) have lost our business forever.",2.2

Even after I purchased my new car he called to make sure everything was going well, which I truly appreciated.

191,"January 01, 2013","My wife and I had both been planning to upgrade our vehicles and she purchased a Tiguan earlier in the day at another dealership. They were helpful, but the process had taken a long time and the finance people were a bit pushy. I had been looking for a black VW GTI for awhile on the internet and had even stopped in at another dealership to look at one, but they did not seem very willing to work with me on things I was interested in. We pulled into Park Cities on a whim when I saw the car I wanted in the parking lot while we were driving by. 
Joe Luna came out to meet us and was very friendly. We drove the car and he was helpful, but not pushy. After driving, we discussed options on purchasing, costs, trade value, etc... He was very open and honest, there was no hassle, just straightforward conversation. RJ Kutz helped Joe and I work a deal out so that I could get what I needed for my trade and purchase the GTI with the amounts I wanted. There was never stress involved and we arrived at a compromise that worked for us all. Matt Hewison helped us in finance and explained the options we had on warranties, loans, etc... but also was not pushy like the other dealership we experienced. 
The whole process from showing up to the dealership to driving away was very positive and also much faster than our experience at another location earlier in the day.

If more service reps were as thoughtful and looked out for the customer (as Tony does), more money would be made in the long term via repeat customers.

We spent some time deciding what size vehicle we needed, but were quite focused in that it would be another Volkswagen.  Given our positive experience in selecting the Jetta, we returned to Myron Marcyniak at Park Cities Volkswagen.  We test drove several cars on Friday, and returned Saturday morning to finalize everything.  To give you some idea as to how seamless a process it was, my husband and I were able to make a final selection (2013 Golf TDI--love it), complete the paperwork, and drive home with the vehicle just hours before we were holding our daughter's 10th birthday party.  Normally I wouldn't want to stress myself out before having 12 ten year olds at my house for a sleepover, but I trusted the transaction at Park Cities VW was going to be as smooth as our first.

307,"August 31, 2012","Last March I purchased a brand-new 2012 Passat from Park Cities Volkswagen, and the question became what to do with my 2003 Passat.  My goddaughter was turning 15 years old in July, and I decided to give it to her for her birthday.  She would be getting a learner's permit and her mother planned to apply for a hardship license for her as soon as the law allowed; the father had recently passed away.  My goddaughter is one in a million.  She has never been in a day's worth of trouble, she is respectful, responsible, intelligent, hardworking, and makes top grades at Ursuline.  In my opinion, she had earned that car.  So, I took the car to my trusted service representative, Mike Hart.  Together, we planned the necessary and optional repairs to make that gray Passat with the gray leather interior the most safe, dependable, and beautiful first car that a teenager could ever want.  Mike was absolutely remarkable.  He was patient and knowledgeable and answered all my questions.  He helped me out where he could with the cost of the repairs, and made sure that all the work was done correctly.  He was thorough, and in my opinion, extremely ethical.  His recommendations were to the point on what the car needed.  He kept me updated on the repairs, and let me know when the mechanics discovered some theretofore unknown issues.  He explained each of these issues, gave me a price, and allowed me to decide whether to make each of the repairs.  Of course I did!  This car was for my Precious!  Her life depends on this car!  Mike made sure the Passat was waxed, polished, and detailed when I picked it up.  It even smelled new.  I surprised that teenager with that beautiful car; she screamed to wake the neighborhood, ran over to it, touched it, fell in love with it.  Mike made that happen.  He cared enough about a girl's first car to give it Park Cities' best.  He even worked with me on timing the surprise.  He even called several days later to see how she liked it and make sure everything was done to my satisfaction.  I made sure my goddaughter and her mother knew how well Mike had taken care of the car, gave them Mike's direct line at Park Cities, and know that they will be Mike's newest customers.  I would unhesitatingly recommend Mike to any and all of my friends.  He is a credit to Park Cities Volkswagen.",5.0

How right that has been!  Myron always is in a good mood, he sent regular emails updating me on the Passat I ordered, and he was glad to see me if I dropped in to get a personal update. I ordered my sky-blue Passat TDI SEL in October.  I waited impatiently until it was delivered on March 1, 2012.  It has been everything Myron said it would be and more.  I love that car so much; I have done nothing but drive it since I picked it up, and, today being August 29, 2012, I have put over 13,000 miles on it.  I get about 550 miles per tank, which is fantastic. I rave about it to everyone who will listen.

I appreciate that Myron narrows down the many options because of his excellent knowledge of the product and inventory and presents selections that a buyer would think he's spent weeks preparing.  I'm pretty sure Matt is now setting records for contract signing which I believe the majority of customers consider the worst part of buying a car - it was a very pleasant, easy and efficient experience.

In addition, about 5 months ago, an air bag indicator light went off.  When we took our car to this same dealer they informed us the sensor was bad and needed replacement.

The dealer continued to call my husband for months asking us to replace the sensor.  With the new battery, the air bag indicator light is no longer on.  Luckily we held off and we are not out an additional $1,000 for no reason.",3.6

Its actually a funny story, last friday I was up at my husbands work doing little stuff and father in law, Larry Byrd, dropped by to see us. He was headed to the dealership of of I20/Wheatland for a Sonata. I offered to go with him, I could tell if they were full of it and advise my opinion.The sales guy I wasn't impressed with, I told my father in Law I was making a phone call. I immediatley called Matt, gave him some numbers, summarized the situation to fit my in-laws needs. Before even talking to my Father in law, I told Matt lets get them into a Passat.(not knowing if that model was ok, but Sonata vs. Passat) I was getting him into that Passat! The sales people over at Hynduai were actually building him a invoice, I told him okay lets go and he and I walked out and went directly to Park Cities VW and got Matt in on it. Well in the end my father in law got a 2012 Passat and since my husband met me up there, Matt made my Jetta happen for me all in one day, when we were looking for my father in law and ended up landing a new jetta myself 2012 and was comfortable giving Matt two cars of busines plus the VW CC as well. It was a crazy day, but after following my husband in his CC, father in law in his Passat, all the way East Texas, I finally, at 10p at night on the way back to arlington go back by the dealership and get my brand new and amazing 2012 VW Jetta! One Heck of a day!! Thanks Matt!",5.0

Also, it was hard for the dealership to find the car I eventually decided on, because I wanted a manual GTI, and they didn't have one on the lot at the time (they are sometimes hard to get).  B.J. Knous and Olivier worked to find one, and Olivier stayed in touch with me all day to let me know how they were doing.  When he did find the right car, he called and arranged for me to come get it at my convenience.  He's efficient, totally professional, personable, and he has a great sense of humor.  He had me laughing all day.  Olivier and B.J. gave me a very fair price.  And when I got to the dealership, the process was extremely fast, and Evan Doan explained all the paper work clearly.

He was extremely kind and humorous, making jokes and telling me personal stories of his own life, which made the experience far less tedious. To say that he went above and beyond doesn't even cover it.

He followed up in a timely manner from our first initial meeting.  He was very accommodating  and available for additional test drives.  At time of delivery, he made sure the car was ready for delivery as promised.  He was very through with the instructions and orientation of the vehicle.  I would definitely recommend Steve to all my friends and family to visit with Steve for their next vehicle purchase.

Steve introduced Pete Hodges.  Pete made it clear, that he was there to help Steve in making my experience a pleasant one, and to assist in making the deal.  Pete exceeded my expectations as a Sales Mgr., in all my other vehicle purchases, not one of the Sales Managers ever went out of their way like Pete.  

This had to be one of the best experiences purchasing a new vehicle.  

I will be back to Park Cities VW, for my next VW.

394,"June 19, 2012","My car broke down while I was on business in Dallas, the night before I was supposed to be going home and luckily I made it to Park Cities VW about 20 minutes before closing time.  Chad and the technicians that worked on my car couldn't have been nicer and more helpful, turning what could have been a really stressful experience into a mild inconvenience.  They must have taken pity on me because despite having a busy schedule they looked at my car first thing the next morning and had it back on the road that afternoon, just in time to get me back to Austin.  They kept me informed about what was going on the entire time and were upfront about the cost, which was a little pricey as expected from a dealership, but you pay for what you get and that is certainly true here.  As an added bonus they changed my bad brake light at no charge and washed my car.  I'm actually pretty sure they even waxed it.  I really wish this dealership was in Austin because the customer service was better than what I'm used to at Charles Maund.  I'm (hopefully) never going to have any reason to go there again but for anyone that lives close to Dallas I highly recommend this dealership and Chad in particular if you're able to catch him.",4.6

We spoke less than an hour later and worked out all the details - we negotiated the trade in value of my previous vehicle and price over the phone and came to an agreement that I was very happy with. We scheduled a time to come in and test drive the car for later that evening when both my husband and I could be there. When we arrived, the car was out front and ready to go. We test drove the vehicle, explored the features, and looked over the interior/exterior for any damage. The car was exactly what was represented online and through my conversations with Joe. We decided to purchase the car. This process was short and quick as we had ironed out all of the details prior to coming in.

I told Joe we had a wedding to go to that evening but we would come in in about 30 minutes to see the car and give him a down payment to hold it till Monday when we could come back to finish the deal. When we arrived at the dealer Joe had the car running (it was 97 degrees that day) and we went for a quick drive. My wife and I decided that it was what we wanted and Joe said that we could complete the deal in less than 30 minutes saving us a trip up again on Monday so in less than 45 minutes total we drove out with the new car.

It is my opinion that my vehicle experienced a first class VW service 80 k maintenance effort with a few extra items that I requested.

Mike Hart went way beyond the expected to take care of even my most trivial request and was very detailed oriented. He checked with me and discussed the status of the work whenever it was required including calling me on my cell and emailing me with updates.
   I definitely recommend this service group. Pricing of the work was not low, but 
if an owner wants first class certified service from trained VW mechanics, I'm pretty sure this is the place to bring your car in the Dallas area.
   I did not inspect the certifications of their mechanics, their training program for their mechanics, nor am I aware of what their post work quality control checks are
in the garage. However, the overall impression is one of cleanliness, orderliness and professionalism in the front area of the service group. Such an impression, in my experience, along with the service representative's attentiveness, extends into the service bay area.

476,"April 02, 2012","My sales experience at Park Cities was by far the best car buying experience I have had to date--thanks largely to sales rep Olivier Zitoun.  There is no question that I will go back for my next car (though I expect it will be a while, as much as I love the new CC I purchased!)  I actually accompanied a friend for a test drive, and Olivier dropped everything to assist her (without an appointment).  During the test driving experience, I became very comfortable with Olivier and trusted that he really had my friend's best interests at heart in helping her choose the right car.  I had considered buying a new car for some time, and my positive experience watching Olivier work with my friend helped me to decide that this was the time.  Once I decided on the car (which was pretty simple once I drove the CC), Olivier, Pete, and the rest of the Park Cities team walked me through the process seamlessly. I was happy with the price and the whole experience was very pleasant and educational. Both my friend and I walked out that afternoon with new cars.  I could not be happier with my new car, and I will refer everyone I know to Olivier when they are in the market for a new car.  His focus on getting customers into the ""right car"" at the ""right time"" (for them) shines through and is very reassuring for a buyer who is considering making a significant investment (and who is a bit skittish about the car buying experience).

It was exactly what I was looking for.  After several days of communication and working around our schedules, my husband and I were able to head down during our lunch time.  Olivier was ready as soon as we pulled in.  One test drive and we were sold.  We were able to get exactly what we wanted for our trade in, and the interest rate we wanted as well.  Everything went so smoothly and we were able to be done very quickly so that we could head back to work.  I loved how everyone seemed to work together and there was no running around to ""talk to my manager"".  I am in love with my Routan and cannot be more thrilled at the ease of this process.

488,"March 22, 2012","Olivier is a very good salesman to deal with at Boardwalk.  Everyone was really nice. This is the second time I've bought a car from Boardwalk.  It's the main reason why I am a repeat customer.  My entire experience this time was great.  I had one little concern and they quickly fixed the issue immediately. They gave me a good price for my trade in.


Customer care is a VERY important thing with them. I have another experience from January of this year that definitely made me a repeat customer. I had an 2006 Volkswagen Jetta TDI that needed a brake job and the 50k maintenance package performed. The gentleman that was assigned to me went above and beyond what was required of him.  He was able to get me a loaner car for the day. He could have easily had me rent a car to save himself some time. He didn't, he went out of his way to find a loaner car for me.



Having said that I will say this about the finance guy in the RICHARDSON Boardwalk Volkswagen dealership. Everyone else, especially the salesman, was very nice and professional. This is from my car purchase in June 2009. He is still working there to this day. (How I have NO idea. My opinion, he should be fired IMMEDIATELY)  I bought an used 2006 Volkswagen Jetta TDI. Due to who my employer was he said that my interest rate would be 13%. Only because of my EMPLOYER, not my credit score (above 650).  I called him on this as bull. I got the interest rate dropped to 7.99% 

How can someone have a clear conscious about doing that to a customer? There are a lot of people who he has obviously taken advantage of over the years. I will tell this story every chance I have about him SPECIFICALLY until he is no longer working for Boardwalk. Everyone else I have dealt with at Boardwalk, at both locations, have been great. I do need to add that the finance GENTLEMAN at the Park Cities location was very nice and professional to deal with. It's only the finance guy at the RICHARDSON Boardwalk Volkswagen I am saying this about.

I purchased the Jetta at Park Cities and was so happy that it was a no brainer to go back. I called on Monday morning and spoke with Oliver. I explained that I wanted a Tiguan and if he could make it work for me then I would come in on my lunch break and trade my vehicle in. Well, Oliver did it. He called me every step of the way and finally called and said these are the terms we can do if you give me an hour I will have everything ready. I showed up and was greeted by him and he was very sweet. He had the car out front for me to drive. He walked me through the vehicle and then we were on the tollway. Fell in love with the Tiguan and so we went back. I was in and out of the dealership within an hour. I can not remember my finance manager I worked with's name but he remembered me from before. It had been 3 years and he is still at the same dealership. I am on my 3rd volkswagen and this is my second purchase from Park Cities. I have sent a few friends over and they have the same experiance that I do each time. Even my service rep is amazing. I have had him for at least a year.

517,"February 21, 2012","Came in for a used car, left with a new car with ZERO Hassle! I got a great price for both the car I bought and the car I traded in, although I had no plans to trade in they offered a great trade in value and made it all too easy to do anything different. 

A side note: I never buy brand new cars I find the financial loss of driving a new car off the lot to be too much for my wallet. None the less they gave me a deal I couldn't refuse. 

Our sales Person Israel Velasquez was VERY laid back and very easy going. I didn't experience any high pressure sales tactics, although he was able to get us to drive a new car when we had been looking for a used car. I went along with it as it was the model and transmission type I was looking to test drive and buy used.

After driving the brand new Jetta, I said I liked the car. He suggested we let him get us a price on the new car and see if he could make us a deal. I was surprised to find that he was able to closely match the price of a used Jetta I had test driven at a competing Toyota dealership on a brand spankin new one. Then he got us a good value on the trade in we had no plans to trade in. Plus we got to pick all the options, colors, etc that we wanted. Turns out they didn't have the color option combination we wanted in stock but had one brought in from another store 2 days later. When we picked up the car we found a few added features they threw in that I wasn't expecting! I couldn't have been more pleased. 

Israel also explained all the features and probably did quite a bit of his sales pitch post sale since we didn't give him much of a chance during the sales process. By the time we left  the stereo was paired with my phone and every question was answered. 

I wouldn't expect every purchase made there to go as smoothly and as well. But even if it didn't I'm sure it would be a good experience.

522,"February 16, 2012","I visited Park Cities / Boardwalk VW to look at a Certified Pre-Owned GTI. The sales representative I dealt with was Olivier Zitoun. He was very friendly and helpful as I checked out the car, and then he left me alone to decide for myself whether I was interested in the purchase (the absence of high-pressure sales tactics is a sure way to make me return). I eventually decided to enter into negotiations, and both Olivier and BJ (manager) were respectful, reasonable, and helpful throughout the process. Since taking delivery of the car, I've had a couple of dealings with them, and they continue to make me feel comfortable about my purchase. I buy a lot of cars. Of 10 or 12 vehicle purchases I've made from dealerships, I can honestly say that only two of them were pleasant experiences...this being one of them. ",5.0

I had to write and post this because the degree of service I encountered at Park Cities VW was really impressive. I could tell that they're really making an effort to be customer service focused - it shows! 

Everyone was very friendly and very helpful, but beyond that they really seemed to have my best interests in mind rather than just their bottom line. I've been to dealers for repairs before and always dreaded it because I anticipated having them once again tell me every last little thing they found that they said needed to be repaired urgently whether it really did or not. Well at Boardwalk they weren't that way at all. In fact they looked to be trying to save me money. They looked for efficient solutions to my auto breakdown and were able to fix just what really needed it. That is SO appreciated. 

They did a fantastic job, were great at communications, and my car even came back freshly washed. It was a great experience.
Thanks very much!

Other than that, Park Cities Volkswagen is the best dealership we have dealt with. We started with Metro VW in Irving, but knew we found our Eos's home on our first visit. Unfortunately our first Eos was totalled out when an absent minded driver ran a light and we hit him broadside at 35 to 40 MPH. My wife and I were lucky that all airbags and restraint systems worked perfectly. We were so impressed, we went back and got our 2012 Eos. What a car, what a dealership.

After about 10-15 minutes of negotiation, his manager showed up and mocked me for no reason. He asked questions like ""did I offered too much for your vehicle?"" Or ""Am I offering you too much cash?"" I really didn't like his sarcasm. He asked me same questions more than 5 times. I waited him to stop but I don't think he knows when to stop. He was repeating same thing in a sarcastic way over and over until I walked out of their building. I have never dealt with an unprofessional jerk like him. I would never treat my customers like this.

569,"January 07, 2012","Good Morning Folks!!

Just a heads up..........Mission Accomplished!!

I think as much as its been a proven chore to accomplish stress free air travel these days, and its always been equally difficult to complete the process of purchasing a new or pre owned vehicle. A vehicle that would most of all provide a safe and reliable source of transportation for our family members without additional or unwanted cost.

I think we all understand the importance of good customer service and how that remains to be the key to a successful business. Be it a proven fact that air travel is the source of much unwanted stress and cost while for me looking for the perfect vehicle for one of my family members is equally unpleasant.

While operating under extreme and often unpredictable environments. The most popular question that remains is how do we limit this stress for our customers? How do make the experience pleasurable and a memorable? And one and most important....... How do we keep them loyal?

Answer: You treat your customers the way I was treated during my pre owned car buying experience from the fine folks at Boardwalk Volkswagen and especially a gentleman that I could tell has much experience in the business Mr. Myron Marcyniak. You also team up with a power buying financial group that truly does have you and your families experience as their greatest interest. I will always refer potential customers to both American Airlines Federal Credit Union and to Myron Marcyniak at Boardwalk Auto Group.

I hope that everyone that chooses to fly American Airlines is more than satisfied with their choice in air travel as I am more than satisfied with my decision to choose Boardwalk Volkswagen for my car buying experience.

578,"January 03, 2012","I just purchased two vehicles from Park Cities Volkswagen, one for my mother and one for myself. We did a significant amount of research among the manufactures. Once we narrowed it down to a manufacture, we visited multiple dealers within the Volkswagen brand in our area. We did a substantial amount of research on the internet as well. Most of the dealers didn't have the exact vehicles we wanted.

Of all the dealerships we visited, Park Cities Volkswagen had the best customer service in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex.

Our Sales Representative, Olivier Zitoun, exceeded expectations. He was there when we needed information and had questions, he left us alone when we needed to discuss things in private. We felt secure and comfortable in the negotiations process. He worked diligently with his sales managers to locate the vehicles we wanted and helped us negotiate the best car we could get while maintaining the price point we wanted.

We ended up financing the vehicles with Parkcities Volkswagen. Their rates were substantially better when juxtaposed with various banks and credit union rates we secured before we started shopping.

Matt Hewison, the Finance Manager, made the financing process transparent, simple and easy to understand.

We purchased an extended warranty and maintenance package. I did not feel like we ""got sold"" on the deal. The package was worth the extra money. Considering the interest rates we were getting, we were able to spread out routine maintenance over life of the loan, reducing future, unexpected, out-of-pocket expenses.

While searching through countless numbers of cars online and even visiting different dealers, we were not really impressed or satisfied with any of the options we saw.

From going through their inventory online, I realized that this car is probably the cheapest car they are selling. However, this is where I was thoroughly impressed by the way Olivier treated my family. He showed us the same respect that he would have shown someone that was buying a new car from him. He was very upfront about the car and gave us really honest feedback. The whole process of buying the car was so hassle free. I don't know how the rest of the sales people are at this place, but I know that Olivier is definitely one of a kind. Although we were through with the paperwork, there was a delay for us to take the car home because they were doing some maintenance on it.

After that he started with the classic - what can I do to put you in a cart today. Then he quizzed me on the VW line. I've seen commercials for the Jetta so thats all I knew of and there was an EOS beside me in the showroom. He refused to show me any other cars and said I was making him have vertigo with my indecison. I said can I at least test drive a Jetta and see if its something I might like and perhaps the Eos. He went to get keys and when he came back he said 'upper management' said I could only test drive one car.

On the test drive he told me I was wasting his time so the test drive would be very short. At that point I agreed - it would be very short. He continued on and said I had lied to him and was more interested in price than performance. Coming from an Audi I diagreed and told him if I didn't like the way it drove it didn't matter what the price was. Then he proceeded to tell me what a great salesman he was and that he sold 400 cars a year, and he was the #2 salesman in the country. His approach cleary worked well but maybe not with me. To which I responded ""That is because you have talked down to me since we started."" 
To top it all off when I parked the demo next to my car back at the dealership. I got straight into my car and he got into the demo - and hit my car with the door of the demo.

I was interested in a VW, but the other dealerships in the area a way out of my way. So service would be an issue. This dealership is close by so this would be the place for me to get a VW. However, after this experience it looks like I will not be buying a VW at all, if ever.",1.0

David Elsea is an excellent service advisor. I trust his word implicily, and greatly appreciate knowing a service

Funny, turns out that a good friend - unbeknownst to me until recently - also only sees David when she brings her car to Park Cities. So, looks like his reputation is highly respected, and valued in the VW community.

Steve did a wonderful job working with his team at Park Cities to put me in the car of my college dreams for the price I wanted to pay; actually better!

I was on my way to visit an Audi and Lexus dealership when I noticed the VW dealership. A friend had recently purchased a Jetta TDI from that dealership and has been very pleased with it and I was curious about the new Passat that had just arrived to the showrooms so I pulled in. I glanced at a Passat and decided that it was not luxurious enough for what I wanted and started to leave when a beautiful CC caught my eye. I walked over to glance at the interior when Mr. Wyatt approached me and asked if he could be of assistance. I replied no thank you, that I was looking for something a little more luxurious and sporty and also wanted at least 30 mpg. He pointed out that the CC is rated at 31 mpg and invited me to have a seat in the car.  A couple of hours later and after a test drive I was so impressed by the features and quality of the car that I realized my search for a new car had ended almost the moment it started. At this point I had to rush off to work so I placed a deposit on the car and left. While working the entire weekend I gave it much thought and came up with a few questions. Upon returning to the dealership Monday I was promptly greeted by Steve Wyatt who answered all my questions and finished up the paperwork.

713,"August 25, 2011","Honestly my husband and I have not had great experiences with this dealership's service department before, so when my headlight went out, I was dreading taking my car in.  That said, this time, David Elsea has been absolutely wonderful.  While they were fixing my light, they found two little lights that also needed to be replaced, and went ahead and took care of those.  They noticed I had open recalls on my car and spoke to me to set up a time, but I just couldn't work that into my schedule right now.  Then my steering wheel light came on.  David managed to fit me in the next day and found me a loaner, which was necessary and so very cool of him.  He called me later that day to tell me what was wrong with my steering wheel, the cost, and his honest opinion of what i should do.  I've never had that from a dealership, and I GREATLY appreciated it.  $1,800 just isn't in our budget right now.

714,"August 24, 2011","I wanted to bring in my jetta for the state inspection. Knowing that I may have brake issues, I recognized that this kind of servicing would require a great deal of time. After phoning a couple of different dealerships, Ted understood that as a single mom I did not have hours to waste sitting in a waiting room. He was the only one to offer the use of a rental car until mine was repaired. That got me in the door. Others offered shuttling service within a 10-15 mile radius- that only gets me halfway home. Upon arrival, I was promptly taken care of. We discussed possible scenarios regarding my brakes, and state inspection. After using the rental vehicle  to get my errands done, I received a phone call from Ted about my car. My tires were worn to the point of not being able to pass state. I became very anxious, he assured me that he would take care of everything and that if needed, keep the rental overnight until the car was ready. Only problem- I worked the next day and would be unable to pickup my car or return theirs. Not only did he bring my car to my place of employment, brought the necessary paperwork and took the rental for me back to the rental place. All this done on his lunch hour. He understood my situation, he was empathetic to my needs and he accomodated them, he made me feel confident in his work, Ted made the prices more than reasonable,  he took time to explain things to me.  He went out of his way to make sure I didn't have to go out of mine. Making this potentially expensive, long drawn out servicing into an efficient, exceptionally priced, well taken care experience.

Their communication was clear and consistent and the staff saw me as a person with specific needs, not just a number to push through a process.

Also, as a woman, you always feel a bit vulnerable when your car is being worked on, that you will be taken advantage of in some way, not knowing what is actually wrong with the car. Not here. I truly felt like they only repaired what needed to be done and fairly explained everything they did on the vehicle.

722,"August 16, 2011","Volkswagen Park Cities A+++
As a first time car buyer let me just express how nervous I was about choosing a vehicle that I loved but most importantly was reliable and that I could afford. From day one all the dealers made me feel like buying my first car was something that I could do and that they would be there every step of the way to assist me in doing so.

Day one of visiting the dealership Steve Wyatt made me and my dad feel like family! He greeted us on the lot with a friendly smile and warm welcome and wanted to know what I wanted to test drive first! 

Also day one Steve and the dealerships manager David Hagler worked closely with my dad to crunch numbers and get me to an affordable price bracket.

After a few days and a few more test drives I ended up with the perfect car...
A 2012 VW Jetta. Matt Hewison was there to deliver the great news to me after going to bat with financing being that I was a new buyer. 

The night we closed the deal Myron Marcyniak was eager to show me all the cool features my Jetta had to offer....His excitement made me even more excited.

The amazing customer service didn’t stop the night we closed the deal! I went back a few days later to have my new car detailed. Again Steve Wyatt greeted me at the door and called me by name. He asked what I was getting done and told me to take a load off and relax while they worked on my car. David Hagler came into the lounge that day and wanted to know all the details about how I liked my new car. He congratulated me again and told me as soon as I ran out of gas to come on back in so he could fill it back up!! 
I also was greeted by Matt and Myron during my service visit which made me feel extremely welcomed into the Volkswagen family.

Aside from the wonderful customer service, my Jetta is remarkable!! It has all the features, heated seating, alloy wheels, voice dial, and a monster sound system. The ride is so smooth and it’s totally what I was looking for in a vehicle. 

 I just want to say thank you, thank you, thank you VW for making my first car buying experience perfect and for going above and beyond to make me feel welcomed!!

I got a great car with a super tech package for my work on the road.  The hard top makes this a quite ride.  With the top down, it's one HOT car.  Great pickup and handling for the money.

782,"May 12, 2011","We looked for a VW at Park Cities, Richardson VW and Rusty Wallis VW and found dealing with Park Cities the most straight forward. Coming from the UK our approach to buying cars is more about the transaction and ticking the right criteria in terms of the product and price rather than about building relationship with the dealer. Olivier Zitoun was easy to deal with and gave us options on both new and used models, arranged prompt test drives and provided recommendations in terms of price versus specification. Olivier provided us the opportunity to go through the various specifications and prices in our own time before we sealed the deal and he arranged for better Finance deal than my bank was offering and enabled us to collect the car on the same day so thanks to Olivier and the team at Park Cities. I would recommend doing your research on line about the model and have a budget in mind so that time spent with the sales team is productive and Olivier and the Park Cities team can guide you more effectively through the product ranger and negotiate accordingly.",4.8

I've bought several cars over the last couple of years (extended family), and this was the fastest and easiest transaction of all.  Israel also was very knowledgeable about the VW models.

After taking it in for servicing several times, I made up my mind that I would not return to Boardwalk ever again based on how I was treated during those times.  Unfortunately, I had to return because an issue resurfaced.  I called my service advisor (Lori, who was great) and found that she was no longer with the company and received Aaron Allison's name as her replacement.

In meeting her, I told her all of the concerns that I had and why I wasn't happy with Boardwalk.  She immediately took ownership and promised to make the situation better.  And I must say that since meeting Aaron, I've returned several times. It's her commitment to her customer and her desire to make things right that has me returning to the dealership.  She’s been diligent in following up with me to make sure that everything’s going well and letting me know that she’s always there if I needed any help.

We didn't have a desperate need for one, but would have liked to have walked away with something in place of our old Mazda Tribute. Luckily for us, the first person to greet us was Reid. He was anything but the pushy, over enthusiastic car salesman we were expecting. He understood our needs, our reasonings, and what we wanted to get out of the exchange. He wanted to make sure we were comfortable with the vehicle before he ever tried to ""push"" it on to us-- and he never pushed anything onto us. All decisions were led by us. We felt like we were sitting there with a family member instead of a stranger trying to get us to buy something.

Additionally, Matt was able to get us an amazing deal, and our new car costs less than our old one! We were shocked at how helpful he was.

We told Reid and Matt both while we were there that they made this experience not only easy, but enjoyable. We hadn't been shopping for cars at all, so this just happened to be the first dealer we stopped into. If any other sales or finance people had helped us, I'm confident we would have walked away without a car. Both Reid and Matt stayed over an hour past closing time to complete our transaction, and followed up with us on Monday. We've told all of our friends and family that the next time they need a car, they need a Volkswagen! But only if they work with Reid and Matt.

Surprisingly, I was treated better at the VW dealership than at the luxury dealerships.  My service advisor has genuinely shown interest in making sure I have a good experience.  This includes making arrangements for a ride home or a loaner car, giving me phone calls with status updates, and ensuring that the work is completed timely and efficiently.  Overall, I am pleased with the car, the dealership, and especially my service advisor.  Thanks, Robert!",5.0
841,"February 23, 2011","After getting the run-around trying to get a filing charge cost at McKinney VW, I decided it was time to seek out another dealership.  Within 10 minutes of meeting Matt, I had all the information I was looking for, and saved $400+ on the extended warranty on my in-lease Touareg!  Matt was completely up-front with me and made the transaction 100% smooth and painless.  We spoke on Saturday night for about 45 minutes total, going over finance rates, warranty options, etc.  Matt had finished his shift when I arrived, yet he stayed to go over everything with me.  At the end of the 45 minutes, he told me he would have all the paperwork done on Monday and call me to come down to sign them.  I am physically disabled and am unable to stand or sit for much more than 15 or 20 mins at a time.  

Having purchased many vehicles in the last 25 years, I had little hope that the transaction on Monday would go smoothly.  Matt called me on Monday, just as he said he would, and I drove down to the dealership.  To my utter amazement, I was there only 12 minutes and the entire deal was DONE (All paperwork signed, and I was out the door)!!!  Matt and the team at Park Cities VW have reset the bar to an all-time HIGH, in my humble opinion, when it comes to 'no-bull' direct dealing, going the extra-mile to get the best interest rate, and keeping their word when they say they will do something.  I have never been so pleasantly shocked with a car purchase as I am with this one!  

Just to point out how far I went to go to Park Cities VW....I live ONE HALF OF A MILE from Lewisville VW (where I originally leased the car in 2008).  Due to multiple nightmares at Lewisville VW's SERVICE DEPT, I refuse to ever do business with them again.  I have been going to Metro VW for service since, but their finance rep failed to return my call in regards to this purchase(it's been 4 days now with no return call!).  I then offered McKinney VW my business, but they kept dodging a straight-forward question (how much do you charge for the title-transfer/registration-application paperwork).  They kept telling me I had to bring the car in first to have it looked over before they could tell me what price they charge to do the paperwork.  After speaking with the sales rep numerous times in emails and finally a second phone call, he told me he would email the figure no-later than 'first-thing' Saturday morning.  Well, Saturday came and went, and no email from the rep...but I did receive a marketing email from his General Manager....LOL.  Just as I finished signing the paperwork at Park Cities VW on MONDAY, the sales rep from McKinney called me and left a voicemail on my phone telling me his weekend was BUSY and that I 'should understand' but he was now ready to go over the numbers.  You snooze, you lose in sales!

Do yourself a favor, save yourself time grief and aggravation....don't bother calling any other VW dealers in the DFW area....or at least make sure you call Park Cities LAST!  They will put all others to shame with their top-notch customer service!  You can take this review to the bank!  I am not only a reviewer, I am a COMPLETELY SATISFIED CUSTOMER!!!

Thank you very much MATT, you are AWESOME!!!!

The Service team, the Financial team and my recent encounter with Mr. Steve Wyatt was esceptional. These people make Park City the best VW dealership that I know.  Mr. Wyatt was understainding of my need for a new car.  He worked with me to help me achive the best possible deal for the car. 

My husband was extremely impressed with Mr. Wyatt because of his honesty as to what he could do to get us in a new 2011 CC Pasatt. I thougth Mr. Wyatt was charming and patient with me.  I was a little apprehenvsive about getting a new car, but I knew we needed one. Mr. Wyatt went into detail with us both about the differnt functions of the car.

I was pleased to hear from Mr. Wyatt as a follow-up call with us about how we were enjoying the car.  He extened his knowledge and experience if we had any questions about our new car and he immediatley assigend us a service person whom I had worked with before and is pleased to be working with him again.  My experience was a pleasuable one.  I know I will be dealing with them in the future.

855,"February 14, 2011","We just purchased on Friday our fifth car  from this dealership. Our relationship began in 2000. I can still remember the relationship we began back then and yes some of the sales & service people have come and gone since then, but I can say that we have not had one moment of service reflect the changes in personel. We have seen Matt Hewison advance with Park Cities and taken great comfort in working with him. He has shown us nothing but great respect and confidence in our financial deals and as always we have never felt that we did not get the best deal we could receive. We believe under the leadership of Robert Rippy the dealership has shown us respect and treated us as though we where one of the elite customers of Park Cities. 

When our cars required service we where always treated as though our needs where the most important and there was never a hassle and no inconvience to us other than to drive from North Richland Hills to Dallas, I have never minded the drive because I knew when I got there I would be taken care of in the most efficienct way possible and my wait has never been unreasonable. If Park Cities had an issue I was never inconvienced in any way.They have always provided me with transportation until my vehicle was serviced and returned. I have had a couple of accidents that Park Cities stepped up to the plate and handle it well above what was required to make sure that I was not inconvenienced.

I have never felt that we have every said enough in the way of thank you to all those at Park Cities. We have taken our relationship for granted and one should never do this especially in this day in time when pride of service can sometimes be come a thing of the past and respect given to Customers is rarely seen. But both my husband RD Tucker wish to thank each of you for everything thing you have done for us and hope that we will continue to receive such fine service in our relationship with Park Cities. 

Sincerly,
Linda Tucker ",5.0

858,"February 07, 2011","Bottom line; do not deal with Steve Wyatt or Pete Hodges. Steve Wyatt is the most dishonest sales person I have encountered.  Just remembering the unpleasant experience that I had with Steve makes me want to vomit in my mouth.  I told him repeatedly that I did not appreciate the run around he was giving me and that I was no longer interested in buying a car at Park Cities/Boardwalk. As I started to walk out to leave he ran after me telling me that I was the one losing out on a “great deal.”  Then he had the nerve to email the next day when I had made it very clear to him that I was not interested in buying any vehicle from him or anyone at Park Cities/ Boardwalk VW the day before.  He continued to email several times until I threatened to forward his emails to the VW Corporate office for harassment. 

As for Pete he loves to play the finance game with you and wants to know “what number” will work for you. After I told him I wasn’t playing the name your monthly payment game and that I wanted to get the lowest price on the vehicle that I could, he started to get pissed off.  These guys love to try to pull one over on the customer.  They think that everyone who walks through the doors of Boardwalk is ignorant and they make sure that you feel this way. 

I ended up getting my VW from Hiley VW in Arlington and my buying experience was very pleasant, absolutely no run around on pricing. Save yourself some time and a headache and stay away from Park Cities/ Boardwalk VW and go to another VW dealership in DFW. ",1.0
859,"December 27, 2010","Really bad service from the ""service"" department - bad customer service, bad mechanical service and bad representation.  All around this dealership sucks.  My first buying experience with VW was horrible - but I accepted that because I thought I really wanted the car.  Sadly I should have walked out of there before buying. Now, after paying off my 2004 VW Passat, I've had nothing but trouble with this car and the people at the dealership.  I've spent over $5K in less than 2 years since it's been paid off, on major engine and other problems.  The service reps have consistently been rude, arrogant and condescending and have no sympathy or concern for the customer's needs.  Totally hate this place.  Unfortunately I am stuck now with a VW problem that's going to cost me another $2000.00 - the ""oil sludge"" issue, for which VW was sued in a class action lawsuit and they lost.  (If you own a VW - be sure you understand this problem)  VW settlement requires you to have any repairs related to this issue done by VW to have any kind of reimbursement. When I took it to this particular dealership, they were unaware of the settlement and it was just another hassle to deal with.  DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE!  more importantly - DO NOT BUY A VW.  ",1.0

Just a Regular Guy

Call me naïve, idealistic, or trusting; in the end call me whatever you’d like, I still think a car buying experience shouldn’t leave you feeling like you wet your pants on the first day of school.  I tend to analyze, perhaps to a fault, but after reviewing this situation I’m thankful for my perspective.  Interested in trading in my little compact car for a compact SUV I quickly fell in love with the style of the VW.  I requested a quote on a 2010 Tiguan SEL fully loaded with leather interior, panoramic sunroof, and navigation system through the VW website.  I quickly received responses from 3 local dealerships and fired back a couple of questions.  Two days and thirty e-mails later I completed the pre-approval application online and planned a visit to a dealership, Park Cities Volkswagen of Richardson.  I chose this dealership because they quoted me the lowest price initially and Olivier seemed to have a great personality and was attentive and eager to respond.  
It was established through my application that I would need a co-signer or a down payment.  After discussing it with my boyfriend he agreed to co-sign if the deal was right.  I made it clear I would not be interested in purchasing the vehicle unless my payment was under $600/month.  Olivier quickly agreed he would tell me instantly if the deal could not be done so no time would be wasted.  I hadn’t actually seen a Tiguan in person so I headed to the dealership to take a look and get a quote for my trade in.  Upon arrival they quickly took my keys and began their inspection while I took a look at the Tiguan.  At this time I was informed they did not have the actual car on the lot but “they could get it”.  I was shown a Tiguan S, and a Tiguan Wolfsburg.  I expressed my disappointment in the actual vehicle of interest not being on the lot and was informed there is only ONE in the state of TX and all of the dealerships were fighting over it.  I then told Olivier that I had requested quotes from two other dealerships and was told the car was on the lot.  He then told me they were liars, and car salesman so they would tell me anything to get me in the door.  He himself was not a car salesman, just a regular guy that happens to work at a dealership that “really doesn’t know shit about cars” and had only been in the business five months.  I did not test drive the vehicle, we thought it would be wise to see if the numbers would work first.
Quickly sucked into the back and forth haggling that car buying is Olivier insisted he was going to “coach” me on this deal but if his manager found out it would cost him his job.  The initial offer was laid on the table and Olivier told me which numbers to scratch out and what do replace them with.  At this time, something at the top of the paper caught my attention.  The offer was for the Wolfsburg Trim, not the SEL Trim as I had requested and was misled to believe we were discussing all along.  I quickly pointed this out and was told there are NO SEL’s in the state of TX.  During this negotiation I begin texting my boyfriend; he would have final say in the matter after all.  This is when I saw the first rude streak in Olivier (aside from the frequent use of profanity which I would not encourage unless the other person had already cursed in conversation, but I chalked this up to him being just a regular guy, and not an experienced car salesman as he liked to point out multiple times).  Olivier told me to “pay attention”.  Perhaps he thought I was still contacting other dealers to validate his statements. 
Olivier went to his manager’s office, as they do, to work the deal for me.  He returned with a sheet of paper wanting my boyfriend’s information.  I told him he would have to talk to him to get it and that I would need to discuss it with him first.  After texting him, he wanted me to alter the deal.  I voiced the response to Olivier who quickly disappeared again, only to return and inform me that they had not even agreed to the last terms I put on the table and it was clear I was not the decision maker so they were done haggling.  He then walked off while I was continuing my conversation with my boyfriend and when he returned and I told him we wanted to go over the numbers he then insulted my boyfriend by telling me he was too controlling.  I told Olivier I did not agree; he has every right to make the decision if he has to be on the loan.  My keys were retrieved and I left the dealership.
I then decided to do a little research on my own.  I found out that this 5 month car salesman has reviews dating back to November of 2007.  I also found out there are SEL Trims in the state of Texas.  Word of advice to Olivier Zitoun; if being a regular guy doesn’t work out, try being a car salesman.

Do NOT buy a car from Boardwalk VW and do NOT service your VW at this location. My husband bought his 2nd VW from this location, because they could not fix his first car. Upon purchasing our new car, the agent wrote the contract wrong, with a higher sales price. He rushed us through and did not explain anything. We returned a few days later to get a new contract drawn. The agent was less than happy to help us. A few months after the purchase, the sunroof got stuck opened. We took it in and they ""fixed"" it. A month later, the radio went out. VW assured us that we would get a new radio in a few days. We called and called, but nobody could give us status on the radio. Two weeks later, we went to VW and was told that the radio sat in their office for a week and had to return it to the manufacturer because WE did not call to check status. A week after that, the sunroof glass busted while driving down the highway. Glass shattered all over the car. We took the car in and they said it was not covered under our warranty, because they could not prove that we did not break it ourselves. They still could not give us status on the radio. We had to call our insurance company to cover the sunroof. At first, they told us that it was just the glass needing to be replaced...but ended up being the whole sunroof needing to be replaced ($1,800).
