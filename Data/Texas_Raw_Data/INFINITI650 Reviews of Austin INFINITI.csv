1,"June 18, 2020","We were very satisfied with our purchase of a QX60 from your dealership.  Joe Nichols was an excellent salesman and supported us throughout the purchase process.  We are isolating due to the virus and were able to get everything done online.  Thank you for delivering the car to us.  And I need to also send a shout out to your service department.  Monte Reger is an excellent service advisor and a big reason that we decided to purchase another Infiniti from your dealership.

21,"April 15, 2020","Scheduled appointment with Allan D. to go over option for my QX70S end of Lease.  I was really leaning towards turning the QX70S from a Lease to a purchase.  Main reasoning was the 3.7ltr. engine in the QX70S (Never had 1 issue, Torque and HP was very good.  Allan was very knowledgeable on the 3.0LTT engine and eased my initial concerns.  The test drive with the Q60S Red Sport sealed my decision.  Time will tell if the 3.0LTT is as reliable as the 3.7ltr., but I'm having funny driving the 2019 Q60S Red Sport 400.  Also, my experience with Ray J. in Finance was the best experience I have ever had when purchasing a vehicle.

I appreciate the time and effort from the whole Austin Infiniti Team.",5.0

We've received patient, personalized, and friendly service all the way through- from making sure we were happy with our decision on which vehicle to buy on day 1 to their continued dedication to make sure we feel like valued clients when we've had questions and received service.  This is truly appreciated, especially as we've purchased pre-owned vehicles from them.  An added bonus - the dealership is very nicely maintained and is a very comfortable place to be if needing to wait for an oil change etc.  The pairing of Austin Infiniti along with the quality and enjoyment of driving both our Infiniti QX80 and QX56 just can't be beat!

She went above and beyond the call of duty by attending me as soon as I arrived to the dealer, having a loaner vehicle ready for me to get back to work, and staying in contact with me through the process.

The primary reasons that I've chosen Infiniti is for the comfort and utility of each vehicle. Monte Reger has been a key component in providing all of my vehicles the best of care in an extremely timely, professional and caring manner.  Monte always makes me feel like I'm his only customer.

45,"January 05, 2020",The worst part of car buying is the amount of time it takes once you've decided to buy.  Not true with Troy and his team at Austin Infiniti!

55,"December 10, 2019","I was pulling out of my driveway when the tire warning light came on and I saw that one of my tires was 6 psi lower than the other three.  I knew that wasn't good, so I went straight to the dealership knowing that I did not have an appointment, but hoping they could get me in.  My service adviser, Latoya, was able to get me in quickly.  Turns out, there was a nail in my tire.  They also fixed a recall while I was there.  I had purchased the tire protection plan when I leased my car, so there was no charge for my repairs as everything was covered under the protection plan and warranty.  I enjoyed a nice latte and pastry, and watched ESPN while I waited.  I was in and out in under 2 hours, which I thought was great since I did not have a pre-scheduled appointment.  Everyone there is so helpful and professional.  I highly recommend this dealership and service department.  I'm on my 2nd Infiniti and I'm a customer for life.",5.0

60,"November 29, 2019","Excellent service-  They were very attentive to my mechanical needs during the week of Thanksgiving.  I had to have my truck towed from Temple to Austin due to grinding noise and I did not want to risk further damage. As would any customer I was very concerned about the expense of the service needed.  Mr. Monte informed me about an auto repair finance program that would allow me to finance the remaining balance after warranty.  Mr. Monte recommended that the front brakes be replaced during this service.

Needless to say I am grateful for the service rendered and information provided. I drove away from the Austin dealership with peace of mind.",5.0

75,"October 15, 2019","I received notice from Infiniti that my car might need a new
actuator for the ABS system.  
I scheduled the appointment 2 weeks ahead.  They evaluated the 
QX60 quickly and determined it was involved in the recall.
They issued me a loaner QX60 and I was off.  However,
they later notified me that they did not have the part and 
it would take 2 additional days.  
The recall replacement was done, they inspected the car,
changed the battery (under warranty) and washed it up.

Overall, I am quite pleased, but wished they would have ordered 
the part in the two weeks before my appointment to avoid the 
extra two day wait.",4.4

I got a call the night before the service to let me know no loaners were available and give me the option of rescheduling.  I chose to go in and the care I got form Chris was superb.  Good communication - and I liked the video form the tech.
Since it was my first time there - the only negative is the confusing signage to direct me to the service check-in. Right off Burnet Road it sends you through the garage and into the back of the check in and in a lane parallel to the normal check in.",5.0

Once that information was cleared the time from start to finish was quick and I was updated on time line promptly. ,4.2
93,"August 19, 2019","Cody was by far the most amazing salesman I have ever worked with.  He was humble in his approach, knowledgeable of the product, and worked tirelessly to make a purchase work with our given circumstance.  I have never had a great car purchasing experience prior to this visit.  That is why I have no brand loyalty when it comes to purchasing another vehicle.  That will change in it comes time to upgrade.  I will be buying an Infinity and hopefully get a chance to work with Cody again.",5.0

It starts with old-fashioned personal interaction to clearly communicate your service request and then a text message pops up on your cellphone with radio button ""accept""/""decline"" for every issue found by technicians.

He didn't suggest unnecessary or more costly work/products, and he wasn't patronizing when he explained what needed to be done.

209,"December 26, 2018","When I went shopping for a pre-owned car I ended up here after 3 tries at other dealerships. First try they didn't have exactly the combination I wanted (white exterior, light interior), but they had black and tan. So, needing a car I took it. Great car, but I was still disappointed about exterior color. Approximately 2.5 wks later I brought it in for a infrared window treatment. While there, I asked Danny if by any chance he'd seen my unicorn car (I know I shouldn't have😊), but couldn't help myself! He hesitated, bc he knew I had purchased the vehicle less than 3wks earlier, and then confessed that exactly what I had been looking for (and more) had come in the day b4! While I was elated but a bit nervous to call my husband and discuss, Danny gave me privacy and was suitably understanding to both of us. There was a 5k difference (more) on price that my husband was not keen to pay bc ir was a year older model. The reason was explained, (many more upgrades). In the end we paid it and I got my unicorn car! Good service and I was 100% happy. My husband not as much...

243,"October 04, 2018","I have always hated the whole car shopping experience. I only purchase used cars out of personal preference and had looked for a good while at different car lots and dealerships and always felt as if the salesmen viewed me as unintelligent or were just extremely pushy. I found the car I purchased through Inifinity Austin through a website and went to look and testdrive. I was introduced to Dana, a salesman there, and he promptly took me out to the car to look over it all and go for a drive. Never once did I get that awkward feeling that tends to come with having a saleman around. Dana stood back and let me look it over and let me ask the questions, which I greatly appreciated. Never once did Dana prompt me that I needed to act on purchasing the car that same day and didn't harass me the following days. Now I was the one that stopped in 5 different times throughout the next week to look at the car more and test drove again to ""make sure she was the one"". Everyone at Infinity Austin was very patient and helpful each time I dropped in and Dana, especially, has the patient of a Saint to deal with my indecisiveness. When I made my decision to go through with the purchase, they made sure that everything was in working order (back AC blower had gone out and they fixed, which is rare for used car sales!!) and gave it a wash. My overall experience was very smooth and as pleasant as signing a huge check can be. I am hopeful that Dana and the Infinity Austin will have another great used car option for me when it comes time for me to get another! I highly reccomend going to them if you enjoy and prefer not feeling pressured. Be sure to ask for Dana Woodbury!!",4.8

Over the years, I have sometimes been a challenging customer.  For example, I had always heard you should not buy tires at the dealership.  But Dave asked me why I would go somewhere else for tires, when I can get them at Austin Infiniti, where I know I will get great quality and service.  I took his advice and have no regrets.  Dave is a man of great integrity, who is always calm and pleasant, no matter what problems I throw at him.

She was efficient and pleasant to speak with. When we went in for our appointment, you could feel a calming energy walking in the doors. Nothing like other dealerships I have visited. Met with Tereso, a salesman, who was very professional and pleasant to work with. We were able to go home and discuss if this was the vehicle we wanted to purchase and come back in the next day to make the purchase. Not once were we pressured into making a purchase. In the process of making the purchase we also had Kathryn come in to the office to talk about some design options that we could add to our vehicle and again, we were never pressured into purchasing add-ons. Then there was Laura in finance. We actually had pre-approval with a bank prior to coming in so the time spent back there signing was minimal. However, after a week we were unable to complete the paperwork with the bank as the numbers were never correct. We called Laura back to explain the situation. She was prompt and very willing to help finalize paperwork with INFINITI. This ended up working out even better for us as we got an even lower interest rate. This was overall the best experience.

Anyone can buy and sell cars, exceptional people like those mentioned will bring back your customers.  John explaining the features of the car was something I have not experienced before, I thought the Infiniti in Augusta, Ga where I purchased my first Infiniti was great, you guys are better.  

Great People!!!

317,"April 09, 2018","The staff at Infinite has always been great. I would recommend for new/used car sales but would say shop for service..The service guys are all excellent as well and they are in the business of selling service. The cost for just about any repair or general maintenance is higher than if you take it elsewhere - $484 for spark plugs (really) when google said between $100-$300 depending on make and model. I spent just under $1,000 ($242 for parts and $740 for labor) for fairly basic maintenance and after I shopped each item I could have saved about $3 -$400. Although I did get a ""free"" car wash and loaner vehicle for the day that may be part of their pricing. This is not a complaint just felt like I overpaid so have lost a bit of trust in the service side of the equation and that they could be more competitive with their pricing.   ",4.0

321,"April 05, 2018","Infiniti offers a great car for a great value, which sells itself in a lot of ways.  However the reason i came back to this Infiniti dealership without even really considering any others is that Tony Anthony was such a pleasure to work with on my first Infiniti lease in 2015.  It's not easy to take the stress and pressure out of car-buying, but Tony was the best i have ever worked with.  This time around, Joe Morales picked up right where Tony left off, and definitely gave him a run for his money in terms of salesmanship.  Joe was very respectful of my time, listened carefully to what i was looking for, added his knowledge of the products where it was appropriate and helpful, and was up front and straightforward about pricing and options.  I can also say that Ray Jaladoni in the finance department made the paperwork easy and answered all my questions clearly and concisely.

While at the dealership I ""dropped in"" on Tony Anthony who has assisted me with my last several leases. My current lease expires in 10 months but I had received an e-mail to be in touch with Tony to discuss the lease and options when the current lease ended. Although Tony was not expecting me, he too welcomed me warmly and took time to review my lease records and discuss what options I want in my next lease. It was helpful to have this conversation well in advance so he and I both know the general timetable for ""trading in"" this lease for the next.

We did a pre-approved through Capital Car Navigator for a car we wanted and and saw that Infinity was a preferred dealership. We used TrueCar to get a bid and we were called within two minutes by the dealership representative. Juan Lujan assisted us through a quick and painless process which took less than 2 hours our first day (including the test drive), and just so we didn't have to wait a couple more hours to speak with financing (there were some people ahead of us), he made an appointment for us to come in the next day to finish the process. Juan answered all of our questions and gave us first-class treatment. He had noticed that the owner's manual was somewhat ragged looking when he was getting the car ready and so he took the initiative to order a new one and will have it sent to us. That was a really nice surprise which shows his commitment to excellence.
Our car was detailed and a full tank of gas when we came in to sign the papers. The staff of Austin Infinity made sure that an open recall was fixed, and even found an unlisted recall which was also fixed for us. Signing the papers was quick and in less than an hour and a half we were driving our new(ish) used car.",4.8

My experience was nothing short of EXCEPTIONAL beginning with my first call!  This is a classy dealership with a highly professional and friendly staff.  

HOWARD SHAW in New Car Sales/Leasing was truly a God send.  I desperately needed a new vehicle because my car was totally TOTALED (lol).  I discussed my situation, gave Howard the specifics, and he took over from there.  He is the most thorough, knowledgeable, PATIENT, honest, and kind salesman that I have ever encountered.  Howard has an easy-going spirit and his professionalism is unmatched.  It was apparent immediately that he truly cares about his customers, and is willing to go above and beyond to ensure their satisfaction.  He thought of everything and left no page unturned.  He was also able to get the car I wanted from a dealership in Dallas because it was not in stock.  Howard worked a GREAT DEAL on my new ride!!!  I’ve experienced the “HOWARD MAKES IT HAPPEN” from a former customer’s written review, and I couldn’t agree more!  

Laura Black (Design Center Consultant) is truly a gem as well.  She too is very knowledgeable and professional with a beautiful personality.  My interaction with Mike Marsalis (Finance/Business Manager) was also STELLAR.  He was as cool as the ocean breeze and funny to boot!  They are definitely great additions to this establishment.

In a time where the NORM for customer service (in every sector) is just HORRIFIC, my faith in the existence of EXCELLENT service was definitely RESTORED!!!  HANDS DOWN THE BEST CAR BUYING EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD!!!  I will DEFINITELY refer everyone I know to this fine dealership.  Thanks Howard and the Austin Infiniti Team!  

YOU GUYS ARE A CLASS ACT!!!

446,"June 20, 2017","Our car was totaled in an accident. We have owned two other Infiniti's in the past. We went in to look at a 2015 Q50 certified used car. After the test drive we made an offer on the car and told the salesman it was our top offer. Then began the runaround. We sat and waited for the sales person to return with his manager who we had to explain our offer to again, After listening to his sales pitch he said he and the sales person had to go back to his office and work the numbers. After waiting for them to return, the sales manager comes back and says he can't sell that car at that price unless he takes the warranty off. So we spent over three hours at the dealer for them to tell us that they can't sell the car for what we offered unless they sell the car without a warranty. Our whole reason for going there was the warranty. We could have just leased a new car but we prefer to own our vehicles. I think they could have said that when we made our offer instead of making us spend over three hours to get their counter offer. We were ready to purchase the car then but after the run around, and we were really only $500 apart. We decided to wait since we didn't need the car right away and we will be out of town for a while anyway. The dealership is beautiful, the service department looks great and our salesman was a nice guy but the buying experience on a certified car needs work. It shouldn't take that long to make a deal.

I appreciate him taking in all of the wants and needs we had and throughly understanding what our family enjoys in a SUV. We left with a beautiful new Qx80 and will definitely be back in the future.
Laura was next on our list. She was a pleasure to work with and also did not rush us. She spent a lot of additional time with my wife to ensure she knew how to work everything in the vehicle and assured us we could come back for additional guidance if needed. She was a pleasure! 
Both Brad and Laura were appreciative and thoughtful throughout our interactions. 
Stephanie in finance was a pleasure to work with as well. She was quick and worked the numbers into our car budget to meet our goals. She also volunteered to drive by our home to pick up the rest of our deposit money and voided check for our ACH today; that was much appreciated as it saved us a trip to Austin from Georgetown.

486,"March 10, 2017","I purchased my car, new, three years ago at a dealership in San Antonio where I've taken it for all of its service until this time. It was due to go in and time to get new tires and I decided I'd try out Austin Infinity having heard from various sources that it's service Dept was exceptional
My sources proved accurate!  It took less than 5 minutes to set up the appointment and the person with whom I spoke could not have been nicer or more helpful.  When I got there, I was greeted immediately and introduced to my service advisor, Monte Reger.  He could not have been more pleasant and professional. My (very nice, immaculately clean) loaner was waiting for me and no less than 3 people asked if I needed help transferring items from my car.
I told Monte that I live 2 hours away and was hoping that my car would be ready in time for me to avoid the worst traffic. Three hours later, my car was ready giving me plenty of time to get out of town before traffic got bad. When I got home, I compared prices between Austin Infinity and the one I'd gone to previously.  I was surprised to find a significant difference in prices - in my favor!   The best part of all was that the service performed was exactly what the manual states that it needed and I was not strong-armed into having other additional work performed (unlike my experience with my former dealership).  I say ""former"" because I plan to return to Austin Infinity for all future service in spite of the fact that it's a 2 hour drive as opposed to a 20 minute one.

587,"April 21, 2015","Austin Infiniti gave me everything I wanted and more. I was checking out program offers through my employer and filled out a form to see what type of discount I might get on an Infiniti. Within 3 minutes of submitting the form, I was contacted by the local dealership and transferred to salesman Tony Anthony.

I admitted two things to Tony over the phone. 
1) I felt Infiniti was a bit above my price range
2) I had looked at the G37 convertible 5 years ago when I purchased my last car and absolutely loved it, but it was considerably more than I had budgeted to spend.

Tony listened, and invited me to come out and drive the Q60 convertible the next evening. I figured I would at least drive the car this time (5 years ago I didn't want to torture myself by driving something I could not have). Between that phone call and the test drive, I spent time doing some research. I put together the options I would want and determined the MSRP. I then checked with TrueCar (this is a TrueCar certified dealer!) and found that I could get the car below MSRP. I also checked to see how the car was trending in sales and found I might be able to get it at slightly lower than the TrueCar price.

Additionally, I looked into financing. I found the best rate available at a local Credit Union, and confirmed with them I could finance through them with no money down at a great rate.

When I got to the dealership, Tony was great. He listened to what I wanted in the vehicle and he told me what he had in stock that matched what I wanted. He also showed me a price that was even lower than I had thought I might pay. Talk about not needing to haggle! We took a test drive and I loved this car. I looked at a couple different choices on the lot and selected the one I wanted.

I told Tony and his finance manager, Chris Morton, that I was secure in getting financing through the local Credit Union and told them the rate. Chris asked me to give him a chance to match the rate, so i filled out an application. The next morning, Tony let me know that Chris had found a lender who would beat my best rate! This purchase just kept getting better!

I arranged an appointment to complete the purchase the following day. I was at the dealership for less than an hour. My car was already prepped and waiting in the showroom. I signed papers with Chris, had a quick tutorial with Tony on the car instrumentation, and was introduced to the service director, Mark Bailey, who let me know about upcoming events.

I must say, this was a fantastic, stress free experience. Did I mention i love my new car? ",5.0

600,"July 12, 2014","We don't normally like to visit dealers as there will always be sales pressure, however, we were looking at an Infinity QX60 online and it looked quite nice. We had no experience with Nissan or Infiniti before so we decided to give a visit to the dealer. We met with Chris Corn, who was very polite and able to answer all of our questions.  During the process there was no sales pressure. We decided to do a test drive and Chris was able to select the vehicle with the right color and options that we liked. We also had a vehicle to trade in and Chris was able to get a great trade in value while at the same time offered price reduction for the new vehicle. Over the weekend we realized that the wheat interior color would be hard to maintain and keep clean, and we feared that we would not be able to enjoy it. We called Chris on Monday and expressed our concern, of which he eased and took care of immediately (it was his day off!). We came back on Tuesday and Chris had the same vehicle with a black interior ready for our exchange and I only had to redo a few of the documents (those that had VIN numbers) and we were in and out of the dealership in very short time.
Chris Corn genuinely showed that he was willing to help and resolve all of our concerns to satisfaction. I am not sure if other dealerships or sales persons would be able to perform a vehicle exchange like we experienced. Typically sales people only like to take care of new business and show less interest once the vehicle is sold. However Chris has shown exceptional customer service for pre and after sales.
I would highly recommend working with Chris Corn at this Austin Infinity dealer for a true best in class sales and customer service experience. This was the best car purchasing experience we ever had.",5.0

They got me right in allowed me and my kids to relax have a snack watch TV while they changed my oil and washed my car and vaccumed it.  Ready in the time they said, everyone was pleasant.  Also the waiting room had very few folks in it- this was a Saturday.  Later for comparison I had to take my son's Toyota in for an oil change - different experience.  Had appointment, dropped it and returned to get it.  The waiting room was jammed packed with many folks, familiies included who appeared to be there for a long while.  Said the oil change would take two hours and did call me when it was done. I went to pick it up and they lost the paper work so I had to wait while they wondered around the place to find it.  Seemed chatotic, folks husseling and scrambleing - no one was rude but I cant say they were overly friendly either. Seemed systematic - garage doors flying open, expecting me to know where to go and who to ask for - the feeling was loads of staff but I felt invisible.  Totally different experience - same result got my oil changes but pretty sure no one at Toyota knows it.  Thank you",5.0

Great car service experience dealer is especially difficult for women to find, in my experience, so it is wonderful to have found this service crew at this dealer -- friendly, customer best interests paramount, honest, fair.  They arrange rides or a loaner car for my routine service, and do little extra things at no charge (ex., wash car before returning it).  They always ask before doing extra things that would be a charge, do not overcharge, and are extremely neat and careful.  This is my first Infiniti.

He explained everything clearly and told me that they would resurface my rotors and change the brake pads in addition to the oil change under warrantee. Since today was good friday they were somewhat short staffed and the work took a bit longer than expected, so he was kind enough to comp me the oil change to make up for it.

639,"March 30, 2012","Having purchased one Infiniti automobile, on a return trip to the dealer for servicing, I mentioned to the same sales agent that I wished to purchase a second Infiniti - this time the SUV - the FX. That was over three months ago. Not once did I receive a follow up call nor email - not once. I assumed that she had dropped the ball, took my wife to the Lexus dealer and purchased the car we wanted in less than two weeks. I might add that the purchase experience and follow up at Lexus was seamless. Painless. 

Ten days ago, out of the blue, Camry called me - as I said, three months after we had spoken about the second car. She told that they had &quot;finally&quot; found the car I wanted. Having spoken to others, more senior, at the dealership, I am aware that she was not telling me the truth. She had dropped the ball which is what she should have said in the first place. She opted to lie.  Had she simply ignored me, as I assumed she did, things would have been fine. I found a car and importantly, my wife is happy with the purchase. camry's mistake was greed - the off chance of selling another car at the expense of customer satisfaction. It's unfortunate that one employee is allowed to impact the relationship. Needless to say, I will not be using her services again and I would strongly recommend that you have a back up plan in the event you are looking at Infiniti cars.",2.2
640,"February 26, 2012","Shealea Greer with Austin Infiniti made a trade offer to upgrade to a new Infiniti G37 convertible for my wife. She made the offer based on an Infiniti upgrade promotion that prior to my inquiry she admitted knowing nothing about. I accepted her offer subject to her inspection of our trade in. Anthony Raglin, a salesman with the dealership, made a trip to our home in Granbury, 3 1/2 hours away to pick up the car and take back for their inspection. I also gave Anthony a partially completed, signed, credit application and copies of my drivers license and insurance. The credit application included my social security number in order to allow them to pull a credit report to verify my credit. After they looked at the car Shealea called several times to discuss the trade value, we finally came to an agreement on the trade value which was exactly the offer amount she had previously made, the only problem, I needed to complete the credit application. I informed her I had purchased several vehicles over the last 12 months with less information than I had provided her and that all of the other dealerships simply used my social to pull credit along with a signed credit application. That was not good enough for her however as she demanded that I fill in the other items missing from the report. The other items were, my place of employment, (we are self employed and I noted that on the application I sent to her) and next of kin who did not live with us as well as some information regarding income and home mortgage. Now understand, I already have an Infiniti lease and also have other Nissan financing in place on another vehicle that was purchased earlier this year. I tried to explain to her that all she need to do was to have her F&I manager pull my credit and she could find all the information she needed. Nothing doing, it was by the book or nothing. When I told Shealea she appeared to be way over her head in as much as her ability to put a sale of this nature together she took extreme offense and cancelled the deal. I sent her a completed credit application the next morning, but she would not accept it. I would never consider doing business with this dealership unless I wanted to be treated like this was my first car I ever purchased.",1.8

We were walked through all the features of the car and Camy was very knowledgeable. The entire process was very upfront and honest.

642,"December 23, 2010","This dealer may be the best in the USA for all I know.

I just bought an Infiniti recently after years of Lexus and BMW.

The car itself is good (M45S) - it does not have the luxury of Lexus, but has better performance/handling. It does not have the performance of BMW but is more luxurious. And it has a huge trunk and fits 5 comfortably, which is awesome. 

The service is OK. Nothing bad.

However, compared to Lexus/BMW/Mercedes, the service is middling at best. When I say ""Lexus"" going forward, it means both Lexus/BMW/Mercedes.

At Lexus, when you arrive for service, someone immediately walks to your car, asks your name, brings the paperwork already printed, has you sign a car liability thing for the loaner car that is already prepared, double checks why the car is there, and then has you on your way in no time flat. The service is very fast, professional, courteous, and respectful.

By contrast, I have several times gone to Infiniti to see lots of people milling about, obviously busy, and stood there for several minutes before someone eventually walks up and asks what I want. Then, eventually, the paperwork is created and within usually 15-20 minutes you are out of there with a loaner car. Not bad but not as fast as the other luxury brands. Staff are casual - friendly enough but offhand compared to Lexus. It feels like a GM service, not a luxury brand.

At Lexus/BMW/Merc, when there is any issue of any kind, they just take care of it. Especially BMW - if something is a little out of warranty it is not unusual for them to just take care of it anyway. They really bend over backwards to give a great customer experience, and do all sorts of little things they don't really have to do. You get the feeling they want you to be 100% satisfied, and then some.

At Infiniti, by contrast, they don't give an inch. If something is a little out of warranty when you take it in, even if acting up prior, sorry Charlie you're out of luck. The rules are the rules, no exceptions. For things which cost very small amounts of money they miss an opportunity to delight, and instead are just average.

I guess that's the difference: Lexus/BMW/Mercedes really try to delight their customers, where Infiniti seems to be happy with just being OK. I think the Infiniti team think they are delighting the customer, so it is not lack of intent but lack of understanding of what it takes. They should start hiring their service mgrs from Lexus/BMW/Merc to up their game.

Because of the service experience, and for no other reason, I am planning to sell my Infiniti in Q1, and buy a Lexus, BMW or Mercedes.

Again, Infiniti service is good, not bad, but it simply does not match up to the competition.

BEWARE.  I purchased my Infiniti from a Dealer outside of Texas.  I had only been to Austin Infiniti one time to have work done on my vehicle, but maintained the vehicle impeccably – just not at Austin Infiniti.  I received a letter from Kevin Martin the Vice President of Total Customer Satisfaction via Infiniti National Consumer Affairs Department stating that they had become aware of a cosmetic issue with the dash material on vehicles like mine.  For this reason, Infiniti extended my vehicles Limited Warranty to 96 months and unlimited mileage.  Several weeks after receiving the letter, my car started to have issues with the dash that was described in the letter that I had received from Infiniti National Consumer Affairs Department.  I called Austin Infiniti to schedule an appointment with the Service Department to have the issue corrected, giving them two week notice so that they could make sure they had the parts for my vehicle.  After leaving my car with Austin Infiniti’s Service Consultant Steve Donovan, I was told my car would be ready that day.  Later that afternoon, I received a call from Steve Donovan saying that my car was not ready, and that they were not going to fix the warranty issue.  When explained why by Steve Donovan, I was told that because I had not been bringing my vehicle to Austin Infiniti for maintenance they would not fix my warranty issue.  I asked to speak with the General Manager of Austin Infiniti, Allen 'Big Al' Clauss, and he said that they are a private Infiniti Dealer and that they could refuse service to anyone they choose.  After picking up my vehicle, I contacted Infiniti National Consumer Affairs Department, to see if they could help me out.  I spoke with Emalea Reid, Regional Consumer Specialist for Infiniti North America, and after her research she stated that I would have to take my vehicle to another Infiniti Dealer.  The closes Infiniti Dealer is over 80 miles away, and who is to say that they will not refuse the vehicle warranty work as well.  When I asked Emalea Reid if I could speak with her supervisor, she refused to tell me how to reach that person or even tell me their name.  In short, it is very very confusing as to why Austin Infiniti could refuse to fix a warranty item that I was instructed by Infinity National Consumer Affairs Department to have fixed at their location.  PLEASE BEWARE OF AUSTIN INFINITI’S PRACTICES REGARDING HONORING WARRANTY WORK ON ANY INFINITI VEHICLE.

646,"February 23, 2010","From the first phone call to the final close Shealea and Camey were very responsive and very upfront about everything.  Since I don't live in an area that has an Infiniti dealership price was the most important buying factor for me.  Shealea quoted me a great price on a new 2010 G37 from the very first.  I did not have to haggle over price and I like that.  In fact, I was a little concerned that the price she gave me might not be the actual car I was wanting (we did this all over the phone and email) since it was so much lower than other quotes I had gotten.  When I asked her about it she was very straight forward with me - told me I had told her up front that I was buying on price and so she gave me her best price up front.  I like that way of doing business!  ",5.0
647,"October 14, 2009","My experience at this dealership has been great.  I own a 2003 G35 coupe which I bought from Shalea Greer.  She was very knowledgeable about the car, was always honest and truthful, and is still friendly to me when I'm in for service -  6 years after the sale.  Plus, their service department is the best I've ever encountered.  I've owned Lexus products and have had service in several of their dealerships but none of them equal Austin Infiniti.  I have never once had to return my car due to a problem not being fixed.  The drop off is always quick and the loaner car is waiting right outside the advisor's area.  I would not hesitate to buy from this dealer again but unfortunately Infiniti doesn't make a car that interests me at the present.  I'm hopeful one will come along in the next couple of years.  My only complaint might be their lease rates weren't as good as some of the other Infiniti dealers in the state.  That might have more to do with the timing of my purchase, though.",4.8
648,"January 23, 2004","I typically buy an average of two new cars per year to drive. I don't really have much brand loyalty to any one manufacturer so I try to drive as many different cars as possible. I decided to go take a look at the new infiniti FX45 in september at Austin Infiniti. I was test drving the FX45 no later than 20 min. after walking into the dealership and had a quote on the car by the end of the hour. The best part was that I was wearing my torn jeans, teva sandals, and a t-shirt that I workout in and the guys there treated me no different than their most valued customer. I checked prices on similar FX's from other dealers and the Austin Infiniti qoute was less, and this was after I told the other dealers that I had already gotten a quote from Austin Infiniti. I am sold on the service and quality of service of this dealer. Probably not going anywhere else for a while.",4.3
649,"December 08, 2003","I recently purchased a 2004 G35 Sedan from this dealer.  If there had been an alternate dealer in Austin or San Antonio that had the vehicle I wanted, I would have left and gone there based on my experience.  For that matter, I nearly left to go to Sewell Infiniti in Dallas since when I spoke with them on the phone they were much more helpful and courteous.Since my employer is a vendor used by Nissan, I am eligible for Nissan's Vehicle Purchase Program.  Based on this, I took a serious look at both the Nissan and Infiniti vehicle lines given that my discount would save a few thousand off MSRP and since I was supposed to be given a pre-determined price without any negotiation.  The first time I stopped by to see if the dealer participated in the VPP program and get a quote for the pre-determined VPP price, the sales person said that they didn't participate.  After speaking with the manager on duty though, he agreed that they might be able to quote me the price, and that he'd have the New Car Sales Manager call me the next day to discuss.After hearing back that they would give me the VPP price for the month, I scheduled a time to come in with my wife for a test drive a few days later.  On the day of the test drive, we arrived at the agreed upon time but ended up waiting around a lot and in the end only got to spend 15 minutes with the sales person driving the car and 15 minutes with us driving before they closed.  Since we were still interested in the car, we set up a time to come back the following day to drive further.  Before leaving, when I brought up the topic of price, the sales person started to hedge again whether or not they would honor the VPP price.  By the time we left, we were pretty frustrated given how much time we had wasted, and that they still hadn't told us the price.  This was especially annoying given that I was able to call Sewell Infiniti in Dallas and get a quote on the VPP price in less than 20 minutes over the phone.When we went back the following day, we were given about 45 minutes to drive the car alone because they were having a sales meeting.  This was great, but when we got back to the dealership the shenanigans started again.  First, when I brought up the topic of price the sales person tried to stick a credit application in my face which I complained about vigorously.  Second, the sales person didn't seem to have the answers to any of my questions and kept running off to talk to other people making the discussion very drawn out.  Finally, I blew up and said that if they had any desire to sell me the vehicle today they needed to quote me a price NOW or I was leaving.  After that, things settled down and the experience became tolerable.The bottom line is that if you walk in the door to this dealership without clear expectations and knowing exactly what you want, I could totally see this dealer walking all over you.  It is unfortunate that there is not a second Infiniti dealership in Austin to keep them honest.",2.3
