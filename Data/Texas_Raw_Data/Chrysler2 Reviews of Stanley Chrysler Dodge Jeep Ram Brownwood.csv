0,"April 30, 2020","while I was getting my car serviced here I decided to wait in the sales lounge which was very nice and clean inside and cool. I felt welcomed right away. I had a question about getting tint for my windows which was answered very well even though they do not offer that service. After sitting down I was offered a bottle of water which was very cold! I will definitely be back to this dealership
