0,"February 12, 2020","Noticed an oil smell from my truck.  Took it to Chastang because it's close to my job.  Made an appointment and dropped it off on 2/6/20 Thursday.  Got an estimate on the Monday 2/10/20.  Each day, I had to call to get an update and was told they were waiting on some other department and ended the conversation with maybe tomorrow.  I actually got more information from a different service technician ""Chad"" on Saturday 2/8/20 with a quick summary of the diagnosis, but no estimate.   Explained my concern about the lack of communication from Jarod and received an estimate late Monday morning.  Yesterday, my call ended with I'll find out if it will be ready today, or tomorrow and let you know.  Of course, no call came!  My most recent call today ended finally with ""this afternoon"".  The only consistent communications I received from Jarod were ""I'm so busy"", ""maybe tomorrow"" and ""I'll let you know.""  I would have rented a vehicle if I had known it would take 6 days and counting to get my repairs started and hopefully completed.  Chastang may be a great dealership to buy a new vehicle or if you are a fleet customer.  For the everyday person that uses their vehicle daily for transportation, don't bother unless you have a rental planned.  ",1.0

2,"December 17, 2019","My third truck from this family owned and operated dealership! The baton has truly been passed and the same qualities of customer service first , attention to detail and no high pressure sales have carried on. Joe , Patrick , Mandy and their staff , Cody , Jessica and Alvin all made this a quick and easy transaction. I will recommend this Ford dealership to both commercial and personal truck buyers who want an honest and fair deal on their new purchase. Keep up the good work ladies and gentlemen!! Ford should be proud to call you one of their dealers.",5.0

They are always accommodative and generally get me right in.  the desk personnel and techs are quite proficient and sensitive to the fact that I am waiting for my vehicle.  the waiting area is clean and inviting, as well.",5.0
6,"January 16, 2019","We just finalized our truck purchase on 1/15/19. I have to say it was a very pleasant buying experience. We are from Pennsylvania so ours was a little more complicated getting all the paperwork in place. We worked with one of their newer sales guys David Schlothau. He did a great job, we used an outside credit union for financing which Chastang was happy to allow us that option. They didn't pressure us to use their financing and were not pushy in their sales tactics or for purchasing an extended warranty. I have to say that was so refreshing. They informed us of our options so we could make the best choice for us. We made an appointment to see our truck, they met us and took a test drive then immediately started paperwork. They made it so easy. They were so patient waiting for our financing check to arrive and were great with all the follow-up things we needed. They went above and beyond by working with a local person to get our fifth wheel set up installed as well. The whole experience was top notch. When we picked up our truck it was detailed and the gas tank filled which was an added bonus! David even shared some great local information about rodeo's and local hot spots to check out during our stay. Thanks for making this such a positive experience. We are excited to start using our new to us truck for more of our travels. If you are looking for a truck, I highly recommend them.",4.8

18,"January 05, 2018","Other than my engine light on when I picked up the truck, my  check coolant light on when I picked up the truck. 350$ to unpinch a speaker wire, my 4 wheel drive not diagnosed after 2 weeks and still broken blue tooth after two weeks. and a 700$ rental car bill. Not sure what else could have made the experience worse with y’all. I understand it’s the holidays but when I tell other dealers about this they don’t even know what to say. So I can honestly say. I loved nothing about my experience at Chastang Ford. ",1.8

They have a huge selection of trucks on site, but if you want a specific truck they don't have, they will find it quickly. Ed is great, he's good at his job and makes buying trucks extremely quick and easy. ",5.0
21,"October 13, 2017","We have three vehicles all bought in October 2015. In part as preventative maintenance I replace tires and batteries every two years - about every 50,000 miles for us. Pleasantly surprising was the fact that Chastang's Fast Lane came in as the fastest and most economical dealership providing the service. We set an appointment and specified tires that needed to be ordered and they were there when we arrived and everything was accomplished quickly and, just as importantly, the service department did not give us a laundry list of squirrely  recommended repairs. The honesty is appreciated as much as the good service!",5.0

24,"May 31, 2017","Purchased my F-150 from Chastang. Best buying experience I have had. I worked with Brent, Cody and Chris. All three were very professional while treating me like an old friend. There was no hassle and no pressure. I expected to spend all day haggling over a purchase, instead, I was home for lunch after buying a new truck, trading in my old car  and purchasing  an extended warranty. I highly recommend 
Chastang Ford, I saw a great place to do Business in a highly Professional but Low Keyed setting.

There was no pressure and my sales person Art was fantastic, we worked with Cody who help find the vehicle of my choice and he was absolutely amazing then I had the opportunity to obtain assistance from Randy who was absolutely wonderful. We have never had a car buying experience to go as smoothly as I had with this purchase. We know now what it feels like to be a part of the Chastang family. You are the best. Thomas and Verna",5.0
30,"January 24, 2017",I recently purchased 2017 F-150 Platinum for my favorite dealer and service center.  I found  an internet price lower than should have been posted and Art Flores still honored that price when I came in.  He also set up my phone to sync with my new truck and provide information on all the new features.  Everyone treats me great the moment I walk in the door.  This is should be first and only place to go to shop for that new Ford.,5.0

Finding Chastang Ford through a Google search as an excellent rated dealership and having never heard of the dealership caught my attention.

32,"December 22, 2016",Purchased a truck from Justin Norris at this dealership. He was very helpful and responsive when I had questions. The whole team at Chastang Ford was great. Would definitely recommend them to other people looking to purchase a vehicle,5.0
33,"October 08, 2016","The worst car buying experience ever. They sold me the car and I paid in full for it. However, they screwed up the paperwork and backed out from the sale.  Now I have been waiting for over two weeks to get my money back and dealer basically ignores my phone calls and never returns them. I am going to call police and file report very soon if I don't get my money back. And the worst part is that new car sales manager Randy said that he spoke to mr Chastang, the owner of the place, and he said literally I am quoting "" mr Chastang doesn't want to deal with this sh*t "".  Please stay away from this dealership. ",1.0

35,"November 09, 2015",I  have bought a lot of cars in 40 years but this was by far the best experience I have ever had. Found the vehicle through autotrader knew exactly what I was looking for when I went in. Cody was our salesman we had cash and would have been in and out in minutes but had to much fun talking with the staff.  What a great bunch of people. Made our experience quick and easy. I will be back and highly recommend them to anyone who want to deal with a really honest bunch of folks.,5.0

37,"September 21, 2015","After 5 days of dealing with other dealers in are area, we contacted Chastang Ford before they opened for business and received a call from Stephen. Within a few hours this deal was done! Drove to Houston and met Stephen and the cargo van was exactly what he said it was. Went to the finance department and met Randy who had everything in order and ready to sign. What a great experience!
We will brag about this dealership and the two men who were true to their word. A class act!!!

39,"June 15, 2015","Brent Rice delivered with the shortest and easiest transaction and best deal ever.  The truck was just as he described including being a good deal.  We traded in my old truck and received a fair price.  Thank you, Jesse.  The finance transaction was fair, short and sweet.  Thank you, Randy.  We have never spent as little of time in a dealership buying a vehicle as we did at Chantang Ford and were very satisfied.  Thank you, Brent.

40,"May 19, 2015","I selected this dealer by going out for quotes on a new Transit van to ten different dealers across two states.
Chastang Ford offered me a fair price and more importantly offered a most professional buying experience on the ordering of a custom vehicle. 
There were numerous problems with Ford Motor Co. throughout the ordering process and the Chastang salesman stayed on top of things and kept me apprised the entire time. 

I can not imagine how my buying experience could have been improved.

NOTE: I cannot rate the customer service nor the quality of work (below) because I have not had that experience as yet. However, I fully expect a good experience based on observations.",5.0

42,"January 07, 2015","Looking for a new 2015 F150 Platinum.  Chastang had the truck I was looking for.  Cody Delaney responded to my email request.  Cody was not available and referred me to Jesse Alverez and then Jesse introduced me to Ed Miller.  Ed was very accommodating and answered my questions, showed me the vehicle I wanted.  From then on the experience at Chastang was easy and effortless.  Everything they promised happened as they said it would and today I proudly drove my new truck from the lot.  Even dealing with Randy in finance was a pleasant experience. Would recommend that anyone looking for a vehicle contact Chastang.  They will be pleased with the experience and the attention to you as a customer.",5.0
43,"December 31, 2014","Brian Hinkle and the crew over at Chastang Ford did a great job on the last two F150 Fleet Trucks we purchased.

44,"December 30, 2014","i was highly impressed with Chastang Ford and Brian Hinkle.  needed a 4 wheel drive truck to replace my 2 wheel drive one.  looked at new trucks, but decided to wait for a good used one.  Turned out they had the perfect vehicle on the lot.  had a small issue with the truck bed cover after purchase, but it was resolved quickly and efficiently!  and i feel i got a fair value in trade for my 2 wheel drive truck (that i'd had since new and put 125,000 miles on! )  I recommend them for anyone looking to buy a truck.

45,"December 30, 2014","Top Level Dealership, everyone was ready to help and answer questions.  When it came to different trim levels and options, they were the experts!  We could not be happier.

They had a pristine low mile 2014 F150 pre-owned.  They had to do a bit of hunting to get the factory code for keyless entry, only took minutes and follow through was great.

46,"August 26, 2014","Please allow me to commend Ed Miller on his exceptional customer service skills and follow-up.  I met Ed at a Culligan convention a few years back and since that time I have bought 3 vans from him.  Each time he has helped me with the sizing and specifications to help me make the most informed buying decision.  While it is a bit more difficult to buy vans from a dealer in Houston and arrange to get them to my locations in the Mid-Atlantic, Ed's service and the exceptional pricing has made it worthwhile.  Thanks!",5.0
47,"July 11, 2014","Certified Sales Consultant Cody Delaney was courteous, professional, and very considerate of my limited time in which to complete purchase.

These gentlemen are professional and service oriented.  I have been a fan of Chastang Ford for several years as this dealership specializes in trucks.

51,"March 04, 2014","I was working in Stillwater Oklahoma, but I live in Louisiana. I needed a new F-250 and since my commute back home was nearly 1000 miles, I decided to get prices from Tulsa to Oklahoma City, Dallas to Houston, Lake Charles to Baton Rouge.... Needless to say, I had quite a few quotes come back and the best deal I found was at Chastang Ford in Houston. I was contacted by David Ross, via email as requested, and he worked with me and did what I asked, going as far as doing a thorough body walk around and taking pictures of the engine bay since I was not going to be able to view it in person being in Oklahoma... Always polite and very professional, I highly recommend him as an individual and a sales consultant. Since I was still in Stillwater at the time of purchase, I had to do all my paperwork over the internet and through the mail, but these were obstacles that were easily overcome by the staff at Chastang. A smoother transaction, I've never had any... I was not pressured by David one bit and when I asked a question, I received a straight and prompt answer... When my wife finally got to bring me my truck, it was as described and in great mechanical condition as promised! Finding a dealership that you can trust can be nearly impossible, but I know that my consultant, David Ross, has the integrity that all pre-owned vehicle seekers desire. -Gerald Eckard",5.0
