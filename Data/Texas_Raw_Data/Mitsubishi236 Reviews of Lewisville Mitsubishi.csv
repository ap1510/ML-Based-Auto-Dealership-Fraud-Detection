19,"July 23, 2019","Gerardo is the man to work with, he was extremely helpful during the whole process!
I live in CA and was looking to buy one of their trucks. Gerardo and I discussed everything via phone and email, he made the process ultra easy. He was very accommodating and allowed me to have a 3rd party inspector come in and have the vehicle inspected. Even after the deal was done, he had the bumper professionally repainted (there were a few scrapes), replaced a wheel bearing and threw in some more substantial extra goodies! 
I flew in to drive the vehicle home (although they also offer shipping) , the dealership was modern and looked great, did some extra paper work and was out within 45min.
Overall, the experience was great, only thing I didnt like was they added ""exterior/interior protection package"" on top of the negotiated price. However I was able to get them to honor the original price we agreed to.

25,"April 15, 2019","The first time I went into Lewisville Mitsubishi, I thought it'd be just like any other dealership and an experience filled with frustration. My first experience was with Mike Rice, a sales agent. Mr. Rice listened to what I had to say about both my credit, how much I had to work with and what I was attempting to accomplish. Mr. Rice was so knowledgeable about the product and both he and the Finance department worked to get me into the best vehicle possible with the best payment plan possible. They were even able to work with some of my limitations. But I rolled out of the dealership with a brand new 2019 Mirage G4. I could not ask for a better car, it fits my needs, get's great gas mileage and looks great and works for rebuilding my credit which was my goal in the first place. So I have a wonderful reliable car because of Mr. Rice and his willingness to listen and work with me. These are the best qualities to have in a sales agent. 

During the process of my first encounter with Mr. Rice, my Mother happened to be with me. She told Mr. Rice that she had a Saturn Vue. Mr. Rice told us at that time that the dealership also dealt with GM parts and that the Saturn Vue used those parts. A few days ago, my Mother's car broke down and the starter went out. Remembering what Mr. Rice had said to us when I bought my car, I went to the parts department. I was able to get an estimate from Mr. Cruz along with some helpful advice. The dealership even allowed the car to be towed to the location and stored temporary as they had room. A big thanks to Rachil Ellison for that.  

The agents and people here all listen to what you have to say and work with you to accomplish your goal. This dealership has my utmost loyalty. I can't say enough good things and how kind they were each time I've gone in. If you want to buy a car, come here, if you need a car repair, come here. Talk to them, they will help you find good solutions to your issues.

26,"March 20, 2019","Smooth transaction for the purchase of our brand-new hybrid SUV.  
Alec took great care of us and made sure the car was ready to go when we arrived for our purchase.  We appreciated the way Alec was no-pressure and no-hassle.  We met him first at the Hurst location and he was very knowledgeable about the vehicle and gave us a lot of information. We were just doing research, and he was genuinely no pressure at all.  Later when we decided we wanted to purchase the vehicle, we went back to this salesperson because we appreciated the way he had previously interacted with us.  
After the purchase we needed help with some additional paperwork, and Alec and Nick both graciously assisted us by providing the necessary documents.  
Both Alec and Nick were great to work with!

29,"January 02, 2019","
Hope I could give a zero star. Made a deal with them through email, drove my car to make the trade in. Took a total 18 hrs round way driving to the dealership from another state,  found out the promised car has serious issue. I was willing to see if any other cars in their lot that I am interested in, and possibly we could make the deal from one of those. The sales person was not helpful, and they seem not interested, they don't even let me negotiate for the price, and put some extra charge on that. They only wanna sell me the problem car.  Wasted $200 on the gas and put 1300 miles on my car. Don't waste your time and money if you are driving from another state or city. Don't trust them before you actually see the car.

Like any used car it had a couple of things to be addressed and Frank Retana passed that test with flying colors. Nick Halovanic did the financeing and again  a great job. No hard pressure sale from either guy. Nick got me very good rates and said if I was interested in an extended warrenty they had good terms for that too. Thet were great and I bought one.

45,"May 17, 2018","I just completed the purchase of my first vehicle since I moved to Texas 2 years ago.  I have purchased around 10 vehicles in my life, and I'm not exaggerating when I say this was the best buying experience I have ever had.  Why was it so good?  Because my sales person Gerardo didn't seem like salesmen at all!  There was no relentless push to make something happen on the spot, and no grilling you about how much you can afford as a payment (as if that should be only consideration behind what the right vehicle is for you).  Instead, it felt more like a friend telling you about something they are knowledgeable and passionate about.  He showed me around the vehicle I was interested in, answered all my questions honestly, took me for a test ride, and then offered to let me take it home so my wife could check it out for a day or two and make sure it was what we were looking for.  Wow, great concept ... not having to decide on a large purchase that you want to last years after just a 30 minute tour!  Gerardo and the staff at Lewisville Mitsubishi have this figured out ... when you sell a great product, it will sell itself and you can just be the tour guide!  To top it off, the financing team had the same pleasant demeanor ... I have never signed the documents to pick up a car that quickly before!  Usually there is 2 hours of trying to get you to buy additional services and warranties, but not here ... this was smooth and low pressure, getting me on the road in my new Mitsubishi in record time!  Hate the car buying experience?  I promise you this will feel different ... go to Lewisville Mitsubishi, and ask for Gerardo!

54,"April 14, 2018","David Aguirre is the best,  we recently bout our second car from here.  We went back because of the massive selection of just about anything you could think of when it comes to nice cars.  We live about three hours from Lewisville, it's not that far to drive to get this kind of selection and personal service. We stopped in a few months prior to buying just to look around and get a feel for what our trade was worth.  I had spent a large amount of money on upgrades to the car we were trading.  I tried the dealerships closer to home only to get roughly the same trade value everywhere I went which was whole sale at best without accounting for the 12k we spent on extra stuff.  I really appreciated them allowing something for the extra equipment we had added to the car. They were more than fair on the trade and didn't hit me with full retail n the car we bought trying to play numbers games. I think it is extremely rare these days to find a dealership that just shoots straight without the games. David took the time to listen to what we were looking for and made suggestions based on what we wanted without making us feel  pressured at all.  I would certainly recommend anyone looking for a vehicle to at least give them a shot .  You won't be disappointed .",5.0

76,"April 20, 2017","I visited this dealer, they were rude, unprofessional. So I left, this gave me an opportunity do further research. What I found is this dealer buys new F250s puts a $5000 lift kit on it and sells it for 15,000 over sticker.  So I asked myself why would I go to a Mitsubishi dealer and overpay and be the second owner of the vehicle.  I went to a ford store got $5000 off sticker then I went to a place who does lift kits, they do most of the lifts kits for the fords stores in DFW. I just don't want any issues when I take my truck for warranty work. And I'm the 1st owner so when I sell the truck it's  a 1 owner vehicle. Very disappointed in Lewisville Mitsubishi.

84,"December 17, 2016","I was contemplating trading in my 2014 Outlander for a 2016-2017 model due to the rebates being offered by Mitsubishi & dealers.  I contacted two dealerships and received a reply from Lewisville Mitsubishi right away.  I was able to work the entire purchase and trade in through email as I travel quite extensively for work.  Both the Salesman, Kyle Woodcock and Sales Manager John Mahaffey responded very quickly to my emails and answered any questions I had.  Both even came in early on a Saturday before the dealership opened to accommodate my hectic schedule so that I could sign the papers and drive off in my new 2016 Outlander SEL.  I've purchased well over 20 cars in my lifetime, and this was one of the smoothest transactions I've experienced.  I would definitely recommend contacting Lewisville Mitsubishi if you're in the market for a new Mitsubishi. ",5.0

91,"September 29, 2016",Buying a car is usually one of the worst experiences of ones life. All the haggling and all the intimidating    looks and jesters . We have been needing a car for several years but the years of purchasing experience has left us very gun shy and we would actually rather use an online purchasing service than deal with a dealership. We went in only to pick up a brochure and if we could have gotten one on line would have done so. We were very pleased with this dealership. They were nice and we didn't feel pressured into doing something we didn't want to do.We were very happy and totally surprised with this purchase and must say something has changed with the car buying experience we didn't feel exploited or scammed as we have in the past. Only negative is it still in the method of leaving the  purchasers in the room alone to go speak with the sales manager come on guys you know what you can match because it is now on the web.,5.0

And we worked with Ralph in the finance department and he didn't put pressure on us with a lot of extras.

97,"August 22, 2016",My husband and I went in after deciding to trade in my vehicle for a newer car.  We had found a car that was in our price range and brought the paperwork we had found for it on-line.  They had no problem letting me test drive the Outlander Sport.  While we test drove they evaluated my trade.  We returned back to start the negotiations...This is the part I was personally dreading.  I must say it went much more smoothly than I had expected.  They came to me with my trade value and the car price and laid out their offer.  We told them what we wanted to pay out the door.  Gerardo took that price to his GM and when he came out he gave me a second offer.  We stood pretty firm.  The GM came out and in less then 30 minutes we had a new car at a very fair price.  Gerardo did a excellent job of conveying our needs to the management and we were able to come to a deal very quickly with no pressure or headache.   ,5.0

He was very thorough and showed many different styles that might fit what I wanted.  He even showed me a '15 that would have been very budget friendly.  He was not pushy, just very informative.  Ryan worked everything sothat it would fit into the budget that I needed. I now have exactly the car that I want and feel like I was treated courteously and fairly.",5.0

My husband bought his first Lancer back in 2008 and had a wonderful experience with the dealership ... when looking to trade in for a brand new model - we called them and told them exactly what we were looking for. We live over 45 minutes away from this dealership and explained our situation - Told Michael what we wanted, what price range, and that we had been BS'd too many times to drive all the way out there to play games - Michael did all the leg work and got us exactly what we wanted. He had us in and out of there within an hour and we drove off with the car we wanted. Very knowledgeable, nice and professional! ",4.8

From the friendliness, willingness to help get me where I needed to be, I knew within the first 15 minutes I'd be driving home with another new car from this location.  I'll recommend everyone I know here.  I encountered a few other employees, who also were smiling, up beat, engaging and great senses of humor (which I find extremely important in service).

Today, I ended up buying the larger Outlander and am so glad I gave my business to Lewisville Mitsubishi. My father and I had visited quite a few dealerships and test drive lots of cars, but this dealership had the most follow through and professionalism compared to even the ""high end dealerships."" We really enjoyed working with Ryan Miller and Michael Simmons. Even after I was sold, Michael Simmons was quite knowledgeable and took his time explaining all the features and benefits of my new car which I greatly appreciated.

Michael, extremely knowledgeable about the Outlander and a owner of one himself, understood what I needed and did not disappoint.  We close the deal within a reasonable amount of time.  It was truly a pleasure to work with Michael. I give him a Grade A+ for professionalism and customer service. For this reason, I highly recommend Michael if you are considering purchasing a Mitsubishi vehicle.  Also, major kudos for the dealership for employing such high quality associates.

164,"June 21, 2015",Called on a truck off there used lot was told it was clean inside and out and given a vary thorough inspection. I took the 280 mile trip to find a dented scratched truck that also featured stains on the interior and that was in bad need of an alignment. After working out what was still a great deal I drove off the lot to have one of the TPS senors quit. I quickly pulled back into the lot after 30 mins or so they told me they would run the truck down and get it fixed. I waited 20 more mins before I asked why the truck hasn't moved they told me to go ahead and I could take it. Get over that obstacle and go to pick up a trailer to use to tow my car home and the trailer light plug is dead. Go back to the dealership they spend 40 mins trouble shooting. They get a tester to show that they are working now so I go back to pick up the trailer to find them again not working. Call again but this time my salesman is unreachable(10 + calls to his cell and there land line) get back to the lot and no one can find him or reach him on his phone. So I just returned the truck and now have wasted 300+ dollars on this trip. ,2.6

167,"May 26, 2015",If your out looking for a new car this is the place to come.  Staff is very friendly and looking to make sure comfortable while waiting for the paperwork process.  I have had a Mitsubishi Outlander before and really love the car and now purchasing a new one.,4.8
168,"May 21, 2015","I have had my fair share of dealership experiences (and I'm not even 30!) and I hate the way salesmen treat you. I had high hopes for this dealership though after reading 66 reviews on this site alone and only 2 (that's right, TWO) of them were 2 stars. ALL the rest were 5! That was new to me, I'm used to reading every other review being a negative. So I was definitely impressed!  

So here's where my story begins. I've been shopping for a car for about a week and been to 2 other dealerships with no success ( no call backs, the usual back and forth game, high down payments, etc). Mind you my credit isn't good but no one seemed to want to work with me. Yesterday  morning (5/12/15) I was watching TV with my son about to go to work, when I got a call from Lewisville Mitsubishi out of the blue. Justin was the person on the call, saying he pulled my application from somewhere online and that I was pre-approved for a vehicle, was I still in need of one? Yes I was but was skeptical he could get anything done. He said he could work some things for me and he'd call me back. About 15 minutes later he called back saying I was approved for a loan on a 2015 Mitsubishi Mirage, when could I come in? Still being skeptical I asked him about the numbers. The monthly payments were actually really good but the deposit was what I was concerned with. He said he could work with me on it and to come in, but I had to work until 730 in the evening and they close at 8. He said that wasn't a problem and to just head over after work. All throughout the afternoon I kept emailing him voicing my worries and concerns he couldn't actually help me with getting in a car, but he reassured me he could work miracles. I went to their website and found a really cute green Mitsubishi Mirage I really liked and let him know. 730pm rolled around and my fiance, son, and I headed to Mitsubishi Lewisville. We pulled in and there was the very car I mentioned I had liked, pulled up in front. I looked it over, sat in it for 2 seconds, but wanted to go inside and talk numbers.  We went in and 20 minutes later, boom I had a car!!  He was so easy going as was the financing manager we dealt with (I can't remember his name, I think it was Kevin). I told him what I wanted, what I could do, he didn't question me, no back and forth games, and we were out the door in no time flat!  I couldn't be more impressed or excited at the awesome experience I had with this place! The ONLY reason I didn't drive it off the lot last night was because I don't have insurance as of yet. Hoping to be driving my car home tonight!  If you have bad credit, no credit or excellent credit, please PLEASE don't go anywhere else but Lewisville Mitsubishi!  These guys are the best I've EVER delt with!  And my wedding is in 2 days, so they made my week SO much less stressful. I LOVE YOU GUYS!!!",5.0
169,"May 16, 2015","I typically don't write reviews of products I buy. Honestly I only write when I am disappointed in the service or product, and never for a Car Dealer. This was different.  I worked with Michael Simmons for my Outlander purchase. He was patient, No pressure (that is huge), and genuine. I called about a car that was listed, filled out an application on line and when I got there he had the car ready out front  for me to test drive at the same time he had his appraiser check my trade. When I came back from the test drive, my wife and i took 3 minutes to decide this was the car we wanted. Went above and beyond to take care of me and the finance team got me a great rate. I can't say enough good. Never expected this, This was the best buying experience I have had, bottom line.. ",5.0
170,"May 06, 2015","To be honest I wasn't a 100% going to purchase a car that day. I was just going to look and see what my options were.  I am not a big fan of car salesmen because they always seem to be pushy, uptight ""Know-It-Alls"".  They don't listen to you and try to sell you something that you don't want like all the extra add-ons. I have always felt they were more interested in making their commission then customer service.   Not Michael Simmons!!! His friendly and courteous manner was a pleasant surprise.  He gave me the feeling like I was talking to a neighbor not a salesman. He gave me the opportunity to share with him the car I was driving, so that he could better understand what I would want in a new car.  He LISTENED!!!  Once I decided, that yes I would go ahead and purchase a new car, he walked me through the process and it was very painless.  I drove off the lot in a brand new Silver 2015 Mitsubishi Mirage. (now known as the ""Silver Bullet"")  YEAH!!!  But Michael's customer service didn't stop there...On my way home (which was over an hour away) I realized that I had left some important items in my trade-in. I called Michael immediately and he offered to drive them to me the next day, knowing that I had such a far drive.  And that he did. He drove to my work the next day to deliver my items. He even answered a couple of questions I had about the cars functions.  Michael Simmons is a great example of what a car salesman should aspire to be. Thank you Michael Simmons for a great car buying experience.",4.8
171,"April 12, 2015","I loathe going to car dealerships. I don't like the sales tactics, getting swarmed, and having some salesman follow me around the lot like a pilot fish. 

I was blown away this weekend. 
Wife's car needed to be traded in so she went in and picked one out and then sent me in to take care of the purchase. I went in mentally prepared to do battle.

Then I met ""Travis May"". After walking around the lot for a few minutes he greets me at the door and we just talked casually about the cars, features, prices, etc. Never once tried to sell me anything. Never once pushed, urged, me to do anything. He never did the ""I got to talk to my manager"" car salesmen act where the go back and forth.

We started working the numbers and I had flashes of when it comes time to trade in my car in a year or two. This was just so pleasant it seemed worth throwing out""What if I buy 2?""

My wife and I both have 2015 Outlanders and Lewisville Mitsubishi has 2 customers that will be back next time. 

If Travis is there when it is time to trade in these cars, I will ask for him.

I was completely blown away by this whole process form start to finish and I am a fan of this place. 

And this review is coming from a guy that would rather have a root canal than go to a car dealership.

Lewisville Mitsubishi & Travis are light years ahead of other dealerships when it comes to making buying a car painless.

He talked to me and my wife about everything, not all about the car, and while listening to our concerns and needs he came up with a game plan for us showed up some options. He was honest and told us what we did and did not need for what we was looking for. He wasn't trying to up sell us and made it clear what he would do in our situation, which was cool and appreciated. After he did all he could he have the ball to Ricky Clark,the finance manager, who after receiving all our information went to work for us. Ricky is really not a finance manager but a magician of numbers. He helped us get our first car and although getting this car was a shot in the dark, after hitting a few walls and 2 hours later, Ricky once again pulled it off and stay within our requirements. Sean then introduced us to the final member of the big 3 Michael Simmons, who is the guru of the Outlanders. He explained every single little things about the car. Hooked up our phones to the bluetooth, made sure it was presentable for us and a bunch of other things. He talked as if he made the car himself.

202,"May 09, 2014","We were in the market for a new car and after researching on the internet, we decided that the Mitsubishi Outlander Sport SE was our vehicle of choice. I had originally chosen a dealership in Plano to visit but while looking at dealership reviews, I happened upon Lewisville Mitsubishi and their reviews were all positive, which was a great selling point for me. We decided that we would visit Lewisville Mitsubishi to see if we could possibly make a deal there. We drove from Hugo, OK to Lewisville, TX, a little over two hours and had high hopes of a great buying experience.

A young salesman by the name of Michael Simmons approached us in the parking lot. Normally when a salesman approaches me I would be apprehensive and almost guarded, wary of any sales gimmicks that the salesman would try to pull. Michael put that apprehension to rest with his gentle nature and pleasant personality. He showed us several vehicles from the loaded models to the stripped down version. He carefully took note of all of our requests and wants in a new vehicle. He then said that we could go inside and that he would look for the car that had everything we wanted. He drove up a few minutes later with a vehicle that met all of our needs. It was perfect!!

We then went inside to discuss the deal and after we told Michael what we were looking for as far as financing and monthly payment, he brought John Mahaffey in to talk to us. John also had a gentle nature and pleasant personality and worked hard to get us the deal that we wanted. Both Michael and John delivered that day... and we certainly appreciate them for taking the time to make us feel like we were the most important customers that ever entered the dealership. We will absolutely be repeat customers to this dealership!

208,"April 25, 2014",We dislike the experience of buying cars because of the usual back & forth and game playing with the sales people at the dealerships.

211,"April 18, 2014","TL:DR = They're awesome.

I've been to a lot of dealerships, looked at a test driven and looked at a lot of cars, dealt with a lot of sales people and finance managers. I've had the pleasure of doing business with some really nice dealerships, and the stress and headache of wrestling with the opposite, and the businesses that fall in between. So I have a decent amount of experience, and usually when I head to a dealership, I come prepared to get what I want or walk out. 

On Tuesday, April 15th, I got home from work, checked my mail, and got a little advert from Lewisville Mitsubishi. Since I had recently gone through a bankruptcy, these little flyers have been constantly plaguing my mailbox with everyone trying to be the one to get me into a high interest rate car. At first I chuckled a little, since the Mitsubishi advertisement was wanting me to trade in a previous car I no longer owned, but it had also offered a gift card for a test drive, which I already enjoyed doing, so I figured free money was worth a evening of harsh battle with a salesman.

Over the past couple of months I've been hunting for a deal or some sort of setup to get out of my current(now previous) Honda CRV. Not a bad car in it's own right, but one that I hated for various reasons. The major thorn in my plans was the 4,000 dollars I was upside down on it, a shameful result of me getting taken advantage of by a less reputable dealership in the midst of my bankruptcy, when I was over stressed and panicking about my then current car getting repo'd and then having trouble getting to my new job. So I made a rash decision and a shady deal to just get some wheels. I've been regretting the CRV since.

So I've been used to being flat out turned down by dealerships, which is depressing and frustrating, but not nearly as infuriating as being held hostage by a salesmen who insists he can make you a deal that is out of your price range, or so long and so packed with interest, that you feel you should be getting two cars for the price of one.

I was greeted shortly after leaving my car at the Lewisville Mitsubishi lot, looking to test-drive a new Lancer in a manual transmission, slightly saddened by them informing me they didn't actually have any new ones, but they did have a used one. While riding with the Sales consultant, Gerard Panther, we started chatting, like you do. We had an actual conversation, not me listening to some rant about the features or why used might be better than new. I actually got to liking Gerard as a cool, down to earth person who's job just so happened to be at a car dealership. 

All by itself, a awesome sales guy is great, but only makes up a fraction of an overall dealership experience. It wasn't long after my test drive that I met with Ricky Clark, a finance manager, who wanted to run the numbers. I was very up front with Ricky, told him my situation, and the challenges that I've faced before at other dealerships. Ricky's response was practical, and most of all, honest.

I can't stress this enough, the finance manager knew what he had to work with, laid it all out in front of me, and expressed confidence that with the incentives he had available, he could get me into a new 2014 Mirage. My first response was 'Eww' although I politely refrained from expressing it out loud, I wasn't thrilled with a vehicle I had never even heard of before, and what I learned quickly was that it was small, and had a small engine. Ricky offered a test drive while he sent out the requests to the banks, with Gerard once again filling in the role of riding along with me as I tried out another vehicle.

I was far from sold at that point, it was getting late, and although some banks had replied, others had not. Everyone was awesome, some random guy from the service department walking by, obviously on his way to do his own thing, stopped to make sure I was being helped as I sat in a chair waiting for another step. Another manager got me some cupcakes at another point (he had offered a drink, I chose the sugar). While I was hanging around their raised room that overlooked the showroom, chatting about some previous bad experiences with someone who I believe to be the owner, while moving the process along, helping them get my payoff information for the CRV, I still wasn't 100% sold.

Like I said, everyone was great, the car was even growing on me, and the deal, while not incredible due to my credit, was the best I had ever gotten from a dealership while in my position. As if seeing my continued hesitation, Ricky suggested I take the Mirage home for a day, since it was getting late, and drive it for the day, bringing it back tomorrow, making any kind of decision then. 

Nobody was putting any pressure on me at that point, nobody telling me that I'd be missing out if I didn't sign some deal tonight, none of them trying to stress me out with up-sells or constant retreating to their managers to 'get one more offer'. I loved the thought of having the freedom to see if the car fit my life for a day before taking a big leap and actually buying it, and the people at Lewisville Mistubishi understood that.

Yes, I did bring it back the next day, having slept on it, consulted with friends and family, walking back into the dealership with a few requirements that were quickly met without haggle or hassle. I did get a different color one, so after the quick swap, an extra test drive just to make sure I liked driving a blue one instead of a white one, I told them that I wanted to buy the car, because they weren't lurking around me, pestering me to make a decision or constantly asking if I liked it or wanted to buy it. They let their product and their people sell their car, not their sales pitch.

It wasn't until I was going through all the paper work with Ricky that we started talking about our cats and his love of flying, idle chit chat while I waited for them to wash my new bright blue Mirage, but I appreciated it a lot, because it was sincere. They'd already sold me the car, they could of just tossed me back out into the chairs in the showroom floor and let the TV handle my boredom, but they didn't.

I love my new car, and I love my experience at Lewisville Mitsubishi, because, while it was no doubt a trip to another dealership, the staff there was more interested in being friendly and helpful, and that, in my opinion, is what sells cars.

213,"March 22, 2014","Oh My Gosh, where do I start!!  I have not bought a car in 20 years.  Mine finally broke down needed something quick.  I contacted Richard Pugh (friend of my husband), he in turn had Cole Price call us.  I felt overwhelmed until talking to Cole.  I explained my situation to him and explained that I was going to need an SUV because of my husbands disability.  I want you to know that the whole transaction (until I signed the papers) was done via there website.  Cole took my information and submitted it to Finance Manager Ricky Clark for pre approval.  Once we had that, Cole picked out vehicles that were exactly what I asked for, I couldn't have picked it any better myself.  He listened to me and my needs.  He sent me several links for the vehicles.  I picked a 2014 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport ES, in red which was equip perfectly!!!  I got back to Cole to let him know which vehicle and he then put in the care of Alex Oglesby.  Alex, cleaned the car up and DELIVERED it to my home!!  Never imagined the over and above compassion from this staff!!!  They made purchasing my vehicle so pleasant.  I will never ever forget Richard, Cole, Alex and Ricky!!  I will recommend all of my friends and family to go to them first, when they need a vehicle.",5.0
214,"March 16, 2014","Working with the Lewisville Mitshubishi  was a fantastic experience! We were greeted by Michael Simmons when walking onsite and he was beyond friendly and willing to assist any of our needs from the moment he met us. He and his team did whatever it took to get my husband in his dream truck all while providing exceptional customer service along the way. The entire team at Lewisville Mitsubishi are truly wonderful people and they have the best interest for you and your family in mind. I don't think I will consider another dealership to work with when it is time for me to purchase my next vehicle. I would most likely call Micheal Simmons and see if they could find the car I am looking for just to be able to work with him, Ricky in Financing and the entire staff at Lewisville Mitsubishi.

215,"February 14, 2014","Michael Simmons and the new GM went above and beyond!!!  My husband and I showed up close to closing time to look at a new Mitsubishi Outlander and they went out of their way to find what we were looking for and answer my numerous questions.  They were both extremely helpful, friendly, and patient with me!! Never once did I feel uncomfortable, unwelcomed, pressured, or frustrated, which we all know often comes with trying to buy a new car.  They even pulled two cars side by side for me to compare the small details between the two!!  Because the car I chose had been parked under a tree and was dirty on the outside, my salesman and the GM went and personally rolled up their sleeves and washed my car in the back, while we visited with the financial representative, whom was also extremely helpful, friendly, honest, and knowledgeable.  Michael S., the new GM, and our financial representative each stayed 3 hours past closing time to make sure we were completely happy and leaving Texas with the new car we hoped to find.  3 HOURS past closing!! (Evident that they were in no way pressuring and were VERY patient with me!!)  We drove 2 1/2 hours to get here and we would do it again!  

This is by far the best car buying experience I have ever had!!! Thank you guys so much!! We appreciate you and love the car!! Thanks again for everything!!

When we went back to get a new vehicle this time they were very good at figuring out our goal and how to accomplish that goal the best way for us. They helped us figure out almost immediately what we needed to do and sent us down the road to Mitsubishi.

The hardest part was deciding which awesome car I wanted to buy!  I did my research before shopping and was pleasantly surprised that not only did they not insult my intelligence by bogus negotiations but they also gave me an excellent trade in value for my previous car!!

My wife and I and two kids set aside our Saturday afternoon for this express purpose.  He called us 45 minutes before we left to drive to the dealership and asked if 'we were still coming?'  I found this odd and said yes we were, but asked him what was wrong.  He then stated the car we wanted to test drive was not at Lewisville and was not ready for us to test drive.  He would have to go get it in Hurst.  Would we mind waiting around?

My fiance went in to purchase a new car, asking us to jump through hoops every step of the way. Do this, we did, sorry now do this, we did, nope do this now, over and over all the while they were trying to work a deal with the banks. We offered to put a good chunk of change down, but not all at once. We offered to put up half of 5k and the other half with in 7 days. This has been done numerous times in the past and I have done it with every car I have purchased, including the two from this dealership. The owner came back and said that since we were moving out of state and would be out of state at the time the rest of the money was due, they didnt trust us to pay the rest of the 5k. To even insinuate that your customer is going to steal your car blows my mind but to do this to a repeat customer who has purchased vehicles from you in the past is absolutely unacceptable. There are many dealerships who would love to get 5+ grand cash on a car and not insult their customers in the same breath. Will NEVER deal with these guys again, and will warn everyone I come in contact with to do the same.",1.8
229,"August 19, 2011","I purchased a 2004 Lancer from this dealer (in part because of the Tires for Life deal they had).  I had all the recommended services and oil changes done at their service department and felt good knowing they did a 27 point inspection every time I had my oil changed.  Until my last oil change with them.  The very next day I came out to find my tire was flat.  And when putting on my spare I realized that every single tire was bald/had treads showing.  The service department let me drive off the lot with the tires like this.  Angry, I went back to have them change my tires on the tires for life deal, and was told I would have to wait a week for them to get the tires in.  I rely far too much on my vehicle for this to be an option, so I had to take my car elsewhere to have the tires replaced and void the Tires for Life deal.  Fabulous.  I stopped taking my car in for service with this dealer.  Fast forward to yesterday.  My A/C has not been working properly, and the shop I had been taking it to gave me a quote (Compressor needed to be replaced) that was a little too steep for my college expenses.  So I (illogically) decided to try the dealer again.  I gave them the printed quote from my regular shop (which also had their diagnosis on it) and left it with them with the understanding they would call me with their quote.  I receive a call from Oscar 5 hours later saying that, yes, the compressor needed to be replaced and that it would be $850 for generic parts and 6 hours of labor and, by the way, my suspension looks like it needs to be fixed and its $250 for each arm.  I nix the suspension for the time being, and since the A/C quote was the same as my regular shop was quoting I told them to go ahead.  24 hours later they call to tell me my car is ready to pick up.  When I go to pay the cashier tells me my total is $1650.  Turns out Oscar failed to mention that the $850 dollars he was quoting me over the phone DID NOT INCLUDE LABOR.  Kevin, the service manager tries to make things better by removing the total for the rags, washers, etc. that they charge.  I appreciated the gesture, as it dropped my total down to %1500.29, but it is still almost double the max price I was willing to pay.  With little else to do, I paid up.  I had to unregister for my classes this semester.  Thank you Lewisville Mistubishi for pushing back my date of graduation by 6 months!",1.8

This is the second vehicle that we have purchased from them, and as far as we are concerned, we will only purchase from them. I am constantly amazed at how this dealership has made it their number 1 priority to make sure that we are completely satisfied. Not only that, but they have made it a top priority to make sure that we feel welcome each and every time we step on the property. Our salesman, Shelby, has got to be, hands down, the finest sales person we have ever dealt with, for any product. He surpasses any other. He remembers the details, he pays attention, and he appreciates the hows and the whys. He does not try to force a sale, and he does not try to push. Instead, he EARNS your business and your respect. We are completely in awe of this.
Lewisville Mitsubishi made every effort to give us a great deal on our new Outlander, an excellent deal on our trade-in, and they went above and beyond to get us the top end financing. When our new license plates came in, Shelby met me at the door of the dealership, and he put the plates on the car himself. Again, above and beyond. As if they have not done enough, we received a phone call today, from Richard at Lewisville Mitsubishi, and the content of the call was to let us know that apparently during one of our test drives, I had lost a ring in the car (it was in my pocket). The ring was inscribed on the inside, and Richard went through the invoices of the sold vehicles until he found the names (mine and my husband's) that matched the inscription. I was not sure where I had lost the ring, so I had not thought to call the dealership, but I stand completely grateful and amazed. So to Shelby, to Richard, to John in finance, what a great group of people. 
I would encourage ANYONE and EVERYONE looking to buy a car, used or new, to go to Lewisville Mitsubishi. This is the finest dealership you will ever go to, and I believe the most wonderful experience you will have investing in your future.",5.0
