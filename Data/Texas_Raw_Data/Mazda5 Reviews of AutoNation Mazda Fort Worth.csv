0,"July 15, 2019","I own a 2008 Miata MX5. I try to keep the servicing up to date. I had to find a better place after several bad experiences with the Hiley dealerships (crappy customer service, promises made and not kept). The last straw was that my car was in for 6 days. They said they were waiting on a part - understandable. On day 6, I dropped by (because nobody answered the phone) to find that the part never got ordered. Enough!
My brother told me about this place. An entirely different experience! Fix took 2 days, at about the same price as the dealership quoted. Customer service was great and the place isn't on the edge of town!
Don't travel farther for bad service. Use these guys. Hiley doesn't deserve your business.",4.8
1,"September 15, 2017","Let me just start by saying that I absolutely dread the new car shopping/buying process but I can honestly say (and I don't say things I don't mean) working with William Ramirez was about the easiest process that I could have imagined. We began conversing through email (never hassled to call me) and he listened to what I said I wanted in a vehicle and he very quickly responded by offering several vehicles to review. I started the process on a Monday or Tuesday and ended up going into the dealership Friday morning at 9am. From the first meeting, William was very knowledgable about the car and took the time to answer all of our questions. We test drove, talked through what I was looking for in a vehicle, the price, my trade-in, etc and we were off to the races. I had already gotten a estimate from Carmax on my trade in plus worked with my credit union to secure financing so I was ready! I told him what I was looking to pay and why. After a few hours, we were the new owners of a 2017 Mazda CX-5 Grand Touring with the Premium Package UNDER what I wanted to pay! I couldn't be more pleased with this transaction and I highly recommend William Ramirez to anyone that is looking to purchase a new Mazda or Ford. He wasn't pushy and I never got the feeling that he was not listening to my requests. Awesome salesman, wish all of my dealings were as pleasant as this one. Kudos AutoNation, William is a keeper!",4.8

Zack explained all of the financial aspects and offered excellent advice on fitting the new expenses into my budget. I will tell anyone looking for a new or pre-owned vehicle that this dealership will listen to your needs and deliver more in a courteous and ethical manner. THANK YOU ARLENE!!!",5.0
3,"October 24, 2016","My husband and I went to Fort Worth Mazda to look at an SUV. From the moment we hit the lot to the moment we drove off the lot was a great experience- which is something I've never had happen before when buying a car. Our salesman, Forrest, was 100% helpful and worked with us keeping what we wanted in mind the entire time without being pushy. He was highly knowledgeable and very patient. Once we hit the finance office, our financial guy was easy to work with and he explained everything to our understanding. Everyone we made contact with in the Mazda dealership was so friendly and I would go back just to talk and hang out since I felt like we built an actual relationship with this team. Mazda Fort Worth is the only dealership I'll go to from now on for thr excellent customer service.",5.0
4,"July 23, 2016","Having been a Mazda owner for 8 years I was looking to purchase another Mazda. I called and spoke with the manager and they happen to have the exact car I was looking from interior to exterior. The next day I went to the dealership and met our salesman, Forrest. He was very polite and extremely knowledgeable about the new Mazda CX-9's. Everything was easy from the test drive to signing the papers. The other salesmen were even very accommodating and friendly during our little wait time. I'm very impressed with Autonation Mazda of Fort Worth and am happy of my decision to purchase a vehicle there. The only negative I have is that they didn't come off the sticker price of the vehicle like I was hoping, but I think we all hope they will come off the sticker more. ",5.0
