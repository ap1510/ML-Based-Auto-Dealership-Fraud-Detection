0,"April 24, 2020","I recently had a very good experience car shopping with the ed hicks dealership.  Specifically, CF Ebelt was a wonderful representative and coordinator for my shopping.  I went through a long process and he was there at every step to answer my questions honestly and guide me the right direction.  He was honest and forthright and I never felt pushed or deceived.

The dealership in general was helpful in every step of a previous purchase and in my recent experiences.  I would go back there in a second and particularly deal with CF.

1,"April 12, 2020",In my 60+ years of buying vshicles--CF was the best I've worked with.  A real asset to your dealership.  The fact I  didn't have to leave my property during this time of crisis was a real plus.,4.2
2,"February 25, 2020","CF was excellent to work with.  He was professional, courteous and creative in helping me with my trade-in and new vehicle purchase.  Heâ€™s not a pushy salesman, and listens to your needs.  I would recommend CF if you are interested in buying a Mercedes.  ",5.0
3,"February 19, 2020","It's bad enough to have to pay $349.44 for a B service  (oil, filter. change brake fluid) then good old Ed Hicks has to stick it to you with $6.00 windshield washer fluid and $71.60 wiper blade replacement charges. How does a dealer justify $71.60 for wiper blades and replacement on top of a $250.00 B service  labor charge ??",2.0
4,"December 17, 2019","CF was amazing to work with.  He listened to what I wanted and made it happen.  There was never any pressure to make a purchase.

7,"June 07, 2019","By far, the best experience Iâ€™ve had purchasing a vehicle. Every department will treat the purchase as if they were the ones purchasing the vehicle and will give you all the information you will need. However, One of the best part of the experience was my salesman C.F Ebelt. He made me feel like I was part of his family. He ensured that I not only picked my vehicle based on looks and my budget but also the one with the most safety features since I have young children. In addition, he was able to ensured I stayed within my budget and didnâ€™t pressure me to look outside that. Prior to me leaving the dealership, he helped me completed all my vehicles settings such as apple car play and Bluetooth. After leaving he followed up with a text to not hesitate to reach out to him if I need help with anything regarding my new vehicle. Which, reassured me that I had made the right purchase from the right person. Once again, thank you C.F. ðŸ˜Š",5.0
8,"March 25, 2019","My experience with Ed Hicks was a very pleasant one. Upon arriving I was greeted courteously. Sales person Mason Gist allowed time for me to really weigh my options without being pushy. We even went for a second test drive where I requested a bumpy road and he knew just where to take us. Mason was also very straight forward about answering my questions about the vehicle itself as well as the finance part. His patience throughout the entire sale helped to not have the feeling of a pushy salesman.  One concern I had was the cleanliness of the vehicle since I did purchase a used one so Mason took it upon himself to speak for me with Art, the detailing guy at Ed Hicks to remind him a few times of what I the customer was expecting. As far as the paper work is concerned it was fairly easy as well. P. Mathisen showed her professionalism throughout my time there.  My experience with Ed Hicks and staff was awesome and their facilitiy was clean and well organized . I wish sales men were more like Mason Gist.  Not pushy and caring.",5.0
9,"December 16, 2018",I felt no pressure to purchase a vehicle right then and there.

17,"April 03, 2018",This has been the easiest experience in purchasing a vehicle.there was never any pressure from the sale person( CF Ebelt ). On the contrary C F was very instrumental in helping us make that final decision of  purchasing the  the SUV  after driving a sedan all these years.  Especially in making the decision between the GLA and the GLC  by allowing us to test drive the two several times  as well as explaining the features between the two.  The greatest PLUS for CF was the challenge we placed on him in locating the  color and the safety package  Dorothy requested. CF hit  a HOME RUN for us.  Thanks to the Hicks Family for having   such a great professional sales person on your team.Dorothy and  Henry,5.0

76,"October 02, 2012","My ML350 stalled today. Reason was a defective crank shaft sensor, which I was able to diagnose myself. After some cooling down of the engine, I was able to start up and drive to Ed Hicks Imports. They had the sensor. When I asked whether they could exchange it for me, since I wasn't able to get home, I was told that the shop was full and it might be possible to repair it the next day - maybe!
So I drove home with a total of three stops to let it cool down, so the engine starts up again. At home I replaced the part myself. It took me a total of 15 minutes including getting the tools and to clean up!
What a wonderful service of Ed Hicks - a repair for a stranded costumer declined - for your guys it would have taken about 10 minutes and I would have been happy. Shame on you! This was the second negative experience with you - so never again! 
I recommend for every Mercedes owner not to use their services!",1.7
