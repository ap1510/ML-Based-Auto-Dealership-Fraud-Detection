0,"February 10, 2014","At this point, I've only come in for scheduled maintenance. People are friendly. On one occasion, the shuttle driver took me home. Another time, i was given a rental so that I could get to work. They are always clear on maintenance recommendations and prices and I don't have to wait long to get an appointment.",4.0
