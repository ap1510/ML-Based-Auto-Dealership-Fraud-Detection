2,"January 06, 2020","Found a 2019 used Avalon on line described as just what I wanted.  Visited the dealership and found the car as advertised.  The salesman was pleasant but not very knowledgeable of the car's features.  I arranged to pay cash and pickup the car on Friday, December 27th.  Due to holiday schedules (Christmas on Wednesday), I couldn't get funds into my checking account until Friday.  I offered a $500 deposit to hold the car but was assured no deposit was needed and the car would be ready Friday.    I arrived at the dealership at 9:30 AM Friday morning and found that paperwork was being finalized at that very minute selling the car to another customer.  An insincere apology was offered, but I will not again get involved with a Mike Calvert Dealership.",2.6

4,"July 27, 2019","I came in to Mike Calvert Toyota to buy a used 2019 Toyota Corolla that I saw online. I asked about the condition of the car and was told that the car was a trade-in by a rich kid who changed his mind about the car after a few months. The car was in pretty good condition, but had a few stains and scratches here and there, of which they told me could easily be taken out. I specifically asked if the car had ever been in an accident and they said “no way”. AFTER I put my downpayment down they told me they could no longer take them out. I was in a rush to get a car, so I put that aside and continued the purchasing process. After everything was finalized I took my car to a friend of mine and he ran his hand across the car and right away he said that this car had been in an accident, and not only that but that it was a terrible paint job and that’s how I could tell. He went ahead and looked up the VIN and lo and behold it had been in an accident and was actually received from the auction, so their little trade in story was a lie.

I went back to the dealer and the manager told me it was MY fault, because everyone who buys a used car signs a CarFax. I said regardless they should have been honest when I verbally asked, but they just continued saying it didn’t matter because the CarFax was signed. I did not recall signing a CarFax, so I asked to see it and that’s when they told me they ""accidentally"" forgot to present it with me. During this time, the general manager, Mike Grewenig, came out and instead of making the situation better he justified and defended what was going on. At one point he even rolled his eyes at me. Imagine a 60 year old man rolling his eyes at a 22 year old girl who just got cheated to and lied to by his employees. He then told me he was offering me to return the car and no other dealer in Texas would allow that.. That was another lie.. They are required to do so by law since not disclosing an accident is considered dealer fraud.

Nonetheless, I ended up keeping the car, because I was moving soon and out of a car, and didn’t have time to spend another 4 days car shopping and going through the closing process. 

This happened about a month ago, and what motivated me to write a review was the fact that someone recently had a similar experience. The manager repeatedly told me this was an accident and that he would assure it would never happen again, but here it is happening again. This dealership needs to be shut down or at least barred from used car sales. All the bad reviews come from there.. The only reason they have any good reviews are because of their new car sales. You can't really scam someone with a new car, but look at all of their bad reviews and it either comes from their sketchy used car sales or their terrible service department. 

If you have a similar experience I highly encourage you to submit formal complaints to the appropriate department in Texas, so that other consumers do not fall victim to their predatory practices.",1.0

A million stars for this wonderful soul!!!!

28,"June 17, 2019","I went to get my car after waiting for three weeks for them to fix my car after initially they told me it would take a week. I called constantly to see if it was ready and would sometimes wait on the phone for over 45 minutes. They showed no respect for my time. After finally telling me my car was ready I went to go pick it up and they first told me they were going to wash it, after waiting for an hour and a half, Mr. Jesse Dominguez saw us and came up to ask and told us he had noticed we were sitting for a while and if he could help with anything. We told him we were picking up my car and went to check on it only to find out my car was just sitting there and not being washed. He took care of the issue and within thirty minutes my car was ready although I still waited a total of two hours. Very disappointed in the service and the utter lack of respect for my time by some of the employees. I commend Mr. Jesse Dominguez for being helpful. ",1.0

50,"June 08, 2019","I started with my web search for vehicles, which led me to Mike Calvert.  i has not previously purchased from them, but the communication was effortless.  I talked with Jaylon, my salesman via text about the vehicle and he set up a test drive with the car waiting for me with my name on a “this vehicle is waiting for...“ sheet in the front window.  The vehicle was parked right out front, we test drove it, came in and got right to business.  The negotiations were minimal, despite my demands.  Jaylon was not pushy and he seemed to fight for the best possible deal.  The car buying experience is rarely fun, quick, or easy, but the whole team here made it as close as possible and I would definitely come back again for my next vehicle!  ",4.4

He was fantastic and became the primary reason we purchased a vehicle  from this dealership. In fact, once we met Lacayo, we didn't bother looking at any other dealerships, it became just a matter of which car & model we'd purchase.

 Lacsyo was helpful, professional, and very accommodating in every step of the process, never pushy nor resorting to high pressure tactics. It began with a general look & see, followed by a test drive. We were in no rush to buy, so he patiently noted what features, color combos, and accessories we wanted. Since they didn't have a match in their inventory,  he brought one in for us. It was exactly what we wanted!

185,"April 07, 2019","We had shopped around on several sites online and came across a 2016 used van that looked clean and had low mileage, so I requested more information. Brian Hartland the online sales rep for the dealership (Mike Calvert Toyota) responded quickly to my questions. He confirmed the van was still available and took new pictures and a video walkthrough of the van so we would know what to expect. Overall good buying experience, the financing and the insurance parts were the most difficult to get through. We were there about 5 hours total with the majority of that spent sorting out insurance and financing. 

If I could recommend anything to someone buying a car anywhere, if you go on the weekend and your insurance office is closed (and you only happen to have liability insurance on your other car) expect to need to add a new comprehensive policy just for the car you are financing (we hadn’t financed a car before). Thankfully they did have an Allstate insurance office there at the dealership so we could get a temporary comprehensive policy in order to drive off the lot (and use Toyota financing). Also, if I was doing it all over again we would have worked with our personal bank more to arrange financing beforehand. Toyota financing still ended up having very competitive rates in our situation.

Thanks Brian for a helping our growing family find the van we needed!",4.6

439,"November 29, 2018","I can't speak for the rest of the employees, but Prince Adrian sure is a piece of work. I called the dealer and asked him if they had a specific make, model, and trim in stock. He immediately said yes. I was skeptical because of the quick response so I asked a second time to confirm and he again said that Mike Calvert Toyota had it. I thought, oh maybe this guy just really knows his inventory. Turns out Prince Adrian is just a scammer.

I drive the 45 minutes out to the dealer. Since Prince Adrian was busy (or hiding), another employee took over just to inform me that they don't have the car in stock... Not even one with a different trim... So either Prince Adrian straight up lied to me so that I would consider another car or he's just too lazy to check.

At that point I was angry, but didn't want to blow up at the innocent guy helping me. When I asked him to go get Prince Adrian, the guy says he can't because Prince Adrian is the manager and this guy's boss. Eventually I find Prince Adrian hiding in this glass employee area. I motion for him to come out and he refuses. I finally get him out and start asking him why he couldn't spend the time to check on the car before I drove all the out there. He just blows it off and says there's nothing he could do about it, too bad, and starts to walk away. (what??)  So I had a few choice words for him as he's walking away. It looked like the other employees were enjoying me saying the things they probably want to say to their boss. Let's just say I won't be deciding to buy a car from Mike Calvert Toyota ever.",1.0

448,"November 28, 2018","I come from a long line of Toyota drivers. My grandpa, my dad, and me. They are super reliable.

However, SOME of the people at Mike Calvert Toyota are DISHONEST.

First, I got a quote online and the sales person on the floor did not want to honor the price, but his manager made him. 

Then, while we were filling out paperwork they LIED about ‘having to run THEIR CREDIT CHECK’ if you did not get a loan through them. 

FYI you should not have to go through this credit check from them.

They also LIED and told me that it’s a federal requirement and my information WOULD NOT be shared, and I could not proceed if I did not do this credit check, so I went ahead.

Fast forward a couple of months later...I spoke with my mortgage loan officer and she was baffled at the fact that they ran a credit check hand in hand with my bank for the car loan. Fortunately, this did not hurt my chances of getting a mortgage loan.

Long story short, I’ve been getting calls all the time from insurance agents about my car, and they are so freaking annoying.

Mike Calvert Toyota SOLD my information from the credit check to these “insurance” businesses to get money for ‘new business prospect’ for insurance. THAT IS HIGHLY UNETHICAL!

Normally, if I don’t have anything nice to say, I won’t say it, but these phone calls (that you can’t get rid of) is getting VERY tiresome.

DO NOT BUY from Mike Calvert Toyota unless you want to constantly get phone calls about extending your insurance on your car all day long.",3.4

After 3 hours they call me to tell me the check engine light is on because of an OS sensor. They tell me it is $450 to fix it, but have to order the part. 

1)  Why would a dealership not have this part. OK, i can deal with that.
2)  They drop me off at work, no  complaints, not a word about anything, driver says to call him before 3:30 PM for pick up. I call at 3:00 PM and he says he cannot pick me up, i am all of a sudden too far by 3 miles. 
3) I call the office  and am told that i am on my own and basically too bad. No concern for my welfare, how i will get home from work, or anything humanity at all. Not even one inch of empathy. They could give a @$#@ what happens to me. Good luck he says on the phone with an attitude.
4) so they don't have a part they should have, it takes 24 hours to get the part, not likely. Then they refuse to pick me up with their shuttle out of the blue with no warning so i can make plans. 

STAY AWAY FROM THESE GUYS. I only service my Toyota at a Toyota dealership, have owned 3 Toyota and been to maybe 10 dealerships in the USA, this is the worst dealership and worst customer service i have ever dealt with when it comes to Toyota.

552,"September 04, 2018","I did a lot of research before I started my car buying process; I already knew the exact car I was going to buy - no frills needed. I had a list of the colors I would get, if available, in order from most to least preferred. So I started finding the best deal at a dealership I’d be willing to work with using the text option to communicate; no need to waste their time or mine. I’ve got to say my initial impression was a bit jaded. The text rep I got, named Stephen Lee, barely responded to me and while it sounded like he was going to give me a good deal, he was not answering my questions about the car. It started to feel like a waste of time. Then Ms. Gigi Davis got involved & it was smooth sailing from there. She promised me a great deal, so I went into the dealership and chose my #1 preference color; I even ended up with a couple of unexpected frills with the same price I was promised at the beginning of the process. The finance guy, Rick Broussard, was nice and personable. I wish I got a better interest rate but i blame myself for not doing enough research on that end. All in all, a great experience. ",5.0

660,"June 26, 2018","I was there for regular maintenance, and was tole by the staff that it should take 1hr-1hr 15min. 2hr later, he came and told me that my coolant is leaking, that's why it takes so long. They showed me that the hose is completely broken and the coolant reservior is empty, and i was lucky that I bring it in today otherwise it'll heat up the engine and end up damaging it. But does it take them an extra hour just to figure out this? I strongly suspect that am I really that lucky that I come for maint just in time when my coolant is empty. There was liquid all over the engine and the reservior, which was obviously the coolant and the hose was completely broken and hanging there. So apparently, the resevior wasn't empty when I got there, and they broke and pull of the hose and emptied the coolant just to force me to repair it with them. I was aware that I have a leak in the hose, but there wasn't any alert of heat up issues telling me that it is leaky. But when they showed it to me, the hose was just  hanging there. I doubt that if it's completely broken and I could have never had issues with engine heating up. I asked if they have any solution just for today because i was running in a hurry, and they told me we can fill the coolant but it'll be empty again very fast if you have a broken hose, and it won't even last for today. So i don't have any option other than repair it right now with them. There change a big a chunk of money for this simple repair, which is understandable for a dealership. And even if they don't break it and just tell me it's leaky, I probably will just repair it there since I don't want to bother finding somewhere else and I always prefer genuine parts. But they made your problem worse just to FORCE YOU to repair it there is ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE! Would have sued them if I took a picture before my visit and had proof of it.",1.0

My recent visits have been increasingly more aggravating as the staff won’t fix the problems that I have requested to be fixed instead they have slapped proverbial band-aids on the bigger issues instead of making the actual repairs I have requested. The continuous trips that I have had to make up there or the days off I have wasted because of this tiny issue is ridiculous. 

The only person that seems to enjoy being good at their job is Mike from Service, other than that they seem poorly trained and poorly incentived to provide good customer service.

I went back to MC and spoke with the manager. He said he’d have them look at it right away. He came back and apologized and said he confirmed that all of the service was done (I’m still not optimistic, to be honest) and asked if I wanted them to clean the car up. I accepted. He said he’d have them drop what they were doing and take care of it. About 40 minutes later, another service person came and handed me my keys. The wash that took 40 minutes was no better than my Mister Car Wash exterior-only subscription, as there was still water dripping from my mirrors, which eventually turned into water spots on the side of my car. My initial 5k service took an hour and 10 minutes. My return visit, due to MC’s error, took another 50 minutes.

I asked if it was certified, was assured it was, and asked if it had been a demo because of the low mileage. I was told it was not a demo but a trade in, that maybe the buyer wanted a larger car or something. I appreciate that Stephen did some research before I arrived and informed me that the car was traded in because it had been in an accident and was still in collision repair (odd to use a vehicle in the collision repair shop to entice buyers in), but he would offer me a new one with the same upgraded features for not much more. I appreciate Stephen’s integrity. Wish the online advertising was done with the same integrity.

New battery replacement before service would be $160. I bought my battery myself for $80 and did it for free at AutoZone. Battery terminals only cost $15 each and my problem was only the positive one, but they insisted on replacing both for $80+$65 service (initially told me service would be $35 on voicemail before I got there), coming to about $150 (the whole service was completed in less than 5 minutes). I was told battery hold down would cost my $80 before service, but I bought this for only $3 at AutoZone and did it myself in less than 1 minute. The constant price inflation despite me being a customer here is quite discouraging, and it looks like I'll start my search for a local mechanic who will be friendly to my pocket. I'm just starting my job and 1 car is putting me into so much debt when it didn't have it. 
In conclusion, I paid $500 for a service that could have all be done for less than $100. I wouldn't have minded paying 200 or 250, but 500 and something is just too much.

995,"April 27, 2018","I went to Mike Calvert for a State Inspection, 4 new tires, and the complete 20-point inspection that is normally done with a 5K mile maintenance.  I called the day before my appointment to be sure the tires I wanted would be available.  Torry - the tires expert - assured me the tires would be waiting when I arrived for my appointment, or else he would call me to notify me of a delay.  But when I arrived for my appointment, the tires were not there, and Torry had not called me.  So, instead of getting all the work done in several hours while I waited, I had to leave the car overnight, and return the next day, and make 2 round trips instead of one.  

When I picked up my car the next day, all 4 tires were overinflated to 39 lbs, instead of the recommended 33 lbs.  The fact that something as simple as inflating the tires was not done correctly, it makes me wonder how well all the rest of the work was done.  

Also, the cashier did not do a very good job with my paperwork.  She was ""in training,"" but nobody seemed to be training her and helping her learn, so her training was mainly trial and error.  ",3.2

1035,"April 19, 2018","I bought my car from this dealership and have taken it in for almost every maintenance service ever since, for 8 years running. In 2015 the car started shaking when applied the brakes so I took it in and they told me it was the front brakes. Now I take my car to this dealership because I trust that they'll use original parts and since they're trained specifically to fix Toyota cars the high premiums I pay to do it with them would be worth it in the long run if I didn't have rework it. When I drove out though I noticed that the shaking had subsided but there was now a popping sound when I applied the brakes. I called several times to complain and try to get it fixed but they told me only option was to come in and wait in line. Now every time I've gone I've no less than 4 hours there and up 6 hours some times. That's a whole work shift almost and that kind of time is not easy to come by. Finally everything in the car started shaking and I figured it was the alignment so I used that opportunity to take it back in and ask them to also look into the popping sounds. Of course they didn't find anything but I left with popping now reduced and the shaking back, even worse than before. Again with a busy schedule and not having a whole day to go spend over there I couldn't go back until December 2017. After another 5 hours or so they now told me I needed to have the same front brakes I just fixed a little over a year ago done again along with the back brakes. Their service representatives tried to use all kinds of arguments about mileage and driving styles. I drove the car on original brakes for 5 plus years and 3 times the number of miles and all of a sudden my driving style changed and I'm burning them up in less than half the time and not even a quarter of the miles? I went to the service manager who was gracious enough to offer to do the front brakes for free but I was going to have to wait another 2 to 4 hours. I was traveling to Nigeria for my wedding in a couple of days and had all kinds of stuff to still get done and couldn't afford to wait that much longer after having spent half of a whole day there so I left. Fast to this last visit, I was on vacation and already knew what they were going to say and I was hoping I'd at least get the same offer they had extended just a couple months back but the service manager that made the promise was not there anymore and conveniently there was no documentation of my ordeal to go on. The new service manager Jose changed the rhetoric to say that mileage and driving style dont matter, they just warranty their work for 1 year and that's it. Heck for a one year warranty I can go to autozone to buy my own parts and have the roadside mechanic on my street do the job for less than half the price. Personally I think the first guy that did the job just tightened the brakes without changing the pads that I paid for. There was no apology for a job very shabbily done or for endangering my life by making me drive on bad brakes for such a long time. All he offered was a $25 discount for each brake and basically told me I was lying about the previous manager offering to do the front brakes at no charge since it was a rework of a job I had already paid for that by all indications didn't get done to begin with. I drive almost an hour from house to this dealership to get my car serviced after having similar shady dealings at the Toyota dealership on Bissonnet and 59. At this point I think I'll just take my chances with the neighborhood roadside mechanic and at least save on the gas and wait time. Totally disappointed and betrayed. I will not go back here unless they make an honest effort to redress this.",1.0

At most there is well dressed elderly man who puts numbered papers on my windshield but still usually I have to wait around 30-40 minutes before a service worker will pick up my case.   Then,  often the wait time to get my car serviced is 1.5-2 hrs.  This is very inconvenient. There is also a man who without asking will circle the same spot on my windshield telling me he can fix it and it’ll be free through my insurance.  Trouble is I hired him to do it already a long time ago, the nick was still there, and every time I go back there the same man circles the same spot and tell me he can fix it. I don’t think he remembers me at all and I don’t believe he ever fixed it in the first place.  I think he’s just there to make money off my insurance.  You should really get rid of him.

1239,"November 05, 2007","I went to Mike Calvert Toyota for body work to my Celica after having had an accident.  The total damages came to about $3500 and were covered by the insurance of the woman who hit my car.  The poor service started as soon as I walked in the door.  None of the service advisors even look up and greet the customer.  They are all too busy on the phone making bids or personal phone calls.  After being ignored for 10 minutes one of the guys took in information and I left my car with them.  They estimated it would be ready in about a week and promise to keep me updated.  I never got any calls from them.  After numerous calls from me they said the car was ready for pickup on day 10.  

I paid my bill and they when they drove my car out to the front it was covered in a layer of dirt and a big muddy footprint was on the inside of the driver door.  I guess they don't use their hands to open car doors from the inside.  Worst of all in the work order I had paid $500 for them to strip and repaint the front bumper cover of the car.  When they presented the car to me the bumper had not been touched and still had damage from the collision on it.  The service guy came outside and said ""yeah you are right it is not fixed"".  I left the car again and they promised it would be ready in 2 days.  Meanwhile, I called the 800 Toyota service center to make corporate aware of what kind of service they give to customers who spend money there.  When I picked up the car 2 days later they washed and detailed the car for me and asked me to call Toyota corporate back to tell them I was now a happy cutomers.  I get in my car to go home and find the tint on the doors peeling and bubbling.  Some TOTAL IMBECILE used amonia based glass cleaner on it.  I figured they might set fire to my car if I left it another time so I just drove it home as is and paid to have the tint fixed out of my pocket.  Oh, the hood was not lined up properly and there was tons of paint overspray on my a/c condensor.  The quality of the paint job was like a $200 paint job in an alley.

Mike Calvert also destroyed the a/c system in my Celica.  The car went in for scheduled maintenance when they called and said the a/c expansion valve was under recall and would be replaced free of charge.  I asked they not touch the system and was willing to sign a waiver to give up my rights to the recall.  They insisted it be done and that was the start of a nightmare.  The freon leaked out to a point where the a/c quit working after 3 months.  I took the car back and they could not find the problem so they just recharged it and gave it back to me.  Another 2 months and I was in the same boat but this time they wanted $75 to diagnose the problem.   I called the corporate line and got them to waive the charge.  A day later I get a call telling me the compressor is not good and will cost me $875 with parts and labor to get the a/c working.  The service advisor was extemely rude and said ""you have nothing to complain about"".  The people at corporate were very professional and nice but told me since the car was out of factory warantee I had no recourse.  I took the car to a private mechanic and had the system repaired properly for $500.  Mike Calvert Toyota never replaced the O-rings in the system and stopped the leaks.  I doubt they replaced the refridgerant oil in the system as it leaked out and hence contributed to compressor failure.  They should be fined by the EPA for all of the R-12 their neglect released into the air.",1.0
