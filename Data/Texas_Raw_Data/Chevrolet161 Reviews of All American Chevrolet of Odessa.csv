0,"March 10, 2020","Worst dealership I have ever dealt with and I buy a car ever year. Terrible customer service, terrible sales people and terrible finance people. Bought a suburban last year and they messed everything up even the name on the title. When we signed all the paperwork everything was fine but somehow my middle name ended up being replaced for my first name. The idiots didn’t get my disabled veteran plates like I had asked for. It was a simple plate transfer. My suburban came with weathertech mats and I had to drive back to Odessa 3 times to get them. Each time they said they had them in and they never did. Now that I have paid off the suburban I have been trying to contact someone for over a week to cancel my gap insurance and no one has yet to call me back. I asked to speak to a manager yesterday who told me to contact the lender to cancel it. That guy was also an idiot because I informed him I have always canceled them at the dealership but he insisted that it was through the lender. Called them this morning and he was WRONG.",1.0

84,"January 31, 2018","Buying a car here was the absolute worst experience I have ever had buying a car. From the time we walked in the door, the GM had a very snarky attitude. When we were then introduced to Raul our sales guy, he didn't even try to sell us a vehicle. When I came back the next day for the car I wanted, they gave me run around after run around. I ended up spending 4 hrs at the dealership. Any questions I brought up, Raul would disappear into the office for 30 minutes. I had to ask 4 times for the keys to see the inside of the car and test drive it. From someone who buys cars yearly, I have enough knowledge about how dealerships work.  I can assure All American in Odessa will never have my business again nor referrals. These people shouldn't even be in sales. 0 effort. Yet, at the end of the day when I finally got my car (which had a flat tire) Raul had to nerve to ask for a good review?!?!",1.0

87,"November 28, 2017","We loved working  with Barbara. she got me in the car I wanted. The only issue was we walked around the parking lot for at least 30 minutes with no one approaching us. The texting system worked to get a sales associate, it was just strange that no one greeted us outside.",4.4
88,"November 12, 2017",Wonder people. Christopher Wilson was the best sales man ever. Made buying a car fun. He is truly a great guy and made it enjoyable and so much fun to buy a car.

I will always go back to All American Chevrolet of Odessa to buy my next vehicle. They are truly the best. Can never thank them enough for working so hard to get me into my new car. Thank you all for getting me into my new car you are truly the best. May God bless each and everyone of you everyday.,5.0
89,"November 10, 2017","We took our car there after hail damage. They scheduled  us a month and a half after the event, so I figured this should go smoothly. Even though they told us it would take only a week and a half, it took ten a half weeks for them to finally finish. They kept lying to us and postponing from week to week. Sometimes there was no answer when we would call and no reliable update. They left he car unprotected in the sun and dust, and the interior that used to still smell like new is now all damaged  with black fingerprints on the chairs. Lying, incompetent managers! Would not got there ever again.",1.0

I'd do it all over again!",5.0
91,"October 15, 2017",Dropped my vehicle off Monday gave the service rep (Andrew) the symptoms along with the OBD codes I observed with my code reader.  Of course they came up with something totally different so that the special extended warranty would not apply. Anyway after going back and forth with Andrew via email (his choice of communication) on the issue he assured me that their diagnosis and corrective action was correct. I emailed him back and asked him if the vehicle was ready for pickup. I did not get a response so I emailed him again with the same question and no response. So I emailed the service manager with no response. The next day I emailed the General manager no response either. Maybe they lost my truck or are hiding something. I live 45 minutes from the dealership so I can't just stop by. Good luck if you want a straight answer from this place.,1.4

We met the service department (Lety) and she explained all our new warranty and set up our first oil change appointment. Ronnie in finance was quick and very thorough with the paperwork and the bottom line price was exactly what Joey and Joel said it would be. Even the finance guy explained all the new features and extras received with our new car and explained the various warranty coverage offered as well. We drove away with a brand new car and it was hassle and stress free. My husband even got to ""bang the gong"" after we got the keys. I highly recommend this sales team for your next purchase! ",5.0

I asked them about my appointment and the response I got was first come first serve. I saw a car today I wanted, when I showed up I got to test drive the car and then said I will take it. I was a cash buyer. the sales guy went into do some paperwork and then came out a said a sale manager named Vinsin Phan just decided to hold the car for one of his customers later that day. I stated its a first come first serve, and he said he cant sell me the car. I will never bring my money to this dealership and I suggest you don't either. ",1.0

119,"September 26, 2016","To start off I had purchased my vehicle and came to discover that the DVD player would't work.  I went through several managers, left a message with one of the GM's of the dealership and even came in to contact with the other GM which was of no help.  Needless to say my vehicle was out for an entire month for something as simple as a DVD player.  That is until my situation was placed in the hands of the GREATEST manager I have ever dealt with in regards to any dealership.  Joey was absolutely awesome!!!  Once he got his hands on the matter it took him only 7 days to resolve my issue.  He and the car salesman Edward took great care of us.  If you do visit this dealership,  make sure that you have Edward Terrazas as your salesman, and Joey Cadenhead as the overseeing supervisor for anything that needs to be escalated to him.  In all Joey should be the GM of this facility, he was absolutely amazing, generous and over the top.  Edward made sure to follow through with each step that was going on with my vehicle.  So thank you Joey and Edward for everything!!!  My 5 star rating is for you two gentlemen.",4.6

126,"June 10, 2016","I rated this dealerships service department one star only because zero was not an option !  I brought my 2012 1500 Z71 in due to some noise in the drive train. The Service Advisor called me several days later and reported that the issue was the front differential. Further, he stated that the warranty WOULD NOT COVER THE REPAIR. The truck only has 75,00 miles on it....well below the 100,000 mile power-train warranty.  Their excuse... ( you're not going to believe this one... ) The front differential got hot due to the 4 wheel drive selector being set to ""auto"" and damaged the front differential beyond repair.  I read my owners manual cover-to-cover and it refers to not utilizing full-time 4 wheel drive on dry pavement (duhh..) but makes no mention of the ""auto"" setting being harmful to the front differential, transfer case etc... All it mentions is that your fuel economy could suffer a little.  It MOST CERTAINLY DOES NOT STATE ANYWHERE IN THE OWNERS MANUAL that the warranty will be voided for doing so !  These folks are making up their own set of rules so I guess I'm in for a $3600.00 (MINIMUM) hit to my bank account... but hey,,,, better for me to take the hit that a multi million dollar operation like All American.  Regrettably, this will end a 40+ year relationship between myself and GM.  They will never see another dime of my money so I hope they really enjoy this ""victory"" over yet another little guy ! To say that the Service Advisor (Ruben Ochoa) was anything less than arrogant and extremely rude would be remiss. When I visited the dealership personally (he would not return my calls) he told me that the decision not to honor the warranty had already been made ""AND THAT'S IT !!!!!  How this guy got a job dealing with the public is completely beyond my comprehension. My next step is to refer to Chevrolet Customer Service to see if they can help, although if one reads their reviews, they are pretty ""impotent"" themselves when it comes to serving the customers needs.....  I'm sure that All (un) American will send some kind of ""canned"" response from the management of the dealership to try and save some integrity in this forum but PLEASE don't believe it... it's all smoke and mirrors !!!!  So friends, please, please don' be taken in by then glitzy showroom and well dressed staff. This establishment is nothing less than a den of thieves. ",1.0

154,"November 14, 2013","Recently my husband and I purchased a new vehicle from this dealership.  We purchased the vehicle on a Friday and it was to be delivered to us the following Monday.  We didn't really expect it on Monday, as other things were being done to the truck such as running boards added and also a fifth wheel.  However, the following Friday the vehicle had not been delivered nor had we been contacted.  We began calling and 3 different times were told days the vehicle would be delivered.  It was not, and again we were not called to say they were not bringing it.  Finally, we insisted that we had to have the vehicle as we were going out of town and after being assured by the general manager the truck would be delivered, the salesperson then called and asked if she could bring it the next day instead.  After being told we had to have the truck, it was delivered as the general manager promised, but it was not even washed or cleaned up in any way.  The keys were handed to my husband with ""I owe you a wash job"".  No ""thank you"", no ""sorry for the delay"", or ""I hope this didn't inconvenience you in any way"".  This is a large diesel truck and I live 52 miles away, so I don't think I will be driving all the way to Odessa for a wash job.  I will not be purchasing another vehicle from this dealership.  ",3.5

158,"July 25, 2013",We bought a chevy cruze 2 years ago. About a year ago I had my husband take the car in cause it wasnt starting right. The service guy said nothing was wrong with it. Three days ago I went to start my car n the anti theft symbol came up n my car started acting weird. I turned off the car n restarted it. Ran fine for the rest of the day. The next night it did the same thing. Well...the next day I call n let them know I am going to b bringing in my car n they let me know its gonna b about three maybe four days before they can even look at it. Knowing how much buisness they must have due to the amount of people here I dont mind I just wanted it fixed it. I go to start my car n it wont crank over at all. Its almost like the battery was dead. So I call them back n they give me a number to call so it can b towed in. That number was the best service out of this whole ordeal. My husband called to let them know it was being towed n Dan decided to tell him if we didnt like there time frame we could always take car some where else if we thought a few days it was gonna take to have time to look at not to our liking. That was never the issue. It was as if he didnt want to bother with my car. They sure wanted our buisness in buying it but now that it is having problems they have nothing but attitude n extremely rude.  A guy called this morning trying to tell me he thought my battery was going out. I told him im not taking my car back till its fixed right n im not some stupid woman that I do have a husband that he can deal with from here on out. I dont know much about cars but im pretty sure my battery going out is not gonna make a sound of metal rubbing n make my control panel flake out. We will see what they come up with! next...,1.0

The second oil change after that they had my car for 5 days before they let me have it because they stripped the drain plug.
