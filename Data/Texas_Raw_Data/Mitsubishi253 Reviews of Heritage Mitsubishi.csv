0,"July 24, 2019","Si i was at this dealership for a minimum of three hours. I really appreciate that they were able to get me in a car but the sales guy never mentioned a referral gift. So when I did, they want to tell me I won’t get the referral gift because I didn’t send them to correct sales guy. First of all I referred someone because I thought they were great. I did this out of my own thoughtfulness. It just so happened that the financier told my referee I would get $100 and now they want to say it’s not valid. The company just sold 2 $30,000 cars?! Seriously. I’m mad.",3.4

I was shopping for car for over month and had stop by to look 4 or 5 times, even though I told them I was working w/ Scott May they helped me every time if he was busy or off.

10,"April 06, 2019","We were on our way to Dallas to purchase a used vehicle for my daughter and we stopped in and decided to buy local today. That decision was cemented by Scott May and the General manager. It’s a smaller dealership and has much less of the pressure of the big guys. Scott was open and they even let me talk with the prior owner about maintenance, history, problems, or anything I wanted. I felt they wanted me to be confident in my purchase.
I recommend Scott May and the purchase process was quick and very simple. The F&I guy did not pressure me into buying add ones and extras... it was a smooth and very fast transaction.
I’m also glad we left with a full tank, the vehicle I just bought last month from a large local dealership only gave less than half a tank. 
I hate that some dealerships won’t fill your tank after spending thousands with them. 
Thanks Scott!! ",5.0

36,"January 23, 2019","We stopped by Heritage Mitsubishi ""just to look"" and left that day in a used town and country. We were dreading going to a dealership to buy expecting it to take all day and be a nightmare. They were wonderful! We were there a very short time with zero issues buying our car. However, the van we bought started dying on us. We took it to heritage and they started working on figuring out what the issue was. Long story short after a few attempts we met with Scott and Rocky and they put us in a different van. The one we have now is perfect for our growing family! It has all the bells and whistles every woman wants in her new mom-mobile. These guys went over and beyond our expectations. I cant describe how much they helped us during the process. Heritage Mitsubishi has an amazing staff and shows customer service at it's best! We will be back soon when are ready to buy again. Thank you Scott and Rocky for everything.",5.0

Also before we arrived, Scott had already done all of the behind the scenes work in terms of financing (payments, trade in value, warranties, and paperwork). Overall, we had a wonderful experience. There was no hassle or headaches typically related to searching for the perfect investment.

If you dread the idea of spending all day at the dealership buying a new car you should visit heritage Mitsubishi. Once we chose our vehicle, we worked out details through e-mail and text. I was able to arrive at the delearship, swap vehicles, and sign all paperwork in less than 30 minutes. Half of that time was spent moving car seats over. The service was impeccable and each person I encountered was willing to bend over backwards to make sure I was happy. I couldn’t recommend heritage Mitsubishi highly enough. ",5.0

Thanks!",5.0
204,"February 17, 2018","Back in 2016, I found a used Toyota Corolla online and messaged Scott, a lifelong friend.  Scott was out of town so he sent me to Graham.  Graham was amazing working with me so that I could get the car for my daughter who was in college in Kansas.  Couldn't ask for two better guys, who are class acts, to assist me in the car buying process!  ",5.0
205,"February 17, 2018","Our little family has been eyeing the Mitsubishi Outlander since 2016! For TWO years we asked every question under the SUN about this vehicle and Scott patiently and happily answered and provided every stitch of (sometimes crazy) info we requested! After our extensive ""research"", we decided to go ahead and grab up our new 2018 Mitsubishi Outlander! If you are wanting a new or ""new to you"" vehicle I highly recommend calling Heritage and asking for Scott May! Not only is he easier on the eyes, he is patient and not a bit pushy! He takes his time with you and really enjoys getting to meet new people! I appreciate THE FACT that we now have a new vehicle to tote around our family and we have made a lifelong friend in the process! Thank you Scott May at Heritage for being so awesome!

Scott made good on making sure I had my three must haves when the car he found for me didn’t have remote start as advertised. He told me before I took possession of my car and where to go to get remote start installed and on Friday I had remote start added at no cost to me .. Scott went above and beyond when he didn’t have to. thank you Scott for going above and beyond and for making the trade in as less painful as you could because you knew what my Mustang meant to me.

252,"March 19, 2017","I recently purchased a 2009 Toyota Tundra from Scott May at Heritage Mitsubishi. I had originally come in to look at a Ford, but after the demo, it was not exactly what I was looking for. However, they had just gotten the Tundra in trade, and it proved to be perfect for my needs. They gave me a very fair price, and actually let me use their computer to research the year, model, and price to confirm that it was a good deal. They had their mechanic go through the truck in detail, including looking for leaks, wear and tear, and checking the alignment, and they gave me an oil change and filled the tank at no extra charge. Scott introduced me to their service department, who have been very nice and FAST. I have driven the truck now for two hundred miles, city and highway; I've gone over it in detail myself; and I'm still pleased. I'm planning on using Heritage for my oil changes and service in the future. All in all, it was a great experience and I can recommend Heritage Mitsubishi without reservation. ",5.0
