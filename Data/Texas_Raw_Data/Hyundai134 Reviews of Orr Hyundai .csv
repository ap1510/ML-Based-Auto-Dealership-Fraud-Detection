0,"August 29, 2018",I was trying to have my 2016 Hyundai nuscan car fixed. It has 21000 miles on it. I get there and they tell me to go to bumber and bumber. Might I add I had a huge leak in my coolant. So my car was over heating bad... I drove to bumber and bumber... Of which they don't work on cars... Had to drive all the way back to the dealership with a car that was over heating... For them to give me to a manager and finally they took my car to be fixed... On the day I was to pick it up I was told it would be ready at 3. At 4:00 I show up and had to wait till 4:45 to get my car. The whole first 20 min was them trying to find my car. Then I got told they where still washing it... Then why was I told to be there at 3 to get my car. When I did get my car they just left it sitting with the door open and air full blast. My rings had been moved. Which I'm too mad bout the rings. But leaving my car by itself with the door open and ac full blast? What the xxxx. Pretty upsetting experience. I did get all work done for free. Which it's under warranty and that's the only reason I went there to do it. But they clearly had no idea how to handle customers who need their car fixed and they had me driving around town with a car that was overheating. I could have ruined my motor on a car I'm paying $36000 on because they wanted me to go to bumber and bumber.. Need training there. Bad. ,2.6
