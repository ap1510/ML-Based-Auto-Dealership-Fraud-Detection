0,"May 01, 2020","I have a Kia Telluride 2020, there has been an on going issue with it, I’ve taken it in 5 times from the start of February, it only has 27,000 miles on it. I dealt with Roy the service manager he made me feel like I didn’t know what I was talking about, they were constantly out of loaner cars, so they couldn’t keep my car longer than a day at time, he admitted my car shouldn’t have issues, and he hasn’t seen issues with the gas gage, or distance to empty, it was a compete run around. Until the 4th time I took it in, that problem was fixed for the time being, it’s happening again. There was supposed to be a tech that works for Kia coming out, and never did. He (Roy) makes you feel like your problem isn’t important, now I have to contact consumer relations because he refuses to fix the issue with my car or acknowledge their is still one. When it comes down to Kia, he doesn’t want the blame, but it will fall on him because he isn’t very knowledgeable, fair, and he is very arrogant to problems that he “can’t fix” he tries to say “I’ve never seen this” “do you fill your car up?” “ Did you reset the MPG setting?” “I’ve gotten up to 29 miles” “you shouldn’t drive so fast, maybe try driving like a grandma” my point is my car goes through gas so quickly and it shouldn’t and he claims it’s the way I drive it, please keep in mind I have children I don’t drive recklessly, so please avoid spending your money there. You’ll eventually regret it if you do.",1.0

2,"December 31, 2019","DO NOT BUY HERE!!!My wife and I came in to see a vehicle  that was published online as certified for $7,000 for our kids.  We dealt with a salesman who showed us the vehicle and allowed us to test drive it. Once we sat down to discuss the final price of the vehicle, we were advised by the salesman that the vehicle price was misprinted and the price was higher, but they would honor what was printed online.  Once the total numbers were put together, it was also advised that although the vehicle is described as certified it was an additional cost of $1,290 that I would be responsible for.  The total drive out on a $7,000 vehicle  was over $9,200.  This did not make sense.  I spoke with a manager and at advised him that the internet ad website for Beck & Masten Kia showed the vehicle at $7,000 certified. The manager stated that there are disclaimers on the website, and that they were not going to negotiate any further on the vehicle.  I then spoke with a general manager Mr. A. Khan.  He advised the same. at this point I explained that I would pay $8,000 drive out for the vehicle. Mr. Khan went and put some numbers together for me and the total was still over $9,200. He admitted that this is the mistake of the dealership and explained the dealership felt they were being fair since they were honoring the $7,000 price. Again, the price showed $7,000 and stated that the vehicle is certified pre-owned. I asked mr. Khan how he would feel if he was in my shoes, he attempted to work his way around a question and advised that advised that this is fair. Beck & Masten has been around for years.  My family has purchased a vehicle from them before many many years ago. This is a horrible way to conduct business. Please beware if you go to this dealership, they have no sense of Customer Loyalty nor do they care about maintaining a positive reputation.",1.0
3,"August 10, 2019","This was an absolutely seamless transaction. We drove quite a way to check out this particular new Soul, since we have an aversion to black vehicles, inside and out, and none of our local Houston dealers had one that would work for us. We'd contacted the dealership prior to arriving, and were greeted by Javier Perez, a polite and knowledgeable individual, who had the car ready for us to view. The test drive went well, and we were set to bang heads over price and trade. While we did go back and forth for a time, the process was hardly the intimidating experience that many dealers choreograph. We're experienced negotiators, having spent decades in real estate, and found both Javier and Willie, his sales manager, highly professional throughout ... no pricey additions or hidden charges,  Our trade was fairly valued, and the Soul EX was attractively priced, due both to the manufacturer's incentives and B&M's discounts. While the F&I process could use some technological updating, Drey Smith, the finance manager, was excellent ... courteous, with no pressure to buy those dealer add-ons. He was able to structure the details, so that we could take advantage of the rebate for financing through Kia, and still pay off the note when the first installment is due ... a much better deal than a straight cash sale. We drove away confident that we'd purchased a great vehicle from an ethical dealer. Go see Javier ... you'll be pleased.",5.0
4,"July 31, 2019","Astonishment mixed with disappointment 
Like most of us over the years we have had our vehicles serviced by great dealerships and not so great.
Having been the owner Chevy, BMX, Audi, Infinity, VW and now Kia I’ve seen a few and to be fair I’m not high maintenance or over fussy! I generally schedule the work and get it done without any issue and certainly have never felt the need to give a dealership any scathing review.

When it comes to Beck and Masten Service center, Tomball I must admit I’m disappointed and confused regarding the definition of customer service.
First my car had an issue a few months back, I made an appointment with them dropped the car off waited almost 10 days only to find not everything had been completed. 

Came back at a different time to have the work completed in addition to a 30k mile service. only to find it couldn’t be done due wrong part ordered so had to come back at anther time again for that., during the oil change full synthetic had been requested twice as per the Kia owner’s manual. Upon completion of the service I was informed a blend had been used and told to come back in under 5k miles for the next oil change as quote “Kia motors are not that great, so you shouldn’t go too long without us checking it” They refused to change the oil to full synthetic, so I obviously have found an alternative dealership that wants to do so.

I have a few other minor issues with the car that need addressed but will not ever waste another minute with Beck and Masten as I have no real confidence it will get done when scheduled and or it gets done correctly.

5,"February 27, 2019","I cannot describe how disappointed I am with the staff and business practices at Beck & Masten Kia. 

I purchased my pre-owned Fiat 500 in March of 2018. I was told the car was barely driven and was in great condition. During the paperwork process, I noticed two different errors on the contract that would have cost me  $2,000. This was corrected and I drove my car home. Four months later my car broke down on the highway. It was taken to a Fiat dealership for repairs and I was told the clutch and the transmission were both completely worn down and needed to be replaced. The repair technicians agreed that there was no way I could have caused such substantial damage in just a few months, especially with prior experience driving a manual car. It was sold to me with extensive damage. I contacted Beck & Masten Kia's service department who pulled up my warranty and assured me multiple times that these repairs would be covered by the warranty. This was not the case under a ""wear and tear"" clause. I was responsible for a portion of the repairs, which cost almost $3,000 in total. The dealership where I got repairs also informed me the vehicle's airbags had also deployed, which was never mentioned when I asked about the status of the vehicle at purchase. 

Throughout this process, I called and emailed my salesman, Carlos Barrera, multiple times with no response. I also emailed the head of service department, and called and emailed the General Manager. No response from everyone. 

I would not recommend purchasing a vehicle from Beck & Masten Kia. Stay far, far away.

6,"November 28, 2018",Scheduled oil change with service manager Roy and once I got on location I was greeted at the door by a new guy nme Matt very personable & polite.    Shortly after I left I was impressed in had gotten an update by text on my phone .   Then when I picked it up my father and I were surprised to see not only was the oil changed it was all nice & shiney and cleaned up..,4.8
7,"March 16, 2018",Bought my new Sorento in 2016 and LOVE it!  Chris Briggs in the service department has been exceptional in helping me by going above and beyond in taking care of me and my needs!  I feel confident every time I get in my car since it's been so dependable.  I would recommend to all!,5.0
8,"June 13, 2017","Our family has trusted this dealership four times, no regrets! Great tradein values, fast finance department, excellent vehicles, and Drey Smith has sold them all to us. We love his personality and professional demeanor, he is knowledgable and zero pressure, which is a refreshing change from what we are used to experiencing at a dealership.  He will be who we seek for the next round of vehicles as well.  ",5.0
9,"November 17, 2016","Agreed to purchase a used car.  They requested funds by cashiers check by FedEx overnight, which was done.  They received the check the next day, as scheduled, then called to say the car was sold to someone else.  ""Sorry.""  My check was returned, but they have not been forthcoming or prompt in covering expenses incurred as part of a transaction they botched.  I cannot recommended doing business with Beck and Masten Kia.",1.0
10,"August 10, 2016","Though I have leased 1 car and purchased 1 and my son on my recommendation purchased one, NEVER AGAIN.  We turned in our lease car and purchased another one, YET, they still have not grounded the car I turned in.  Kia finance continues to call me for payment though i was returned 2 months ago.  I have called and email repeatedly yet no help.  IT IS WITHOUT A DOUBT THE WORSE EXPERIENCE EVER.  I will never recommend or purchase another car from this horribly run dealership again",1.0
11,"July 21, 2016",Len Worsham is the best sales representative I have ever had the pleasure of working with. It is the first new car I have purchased that after getting home I didn't feel like we were taken advantage of.  I will buy from Len and this dealership again. ,5.0
12,"July 14, 2015","Called Amanda because their website has a virus.  Was told they had a lot of new 2015 Sorento's.  Got there was told they don't have any.  I had an Edmunds print out for a new 2015 Sorento.
I purchased a new 2015 Sportster from Drey Smith.  Was totally ripped off.  Charged the suggested retail price.  I had asked for an Edmunds report on the sportster.
It took them 4 hours to get the papers ready to sign and they just let me sit while they ran their mouths with each other.
Finance guy said the 100,000 mile policy cost less than the 50,000 policy.  I regret every going to this place.  Sent Drey Smith an email to get scratches taken care of.  He never answered my email nor took my phone calls.  Sean Samuel, Manager told me they have someone to do their body work on Tuesdays and  he would call me Monday, July 13, 2015 when he got to work and I could bring my sportster in to get scratches & smudges taken care of and he would have a loan car ready for me.  HE NEVER CALLED!!!
Don't be stupid like I was.  Go to another dealership.",1.4
13,"January 18, 2015","I have been searching online voraciously for weeks for the right vehicle at the right price. I had not looked at Kias much because they were generally a bit out of my price range. After looking at a Chevy Spark earlier in the day where they could not meet my price, I went back to cars.com and started my search again. I found a 2014 Kia Soul with only 3,682 miles. It was listed at 12,997. It also had so much more in the base model than the Spark and a Versa I had looked at days before, With the Soul, I didn't feel like I was looking at a base model with the array of auto controls on the steering wheel, the side and back tinted windows that are just cute and that nicely funky green color.

I called and talked to Drey Smith and i asked him the total with TT&L because I didn't want to drive there if it was out of my price range. I was short on the total price. Drey said he would work it out and we did. I headed that way, not realizing until we got there that they were ready to close. They stayed open until I had my car at my price. No hassling as I really felt like Drey listened to me when I told him what money I had to work with. I have never had this at any other dealership. Normally, when you tell them what you have to spend, the salesperson just ignores you and starts presenting costs and you have hours of, ""let me talk to the manager,"" back and forth frustration. I did NOT have that experience here. Drey understood I was serious about what I had to spend and simply made it work without any games. He was so friendly and we laughed and talked as the paper work got done. I actually had fun for what is normally a very stressful business transaction.

The big point that I realized when I got home was the total cost and actually what a deal I ended up with. Being curious, I went online and searched for the 2014 Kia Soul on autotrader and cars.com. I can tell you that with all of the listing throughout Houston, I got the absolute best price for the mileage. Not one other listings for 2014 was cheaper and either in the same price range or several thousand more dollars. However all of those cars had 30, to 50K mileage. I consider that I was buying a new car at a used car price. Thank you Beck & Masten.  Let's just say that I am a happy, happy Soul tonight!",5.0
14,"December 04, 2014","I drove two hours to buy a vehicle at this location. When I got there, the experience  was quite pleasurable. However, I needed a cosigner. It was around 7:30 at night at this point. I had someone to cosign for me, however was not able to contact him to submit the credit application. So, we were unable to complete our business that evening. The next day, I successfully contacted and had the person who was to cosign with me complete the application. I was told the day before that everything would be handled the next day and I would drive off with the vehicle then. However, I was told after the application was submitted that nothing would be possible until the next day. I received a text message today from the agent that said they can't get me financing and that they suggest I try to finance through my credit union. I called the agent and spoke to him about it and asked a few questions and he said, ""I am not here to argue with you...I am here to sell cars for a living."" I asked to speak to Steve and I explained to him what was said to me and he apologized for it and proceeded to explain the particulars of the financing issue. Mind, I had been told several times, ""we are trying to earn your business."" After I had asked a few questions Steve proceeded to raise his voice at me and tell me that I was being very argumentative, that he is not going to put up with it and if I have financing issues, I should talk to my credit union. I responded by saying, ""Hey, aren't you trying to earn my business?"" To which he responded with, ""No, at this point I am not trying to earn your business. Have a nice day.""...and hung up on me. I then called and asked to speak to the GM and was transferred back to Steve. I told him who I was and paused for a moment to choose my words. He rudely stated in a raised voice, ""Look, I'm not going to sit here in silence. What do you have to say?"" I said, ""Sir, I am only..."" He cut me off by saying that I have no business buying a car there and not to call back. He hung up on me a second time. This was the worst experience  I have EVER encountered! I will never go back! As a matter of fact I am going to tell anyone and everyone I know to spread the word about this dealership. The people are rude, disrespectful to customers, and have no business in a customer service field. ",1.3
15,"May 10, 2013","I purchased a 2013 Sorento thru Harvey Greenway(sales) on 5-2-2013 & asked to send thru my debit card for the full $22,629.27. I was turned over to finance to complete the financial end & delt with Eddie Reynado. Not only was he rude & defensive when asked a simple question regarding a statement on the Buyers Order but he informed me the only reason he could not put the entire amount thru was because it was after 5pm & it only allowed him $1000 debit. He then said the ONLY way for me to pay this was to drive the 1hr. distance again the next day & bring a certified cashiers check. I explained that was not possible & Harvey(saleman) confirmed that wasn't necessary & to mail a personal check. I contacted my bank on 5-3rd & the bank manager was to contact Eddie & confirm sending thru the $21,629.27 on my debit card. I received a call from my bank on Monday saying she had left 6 messages over 3 days for Eddie & could not get him to call her back. I immediately contacted the General Manager""Mitch"" & he said he would handle this immediately. I again received a call from my bank on 5-9-2013 saying Kia still had not contacted her or tried to run the debit thru. I contacted the dealership AGAIN & was told the GM""Mitch"" was fired the very day I spoke with him & again it was turned over to Eddie to handle. I then received a call from Steve Koeulnicky(also in finance) & after explaining the problem, he said he would handle it. My next call came from my bank saying according to Steve they could not run more than $3000 thru on a dibit card & I was needed to go to bank & authorize a Cert. Cashers Check sent to Kia. I contacted Steve & asked why he did not bother to inform me of this when we spoke & he lied & said he did. The only thing he said to me was he would check into this problem & get it handled!!Luckily, before having to handle the check at the bank the next day(5-10) I received a call from my salesperson Harvey Greenway, apologizing for total screwup in the finance dept. & assuring me they could & would send this debit thru.(1st he had heard of problem was today) I had already called around 3 other Kia dealerships & was told debit's in that amount were standard & not a problem. I feel that Kia should be aware of the mishandling by their entire finance dept. of this dealership & the bald faced lie told to a customer to deny an employees incompetance. Let me say again, the salesperson Harvey Greenway was honest, thorough & VERY pleasant to deal with. It scares me to think what a screwup the finance dept. would have caused if I was trying to pay other than CASH.....I am recommending the dealership ONLY because I had great service from Salesman & am expecting the new GM, Pete Trammel, to handle the finance department incompetance.",2.3
16,"February 19, 2013","We chose Beck & Masten Kia because it had such great reviews and we don't regret it at all. We worked with Len Worsham. My Fiancee was the only one who has credit built up but it is still very poor. We weren't sure if we were going to be able to get a new car. Despite our challenges Len and the Finance department worked extremely hard for us and got us a NEW car in her name alone, no co-signer needed! On top of that we got the color we wanted and it is completely new! Len asked us how we were constantly as we waited and we were very clued in on what was going on as we waited. He even cleaned the car and filled up the tank for us before we left! It was the most amazing car experience we have had. Highly Highly recommend!",5.0
