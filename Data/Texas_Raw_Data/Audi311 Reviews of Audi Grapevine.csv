0,"June 23, 2020","Came in on a busy Saturday for my annual servicing (+ a recall notice).  Rene (my service advisor) quoted me 2.5hrs and even as busy as it was, he was exactly right.  Besides just my servicing, Renee cleaned the inside of my windshield AND got back to me on Mon about a quote  & the contact name & number for a serious ding someone so nicely left  on my passenger door.  Also, this time I was sent by email & text what was going on with my car and given the option to pay via my phone. I've seriously enjoyed everything from purchasing my car to the quality annual services @ Audi Grapevine (especially Rene Laurel's customer service)!",4.8

My wife is particularly at a high risk for the Corona virus and the staff took all of the cautions I ask for and could think of for servicing my vehicle.

10,"June 06, 2020","Just completed the purchase of a 2019 CPO Audi A6. I live in NY and communicated with My sales rep Syed Rahman via text and phone. He is the consummate professional and was extremely responsive to each text and call. Buying a car remotely from halfway across the country during COVID-19 COULD have been a disaster of an experience. It was anything but as Syed was nothing short of fantastic each step of the way. In fact, he just texted me to let me know the car was just picked up for delivery to NY. I opted to use my own delivery service, yet he texted me anyway. TEN GOLD STARS! 🌟🌟🌟 He clearly takes his job providing exceptional customer service very seriously. It was also good working with Shawn in finance— no high pressure nonsense, just info on my various choices which he explained and answered my questions about. Will update this review once I actually receive the car, but my experience to now with Syed and the team at Audi Grapevine has been terrific.",5.0

12,"June 04, 2020","I had leased a new Q3 from Audi Grapevine when they'd first opened the dealership in 2017.  Robert Jean was my salesperson.  He made me feel important (as a person...not just the means to a sale!)  Everyone I had worked with that during first transaction was so courteous and helpful--management, finance, service, new-car technology orientation, etc. Long story short...OF COURSE, I went back to see Robert and the Audi Grapevine team at the end of my lease!  And, they did not disappoint!  So, not only did I lease a new Q3, my son purchased the one I had been driving for the past three years! 
*PS  ""Aspen"" (the delightful, tech specialist who helped me this time) was wonderfully patient with me and my ""Roll-a-Dex mentality!    ",4.8

20,"May 26, 2020",Our experience at Audi Grapevine was great. Got the car we wanted quickly from Kansas. The negotiations went very well on both sides of the table. My wife is extremely happy with the car. We traded a great 2013 VW Beetle convertible that I am pretty sure you have already sold by the same day we picked up our car. Win/Win for all.,4.8

If I could leave negative stars for Sean in Finance I would.
Later I was reviewing the paper work & contract and noticed the monthly payment was in line with what I expected.
But, Sean put on contract 66 months not 60 as I stated.

First off after I told Sean NO 3 times on the Gap Policy, $995.00
Told Sean 2 times NO one dent policy. $1,000.00
Sean put it in the contract anyway.
 
Sean, failed to tell us the service policy he added was $2,400.00

After dealing with Chen in Sales being so up front and honest about everything, I let my guard down in dealing with Sean in Finance. Big mistake on my part.

After calling Sean, he said we could cancel the extra policies anytime.
Sean didn't seem to care he put things on the contract we said NO to.
Well, that takes 4-6 weeks to process with Group 1 cancellations. 
Now, we are stuck with an extra $4,395.00 on our note and an extra 6 months of payments.

I have to say our Sales person Chen, was excellent.
Be very cautious dealing with of Sean in Finance at Audi Grapevine.

That being said, I would definitely not do business with Sean at Audi Grapevine. 

I have purchased cars in the past from Park Place dealerships and never had anything like this to occur.

23,"May 18, 2020","If I could leave no stars,  I would.  Be very cautious when leasing a vehicle with Grapevine Audi. I recently leased a vehicle with them and during negotiations and while signing my contract,  a 36 month lease and only a 36 month lease was discussed. Imagine my surprise when I got my first note in the mail and discover it's a 42 month lease.  Not only that,  upon reviewing my paperwork provided by Sean in the finance department, none of my financial paperwork was provided. Yes,  shame on me for not paying more attention. However,  I had faith that what was coming out of their mouths was honest and was what was written on the contract.  Sean seems to think it's ok they did this though,  because he gave me a deal on the Audi protection plan. ",1.0

27,"May 08, 2020","I like going electronic with the servicing process.  Only issue with electronic servicing is when questions arise.  In this service, Audi electronically recommended I replace or watch 3 out of 4 tires.  I thought 3 tires recommendation was odd, in that I would never put 3 new tires on with 1 old tire, so I disregarded the recommendation for now.  ",4.6

35,"March 13, 2020","My experience at Audi Grapevine has been wonderful.  After driving a Corolla for 11 years, it was time for an upgrade.  I’ve been eyeing Audi for awhile, and I saw that Audi Grapevine had an A4 that caught my attention.  

My wife and I went to the dealership 15 minutes before closing because we were looking at other cars earlier that day.  We were primarily interested in test driving and Joe Peer helped us out.  He is very kind and helpful. He answered all my questions and then answered all my wife’s questions.  

We ended up loving the car and decided to purchase it. Audi Grapevine has haggle-free pricing, which saved a lot of time and headache going back and forth.  All the fees were reasonable so we decided to proceed. 

Jake Kaufman helped us with financing. He didn’t waste our time trying to sell products we didn’t express an interest in.  He was very nice and helpful.  However, when looking at extended warranties, Jake told us it began at the original in service date.  This was wrong and it began the date of purchase, which is a mistake that benefited us.  We got an extended warranty, but ended up changing our mind a few days later. We ended up leaving close to 9pm and we were pleasantly surprised to see Joe still there to a thank us. 

With regard to cancelling the extended warranty, Joe and Jake answered our questions and were very respectful about our decision to cancel. The cancellation process was very easy and I was impressed that no one was being pushy.  

When I took delivery of the vehicle, Joe answered all our questions.  I’ve also had random questions in the weeks since purchasing the vehicle, and he has been very responsive. 

Overall, my wife and I believe this to be one of our best car buying experiences.  I highly recommend this dealership and Joe Peer to anyone considering purchasing an Audi. ",5.0

38,"February 24, 2020",Left a review on google.  This dealer is horrible.  GM Mo does not return my calls.  Spent right at $1800 for maintenance and now Audi S7 has been in different place getting maintenance performed and scheduled at different dealer to get recall performed.   Again.  These guys are plain are crooks.  Mo left a firm response to my last posting.  Truly a joke ,1.0
39,"November 18, 2019","The people are the Dealership and Vernon as my Service Advisor represents customer service excellence....its a mark that I keeps your dealership in mind for my Q5.....because he may not be around on the days I bring my car in for service, I hope the other Advisors identifies with the same level of service as well!!

41,"November 05, 2019","On two different weekend we went in to purchase a vehicle.  Not only did Eddie the Sales Manger not want to deal with us, he did not get his facts straight and he tried to charge us extra for a Certified Pre-Owned Warranty that clearly still shows it is included in the price.  We walked out willing to pay cash because EDDIE does not know how to keep the Customer Happy.  Both Sales Ladies were the best, but having to deal with him, I will never recommend this dealership to anyone.  Go to Audi Plano, they know how to treat customers.

The finance department and technology department were first rate and timely.  Couldn't ask for a better experience from beginning the experience online to picking the car up at the dealership.

46,"November 01, 2019","In all my years of buying cars and servicing them, there is only ONE dealership that has always performed to the top of my satisfaction and that is AUDI Grapevine lead by Mr. Mo Saleh.  This is the third SUV in a couple of years from them and the AUDI engineering, quality and performance is why we went back but especially the quality of the dealership. It is really a very nice store for cars and SUV's and a great experience for shopping or service.

The e-tron is a phenomenal vehicle and to charge a tank of significant pollution reduce energy at a cost at home of about $4 for 200 miles of luxury driving is worth every penny for the innovation and quality. Why not come home in heated or ventilated seats that also will give you a massage, all while at the same time being an extremely safe environment of technology and luxury, clearly a smart good choice.

A couple weeks later I moved the car from the garage to the driveway & discovered a substantial puddle of coolant on the floor & a very low reservoir once again. Back to the dealership. They somehow had missed that the water pump assembly was leaking also. Another $1300.

Here's the thing: they owned up to their mistake in not thoroughly investigating the problem the 1st time and ate most of the 2nd bill for our inconvenience.

183,"July 16, 2018","Long story short, I was denied a warranty claim for my Audi A4 due to a CPO car being sold to me that was tuned prior to CPO certification without my knowledge. Being out $11,000 on a car with only 60,000 miles I went to sales to see if I could trade in the vehicle and wash my hands free of the car and get into something new. 

I scheduled an appointment with a salesman online, and was told an appraiser would take a look at my car in the shop before I arrived and get me a good offer. The online sales specialist advised to ask for a sales manager once  I arrived. 

I showed up to the showroom a few hours later as scheduled. The car was not appraised at all, the salesperson would not let me work with a sales manager as told by the internet sales specialist, and on top of all that, I had to wait 1.5 hours (30 minutes before close), watching the salesperson sit in the sales tower for an hour and a half, clearly running down the clock only to be presented with an insulting offer and no help whatsoever. 

I was offered $3500 for a 2014 A4 Premium Plus with every single option with only 60,000 miles on it. I was also told I would need to put $20,000 dollars down on top of the insulting offer without any appraisers looking at my vehicle. 

On top of that, the salesman had the gall to insinuate I did not know how trade difference worked and made it seem like I did not know that I would at least somewhat be upside down if the vehicle was traded in. I was well aware of this and the sales person would have known had he read the notes from the internet sales specialist. 

On top of it all, I was unable to test drive any vehicles at all. I asked about 4 of them in inventory according to their website. I was also lied to and was told that the Service Department does not up charge people when they take their vehicles in for service when they were ""explaining"" the offer for my vehicle. Obviously if the Service Department did not up charge people for servicing their vehicles, the dealer would not be in business. The Service department has to pay their employees somehow. 

Needless to say this is the second VW product I have owned that has had a bottom end of a motor fail with under 60,000 miles. I will never be buying another Volkswagen again and I will not be referring anyone to Audi Grapevine after this experience. ",2.0

The problem arose when Robert Jean shorted me over $400 in his agreed upon trade-in offer. I noticed the missing $400 difference and when I asked him to explain he told me that because I had a trade-in that Audi was doing me a favor by giving me a ""credit"" to lower my total tax to bring the trade-in offer up to the amount we agreed upon. I signed papers and accepted the vehicle. My husband would be there several days later to seal the deal. That evening we realized the sales tactic that Robert Jean had pulled. ""Audi's tax credit"" was actually a credit that I was legally entitled to from the beginning and they in fact shorted me the $400 as I had originally suspected. Robert Jean knew that his lie would seal the deal and he did whatever it took. Audi Grapevine has refused to fix this, despite admitting that Robert Jean's tactic was misleading.

Robert Jean blatantly lied and failed to mention a few other things as well:
1. That the used Audi I was purchasing has an open, unresolved recall. The Carfax was not accurate or up-to-date. 
2. That the Audi I was purchasing has a metal fluttering noise upon acceleration around most curves that they claim they cannot hear.
3. Before driving 2.5 hours to Audi Grapevine for this car, he told me he could not move any lower on the price because all of their cars come equipped with tinted windows and wheel lock kits. This was a blatant lie. My purchase has neither of those features, yet he would not deduct this $600 value from my purchase price once he had me there.

Audi Grapevine took advantage of me because I was a female, coming into their dealership made up of mostly men. They saw me as vulnerable because they knew I was distracted with my 8 year old and they ran with this opportunity. They now have my used 2012 Cadillac CTS listed for sale on their website despite the fact that my husband has not sign over his half of the paperwork and title. 

The used car sales manager offered me a tank of gas to ""make things right""!!! However, since writing this review, the General Manager, Mo Saleh, has reached out to me and offered to make this right by refunding me the money that Robert deducted from my trade in amount.",1.0
186,"January 06, 2018","I normally go to Audi Dallas, but decided to try out Audi Grapevine for their 49.95 special on oil changes to see if I would use them in the future instead. I set an appointment which priced the oil change at their special rate. Upon arrival, I also asked the advisor to add a state inspection and look at one of my tires to my list of things to do. I arrived at 7:30 and at around 9:20 the advisor comes over to let me know everything is done and also suggest a couple of more things for me to get worked on. She then returns a couple of minutes later letting me know my insurance wasn't in the glovebox and the tech was waiting on it to perform the state inspection. I thought my car was supposed to be done? My fault, I get her the insurance 10 minutes later. From here I don't hear from her until 10:30 to tell me that the machine was down and the state inspection wasn't performed. I then end up paying $121 for just an oil change! The advisor told me it was due to $50 in labor that was performed. Why add a promotion for the oil change if upon arrival it's going to be double that? On top of it all, it took me close to 3 hours to just get an oil change when I was quoted an hour. What they did all that time, who knows since my advisor never came around to update me or apologize for the wait. Lastly, I would have complained on a survey but I noticed when I got home my paperwork has another persons name, phone and address. Thanks a lot Audi Grapevine. ",1.6
187,"December 26, 2017","My new Audi Q7's brakes started squeaking.   It is particularly bad when in reverse.   I first took it to the service department at Audi Grapevine to be looked at 6 months ago.   Apparently it was a  known issue, and Audi was working on a fix.  I was told I'd have to live with it and wait.   Fine.   6 months and 15k miles later there's still no fix and my brakes still squeak.  It's pretty embarrassing.  Passengers all comment on it.   Increasingly frustrated, I took it back to Audi Grapevine last week.  Same result - known issue, but nothing can be done.  I tried to get them to contact someone at Audi to see if there was anything they could do (try different brake pads, machine the rotors, something, anything), but the service manager Rene said all they can do is put into the system that I'm effected by this ""known issue"".  He said Audi would ""email me"" when there was a fix.  Crazy.   

To top the whole thing off, I had an oil change done at the same time.   $390 for an air filter and oil change.   Seemed high, but I figured I got a car wash, vacuum and coffee out of it, so whatever.   But of course when the valet brings my car to the front for me to pick it up, its not washed or vacuumed at all.   I asked the valet if it was supposed to be cleaned and he said ""yeah, weird that they didn't"".   We sat there a little longer staring at each other and he finally said ""would you like me to take it back to have it washed?"".   I said yes, and waited another 20 minutes for it to be cleaned. 

The service here just isn't good.  Luxury care dealers love to talk about going the extra mile on service, but when it comes time to actually do something that would require effort, Audi Grapevine fails to live up to it's pledge.  All I wanted was someone to be an advocate for me with Audi.  I realize the technicians there aren't engineers and probably can't fix a manufacturing defect, BUT they could have tried some obvious fixes or at least made me feel like they tried to get someone at Audi to figure something out for me.   Everyone knows the brakes on this vehicle are an issue, so why not put a tiny bit of effort into solving the problem?   Sending me home to wait on an email from Audi (that I know will never come) after already waiting 6 months is just bad business.",1.2
188,"October 23, 2017",I went in to Audi Grapevine to lease a vehicle. I had the worse time being rushed by the Sales rep who constantly reminded me that I need to pick one vehicle and stick to it and not keep changing my mind. When it came down to the negotiation process and lease payments and terms it got even worse. I kept getting different price quotes for the same terms I was negotiating. The Finance team there wanted no part in working with the Customer or directly explaining to them how they came up with these lease terms and payment options. When I looked back there they were tossing a football or some sort of ball back and forth while laughing away. Horrible service and do not recommend this dealer to anyone.,1.0

They were going to get  the car back on Saturday. That didn't happen. On Monday I still had not heard from my Salesperson Shaun so I emailed him (you would think he would be the one following up with me since he was trying to sell a car) and he said the car was not in and he would let me know when the car was back. I get an email from him Monday night saying the car would be ready for me to look at on Tuesday. I showed up on Tuesday and my salesperson is off. He didnt even tell me he was off or to ask for someone else. I got ping ponged around and finally ended up with Alex. It took them over an hour to find the car for me to look at. They had no clue where it was on the lot. Once i decided i was going to buy the car Alex gave me a $3,000 higher price than what me and my Sales person Shaun agreed upon. What?!? I emailed Shaun when I got home asking him to explain to me the $3,000 increase and he said he would look into it and I have still yet to hear back from him with an update.

239,"January 13, 2016","UPDATE as of 1/9/16:
Daniel contacted my husband asking for someone who had my mother's first name and my husband's last name (obviously that person doesn't exist), in regards to the poorly written address complaint. My husband told him our correct names and who he might be asking for and Daniel asked for me. I called him back later and he explained everything is all perfect on their end with my information and address and that everything was put into their system correctly to begin with so Ryan was not at fault. He explained that the info was given to the company who owned the vehicle for the lien and they were the ones who put my info incorrectly into the system. My mother called in a later time and spoke with Daniel about the mix up in names wanting to make sure everything was correct and he immediately interrupted her without her being able to finish her sentence on why there was an issue in regards to correct information with her name and also with my financing information being butchered. He proceeded to blame the front desk people for wrongly entering incorrect information into their system, then he changed the story and said it was the car salesman who wrongly put in our information, and then he said that Ryan would never incorrectly put wrong information about a customer into the system as he is a perfectionist, etc etc. So his story continued to change about who wronged our financing information which clearly showed he was kissing Ryan's you-know-what for the sake of his own job. Either way, he was very short with me and very short with my mother and all in all showed extreme lack of respect for any of us. DFW Audi is beyond incompetent and I will never again purchase a car from them and will insist by word of mouth and reviews that others stay away. A car is one of the bigger things a person will purchase in life; you would think that the company selling would show some dignity. Shameful.

ORIGINAL:
The car salesman was friendly and did a decent job assisting me and the negotiation aspect of purchasing my car went well. Things plummeted once we were sent to finance with Ryan S. First we waited to even talk to him for almost 2 hours and by the time we were able to talk to him he could not have done a worse job doing his own job. We were there late in the evening and we were all tired. He had clearly had a long day so I was patient with him while his dry and unwelcoming manner would've normally been off-putting to me. However, instead of going over all of my options on the maintenance agreement packages, he told me which package I would be receiving (without explaining the cost) and gave a very brief run down of what it would include. Luckily I was ok with what the package entailed. He rushed us to sign all finance documents (which in the back of my mind made me question just how fast we could get everything done while still maintaining accuracy on all of my information). Well that later came true. I recently received some mail that was from a bank that he attempted to have me finance through, and it was the epitome of carelessness. My last name was misspelled, my street name was misspelled, my street is on a circle not a square so that was wrong, my apartment unit was not included, I live in Lewisville not Plano (but my cosigner was in Plano...maybe you got us crossed?) and yet my zip somehow managed to be Lewisville zip so at least that was correct. I'm shocked that USPS actually understood it was supposed to go to me! Thank goodness it had no sensitive information in it or I definitely would've held Ryan and DFW Audi accountable. We were all tired that evening, but I made sure all my information and documents were correct and I wasn't getting paid to do that! It seems like if you're handling someone's private personal information and it's your paying job to make sure of these things, you would at least not be THAT negligent. Come on!

Otherwise, I love my car.",1.0

I told them I bought the tires there, and they had a warranty on them. I was told that they do not even carry that size of tire, but they would gladly price 4 new tires for me (because they cannot replace two with a different brand).

Come to find out, I did buy them there (45 min later, and no new tire quote mind you), but they were not under warranty. All of the sudden, they could ORDER me two for 700.00.

Did the test drive on one car but ended up with another. When it got down to the 'deal' the offer they made on our 1.5 year, LOW mileage, car was an insult!  They then tried to blame us for the reason the offer they gave us  was so low!!  Really!!  By the time we got to the Finance Office it was around 630pm!! The dealership closes at 5! So you can imagine how tired we were!  The Finance person, Daniel F, was talking way to fast - we asked if he was talking so fast because he wanted to go home!!!  When it was time to leave all they  keep asking us for was the other set of keys! Not a word about , ""sorry it's so late"", ""sorry this took so long"" - nothing about ""caring"" about us.  Getting items out of our car... no box/bag was offered.  Luckily we had a bag to put items in!  THEN...
Awake enough, Sunday morning, to look over the paperwork, realized we were not asked when we'd like our payment date. We weren't told anything! When we'll receive our payment info, warranty info, who to contact in the service dept or even business cards to anyone - nothing!  Any other dealership - and we've bought several cars - would have given us MORE information than not enough!  The salesman did tell us to call him - gave us his card - to schedule a time to come back so he could explain some of the electronics on the car.  
When we called Monday morning to ask the Finance person about the payment date, he said ""I pushed it out as far as I could"".  We took that to sound like we are barely able to afford the car!!  We told him ""We didn't want it pushed out as far as it could"" !! He said that it's a lot of trouble to re-do the paperwork! 
You can rest assured that the only reason We'll go back to this dealership is because we have to!! 
Think real hard before dealing with this dealership!
We just want to add a little more...
We wrote the above Monday am - 
The more we think about the service we DIDN'T receive the more upset we get. Didn't receive a booklet/paperwork to even know what is covered under our extended warranty. Wheels have a lug nut - wasn't told where to find that - it's not in glove box. And on and on it goes.

243,"October 25, 2015","I purchased an Audi A6 from DFW Audi on 09/30/2015.  I have three major complaints which the dealership refuses to make right.
1.  Their lack of communications is appalling.  Phone calls and messages are not returned and satisfactory answers aren't  given on poised questions.  It takes several days and many phone calls to even get someone on the phone.  This is a total disregard for customer service.
2.  I test drove the car several times before I purchased it and told the dealership the brakes were soft.  They agreed to repair the brakes and several other small items discovered during their inspection.  They reported they had  replaced the front brake pads and rotors.  These repairs are supposedly under warranty for one year.  When I picked up the vehicle I noticed the brakes are grinding at slow speeds and sounds like metal on metal, screeching loudly.  This was a new noise the car was not making during the test drives.  Several of the dealership's  technicians  tried to convince us  that it was a normal noise that all cars make. I left the vehicle with them to make sure the repairs had been accomplished correctly.  The dealership is saying they found some ""new"" problems with the front bushings that is making the noise and they want over $1,500 to repair it.  The repair includes a front end alignment.  The dealership claimed they did a front end alignment when they repaired the brakes.  They should have noticed anything wrong with the bushings then and repaired them.  I've spoken to the Manager of the service department who agreed to drive the vehicle to make sure this was not a brake problem.  Now the manager of the service department  will not return my calls.     
3.  I purchased the car with the understanding the windshield would be repaired.  This was documented in the forms signed during the purchase.  The windshield had numerous gouges and rock chips in it which the dealership agreed they would repair for no charge.  The windshield repair shop declared the windshield un-repairable because it was a safety hazard due to several of the bad spots being in the drivers line of sight.  The dealership tried to get out of replacing the windshield but I refused to give into them.  After way too many phone calls to the dealership they finally agreed to replace the windshield if I would pay $300 towards the cost.  I agreed because I wanted this matter behind me and wanted my vehicle back. The dealership has had my car for three weeks now and still cannot tell me when I will get it back. 
To make this right the dealership should make the repairs correctly the first time instead of trying to lie to me about them.  I find it hard to believe the owner and general manager would agree to let unsafe vehicles be placed on road or let this total lack of customer service become the standard for their dealership.   
After this buying experience and the total lack of follow up care I would advise everyone  not to buy a car from this dealership.  They have had plenty of time and chances  to make this right and all they want to do is argue and pass the buck.

244,"October 23, 2015","I just purchased my second Audi from DFW Audi. That alone is enough to reccomend someone visit this dealership....

My sales person Luis Melendez is one of the best, he knows Audi vehicles inside and out. If you want to deal with professionals, DFW Audi is the place. ",5.0
245,"October 17, 2015","I have been a customer of DFW Audi for 9 years now.  I have taken 2 of my other cars there for service.  We were in the market for an extra vehicle to leave in a different state for the winter.  It needed to be AWD and, being an Audi guy, I instantly thought Audi.  I shopped around at some other options, including the other german car company.  Didn't see anything that struck my fancy.  While my wife's car was in for service (which is another issue, but the shop made matters right there), I noticed a 2008 S6 for sale.  I discussed the matter with sales and purchased the vehicle, local texas one owner that had been serviced in the shop.  I am not normally the person that purchases from a dealer without having another place look at it, but the shop I take our other vehicles to vouched for it, right?  I even spoke to the mechanic about it.  Little did I know...

Flash forward 3 weeks and less than 500 miles later.  The airbag light came on as I was driving down the road.  The next morning, the low coolant light came on.   I did some research on the forums and discovered the coolant light was most likely a known issue with these vehicles, where they develop a fracture in the coolant tank, around 50K.

I take the car in to see the rep and she informed me it was, as I feared, a problem with the coolant reservoir.  The airbag light was a crush sensor.  All told, the cost was ~$1000.00.  She and I discussed my opinion that there should be some consideration for the fact that I just purchased the vehicle from them, AFTER being serviced by them.  While I understand if there was not notice of the airbag light, the coolant issue DEFINITELY should have been noticed.  She informed me she would speak to the manager and get back to me.  One day later, I hadn't heard, so I called the following morning.  She informed me the manager said there wasn't anything they would do for me.  The parts could be in on Friday, but I would have to pay full parts and labor.  I told her that wasn't acceptable and that I would like the general manager's name so I could write a letter.  She responded and told me she would just transfer me to the general manager.  I left a voicemail expressing my dissatisfaction with the issue and the treatment and that I would appreciate a call back.  That was Wednesday.  I heard nothing from he nor anyone else from the Dealer.  I was supposed to be driving the vehicle on Thursday out of state to work on-site on Friday and house it there for the winter.  I had to purchase a last-minute airfare, as it was evident the vehicle would not be ready.  I called the rep again on Thursday morning; she apologized and said she wished there was something she could do and she would try to track down someone to talk with me.  I informed her that if I didn't hear anything, I would have to return the loaner in the afternoon and consider taking my business elsewhere.  I stopped in at 2:30PM Thursday, spoke to the rep in person and had her ready the car.  She informed me that the service manager was traveling from Atlanta but should be back on Friday.  I told her that would be fine and that I could speak with him on Friday.  Friday came and went, no contact from anyone at the dealer.  STILL no contact from the general manager.  I would expect at least a call to acknowledge my concern, even if he couldn't do anything for me.  

I hardly ever leave negative reviews, but this is inexcusable behavior.  As a business owner myself, I run my business with the opinion that customer satisfaction should be my primary indicator of success.  It baffles the mind that this dealership doesn't grasp that.  At a minimum, I am sure they made more than the cost of these repairs on the vehicle.  Beyond that, this is unethical - they certainly knew of the coolant issue.  If I wanted this response, I would have gone to a buy here, pay here lot.  Furthermore, I have been a customer of theirs for nearly a decade!  I won't be servicing my vehicles or purchasing my vehicles from this dealer again!",1.0

248,"August 25, 2015","I recently bought a car from this dealer and I was thoroughly disappointed with their lack of professionalism and service. Though I went around 2 pm and made decision to buy a car around 5 pm, they made us wait until 11 pm before I was called in to complete the paper work. 

Firstly, the salesman was too busy talking to other potential customers and as soon as we made the decision to buy a car, he was not to be seen. Ideally, the entire process should have gotten over around 6.30 pm or sooner. But we saw people who came after us were leaving before us. When I enquired around 7 pm as to why were waiting for so long, they asked us to have our dinner and come back. They were insensitive to the fact that we have been there for a long time and my kids (4 and 7 years) were getting restless and did not do anything about it. When I completed the entire process, it was close to midnight and I was the last person to leave. It is insane that they would make us wait for 6 hours even after I told them that I was going to give them a check for my purchase.

A couple of days later I got a call from them asking me to come in to sign a document for the car I traded-in. Since they missed it, I refused to drive 40 miles and asked them to mail the documents, which they finally did.

I currently have the Audi corporate office investigating the situation as well as a complaint with the Better Business Bureau (DFW Audi has a 'C' rating by the way due to numerous complaints), and a report filed with the Euless Police Department for the theft.

272,"June 05, 2014","Over two years ago in September 2011 we got a break from the corporate world and were fond unemployed with an opportunity to start over again, to start as small business owners. At that time we had a small German economy car and needed something bigger for our business so we went to the dealership to see how bit was the biggest SUV...not big enough, however, the representative kept us in mind and soon enough we received his call to come over because they had received a used truck that would be able to handle what we required for our small business.
Two years later a week ago our business is thriving, however, my wife from Brooklyn N.Y. wanted to start driving again, wanted a small car for getting around on her free time. We looked at all sorts of small cars, however her eyes were fixed on the cute new Fiat Sport Hatchback Coup.
Two weeks ago we are in WallMart and run into the guy who sold us the truck. After small talk we mentioned that we had our eyes on small cars, perhaps a Mini Cooper or a Fiat. He said that he was now at the Audi Dealership off 183 in Bedford. That we should look at the TT Sports, a very good car he said.
A week ago today our friend called us and said the dealership had received a used Fiat and that we should go take a look at it. We were instantly convinced that was the car for my wife, everything was exactly as we could handle including a very good price. That same day we put the necessary funds to hold the car, came back the next day and finalized the paperwork. What, no going back and forth, no negotiating, no hours on hours waiting on the deal to go through? No, instead our experience was similar to when we purchased the truck because the representative paid keen attention to our wants and needs. He was honest, no pressure, friendly and trustworthy. Our next car? If the dealership is the same Audi, that is a major plus because the environment and support staff was superb. However, without our friend Luis Melendez, the whole experience would have never culminated to the best car buying experience ever, hence, our heavy and high props to Luis Melendez and to Audi for allowing the experience to happen.

281,"January 15, 2014","I stopped into the Ballinger DFW Audi Dealership on Monday, January 13th, 2014. I was approached by Scott Bibb who asked what he could help me with. I explained to him that I found two cars on Auto Trader that I would like to check out before bringing my husband back on the weekend to view and potentially purchase. I told him that my husband is the type of man that likes to get in and get out, and I’m trying to make this a quick process by weeding out the two vehicles.  His response was a blank stare, which I was confused by. Most car salesmen I’ve dealt with in the past are so eager and anxious to make a sale; they usually won’t let you get a word in.
 So, I went on to tell him that I’ve always owned a SUV, but I had a “spark” the other day to check into sedans.  He snapped back at me, “I don’t understand what you mean by spark”. I was a little taken back by his tone, so I tried to reiterate that I had an (idea?) that maybe a sedan would be more suitable. I then went on to say that my husband wants me to drive a “mom car”. He immediately cut me off and literally said, “I don’t know what you’re talking about. I don’t know what a mom car is. Get to the point. What cars do you want to look at”? 
I was dumbfounded. I felt my jaw drop open. I have never, in my entire 26 years, been spoken to (by a salesperson, mind you) in that manner.  I finally processed the situation and snapped back, telling him there were two A4’s that I wanted to look at, but if he has something better to do, or if this is a waste of his time, I will gladly take my business elsewhere. He then let out a chuckle, like this was so hilarious to him and said, “Let me find someone else to help you”. He walked over to a group of 4-5 men, all propped up against a cubicle, and I couldn’t make out exactly what he said, but he pointed at me, shook his head and rolled his eyes. 
A man named Luis walked over to me, shook my hand, apologized for Mr. Bibb’s actions and asked what he could help me with, but obviously the damage was already done. I told Luis that I will take my business elsewhere and walked out the door. 
I am utterly disgusted and appalled by Scott Bibb’s attitude and manner. I can honestly say that I’ve never met such a vile human being. I know for a fact that he would not have spoken to my husband or father in any such way. I have pondered for days, wondering why this man spoke to me with such disregard. Was the commission on a $25,000 used car not going to be enough to treat me with any respect? Was my 2010 Jeep Commander sitting in the parking lot not “fancy” enough to take me seriously? I hope that this review has some sort of repercussion. No one should ever get away with speaking to an innocent, potential customer with such hatred. 
All in all, stay clear of the Ballinger DFW Audi Dealership. But if you must go there to purchase a vehicle, absolutely stay clear of Scott Bibb. That awful man doesn’t deserve a dime.

When I did meet him to make the purchase, he was cordial, professional and efficient.  After my purchase, he met me in my city with a loan car so my accessories could be added to my car.  When I got my car back it had a full tank of gas, had been washed and the blind spot monitors had been adjusted, as he said they seemed a little off to him.  I have Scott's cell phone number and he has encouraged me to call him if I need anything, including bringing me a loan car for any AudiCare service (I live in a different city than the dealership).

283,"September 24, 2013","In the past, my husband and I have always done business with a different dealership and got what I thought was good customer service until compared to yours.  When it came time to purchase a new vehicle I proceeded to do some research and pick the “best” car for me.  Audi was our first stop.  Benjamin met us with a smile and was extremely patient when I asked the ton of questions that I had.  And, didn’t even complain about my test driving the vehicle and again the barrage of questions.  So, my husband was ready to purchase on the spot, but, I wanted to be sure so we went on to drive a few other vehicles.  Benjamin was very understanding and even encouraged me to drive the others and said we would be back…. And he was right.  So after being basically ignored at BMW and disappointed in the infinite vehicles, we headed back to purchase my favorite car I have ever owned.  We were in a rush to get back to Abilene that evening for kid stuff and again Benjamin went completely out of his way.  His customer service is exceptional but we were again surprised at every person at the dealership had such great customer service.  We were always greeted and offered a drink.  

During the check out process we purchased the tinting option.  And, there were a couple of dings on the car that you were going to touch up.  This probably would normally such an ordeal but we are 150+ miles away.  Benjamin kept in contact with me to schedule the tint and the paint touch up.  We finally worked it out of when we could be there and scheduled it.  Benjamin assured me we would have a loaner and could just spend our day in the metroplex.  He asked us to have the vehicle at the dealership by 8:30 on Saturday morning.  On Thursday he called me and asked if it would be a problem to have it there by 7:30 instead.  We were not planning on coming until Saturday morning, but decided to come on down Friday night.  I told Benjamin we would get it there Saturday morning.  So, this is where I was blown away.  Benjamin said, let me just come by the hotel and bring you a loaner on Friday night and take your vehicle so that we would not have to get up and around early.  And, true to his word, he met us in downtown Fort Worth with a loaner.  Now, I know he was already off work and should have been home with his family.  But, not only did he bring us a car but also answered some questions that I had about operations of the car.    When we picked up our car that afternoon he again asked if there was anything he could do or questions that we had.  

I expected good customer service when he was trying to sell me something, but, anticipated it to end there.  Wow, was I wrong.  You have made a lifetime customer of us.  I just wanted you to know what exceptional customer service we received and that we think Benjamin is FANTASTIC!

285,"September 06, 2013","I have been an Audi owner for six years.  I purchased my 2007 A4 from this dealership and my 2010 A4 from Audi of Plano.  I was recently in the market for an upgrade, so I contacted DFW Audi. I asked the very nice receptionist to please give me a great salesman.  Fortunately for me, Scott Bibb took my call.  He answered all of my questions, gave me the best offer for my trade-in, and got me in a wonderful A4.  He even did most of the purchase process over the phone since we live an hour away.  Then the next evening, Scott met us halfway, and we signed all of the paperwork.  No one has ever offered to do this for us!  That was AMAZING customer service.

This was definitely the BEST car buying experience my husband and I have ever had!  Not only is my A4 amazing, but the actual purchasing process was flawless.  It's never been that easy, and it was all because of Scott.  I love my car, and Scott is our new Audi salesman for life.

I took my vehicle in for a repair and when I got my vehicle back the engine cover was missing, there were bolts missing from the engine and the ignition coil caps were all cracked.  They basically called me a liar and told me the car was brought in this way.  If you take your car there, you better take before pictures!  I wonder what else is missing that I can't see.",1.8
287,"June 21, 2013","After my car was hit by an inattentive driver, it was totaled by the insurance company and I found myself looking for a replacement.  After scouring numerous websites, I located a car that met my requirements at DFW Audi.  I was looking at a pre-owned car and its Carfax report indicated it had a previous damage that had been repaired.  This was likely one reason the price was fairly reasonable.

GOOD:
The salesman was very helpful and spent time with me without making me feel pressured.  They went beyond my request and had the hood repainted to address some stone chips (I just asked for it to be touched up).  They also swapped out a front license plate bracket so it would match the car’s exterior finish.  The dealership is also moving closer to my home, which should be helpful come service-time.

NEEDS IMPROVEMENT:
From the customer’s perspective, the whole “let me talk it over with my sales manager” always seems like a gimmick to keep you in the dealership longer.  Even if that’s not true, the customer should be able to do the final negotiation with the sales manager (if indeed there is any actual negotiation going on).  Cars and homes are the only purchases where it is extremely complicated.  Yes, these are big-ticket items, but the whole process needs to be streamlined.

Even thought the care was sold ""As IS"", there should have been some disclosure about what items/systems needed repairs.  Immediately upon picking up the car, I noticed two faulty electrical switches .  Not major, but annoying nonetheless.  Another minor point was the car only came with a single electronic key - no spare or emergency key - requiring me to buy a replacement.

Again, from the customer’s perspective, the finance manager experience seems to be an opportunity for upselling.  Gone are the days of “undercoating”, only to be replaced by extended warranties, dent/ding repair, etc.  Some of these are worth it if you are going to keep the car longer than usual, but others are add-ons that can be purchased at anytime.  Since I was buying outright (no financing) and had no trade, the rest of the transaction was uncomplicated.

BOTTOM-LINE:
I give 4 stars across the board to DFW Audi for the purchase experience, although there is room for improvement.  Five stars would be a phenomenal experience and I just don’t know any dealer (around here anyway) that would qualify for that.  I’ve not yet gone through the service experience, but I expect it to be without incident.",4.0

289,"July 09, 2012","In general auto dealerships do not like to do business with educated buyers as they make decisions with their head versus the emotional buyer who pay any price for what they want. They would rather you just pay the price listed. I did a lot of research and even spoke with an auto broker friend of mine to determine fair value on a used vehicle dfw audi has had on their lot for many months. Additionally, I got help in determining what fair value was for my trade, a Lexus GS 450h. The dealership offered me $1k less than carmax for my trade, lol. Okay, not a deal breaker because these things are negotiated to find a middle where the deal is acceptable for both parties. I asked to see the invoice on the dealer's vehicle to determine an acceptable premium I was willing to pay. I was told no. So you see where this is going I am sure... They offer less than wholesale for your trade and expect retail value on theirs. Now is a good time to mention that the dealerships vehicle had a Carfax which showed it was bought at a wholesale auction and had been in a front end collision. The dealership acted surprised I was aware of that minor detail. I told them to keep the car, I obviously was not the right buyer. Bottom line is do your homework, no need to over pay for a car with the competition they are against from others in the industry. Avoid this dealership. Regards",3.0

From day 1, they have all treated me with great customer service and were eager to sell a car that suited my budget needs.  The drive from Dallas to Euless is the only disadvantage - but you can ask for a loaner car!  And within certain time frames, you can leave your car there for maintenance while they take you to DFW airport!  I got a great Audi A4 (still love it today -even beyond the warranty period), have great service experiences, and they offer loaner cars while my car is having an 'operated'.  My only disappointment is that my service consultant Kyle was promoted to manager of the new Fort-Worth location, but I think his replacement is gonna be just fine.  I am a female and have had very disappointing experiences with other manufacturer dealerships but DFW Audi has always been  respectful and straightforward.  Do not expect fluff services or cars with silly gadgets that do not matter in the long run.  Instead expect an Audi built with quality, long lasting style and performance - and the service personnel to stand behind the relationship.

I got there pretty early on a Saturday morning so I thought I would immediately get some help. Well after about 20 minutes outside, a salesman came to talk to me.  He was busy at the moment, but he went to get someone(Angie) to help me. Angie is relatively new to car sales which was refreshing, but it made negotiations slow as the Sales Manager was really controlling things. Long story, I got the car I wanted which was a pre-owned.  I never felt like DFW Audi was customer service oriented even though Angie tried.  My CPO only came with one key(I didn't get my CPO inspection until a week after. This stated that 3 keys were inspected) I have a call into Audi of America for that issue. I also got the run around on getting a user's manual set. Audi of America is looking into that as well. Again, I feel like Angie is not at fault, but she doesn't have any experience and her leadership doesn't appear to want to lead or help. I was pitched on a ""Ceramic tint"" as being the best and worth the 500 dollars that I would be paying.  The tint turns out to not be ceramic which feels like a bait and switch, but I'm not going to even complain about that. My CPO is due for it's next service so I took it to another dealership to possibly get a service package and was told that I have a service package on my vehicle from the previous owner!  Well that's great news, but had I not inquired about it, I would not have known. Maybe DFW Audi sells so many cars that they don't think about providing a level of customer service for the little people.  I might use their service dept. as they seem very nice and knowledgable, but I won't buy from them again.  I doubt Angie stays there long. ",3.0
303,"August 29, 2011","Where to start.  So I purchased a used Audi A4 with hail damage on it on the premises that they would take the car back in to get it repaired.  Well after calling to get it scheduled because they ""hail guys"" were so backed up I was able to finally get my car into the dealership for repair and was able to get a smaller then my car loaner car.  I was told over the phone that it would take 3-5 days to get the car fixed.  Low and behold 2 weeks later I had to call and ask where my car was? I was told that it was just now (2 weeks later) taken by the hail guys to fix it.  Well what was suppose to be a 3-5 day job took another 2 weeks all in between I was the one calling to get a check up on my car.  Well the day finally came when I got my car back from the dealership and when I was driving it home I heard a thump noise coming in from the trunk so when I got home I looked in the trunk and say that the hail guys did not put the trunk cover back in right so it fell apart. They never put back the wire covers on the trunk hinges nor the emeregency release tab in the trunk.  Looking around the car more I realized that 2 of my 4 hand grips in the cab and now perminently hanging down, my sun roof cover was so tightly shut I had to use 2 hands to pull it back so I could open the sunroof to make sure they did not mess that up and also my rear tail light on the rear view window was falling down.  I realized that they had to take the car apart to fix the hail damage but at least put it back together again right!  And now that the sun was finally setting I could see that they missed hail damaged spots on my car.  When I called I was told that they would schedule me a time to get everything refixed. Well, I never heard so I called back only to find out my sales rep Orlando went to work for the Fort Worth branch so I spoke to Ron and he said that yes the couldn't fix all the spots for the hail (excuse me but, didn't you have hail damage repair people fix it?) but they will fix the cosmetic parts and that he will ""call me back""  Well needless to say that was a week and a half ago and after I left another message to him this past weekend letting him know how dissatisfied I was with their services I still have not heard from him.

I just happened to find this dealers name online since they do not advertise that much and are somewhat 'hidden' away near the intersection of 121 and 183 in Euless.

While on the way to yet ANOTHER dealer (had been to 5 mfg's dealers so far) I called and spoke to Orlando - NICE guy - very personable and had the car I THOUGHT my wife might like, so we stopped in...

Luck would have it, they had just gotten in a hard to find (not pre-sold) black on black Q5 turbo with 95% of the equipment we would have ordered.

We actually had to wait in line to drive it as it was very popular !

The wife drove it, liked it, and while there I looked on my tablet for reviews/pricing and found some areas were actually paying above MSRP !!!

I have a syndrome that does not allow me to do that and right away the sales team offered a discount I was happy with and an offer on a trade in sight unseen.... 

We drove it home that Sat night with the promise of completing the sale Monday afternoon. Got a call Monday from David that there was some difficulty with the credit bureaus having disparate ratings for my wife, but he was working to clear it up.

They went to bat for us with Audi and knocked another $500 off the car for the 'drama' .

I highly recommend this group and suspect the future service will be as good !

Orlando is going to my wife's work today to give her a loaner so they can detail the car for her and since we opted to prepay the maintenance, they offer a valet service and loaner cars - Looking forward to great service from them !

306,"December 27, 2010","It seems that old cliche about car dealerships being extremely friendly and helpful up until the point of sale is most true about DFW Audi.  I recently had my Infiniti G37 totaled in an accident and was in the short term market for a new car.  After exhaustive research, I finally came to the conclusion that an Audi for me.  I did some homework about the DFW area Audi dealerships and visited all of them.  

Before the sale, the sales team was very gracious and accomodating, staying ""late"" to help me finalize the purchase of my new 2011 A5...it also helped that they had exactly what I was looking for on their lot (the other dealerships had offered to order it in for me)...it was fine until the paperwork.  

The finance manager is a WEASEL, he manipulated the numbers and forced me to purchase my tag and title through DFW Audi...of course, I didn't notice this until after I had signed the papers...MY FAULT.

With the vehicle, I purchased a ceramic tint package which I was led to believe was done by the dealership or Audi...it is not, although I am satisfied with the tint job, I could have very easily forgone the dealerships BS and gone directly to the tint shop myself.

That being said, I accidentally left my toll tag and insurance papers in the loan vehicle (an older model A4...really, DFW Audi? I give you a brand new A5 and you put me in a older model A4?) and was promised that it would be mailed to me.  After 2 weeks had passed and no package from Audi, I called and was assured that it would be sent overnight delivery that day.  Another 2 weeks passed and I called to check on my toll tag once again, they somehow LOST my toll tag and insurance card.  I accepted their offer to just have them send me a check for the lost tag charge that the NTTA would charge me for the cancellation...ANOTHER 2 weeks passed and STILL NO delivery from DFW Audi.  I called to inquire and they said they must have sent to wrong address.  Funny thing about this is that I get all sorts of mailers from them as well as my monthly bill and they can't seem to figure out my address to send MY PROPERTY back to me? 

After 2 months of dealing with their lies and deception, I have given up on ever getting my property returned to me and will NEVER step foot in this dealership EVER again.

308,"May 22, 2006","I have exhausted all of my options through Baillargeon Audi and Audi USA customer service line over the course of the past five months. 

The A4 I was sold by Baillargeon Audi was Certified even though the vehicle was driven by an Audi employee in California as a fleet vehicle for 20,000 miles and a year and a half without obtaining the required oil change.  When I purchased the Certified A4 from Baillargeon Audi the Navigation system did not function because it was missing the Navigation CD. The CD was not provided to me for approximately two months after my purchase.
I was not notified of the maintenance deficiency of the vehicle prior to Baillargeon Audi selling it to me as a Certified vehicle.
Once I learned of the maintenance deficiency, Baillargeon Audi, and subsequently the Audi USA customer service representative, refused to contact the Audi employee to determine if the oil change was done at a non-Audi service station or offer any other solution to my concern.

After the salesperson and I agreed on a price for the vehicle, and I had already purchased a plane ticket to travel from Colorado to Texas to take possession of the A4, he told me the A4 Navigation system did not have a CD, therefore, it did not operate. He assured me he would get a CD for it soon, if not by the time I arrived to pick up the car. I did not receive the Navigation CD for almost two months after I purchased the Certified A4.

When I obtained approximately 35,000 miles I took my A4 to McDonald Audi in Denver, Colorado to have the oil changed. Without prompting, the service advisor advised me that Audi service computer database displayed that my A4 has only received the following two oil changes: Oil Change at 9,000 miles on July 22, 2003 Oil Change at 28,000 miles on October 23, 2004 at Baillargeon Audi, Dallas, TX

Therefore, my Audi was likely driven for 19,000 miles and 15 months without an oil change; well beyond Audi maintenance recommendations, prior to its sale to me. With this knowledge readily available to the Baillargeon Audi Service Manager, Baillargeon Audi ""Certified"" my A4 anyway and failed to bring it to my attention.

In my letter I expressed to Shad Warren my obvious concern that I was sold a ""Certified"" A4 that was driven for almost 20,000 miles and a year and a half without an oil change. 

I received a response letter from Baillargeon Audi manager Laura Davis on November 14, 2005 in which she failed to provide me with any remedies to my expressed concern about the lapse of oil changes on my A4.   She also wrote, ""...it is impossible for us to determine whether or not an oil change was performed between the 9K and 28K mileage interval."" I purchased a title search for my car from California DMV and determined my A4 was owned by Volkswagen Corp.

I purchased this A4 from an Audi dealership for the reasons I outlined earlier and expected to keep the car for sometime, hopefully beyond the expiration of the Certified warranty period, but because I now know an Audi employee failed to properly maintain the car, I have serious concerns about my A4 suffering from serious engine mechanical failure sometime after the conclusion of my current warranty. I feel taken advantage of by Baillargeon Audi, specifically their Certification of a car that should not have been on an Audi lot to begin with. Secondly, they failed to address or rectify any of my legitimate concerns. Audi USA ended up giving me a free oil change for my concerns!! Wow - $40 bucks from a luxury car manufacture and dealership. Stay away from Baillargeon Certified used cars, they dont check them and dont care if your displeased with the purchase. No customer service, they flat out did not care.

309,"December 27, 2005","I purchased my new A4 from Austin since none of the dealers in the DFW area had one with the options I needed.

University Park Audi & Boardwalk in Dallas were extremely rude and I couldn't help but feel that they were peddling used fords. Baillargeon folks were very nice but they just didn't have what I was looking for. The only reason I provide this background is to disclose that the car was NOT purchased at Baillargeon Audi. Regardless of this they have treated me as if I had purchased my car from them.

The car had some initial issues, the idiots in Austin had not taken the spacers out of the car, the alignment was off, and finally, the credit card tray was jammed shut within the first week of use. I decided to take it in to Baillargeon to address the alignment and credit-card tray issues.

I was provided with a loaner for three days, and they fixed everything. The jammed tray had to be ordered for which I had to come back. Turns out my wife had put a wad of dollar bills in there and perhaps forced the tray shut, thus causing the jam. I had not known this, but Scott was very nice and polite in pointing this out. They should have charged me for this as it clearly was not a warrantee issue and yet they provided this service free of charge.

Even though they are 40 miles away from where I live I will be taking my car there for service going forward. I cannot recommend these guys enough.
