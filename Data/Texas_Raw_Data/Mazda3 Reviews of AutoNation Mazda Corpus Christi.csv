0,"December 04, 2017",Service department with no longer return my phone calls answer or my emails. From what I hear from a good source is that the service manager will run and hide to avoid people that she doesn't want to deal with. Never ever again will I deal with this dealership.,1.0
1,"December 18, 2016","Horrible experience with service department. Our service tech was great, but we had our 2010 Mazda CX-7 towed there when it died on the road. After 1 week of the mechanic ""looking at it"" and on the phone with Mazda because he could find any specific thing wrong with it, we were told 2 days before we were moving out of state that the engine was bad and needed a $10,000 new engine, but no reason why the engine could go bad in a 6 year old car. Needless to say we left the car there and borrowed a family members car while we moved and figured out what to do with our now useless Mazda 13 hours away. We found a mechanic here in New Mexico willing to look at it if we could get it here. We paid a towing company $800 to have it shipped here and guess what..... THE MECHANIC HERE PUT THE ENGINE BACK TOGETHER, REPLACED THE BATTERY AND THE CAR STARTED RIGHT UP. Nothing else done to it. PERIOD. So then we also had to pay this mechanic another $900 down the drain. We have called asking for answers and our diagnostic fee back $250 and cannot get an answer or reply to our messages. What if we listened to your mechanic and replaced the engine or bought the new car you were pushing on us?? We want answers and our money back. You hurt our family in a major way when we were vulnerable and did not have anything to spare and put a family member in a bind by lending us a car for 2 months, put bad marks on our credit because they automatically tried putting us in a brand new car upside down and ran our credit at least 6 times each. $2000+ in the hole because a mechanic relied on a bulletin and hurt us on acquiring our new home.... Thanks Autonation. :-(",1.0
2,"August 11, 2011","When looking for a new 2011 Mazda 6, this was the only local dealership around.  We were planning on paying cash for the whole thing.  They had the color we wanted, but we wanted some extras.  We were told that once we put down a deposit, it would be 24-28 hours until it was done.  This was on a Friday, where we paid a $9000 deposit, and made arrangements for a bank deposit for the remainder on Monday.  We finalized the papers and left. After that, it was like we didn't exist.  We had to call on Monday only to find out that the parts had to be ordered, and that it would take 3 days to come in.  When we called on Thursday, we were told that they only ordered parts on Thursdays, so they had only just ordered the parts, and it takes 7 days to get them in.  We decided to take delivery of the car so we would have something to drive while waiting for the parts.  The following Thursday I called to see if the parts had come in, and no one could tell us anything.  They said they'd call back within the hour.  Not hearing anything the rest of that day, I called back on Friday and demanded to speak to someone in charge, who finally informed me that the parts had come in that morning, and we made arrangements to come in the following Monday to get the spoiler, radio, and Auto-Dimming rear-view mirror installed.  At the 8am drop-off, I was told it would be ready by 3pm.  At 4:30pm I called, only to find out they would have to take the car elsewhere to have the radio installed, but that the mirror and spoiler were ready.  The following day, I called at 3pm to ask about the radio.  They told me the radio was done, but that the mirror had yet to be installed (even though they claimed it had been installed the day before), and that it would take 4 hours to install the mirror. After some very terse words with the manager, I was guaranteed that the car would be ready at 10:30am the next morning.  Finally, the following day we were able to pick up the car.

I understand that they are trying to make a sale, but it was almost as if we didn't even exist anymore after they got our money.  All we got were lies and excuses.  I will never do business with them again, even for an oil change.  I have told all my friends, and recommend to anyone in the Corpus Christi, TX area who is shopping for a Mazda: GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.
