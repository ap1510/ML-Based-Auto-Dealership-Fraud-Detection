0,"August 24, 2019","I never owned a VW before and I've never been to this dealer before. I came in on a Saturday and the experiance went by with ease. The salesman was great. Not pushy at all, very smart on the car (Atlas) and just a nice dude. Not only was the price right, but he helped us set up appointments for the following week to get purchased items installed. Contacting him after the sale was easy and I never felt like I was bothering him. 

I've owned Fords, Hondas and Kias and this was the best sales experience I've ever had.",5.0
1,"March 17, 2019",Identified and bought/financed a car on the web from them. All that needed to be done was test drive and sign papers. The salesman seemed uninterested in my business although all he had to do was sit in the back seat for the test drive for the car as already sold and try to act cheerful. Once that was done turned over to finance which was pleasant enough. Once complete in that department he called the intercom for the salesman to come and deliver the car. He never showed so I went back to his desk and found the keys on his desk and went looking for the car I had just purchased. Found the car after 10 minutes or so and drove home. I guess he did not make enough money on the deal and lost interest. Once home I called XM to activate radio and was told someone at the dealership had activated it and I needed to get them to deactivate it if I wanted service. I wont even bother. Needless to say I will not be back.,1.6
2,"March 29, 2014","If you are looking for a dealership that treats you with trust and respect, North Park is the place to go.  Throughout the buying process they were efficient, knowledgeable and easy to work with.  They are sincere when they commit to your happiness as a customer and they go to great lengths to listen and care for you in a reasonable way.   When it comes to communication they are clear but not pushy and they are willing to acknowledge the individual needs and preferences of each customers.  They were quick to respond to service requests, took care of loaner car arrangements, and made it enjoyable to buy a new car :).",5.0
3,"July 15, 2013","Easiest car buying experience I bought twice! First) I was in the market for a new car. My Saab was starting to have problems and I knew it was time for something different. I am the kind of person that like eclectic cars and was interested in the CC. When I went to North Park I was immediately greeted with a smile by Miggy. She wasn't the traditional sales person, and I appreciated that. She walked me over to the only used CC and I was sold on it immediately. I wasn't able to take it that day so I put down a deposit, and thought about my purchase for a week. When i went back to sign the final paperwork I wasn't as impressed with it so i decided to withdrawal my offer. Miggy told me that it wouldn't be a problem, but she had another offer. A brand new 2013 CC that had just come off the truck. I was worried about the price, but she told me not to worry. She was able to drop the price for me $8,000! Then the finance department got me an unbelievable rate through VW Credit. I was the happiest with a car I've ever been!
Second) 6 months later we were in the market for a car for my son. I found a Toyota Corolla online that was a bit out of my price range but i decided to go in and see what deal I could get. Miggy wasn't there so Malcom helped us. He was so eager to sell us a car that he took $1,500 off sticker and delivered the car to us that evening!!! A shout out the Glen in the Finance Department! He cut our interest rate in half and worked  deal on the warranty. This is the best dealership I've ever been to! ",5.0
