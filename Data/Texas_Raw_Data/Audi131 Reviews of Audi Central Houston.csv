0,"May 17, 2020","I inquired on a car shown on-line via internet messaging.  Less than 10 mins later I had a response and better price than shown on-line! To top that, it was Saturday around 4:50pm!  The sales person Paul Hernandez even commented that he would be available Sunday for any questions, wow!  We worked out a deal and with home delivery (thanks COVID-19!) for a new A7 and even an agreeable trade-in value by the following week Tuesday!

Due to Paul being off the next day, sales person Chris Hall jumped in to finalize everything and kept me updated during the entire process!  I asked him to advise when he was delivering the car to me and he did that plus showed up on the time he said!  Brought all the paperwork, clearly explained everything, we signed everything in my garage and then he spent time showing me my new A7 including many features.  He even told me to call him anytime for any support!  He stayed to ensure I was happy and then drove back my trade-in. 

Dawn Villarreal in finance helped me meet my financing needs and was able to get me great financing setup.  She was patient explaining everything as well as answer all my questions.

Few days go by and I had a few issues, Paul was on vacation and Chris was tied up, so Sales Mgr James Watts jumped in to handle everything.  James worked with me to ensure all my issues were handled and stayed on top of everything.  Everything he told me he would do, he did! Very respectful, honest and made it happen. 

My first experience with Audi Central Houston... Kudo's to all four of them for taking care of me as well as getting me into my new A7 Prestige to enjoy!  Great teamwork, great people, great place to do business with!  They have earned my business and respect! 

BTW - I noticed constant sanitizing, face masks, gloves and proper social distancing to meet COVID-19 requirements!

Sincerely,
Albert G.",5.0

There was add-on after add-on including stamping an ID # in 4 places on the vehicles, insurance that I don’t need since I have my on insurance, putting a coating on the vehicle. This is year old car.

4,"February 25, 2019","When I found that Audi Central Houston had the vehicle of my dreams, the only dealer to have the exact one in the state I should add, I started researching the online reviews to check them out.  Now that I have that dream vehicle, I would like to contribute my own glowing review to the many others which brought me from Austin to Houston for one of the smoothest car purchases I've ever experienced.  

Paul Hernandez was a pleasure to work with.  He was professional, attentive, and transparent throughout the entire process.  From start to finish, including a 30 min test drive, we completed the deal in about three hours.  And that was on a gorgeous Saturday with a ton of other shoppers in the showroom.  Michael in F\I was also very personable and helped us navigate the final purchase details without pressure.  The vehicle was immaculately prepped by the support team and the drive back to Austin was a blast. 

Thanks to the team at Audi Central Houston, we'll be making that same trip back to Houston when it comes time for our next Audi.  ",5.0
5,"February 22, 2019","Yuri has been my sales agent at Audi Central through several different vehicles.  He has always been easily available and has endeavored to make my experience as easy as possible.  I have felt very comfortable being able to rely on him for support.  
Service has also been superb.  Flor sent an Audi service agent out once when there were problems with my key not unlocking my vehicle.
Two of my siblings have purchased cars from Yuri as well.
Lenny was wonderful reviewing the new aspects of my car.",5.0

8,"February 01, 2019","I took my out it AAL into the dealership for a scheduled check up and was told it would take 2 hours to complete. So I decided to wait. 3 and a 1/2 hours later I inquired as to the status of the job. I was told the car was ready and  , when it appeared, it was completely dry after having been washed. My service agent couldn't find the paperwork for the car, so just gave me the keys and waved me good bye. It's been  4 days and I still haven't received the paperwork. In short, a less than exceptional experience.",3.2

13,"December 12, 2018","Getting service at Audi Central was truly an outstanding experience. Driving into the dealership in the early morning, I was immediately greeted and checked in, As I approached Jack Busche's desk, he welcomed me and got me situated in a loaner Q5. He explained the normal maintenance to be performed and service updates to be installed. Before leaving in the loaner, I stopped by the coffee bar and enjoyed fine coffee with a snack. Upon my return latter afternoon, I expeditiously checked in the loaner and proceeded to Jack's desk. He enthusiastically walked me through the work done and escorted me to my car and extended a warm ""Happy Holidays"" good bye. The wife and I are thoroughly enjoying our Q5 and I dare say that the service rendered by Jack and his support team was superb. ",5.0

16,"November 06, 2018",Audi Central Houston has an excellent service department.  I would suggest calling a service advisor directly however. When I booked directly through the service reservation line with someone it was always either misbooked or did not relay what I needed to do.  I worked directly with James (an excellent service advisor who was on top of the service I needed as well as keeping me informed of the service progress).,4.8

21,"August 07, 2018","i have been looking for a used honda crv for 8 months. thousands of cars reviewed. dozens of dealerships visited. audi central is the lowest price for an used vehicle. they have the least amount of days on the lot for used cars in texas. the car was perfect. the process was seamless and time efficient. they sent the shuttle to pick me up. gased the venicle and cleaned it again. it is spotless.

the coffee is fabulous. the nut bars to die for. Matt and J.T. great. spoke honestly with me in order to assist me in making a decision.

i will definitely buy another used vehicle from audi central. thank you matt and J.T. i love my 2006 honda crv.

i do not buy cars because of the adversion to dealerships. audi central is like visiting relatives. relaxed and there for you.  I loved it!!!!!",5.0
22,"June 19, 2018","I was pretty satisfied with the service provided by Audi Central until my recent experience with service advisor Jack. The whole experience was so bad that I won’t go to Audi central any more. I scheduled a 25k service on May 31st with Jack at 11:30am, I arrived at 11:25am but he was not at his desk and other advisors couldn’t find him either. I had to wait until 11:45 and he finally showed up without any apologies. He told me the service would be done in one and half hour so he couldn't provide a loaner for me. That was fine. I told him I could either pick up the car before 3pm or after 6pm. He promised that the maintenance can be done at 2pm and he didn't mention anything about shuttle service operation hours. Around 4pm, he sent me a message saying the car is ready to pick up and I asked him to schedule a shuttle service for me around 6pm. He told me the shuttle service stops at 5pm (Later on, I learned that shuttle service actually stops at 5:45pm form another advisor!!). I asked him if it's possible for me to take Uber and get reimbursed (This is what Momentum BMW does when they cannot provide shuttle service). Suddenly, he stopped replying my message and didn't even answer my phone calls. Around 5:30pm, he finally said yes, he could reimburse Uber expense with a receipt and he told me I had to be there before 7pm as they are closed at 7pm sharp (The website shows they are closed at 8pm!!). When I got there and sent him the receipt, he told me he had to let his manager sign a form and then I could get a check in two weeks, which will be mailed from North Carolina. Now three weeks passed, I still don't receive the check yet. The whole experience with Jack was horrible, and I don't understand how a service advisor who keeps lying to customers can still work at Audi Central…",2.0
23,"May 20, 2018",I absolutely love my truck but this is like a bittersweet moment. I have had the truck almost thirty days and the brakes are squeaking like crazy. I decide to google squeaky brakes to confirm that normally means you need new brakes. I contact my salesman the first time he says all audi's do that so my question is how will I know when I need brakes?  I also asked about this crack in the headlamp which he responded that the scratch was not there on the pictures. My thing is in customer service someone has to take accountability which my salesman didn't. I was offered to come in and let them buff the scratch and then again Audi's have squeaky brakes and you have to do your research. I know there are policies in place and you don't normally sale cars in that condition but you are not perfect everyone makes mistakes. Fair warning if you are purchasing an Audi the brakes will squeak all audis do that and mind you I still haven't received my paperwork. But what does that matter I'm only the customer as long as they were paid it's not a problem. Only thing I will probably enjoy are the free carwashes!,2.0

27,"April 26, 2018","An absolute nightmare of an experience with this dealer. I'll keep it short and sweet: I buy a fair number of used luxury cars and understand that problems are expensive, but I do expect a dealer of this size to be professional and up-front about whatever issues a car might be experiencing, especially when they claim to have ""put it through a full CPO check and only can't call it Certified due to age."" So, when the 2nd cylinder misfires in the process of getting the car home, and when the first rainstorm leads to a drenching of the center console and the ruining of the MMI-related electronics, I'm going to be a little upset. To make matters worse, the used car manager did not return multiple voicemails, nor did my salesperson answer any texts. Repair bill touching $3k in the first week of ownership. Avoid at all costs.",2.2
28,"April 23, 2018","My service advisor, Alberto, was an hour late for my appointment. He was finishing up with another customer and did not even greet or approach me until an hour later.  Other than that, drop off and loaner pick up was smooth. He did use a personal cellphone to take pictures of my credit card and insurance info. I thought it was strange since my previous advisor used her iPad. The main issue I had was during pickup. Alberto called me the following day at 330pm and told me my car would be finished by 4 pm. I was not able to pick up my car that evening. Alberto did not like my response and throw out loaner policies with me. I did not appreciate the fact that Audi expects me to drop everything that I'm doing to return my loaner and pick up my car. ",2.6
29,"March 22, 2018","I took my A7 in for my 45,000 mile maintenance and it couldn't have been better.  Antoine was my service advisor; got me set up and into the shuttle with in 5-10 minutes. He kept me updated as promised and my car was ready virtually right at the time he had indicated when I dropped it off.  Car was washed and ready to go once I returned.  Flawless and hassle free experience.",4.8
30,"March 05, 2018","Over the years I must admit I have avoided ""dealer maintenance"" due to concerns over cost and them prescribing too many unnecessary repairs.  We purchased a Certified Pre-Owned A4 S-Line and decided to go with the inhouse service at Audi Central.  The best decision ever since the car is wonderful, the service is priced fairly for what they are doing, and the professionalism and customer service are second to none.  ",5.0
31,"February 20, 2018","Never have been to a dealership of this caliber.  Even if you live 2-3 hrs away and have other Audi Dealerships closer, go to Audi of Central Houston.  I spent time in 4 different Audi Dealership, none came close to this dealership.  Audi's certified program is the best ever.  If you buy one of their Certified cars, everyone will think you purchased a new car warranty and all.  ",5.0

The water came in through the sunroof which they claimed they fixed!! This is not the only time they have said they've repair/fix something and they don't.  Previously I had taken the car in due to a nail in my tire. Took two days to get my vehicle back.  Picked it up not even 10 minutes away from the dealership the tire sensor goes off. My husband got out of the car to inspect the tires. He saw the tire still had the nail in it!!  Went back to the service department and spoke to the Manager only to be talked down to and dismiss us in two minutes. He didn't even us an answer as to why the ticket was closed out without the tire being replaced.  Of course he kept my receipt where it said they had replaced the tire so I wouldn't have any proof of it.  Please take your vehicle to another Audi service department.

After one hour, they confirmed the rain sensor was damaged and it needed replacement. Both Paul and Bryan, the customer attendants, were very courteous and prompt. After another hour the repair was done. When I left the dealership and was driving I noticed the side assist was turned off (I always keep it on) and the voice on the navigation was extreme low, inaudible. I tried calling the dealership 4 times to get some instructions to be able to turn the volume up, as I was unable to do it. After a frustrating 45 min of trying and nobody would help with the problem over the phone, I chose to return to the dealership for these problems. Fortunately, I found Bryan very quickly and he solved the problems.

70,"April 22, 2017","Met James Taylor (my salesman, JT) in parking lot while window-shopping one day.  Answered my questions with absolutely no pressure so I made a point to ask for him when I returned.  He was outstanding, beginning-to-end, even after the sale.  I'm usually a not big fan of the car-buying process (understatement)  but working with JT made this  easy and actually pleasant (even the obligatory communications between the sales manager, salesman & customer).  Nick Villano (the technologist) came to my home and spent over an hour educating me on every aspect of the car's technology and operation with patience and courtesy.  I have seen both JT and Nick when I've returned, both going well beyond expectations to help me.  Also, I must add that Chris Corl, who became my service advisor, has also been extremely nice & helpful. From my extensive online and in-person shopping at various dealerships and brokers for a used or certified vehicle, I feel I got a superior car for a very reasonable price with a very fair trade-in value.  And, btw, dropping by for the complimentary car washes has been a nice perk.  A reader can't possible know that I almost never fill out these reviews but felt the good experience should be acknowledged.",5.0

84,"January 11, 2017","I purchased a certified pre-owned Audi Q5 and from the start it was apparent the service center did not have proper quality assurance and/or verification controls in place before selling/returning a serviced vehicle.   There was a faulty steering column component upon receipt of my new  car, which was checked off as being in good condition on the certified pre-owned paperwork, but it was apparent there was a problem the day I drove it off the lot.  Upon identification the service center was happy to correct the problem; however, when I received the car after repair and began to drive home there was a loud noise that was not there before.  I brought the car back ""again"" and the service center said they forgot to put a cap back on a part, but again they checked off on the paperwork that a test drive was completed, with no issues. 
Next, I had a fender bender and brought my car to the service center for repair, with assurance it would be repaired to it's original condition.  Not only was I not kept abreast of the timeline and status of my vehicle during the repairs, which took more than a month, my phone calls were not returned and I had to constantly follow-up for status.  After I had to follow-up on the significant delay from the original time estimate, it was communicated they ordered the wrong wheels for my vehicle, as they did not verify the current wheels on my vehicle prior to ordering, after I informed the service rep that I put a different set of Q5 wheels on my car.   Finally, after communicating to the Service Director all of the problems I had with his service staff, he assured me he would ensure my car was returned in good working condition.  Upon receipt of my vehicle and inspection by a different Audi service center (whom did an amazing job), it was confirmed the vehicle was not properly aligned, there were two faulty components, and a missing part not installed during the repair, again the paperwork spoke to it being aligned properly and all repairs complete, but the car was clearly pulling hard to the right, which was the side of the car the repairs were performed on.  

I highly recommend this service center implement better quality assurance controls and also keep customer's up-to-date on the status of their vehicle.  

Very poor experience with service quality and customer service.

We negotiated the price and were told numerous times that there was nothing wrong and no issues with the car.

First, the Finance forced us to pay $497 ""Dealer Service Fee"" for a two year Wheels service that we did not need but we were told they wouldn't sell the car unless we buy it. We argued unsuccessfully and took the delivery. While driving back home;we tried to move the A/C slide/tab to get air but it didn't change the air flow direction and the tab/slider dropped as it was not attached to the vent. We stopped the car and checked the rest of the vents; shockingly all three sliders/tabs were just sitting on the vent faking it to human eyes like they were attached. We brought this issue and deception to the dealer's management; the manager asked us to bring car back twice but never fixed it.  Initially the manager Vincent said he will re-attach those sliders/tabs but his service technician told him that they would need to be replaced; the cost to replace was $522 but my numerous requests was completely ignored by the manager.

95,"January 22, 2016","I have resorted to filing a complaints against this dealer to the TEXAS STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL with an online consumer complaint form. Audi Central Houston's management, employees and overall attitude is deplorable. This company deserves NEGATIVE stars.
This was by far the most un-professional, rude and un-knowledgeable repair facility I have ever dealt with. I spent thousands of dollars in unnnecessary repairs at the advice of their so-called service manager. Long story short My Audi S4 was not starting, I was advised to change multiple parts to get it running. After doing so my vehicle was still in-operable, and the ""service manager"" wanted me to spend $2,000 for more parts with NO guarantee of success, but rather to ""move in the right direction"". After declining to do so, I towed my car out, took it to an independent repair facility and my problem was fixed with $227 of parts and 2 hours of reprogramming. And to add insult to injury NONE of the repairs which were done by Audi Central Houston were required to get my car running, FURTHERMORE the additional $2000 I was gonna spend would not have fixed my problem either. These people do not not know what they are doing and they are selling unnecessary repairs which are not needed. I wish I would have saved myself  the sanity, money and time. ",1.0
96,"November 09, 2015","BE CAREFUL OR BETTER AVOID going to Audi Central Houston located on 2120 Southwest Fwy, Houston, TX. This place continuously tries to avoid honoring the warranty offered on the brand new car that I purchased. They do not take care of repairs, which should normally be covered under warranty. In my case, I purchased a RS72014 and shortly after, in February 2015, I noticed an alarm red flag displaying on my board. I took the car to the Audi Central Houston for checkup. Upon checkout, they told me there was a wire problem with my car and that was why the red light appeared on the board. According to them, the few wires that raised the alarm seemed to be destroyed by the “rodents” that may have attacked my car in the past. Therefore, the cost of repairing it would not be covered under warranty, so they asked for $650 either paid upfront or to be claimed under my car insurance. I paid $650 as requested and they told me I was good to go with the electrical wires fixed at that time. I left the dealership and just after driving one mile, the red flag alarm came back on the board again beeping. I returned to the same location right away to show them that message came back again. They took the car for another checkup and informed me that they actually found another four other wires eaten by the rodents. The exact words were: “these other four wires are very expensive and you better claim them under your auto-insurance.” So I filed it under my insurance but because of the delay of the work through the auto insurance policy, I had to pay them $3500 cash in order to get my car back in a timely manner. Therefore, I made second payment to them based on unjustified and faked reason listed as my car was under the rodents’ attack due to cold weather; rodents like to hide in Audis. 
 
In August 2015, the same red alarm sign went on again. I took the car to the shop and they evaluated the issue for the third time under same reason: “the rodents have eaten wires again.” I complained to the Audi USA this time, after which they finally honored the repairing under car warranty. They did not care I was mentioning to them about previous two incidents evaluated under same unbelievable reason: “the rodents”. There was a lack of customer service skills along with false statements in order to get money from customers. Jerald Cardenas, the sales manager, along with Paul, the service person, did a very poor job as far as professionalism (total ignorance; not getting back to customer in a courteous and timely manner) and dishonest services provided. So, besides finding unbelievable excuses/reasons to avoid dealing with getting issues fixed, they completely refuse to honor warranty for a brand new RS7 2014 purchased from their location. Please, be alarmed and avoid doing business with them, as their sole purpose is to take money from the people with no courtesy whatsoever.

After quite a time of searching for the one with the color and packages I want, I found my target here, the largest Audi dealer in Houston, or perhaps as Shad said, ""the largest Audi dealer in America"". I started by calling them, and Kendrick, an eSales agent, answered my call and helped arrange our appointment with Shad, a young and warm-hearted salesman. He never hesitated about fetching the cars we wanted to see, and always patiently explained the details and features of each car to us. Then he would always wait while I discussed with my friends and made a decision. We did not make a deal at first, and after I came back home, we went on negotiating on the phone. A week after the first encounter, Shad called and told me he persuaded the manager into cutting more off the price, and we finally reached an agreement. I guess talking money on the phone is not conventional, which is why their response on the phone was not as quick as in person. But their attitude was still better than the other Audi dealers I contacted at that time.

We are not the stereotypical luxury car shoppers when it comes to appearances but Krista's kindness and friendliness made us feel that we were very important and appreciated.  We had a model in mind as we arrived but she did not try to sell us something that we were not interested in - she simply asked what WE wanted.  We ended up getting another higher end model than the one we previously picked and even when it was a tough choice between the color of identical Audis, she waited patiently in the cold as we were making our grueling decision.  
We were offered a lower amount than we had anticipated for our trade-in from their department who does the appraising and when we said what we were actually looking for in regards to price, she went out on a limb and got us an extra $1,000 on our trade in.  
Krista was VERY knowledgeable and down to earth.  She is very knowledgeable of other car brands through her vast experience working for and real world events that help judge a car.  For example, she gave unbiased information when comparing Audi's competitors to Audi and presented information very clearly and accurately.
I HIGHLY recommend that you insist for Krista Grimes as your sales representative, you will not regret it.  She makes the inherent stressfulness of shopping for new cars virtually non-existent.

Plain and simple, Josh Dorris and his team takes care of my family&quot;s vehicle needs! EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!  Easy to deal with, No BS. I used to own several BMW's a few years ago and I remember buying the first X5 available in 2006. I couldn't even take it home because they had to showcase it the following night. This was my second X5 at the time. I bought several vehicles from them afterwards. My experience with that dealership was far from what I have gotten at Momentum Audi.

It was pretty hot out there so I thought maybe we should go inside and see what would transpire there. After 5 minutes of walking around still, no one approached us. Nevertheless, I know it's a Saturday (which like I said before, can be busy) so we go back outside to look at other cars knowing someone will be out there in a jiffy to help us out, right? Wrong, It's now been 15 minutes and no one has even acknowledged us. I tell my wife, ""OK, we'll give this one last shot"", and we proceed to walk in the front door and stand by the front desk. Surely, someone will see us now. Wrong again. Nothing, not even a ""we'll be with you in a bit"". Seriously? I don't care how busy a place is as it's pretty pathetic that not one person came to inquire about what I was doing there that day. Needless to say we left pretty perturbed. I emailed them saying what I pretty much said here and they replied back to me saying sorry, but even that took a good 5 days. Go figure.",1.0
113,"January 10, 2012","I ordered a brand new 2011 Audi S4 from Momentum Audi.  I live about 30 miles from this dealership and told them up front that I expected top quality customer service when I brought my car in for service.  I was assured by everyone that I would be treated like a king after spending nearly $70,000 for a new car.  Well low and behold first time I took it in for service I had to BEG for a loaner car, this is even after paying them $500 for a ""dealer service charge' that was supposed to offer free loaners, car washes and other perks.  The loaner I got was an older used up A4 that was terrible to drive.  When I brought it in for my second service it wasn't much better.  Did I also mentoion that EVERYONE I worked with when I bought the car no longer worked there and of course I had no one to bitch at but the current management team.  I would NOT recommend this dealership to anyone.  It is in a terrible location, they only have valet parking and they operate in a very small space with their service bays spread out over several buildings.  This is all to bad  because the Audi product itself is outstanding.  I will never buy another Audi again due to the poor service I received from this dealership.  I am now the proud owner of a new 2012 MB ML350 and have no regrets selling the Audi.",1.6
114,"December 27, 2011","I had a great experience with my purchase of a used Audi A5.  Mike was professional, patient and very helpful despite a christmas eve-eve rush.  This was the first time I ever got more than I bargained for as I processed through the financing department and while the financing guy tried to sell, he didn't pressure me the was I have been at other dealerships.

I have read a lot of negative stuff on this site on this dealearship re the service department and I have only had one minor dealing with them, but John in that department was very helpful and friendly.

115,"August 11, 2011","DON'T TRUST THEM. Sales experience was pleasant but the after care has been shocking. It turns out they sold us a car with a patched together exhaust as if it was factory. They failed to register the car at Certified Pre Owned so were charging our extended warranty instead of paying themselves. They make up the same things to repair each time we go in, sometimes the same thing they charges to the warranty 5 months earlier but failed to recognize a known defect with the car so we were driving on a worn out camshaft for the same 5 months. Go anywhere else instead. I found a great place near the Gallaria.",1.8
116,"December 13, 2010","Both times we came in to look at the used Audi it was dirty.  Salesman said he'd have it cleaned for our next visit.  2nd visit, still dirty. After we purchased it (still dirty - 'it was a busy week, sorry') got it home, the paint job was shot - powdered and missing in areas.  We got TOTALLY taken by those crooks.  They also charge $120 MORE for a replacement electronic 'Smart Key' than other Audi dealerships.  ",1.5
117,"August 10, 2010","I will not buy another car from Audi or this dealership. 
OMG they lie and cheat and steal from you and your car when you take it there for service. Wow. Ripped off. The new car I purchased has been in their shop 7 times since February. Engine problems. The first time they stole my wallet from the glove compartment. When one of their employees was arrested for using my Credit Card they still denied any responsibility or that they had a problem. They spam me with emails which motivates me to remember them in an pleasant light.

118,"May 25, 2010","Like some of you, due to the negative comments posted I did not want to set high expectations for this dealership. I was merely in there to look at a vehicle and it's specs. I was a former Audi owner and I was back for another one. Audi sells itself so with that in mind, I wasn't expecting my sales rep to be totally ""Awesome.""

My sales rep, Steven Lutz raised the bar on customer service. There was absolutely no pressure or hassle from him. I asked the questions and he got the answers and if he didn't, he went and got one! I never had to deal with anyone but him. He made the negotiation simple and easy and gave me the best price in town for my A5. The paperwork literally only took 15-20 mins!! Overall my experience so far has been much better than what I would've expected (knocking on wood). I hope this type of customer service is consistent throughout the depts in the dealership.

Maybe I'm the few lucky ones, or, maybe you should look for Mr. Steven Lutz next time before you buy an Audi cause he is totally ""Awesome.""",4.5
119,"October 05, 2009","When you call the service department they never answer.  When you leave a message you might get a call back.  They charge double the amount for service of any type 35k maintenance 380 at other mechanic 150 for breaks an rotors 800 other mechanic 400..... but this isn't the worst part.  Once I had the car serviced I called and got Justin on the phone by asking the receptionist to put me on hold and page someone for service.  I asked Justin about the cost of services etc. Which as the service manager he did not know but gave me a ball park figure.... I then asked him how to turn off the the service reminder light on the car.  He said that it would need to be hooked up to a computer and would cost around 60 dollars.  I asked him what would happen if I didn't turn it off...
Once I got home I looked it up in my manual and wow by pushing two buttons it resets to next 10k service.  JUSTIN IS A LIAR AND THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT IS A JOKE DON'T DO BUSINESS WITH MOMENTUM",1.2
120,"September 15, 2009","If you live in Houston, DON'T GO TO Momentum Audi, the one on Richmond, the service is horrible, they make mistakes, you show them the mistake and they don't want to recognize or do anything about it!

I went to Momentum Audi, for the Oil Consumption Test Part 1, supposedly weighted all the oil from the engine in order to do the difference 650miles later and see how much is consumed. What they did actually, when I checked the level, they've put at least 1qt of oil over the maximum level. I thought it was a mistake, I went back and showed it to the service manager Justin Greenberg, who said I'm mistaken, 1 in over MAX it's normal level for AUDI and all dipsticks are broken. They didn't want to admit the mistake, they didn't want to make it right.

AUDI, this is not acceptable for any car brand, and especially not for a luxury brand! It's not acceptable to sell a car that can use up to 8qt of oil between regular service 10000miles, and say it's normal. ",1.0
121,"June 24, 2009","I read the reviews on this dealer and was very reserved about going to this dealer to buy my Audi but once there this thought never crossed my mind anymore. From the very first moment i met the salesman his knowledge of the vehicle was great, never tried to push a sale and was very easy to deal with. I sold my vehicle and was given a loaner to ride until my new one arrived, took delivery of the new vehicle and the explanation of the new vehicle was excellant. Most of the bad reviews here seem to deal with the service department which i have not (touch wood) had to deal with yet. I previously owned a Range Rover and so far there is no comparison between the service i received, the Audi dealer is 100% better than the previous experience at the Land Rover dealer. Love my new car so far and would definetly return to this dealer.",4.5
122,"May 06, 2009","I was interested in buying an Audi TT a few weeks ago so I decided to check out the dealership on Richmond.  At first the salesman was somewhat friendly, I felt a little out of place, but the service was ok.  There was hesitance from the salesman about helping me.  I am only 20 years old, so I guess he didn't think that I have any money.  This is kind of insulting to begin with.  They didn't have any used TTs in stock so we looked them up on the internet.  I told him what kind, year, engine, color, etc. that I was looking for.  I gave him my information and he said he would call me when they got any TT in so I could at least test drive one.  It has been a month and no call or e-mail.  This salesman is a lousy individual who thinks that only old people have money.  With that in mind, I am definitely not buying a TT from him.      ",1.8

124,"April 29, 2009","Bought a used vehicle not certified from the dealership and look here what i got on a vehicle that had undergone 300 pt check as per the dealership. They even gave me a form filled in by the service guys.

Bought the audi on 30th sept all cash(cheque) deal as they couldn't get me finance and said it has to be cash deal.
12 Oct(200 miles on the car after i bought) i came back with the headliner dropping from all sides and the sales manager told me that the car is yours do what ever you want to and we can't do anything. its not our car now.
30 Oct (1100 miles on the car) i came back with *a drained and dried coolant tank to get a can of coolant that is available on at Audi.
30(1800 miles on the car) Nov the coolant tank drains again and i tell it to dealership to hear back that it happens sometime.
9 January(less than 3K miles on the car) *the car stops and wont start back up and here are the details of the issues
- Changed ECM
- Changed speed sensor
- Change pressure sensor
- Changed secondary water tank
- Changed Fuel Tank
and some misc things, cost - $4370
and not to mention, it took 39 days to repair the vehicle and just that i hadbought *stated warranty at the time of buying the vehicle, saved my ass and i ended up paying only $800 thanks to the machenics not able to show some failure of parts that actually failed to the warranty inspector.


The machenic tells me the brakes need to be changed, tires need to be changed, headliner is anyways gone another expense of $2000.


my take is, if there are so many issues with the car, i dont think these issues cropping up after i bought the car and very much believe the car was patched up to make it look good and sell it to market. It really disappoints me that such a established dealer of such a good brand would do such a thing to sell a vehicle in the market and then would treat their customers like the way i was treated. Ridiculous and worst customer experience i ever had in 30 years of my life. I thought of telling people i drive an Audi, now i feel embarrased to show my car and the repairs that i had to go through. Its just bad bad bad sale.
Feels like being fooled, not sure where i did wrong.",1.6
125,"April 03, 2009","All the reviews that this dealer has received are extremely appropriate. My experience was not with the service side of it, but with sales. I spoke to an agent named Steven and he seemed ok, but was very rude. When his boss Russell took over - it got much worse. He was rude, misinformed and had the attitude that he did not want mine (or anyone's) business! The price for the A4 I looked at was not the best, but not the worst either. The service however, makes the overall experience dissatisfactory!",1.6
126,"January 01, 2009","Car is great but the service is terrible.  This is my first Audi; I've had 5 BMWs and 1MB and never experienced such bad service.  I love the car but the service is so bad that it is not worth it.

Took delivery of a A5 six weeks ago.  I realized after a couple of weeks that the Navigation system was not working.  I called the dealership and was told to bring it in before 5pm and a technician would look at it.  When I got there I was told that they could not look at it without a formal appointment and I had to schedule an appointment and leave the car.  However, loaner cars where not available until the following week.  Brought it in the following week and it took over 30 minutes to get checked in even though I had an appointment and was the only customer there ( I wonder why).  I was told later that day that the antenna needed to be replaced but had to be ordered and that they would send me a letter (I am not worth a phone call) when the part was in.   I has now been 3 weeks of waiting and no letter.  I called the service manager but he did not return my call.  I am now contacting Audi customer service.  I love the car but Momentum Audi service is terrible.   I now regret my purchase.",1.5

I got a good deal on a great car.  That's where the positive notes end!  My A6 has had a few minor issues that have been exaserbated by the fact that the service department always says ""problem not found"".  I am not a picky customer who complains everytime my car makes a gurgle or burp... my AC blows piping hot air every 20 minutes while its on any setting, there is something rolling around in the roof of my car.. but because their diagnostic program says ""no fault found"" there isn't a problem.  As I pointed out to the Service Tech.. they need to be mechanics not IT professionals! Find another dealership.",3.2

I love my Audi (thank God its still under warranty) but the service here stinks!",1.3
129,"January 10, 2006","I also have had a bad experience with the dealership. Yaking my Brand new car in for service. They broke a clearly visible part of my car and accused me of breaking it. Needless, to say. after bitching for 1 hour they repaired my car. Additionally, I requested a rental which is paid for in the sticker price and they as a miricle "" never have a rental car available"".  You can arrive at 6:30 in the morning and you are always too late. For the price of the car, the service is horrible. I woule never reccommend this dealership and have thought about selling my car to not have to deal with them. The quality of service Audi gives you is comparable to buying a bicycle at K-Mart.  Even hyundai and Kia give better quality service. I just might seel the A6 for a Kia.

My Advice: If you must buy Audi --- make your service at another dealership. 

Other than that: I hope you are handy with a wrench!!!

It's always taking ages to diagnosis my car and they are always unavailable. If my car is broken, they'll say the soonest they could get my car in is in 2 weeks time!
