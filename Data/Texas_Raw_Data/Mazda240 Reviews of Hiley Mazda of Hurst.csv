0,"June 22, 2020",I purchased a c x 5 20 17 and January and when I went back thinking that I would buy a 2020 as an update for months later they would only give me less than 6000 for my original used car I find this very disheartening that they would do business this way I will probably never buy another Mazda from this dealership!,2.0
1,"January 18, 2020",The staff here at Hiley Mazda of Hurst is really helpful. Rich Longworth the sales manager who worked with us and helped us finalize our car is a real gem and treats hiss customer both personally and professionally. A real soft spoken person. Service department is courteous. I highly recommend this dealeship.,5.0
2,"May 18, 2019","Emailed every dealer in the area for pricing on a new CX5. Todd at Hiley Hurst beat everyone. We knew exactly what spec and color we wanted and Todd confirmed they had it on the lot. We made an appointment, showed up with our own financing, looked over the car and signed the bill of sale based on the price he had given me over email. No back and forth on the pricing or any games, the price they emailed me was the price I paid. The entire thing couldn't have taken more than an hour, hands down the easiest car buying experience I've ever had.",5.0
3,"April 22, 2019","Best service experience I’ve ever had!  Mark and Gabe made the whole process easy, gave me a fair price, and treated me with outstanding customer service.  I bought my Silverado from this dealership and they have always treated me well.  Will continue to recommend them to friends and family.  Thank you guys!",5.0
4,"January 02, 2019",Criminals worst car buying experience ever. Never again. They lied to me. Insulted. Felt like used car salesman from 1970. Worst car buying experience and I’m 65 yearsol.,1.0
5,"November 14, 2018","Hiley's customer service is radically unstable. Leadership is lax and unethical. Bought a used car from Hiley Mazda Hurst. Before the purchase, I inspected the car and noted the condition of items like new tires and battery. After the car was service I noticed the tires and battery were different and had been replaced with used items. Additionally, I later discovered they did not change the fluids I paid for. This was reported to Mazda USA and I was reimbursed. Following this awful experience, I've found Hiley has loads of social media and Better Business Bureau complaints about similar issues. BEWARE and be on your A-Game if you have to deal with them. Best advice: Go somewhere else- anywhere else.

6,"September 04, 2018","I inquired about a car that was listed online at a GREAT price. Todd informed me the price was a mistake but to stop in to see if we could still work out a deal. I thought the price was too good to be true so I should have known better. Mistakes happen. I wasn’t upset. I still went in, test drove the car and sat down with Todd to talk about numbers. I was up front on what I wanted to pay for the car. He first came with an astronomical number like most sales associates do. But when I began to negotiate Todd became rude and acted as if I was the dumb one for wanting a fair price. He told me I wasn’t serious about purchasing a car and he would get my keys. He not once tried to counter my offer. I spent a total of 10 mins talking to him. Now I do appreciate him not wasting my time but I don’t appreciate him questioning my intent. I would not go to a dealership to waste my own time. Long story short, I purchased the vehicle I wanted from another dealership. And I later found out the vechile I was looking at at Hiley had hail damage. Which they did not inform me of. ",1.0
7,"August 12, 2018","With no appointment, I brought my recently purchased (used) '06 Tribute in for service on a Saturday morning.  Having little service history available, I wanted to have the transmission fluid replaced and have the mechanic check all-around & recommend other-needed services (pro-active preventive maintenance for an older high mileage used vehicle).  My Service Advisor (Gabriel Rodriguez) recommended their 99-point full-circle inspection (great value!), after the inspection was completed, I received both text & email reports on my phone, showing all recommended PM maintenance items with prices!  I was able to select (pick & choose) only the items I wanted performed during the visit, with the updated total cost at the end (makes it so easy!).  Very roomy and comfortable customer waiting area (nice coffee machine), and my Service Advisor provided frequent progress updates.  I selected to have multiple maintenance items performed (Rudy was my Mechanic that day - Excellent Work!).  The Parts Dept was very helpful (along with service) in cutting & programming a new key for my vehicle.  I can't say enough good things about my experience with Hiley Mazda or Hurst/Service Dept!  I now have a verifiable maintenance history for my vehicle, which is always beneficial for warranty & future resale value on any vehicle - from a dealer who will stand behind their work and values their customers!  5-Stars all the way!!!! Excellent!!!!",5.0
8,"May 20, 2018","Coming in from another dealership with a negative experience. Being upfront with the details and being told that he would not treat my experience as that and that he would be transparent. Unfortunately he used my age, gender, and his personal opinion of my credit score as a means to disrespect me. He was later of fact but not on a way that is appreciated, more of a way that he has being rude. Would not recommend.",1.2
9,"May 11, 2018",Clayton and the team at Hiley helped me get the perfect car I was looking for. He made an extra effort to make sure I had all my questions answered and was able to get all the info I needed to make a good decision! Would definitely go back to Hiley if I'm buying or selling!,4.8

11,"February 25, 2018",I dreaded this in advance due to a bad first experience (another dealership). This was completely different and refreshing to be honest. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I'll recommend to friends in the future!,4.4
12,"February 01, 2018","It was my first time buying a car, and Chris Perry was extremely helpful during this process. Since it was my first time he helped me understand everything and made me feel comfortable, and answered all my questions! He really understood what kind of car I wanted and the details that I was looking for. He helped me pick out a beautiful car that I'm in love with. He also helped me get situated in my car and connected my phone to Bluetooth. Had a wonderful experience at Hiley Mazda of Hurst!!!! ",4.8
13,"January 25, 2018",Ruben made my son's first auto purchase a smooth and rewarding experience! Very helpful. Thanks RJ for being a facilitator instead of a salesman!,5.0
14,"January 22, 2018","RJ was amazing.I am not the most savvy about vehicles, and my husband was not able to come with me. I have had some bad experiences with car salesmen at your dealership before, and was NOT looking forward to dealing with this again. RJ was patient, kind, understanding, and VERY knowledgeable.He treated me like I was family.  Most importantly he was very courteous, and was respectful. RJ is such a wonderful employee.  He is truly one of the best people I have ever had the pleasure of dealing with.  He is honestly not what you expect a car salesman to be like.He is quite the opposite, and that makes all the difference to your customers.  He made me feel that I truly had someone on my side trying to not line his pockets, or his companies, but trying to help his customer make the best decision for us.  He never pressured me, and made me feel like I had to make a decision or he was onto the next person.He took his time explaining the car and all the details to me. He did not just explain them he showed me how to do all the settings, and then made sure I could do them.  I did not just get a new car, I got a full lesson, so that I felt comfortable driving it as if I had the car for years. RJ was available for me to ask any and all questions I had anytime I had them.  When I returned a few days later to get the car waxed, and the rattling mirror fixed, he even offered to come get me from the mall so I did not have to sit and wait. RJ is the type of person I aspire to be.  He is your greatest asset as a company.  It is nice to see that there are still people of his incredible integrity, and caliber still out there in the world, and that Hiley Mazda Hurst is smart enough to hire, and employ people like him. I think if other salesman, took lessons from RJ the car sales industry would have a better reputation.  He really should be the model you set for your other sales staff to follow.  I want to Thank you Hiley for employing him, and giving me the pleasure of buying from him.",5.0
15,"January 17, 2018",My journey started a few weeks ago when I began looking for a replacement vehicle for my 2012 Volvo T5 hard-top convertible.  I knew it would not be easy as I had become attached to my Volvo.    I test drove several vehicles and became disenchanted with the whole car-buying experience.  Then I drove a Mazda CX-5 and knew immediately when I sat behind the wheel that I was in love. It has everything I could want in a vehicle.   The new design is stylish and makes the driving experience a whole lot of fun!  I chose Hiley Mazda because of the level of professionalism and service I had with Justin Sample.   I was extremely impressed with Justin's enthusiasm and quick response to my questions.  It was well- worth the 200 mile trip from Oklahoma to make this purchase.  Would I do it all over again?   ABSOLUTELY! ,5.0
16,"January 11, 2018","Thanks Justin for helping my daughter choose the right car for her, after her 2011 SUV was totaled. Not only did Justin help her select the car for her needs, but found all the discounts that applied, plus financing through Mazda. Everything was explained and totally transparent. This was her first car-buying experience alone, and it turned out very well. Also thanks Mike (finance dept.) for explaining everything and answering all questions. Would definitely recommend Justin Sample to help anyone with a new or used Mazda, to find the best deal.",5.0
17,"January 10, 2018","Justin Sample made my car buying experience so easy. This is my third car, second Mazda. I haven't bought a car in about 15 years. Justin attended to every need, question, concern I had. He got me the exact car that I wanted right down to the color! If you are looking for a great salesman and a great dealership this is the place to go! I'm so grateful for Justin and the Hiley dealership family. ",5.0
18,"January 08, 2018","I worked with Clayton, internet sales person.  He was very good at helping me compare the differences and was very honest of what I am buying versus if I had bought from another dealership.  The people over there are very nice, they are not as pushy or judgmental as some sales people are, they allow you some time to think about it. Plus, they work with you. If there is a need or a want that keeps you from having that car, they will work with you to obtain that desire. Clayton was able to take me on the most bumpiest road to prove to me that the car I bought can weather all types of roads. I was amazed. My car was pre-certified, this was important to me, because then I know this used car was already inspected, that there is no faulty with the car parts. They can also extend the warranty of this car as if it is a new car. I was sold. The last step was to get my wife impress, she love to know the features of the car. Clayton was able to attend her needs of the car as well. They had earn our trust and confidence. They work like a team, they want you to come back and buy their cars. ",5.0
19,"January 08, 2018","First time buy a car, couldn’t have asked for a better experience! Worked with Ruben and bought a used CX-5, and then worked with Joe in finance to get a great deal! ",5.0
20,"January 07, 2018","Once I test drove the CX5 I was hooked - no need to look any further. The ride was quite, responsive and one of the smoothest I ever experienced. My time spent on the second day I visited was less than two hours to wrap up all the paperwork. The staff there is very courteous, friendly and very outgoing to say the least. I highly recommend test driving any Mazda vehicle - the safety features alone are worth one of the most crucial points in looking for a vehicle. ",5.0
21,"January 05, 2018","I had been researching vehicles to buy for about 4 months without pulling the trigger.  I then went on the USAA car buying service and submitted requests for the 2 different vehicles I had been interested In.  Justin reached out by email and then by phone. Justin answered my final questions and pricing information on the phone.  I wanted another day to think it over and Justin was not pushy at all.  I called back the following morning to make an appointment to complete the purchase and asked for the out-the-door pricing.  When I came in everything was as I expected with no surprises.  I completed the sale in less than an hour.  To top it off, Justin even delivered the car to my home later that day as I could not take delivery of the vehicle at the dealership! Their customer service is top notch and I recommend anyone on the market for a Mazda to pay them a visit.",5.0
22,"December 29, 2017",I worked directly with Daniel Wright - Internet sales Manager. I got a very competitive price quote via email quickly and it met my budget. With the price already agreed up I visited the dealer for purchase. Process went quickly into finance step with Mike since price is already covered. Daniel assisted in every step. We had a very good experience with the dealership. Thanks you Daniel and Mike.,5.0
23,"December 29, 2017",I had the pleasure of dealing with the internet sale manager Justin Sample. Everything was pretty much negotiated via email and text. No real surprises when I showed up at the dealership to sign. I would recommend this dealership and sales person to friends and family looking to buy a new car. Justin worked real hard on my deal to come up with what would work for me. Thanks Justin.,5.0

25,"December 23, 2017","Looking to buy a Mazda in DFW, look no further than Hiley Mazda of Hurst.
Justin, who I worked with over email negotiating after deciding on going with 2017 Mazda CX-5 was very polite, professional and very helpful throughout the process.
When I decided to go and buy the process was breezy and hassle free, everything worked like clock work at the place and I was in and out in no time.
Thanks Justin and the team at Hiley Mazda of Hurst.",5.0
26,"November 27, 2017","By far the best car buying experience I've ever had. Justin did a great job explaining all of the features of the Mazda 3 and walked me through the whole process. Joe, the finance director, was a pleasure to work with and explained the different payment options thoroughly so that I understood exactly what I was paying for.",5.0
27,"November 22, 2017",I would like to thank Justin and Joe publicly for taking such good care of Me! I love my new car and I'm so excited I chose Hiley Mazda of Hurst! Great service!!!,5.0
28,"November 02, 2017","This dealership is not at all what I expected. Sure, they want to sell cars, it's what they do. But they dont pressure or argue. They listen and do their best to come through for you. Robert is genuinely there to assist you, not run you through a process. I love my new car, and my new dealership!",5.0
29,"October 17, 2017","I had been looking for a used car with a budget in mind and had visited a bunch of used car dealers in and around Irving,Dallas. Most of the sales guys I met during this course (Nissan, Carmax etc.) put me off the moment I started talking tot them. Same old sales tricks, no enthusiasm, just going through the motion. But all this was set to change when I met Jerry at Hiley Mazda Of Hurst. From the moment I met Jerry at the used car's reception area, it was a pleasure talking to him. He was very friendly, heard us patiently and knew all about the car. He helped us with the test drive and made sure we tested the suspension of the car by going to a bumpy road! But most importantly, he had a very pleasant demeanor throughout and never tried to push anything to us, a trait which is so typical of sales guys and is extremely annoying to most. Thank you Jerry, for a lovely buying experience!",4.5
30,"October 16, 2017","Go See JERRY!  We arrived late on a Saturday to test drive a 2017 CX-5 and Jerry greeted us immediately. He was very approachable and didn’t have any of the usual “ick” you get from traditional sales folks.  We explained what we were looking for and before we knew it, we were on a relaxed low key test drive.  He knew all the bells and whistles. As we continued on the test drive he also went over the remarkable safety features. This was our 3rd vehicle to drive that day and the sales associates from the other dealerships had no idea about all features but that was not the situation with Jerry. Hiley did not have the exact color and interior combo we were looking for so we asked them to give us a call when they found one. Jerry called me first thing Monday morning with the CX-5 that had all the features and colors I wanted. We stopped by after work and walked through the sales process. We felt like we received a fair price with low hassle. When I picked up the car Jerry helped me pair my phone, showed me each and every feature on the vehicle and even made my next oil change appointment for me! How awesome is that?! He was just as good after the sale as he was during the sale. Thanks Jerry!",4.8
31,"October 15, 2017","Justin Sample - He is paying attention to your needs and understands them well. Patient enough to give options and honest to admit his limits. Does not give false reassurance and just the perfect person to deal with a lot of questions. You can trust this guy to help you get the best deal. 

Mike Schumann - The final stretch before owning your new car. He is THE MAN from finance dept that can guide you well with the real deal.

Grateful to both of them in helping me own my new car. ",5.0
32,"October 11, 2017","We had been looking for a replacement vehicle for my 17 year old Katya who will be going to college next year.  We had tried a Chevy dealership and were very disappointed in their finance mgrs attitude.  I think it was important to have my daughter in throughout the process
So she would have a leg up on the process in the future when buying a home or car.  The difference was the online preapproval thru the internet sales mgr and later st the dealership the young salesman Justin Sample who made the whole experience fun, light and very enjoyable for my daughter.  No one loves buying a car and feeing the pressures of 
Salesman focused on pricing,fees, and additional pkgs.  at HILEY Mazda it was great the vehicle test drive was light and very humor filled for my daughters benefit and the direction knowledge and care of the dealer was very well received.  We left with a Mazda 3 touring edition my daughter loved it and coming out of a cadillac to a Mazda that's a tall task.  Highly recommend HILEY group!  I don't have the name of the young man that helped prior to justin arriving on the scene but he too walked us around and explained the value in the different vehicle models.  You can tell they love what they do and as a national sales mgr for Wurth USA , I'm all about service well done HILEY we will buy again because of this high level received justin please add a name of the young man that e terrain rd is prior as well and a straight shooter finance mgr as well all very easy to work with.

Best regards,

39,"July 28, 2017","After several months of researching new cars, I decided on a Mazda CX-9, and started making inquiries via the internet. I was swamped with vague emails and phone calls from closer-to-me Dallas area dealers. BUT, Morgan Cook at Hiley Mazda in Hurst gave me quick, straight-forward answers about pricing, and promised to make my drive from Dallas to Hurst worth my time. And Morgan made good on that promise, with numbers I was happy with, and follow-up after the sale. He gave me a lengthy test drive, and was completely up to speed on the vehicle's features. In short order we did the trade and I drove home in my new CX-9, which I love. Good experience all around!      ",5.0
40,"July 24, 2017","Hiley Mazda of Hurst was not on my list of places for a vehicle purchase but it turns out it was the only one I had to visit. I was actually on my way to another dealership when I stopped in and couldn't be happier that I did. Darren Mitchell treated me with the utmost courtesy and respect during the entire process. Absolutely no pressure. I told Darren what kind of vehicle I was looking for and the price range I wanted to be in and he found several to choose from.
When the time comes that I'm in the market for another vehicle I won't hesitate to come back to Darren. I highly recommend him.
Side note: my list of places to visit was 12 and Darren was able to beat EVERY car on my list. One stop and Darren saved me from driving all over the metroplex.

45,"July 10, 2017","I would not go back here if it was the last Mazda dealer in the United States.  They are, in one word, Awful.  The finance department is a complete and total joke, Joe and Mike are not the type of people you want to be giving any personal information to.  They will go out of their way to attempt to cheat and rip you off, and apparently they have zero oversight because filing a complaint is useless.  Joe failed to put all of the sales paperwork in the envelope and it took five days of harassing them to get it.  Neither Mike nor Joe were too inclined to get me the paperwork so I had to contact Alan to get the ball rolling.  Once I had that paperwork in my hand I found out that the maintenance plan Joe sold me for 30% off retail (should have been around $200), was miraculously marked up to $1000 on one of my missing pages I finally got;  In what world is four oil changes worth $1000?!  

I of course filed a complaint and the management at the dealership apparently don't care how their customers are being treated and instead of investigating any issues simply assume the customer is wrong or crazy.  Please, save yourself the headache and trouble, if you really want a Mazda go somewhere else, otherwise just buy a Honda, Toyota or Nissan.  Don't validate these criminals by giving them your business.",1.8

61,"April 23, 2017","Kyle Chase was a professional and a gentleman from the moment he saw us. I made it very clear, right up front, on our first visit that we would not be buying that evening, just looking. He let us take a drive, answered all our questions and told me to call him when we were ready. I'm a picky shopper and don't part with $30 grand easily, so I took my time and Kyle had to earn my purchase.

Any other salesman would've written me off, but he earned my business and my strong recommendation. Hiley will be wise to keep him on hand!

This would be my second car from this dealership.  I was promised assistance with acquiring a second key, Used Car Manager Dave said he would call the previous owners which I know every used dealership uses this tactic and it usually never works. Used Car Manager Dave never calls me back regarding the keys so I have to visit the dealership. I go to the office and a used car salesman assists me to find Dave who is sitting in his office. He goes up to Dave to ask him about the key, Dave gives him some brush off answer which he tries to deliver to me. I walk into the office now because he is sitting there, never called me and could have told me himself. He proceeds to tell me he didn't hear back from the previous owners. Big surprise. He tells me he will try a different way of acquiring key for me. At this point, I'm over it just won't buy from the dealership again. I was also promised a clip replacement for the front of the Mazda 6, that had a dent in it. I call my salesperson Brennan who told me to call him directly to make an appointment to get it replaced in which I did on my day off. He tells me he will get with parts guy and call me back. I end up calling him back for him to tell me they sent the part back and for a ""direct"" answer I could call parts.

The particular vehicle we looked at was a 2016 CX-3 that already had a few hundred miles on it.. 200ish? It also didn't have the new car smell anymore. Turns out, it was the vehicle that was used in all the 2016 auto shows for Mazda. Anyways, that vehicle was priced far above TRUEcar pricing, BUT they did come down on that. The sales managers were professional and nice... The salesman was very nervous. We were EXTREMELY low balled on the price of our trade-in. Our car had 65k miles on it, perfect exterior, VERY well maintained interior. KBB trade-in for FAIR condition on our vehicle was $3800. ........Their initial offer was $500. They eventually came back at $1500.... I felt offended with such a low-ball offer.  We chose to walk away. We went to a different Mazda dealership 2 days later. We got a 2017 CX-3 GT fully loaded with 53 miles on it for less than the 2016 model they showed us. Additionally, we got full KBB value for our trade. This was our second Mazda vehicle to purchase. I plan to upgrade my 2013 CX-5 to a CX-9 early next year. ...I can guarantee you that I won't be coming to Hiley. 

Hiley Mazda did have a nice waiting area.. and there was a kids area with toys. This was a good idea and very customer friendly. Their first impression was good, but at the end of the day, you have to be careful to not offend people with low-ball offers.  ",2.8

I have to say, Brennan and the rest of the staff at Hiley were very professional and willing to accommodate my particular circumstance.  It may not come as a surprise that a sales-person was willing to do what was necessary to make the sale, but I think Heather and Brennan went the extra mile to allow me to drive the car home the day I wanted to buy it.  

  You see, I came to Hiley intending to test drive the vehicle I wanted.  The Subaru lived up to my expectations and I decided to buy it.  It was going to take about a week to move enough money around to buy it.  Mike in finance, along with Heather and Brennan, found a clever way to allow me to drive the car home that day instead of waiting.

When I arrived at the dealership to take delivery of the vehicle and sign the paperwork, there were no surprises.  I walked out paying exactly what we had agreed.

Jeremy drove to another dealership 3 hours away to get us the color combination we wanted the day before we signed the paperwork. Joe in finance submitted our credit app to 3 different banks to get us the best finance rate and then called one of then on top of that to negotiate an even lower rate, and helped us get top dollars for our trade in. We've bought a number of new cars over the years, but this is our first Mazda. We did this deal over the internet and phone and had never met either of them until we signed all the paperwork.

Our sales rep was Darren Mitchel, who took great care to insure that all of our questions and concerns were answered. Darren was courteous and professional, and never pushy or aggressive.

The closest price came from a dealer who based it on financing through them and throwing in other things I didn't really need.

If you you are out of the area ""to bad"" as they will not furnish the oil to you to have it done. Expect you to drive 500 miles for a  oil change which they know will not happen.

134,"May 23, 2015","My daughter purchased a Mazda3 in March of 2014 with the help of Carlton Coote and Rich Longworth.  They were both extremely helpful in helping select the right vehicle for my daughter and there was no hassle or pressure involved.  Rich provided reasonable pricing.  My daughter did not make a decision quickly as she was looking at numerous cars, yet we were treated very well each time we came back.  

Her experience went so well and she likes her car so much, we went back this year and purchased a 2016 Mazda6 (this March for my wife) with the same great people and great car buying experience.  We did visit a Toyota dealer to look at Camry’s a several times and, although the sales people were very knowledgeable and helpful, most times pressure was applied by the “Manager” at the end of our visit with “What can I do to get you to buy today?” 

Needless to say, we went back to Carlton and Rich at Hiley Mazda to make the Mazda6 purchase.  The Finance Departments obligatory presentation of the various coverage options was a bit tedious as we were ready to take off in the new car as bad weather was coming our way. 

My next car will be a 2016 Mazda CX5 for me and I will be heading straight back to Carlton and Rich to make that purchase.   This will be soon as my current car is a 1999 Corolla.   Even though we have had great product experience with both Toyota and Honda, I am ruling out the Rav4 and Honda CRV because of past car buying experiences with Toyota and Honda.  We are going back to where we were so well treated.  Of course, they have excellent cars as well.

We test drove three vehicles and Ryan never seemed in a hurry or impatient. Once we decided on the vehicle we wanted to drive, Ryan completed the required paperwork quickly and then gave us a tour of the dealership. We then moved into the Finance department where we were also treated with respect. Although the process of financing a car can sometimes be laborious, it didn't seem so at Hiley.

140,"March 04, 2015","I'm a Houston resident and was looking for a new 2016 CX-5 in my area. I found a few but none in the color we wanted. Searching around the state I found a single CX-5 in the correct color and it was at Hiley Mazda in Hurst. I emailed the dealership to verify they had it and then intended to have my local dealer trade for it down here. I corresponded with Jeremy Williams who simply asked that I hear him out and give their dealership a chance to win our business. We talked over the current arrangement, pricing, and trade-in value that my local dealer was already going to give us. I let him know that whatever price they came up with was going to have to be enough to entice me to drive 4 hours to Dallas to drop off my trade-in and drive 4 hours home with the new car. Long story short I made the drive and it was worth it. Jeremy and his crew beat my local dealer price by a good margin. I was on a tight schedule having to drive an 8 hour round trip to pick up the car and he had everything all sorted out and ready for me to sign when I arrived. Easy in, easy out, and I was off with our new 2016 CX-5. I would also like to thank Joe Parker from the finance department. His chore was to sell some extended warranties and put together all of the financing documents. He didn't get very far as I turned down the warranties and already had outside financing secured at an APR that couldn't be beat. Where he excelled was in NOT wasting both of our time by trying and trying to get me to buy something I didn't want. He was very straightforward, gave me the info I needed to make a decision, and then respected that decision in a professional manner. A big thanks to Jeremy Williams and Joe Parker for making my car buying experience a great one and not making me regret the 4 hour drive from Houston. Let me know when the new Speed3 comes in and I'll make the drive again!

185,"April 24, 2012","I like most people had already researched the internet and had a good idea of the value of my trade and the price of the 2012 Mazda 3 I was looking to purchase. My first stop was Hiley Mazda in (Arlington) because of its proximity to where I work. All was well until the the sales manager named Seth got involved. He gave me a good value for our trade, but he evidently enjoys playing the new car game ( he plays hardball) with the price of the new car. I gave him a chance to come back with a lower price and he stood his ground. I just walked out. My time is too valuable to play car games.
   The next morning checked my email and had an email from Mike Shumann at Hiley Mazda in (Hurst). The offer was for the same model and equipment of the Mazda 3 and was priced considerably less than his counterpart in Alington and a little lower than my research had suggested was fair. We drove to Hurst met with Mike and told him the our trade  had already been appraised at the Arlington location he agreed to accept that appraisal. Absolutely NO car games at the Hurst location, the experience was pleasant and quick. We love our 2012 Mazda 3, we are Hiley satisfied :)! I don't know how the two dealerships with the same name can be so different .
So, if you enjoy playing new car games Hiley Mazda in Arlington is your place. If not Hiley Mazda in Husrt is where you need to go! To be fair, we bought a Mazda Miata from the Arlington location years ago and it was a pleasant experience. ",5.0

I had a trade in which i still owed money on they did a car fax and found that my car had had damage in the past that i was not aware of so they affored me way less than my pay off,(7000 pay off being 11600)saying they could not even sell the car in their dealer ship and that they would have to send it to an auction (making it seem as if my car was worth nothing.) They also started off with an extremely high interest rate with high payment and 4Grand down.( we origanlly planned on putting only 2Grand down, but they insisted they could not get us in the new car for 2 Grand but they could get us in the more expensive car for 2 Down) (this didnt make sense, how is it they can get you in the more expensive care with less down )  We drove home in the new car but hadnt signed all the paperwork. The next day we decided  that we didnt want the deal ,( didnt seem right) being that the payment was extremely high and they offered 4500  less on my car than i owed.  We took the car back and what do ya know they gave us 1500 more for my car (still 3 grand less than what my pay off was) and got us a lower interest rate by 60 dollars a month(payment) with only 2 grand down. This place with definitly screw you over.this is  how ; I recently went back to sign one last paper and saw my old car there on the lot I was very curious of how much they were selling it for ( i was surprised to see in there because the salesmen said "" We cant even sell your car on this lots bacause of the car fax , we will have to send it straight to auction"" Well that was a huge lie , the car is for sell on their lot for  13690. They were very friendly up untill they sold the car. Then they said nothing to me not high how are you hows the new car etc...

188,"January 31, 2012","I base my positive rating of my experience purchasing a pre-owned vehicle from Hiley Mazda on several levels:

1. The vehicle - Impeccable quality/condition, modest but very nice selection of luxury & performance category vehicles (e.g. Mercedes, BMW, Lexus, Audi, etc.) in addition to wide variety of other choices.

2. Pricing - Out of the gate aggressive pricing vs. competition for vehicle I was purchasing (2008 BMW 535i).

3. Sales Agent - Honest, personable, low-pressure, knowlegable of sales process and vehicles.  Also, not afraid to let me know when he didn't have an answer, but willing to quickly research and find out.

4. Sales Process - Overall, reletively painless.  While we did have some sticking points during the negotion phase, I felt that they team as a whole worked with me the as best they could and they were extremely respectful and non-condensending during the transaction.  Also, during closing, while being offered extended warranties, service plans, etc. the finance rep performed his duties with respective pursuasiveness while at the same time knowing how to take ""no"" as an answer.

5. Post Sale - Entire team was very appreciative of my business, addressed me by name, and overall truly appeared to enjoy what they do for a living.  Also, excellent follow-up communications.",5.0

The opportunity presented itself for me to look at new cars again.  I had decided to again drive the Mazda and I also wanted to drive a Volkswagen.  My husband and I decided to drive over to the Mazda dealership one night after it closed.  We arrived just as the dealership was closing and we parked and walked in the lot to just look at the sticker prices on the cars in the lot without interacting with any employees.  

While all the employees were trying to get out of there as quickly as possible, Aaron Rocamontes walked over to us and asked if we needed any assistance.  We advised we were in the early stages of looking for a new car.  He briefly walked over and showed us a few of the CX7's and gave us his card.   He asked when we would be able to come back and look in more detail.  We told him Saturday morning and scheduled an appointment.  

Saturday morning we made plans to go to the Mazda dealership and then to the Volkswagen dealership.  We arrived at Hiley around 11 a.m.  We drove a couple of different CX7s and then looked a a CX9.  Of course I fell in love with the CX9, however I wanted to drive the Volkswagen before I decided on a car. 

Well....Aaron and Melvin made us such an awesome offer on the CX9 that we COULD not leave to drive the Volkswagen.  It would have been crazy to turn down the car that I loved to go and drive a car I knew nothing about!  

So I am the proud owner of the new CX9 and I felt like both Aaron and Melvin were wonderful people to work with.

It is really to be appreciated. He had the PMA - Positive Mental Attitude by which he could attract me to buy the car from him. I wish Hiley Mazda of Hurst to get more sales people like Mr. Scott who possess the real sales techniques.
I wish him all success in his future endeavours.",5.0
226,"October 19, 2010",WAS A PREVIOUS AUTO PURCHASER THERE. THEY APPEARED SYMPATHETIC TO MY CONCERNS ABOUT ADDITIONAL EXPENSIVE REPAIRS ON MY PREVIOUS CAR.I'D SPENT A LOT OF MONEY ON MAJOR REPAIR 14 MOS. EARLIER.IN LESS THAN 3 HOURS.I WAS DRIVING A NEW VECHILE. I WAS VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THEIR EFFORT.,4.8
227,"September 21, 2010","While I was there Evan kept me up to date with the status of my repair, he also gave me accurate pricing for my repair. You don't get that kind of a service too often. Most of the time you wait and wait until the work is finally finished. He even had fresh coffee made for me.",5.0
228,"September 18, 2010","This is the second Miata I've bought from this dealer.  They've been prompt, courteous and efficient in the two and a half years I've dealt with them.  My payments and A.P.R. were lowered after trading in a two year old Miata and I got more features on the 2010.  The paperwork was handled quickly and the new car was ready when promised and I was on my way to work with no hassles.  Truly a unique experience.",5.0
229,"September 08, 2010","I recently bought a Mazda 3 from this dealership, and I had the greatest customer experience that I have ever had buying a car.  Aaron, in particular, was very helpful in aiding my purchase.  He gave me detailed information on the vehicles that I looked at; he showed me my options and I was able to make a solid decision on which vehicle was right for me.",5.0
230,"September 05, 2010","I spent three days researching the Mazda 3 isport and was prepared to wait a few weeks or to drive up to 500 miles for the right car at the right price.  

After calling six Mazda dealerships in the DFW/North Texas area for quotes, Hiley beat all the other dealers by $750. They didnt have the exact car I wanted on their lot at the time I called but had it delivered within four hours of my request. The next morning I took the car for a test drive, loved it, and finished all the paperwork within 45 minutes without any hassle.  Great experience and highly recommend to anyone looking for a Mazda.  Mike, Melvin, and Julianna are great!

231,"August 29, 2010",I was truly impressed by the experience I had at Hiley Mazda from my salesman Jeff. He gave me a very fair price upfront without me having to get pressure from the manager. The Manager even took the time to thank me for my business and even recommended that I go on Dealerrater which I never heard of until then. I sent my sister the following week and she got the same great price as myself. I work for Lockheed Martin and I posted Jeff's information on the company bulletin board in hopes that my fellow workers will buy from him if they are wanting a Mazda. Absolutely Happy Mazda Owner!!!,5.0
232,"June 03, 2010","Review withdrawn pending the outcome of the service performed on my vehicle.  My initial review was not a good one based on conversations with the service department, but I have decided to take a wait and see attitude before writing a poor performance review.",3.0
233,"May 27, 2010","I just bought a CX-7 from Hiley Mazda in Hurst, the second car I have purchased or leased from them. I love it and I love this dealership. Jeff was our salesman and he was straight-forward, patient, and answered all our questions directly and honestly. Their finance guy (I'm sorry that I cannot remember his name) was professional, friendly and very efficient. Brant and the rest of the service department, are always at the top of their game. The buying experience was excellent (and fun!), and I wholeheartedly recommend the team at Hiley Mazda Hurst.",5.0
234,"March 08, 2010","I own a beautiful Mazda Millenia S and ask anyone who knows about the Miller Cycle engine(supercharger)that it requires first hand technical experience to service it.  I am somewhat of a car enthusiast and therefore have high expectations about the level of service one should expect from a reputable dealer and it's service department. If your shop isn't orderly, clean and/or doesn't have the latest diagnostic equipment...then I have no confidence in the shop's technicians.
I have been taking my car to Hiley Mazda for about 4yrs now and the only service manager I even talk to there is Brant Peterson. Now, that is not a reflection of my experience with some of the other service managers that work there...it's just I have the utmost confidence in Brant as it relates to his excellent technical knowledge and the professional treatment he and his staff provide me even in difficult situations.
Now, Mark is currently the only technician I have given the permission to even open the hood of my car. His extensive knowledge and technical skill always seem to be right on the money whenever my car needs a precise diagnosis.         
These two men are the very reason that Hiley Mazda of Hurst continue to service my Millenia and I believe they represent the very best assists this dealership enjoys!

235,"January 29, 2010","Bought a 2010 Mazda 6 I Sport a few days back. Tom Fred was my sales representative. Tom was very patient with me.  I had not purchased a car in many years.  With the current economy I was very cautious in my search.  While other sales people lost patience with me Tom was always understanding of my concerns.  He answered all my questions, made me feel at home, took care of me much better than I expected.  From Tom, to his manager, to the gentlemen who took my check it was a top notch experience from beginning to end.  Now that I have made a short story long, make it easy on yourself.  Go to Hiley of Hurst and ask for Tom.  The rest will be easy.  Sorry this ended up sounding like an ad.  It just worked out that way.

P.S. Take the test drive---it's well worth it!!!!!!!!!",5.0

237,"January 21, 2010",My car required some serious suspension service.  Service department personnel were very attentive to service issues and scheduled maintenance issues.  Problem was resolved through extended warranty agreement.  These service professionals went the extra mile to contact extended warranty provider and make arrangements for car rentals and repair approvals at a minumum of involvement from car owner. ,5.0
238,"December 04, 2009","I recently bought a used vehicle from Hiley. This was the third dealership i visited, after having pretty horrible experiences elsewhere. Their customer service was the best I've gotten from any dealership.  I was greeted immediately when I arrived and my salesperson was courteous.  Phone calls were returned in a pretty timely fashion, and all of my questions were answered. I didn't feel any excessive pressures into buying something I didn't want or need.  My RX-8 was exactly as promised, in great condition.  I plan on returning to the dealership for all of my service needs. I am completely happy with my experience at Hiley, and highly recommend this dealership to all of my friends! ",4.6
239,"May 08, 2007","First they tried to sell me a hail damaged car with promises of repairing it. When I object they try to offer me a minimal discount . They were advertising on 102.1 that if you buy a Mazda 3 or 6 you get a free GPS system. It was in the promotion period and and not offered to me and after 24 hours I made a call about this promotion. They do not return calls and after numerous promises by Jack, and Phillip Enby I eventually got a rude reply after two weeks after the first call that will not honor the offer.

Why I bought a second Mazda after my Mazda 2005 with 61000 miles on the clock now needs  a new engine , I dont know!

Be careful dealing with this dealership as well as Mazda as a whole. They dont return calls and is definitely not for ""picky people"" My take on this episode is that they have questionable and unethical business practises. Mazda's reliability on their Mazda 6 is also questionable. Read consumer reviews on their Duratec engines in Mazda forums, before you buy one.... It is scary!",2.2
