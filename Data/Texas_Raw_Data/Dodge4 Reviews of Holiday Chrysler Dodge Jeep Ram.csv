0,"June 22, 2020","Easy to work with - no pressure, no sales pitches, did not overwhelm me with information.  Also, you had the best price within a two-hour radius of my home, including DFW.  Jona was very responsive and answered all my questions promptly and completely.  I wanted a firm, out the door cash price before driving from two hours away, and I got that.  Thanks for making this purchase simple and quick.",5.0
1,"April 02, 2020","Absolutely phenomenal to deal with. We had never been there. We negotiated on the phone and drove 2 1/2 hours to get there. They were honest, pleasant and efficient. The sales employee, Husky, was great. So was the Finanxe employee. Buying the Wrangler was actually very enjoyable. I highly recommend. ",5.0
2,"March 24, 2020","I am from Kansas and found the exact truck I wanted at the best deal around through Holiday.  They worked with me with everything I needed, and it didn't feel like I was 500 miles away from them.  I was very impressed with Husky, the sales associate, in how he took care of everything I needed. 

I would highly recommend working with them, regardless of how far away they are from you.

I have great trust in Husky and the Holiday staff.",5.0
3,"February 21, 2020","Easy, worked out payments that worked for us, no haggling or games, did not have to sit at the dealership for 8 hours to get a deal worked out, both salesman ""Husky"" and finance (Eric) guys were courtesy, polite, helpful and we enjoyed working with them.  We've already recommended them to others.",5.0
