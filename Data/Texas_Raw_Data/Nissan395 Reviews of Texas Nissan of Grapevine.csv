1,"June 22, 2020","My experience has been more than abhorrent, for both occurrences (June 4, 2020, and June 10, 2020). I am lost for words. As a personal analysis, the poor customer service received by Texas Nissan of Grapevine Representatives is a reflection from a lack of knowledge, and not enough experience (from the License Tech Inspector to the Service Advisors). When it comes to presenting excellent customer service, it’s not a rush process; the Nissan representatives should not place other customers’ vehicles before a customer (which my vehicle had arrived several days before others), for several days then from a lack of knowledge and lack of attention provides the customer with a diagnosis on the 5th day of having my vehicle, that was suggested by me (the customer), on the first day of drop-off. Later to determine not to be the solution to the problem. Nevertheless, in spite of the incorrect diagnosis by the License Tech Inspector, I was still charged a diagnostic-check fee and an indication of a dishonest complimentary automated exterior car wash (Invoice #444258). The purpose of a customer to have trust in a Nissan Service Department is because the customer feels that the Nissan Dealership should have top knowledge License Tech Inspectors within the areas of the product that it manufactures. My vehicle remained at the Texas Nissan of Grapevine for five days where it did not receive attention until the 5th day. Upon my arrival to pick up the vehicle on the 5th day, I was informed by the Service Advisor (Joe Arriaga), that the mechanical tech inspector, himself, and another employee had all test-driven my vehicle and the problem had been resolved. After I drove the vehicle, I determined that the issue had NOT been fixed. I contacted the Service Advisor via text messaging to notify him of my findings, and that I would be returning the vehicle due to their diagnostic check not resolving the problem. After returning my vehicle to Texas Nissan of Grapevine, I decided that I would remain at the Dealership this time, in order to provide effective communication and transparency with the Mechanic. When I informed the Service Advisor (Nick Keto), of my decision to remain at the dealership and not drop-off the vehicle for the 2nd time, I was informed that the Mechanic Tech Inspector (Jose Garza), said that from his second diagnostics check, he and Service Advisor (Nick Keto), are now reviewing the spark-plugs on my vehicle, but one of the spark plugs appear to be “seized/cross-threaded” within the Cylinder Head. In addition, I was informed by Nick that the Mechanic Tech Inspector will need to remove the Spark Plug in Cylinder 5 (although the Mechanic Tech Inspector had indicated Cylinder Number 3 Spark Plug on the Invoice #444710), in order to proceed with the diagnostics check. Due to the force that may be taken to remove the “seized/cross-threaded” Spark Plug, it could break while removing it from the Cylinder Head which will cost me an additional $1,847.87. I requested that the Mechanic Tech Inspector replace my vehicle back in a drivable condition so that I could leave. I contacted the Mechanic that had conducted a tune-up (spark-plugs, wires, rotor, distributor cap, PCV), two-weeks prior to taking my vehicle to Texas Nissan of Grapevine. The Tune-up mechanic easily removed the Spark Plug from Cylinder 5 and Cylinder 3, without hesitation, nor witnessing any difficulties from a “seized/cross-threaded” Spark Plug that I’d once again been notified of an INCORRECT diagnosis by the Nissan Mechanic Tech Inspector and Service Advisor. There’s a disconnect between what businesses know about delivering exceptional customer service and what they achieve. 

What’s behind the disconnect? Lack of knowledge about how to design and deploy a new customer service strategy with current resources is the primary culprit. 

What’s needed is a way to ensure that customers and employees both have an excellent communication experience that is painless, proactive, personalized, and productive.

2,"May 08, 2020","I bought my Nissan Altima from this dealership in 2011, Its been 9 Years now, I cannot think of going anywhere else apart from this dealership.
The level of maintenance i got from this dealership is unmatchable, I just followed regular maintenance's
recommended to me, NEVER had any major issue with my car. My car still sound like brand New car.
I must give credit to Mark Topham, He is Director Service department, I always found him very co-operative,He knows how to make customers happy. He is a big reason i stuck to this dealership.
Bret Palmer is senior Service advisor, He is awesome too. He always had honest recommendations to make to customers.
Never get disappointed from this dealership.I
I even take my second car (Honda Pilot) to this dealership as i know they are the one of the best Service places in DFW.

3,"April 13, 2020","My wife and daughter went into this dealership in the attempt to get my teenage daughter a new car.  We came in with our own financing.  They were advised that my wife needed to see the numbers through our financing and if she didn’t like them or thought she could do better that she would then, and only then she would let them run her credit ONLY through Nissan.  Well shortly after we found out that they ran her credit through 11 different banks.  I called and talked to her salesman Miguel and the guy couldn’t stop lying.  He came up with every excuse and couldn’t keep his story straight.  He also was trying to tell me that i have to be on the loan in order for my wife to use my employee discount.  (Which is wrong their corp website says differently). I talked to Aaron the finance manager and the dude took up for the sales man doing wrong!  His response to fixing the error was well what do you want me to do?  Let’s do the math 11 inquiry’s X 10 points each inquiry = 110 points off her credit.  This dealership is solely responsible for destroying my wife’s credit.  I contacted the owner Johnny Cantrell and have yet to get a response.  Contacted him via email, phone, and his personal facebook.  Do yourself a favor and do not buy a vehicle from this company.  They lost a sale on a new Nissan Titan and a Nissan Versa.  Grubbs Nissan got my business and they are fantastic ",1.0

6,"August 14, 2019","I went to Texas Nissan on Saturday, August 3, 2019 to look at a car they had advertised online, hoping it would be a good commuter car for my teenage daughter.  I emailed with Isaias Hernandez to set up a time to see the Ford Fiesta.  I made the drive from Duncanville to Grapevine thinking this was going to be a good, easy experience.

We arrived and sat down with Isaias and he wanted to discuss price before we even saw the car.  I told him I was prepared to walk out with a car and pay $7,000 cash.  He pulled the Fiesta around and it was disgusting.  I didn’t even get into the car – it smelled like an ashtray and had cigarette burns on the passenger door and a hole worn in the floorboard by the gas pedal.  I refused to get in the car and should have just left.  But I had made the drive with my daughters and was hoping to be done shopping, so we stayed.

Isaias talked to his manager and then took us to see a 2009 Nissan Altima that had just been traded in 2 days prior.  The car looked like it was in great shape – fully loaded, originally purchased at Texas Nissan, almost all service performed there over the 10 years.  I drove it and noticed a sound I couldn’t put my finger on and mentioned it to Isaias.  He suggested it was the tire tread, so I drove it a little further (I don’t think he expected me to get on the highway, but I did) then returned to the dealership and dropped my daughters off and suggested Isaias drive the car to see if he could figure out what I was hearing.  Again, probably tire tread.

We went inside and started the negotiation process.   I had told him I was ready to spend $7,000, so I was surprised when he returned with a sheet showing the out-the-door price of $9,300!!  I told him I was definitely not paying that.  I had looked up the Kelly Blue Book value of the car and we agreed on a price.  I ended up with $7,700 out-the-door, which was more than I wanted to spend, but I felt like it was a good car and had been well-maintained.  The finance guy offered extended warranty packages on the car, which I declined until he offered to reduce the sales price by $500 and sell me the $700 6-month “bumper-to-bumper” warranty.  I bit on that one, but will be cancelling it this week since the car would basically have to explode for it to pay anything.

I took the car home that afternoon and got in touch with my own mechanic the next week.  He was available on Wednesday to give the car a once-over and found that it needed new tires immediately (they were cracked and in very bad shape), a valve cover gasket, new spark plugs, wheel bearing and an axle boot.  The total cost for all repairs was $1,600!!  I told him to make the repairs and figured I would contact the dealership with the issues and hopefully recoup some of the cost.

I immediately emailed the General Manager (Johnny Cantrell), Used Car Sales Manager (Dave Chappelle), and my sales person (Isaias Hernandez) with the information from my mechanic.  I didn’t get any response back from any of them.  Friday I called the finance department to find out how to cancel the useless warranty and the person that I spoke to seemed to care about my situation and within a few minutes I had a call from Tarek.  He asked why I didn’t bring the car back to them so they could look at it and do the work – my response was why would I trust them to work on it?  They sold me a car with serious problems under the guise of it being a good car!  Also, I told him I had already invested a whole day driving to Grapevine and waiting around – I’m a busy lady and didn’t have another day to spare fighting with them.  I trust my mechanic and he’s worked on all of my vehicles for 15 years.  

I picked the car up on Friday (8/9/19) after the work had been completed and on Monday morning (8/12/19) emailed a copy of the detailed work order to Tarek, as I had said I would.  Today is Wednesday (8/14/19) and I didn’t hear back from him until I emailed him to ask what the status was.  His response was that the car was sold as is and “I will be happy to send you a gift card for like $100 but that’s all what I can do since the car is not here.”  

I’m sure the car will be a good, reliable one for my daughter NOW THAT THE PROBLEMS ARE FIXED, but I will NEVER do business with this dealership again and will post this negative review everywhere I can find a place to post it.  I have purchased two used cars from Sewell MINI in the last 1.5 years and the experience could not have been more pleasant.  Unfortunately, the first car was totaled in a rear-end accident, but the sales person I worked with got me into another car as soon as it became available, and they not only let me take the car to be inspected by my mechanic, they delivered it to him and picked it back up!  Take your business to Sewell, as they will sell you a great car without any funny business!

7,"July 06, 2019",I gave 5 stars because from the time we drove up to the time we drove off in our new car it was so easy and stress free. Miguel and Carlos took care of everything and made the process so fast and hassle free. Car buying at Texas Nissan was he best I have ever experienced. I will be coming back when it’s time to trade in!  ,4.6
8,"June 19, 2019",Walked into the dealer was not greeted. Had to ask about the rogue my wife was looking at. She ended up test driving a Murano and was ready to work a deal but the sales manager did not want to sell us a car today plain and simple. Simple question I asked what does this car cost with my negative trade equity total out the door. Sales person asked his sales manager three trips but he  kept asking about applying for credit. I understand wanting to prequalify someone but why should someone apply for credit for a vehicle when they dont know how much they are going to finance. I told the sales associate we were willing to pay the negative equity up front in cash but my assumption is my word wasn’t good enough. One thing I’ve learned I will always get my deal doesn’t have to be the first dealer. Integrity is high on my list when a dealer doesn’t greet you and sales manager doesn’t introduce himself it’s a bad sign. I’m going to win regardless just takes a reputable dealer with respect for EVERY CUSTOMER. This dealer is trash!,1.0

14,"March 04, 2019","Don’t buy a car here! I bought a used car from this dealership, after I paid for the car in cash I expected to be handed my keys. The sales man told me it wasn’t ready yet and he would have it delivered the next day. A week has gone by and I still do not have my car or money back. The management is terrible. They will dodge your calls and always be in meetings. When you finally do talk to one they don’t know what’s going on. They say they will call you back but never do. The very worst experience with a car dealership I’ve ever had. Lies on top of more lies! Two weeks later and after calling and calling the salesman told me they “lost” the check. Mangers Alex and Trey should not be any where near management. They shouldn’t even be allowed to still work there. ",1.0

16,"February 27, 2019","Very disappointed with my experience with Texas Nissan Of Grapevine. My sales girl was wonderful, the rest of the experience, awful.  I was told on a price for my monthly payment and signed for what I believed was that price, however I was given all the wrong information, showed the wrong papers that I was signing, then used my electronic signature on the papers with the higher price as I was being read the apparent ""wrong"" contract with the price I was thought I was signing. The finance person that was helping me out was obviously checked out of their job because they told me that they had just put in their 2 weeks notice so obviously did not care to much with what was going on. When I went up to the dealership to try to correct the issue I was basically told there is nothing that they can do since technically I did sign the ""correct"" documents even though I was given completely different paperwork as I left there that day. They had no reason or excuse for giving me the wrong documents but just said there is nothing they can do. Not once did a manager come over to talk with me about the problem, I just had to deal with the finance people. I was told that because the finance person ""isn't the boss"" then they don't really have control over anything even if they give out the wrong information. The difference is only $8 but I do believe it is the principal of it all to correct a mistake that they had made. I had family that was going to go there when their lease is up but now they won’t be taking their business there. At the end of my lease I will turn in my keys and take my business elsewhere.",1.0

Texas Nissan of Grapevine admitted it was their fault for burning up our car after an oil change. What they didn’t do was make it right afterwards. The owner of the dealership laughed in our face after asking him to please make this right. The owner said he’s a business man and will not lose money on this and tried to sell us a car at full price with no discount.  He had no remorse or care about the stress of having to purchase another car when we had ours almost paid off. We had to except the insurance money which didn’t even cover a good used car. Then that put us out thousands of dollars during the holiday season. The owner of Texas Nissan in Grapevine doesn’t care about his customers; it’s all about the money. Please share!!",1.0

They insisted we fill out a form which we did and i specifically told them not to run my credit at this time till we conclude about pricing. The sales associate or manager he called himself stated he understood and wouldn't run the credit check untill we were sure we wanted to make the purchase.

33,"June 27, 2018","We leased our Altima in December 2017.  We told the finance manager at the time that we did not want the Premium Warranty since this was a 3 year lease; but we did want the oil change/oil filter/tire rotation plan.  This past May we had our car serviced for the first time - my husband was told after the service was completed (it took over an hour) that we did not have the Oil/tire rotation plan, we had the Premium Warranty.
I called immediately and spoke with Cody in the service department, because I wanted to be reimbursed for the charge because the agreement we signed was obviously changed, he directed me to the finance department and after reviewing our file, they agreed that the lease agreement we had signed was incorrect.  But they told me they would need to get back with me.  After waiting 2 days for a return call, I went to the dealership and asked to speak to someone.  Once more there was a finance gentleman who took my information, made copies of the service bill,( that we had to pay for), and said he would get back with me.  I never heard from anyone.
Yesterday I called and spoke with Elsa Prada, she told me that we could have a principal reduction but nothing else.  I told her NO, that I wanted our money back.  She told me she needed to go to her finance manager and she would get back with me.  After calling Elsa 3 more times, each call went to voice mail and still no reply.

35,"June 22, 2018","I have been going to this dealership, on and off for over 7 years.  I somehow have been influenced by the myth that a dealership service center knows your car better than anyone.  This last appointment has now put me over the edge to never come back.  I waited 4 hours (7a-11a) to have a service center lead tell me what I already knew about a dashboard light.  Never once did he come to update me on any progress and he brushed off my wasted time by trying to defend that “it took them some time to diagnose”.  4 hours???  If that is acceptable wait times for this dealership, coupled with a terse look I was given by the lead when I told him I was not going forward with the repair, and you have finally given me a reason NEVER to return.

38,"April 27, 2018","My buying experience with this dealership was shady from beginning to end.  Ryan, the salesperson who ""helped"" me, did not have the car advertised on CarFax available because it apparently did not pass a safety inspection.

After we found a similar car, a 2013 Nissan Pathfinder, we decided that we would buy it.  That's when things got more and more shady.  After we signed our papers, we were told that the Pathfinder was also not inspected yet and could not be released to us.  That would have been great info to have before we signed the papers.  Furthermore, the day after, they called and said they did find issues and couldn't release it for another day.  After that, we received the car and lo and behold, there were more issues with the car.

Turns out, the repairs would cost over 2 grand to fix.  Everything seemed to work fine when I test drove it, but within a day, issues started cropping up.  I declined the repairs as they were too costly and asked Ryan to cover the diagnostic fee at least.  But, of course not, they already got what they wanted from me.

This dealership has terrible business practices and straight up lies to people to get them to buy their cars.  I was overly disappointed with Nissan of Grapevine would NOT recommend anyone buying from them.  Shame on them.

44,"September 16, 2017"," Made the mistake of purchasing a vehicle for my daughter from this place. Huge mistake. 
I went back and forth with salesman about the price we agreed on through email. While he kept insisting I purchase a warranty for an additional 1800 dollars. I refused several times and he kept lowering the price of the warranty. After I refused for the last time he said I would have to pay sticker price because the price we negotiated had expired because I did not come in the same day. I told him I would take the car without the warranty and pay the 250 dollar discount he said expired. I also said I would give him a bad review. He came back said he would give it to me at the price we had previously agreed. By this time it's well after closing. I'm angry and tired. The finance manager reassured me that he would take care of me and apologized. Finally I thought a decent person in this place. I made the mistake of not thoroughly reading through the contract because by this time it's well after 10 and I was exhausted. I read through my contract when I get it in the mail and lo and behold, the 1800 dollar warranty was added along with the 250 dollars to the price. I was also told I would get an additional key for the vehicle but when I went back they said they didn't have it. 
I should have been thorough when reading my contract but I really thought the finance manager was honest and doing the right thing when he said he would take care of  the problem.

46,"August 09, 2017","I am giving two stars (notice that 2 stars is ""fair"") because the salesmen were very courteous and nice, offering something to drink and even popcorn, but now comes the bad part. I had contacted them to see a used Honda vehicle they were selling in the Used Car Dept. After arriving there and after all of the nice treatment and questions, they said ""We will bring the car for you!"" When the car arrived, it was a basic model Nissan Sentra. First, they said that ""unfortunately"" the car we wanted had been sold earlier in the day in an auction. Then they tried to impress my wife and I by pointing out that the Sentra was much newer and with less mileage (they probably thought that I did not know much about cars). Then I asked another salesperson why we were told that the car was available before we came into the dealership. He said that someone before me already had an interest in the car. Then after much talk about how nice the Sentra was (which is not), we thanked them and headed out of the dealership. The salesman rushed towards us and said that the manager had a good offer for us that we would love. The offer was this: ""there was a miscommunication and the car will be available next morning for us.""

The salesperson Jake McDowell was so rude and condescending, I'm assuming because I'm a woman trying to purchase a vehicle. I left feeling like I would never purchase a Nissan, and would return to Toyota. All of their cars continue to hold their value.

My wife and I have purchased two cars from them and they handle our routine maintenance until a few months ago.  I understand that they do a detailed inspection on your vehicle when you bring it in for an oil change, however we did not expect them to say we needed more work on our vehicle than what was indeed needed to be done.  The rep called us to state that our battery was testing low and needed to be replaced. I asked about the details of what was needed to be done and he stated that they could install a new battery and Nissan guarantees the battery for the first two years for full warranty, then the other 5 years on a prorated warranty.  I asked him since the car was a 2014 model and we had hardly had the car over 3 years with 18k miles on it, shouldn't that battery be under some type of prorated warranty since Nissan batteries have a warranty of 7 years? He said not factory installed batteries, the warranty is only good for 3 years. Knowing that they were overcharging for the battery, I wanted to bring the car to a local Auto Zone to have them replace it because it was $60 cheaper! We had two different places test the battery and it tested just fine! We would have been out $160 if we just said ""ok"" go ahead and replace the battery! We did have them replace the wiper blades for $40, in which at Auto Zone they will replace them for you for $12 for first blade and $5.99 for second! And they are really good blades.  The thing that made me change and have my vehicles worked on by local shops around me was that I needed a tire pressure sensor replaced in my car. I was quoted $198 per sensor to have them replaced. Cowser Tire off i20 replaced them for $60 a tire.  Please, if you are watching cost have other places (non dealerships) to give you a quote or things needing to be fixed or even have them check to see if it needed to be fixed in the first place.

The listing on website said $14,997, but after we got there the price suddenly went up $1k. Good thing I took a snapshot of the original price with my iPhone. Told the sales person we came in in good faith based on the price originally listed. He came back with an entourage of people from his boss to the sales manager and who knows else. Felt like an ambush. They proceeded to tell us the car was no longer abilable at that pricale and if we wanted it ""certified"" would cost $2k on top of thof new $15,497 price. I told them same thing I told the first sales guy, that we came in in good faith because we saw the car for $14,997. We had arranged financing at our credit union, so they proceeded to try to hassle us into financing with them. Was so stressful. What should have taken an hour or two took eventually over 5 hours. Since we have bought the car and left the lot, we've been in and out of repair shops fixing issues they didn't divulge from cracks in windshield to scratches, dents and other issues. They made it sound like because we didn't pay for certification would have to just take it like it is.

As the car I am in is my fathers I said I could LOOK at a few cars. The sales man, Trey was a pushy bully and made me feel like I was in a hostage situation by taking my keys under the ruse of 'taking a look' at my current car and insisting I test drive a few cars. I told the sales people I did not appreciate him and instead worked with someone else to look at a car with some of the features I wanted. After much haggling we got the price down to around 14,000 and the payments down to 349. HOWEVER (and at this point I had been there FIVE hours because it took them nearly two to 'run my credit') we got to finance and began signing papers. The gentleman threw paperwork at us like it was going out of style and in our haste at that point just to go home and have dinner we did not realize they had raised the base price of the car OVER 3,000 dollars (not even counting sales price). I went back to confront them the next day because I had pictute evidence of the base price we had agreed upon (which I signed so he could run my credit) and they told me, in no uncertian terms, that they did not care that we got ripped off, had no idea whose fault it was and would do nothing about it and threatened to 'cash out the contract' because the bank financing it had backed out. We had no other option but to swollow the three grand and finance the car through another bank as they would not void the contract deapite admitting that they had jacked the price up though they 'were not sure why'. I will never, ever step foot in that establishment again and I hope that the crooked people who work there remember every person whom they rip off (because I now know of about two others they did the same to) and the thought of it haunts them enough to keep them up at night and I hope they know they took complete advantage of a struggling single mother solely because they saw an opportunity to do so because when I came in I was desperate and worried and stressed and instead of helping and guilding me to make a better, more informed decision they bullied and bait and switched me at the end. I implore everyone thinking of going to this dealership to stop and rethink their life decisions immediatly ESPECIALLY if you, like me, are struggling and in a not so great place with whatever car buying situation you are in because instead of being sympathetic and understanding they will sink their salesman fangs into you and not let go until, apparently, you have bled out 3,000 or more dollars you don't have and did not want you to spend. Not everyone is educated in car buying and I admit I was one of those people walking in the door. However now I know exactly how shady it can be and all the things you must be vigilant about and do your research. So in final I beseech you once again PLEASE do not consider these people to buy your car. More than likely you, like me, will regrett the decision to walk in their door for the next 7 or more years depending on the terms of your loan. Have a lovely day.",1.0

However, once Harmon, the Director got involved I was satisfied with his customer service and communication.  Even Johnny Cantrell, Managing Partner, assisted in getting issues resolved.  Love my vehicle and if I were buying directly from Harmon or Johnny....would go back absolutely.  

Heres what happened:  Approved for a USAA loan for a certain amount.  Emailed to see if I could get the vehicle at this price?  Emailed back by Nate yes...awesome and go to dealership on a lunch break to test drive.  Passed on to Joseph Green.  Take car for drive...love it.  Let's do the deal.  Comeback, price given was $700 more than quoted by Nate, and almost two hours later I leave after waiting for them and while waiting another salesperson comes and grabs keys to show the vehicle I'm negotiating purchasing!  

Walk out, and when I get to my car, Nate comes out and asks ""I'm not upset that their showing the car"" to which I reply ""yes, just bad customer service"" and he then remarks well you weren't going to get the car at the monthly price you wanted anyway!   Mind you I had waited patiently over an hour cause I wanted the car!

Harmon calls me back, apologizes for the salesman behavior and I work out a deal with him on the price I want.  I go to pick-up vehicle told it would be gassed up and nope...gas tank has less than a quarter and the inspection sticker expires the same month I bought the vehicle.  

Email, Joseph and copy Johnny on it the day I buy the vehicle...It takes 6 days for Joseph to respond only after Johnny emailed me to see if anyone had responded.  Joseph responds to tell me they'll fill up the gas, but the car is ""as is"" and they can't do anything about the inspection sticker!

Luckily Johnny intervened again, and said bring vehicle back...we'll do inspection and gas up the vehicle.  If not for the great customer service of Harmon and Johnny I would not have done the deal, and worse if they hadn't intervened I would have had to pay for inspection sticker that expired at end of February though I bought the car on 2/13/15!-)

With a savings of $4K+ off MSRP and a 0% loan, I KNOW I got exactly that.  I'll definitely recommend Texas Nissan Grapevine to anyone in the market for a new Nissan!",5.0

115,"August 15, 2013","I bought a new car from Texas Nissan of Grapevine.  I hate the whole car buying experience and I told Travis that over the phone.  I was very direct and told him I didn't want any games and not to waste my time, I knew what the numbers should be and I wanted him to be straight with me.  I told him I would be there at a certain time and he said he would have all the numbers pulled by the time I got there.  Travis is one of the sales managers I believe.  When I got there he also brought in Tito who is a car salesman with expertise on the 370Z.  They answered all my questions, said they could find the car I wanted with everything I wanted on it and it would be a 2014.  There was minimal back and forth with the numbers and the trade-in.  I was happy with the deal and happy in dealing with Travis and Tito.  

I went to speak with Russell about financing and the manufacturer's protection plan (MPP).  I told him I had already been to the credit union where they were showing Texas Nissan of Grapevine to be one of their feel dealers.  I could get an interest rate of 2.3%.  We spoke, discussed the MPP and got all the paperwork together.  I spoke to them a few times during the week and I picked the car up on Saturday morning and it was everything I had asked for.  During one of the conversations that week, Russell told me he got the interest rate down to 2.03%.  He got most of the paperwork done so all I had to do was sign when I came to pick up the car.

When I picked up the car Josh went over all the bells and whistles with me and provided a thorough explanation of what all my new car could do with regard to navigation, blue tooth and lots of different settings that can be tailored to your personal preference.  He also set up te appt for my window tint and when I showed up on Tuesday morning for that the service dept. was very on the ball.  They were expecting me and said I would be in and out within an hour and I was.

Later that day Tito and Josh both called to find out how the tinting went and if I was still happy with the car and whatever I needed just to let them know.

Charlie Swanson is the general manager at the dealership.  I had some dealings with him when I had another vehicle and he was the GM over there.  He is very competent and personable and seems to handle things in a way that is very unique and successful. I was really glad to see him at this dealership.

I met the owner Jerry Cantrell briefly and he seemed very nice.  I don't know what the man is doing with that dealership but it is running like a well oiled machine in every department.  He would probably be a great mentor to someone who wants to run a successful, friendly, amd competent car dealership.

One of the things I loved about this dealerhip from a female perspective, was that they never treated me like an idiot or that I was an easy mark and tried to take advantage.  They never asked me if I was married, if I could afford the car or if I had to make the decision with someone else.  It was really refreshing.

So, I would recommend this dealerhip.  My experience was all positive and I feel like they will try and continue to make it that way.

Thank you.

For the second car i purchased a Nissan Altima Coupe 2010(red). When I came onto the lot they asked if I were looking for a car i told them no, because the motor went out and I was still paying on it. I wanted to get the car fixed before i were to trade it in, I felt that would be the right way to handle my situation. Cyrus said no worries we'll take care of you here at nissan especially since your  a previous customer (my mom, dad, and girlfriend all have new cars from here). He's tellin me yea for sure we can do this, the trade in won't be a factor, all 4 managers came to me and approved the deal. we filled out the paper work for the altima and my previous car so they can pay it off. I left that night in a beautiful car and i had even already got my insurance swithed over. Here's the bad, during the next 3 weeks with having the car i had to travel several times(5) to this dealership which is an hr away to bring them different types of paperwork to finalize everything each time i came back i would ask is there anything else yall need from me so i dont have to drive so much they say each time NO your taken care of. I tell the manager they sold me the car with less than a quarter of gas and now since i had been going back and fourth I wanted some gas for it. he said i cant do it right now i can only give you 3 gallons and you have to come by appointment. that BS. then on the 3rd week they call me again asking me to come out and put the finishing touches on everthing and wasnt this suppost to be done 2 1/2 weeks ago! When I get there they are telling me how the salesman was dumb and did not know what he was doing however all managers in sales and finance looked at the deal and approved it. My salesman was not even there to back me up on it because he got fired for slapping one of the managers for something etc. long story short, they told me i could not no longer drive the car i origionally purchased and would down grade me to a vehicle of they're choice. Smh they had already also told me my vehicle was paid off 3 weeks prior as well and now that this has happened i am 2 payments behind on the old cars car note and it is effecting my credit negatively right now.

126,"May 06, 2013","The buying process was a great experience.  We were able to get exactly what we needed and for the price we were wanting.  However, as soon as we left the front door, the experience started to go south.  During the sale we talked about the fact that the side view mirror was broken.   While we were filling out the paperwork we were told that we did not need to put the mirror on the ""We Owe"" sheet because it was a ""safety issue"" that they will take care of.  
Here we are almost 2 months later and 10+ promises later, from more than three people at the dealership (managers included), and we still have no mirror.  Nissan of America was contacted and a complaint was filed.  When the manager called us back about the complaint, he called us back about the WRONG customer and vehicle!  While we were still waiting on the mirror, I received a voicemail from the original salesman trying to sell me a vehicle!

127,"May 04, 2013","We came into Texas Nissan to lease a 2013 Nissan Pathfinder. We told the sales guy that we were looking to lease the car and not purchase it. We sent 4 hours at the dealership the first day to negotiate the cap cost of the car. The sales associate and finance manager were trying to get me to buy a ""lease payment"". From reviewing the lease buying guide at Lease-Guide.com I fully understood the figures that went into the final lease payment.

The sales associate went back to the finance manager and they brought out the paper which had three lease payments based on the amount I wanted to put down. They also had another column that had the break down on the ""price"" of the car. In the ""price"" of the car they included a $1000 rebate (which I learned at the very end could not be applied to the cap cost of the car for a lease, only a retail purchase). They kept harping on this final number as I was trying to figure out if there numbers they were providing matched the Lease-Guide.com leasing formula. I could never match up their monthly lease payment with the figures they provided me. We walked out that day.

The sales and finance manager called me several times and we finally negotiated a deal over the phone. The original lease offer on a 2013 Nissan Pathfinder SV (with towing package) was $3000 down / $380 per month / 12K miles. We negotiated down to $2000 down / $370 per month. I still could not get the Lease-Guide.com formula to work out to the $370. Had they been upfront in the cap cost of the car this payment should of gone done by $15 per month. 

We went into sign the paperwork (mind you we had already spent 4 hours on another day) and to pick up the car. It took another 4 hours for the paperwork to get completed (we had scheduled an appointment to come in)! We were signing the paperwork and noticed that the cap cost of the car was $1000 higher than what the finance manager was telling me. So I finally figured out why I could not get the lease calculator to match up with the $370 per month payment. We now spent a total of 8 hours to finalize the deal. 

To top it off they dealership called me about 10 days later that they used the wrong VIN number in the paperwork. So we had to schedule a time for them to deliver the paperwork to the house for us to sign.",2.3

129,"March 22, 2013","My wife and I purchased a pre-owned 2011 Nissan Pathfinder. I have been looking for mid-size SUVs for months, as I knew that it was getting time to replace my 2002 Infiniti Qx4 that had nearly 173,000 miiles. I was amazed that I found pretty much exactly what I wanted at Texas Nissan of Grapevine which is only 15 minutes from where I live. I started emailing back and forth with a pre-owned salesperson Larry Brown to ask a few questions to make sure that the Pathfinder was in fact what I was looking for. I went to the dealership the same day with my wife because if I liked the Pathfinder, I was going to purchase. The vehicle was VERY clean and in great condition, so we were impressed. When looking at the Pathfinder, the ONLY thing that we hesitated on was that it did not have a cargo cover to conceal items behind the seats. This was very important to us as we do not want to expose items that we have in the back. This was so important to us that we told Larry and his boss that this would be a deal breaker if we could not get this item in the deal. Larry searched online and ran back to their parts department and found out that they could order a cargo cover and were nice enough to include it in the deal. The even gave us a ""we owe you"" document stating that this was part of the deal. So we negotiated and agreed to purchase. I must say that the negotiation process was pleasant and we believe that they listened to what we needed price wise and with our trade in. The problems did not start until we went to the finance department. I have bought many cars in my time and this was the WORST finance experience that I have ever had! We waited an hour in the lobby waiting for a finance manager. We started to leave and our sales rep assured us that it would only be a few minutes more. We even pointed out the dealership promise to Larry. The number ONE promise is that they wilI respect the customer's time. I was impressed with Larry Brown as he went to get us dinner because we had been at the dealership for nearly three hours at this point. (This was very much appreciated and not expected.) Almost thirty minutes later we were in the finance process. Chris Cole, our finance manager at first did not have our information correct. We started telling him about our wait and that we almost left. He was very apologetic and actually helped us save quite a bit of money, not only in financing but in extended warranty programs as well. We keep our cars for quite a while so I usually look at extended warranties. Even though we were upset with the dealership wasting our time, we felt that we got a good deal with the vehicle. This is only the begining. It has been a month now and we DO NOT have the cargo cover that we were promised in the deal and after the sale follow up and service has been horrible! We have called for Larry Brown numerous times to follow up on the cargo cover and he keeps telling us that it is coming. I finally called their parts dept and at first they knew nothing about Nissan cargo covers, but did finally see that Larry Brown had ordered one with us. I was told that they would hunt it down and call me back. No call as of yet. We just called the dealership asking for someone in management to call us back today or we will be calling the Better Business Bureau on Monday of next week to report this. I still like the vehicle that I bought, but I now realize that I should not have purchased it from Texas Nissan of Grapevine. And I do not recommend this dealership to anyone. They were sure in a hurry to sell us a vehicle, however they have not been in a hurry to help us after the sale.",2.6
130,"February 20, 2013","Initial client service here is excellent. Of course, they will accommodate any need that you need met prior to the sale. Once the sale is made, they come across very shady, short, and uncaring. 

I bought my car at night and missed the dangling fog light and hidden broken bumper. After bringing the car back within the first couple of days for maintenance, Nissan refused to fix it. After speaking with a manager, they proved the car was in perfect condition the morning I bought it via photos but one of the maintenance people drove the car over a curb and broke the bumper and fog light. After bringing this to their attention and having it for word of mouth by a manager they STILL REFUSED to fixed it. Even knowing this car was busted, they still sold it. Rather unethical.

The employees called us liars and were extremely rude even after their own manager said it was their fault. They provide the worst customer service experience period AFTER you have bought the car. DO NOT go there if you plan on having future maintenance. They just seem to be all about getting the money and forgetting the customer.",1.6

I came in from Houston on business but I had looked a week before in Houston and couldn't find the White Platinum Premium package with all the bells and whistles that I wanted so I decided to look in Dallas.  Luckily my brother who lives in Southlake drove me to Texas Nissan of Grapevine and my Pathfinder was waiting for me!  The new car sales manager Gabriel Falcon was also great to work with and he was able to give me a great deal.  Financing was quick with Chris.  Lastly working with Josh the new car coordinator was fantastic.  He explained everything I needed to know about all the technolgy on the Pathfinder, and he setup some settings that fit my needs.  Josh has also followed up to ensure my Nissan experience was still going strong; which it is.  I'm super excited with my purchase and my experience with everyone that I met at the dealership.  Even the owner was around to ensure everyone was giving their best to all the customers, which was nice to see.  I highly recommend this dealership for its professionalism, attitude and great smiles.

132,"January 17, 2013","I've bought many cars over time and our purchase of a 2013 Pathfinder from Texas Nissan was the best, most pleasant transaction ever.  It started with Johnny Cantrell, an owner of the dealership, who was very responsive to my requests for quotes even via email. He even used his cell phone to reply to some of my questions with very rapid response.  He listened to me explain my needs and was efficient in his responses. He quickly found and obtained the Pathfinder with the specific options we wanted - didn't just try to push one of his current inventory on us.  When I told him I was going to compete his offer, he gave me some excellent advice as how to compare the offers.  I didn't tell him, but I planned to give him last bid - didn't need to go there.  When we had a small hiccup in Financing he jumped right on it and offerred a compromise that fit of our needs and turned around a possible customer sat hit on Finance.

Terry McCain was the salesman and he treated my wife and I with utmost courtesy and attention.  My wife was thinking about a Chevy Traverse (I wanted the Pathfinder!) and Terry was instrumental in helping me sell the Pathfinder.  He knew all the features of the car and demonstrated them in a competent and efficient manner. When I called him the day after the sale and mentioned we had a very small hiccup in Finance, he jumped right on it and the Finance director called me right back.  We dicussed the minor hiccup and got with Johnny Cantrell and came up with something that smoothed out the issue.

Brad Gibson was the Finance person we dealt with and although new to Texas Nissan, he demonstrated great courtesy too and was efficient in preparing the paperwork, He handled our questions with straightforward answers. The 2 MINOR hiccups - the mileage readings from the new car and our trade in were off - Brad called Terry to verify the mileage on both vehicles and the matter was disposed of quickly. The other hiccup was the issue of what additional mileage charges would be for the lease. This issue was clarified the next day with apologies from the Finance Director, Shawn Hodges.  

Josh delivered the vehicle to us almost at dealership closing time in the cold weather. Even at the late hour he took the requisite time to explain all the features in the car.  He also gave us his direct number to call if we had any further questions.  Again, very courteous.

So, the people I dealt with at Texas Nissan were top quality, customer service oriented folks. I did not at any time feel the pressure that normally comes with buying a new car.  No salesman running back and forth to some sales manager and playing with buyers' sentiments.  Just efficient, factual discussions.

138,"June 29, 2012","My wife and I visited the dealership to view a 2012 Nissan Maxima a couple of weeks ago.  We explained to Lance Fleming and Clinton Calhoun III that we were trying to decide what car to purchase (Nissan or another make).  They were both very courteous and polite and understood our purpose and did not high pressure us.

After we decided that the Maxima was the car for us, we told them that our nefhew was going to do the pricing and dealing with Johnny Cantrell, the General Manager.  My wife drove the car and was pleased with it so we worked with them on the specifications.  Again, no high pressure.

End of story, we purchases the car on June 25, 2012 in the late afternoon.  The car was made ready and the paperwork was completed.  After a review of the operating instructions for the car, we were on our way.

A very good experience.  In fact, it was the smoothest car purchase that I have ever made.  My initial reason on going to the dealership was that I already own a Nissan Rogue (from Texas Nissan) and have received outstanding service on that vehicle.  I live about four miles from the dealership in Colleyville.  A good deal is one that works for everyone involved and this one fits that.",5.0
139,"June 13, 2012","Certified Pre-owned  to Texas Nissan of Grapevine means dents hidden behind the rear bumper  which was bent bad weather seals on drivers door ,window motor skipping . When they did try and repair the rear lower quarter panel of the driver side behind the rear bumper. The new paint was very poor and had not been rubbed out with compound and sealed. All the hand work to restore the shine was done by me. The old bumper was still on , the weather seal was still ripped. They had the truck for over  7 working days.   We have not even made our first payment to the bank yet and told them about the problems the very next day after purchasing the truck with in 10 hours we reported it to TNG. You see we purchased the truck at night and could not see the damage hidden behind the bumper corner . I did not have a flash light in my pocket and when I ask they said the shop is closed,  we can't find one all the excesses. The three sales people shoving this truck down my throat Sarah, Nathan and Jason all at 11pm said we don't sell junk it is a CPO car even the brochure says like new read it. Well with in 10 hours I was sad to find out the truth so we called TNG . They said bring it to us we will see. We took about 10 days to get back up there as it is an hour drive. After they tried to give us the truck back over 7 days later  still with problems .  We tried to talk to the service manager  he said he could not help us and said you need to see Utah used car manager . Then for lack of a better term a human came out named Johnny who said lets see the problem and talk. So we go to the truck and from that point on that was the most condescending, twisting words, lying piece of flesh that has walk the earth in years. I tried to tell this person what had happen and he said stuff like you can't look at the car, cpo is not like new, You did it , He then offers a two hundred dollar check , a new plastic cover for the hitch area on the bumper and the weather seal for the door all of which they don't have now but will send to me in the mail . Which i have to install the two parts and i still have to get a bumper. The Two hundred won't cover that bumper . I just would not trust them to touch a child's bike at this point and if a check does show up. I'm not sure we will cash the check.  I think i will talk to a Lawyer buddy and the columnist the watch dog form the star telegram he loves stuff like this first.  Hay Texas Nissan grapevine it is my mission to spread the word about your 3rd world treatment of women and the type of poor sales tactics used by your employees and the poor attitude of management i want to cost you car sales by spreading the truth and i see a lot of people in that area every day .

140,"June 11, 2012","I went in to this dealership to purchase a used car they had listed online, price in my range at 9,000. I worked with Misty one pricing and a test drive, then she later came back with her manager Sarah and told me that because the miles were too high (62,000) they would not be able to finance me, but that I had been approved for a 22,000 dollar car that I could in no uncertain terms afford. They failed to quote me the price until AFTER I had taken the test drive, worked a finance program, been ""approved"" offered trade-ins etc etc.

The 'Ol Bait-n-Switch

After I said ""I can't afford this thank you for your time have a nice day"". I began walking out at which point THREE PEOPLE followed me to my car harassing me the entire time. I had no idea THREE PEOPLE were even watching Misty try to sell me a car. One of the people following me even walked in front of me blocking my access to my car.

141,"May 25, 2012","I have never wanted to RUN out of a dealership so fast.  First of all, I was looking for a used Murano in the $25k range.  This was within my budget.  They knew I was coming, so they had a Pathfinder ready and waiting for me to drive (go figure).  They wouldn't discuss the price, they wanted to back into the payment versus just tell me how much the car was and let me make a decision on what I could afford.  The car was over $35k and they tried VERY HARD to make me settle on a payment that was $150 more per month than I could afford and a 72 month term.  
When I said NO, they literally followed me out to my car... two sales guys and a finance person.  I turned around and said, ""even if I liked the car and could afford it, I would not buy it from you because I feel so pressured"".  The finance guy said we are not trying to pressure you.... could have fooled me!  
Two days later, my sales guy, Ken, calls to say ""we have a 2011 Murano that you can afford. Want to come see it?"".  I asked how much it was and he had the audacity to say, ""Well I don't know yet, we just got it in"".  Are you kidding me?  
Needless to say, I will NEVER step foot in that dealership again.  Their tactics are LAME and it's sad that Grapevine has a dealership like this within its City limits.

I found Nissa of Teas online while looking through some of their inventory so I decided to come in to check it out.  I worked with Travis Evans in sales right from the start.  Working with Travis Evans was the best experience I have ever had at a car dealership.  He was courteous, well spoken, knowledgable, not pushy, on time, and followed through on all my requests.  We found the car that I was looking for and got it at a fair price for both sides.  They also paid off the rest of my loan on my old car which needed some things fixed on the car.

Josh sat down and asked a lot of questions about my income and trade in etc.  Then he went to go pull some keys for some vehicles that would fit in my price range of $200-250 a month.  I asked him about the 2008 Nissan I had originally seen online.  He told me it was no longer at the dealership.  I finally saw a 2010 black Nissan Altima and it was beautiful!  We took a test drive and I loved it so then the negotiating had to start.  I told Josh that my trade in was broken and I was tired of fixing it, I did not have money to put down towards a new one and I needed my payments to be fair so I could actually afford it.  Travis made a deal where I could get the vehicle for $349.00 a month but it would be a 72 month loan.  I was okay with that even though it is still steep but I needed a vehicle.  Even though I am paying more than I wanted to for my car and I had to sit at the dealership for over 4 hours Josh and Travis and Garrett (the finance guy) were very helpful.

Mr. Cantrel, the owner, also came and introduced himself to me, which I thought added an extra special touch to closing the deal. I already plan to do business with Texas Nissan of Grapevine again and again.

Of course, there were a few others that phoned from time to time and because they are saavy enough to not be too pushy, I am the proud owner of a 2011 vehicle.

From the moment we walked through the door, we were treated fabulously. I originally went in to price, not buy, a base model new Nissan Versa sedan. I walked out of the dealership with the keys to a 2011 Nissan Versa hatchback with just under 16,000 miles. My husband and I had been sharing a 2 door car, but with a baby on the way, a 4 door car was a necessity. Being a homemaker and stay at home mother when the baby is born, it was imperative that we have 2 vehicles. I expressed my concerns with James and he did everything within his power and more to make it possible for me to have that 2nd car. I went in for a base model car, because they are cheap. I left with a certified pre-owned wonder with an automatic transmission, power locks, power windows, power mirrors, cruise control, and so much more for a price we could afford. James and the rest of the team stayed and worked with us until we left with our new car at 11:15 pm. Keep in mind, I was only going to browse. I set up a 7:30 pm appointment with no intention of purchasing a vehicle. I test drove 2 different used cars and went with the one that was better suited for my needs.

164,"November 18, 2011","I was in the market to trade my car for a new one. It's general knowledge, I believe, that this can put a person on thin ice. After doing some homework and visiting several dealerships my belief was confirmed. Every dealer wanted top dollar for their new car and suggested that my trade-in had the plague.

When Dwight Walker of Texas Nissan of Grapevine called, I told him what kind of car I was looking for, what price I was willing to pay, and what I wanted for my trade-in. He said his dealership could do that. All I needed to do was bring in my trade-in and give him a chance.

Could anyone possibly know how many times I had heard that? It's just a ploy to get an unsuspecting victim into enemy territory. I told him that I was tired of the game and was resigned to driving my car until it died a natural death.

Unlike others I had spoken with, his pleasant matter-of-fact attitude convinced me that if my trade-in was as I had told him, it was a done deal.

I went, but didn't expect things to work out any differently. Well......I was wrong!
He did everything he said he would do. In less than 2 hours, I drove away in my new Nissan.

If you're in the market for a new car and don't want to play ""the trade game"", visit Texas Nissan of Grapevine.

176,"October 19, 2011","Had very good service at the time of the sale.  We actually drove almost 4 hours to look a two similar specific cars that we saw on the internet.  I even called and made an appointment. We were very upset when we found out about the certification cost of $2799 was on top of the internet price that was advertised.  I thought I was looking at vehicle that was priced at $18,900 but when we got into negotiations I was informed that the vehicle price was $18,900 plus the certification fee of $2799 which was very disappointing.  I really wanted to walk out and come home. However, I needed a vehicle and this certain vehicle was difficult to find in Oklahoma so I decided to negotiate the price.

At the time of the sale, I asked about two remotes but only received one remote and was told they only had one remote for the car.  I should have received two at the time of the sale regardless of what was brought in when the vehicle came in. Nissan should have purchased the second one for me.  There was no navigation disc in the navigation and I was very adament about having a disc before I left the dealership and still didn't get one by the time I left the dealership.  There was no manual.  

I was assured I would get a manual and a navigation disc.  It took about a month before receiving the disc.  I received a manual from the service manager at Jackie Cooper Nissan in Tulsa when I took my vehicle in for service.  I called several times and no one would return my calls.  The service manager at Jackie Cooper Nissan in Tulsa even called for me.  I was so frustrated at this point.  I put a $3700 down payment and made my first payment in the same month and no manual, nav disc and no title.  After finally getting a hold and having a very frank conversation with Mr. Wiley, I finally got the nav disc the next day.  Mr. Wiley called me and continued to ask me to rate the dealership so they would get paid and I refused until I got my title to my vehicle.  I finally got my title to my vehicle only to discover my husband's last name is spelled incorrectly on the title which is the same name as mine. 

Mr. Wiley was helpful and the only one at the dealership that was helpful.  Sean Briggs was helpful at the time of the sale in the business office but I was very dissappointed in the service after the sale. 

I found out later that Jackie Cooper Nissan only charges $1700 for the certification and it is included in the price of the vehicle that is advertised.  Needless, I will not buy a car from this dealership again.  ",4.4

He said that the payment method had to be set up through automatic bank withdrawal, but it would save me money and shorten my finance term.  I later found out that I should have been eligible for a really good finance rate (my credit score was well over 700), and that I didn't have to purchase a warranty or be set up on a bi-monthly payment plan.

187,"October 07, 2011","We were looking for a used Nissan Altima Coupe and did a search on-line and found that they had some available at Texas Nissan of Grapevine.  We went over and dealt with Nathan who helped us with purchasing our car.  We did a 15 or 20 minute test drive, and the car drove great.  It was my first experience purchasing a used car and overall it was good.  This is my third Nissan car and my mother has had three herself and I know the cars a made well, which is why I comfortable purchasing used.  I just wish I had taken a little more time inspecting the car, because minutes after driving the car off the lot I realized the break pedal was missing the rubber cover.  (grrrr)
We purchased the car on Saturday, they were closed Sunday, so on Monday when I told them the break pedal was missing, they were like ""Oh Well"".... Their excuse...we ""lost"" so much money on this deal - really???  They didnt come down one penny on the price of the car - they did throw in a $300 maintenance plan - and cleaned the HORRID cigarette smell out of the car and fixed a minor scratch on the mirror - (thankfully we requested that before we purchased the car).  I guess I could have understood if it had been weeks, even days after the purchase, but the next business day?  Well I guess you live and learn - used cars - what can you say.  I guess they must be hurting, because the cost of the cover was $13 (our cost) -  I realize it was my responsibility to check for that kind of stuff, but after hearing over and over about their ""safety inspection they do on certified cars"" well one would think that would have been looked at, guess not. So, if I ever purchase another used car you can bet I will know to pay more attention the next time...
We dealt with Nathan and Natalie in Finance and both did a great job.  Nathan came and picked up my car on Tuesday to get it cleaned up (we offered to leave it, but he said he would come get it from me, which I thought was very nice).  He then brought it back to me once it was cleaned up.  He also took the time to help me set up my phone with the blue tooth (really cool!) and I really appreciated that customer service.",4.2

190,"October 03, 2011","Well I went to this dealer w/o any idea of what I wanted. I just knew I wanted a new ride. After talking with Shaun and Mo, I drove a few, but Mo turns to me and says, ""I have the perfect vehicle for you!"" And since I hadn't fallen head over heels yet for a car that I had driven, I said sure.....Lets see it! Then here comes this sharp, sexy, sleek looking car that I never imagined was in my price range. And MO WAS INSIDE!!! It was the car he had in mind for me!!! I couldn't believe it. 
So after a short test drive to make sure that's the one for me......I purchased a Nissian Rogue!!!!  
I have to admitt Mo can pickem'!!!!!! And Shaun was a real delight to work with. What a positive group of people to purchase a car from. They deserve tons of kudos! 
Then Elliott worked us a great finance deal as well. I can't say enough positive things about Texas Nissian of Grapevine! I plan on telling as many folks that will listen.

In the end, I didn't purchase exactly the vehicle I was looking at, because the dealership ended up making a great deal on a newer 2010 Versa Hatchback with lower miles and better interior.  In the end, I'm extremely happy with the car and extremely happy with Josh's personality.  I've walked away from 3 other dealerships in the past 6 months, because of the ""salesman pushing"" me to make a deal that I was completely uncomfortable with.  Josh had a more human interest approach and didn't give off the same ""used car salesman"" vibes.  I hope he keeps that personality in future, because I personally hate dealing with ""salesmen"", but I'd work with Josh again in future.  Vince also made me feel very comfortable with the financing end, especially since I chose to accept higher payments for a shorter term, which means that with my driving habits, the car will probably still under warranty when it is paid off.",5.0
194,"September 29, 2011","My second time buying from this dealership was much better than the first time. The first time was forgettable due to the fact I wasn't told the car I originally bought had been in an accident, thus automatically lowering the value of it a great deal before I even left the lot. When I came back recently, I informed them that I had been sold the car at the price listed for a car in perfect condition without a history of an accident, but when I had been trying to trade it in to other dealerships they told me the Carfax showed it had been in an accident and I had not been told about that during the purchase.  The used car sales manager, Jason Neely, was quite rude and did not seem to care one bit that his company had sold a car to me at an exaggerated price and that they had left out crucial information that could have affected the sale/purchase.  As I was about to leave and contemplate my options, James Wiley talked to me and calmed me down as he could tell I was angry. He walked me over to the new car area, where he introduced me to the new car people. He was very helpful and made my experience much better, along with the new car guys and new car finance guy.

I wanted to explain why only ""Good"" in the overall category: The only reason they didn't get a ""Great"" rating here is the length of time to finish our purchase. We arrived at around 10am, and FINALLY left in our new car at 4:15pm. That is a LONG day... I understand the tactics behind the sales sheets, cross-outs, as well as the back and forth from manager/financier to customer as a tactic to a) keep you there longer so you can't car shop elsewhere; and b) to seem like they are working the best deal for you. -- I played the game and went through all of these things and honestly, in the end - I got an awesome car, with better warranties than I would have gotten with a new car. - And with these two friendly guys, there really was NO hassle with the negotiations.

Garret Elkins kept me informed and responded to my various requests for information regarding the vehicle, that I was considering purchasing. He always returned my telephone calls. He always kept me informed of any changes regarding the availability of the vehicle. His salesmanship and positive attitude were two of the reasons my daughter and I decided to drive 200 miles to Grapevine to view the vehicle,that I was considering buying. Garret meet us at the front door, of the dealership, with a positive attitude and cheerful smile. He made sure all of our needs were meet. After inspecting and driving the vehicle, and Garret arranging for the service department to resolve a couple of problems, I decided to purchase the vehicle. One problem was not resolved, but Garret handled the repair through a Ford/Lincoln Dealership in Austin. I truly appreciated and admired his diligence. I rented a vehicle to drive up to Grapevine, which cost me $140 out of my pocket. Garret was very helpful and offered to follow my daughter over to the DFW car rental site, so she could drop off the  rental vehicle, while I finished the paper work. It is hard to say a any price is ""great"". I rated the Quality of Work ""Great"" solely based on the outstanding qualities Of Garret Elkins. He is definitely an asset to the Texas Nissian of Grapevine Dealership. You are fortunate to have a young man of his qualifies working at your dealership.

When we stepped inside Texas Nissan I was put at ease with Nathan's calm personality and a cold water on a HOT Texas afternoon! We did not feel the pressure from Nathan as we did in other dealerships. He listened to what type of car we were looking for and how much we wanted to spend on it and he stayed in that range. Not once did he try to stear us to a higher priced car! We knew what we could spend and he respected that.  In fact, that is the key word here...RESPECT.  My husband and I felt that from the moment we met Nathan.  As we were finishing up with the paperwork on our car we met others in the company and were impressed with them as well.

216,"August 26, 2011"," There are a number of reasons to give glowing reports to any business that has sold you products.

The number one reason for this review is we wanted to make it known to any one looking for a car dealer who would go above and beyond your normal sales- This dealer is in our view , excellent and of the highest quality. Not only on the sales floor but after we drove the  car off the lot, they were still behind us backing up the sale one hundred and ten  percent. 

When buying the car, I waited to see what caliber of service I would receive after the sale. That is in fact what separates any car
dealer from the normal to the extraordinary. Texas Nissan has in every way reached that level of service for us, Extraordinary.
Not only doing what they had promised they would do, but going above and beyond my expectations.

They are a car dealer I  would gladly tell others about and even to encourage them to look at this dealer first.

The sales people were of the highest degree of earnest help and there entire focus was on wanting to make me a customer
that was completely satisfied, having no regrets or concerns that were not immediately dealt with. 

I fact , from the moment we entered Texas Nissan, we were treated with incredible care and personal attention. 
Our desire to find the perfect car for us was there only concern. 
They were professional , caring, and in every way did not remove there influence from the sale of the vehicle until I was completely 
satisfied . In fact , they are still there to help me if at any time I find that necessary .

Without a doubt , each and everyone that we dealt with made this car buying experience GREAT !
Texas Nissan has done Texas Proud !

222,"August 17, 2011","I bought the car in late June. Right after my purchase, my boyfriend got accepted to law school out of state. We moved almost instantaneously. Texas Nissan of Grapevine and the loan company they used (First Investors) took over two weeks to process my paperwork. By that time, I had given notice to my company and moved out of state. When First Investors finally called to verify employment, I of course was gone. They requested a letter from my former employer stating my last date of employment and a letter from my new employer, establishing current job employment. I provided both. I was told that the loan would then be restructured. Meanwhile, I get into a car wreck. While my insurance company was helpful and compliant, Texas Nissan was not. They dispatched an outside party to handle my 'case', a Mr. Joe Cortez, who sent me harassing phone calls and text messages, stating none of the above requested information had been received. Yet still I complied. Finally, tiresome of the run around I received, I called First Investors and spoke with them directly. They stated that there was a partial down payment outside of the loan itself (a pre-dated check I had given to TX Nissan as a partial down payment to help cover the upside down on my trade in.) that needed to clear before they would restructure, along with the new employment information. When I asked TX Nissan about this, they informed that they forgot to tell me to basically lie: ie, there was no outstanding checks with the dealership, that the loan was clear cut and ready to go. When I was finally told that everything was due to be re-submitted (and my second check about to clear) I woke up to find the vehicle repossesed. I was unable to get ahold of anyone at the dealership to get a clear answer; the 'Mr. Cortez' I was told worked at the dealership did not actually work there and the dealership still tried to cash my check for the partial payment. Luckily, by then I had the sense to cancel that check. Three days later, I get ahold of the director of the dealership who says they would be willing to cooperate with me and give me my trade back. I accepted that the down payment I made was not going to be returned. But when I followed up to get my trade back, I couldn't get ahold of anyone. Concurrently, they never paid off my previous loan and I am still responsible for paying them (despite the fact that they have my trade.) When I informed my loan company that I didn't have the vehicle, the trade, they did their own investigation and found out TX Nissan had auctioned off my trade (despite telling me they would cooperate with me) and, despite the fact that they DIDNT OWN THE PINK SLIP TO THE VEHICLE. Currently, I have no vehicles, I am still on the hook for my previous loan (which is completely late because I BOUGHT A NEW CAR) I'm on the verge of it being charged off and now have to take legal recourse against the dealership in order to protect my credit and my ability to get any new vehicle in the future.

Despite our asking to see vehicles with under 50K miles for around $10,000 we were first shown a vehicle with 97K miles. The second vehicle we were shown had no AC. The third vehicle was finally closer to what we were looking for, but it took repeating ourselves a few times (I had mentioned liking Versas from the very beginning, but did not get offered to see one until the 4th car, and even then it was only because I specifcally asked) before we were finally shown something we would seriously consider. When we finally found what we liked it seemed as though the dealership was intent on making a sale without allowing us to really even find out what else was available or consider other options. 

In addition, despite my many detailed questions, I did not feel like they were answered very clearly which made it difficult to trust the salesmen. There were some things that did not get discussed at all, which was disappointing as it was my first vehicle purchase and I would have liked further explanation on some things such as whether or not the new car would be insured until I could add it to my existing policy, and when and how I would be able get the permanent license plates for the vehicle. Had I thought to ask these questions at the time, I would have, but so much of the time I was waiting for a salesmen to return from consulting with his manager that when I did think of these questions there was not someone in front of me to ask. By the time the sale finally went through I had spent over four hours waiting and just wanted to leave as soon as possible. Maybe this is par for the course in purchasing vehicles, but as a first time buyer I did not expect to spend four hours in the negotiation and purchasing process alone, in addition to the couple of hours spent finding the vehicle I wanted to purchase. 

It was also very disappointed to find out that the prices advertised online for the certified used vehicles are actually the prices the dealer paid for the vehicles rather than what the vehicles actually will be sold for. There is a huge difference in the price my vehicle was listed as ($13,999) and what I ended up paying (about $18,600). I can only hope that I was not taken advantage of as I was repeatedly told that the advertised price of the car is not even close to the actual price of the car. I was told all used dealerships falsely advertise this way, but even if that's true, it's very disconcerting to see one price end up paying over $4,500 more, whether it's ""certified"" or not. It would have been nice to have been told this when we were looking at cars, rather than afterwards during the negotiation process. When we asked how much vehicles cost while looking at vehicles we did not get straight answers at all, so that made it very difficult to decide if we could be serious about purchasing the vehicle or not. To help solve this problem, the salesmen urged us to get inside to ""run numbers"" but running numbers only turned into them trying to sell me the car, when I wasn't even sure if it was a viable option since I still didn't know it cost around $18,000 instead of $14,000. The whole process of trying to ""run the numbers"" before knowing what things cost appears very dishonest to the customer, despite whether they are looking for a specific price, or if they are more worried about the monthly car payment as I was. I knew what prices I could afford based on the total price of the car, the rate I had been offered, and the monthly payment that would result, yet I was still given the ""run around"" regarding the prices of the cars merely because I mentioned that the monthly payment was my biggest concern. Yes, I was less concerned about the total price, but a higher totally price will obviously make the monthly payments be higher than I want to pay, despite how we ""run the numbers"". Regardless, I was told the numbers could be messed with to suit my needs and in the end, while I am happy with my purchase, the numbers did not end up anywhere close to where I wanted. I had not even confirmed with the salesmen that I would be willing purchase for the price he showed me when he sent me to ""work with the numbers"" with the finance manager. When I arrived to the finance department, it was assumed I had already agreed to purchase even though I was still not satisfied with the options I'd been given. In all honesty I would have liked to look at more cars, but I had already been pushed to the final processes of the sale, and had spent many hours waiting, so I decided to go ahead with the purchase. 

Overall, my experience was ok because I ended up getting a car I really enjoy for a decent price. I just wish it would have taken a lot less time and that the process had been more straight forward. Again, both Josh and Garrett were very friendly and helpful, however, had they listened more closely to what I really wanted as a customer rather than showing me a car I liked that was outside of my price range then assuring me they could ""work out the numbers"" when in reality they could not (because it's not possible to make an $18,000 car fit into $200 car payments), my experience would have been better.

239,"July 23, 2011","Worst dealership experience I have ever had! Drove all the way from Austin, TX to purchase a vehicle we found online. When we arrived at the dealership we were told the car had been sold, even though we called the previous night RIGHT before closing and were told it was available. They showed us another vehicle we saw online for around 10k. The thing is the price was increased to 14k due to additional &quot;certification&quot; fee that is added to all of their vehicles. When I asked why the car was advertised online for less the salesman replied &quot;all dealerships do this&quot; this is how we stay competitive. 

After sitting in their office for 7 hours, between 4 to 5 trips to the manager to settle on a price, we decided on a vehicle. We only received one key for the vehicle. I called numerous times trying to get a hold of the salesperson who sold us the car. Not once did he return my call. After growing tired of this I contacted someone else who did his work for me telling me they only had one key. 

We were then contacted by them advising us that we needed to get the car inspected so they could issue the plates, which they were a month late getting them to us and had to issue us two extension plates. We were told that we would be refunded the $30 for the inspection. I submitted the receipts by fax and mail. Waited a few weeks and received nothing. I called and talked to the gentleman who requested the information. He said he had received it and would get the check out that afternoon. It is 4 months later and I still have not received the check. 

This is the WORST dealership I have ever done business with and would highly recommend that you look elsewhere. The sales people are very very pushy and will not let you leave once you are cornered in their office. They have ZERO customer service after the sale and NO ONE wants to return any of your calls. I have been very patient with these people and this is the first time I have ever written a review online. I feel this is information someone should know before they decide to put down tens of thousands of dollars for a new or used vehicle. There are plenty of good dealerships in the Dallas area.

He asked what I was looking for then went around his whole inventory.  He picked a vehicle he felt matched our description and before I told him i thought it was perfect, he guaranteed me that if this did not meet my needs he would be more than happy to show me every car on the lot.  When we decided on the vehicle he showed me and we started talking financing he was very respectful of the fact that i had my financing lined up with my bank and politely asked me if they could beat the terms if I would give them my business.  They were able to make the numbers work and we were able to drive home with the new Versa that night.  Because we arrived at the dealer so late, we ended up finishing up all the paperwork for the financing well after close and while he wasn't the one doing the paperwork with me, Nathan stayed until everything was done so he could hand me the keys and ensure that everything met our expectations.  I have bought a few used vehicles in the past from other dealers and this was a completely different experience.

256,"July 11, 2011","Used car dealership specializes in high velocity sales, originally we went to this dealership to look at two models that were listed as available and confirmed via phone as on the lot. When we arrived both were nowhere to be found. Regardless they had a great selection of other vehicles, again big plus when dealing with a high velocity lot like this one. Ended up test driving two cars, first was mechanically flawed (not really sure how it passed inspection, it needed some work), second was a true gem. After deciding this was something worth pursuing we started talking numbers. I was blown away at the marketing tactics of this dealership to low ball customers in with an amazing internet rate only to jack it up by 18% with so called “options”. The internet rate will be significantly lower than KBB. They get back to the KBB number and more via “options” watch out for this! This seemed rather unethical and somewhat reminiscent of bait and switch tactics. In the end they were able to remove the bulk of these “options” and give me a more than fair trade in value to make up for it. If you are not prepared to invest some time researching what you’ve got, what the fair market prices are and even more time talking through the options with their sales team I would avoid this place, it simply will not be a good fit for you.

Nathan showed us the package options and color choices and we immediately liked the 2011 Murano SV so he made arrangements for one to be brought in from another location.  Steven set up the financing at a lower interest rate and made arrangements for the majority of the payoff value for our Altima to be added to the new loan so we still have only one car payment that we can afford.  Calculating in the promotional discounts they offered and the trade-in value from the Kia, we left with the contract we wanted and are happy to be driving a 2012 Altima loaner vehicle until our new Murano arrives later in the week.

279,"May 13, 2011","The customer service there is horrible! They don't listen to what you have to say and only want to sell their overpriced cars. I had told the first saleman that your dealership doesn't have what I'm looking for, which is a budget of $8,000. He had the keys to my car because were going to trade our in for another car. He wouldn't give the keys back and had his manager speak to us. They insisted to tell us the cars are overpriced because of what happened in Japan, which I understood. I told them I understood this, but I was looking for a used car. They kept showing me overpriced new cars. We took a look out on the lot again because the manager said there would be cars in our price range. When we went and looked there was none, and they were still overpriced. We looked at a lancer and test drove it. The price for it was around $15,000, but when when we looked up the kelly bluebook value it was worth 13,000. Then they said they had a camry for $8,000 that just came in. So we took a look at it. This was with another salesman. After looking at it, the manager said the trade in value of my vehicle subtracted from the price of the car would be $10,500. When I asked what my vehicle was appraised for, they couldn't give me an answer and said that's what the price of the car would be with the trade. This goes to show you that they just want to sell cars. When I got home, I looked up the value of the 2002 Camry they tried to sell me. I had asked for the VIN number from the salesman just for that reason. I looked up the standard presumptive value of the vehicle on the Texas Department of Motor Vehicle's website, and the value of the car is $5,838. They totally tried to rip me off. On top of that my car is worth $2,700, so if you subtract that from $5,838 it would be $3,138. I know they need to make a profit but doubling the price and not giving the value of my car what it's worth is a total rip off. I am so pissed, they wasted an hour and a half of my time!!! I had told them numerous times I wasn't interested in any of their cars and that I was hungry and wanted to grab dinner. But they were pushy!!! I didn't want to be rude so I tried to tell politely each time. Now I know with car salesman, you can't be nice to them at all. They will try to take advantage of you. Especially since I'm a girl, they thought they could pull one over. They didn't, but they wasted my time. They are very unprofessional and not sincere at all. Maybe because of their attitudes, their cars aren't getting sold and that's why they need to hold their customers hostage in order to make a sale. On top of that, I saw a salesman walk out of the women's restroom.....how very unprofessional!!! Never buy a car from them, they will rip you off!!! I am so upset that I will keep posting my reviews on many sites so people will know how bad their customer service is. I wanted to send an email to the manager and give him a piece of my mind, but I didn't grab a card. The reason being I didn't want one. If I were to call, it would just reach the call center and I wouldn't be able to speak with the manager because he would just ignore my call. I hope the manager and his entire staff gets fired. I should write a letter to Nissan Corporate to let them know how I was treated. Others should do so also!!! ",1.0

They were all very helpful in all areas.  Stuart went even steps further by helping keep my 19 month old grandon, Zain, happy with hugs, balloons, rides in the stroller, you name it.  I would definitely recommend this dealership and these employees to all of my friends.  I am going to be in the market for another new car in about a year and I need an SUV.  I want either a GMC Denali Acadia or Toyota Landcruiser.  However, because of my WONDERFUL experience, I may reconsider my decision and look at a Nissan SUV.

281,"May 04, 2011","I was very disappointed with Texas Nissan of Grapevine's transparency regarding the actual vehicles they have on-site versus what they advertise. I live about 40 miles from the dealership, so I called ahead to verify that two Acura TLs I saw advertised (autotrader.com) were still available at the dealership. I was assured by Vanessa (who answered the phone) that they not only had the two cars I saw, but also three others (total of FIVE Acura TLs on site). When I arrived, I was informed by PJ that the dealership had no TLs. I can certainly understand selling 1-2 vehicles in the two hours between my call and my arrival at the dealership, but to have ZERO of the five was quite upsetting. I asked how this could have happened and was given the run-around. I was then referred to two ""sister"" dealerships (supposedly owned by the same company) on the other side of highway 114 as they might have the five mystery TLs. I asked both PJ and Garrett to check if the sister dealerships had these vehicles before I drove over there - I was again given the run-around and told they couldn't check for me. So I drove to the ""sister"" dealerships in hopes that my 80 mile round trip was not a complete loss. After a brief talk with two salesmen (one at each dealership), I was told that one of the dealerships was not a ""sister"" company after all and that Texas Nissan of Grapevine often ""misleads potential customers about the actual invesntory"". I know that you'd be naive to expect real honesty from a salesman when negotiating the price of a car, but you should at least expect honesty enough when it comes to whether or not the dealership actually has a car. If you see an online advertisement for a car at this dealership, just know that a simple phone call won't be enough to verify whether the car ""actually"" exists or if its a phony (false)advertisement. I would recommend that you steer clear of this dealership as their questionable business practices may not stop with phony advertisements.",2.0

I showed up at the dealer in the next couple of hours and told them the three cars I wanted to look at, to my surprise the salesmen said all had been sold earlier in the week and were long gone even though I was told they were avialable.

They kept insisting I did not know what I wanted and said they were showing me a car within the price point, only to find out that was NOT the car that was online.

The car that I ended up buying was a little more than what I anticipated spending, BUT we were able to work it out to where I was within my monthly payment range. I definitely ended up with an amazing car for the payment I was looking for. The car had some significant scratches before the sale but after filling out the WE OWE and taking it in the next day, the car looks close to brand new.

304,"February 14, 2011","Jordan was arrogant, rude, and deceitful from the very beginning. He was significantly more concerned with boasting of his sales successes from the weekend, rather than listening to my needs.
I asked to have my vehicle evaluated for possible trade. As it is relatively new Jordan asked for my payoff information. I politely explained that I would simply like to know what the dealership would consider as fair trade in value. Jordan argued and pressed me for the payoff details.I then asked for pricing on 3 vehicles parked in the used lot. Jordan refused to provide pricing for the vehicles. As I attempted to explain that I would need to know the vehicle prices before deciding on possible purchase candidates, Jordan became rude and aggressive towards both myself and my wife. Jordan interrupted me yet again, to insist that I test drive a vehicle prior to ANY price discussions. At this point I asked Jordan to return the keys to my vehicle (in back being evaluated). I explained that I was uncomfortable with the aggressive nature of the conversation and would like to look elsewhere. Jordan responded by cursing at me (in front of my wife) and storming into the sales managers office. I followed Jordan to the sales managers office, as I now wanted to detail my experience to his manager. Upon entering the office, Jordan literally threw my keys at me and told me to ""get out"". While the sales manager was somewhat apologetic for Jordan's behavior, he continually defended him by saying Jordan is a ""great guy"". Apparently we have vastly differing opinions of what makes a ""great guy"". My definition does not include cursing in front of females or treating prospective clients with disrespect.

305,"February 12, 2011"," I have purchased six cars in my lifetime, four were new car purchases, I brought my grandaughter to Nissan of Grapevine to purchase her very first car; this was the most unprofessional, negative and distasteful experience with a dealership that I have ever encountered. They have totally destroyed my granddaughter's ""first car buy ""experience.
The salesmen, finance department, and management were rude, unprofessional and deceitful. They were primarily concerned with there own profit. I asked for a car within a certain price range, they would not disclose any prices, instead, they were only concerned with how much I was willing to pay monthly and the amount of my downpayment. They tried to defer me from purchasing their inventory within my price range, stating that the car wouldnot be reliable, yet they advertised those very unreliable cars on the internet.
When they finally diclosed a price that I was comfortable with, they increased the price of the vehicle by $1400 dollars citing checkpoint repairs and car detail as the reason. The car was not certified. At that point I was going to decline the sale but I didnot want to disappoint my granddaughter. After agreeing on the price, I was told that my granddaughter could ""drive away with the car"" after financing.
In finance, I requested a purchase order to submit to my credit union, the finance manager insisted on ""running the paperwork"" through the credit union for me. I submitted a $3500 dollar check and $500 dollars cash as a downpayment.
After completing the paper work, the salesman, ""Billy,"" informed me that my grandaughter could not take the car home because they needed to ""detail the car and complete work"" on the car, which he previously stated was already completed.
I have never been so disappointed and felt so deceived by a company that boast of being the ""top dealership in the US.""
The next day I was told that my credit application with the credit union was declined, so I requested my downpayment refund from Grapevine Nissan's finanicial managers,  James Ogola and Shawn Hodges, they were both unsympathetic to my needs and refused the refund stating I was approved by another financial institution, which I didnot request. I specified financing by the credit union, and if James had not insisted upon processing the application, for the benefit of himself and the company, I would not have the problem of fighting to get back the $500 dollars cash that rightfully belongs to my granddaughter.I never once had possession of the automobile, I was denied credit by the credit union and I didnot ask the company to submit my application to any other financial institutions so therefore, I am entitled to a refund of my downpayment. 
These employees were all inconsiderate and  unprofessional; they were only concerned about themselves, they never once put the needs of me and my granddaughter first.

I was looking for a car for my 18 years old. My budget was $5000-$7000 in cash. I did not want to finance because insurance would be expensive.
Last December, I found few cars at Nissan Grapevine website so I called them and I went to see it next day. They told me both cars were sold out. I understood. I gave sales man my phone number so that he could call me when he got new cars. He never called me back. Two weeks later, I found an another cars on their website.

He gave me a funny look and did not even know about those cars. Instead he recommended me an another car. I said No! and I told him to show me the cars I was interested in. He also asked me how I planned to pay. I said cash then he said ""why don't you save those cash for something else and finance"" I know that dealer make more money on finance than cash, but I had a reason not to finance. Anyway, he left to check for those cars, and came back and told me that both of the cars were in process of purchase right now. It was very hard to believe. I asked him to show me all the cars on their website.He had nothing to show me except 2006 Altima with big DENT on drivers side. I asked him how much and he would not tell me the price.Instead he wanted to know how much I would pay for it.  I noticed that those website ads were just bait so that they could attract customers to come to their lot and sell something else.

315,"December 16, 2010"," has been one of the worse experience in my life this dealership not only dont explain exactly what the price is they also increase the price in $ 3,000 or 4,000 dollars more. they neve explain to you that the nissan bank dont give loans amount for under $ 7,000 and they put lots of warranties in the vehicle that match such amount. the manager of used cars never told me about this. after they offer to you the sky and the stars when you want to return or call for an explanation they kick your butt like piece of trash.it happened to me I drove from waco tx trying to return the car 3 days after the deal was closed and even when i called the next businness day they never gave the chance or was told that i have to be in person to return the vehicle when i spoken with one of the top guys in that dealership i was kicked out the office with no explanation at all.and the worse part this person said to call ""manager.""

I have been begging for anyone to go over my invoice of $900 after two weeks of no returned phone calls by the ""designated"" service assistant...well, guess what, he was no longer with the company, I learned after. His voicemail was still saying"" You have reached Desmond...etc""  The Service manager that calls with a recorded message at your house to say "" Thank you bla bla, call if you have issues"" well, I called him hoping he will live up to the promises on the recording. His name is Shannon Grape. Guess what he called back only after 4 days and three voicemails just to tell me,  sorry I am busy I will call you on Monday and NEVER called back. I called back , I am not kidding, 10 more times. NOTHING! They only got $1800 from me ($900 paid by me and the rest covered by my extended warranty) Very disappointed and just feeling helpless about it. I work for Mercedes and this could never happen ...and if it did, someone would be fired. Customer is always first. And at the end I wonder if this was going to happen if I was a man.... I will never take my car back there. I wish I could give a  ZERO rating.

317,"December 06, 2010","Texas Nissan of Grapevine listed a 2007 Altima 2.5S with 30k miles for $11,959 on various car shopping websites. We arrived at the dealership and test drove the vehicle. The salesman asked how much we would pay for the vehicle and we told him we would pay the asking price plus TTL. After playing the car sales shuffle, the salesman returned and told us they had $15,999 in the vehicle and if we bought it at that price the dealership would only make $15. I suggested that whoever is pricing the cars on the internet should be fired. After it was obvious to all concerned that we would not be purchasing this vehicle, the salesman tried to interest us in another car to no avail. I now know this is their way of doing business. As we were leaving, the salesman told me if I found another vehicle on the internet priced at their dealership to call him and he would tell me the real price. Their business practices may be legal, but I don't see how they could be considered honest. I consider it to be false advertising. They can apparantly get by with it because of the fine print concerning dealer add-ons, certification, etc. Based on the CarFax report the dealership had installed floor mats, VIN etching, changed the oil and filter and lubed the chassis, and performed a state inspection. I will not be driving the 100+ miles to have this dealership raise the price on the car I'm interested in and then try to sell me one that I won't even consider.",1.5
318,"October 30, 2010"," I recently leased a 2011 Nissan from Grapevine Nissan. To make this short, I visited the showroom on September 4, 2010. I was given a price based on my good credit with Infinity Financial, ""tier 2"". I told them I would need to think about it, and I would return the next day. I did not return until Labor Day. After approximately 4 hours of the dog and pony show trying to get to the ""bottom line"", I was told that I should have bought the car when I first came in, because my credit tier was no longer a tier 2, but had gone to a tier 4. Yes, I had the right to leave, but they convinced me, that it would only continue to go up. 

I leased the car, and the next day one of the salesmen came to my place of employment telling me they needed to change something on the contract and it was just minor, and I believe I made a mistake in having signed.

After several attempts to speak with someone at Nissan/Infinity financial to discuss why my credit score went down overnight, no one would speak with me. I could only get through to a outsource in India and they said they were customer service and there were no supervisors. I called again, only when it had the option of press two ""if you are a dealership"", I went with that option. I was immediately connected with a very nice local English speaking person. They simply asked for my social security number and promptly gave me my ""Tier 2"" credit score. I of course had to say I was a dealership to get the information. After the woman gave me the credit score, I explained my situation. I asked her if she would testify to my score. She said, ""Yes"", and gave me her name and number. I was also told I would have 30 days to secure a new lease/purchase at the tier 2 credit score.

Today, when this was reported to the Grapevine Dealership, Mr. Johnny Cantrell couldn't have been any ruder. I was appalled. The entire conversation was reordered. The man was so crazed I thought he was under the influence.   I am sure no one would ever believe how this man treated me, but lucky for my sanity, the entire conversation was recorded.  Would he have treated me the same way if I had a man with me?

Yes, Mr. Cantrell, I could have walked away when quoted the higher price and should have. If any woman is reading this, I strongly encourage you to run or take a lawyere with you at the time of purchase.   ",1.4
319,"October 13, 2010",I’ve been shopping around different dealerships to see which one has the best offer for the car I want. I finally narrowed down to selection and chose Texas Nissan Of Grapevine. They have more options and the financing team seems more knowledgeable compared to other dealerships. Biggest compliment for them is the superb customer service I’ve received during my visit. Kuddos to that! I will recommend this dealership to others for sure!,5.0
320,"October 03, 2010","The score for this dealership was completely different two days ago. We knew that going in, but wanted to look at a vehicle they had listed for 13,9. We knew we weren't playing around, I had to find a car. I had know the games, thought I knew better. This wasn't my first rodeo in buying a car. They DO NOT have any cars that you will find on internet for those prices. They have a hooptie line with very old cars, but nothing even close to what they advertise. They will get you in there and do the old style haggle with paper, cross out, and leave you hanging. You'll say you're only staying a short time, and they say you can't buy a car in five minutes. They spoke badly about another dealership that we were approved at. You can tell them what you WANT to afford,(15K is what we wanted to buy at) even though you have been approved elsewhere for more. It won't matter. They will bring a car up from the back and tell you what a great deal they can give you, but it will be WAY over what you told them you wanted to afford. (20K) They will keep you there for HOURS, for nothing, just running for one minute to do this or that. We knew better, and STILL got bs'd. If you've got all day and feel like the old school bs buying~ this is your place. We HAD all of the information for the cars they were listing~yet funny enough, those prices didn't include the certifcation for used vehicles. That adds another 3K.

Looking online I found a Nissan Sentra fully loaded l5k miles and very reasonable price.(11,495) At Texas Nissan 1401 West Hwy 114 Grapevine, TX Called to verify it was in stock.(all calls monitored for quality customer service)  The operator suggested I make an appointment.   I asked if the car was in stock she said ""yes"". She stated ""If the car sells before your scheduled appointment we will do what ever we can to put you in another vehicle""  Red flag!!! I asked her for the name of a particular salesperson to ask for upon my arrival.She provided me with no contact name....Instead I was issued a ""secret"" 9 digit number. She said ""Just present the salesperson with this number and that is all  you need. I took my title and a blank check as I planned to pay cash for the car with or without my trade.
I drove the 32  miles to Grapevine where I was greeted with festive balloons tied to various cars on the lot.(Balloons... another red flag)  
I entered the used car dept and stood for a few minutes. I walked down the hallway and opened the back door to find two salesman standing in the shade of the building. I asked if they were salesmen? I told them what I was there for and gave them my ""secret number."" I could tell from their expression they had no idea what I was talking about. He looked on the sales board and in the inventory computer. No car fitting that description was in stock. He informed me that he thought it  has been sold ""But I have a 2007 with 46,000 miles I could show you."" he offered. I explained I had driven the distance as I wanted to see  THAT car. I politely thanked him explained I had enjoyed the 45 minute drive to Grapevine as I walked to my beautiful 2001 Honda with 113,000 miles, a few whiskey dents and bird poop burned on the hood from the intense Texas heat. I then called the 866 number ( call recorded for quality customer service) 3rd red flag! The operator sounded as if she was a 13 yr old girl waiting for her daddy to get off work  and for fun she was allowed to answer the phone ( joint custody I am sure.) I offered my "" secret number"" for verification but she was no help. I then asked to speak to the internet sales manager. I explained my issues politely and he said "" We will try what ever we can to get you in a car today"" I explained I would enjoy the scenic drive back to Dallas to Trophy Nissan as I would be reluctant to do business with a dealership that had wasted my time when I had followed all of the necessary procedures to utilize my limited time on a Saturday. After returning home I went to Cars.Com the the posting of my dream Sentra. I entered a fictitious name and my phone number indicating I was a ""doctor"" and wanted to look at the same car for my ""daughter who was in college"" I promptly received a call on my cell phone. When I asked about the car I was told ""it was sold but I have a few more I can show you"". He then suggested the black one with 46,000 miles .  Blah blah blah.
 I am actually happy  that the car  of my desires was not in their inventory as I would have slit my throat first before having to give any of my money to them. The best feeling I had from this experience is the satisfaction I got looking in my rear view mirror at  that dealership TEXAS NISSAN 1401 west HWY 114 Grapevine TX 866-559-3413 ( remember all calls monitored for quality customer service) as I drove away with my blank check in my wallet and the title in the glove box of my old reliable Honda.",1.0

Started off with their website advertising vehicles on the site for one price and when you get there, the vehicle is a higher price because they added THOUSANDS of dollars worth of OPTIONAL equipment. The first car was of course ""just sold"" so they had to look at another vehicle which was of course more expensive. Financing was a total scam. They were told they could only secure financing through one place and ironically my sister just got a letter in the mail advising her of her dealership approval through Chase. (they didn't tell my sister about that one). Turns out they had my sister finance at a higher interest rate than what Chase was offering.

345,"August 19, 2010","Salesman Nathan Glass was friendly, informative, and not pushy.  It was very  appreciated.

Internet Pricing is mis-leading at best.  They publish an internet price for a used car....the fine print says it doesn't include certification,  then they add $2500 to the internet price for the used car certification.  So you really can't buy it for anywhere near the advertised internet price.   Deceptive advertising.  You might as well advertise it for $1 and add $16,000 for certification.  Is there any difference?  Net result, you're not going to buy a certified used car for the advertised internet price.   It just won't happen.

I can't attest to whether all other dealers do their internet  pricing this way but this is just plain bad sales practice.  It doesn't inspire confidence in the dealership if you think you've been mis-lead.  

Lastly, I went to see a used vehicle they had advertised on the internet.  It was gone.  In fact, of the 6 used vehicles that I was interested in,  NONE were present.  Apparently they don't remove them from their website until they get paid for the car.  Either way, they're advertising more vehicles than they have.  Again, somewhat deceptive.

your typical used car salesman.(How did he know what i was thinking Ha)

He asked all the right questions about what we were looking for and the the price limit we had set.

He found exactly what my son was looking for and never tried to push us into a car we
werent interested in.

The purchase of our new car could not have gone smoother 
From the moment we walked in until we drove off the lot, our experience in each

My experience with them was nothing close to that, from day 1 when I bought my car from them in February 2004 I have had nothing but awesome encounters with.  The sales process went smooth, they call me every now and then to check on me and my car and I bring it in for service and oil changes.  The service department has always been quick even without an appointment and the people are soooo super nice.  They will not screw you over with their service rates either.

372,"August 07, 2010","My wife and I just purchased a new Armada from Texas Nissan.  We had been looking for several weeks and decided to head out to Texas Nissan to look at their inventory.  At first we were set on buying a pre-owned vehicle but did not see one that we liked on the lot.  Therefore, we decided to look into purchasing a new one.  Our salesman, Nathan Glass and Jordan, did an awesome job locating the vehicle we wanted and getting it within the price range we could afford.  Gregg, one of the sales managers at Texas Nissan, was also very, very helpful during the process and we would definitely say that our car buying experience was a great one.  Probably what I was most pleased with during the process was how nice and patient everyone in the entire dealership was.  My wife and I could not find a babysitter for the day and we had our 2 year old daughter with us.  We were worried at first about how she would act during the process but everyone was extremely nice to her and as a parent that truly meant a lot to me.

These guys are crooks!!

After extensive research, we settled on this dealership, enticed by their great online prices and drove 200miles to take a look. We called en-route to confirm the availability of some specific models we had settled on and this Logan guy confirmed the availability of three such models. Upon further elaborating our budget, continued on to state that we could work out a reasonable price especially given it was the end of the month.
Well, we did get there and unfortunately, that's where the niceties ended. We found the models and test drove one of them before proceeding to get down to the numbers.
 The process that ensued was both shocking and depressing. Like most of the dealerships, they have a fine print disclaimer on each of their cars stating that the price does not include tag, and taxes ....yadi yada. We do know that taxed and some dealer costs are to be expected of any car buying process. What we did not expect was $4200 to be slapped in addition to the online price stating that the cars were certified, essentially forcing customers to pay for warranties on a car that is still under manufacturer's warranty. This is not that 150 point inspection that most places do, but the full extended 50000 mile. The manufacturer's CVT transmission alone has a factory 120,000 mile warranty. Why would they conceal this charge and make me drive 200 miles before disclosing this. Common courtesy would lead you to believe that you should to let a client know explicitly when a certain model they are looking for is beyond their budget. Instead, Logan and his cronies led us to believe we could get a specific vehicle in our price range (Mind you there were several other parties around Dallas that had the model for this price, and at similar mileage levels too).
To make matters worse, these guys will lie just to get you to come to their dealership. They have over 10 extremely well priced vehicles on their website, as of today, yet when you walk in, they nonchalantly tell you that they are all sold, essentially a bait and switch tactic!!
There are thousands of dealerships in Texas. I could have done without all the lies, waste of time and money.
About 30minutes later in Dallas, a Honda dealer closed immediately on a deal after confirming the price we saw online, for $700 below listing price, and were both courteous and forthcoming; but that is a story of another listing.
I just want to saw shame on Nissan of Grapevine. Your tactics are a disgrace, and you need to realize that the way you do business plays a role in your future business.",2.0
375,"July 26, 2010","My overall experience at Texas Nissan of Grapevine was AMAZING!!!  I'm sure I wasn't an easy customer at all and never have been, but Dwight Walker made sure he took the time to make sure I got what I wanted and within my price range and was very patient and kind throughout the whole process.  I had a tough deal for Dwight to work out, negative equity in my current car but really wanted an SUV with no down and a monthly payment within the same range, he got a few people working the deal with him, but finally he was able to make it happen.  Dwight Walker went above and beyond!  Dwight sold me a car back in 2006, I was extremely impressed with him then, and even more impressed with him now.  I feel the worst part about buying a car is going into that finance office, however, Nancy Suarez made the process seamless, she explained everything didn't try to make me buy a warranty or package I didn't need, she was looking out for my best interest and didn't try to make me pay for something I wouldn't need, this was the first time I have ever worked with Nancy and I was impressed by how she took the time to explain everything to me instead of throwing paper at me and asking me to sign.

384,"March 28, 2010","This was by far the worst experience of buying a car that u could possibly imagine.  I met up with my wife and sister at the dealership after they had found a car that my wife wanted.  They had been at the dealership for over two hours before I arrived.  The sales people were very rude and did not have very good business ethics.  We test drove a vehicle.  The car was good but, after further inspection of the vehicle we noticed that the car had considerable rust damage and all around paint damage.  We proceeded anyway to find out if we could purchase the vehicle and work around the damages.  Although ugly were very fixable.  They tried to tell us that our trade-in vehicle had a dirty carfax report, which we knew was a total lie because we had pulled the report before ever going to a adealership.  Then they tried to gain personal information which they do not need to tell you numbers on a car.  When they figured out that they could not fool us with there amateur car sales tricks they became very rude and hateful towards us.  So in my opinion, this is not a dealership I would recommend to anyone.  Our experiences there almost ruined us even thinking about trading our vehicle.  Also in the stages of coming to numbers.  They tried to pull a 3100 dollar certified fee on the car.  My thing is why if they have a car on the lot that is supposed to be certified, why are they trying to charge an extra 3100 to their new potential customers.  Seems like someone is trying to line their own pockets.",1.0
385,"March 18, 2010","Just barely avoided a scam here. They tried to charge me a hidden $3100 for ""certification"" on a $9500 used car last minute. They tried to speak in financing terms instead of cash terms to try to confuse us. 

It was very obvious that they tried to hide this charge. Seconds from closing, I asked the salesman to repeat what he said three times, then had to take the pen into my own hand and write it out only to have them avoid what I was writing and talk about how wonderful certification was.. which may be true, but it wasn't optional, therefore our 3 hour visit, drive down there, negotiations, etc were all wasted because we never knew the real price. 

The internet sales guy, Dustin, seemed to get it, his demeanor and facial expressions gave it away. I've very keen on those things. He never said it out loud and wasn't about to question his boss.

Once we realized what was going on we decided to walk. Then in a last minute attempt to save the sale the owner, Johnny came out and spoke with us for the first time and thought a good idea would be to be rude to my wife and question my intelligence. Then tried to pretty much get in a fight saying that I was insulting his integrity, etc, etc.

I went in, test drove it and went to crunch numbers with the salesman. I had 5000 to put down on the vehicle and wanted to stay under 15000 after all fees and add ons. They got it to 15700 which I agreed to and it was downhill from there! I signed papers and as a first time buyer asked a lot of questions, but misread the paperwork which they were expecting I'm sure. They ended up charging me full sticker price of 19000! So once I realized my mistake I tried to rectify the situation. I called 4 different people and left multiple messages, it took a week to get a hold of someone and all they did was point fingers at each other over thwe multiple mistakes. They refused to give me an itimized list of what was included in the car price. I set up MMP insurance for oil changes and it took them a month to even turn in the paperwork!

My first payment was over a month after I signed paperwork and I was told I had to make my first payment myself! They took almost a month to get that in too!

388,"March 06, 2010","HORRIBLE dealership. In the year 2010, one would assume you could easily purchase a car online via the internet. I find the car I want with Texas Nissan that is fairly priced which leads me to contact them. I hear back from Brian in the PreOwned Dept and he won't specify if the vehicle is available or not but ""there are 3 of them"". Today, after driving 40 miles 1 way to the dealership, the salesman said they didn't have any in stock but even worse, the $14,995 ""internet price"" doesn't include their certification price which would ""add about $3,000"" onto the price of the car. Not that $17.9 was out of my price range, it's just the fact that EVERY vehicle on their Web site lists the ""internet price"" with me knowing that tons of ppl come in there due to the bait only to find out that the car isn't available but even worse, was really never available at the price that was offered online.

Because I work in a legal marketing role, I'm quite aware of Terms & Conditions so I ventured back to the Web site to see where I went wrong:
The prices and incentives shown above may vary from region to region and are subject to change.  Inventory is subject to prior sale.  Vehicle information is based on standard equipment and may vary from vehicle to vehicle.  Please contact us via phone or email for specific vehicle information.  All prices plus tax, title, license, dealer adds and documentation fee.  Any discounted prices may include rebates.

Buyer beware, ""Fees"" can range up to $3000 per vehicle for Nissan certification (which doesn't get you anything like BMW Certified Pre-Owned will get you)...just a stamp on paper that says it has gone thru the Nissan shop and they'll cover your powertrain up to 100,000 miles.

Jason, their preowned sales manager, says they're just ""trying to be competitive but not deceitful in tehir marketing practices"" but of course, honesty is somewhat of a gray area for most car dealers. Your money and time is better spent at a dealership that doesn't involve Texas Nissan of Grapevine or any dealership that adopts comparable practices.",1.0

I understand sales people want the sale that day but when I went to Texas Nissan of Grapevine I met a sales person (Ray Beavers) who seemed to take a different approach.  He was very personable and not pushy at all.  He listened and tried to help me make a good decision based on the information I gave him as to what would work best for me.  He didn't push me into buying but rather helped me to weigh my options.  He's been w/ Nissan a long time and I appreciated his courtesy approach and his knowledge of the products.  He let me take the vehicle for a few hours to think about my decision away from the dealership so that I didn't make a rushed decision.  That was very helpful.

I learned that Texas Nissan of Grapevine is under new ownership and they seem to really care about their customers and seem be building a great dealership from the ground up.  I met most of their managers as it is customary for their managers to come meet their customers.  I met Chris Tatum, Johnny Utah, and even the new owner Johnny Cantrel.  

Thank you all for a great experience...I will definitly refer my friends and family to your facility.
