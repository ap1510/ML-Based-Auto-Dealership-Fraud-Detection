0,"April 23, 2020","This is the absolute WORST dealership I have been to, (and trust me I’ve been to Charlie Clark). However Bert Ogden Nissan in McAllen does not know how to treat its customers. I went in looking to purchase a brand new Titan for myself, after driving an hour to get there the reception said the sales man would be ready for me. After a while of waiting he shows up not even introducing himself, I really thought he was just some random guy and didn’t really put any effort into the sale. After calculating a few numbers for around 20 minutes AND CHECKING MY CREDIT he said he couldn’t do better but that he’d try tomorrow and call us back. He never did. So I CALLED THEM BACK. The lady then transfers me to ANOTHER sales man who promises to put his 100% into getting us a solution and call us back within a couple of hours. He never did. Long story short I went to Luke Fruia in Brownsville and got my self a new GMC Sierra instead. Best service and best thing I’ve done in my life. I guess things do happen for a reason.",1.0

I sent this complaint again Hector Megias 5 days ago to Mr. Nelson Garcia and Paula Regalado. I have not got any feedback so far or confirmation that they are dealing with the case. 
From my own experience, I think that this company and the dealer in my complaint should definitely be avoided. With my complaint, I want to take further steps, including towards the BBB and other possible forum.",1.0

4,"November 24, 2018","Went there to look at a vehicle listed/described on their internet site; upon arrival, I was told that said vehicle was in an Edinburg shop getting 'detailed', then I was shown other comparable vehicles but with a higher price.  I gave them my name and cell number and asked them to call me when the vehicle was returned to their lot; meantime the sales manager appeared with an offer to sell me the replacement vehicle; the offer was lopsided on their favor, I don't mind them making a profit but the figures were ridiculous.  Never buying anything from anything 'Bert Ogden'.",1.6
5,"May 11, 2018","I set up our first appointment for the service of our car. It was easy and they knew who we were right away. They took the car in on time and it was ready within an hour, for an oil change and tire rotation. Word of advise....schedule an appointment and Tuesdays and Wednesdays(they are slower). ",5.0
6,"April 03, 2018","On March 8th a new battery was replaced on my car because it was defected.  March 30th I was charged $ 34.50 for a diagnostic.  They determined it was only the positive terminal that was broken and replaced it, but I'm still having trouble with my car starting. I'm not a mechanic, but have had similar problems with my Mazda 3 and it was my alternator causing problems to the battery.  Michael and Mary from Service Dept. gave me excellent customer service, it just the service on my car that was bad. I'm having to carry cables to jump start my car. I called yesterday, 04/02/18 to the dealer and was transferred to Service Dept., but no one answered. I will try again today. ",3.0
7,"March 08, 2018","Worst place to buy a vehicle. DO NOT GO HERE. They are rude and snobby. They tell you to sign papers, but they don’t tell you what you’re signing. You have to ask what you’re signing. They also tell you they’re running your credit through one bank, but they run it through multiple banks without letting you know. We went there for a specific car, but they kept trying to get us to buy a newer one even though we told them we didn’t want that one. They kept insisting and told us to look at the car at least before we made up our minds. So we agreed to at least give it a look. We waited and waited, but they NEVER showed us the car they were trying to get us to purchase. After waiting for two hours, we decided to leave. The manager caught us leaving, and asked us if we were no longer interested. We told him no that we originally wanted the other one. As my husband was telling him we were interested in the other vehicle, he made an ugly face at us, pulled out out his phone and walked away mid sentence.",1.0

Jose Cansdales then worked with us throughout the process and is an outstanding professional.

13,"March 14, 2016","The service provided was very fast and friendly. Jose Cantu approached us and showed us vehicles within the price range we asked for without trying to get us to go up on price. He also mentioned that he didn't want to give us false information when we asked a question he didn't have an answer to, which helped us feel at ease that he wasn't just trying to sell just any car to us. He was very nice and well mannered. Cole Denckla also helped us out with financing in a big way, the stress and hassle of buying a car was gone when working with Bert Ogden Nissan.",5.0

15,"October 29, 2015","Approached a sales man to help look at the vehicles. Was told lie after lie. We asked to see a base model of the Versa. Walked around and the salesman did not show us what we asked for. We were shown higher end Versas but was told they had been on the lot for a long time, and they would honor a discount. Manager greated us and he was the most disrespectful person I ever experienced at a car dealership. When I asked about the discount he looked at me and said who told you that. The salesman was right behind us and never spoke up. The manager was asking the same questions as the salesman and we told that guy to tell his mansger what we discussed. Again he stayed quiet. The manager was rude and would not answer specific questions from us. I will never return to this dealership. They lost a sale due to their lack of ability to make a car buying experience good. It was nothing short of asking us to leave. So we did. ",1.0

19,"June 29, 2015","I recently tried to purchase a used Nissan altima. I went to Bert Ogden Nissan on Jackson . There was a salesperson by the name of Jaime pulido that I spoke to. I told him that I have always purchased from Altima, maxima, Sentra. Only one time from Bert Ogden. Bert Ogden always asks for money even with my trade in. I have to eventually have to go elsewhere where they don't ask for additional money down. I have tried to give Bert Ogden on many times. They do not try to help you at all. I have 6 sisters and they all used to drive nissans and have all traded in their vechiles and have bought a vechiles elsewhere. They all left for this same reason and won't go back",1.0

He adviced me on the new 2015 Pathfinder and showed me all the features of this new model. He was very patient and answered every single question that I had. On the other hand, Mr. Santiago Balderas guided me step by step through out the finance process on this purchase. All I can say is that your employees were extremely friendly and helpful. I really had a great time buying my car  in your company and would highly recommend this place. ",5.0

24,"November 12, 2014","""Worst customer service experience ever""
   On Saturday November 1st, my mother in-law decided to finally go and buy her first vehicle out of a car dealer, she has two running vehicles already but she wanted to try the ""dealer certified"" vehicle and possibly sell one of her current ones. She decided to go to Bert Ogden Nissan in McAllen, TX and I went along with her to help her out on her search.

   When I arrived she had already been shown a couple of vehicles and was going to be taken on a test drive, the used vehicles have no sale price on them, you have to ask how much the car is and the salesman (J Silva) throws a number at you , her budget was $15K so we told him we are looking for something under that and coincidentally the two or three vehicles that were shown to us were right under that price, again no sale price on the vehicles so you never know the real price/value of any of them.

    My mother in law finally made a choice and we were taken inside to start the application process and she was asked if there will be a down payment, she said she could put $1500 down towards that vehicle and they asked for a check right there and then , we kept telling the salesman , ""wait, how much is the car going to be? What interest rate are we looking at?"" he kept repeating ""Oh we will give you a good rate"" and kept asking how much could she pay per month, she has no credit history since she likes to pay all her purchases cash. We established her monthly car payment couldn't exceed $300.00 and I kept insisting that her interest will need to be under 5% to make that deal. 

      He came back with some number for price of the vehicle , taxes and some ""obligatory"" insurance for the paint and the interior of the car, I told him that there was no way that she will purchase those extra insurance (about $1850 of that) and kept saying ""oh you have to, there's no way we can remove it, blah, blah, blah"" , he went back and forth with his manager and finally returned saying ""OK you don't have to take the insurance""  and he said since she had no credit history that she couldn't get tat 5% interest rate we were looking, we tried including me in the credit check as a co-signer but since I had recently had purchased another vehicle that wouldn't help, so we told him that we would maybe consider taking the car if the interest rate was under 10% and looking at all numbers, he asked if she could give more of a down payment to help the deal , she agreed to give $2000.00 down, he went back to his finance office and finally came back saying ""Congratulations we got a great interest rate, you are going to be happy, let's get that check for the $2000.00""

     During all this time she signed some papers giving consent for them to run her credit and such but no paper was signed agreeing to the purchase of the vehicle, specially since we haven't seen the final price for it. She didn't have a check with her so the salesman offered to drive her to the bank, being a Saturday she was only able to take out $800.00 cash from the bank, while they drove to the bank I went to grab something to eat for my 10 year old that was with us and we had been there for a couple of hrs, so by the time I comeback the salesman says ""your mother in law went to her house to get the other $1200"" , I didn't know she had already given the $800.00 to him , I took the opportunity to take my daughter home since we still have to do all the paperwork with the finance and look at the final numbers.

      When we came back we were finally taken to the finance office and then they showed us the numbers, the interest rate was 13% and would generate about $7500 in interest so final price of the vehicle with taxes, licence and interest rate was now at somewhere around $22000,00!!! We immediately said no, we are not purchasing the vehicle, the finance employee then started what it would be from there on a non stop chain of rudeness and demeaning comments from all the employees, he said ""We got you the payment you wanted , $300.00 and off course with her credit well that's why the interest rate is so high"" , we told him we were not taking the vehicle and that we wanted her $800.00 back , he directed us to the salesman, I asked the salesman for her money and off course the salesman said ""well why are you not taking the car? We got you the payment you wanted, $300"" , we told him we just wanted her money back and he said ""Well we can't give it to you, it's already been deposited and no one can get it back until the owner of all 16 dealerships comes and signs a check for it"" , I told him we just had given him the $800.00 cash and that she needed her money back, at that point he makes the comment ""why do you need it is just $800.00""  as if that was any sort of pocket cash of it wasn't important at all.
    
    At this point the manager for the used cars came out of his office (Cole Denckla) and it was like replay of what the salesman said ""Why are you not taking the car , blah, blah, blah""  he took me into an office where he tried to convince me to make a deal no matter what ""what if we give you a 0% interest rate ?"" ....In my head I'm thinking ""you could have given her that interest from the start and you choose not to"", I told him we just needed her money and again it was the story of ""the money has been deposited and now only the owner can sign a check for it in around a couple of weeks when he shows up to the dealer "", I wasn't allowed to speak with the general manager even tough I asked for him and by this this time it was past 8 PM we just went home with the feeling that we have been hustled, lied to and robbed. They did provide a receipt for the money. 

    On Monday I called general manager John Barraza a couple of times, needless to say I wasn't able to talk to him but he did returned my call, I explained him the situation and then the call got lost and when I tried to call him back again he wasn't available no more, I went after work to the dealer and look for him, he wasn't available and new car director Henry Reyna was the one that took the time to talk to me, I explained him the whole fiasco and he was very educated (unlike the previous employees) and apologetic , he said he will try to put a rush into that check and he provided his card with cell phone number, he asked if there's any way they could make it up to my mother in law as far as the customer service experience is related to and offered a good deal on a brand new vehicle for her, unfortunately at that point the damage was too much and she didn't want nothing to do with them and I don't blame her. It took a whole week and days to get her check issued to her but she did got her money back.

     This is the worst costumer service ever that I have ever experienced for myself and let alone for someone as loved as my mother in law, I feel tremendously responsible that I allowed them to take advantage of her by taking her money and holding it even when there was no deal or contract signed for them to deposit that money into their accounts. I will never recommend this not even to my worst enemy and I have come to find out that we are not the only ones that have been treated with rudeness, disrespect and dishonesty by this dealership and their employees and managing team when my wife started showing me all the reviews for this dealer. 
     
    Final words , No matter what it is, shoes, clothing, food, a pencil or a car; You may what you have purchased, where you bought it or how much you payed for it but you will never forget how they made you feel...

25,"September 22, 2014","No dealership in the valley has a staff as professional as Bert Ogden Nissan. Mr. John Barraza is absolutely fabulous, knows his stuff. I recommend  this dealership to anyone that is looking for the best deal in south Texas",5.0
26,"August 14, 2014","Bert Ogden Nissan Used Cars in McAllen is the worst dealership to purchase a vehicle. They don't sell the vehicle as priced and add warranties saying they are obligatory. Not to mention the receptionist wants to know every detail of why you are calling, can't she just transfer the call to the department she is being told to transfer. I strongly do not recommend Bert Ogden, I regret buying my vehicle from them. I bought my vehicle on July 14 at 11:00 pm as a new buyer with zero credit it took long to have a bank finance me (as per what the sales man said). A week passed and I had not reviewed anything regarding the vehicle since a family member was in ICU and I was spending the night at the hospital. Reviewing papers did not even cross my mind. So after a week I review my paper work and I see different numbers that don't match so I call my bank and find out the warranties I was told were obligatory are actually optional. As a first time buyer I freaked and of course felt more confused not knowing what to do. The bank told me that my vehicle was sold to me at $17, 300 with an 18% interest rate. That same day I went to Bert Ogden Nissan in McAllen to have everything explained to me and I asked for copies of my file. The manager just had me going back and fourth with his lies but I had the bank on the phone listening to everything and when I requested copies he said to not have any since they send everything out; they don't keep the file at the dealership. I told them the price of the vehicle was originally $18, 999 with a Nissan rebate of $4,000 so the final price was $14, 999 and the sales man told me the vehicle would come out to about 16 thousand something including all fees. They sold me the vehicle at $17, 300, with taxes and fees totaled to $20, 799.38 saying the bank raised the price in order to finance me and that I had to give a big down payment so I gave $4,000 down leaving my balance due at $16, 799.38. But when I had called the bank they told me that they don't raise the price they only negotiate the interest rate. I gave the manager the keys saying I didn't want my car anymore and of course they refused to take it back and give me my down payment. He said that would affect my credit. Since I saw they weren't helping the next day I called one of the warranties and luckily they refunded the whole amount. Although, with the other warranty I have been having trouble to cancel it because it has to be canceled directly with Bert Ogden and of course they are not moving a finger to reimburse me my money which is a total of $1, 895. I hope they fix this problem and redo my contract to the price they had told me without the warranties or else just give me my money back and I will give them the car.Be very careful with this place you really do not want to go through everything I am going through especially right now with my family member still in ICU, working full time and this mess. My first time purchasing a car and I get ripped off, seriously not cool. I just spoke to Santiago the finance manager in the used car department and he denied telling me the protection package is obligatory. He said that he never told me it was obligatory he said it is an optional package. (If it's an optional package why did he add it after I said I didn't want it and why did the manager Armando say it's obligatory the second time I went in) Santiago even blamed my sales person Mike and a manager named Colt saying they told me the package is obligatory and that they changed my price to $17, 300. I have never spoke with a manager named Colt and Mike never ever negotiated the protection package with me. Mike had even told me that day he doesn't work numbers. I recommend you all to record everything they tell you from the moment you speak to a sales person until you make the purchase of the vehicle and take home the contract to review everything before signing. Because once you sign they will give you the run around like the Used car director Oscar Garza did to me. I went into the dealership personally and all he said is that they can't fix anything and that my acquisitions of calling his employee Santiago a liar are strong and that if i plan to get an attorney I won't beat them. I had never even mentioned getting an attorney, I guess they have ripped people off before that they already now the procedure. When I was in the office with Oscar Garza, Santiago passed by and I asked to speak with him. Oscar then got up walked out for about 1 minute and said Santiago was with a client and the there was nothing else to do so he just left me in the office. I waited for about 3 minutes nobody came so I got up to leave and I saw the manager Armando, the director Oscar Garza and another manager telling Santiago what to tell me in case i spoke with him. There is no cameras in the offices were you sign the contract so i suggest for you to record everything and review EVERYTHING before you sign.",1.0
27,"August 02, 2014",The moment I walked in to the show room I was greeted with a friendly smile by everyone they wanted to assist in my buying experience. I had a great salesperson and General manager that assisted! The Finance advisor was very efficient as well. I've recommended friends to the dealership and they were happy buying customers too. The professional attire of all employees is a benefit. It speaks volumes of the expectation from dealership & management. ,5.0
28,"July 20, 2014","Service is horrible.  It took 7 hours to service my vehicle.  I called after 3 hours to check on the status of my car and everyone working on my car  was out to lunch.  I told them to call me when my car was ready.  It was close to 4:00 p.m. and no call from the dealership.  I called them again to check on the status...my car was ready.  Why did they not call me when I specifically told them to call me...by the way the invoice was stamped 3:24 p.m.  This is not an isolated incident. This has happened to me before. 
I do not recommend their service department unless you have all day to wait.",2.8
29,"May 12, 2014","I went in my family and I had to go in by myself the next day bc the bank had not responded yet, not once did they give me proper info and kept beating around the bush, I never even got my interest rate and my salesman was already asking me to hand over my card for a down payment. I said no bc I needed more info, he then called his floor manager, Roel. Roel was so disrespectful, condescending,  rude, arrogant and threatening. He was very unprofessional and he easily convinced me I would never want to do business at a company with employees like that.   I've never been treating in such a way. He stated if I didn't sign this deal I would not get approved at any other dealership and that if I walked out and called my family to discuss the little info i had about the current deal he would not wait and just call the bank and cancel everything. I quickly told him I would not be purchasing my new car there and stormed off, devasted, crying and in shock with the treatment I received from someone who had just shook my hand moments before when I arrived. Management called me a few hours later to apologize and offered me a different deal, which I appreciated.  However it was too late, the damage was done. I would never go back there again. I never should have been treated that way as a serious customer buying her first new vehicle. I'm sure if I wasn't a female or if my family was there things would have been different. I felt 100% attacked.  It Was An Experience I Wish I Could forget. I DO NOT recommended going to this dealership at all. Youll be treated nicely at first but if you have questions or concerns they will treat you like dirt and all they care about is the sale. Worst experience I've ever had. And to this day the ""floor manager"" of course was not man enough or professional enough to ever apologize for what he put me through.  Go anywhere else but here to purchase a vehicle. ",1.0

Jose Gomez was honest which is hard to find in the car biz. We sat down took 5 min to get to an agreeable price.
We were in and out under an hour. Jose went over everything I needed to know, he wasn't rushed like on other lots to try and get a new customer. If any one reading this is thinking about a nissan and your in the RGV area talk to Jose red carpet treatment all the way.",5.0

I always made sure he was the one taking care of me and my vehicle. he explains everything to where I can understand and always does it with a smile. I am also a business owner and know how hard it is to find good people that go above and beyond. I wanted to reach out and let you know that you have a good employee. He delivers great customer service I can tell he enjoys his work, and I always feel I'm in good hands. I wish I had more employees like the one you have. I feel he deserve honorable mention and can be a roll model that can help train other service personal on what it takes to deliver exceptional customer service.

33,"June 17, 2013","This is by far the worst dealership I have ever dealt with. I went to get a simple oil change 2 days later my brakes start messing up. The dealership blames it on my electrical components of the car I added afterwards. When my car worked perfectly fine for 6 months. What a coincidence that it started messing up 2 days after I got my oil change. I had to pay $100 for something that should have been covered under warranty. But just so they could charge me they blamed it on something that has nothing to do with the brakes. 

Do NOT ever go here for service. These guys are robbers. 
Do NOT ever buy a car from them. They will not even honor their newspaper advertisement price. ",1.0

He was very respectful and made my wife and I feel comfortable while visiting the dealership.  We usually buy our vehicles in San Antonio because of price and selection, but found that Bert Odgen Nissan has a great selection of quality cars and were great to work with to get the deal done.  I drove off the lot with the car on the same day and even decided to buy the extended warranty which I had not anticipated doing.   Very good experience and I will definately shop there again.

36,"April 14, 2013","Our experience at Bert Ogden Nissan was exceptional.  Erick Gomez met us at our car with an attitude of respectful, caring service.  Being ""young"" senior citizens (65), Erick was extremely patient and attentive.  Every car we showed interest in, Erick would bring it around for us to drive.  We probably drove 10 cars.  He would quietly sit in the back seat, answer our questions and teach us how to use the technology on each car.  Erick never rushed or pressured us, which we really appreciated.  He always seemed to be sincerely enjoying his job which made it a very pleasant and positive experience for us.  Erick was polished and professional.  We dedided to buy one car.  

Then we had the pleasure of meeting Robert Dupoy in Finance.  Another great experience.... Robert was superbly organized.  He explained all the forms and made the tedious job of paperwork actually seeem like a bit of fun.  He has a wonderful sense of humor and wit and smiled through the entire tedious process.  It was fun watching him go through the mountain of paperwork, dealing with the technologhy(computer, printer, fax, shredder), rolling his chair from forms to different equipment....somewhat like watching a dance.... He was charming.

As we waited for our car to be ready for our possession, we decided to go ahead and buy a second car.  We notified Erick and started the process again.  We were at the dealership for the entire day (9:30-6:00), but the day went quickly as we waited in the very well appointed and comfortable waiting area.

44,"August 11, 2012","Bought a nissan altima back in 2010 with a contract agreement of an extended warranty of 125,000.  In 2011 I found out my extended warranty was only for 72,000 miles. I was very upset and spoke to the manager in bert ogden nissan, which tried to say it was a mistake by the sales person to have offered and did not want to honor the extended warranty. After alot of argueing and stress, the manager acted as if he was doing me a favor and offered a 105,000 extended warranty. Frustrated and disgusted with dealing with professional con artist I agreed to it. While I was getting an oil change which by the way took 3 hrs, august 2012, I found out that the manger never changed the extended warranty and it was back to 72,000 miles. After completing having a melt down of being lyed to again. I go into the nissan to speak with someone about this. This was on a tuesday I spoke to someone in fiance and he said he would take care of this right away to give him till wednesday.

47,"April 22, 2012","I recently purchased my second new Nissan from Richard Acevedo III.  I am very impressed with Mr. Acevedo because he is a very upbeat and courteous individual.  He always tries his best to understand what the customer is looking for and makes shopping for a car an easy and enjoyable event.  He stays with a customer all during the sales process, the financial process, during the delivery of the automobile.  His positive attitude is contagious and this makes the customer feel great.  There is nothing negative about this young man, and I can honestly say that if I am ever in the market for another car someday, I hope he is still at this dealership.

The lady tha handled my financing I believe was Mrs. Flores and she is also to be commended for doing a great job.  Despite the fact that it was late, she was very patient and made sure everything was finished before I walked away.

49,"April 13, 2012","So glad I can tell you about the success I had buying a car from Bert Ogden Nissan last year.  I probably wrote a separate review last year but my Nissan has been a better car than I ever hoped I could have.
I had driven my previous car close to 100,000 miles and was due a new car.  I looked at the Cruise and since my other car was a Malibu, I was ready to buy.  It was my husband who said, Let's look at the Nissan.
My Nissan is economical, as well as beautiful.  It was if I had requested blue tooth, which I didn't; garage door opener, which I didn't; and back up view screen, which I didn't know existed.
Through the months I have appreciated my Nissan more and more.
Not only did Bert Ogden have a great selection but I also like the American Heart which sits on my back windshield.
I LOVE MY NISSAN!
I will buy my next car from Bert Ogden again.  John Barraza and Frank Gutierrez were so professional and helpful and helped me set up the blue tooth and work the screen.",5.0
50,"April 10, 2012","My husband and I had our previous vehicle for only 7 months. We then decided that the vehicle that we had purchased was not a vehicle that met the needs of our family. After speaking with different dealerships, we discovered that it was going to be difficult to trade in since we were upside down on our current vehicle. Frustated and tired, we pretty much gave up hope. Well, that was up until we met and spoke with rep. Robert Putty. My husband was there from morning up till late in the evening while I was at work. My husband knew the vehicles that I liked and disliked, so that made it pretty easier for him. By the time I knew it, Mr. Putty was right in my office with my husband for us both to sign all necessary documents for our purchase on our new vehicle. I was shocked and asked my husband is this for real, are you sure? My husband then stated, just sign do not worry everything has already been discussed. We both happily sign and we do not regret our purchase. He also stated to me when we are ready to trade in this vehicle that he is going back to Bert Ogden in the future!

51,"March 13, 2012","My experience with Bert Ogden Mcallen Motors, INC.

The thought of purchasing a new vehicle is a horrendous thought alone, especially, in this economy. The last thing you need is for a car salesman to pressure you, which is the case in most car dealerships, but not at Bert Ogden. My partner and I had set our minds before hand that we would just walk in and LOOK around (key word LOOK). Well, we did look for about twenty minutes when we were introduced to Adriana Salinas, sales representative. The confidence in her shined from head to toe and it assured us that she was knowledgeable about her work. After the test drive she walked us into a cubicle were we started our negotiation. She took everything into consideration and respected us as human beings, which is rare here in the valley. I will not go into further detail, but I will state that the negotiation was intense on both parts (ours and the dealership's). Once we were done with the negotiation she accompanied us to the finance department were we met with Martha Silva Flores. Martha was busy with another client so we were asked to wait in the lobby for a short period of time. As we nervously waited, Mike Castillo presented himself with a bear hugging attitude that quickly calmed us down. He went over some features of the car as well as the different qualities and services they offer. That are awesome, if I may say so myself. As he departed, Martha welcomed us into her office. Her positive energy of optimism and her insight to life is one I wish she could share with the rest of the world. She explained everything to the smallest detail and when we were done it felt like I had just received an accountant certificate. I will not say that my experience was perfect (because no one is perfect), but they were pretty damn near it. I now ride in a comfortable car, thanks to them.

58,"October 08, 2011","I was in the market for a new car and decided to give Bert Ogden Nissan McAllen a try because I was so impressed with their prompt response to phone and internet inquiries. I guess I should have just left it at that. I was lied to and lured to the dealership by a salesperson who said my car was ready for me to pick up. He assured me my deal was backed by Mr. Vacker himself. Not even knowing who that was I went on the word of Chris and went to pick up my car. It was great up until the point when he drove me to a dark parking lot in back of the store to try to get me to take a cheaper car because the car that was nice, washed, and shiny up front, could not be sold to me because they were taking too big a loss. This is where it gets interesting. He told my husband he should have taken the deal the day before. He compared it to getting drunk, where you don't know what really happened and no finds out. We missed our opportunity  and hence no deal. Be careful! I should have listened to a former employee who warned me of this practice of luring you in with promises too good to be true, only to waste your time and humiliate you. Why don't the managers do anything about this and this Mr. Vacker person. So beware of the deal that is too good to be true because it probably is and then they will get you there, bully you, pretend to be your best friend, send three or four people to talk to you, and get you to give up and take the crappy deal, oh and then laugh at you when your close to tears.

67,"May 15, 2011","Our experience at Bert Ogden Nissen was initially a mixture of some frustration and questioning.  However, it was due to our expectations not meeting the expectations of the management at the dealership. Had it not been for Red (Raymond McGarity) our sales representative we might have gone elsewhere.  We first met him in late March during Sprint break while looking for a car. He was professional, genuine and was not at all pushy. He let us think things through and agreed to be available should we decide to purchase a car.  We were looking at Nissen Sentras at the time, but were not ready to make a commitment to a purchase.  After going to several other dealerships, we decided to return to Bert Ogden in May when our son came home from school.  We went to Bert Ogden Nissen and specifically asked for Red because of the positive impression he made on the first visit.  We ended up buying a Nissen Altima.
I would definitely go back to purchase another car from this dealership and specifically from Red becuse of the good service he provided.  In fact, we have already talked to our sister about purchasing a car from this dealership.

Red exemplifies what my dad used to call ""true customer service"". He is not out to just make a living for himself and the company, he is an example of someone who knows how to treat the customer in a manner which is genuine.  It is readily apparent that he truely enjoys and believes in what he does and most importantly takes pride in his work.

68,"April 28, 2011","We had actually decided on a vehicle at another dealership but my husband decided to stop by Bert Ogden one evening.  He came back home so excited about the price of a Nissan Rogue which was a much better price than the vehicle we had set our eyes on.  I wasn't a believer until I went the next day to see for myself.  For a very small difference I would purchase a brand new vehicle instead of a 2008 model I had seen at Hacienda Ford.  How can that be??  Well, it's true!!!  Rich, our salesman, was very easy going, no pressure, and absolutely great.  He knew exactly what we wanted and didn't push us into another type or style of car.  It really is a big relief that he listened to our needs in regards to space and safety features we wanted in a vehicle.  I drove off in my red Nissan Rogue with a big smile knowing I had purchased the right vehicle.  

We had to take our 1 yr old daughter which was tough because the wait time for all the paper work to be ready is long as expected.  Unfortunately, Bert Ogden doesn't cater to those of us shopping with little ones.  I really wish there was a baby changing station so I didn't have to change my dauther's diaper on a chair with no privacy and there was no kids room or at least a TV.

70,"February 21, 2011","First I have to say I am so glad I never purchased a vehicle from this stealership. 

I went in looking to buy an Altima. Noticed they had a few 2009 models still on the lot selling as brand new. It being 2010 I figured I could get a good deal on last year's model. For some reason they thought that 2009's should cost the same as the 2010's. Under what logic? I'm not someone who needs to be ""sold"" a car. I do my research and I know what I'm going looking for before getting to the dealer. Most of the guys at this dealer think they are so slick and have this attitude that just makes me nauseous. Anyway, I was approached by some guy who looked as if he could have been some homeless dude off the street they gave a shot at selling cars to. I still wasn't convinced he was really even a salesman until he started in with the paperwork. 

He kept pulling this little trick sales people will use known as ""conditioning"" Keeps writing things by hand on a piece of paper and saying will you buy this car if I give you the right price. After you sign enough times you don't even notice you are signing loan papers at the end. I started running out of fake names to sign because he asked me to do this so much. He wouldn't go to the next step unless I wrote something down and I wasn't serious about jumping into a loan when he wouldn't even give me the price of the car. At some point he asked for my debit card and I gave it to him. I think they were doing something to see how much money I had in my account. Crooked jerks. Turns out they were holding my card ransom for signed loan papers. they wouldn't give me my card back until I gave the papers back to them signed. They must pay off the police because when I threatened to call them they just told me go ahead they would call them too. 

Bottom line is this place is the biggest waste of time unless you are a complete idiot or desperate for a Nissan. I ended up buying a used altima from Frank Smith and I had a very good experience there. They got me in and out with a loan of the percentage I asked for. I will never ever ever ever go to Bert Ogden Nissan again. This place made me so mad I won't even buy from one of their other dealers.

Jacob our sales person was the best, not once pressuring us to buy, even offering us to continue searching until we felt comfortable.  After negotiating our deal, we decided to purchase our vehicle here.  This is where the drama begins, the finance department.  My negotiated $15,000 car would now cost me $29,800.  Life insurance, disability insurance (both of which I have with my employer), service protection (which was touted as free oil changes), equipment protection, & gap insurance were tagged unto the vehicle price. The final price of all these additional charges, $7,500.  When asked if I could have a copy of my paper work I was told that it would be mailed to me, conveniently after they have received the funds from my lending institution. When I did receive the paperwork I tried calling the finance department to inquiry on all of these additional charges.  Good luck getting someone to answer the company phone 956-631-6666.  Whenever I did reach someone I was told that they would have someone call me back.  
Thank God, after reviewing all the insurance papers it looks as though I may be able to recover all of these cost & all I will be out is time spent, and about 6 months higher interest rates until I can refinance the new lower price of the vehicle.

75,"August 30, 2010","My wife and I went twice to Bert Ogden Nissan in McAllen, TX to buy a Sentra. On our first visit the salesman did a very good job showing us the car, and we were impressed with the vehicle. We returned the next day to learn about the price, incentives, and financing available. At other dealerships this procedure is always pretty much similar by providing our information, and then the price is given with any discounts and incentives, and with financing terms that we qualify for.

Well, this is where things went crazy. The sales staff would not provide any numbers unless we would agree to buy right that instant. We asked for the final price with taxes and financing options twice. The General Sales Manager came out to talk with us. He wanted to know why we were being difficult and would not just buy the car. He said that we just wanted to compare prices, as if this is some kind of crime. We were stunned that this kind of insulting aggressive technique was actually being used on us. We left the lot, and as we drove down the street the manager called me on my cell phone to give me his ""price"", I replied we would think about it.

I don't honestly understand how they sell so many vehicles this way, except by praying on the uninformed or naive customer.  We have spoken to family and friends about this, and many have indicated similiar treatment. Bottom line is we left with no information at all on the price or finance rates. These guys are to be avoided. Save your time and energy. Beware their predatory practices.

78,"August 08, 2010","We were shopping for two vehicles. Ulysses came out to aid us immediately and stayed with us throughout the day to make sure we were taken care of by all of the other service people who crossed our path. Ulysses was informative, kind and attentive. Later we dealt with Miguel Castillo who set us up with a comprehensive protection plan. Mr. Castillo was thorough and patient with his explanations of the three protection plans. We were extremely satisfied with our treatment and our purchases at Bert Ogden Nissan. Our special thanks again go out to Ulysses and Miguel.",5.0

80,"August 06, 2010","I dealt with another Rio Grande Valley dealer and literally was disrespected.
Bert Ogden was really professional, courteous, and respectful. Not to mention they had the exact vehicle.  I will certainly be purchasing my next vehicle from the Ogden family of car dealership.",5.0
81,"August 05, 2010",This is the first car for our 16 yr. old daughter. We were concerned about safety and performance in a car.  The people at Bert Ogden Nissan in McAllen were very polite.  They took their time in explaining all the details about the car. They went into full detail about the warranty and extra coverage we could purchase.  We felt very comfortable about the price we met on and about the financing we were offered.  We very very pleased and are now looking into buying a nissan maxima with them.   ,5.0
82,"August 01, 2010","Let me tell you that my experience with Bert Ogden was fantastic. They were extremely friendly and helpful and, most of all, PATIENT. They answered all our questions and made sure we got into a 2010 Nissan Sentra and even helped us with financing. Being this my first experience with a new car dealer, I think I couldn't have done better with anyone else! Thank you so much Bert Ogden, you rock!!!!",5.0

85,"May 29, 2010",Bert ogden nissan mcallen has the worst customer service.  they need to get qualified management with a college degree in business.  they have the least regard for customers and they really don't care if they loose a sale.  thomas ochoa is rude and has no manners. i will never buy from bert ogden nissan.,1.0
86,"April 28, 2010",I live in Brownsville and made the mistake of buying my nissan sentra at charlie clark. After I bought it I started having problems with the gas tank and took it in for service. They tried fixing my problem 3 times but were useless. I got so frustrated that I decided to drive to Mcallen and take it to Bert Ogden. A guy named Mario explained to me what the clark dealer was doing and why the problem was still there. He was extremely professional and polite. After I explained where I live they worked with me and fixed my gas tank! I am extremely thankful that my car is back to tip top shape. Never servicing my car at clark again.,5.0
87,"April 01, 2010","This has to be the most poorly run service department I have ever worked with in my life. We're currently waiting at day 5 for what should be a simple problem, hesitation and stalling with a service engine soon light on.

Forget about calling them. They either won't answer the phone or will lie to you about when they're going to give you a call back. I called at different times on different days and nobody would answer the phone. All I wanted to know was if they had diagnosed the problem and approximately when the car would be available again. 

If I ever get the car back, I'll update again on how the actual repair went.

89,"September 16, 2009","NISSAN CARS SEEM NOT TO BE WORTH THE PRICE, WELL AT LEAST THE ALTIMA. WE HEARD OF A PROMOTION THEY WERE HAVING THAT WAS ADVERTISED ON THE RADIO. TURNS OUT THE ALTIMA THAT WAS AT AN UNBEATABLE PRICE CAME WITHOUT A RADIO. IF WE WANTED  RADIO, WE WERE EXPECTED TO PAY ABOUT 3500 MORE. NOT TO MENTION, IT IS REQUIRED TO ADD ABOUT $1500 TO THE AMOUNT YOU ARE FINANCING BECAUSE OF SOME PACKAGE THEY DEEM AS NECESSARY. AND YES I SAID REQUIRED. I THINK THATS A LOAD OF BULL. NOT SATISFIED WITH THIS DEALERSHIP, OR NISSAN IF THATS HOW ITS GOING TO BE. ",2.6

91,"July 17, 2009","I have been trying to get the gap insurance terminated. I called all day on Friday July 17, 2009 and NO ONE was working in the finance dept. The receptionist even said no one was working in there. My father signed the paperwork on June 15, 2009 and Bert Ogden has yet to send the papers to Austin. No one in finance will return calls and the dealership here in Houston where we bought a new car had to do the initial paperwork as NO ONE at bert Ogden seemed to know what to do. My 80 year old father made 2 trips to sign the paperwork because of incompetence and my dad was friends with Bert when he was alive. I am so disappointed in the company so disappointed.

I had purchased two cars from them before and was very happy however this incident just upset me so much. Hopefully they will fix this situation.",3.0
92,"March 09, 2009",be very wary of deals made here.  make sure all information is in writing.  maybe have them copy things as you agree to them  as no verbal deals are honored here no matter who makes them.  check out better business bureau website for more information.  ,1.0
93,"August 27, 2007","Tomas Ochoa, a manager at this location, was rude and extremely unprofessional. After mentioning that I purchased two vehicles at that location, he replied that he did not need my service there and to be sure to spell his name correctly when I made contact with corporation. When I brought in a police officer to take a report of items not received that I had already been charged for, Tomas Ochoa stated that he could not wait to go to court then stated to other empolyees, ""They can't touch me"" and snickered. When I submitted my customer service survey, for which I was promised a gas fill-up, they asked me for my Spansh version of the survey. Tomas Ochoa finally made me realize why - he stated that the survey had to be a ""perfect"" survey in order to get teh tank of gas. I believe they intended to fill out the Spanish version and send that one in instead. Bad service, worst people.",1.6
