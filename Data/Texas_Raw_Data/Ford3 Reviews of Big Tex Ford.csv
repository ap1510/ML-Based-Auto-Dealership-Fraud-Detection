0,"April 26, 2010","Let's start with the buying process.  I was at this run-down dealership for almost 5 hours buying my truck.  Having sold cars for a couple of years I know this was waaaaaaay too long. My salesperson wasn't knowledgeable at all. When we couldn't come to terms on the truck I was on my way out, starting up my vehicle when they waived me back inside. Turns out the could make the deal I wanted.  I went through finance (also very unprofessional), signed all of my paperwork and about 2hrs later I was driving home.  About a week later I got a call from Will (sales manager) saying I would have to give them an additional $200 down and buy a warranty that would increase my payments by about $20 a month.  Having sold cars I know that my deal had been sitting in the finance office for a week trying to find a lender to purchase it at the terms we agreed on.  When they couldn't find one that wouldn't take some of their profit away to take the deal they called me to ""sweeten"" it for them so they could at least make some money on the back end in finance.  The sales ""manager"" Will was very confronational with me when I let him know I knew my rights and knew what was going on.  This dealership is a run-down piece of junk and their ""sales"" staff is a joke, their finance department is an un-organized  joke.  I wouldn't recommend giving this place your business unless you're ready to be jerked around and lied to.  This place is a joke.",2.2
1,"October 11, 2009","The sneakiest, most dishonest ""business"" people I've ever dealt with.  After finding a vehicle, agreeing on all the terms, and even having my financing in place, I went to drop off the paperwork proving my income and pick up the car. After arriving, the finance manager, Justin,  who told me they took loans from my bank, was not available, a different finance guy said they would not be able to let me have the vehicle I picked out without an EXTRA $3,900 FEE!! He offered to find me a different SUV, but I declined stating I would not do business with such dishonest people.  I've bought several cars & seen lots of dealer tricks, but THEY WERE THE MOST DISHONEST CAR DEALERSHIP I'VE EVER DEALT WITH.  ",1.0
2,"July 11, 2009","I went in on Wed, July 1st, 2009 to Big Tex Ford to look at a vehicle they advertised on their website. I had already filled out the credit application and received an approval.

When I got there, they claimed the only way I could get the vehicle I wanted was to use someone else's name. I did have a co-signer if necessary but they claimed it would have to be listed in their name only excluding me and they live out of state. This person agreed. I gave them a check for $1000 as a downpayment and left with the vehicle.

When the person who was going to sign for the vehicle received the paperwork, there were multiple, fraudulent statements listed including but not limited to: time of employment and income. The contract clearly states that signing this information, if it is incorrect, is punishable as a class 3 felony. The person, of course, refused to sign the documents. I questioned Justin Sage about this incorrect information listed and he claimed he knew nothing about it even though he is the gentleman that I sat with and is also the business manager. Makes me wonder what kind of business they are conducting.

On Thurs, July 9th, I drove the vehicle back to Big Tex Ford as Justin told me there would be no problem refunding my downpayment when he had a chance to look the vehicle over. I was then told by Will, the Sales Manager (I think) that a check would be ready in 24 hours and I could come and pick it up. I had to request something in writing to guarantee I would receive a refund. The next day I called Justin to make sure the check was ready and he claimed they could not issue the check until they received the paperwork back.

Today is Sat, July, 11th and I have contacted Big Tex Ford yet again to inquire about my refund. Now Will is telling me that it takes 10 business days before a refund can be issued because my check has to ""clear"". My check was withdrawn from my account on July 7th. He had already told me that the check had cleared through their accounting department at this point. 

Now I am sitting with, what seems to be no recourse against a large company, with no property and no refund. Justin Sage and Will have done nothing but give me the run around with this deal and I would recommend no one use Big Tex Ford for any automotive needs whatsoever! They tried to get a deal done no matter who they put at risk as long as they weren't doing anything ""illegal"".
