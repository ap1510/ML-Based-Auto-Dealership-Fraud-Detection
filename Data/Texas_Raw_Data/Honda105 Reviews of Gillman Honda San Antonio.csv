2,"October 19, 2019","Purchased a 2004 honda civic with low miles.  Great price,but have spent more on repairs than the cost of the car. I understand the age. But to spend thousands and the maintenance light comes on within a month of each visit!!! Then I called james who at best  was short with me- told me he has numerous hondas in everyday and told me my car needed an oil change,  which I did.
Still a maintenance light on. To GED up to call back again. ",2.0
3,"October 06, 2019","On Aug 30 2019 my wifes 2016 Acura MDX with 44,300 miles check engine light came on and car had no power. She had it towed to Gillman Honda. They checked it out and told her that they had to order a part and would take 4 days to get that part in. Turns out to be rocker arm oil pressure switch went bad (part # HON 37240-R70-A04 and O Ring part # HON 91319-PAA-A01). They charged her $7.56 for the rubber O-ring and $55.37 for the oil pressure switch. I wonder where they get their parts since the OEM oil pressure switch can be purchased for between $26. and $28. most anywhere online. The part that really gets me is what they charged for labor to replace the oil sensor, $300. This is taking advantage of the customer who is unaware. This oil sensor replacement should take no more than 30 minutes to replace. Total bill $62.93 parts , Shop supplies & admin fees $32.70, Lab-mechanical $300.00, Sub Total $395.63, tax $7.89 which totals $403.52. ",2.2
4,"September 28, 2019",I want to thank Jorge Amparan for his outstanding and excellent service at Gillman Honda of San Antonio .He went above and beyond to find me the best deal on my Honda Accord.He is one of the best salesman there  and I highly recommend him to anyone. Thank you so much.,5.0
5,"August 21, 2019","I purchased a vehicle in May, much to my surprised there where hidden charges that I didn't agree to added to my contract.  WATCH OUT learn from my mistake.   Grab a calculator,  add the price of your vehicle  + sales tax+ License and all reg fees+ any other option you purchased=   If this doesn't add up, contact the dealership ASAP and if they don't help contact the finance company they're also liable for fraudulent and hidden charges. If all else fails contact and attorney.   I'm in step two, I've contacted the finance company as the dealership said they would refund me and till this date has NOT.  BTW, they said that I didn't understand the contract instead of accepting they're liability.    For anyone that thinks they where overcharged contact me I'll be happy to share my documents so you can see what I mean.

6,"January 17, 2019","We went to have a part replaced with the original parts, instead the repair job was done with a part that was not original. We were not made aware of this before being billed for the repair and when asked why an original part was not used ""David's"" response was to get us a quote for the the part we originally wanted. We went to the dealership with the understanding that repairs done there would be done using the cars original parts and not a part that can be obtained from any other auto part store. ",1.4
7,"June 08, 2018",If you are in the market for a new or used vehicle please see Ana Valadez at Gillman Honda. She worked very hard to get my client what he wanted. She made every effort to accommodate him as well. She is the person you want working your deals. She got the price that my client was looking for and on a certified vehicle. ,5.0
8,"April 08, 2018","My wife and I wanted to buy a 2018 Honda Accord Sport.  I submitted an internet request to Gillman Honda and Kirit Khatri responded within minutes with a price that was several thousand dollars less than the other Honda dealerships. We met Kirit the next day.  He was very was respectful and courteous. I refused to pay $199.99 for the nitrogen in the tire add-on scam so he removed it. This was all done on a week day night and we have a 10 year old daughter that goes to school.  Kirit was very understanding and told us to come back the next Saturday to finalize everything.  Based on Kirit's professionalism, we filled a credit application and went home.  Kirit kept us updated as to the status of application before we returned on Saturday.  When the arrived on Saturday, Kirit was waiting on us with the car ready for delivery.  

However, the next couple of hours was a hassle to say the least.  Mike ""The accessories guy"" came over and wasted 20 minutes of our time trying to sell us all kinds of accessories that we didn't need and never asked for.  Then we finally met the most dangerous person in the dealership, the fiance manager, Vernon Quesnot.  Most dealerships make most of their profit on the ""back end"", which is any profit made after the car sale. This includes profit through selling products and services such as extended warranties, paint protection, GAP insurance, etc. They are trained to suck money out of your pockets while making it look like they're doing you a favor. He was no exception to the rule. He printed out fiance paperwork while talking to us and telling us how he works for the customer.  Included in the paperwork was all of the services cited above.  He acted like the services were a part of the overall price of the car as he was itemizing everything.  This raised the monthly payment of the car over $120.00.  That's approximately $7,200.00 over the life of the loan.   All to the dealership.  I could tell he was upset when I asked him to remove all of it.  I tried to be diplomatic and explained that I could buy all of the services for a fraction of the cost online. He responded by saying ""You are not going to beat me."" Nice.  That is when I finally saw the true colors of the dealership.  A pure money grab.  We finished up the paperwork and took delivery of the car.  However, as we were getting ready to leave, here comes Mike ""The accessories guy"" with one final pitch to sell us some overpriced accessories.  I brushed him off and left the dealership with our new car.  

So there it is, Gillman Honda.  The same as all the other dealerships.  No better, no less.  I wonder how these people sleep at night after taking advantage of the average working person.  Thankfully, I only buy a car every 15 or so  years, so I won't have to deal with these people again for a long time. ",3.0
9,"March 05, 2018","It was very easy via the Costco buying program to get to a better price for a new Ridgeline than any other dealer in the area.  I am very busy and time is very important to me.  Ana managed all aspects of the transaction and took personal attention to make sure the car was delivered within a few hours of my purchase.  Got the price I wanted on my trade in as well.

10,"February 28, 2018","As a former Honda of America Mfg associate I greatly appreciate the professionalism and knowledge that Ana Valadez demonstrated when I was in the market for a new car.  Ana Valadez represented the   Honda values from the initial contact through post sales.  As a follow-up, I asked for the opportunity to speak with Gillman Honda SA’s General Manager and expressed my appreciation for her professionalism and knowledge; and would have spoken with the Honda zone representative if on site.",4.8
11,"February 01, 2018","First i find it offensive they try to force you to get tint/fabric treatment/paint sealant/nitious they do not include this in the price and try to add it in at the tale end as a bit of a suprise!

One of the other things i disliked was that the sales manager actully tried saying my car is a rare one though this isnt true considering honda makes tons of my car though it was not an issue for me i feel like i need to tell people of the absolute shady things in my openion that go on here.

The staff is clueless, the tried delivering my car dirty then full of scratchs, they did buff most out but missed a few and attempted to make it right that said i still had to pay for a professonal wax job that cost me $90 to get the remander scratches out.

When callng gillman my experance is the left hand doesnt know what the right is doing. They will drop you into a voice mail with no warning even though you asked to speak to the person. You will be shuffelled around dept to dept.

I find they want you to jump for them when in fact they should be jumping for me...they forgot there working for the customer not the other way around.

I find the managment unwilling to talk like adults i actully paid cash for my car and though i have not completed signatures they needed (though i have been there multipule times to do so) there trying to tell me that people there wont be paid because of that even though i brought a certified cashiers check out of my account...they have my money and because of there buisness practices there trying to guilt me. I reminded the manager of that and in fact thats a buisness issue not my issue and ill be there tommarrow to sign papers regardless of personal inconvenience to them. 

If your wise just shop around...the internet is a great place to avoid jokers like this.

This is my openion only.

I recommend anyone who has issues with them just report them to the dmv...they control there licensing.",1.4
12,"January 26, 2018","After doing our research on the car we wanted to buy regarding a fair market price, we sent emails to several dealers in the area.  San Marcos Honda never responded to any of our emails until days later; actually after we had already purchased a car.  Only Gillman Honda and Fernandez Honda responded timely with actual good offers.  We decided to begin our on-site visit with Gillman Honda and was assigned Ana Valadez from their internet department.  From the beginning, she endeavored to figure out exactly what we were looking for and how she could meet our desires.  She was friendly and informative, never pushy or overbearing.  She didn't play any games, but readily took our counteroffers back to her manager and got him to agree to the price we felt was fair.  The process after that went very quickly.  We were never hassled by any of the staff regarding extra options or treatments.  The dealership does have water, ice tea and coffee available if you want it, as well as snack and soda machines.

She stayed engaged but was not pushy as I went contemplated which vehicle would be best for me. She helped find that vehicle for me and came in at a great price, lower than competitors. She was there to help me through the process from start to finish and went above and beyond to assist me in getting the vehicle delivered. For customer service that can’t be beat, contact Ana Valadez at Gillman Honda.

20,"August 05, 2017","We used USAAs car buying service, placed the car on hold with a credit card, and scheduled an appointment to purchase the car.  My husband flew in from out-of-state (over 5 hours) and the Finance Manager at Gillman over-rode our hold and sold the car to someone else.  Unfortunately,  it looks like that was the only color and trim in all of Texas.  ",2.0
21,"July 29, 2017","I was down to a minivan.  For an active family it's a little difficult running 3 kids to different appointments, a wife that travels, and my own work schedule.  I wanted another car.

We had been looking at different makes and models, but having owned Hondas before, steered the wife into looking at Civics, and narrrowed down to an EX trim.

Now the easily part...  I got online and and sent out requests for for pricing to 15 dealerships in Texas.  I explained exactly what I wanted.  I asked for a breakdown in pricing to include an out the door price.

My current 2007 Odyssey (still runs like a champ!) was purchased in San Antonio (new via the internet), and after culling the herd, San Antonio still remains the most competitive concentration of Honda dealerships in the state in my opinion.  But....

Ana Valadez is the ""peach"" of Gillman .  Told her she wouldn't be able to beat a quote I received from a Dalls dealership, and thanks for trying.  She challenged me to show me the written quote.  I normally don't like to do that, and never have before, but I did this time.  I told her it was a really good deal and I would understand if she couldn't or wouldn't be able to beat the price.

I don't like being wrong and would normally not admit to it anyway, but I was wrong.  She gave me a drive out price lower than any other dealership in the San Antonio, DFW, Houston, and Austin metro areas.

Ana, was extremely professional as was all of the staff I visited with at Gillman.  She was very thorough and explained every detail very well.

If your hard earned money is important to you, if you are willing so spend a few days on the internet, and if you are willing to make a drive to San Antonio (which as a native Texan, S.A. is not that far from Waco) go see Ana Valadez!",5.0
22,"June 12, 2017","Lies! Sure, Google Reviews show good ratings. Try venturing out to Yelp and other sources before you show up to this place. I read about all of the additional fees you incur when purchasing a used vehicle so I decided to reach out to a sales rep to determine the price of the vehicle. I specifically mentioned the reviews and asked for the final price due to finding such reviews. Bruce Paiva did not give me the price of the vehicle but reassured me he was the guy to buy a vehicle from... He told me to check the reviews of him from the Gillman Honda site. So he sent me a message and said ""I'll make sure you get the tax title and license for free AND take $1300 off the vehicle. "" (SEE PICTURES). So, I drove to SA from Austin, he didn't even meet me, he his 'associate' meet me. Even after he said the time I proposed was fine and that he was the person to buy from. Mimi, the associate was friendly. I enjoyed chatting with her but it came down the cost of the vehicle, already priced above book then you add almost 2k in fees for the dealership. I know buying a car is more expensive at a dealership than private party. HOWEVER, I only made the drive due to the conversation with Bruce. The price of the vehicle ended up being 2k more than sticker price. Mimi said they don't list the out the door price or straight up inform you because then no one would come in see them. So, apparently once you fall in love with the vehicle they hope you will pay 2-4k or maybe even more on some vehicles more than their worth, even a 2012-2013 vehicle. I showed Mimi the texts on my phone and she said there was no way that's what he meant. I left and then Bruce messaged me and said ""I heard you want to not getting the car...I told you we could get you $1300 off the vehicle not 3 thousand."" His misuse of words/grammar not my typing. [see pics]. So, to get this straight, the fees and taxes ARE NOT part of the cost of the vehicle itself. In his text he said I'll make sure you get the TAX, TITLE, and LICENSE FOR FREE ANDDD take $1300 off the vehicle. If you're looking at a vehicle online and come across this review, I really hope you think twice or go in knowing you're going to pay 2k more than sticker price, which most vehicles are already significantly marked up. They work on commission. -Jaimie ",1.2
23,"May 15, 2017",Joe Cardenas Jr was the internet salesman  that I worked with to come and and look at a vehicle for my daughter.  the vehicle appeared to be everything that was stated  on the dealer's website. Joe was courteous and professional. The salesman manager was great and worked to get this vehicle in our hands that same evening. This was the easiest car purchase I've ever done. very happy. They even promised us a second key to the vehicle that we will pick up next Friday. Awesome!!,4.8
24,"May 08, 2017",Service department less than professional.  They did their best best to ignore me then acted like they were doing me a favor by talking to me.  James Holderman is the worst service advisor I have ever had the displeasure to meet.  I will never take this Honda back to Gillman.,1.0
25,"October 21, 2016",We recently picked 6 car dealers to visit in our pursuit of a new car. We were selling our old car Toyota Sienna Van (Already had a buyer) and had our own financing. You were our last stop. We wanted to look at  the Honda CRV. We met Patricia and had a wonderful experience. She is very knowledgeable and very personable. We felt we had met a friend who was looking out for our interest instead of a salesperson pushing a particular car. We appreciated her help and are greatful to her for making this a nice experience. And we love our new car. Thomas and Brenda Nursick,4.5

28,"June 10, 2016","My Wife and I purchased a new, 2016 Honda Pilot EX-L today from Gillman Honda of San Antonio . Our sales consultant was Mr. Robert Henderson, and let me tell you, this gentleman went above and beyond in helping my Wife to be able to get in a vehicle that she is really happy with and will enjoy for quite some time, and not only that, but the way we were treated at this dealer was really excellent.  Mr. Henderson was very patient and understanding regarding to what features she was really looking for on the Pilot, was not pushy in any way or manner, or try to sell us a vehicle we didn't like, want or with features that we didn't need. Overall, he is a great person to do business with.  Another gentleman  I want to mention in this review is Mr. Tony Franklin, the Finance Manager that helped us with the financing at Gillman Honda of San Antonio. Great guy to conduct business with and talk to. Mr. Franklin treated us like family, with honesty, was very professional, and very patiently took his time to explain everything in detail. And we very much appreciate it.
Last but not least, the Gillman Honda of San Antonio management, great people. 
If you are looking for a great deal, a place where you are treated with respect and with great customer service, visit this dealer and give them a little bit of your time and you probably won't regret it.  Thanks to everyone that was involved with this deal.

34,"May 09, 2015","Over the last year I've been dealing with Mr. Dan Tarr in the Gillman Honda of San Antonio service department.  I was smart enough at the time in 2007 to buy a service contract.  My Cr-V decided last year to start falling apart.  Dan worked with me to get everything covered under the service contract before the warranty ran out.  Any time I came in he greeted me by name, got everything set up and arranged the rental car (which was also covered by the service contract.)  Drop off and back out the door was usually under 15 minutes.  The longer wait was for the rental car courtesy vehicle to pick me up.  

He always called if an issue popped up to keep me in the loop.  

I highly recommend dealing with him if you have any maintenance issues with your vehicle.  I rated the service price at 3 stars only because price-wise I can find it cheaper elsewhere but deal with longer wait times and crappy customer service.",4.6

Sales person and finanace person were easy to talk to and delivered what was promised. There was no hidden fee or gimmick. I drove from Austin and it was worth my time and trip. None of dealers in central Texas came close to Gillman. They bring cars from Houston port, and none of Houstons big dealers came close in price. According to my research, their price was not far from the nations best price.

39,"August 25, 2014","My wife and I usually do a lot of comparative shopping prior to purchasing new vehicles, but Gillman Honda in San Antonio was our 2nd and final stop this time. Tony Woodard, our very professional and patient salesperson, offered us a relatively low price (based on sales price data from Edmunds.com and KBB.com) for the new Odyssey and worked hard and was able to get us an above average amount for our trade-in. He went above and beyond by getting the vehicle delivered from a dealership near Houston to Gillman at The Forum on the same day. Not an easy feat given that it was a Saturday, the busiest day of the week for many dealerships. 

As for the remaining staff at Gillman, they were professional, friendly, and very competent. Jennifer Gross, the Finance person, did a wonderful job laying out several different financing and warranty options for us. Also, Sean was very helpful with accessories.

I have owed a 1996 Oddesye and a 1994 Civic, both these vehicles were serviced by Gillman, they were sold over the years, but I obtain a high resale value on them due to having the autos serviced at Gillman.  2003 Odesye will be my daughters car once she graduates from Highschool, she rather have the pilot but that is whole different story.  My 2005 Pilot was very dependable, I loved it had low miles and was in excellent condition, however my hubby sat in the new one, an all the features that were on it were amazing, we test drove the 2013 and 2012, loved both of them. It didn't take me long to fall in love again with my new pilot.  We got the 2012, as it had the navigation system along with the bells and wistles.

63,"December 25, 2011","I bought a 2011 Subaru Outback from Gillman Honda - San Antonio (Actually three dealers colocated; Honda, Subaru, and Mitsu) in late November 2011 about 30 minutes before they closed. The Outback had 4100+ miles on it and it was flawless. The only thing it didn't come with was a retractable rear cargo cover. Since I carry my golf clubs back there I decided to purchase a cargo cover myself. After owning the Outback for a few weeks I was re-reading the paperwork and noticed that the ""used car"" sticker listed a retractable rear cargo cover as being included (it was hard to miss since the printing ran onto a dark red part of the ""form"" sticker.) I returned to the dealership a few days later and inquired about the cover. I was told that they were not responsible for printing errors, but that they wanted me to be satisfied with my purchase so they offered me a partial credit toward what I paid for the cover. I'm a reasonable person and realize that mistakes are made so I was happy that they didn't flat out refuse to make me ""whole"" again. In fact I was satisfied to the point that my wife and I purchased a 2012 Subaru Forester last week from Gillman Subaru (co-located with the Honda dealer.) While being shown the features of the Forester the salesman showed us where the Forester's cargo cover stows away when not needed. As soon as I got home I checked my Outback and sure enough, the cargo cover was ""stowed"" in the floor of the rear cargo area. Wanting to do the right thing I returned to the Honda dealership and explained what I had discovered and said I would return the cover I purchased and give the dealership back the money they credited me with. The manager I spoke to (don't remember his name) thanked me for my honesty and integrity, but said that they had already accounted for the money (about $90) and that it was a small price to pay if it made a customer satisfied.

Overall I had a great experience with both Gillman Honda and Gillman Subaru -San Antonio. I would highly recommend them to anyone and they will definately be my first choice 10-15 years from now when our Subaru's need replacing (sorry guys - we expect our Subies to keep going, and going, and going.)",4.7

After a few visits to the closest dealer, it was plain that the customer was not as important as the service employees, who paid little attention to appointments, customer's time and keeping customers informed.

So I tried Gillman, thinking I needed a new battery. I called just after getting a root canal, hoping I wouldn't have to wait for hours for service as I needed to buy and start some prescriptions.

I didn't mention the dental work but was told to come right over to the express service center. They had enough staff to work with a number of people. They tested my battery, showed me the results, put in a new one, and I was out in no time. Gillman is my new dealer. ",4.8

I've heard good things about Gillman and now realize we should have just gone there first.

Gillman was so willing to work with us we drove away with a nicer CRV, more add-ons and more warranty coverage than we were hoping for. Buying from Gillman was a great experience. Especially considering what we had been through the previous day. Gillman is not your typical car dealership. Our salesman Chris, as well as everyone else we dealt with there, was fantastic.

I've been looking for a few weeks and finally narrowed down the exact car and colors I was interested in.  I shopped around and found a dealership in San Antonio with a price that was dramatically lower than those in Austin... about 4K lower!  Unfortunately, the car in the color that I wanted sold before I could get everything set up and go buy it.  They tried to get me another car transferred in, but weren't able to.  I called Gillman, who I knew had a black one like I wanted, and they were willing to honor the price of the other dealership.  I immediately drove down to San Antonio to pick up my car.  Bernard was great on the phone and got all information that would be needed from me.  When we arrived, he was friendly and met us at the door, took me out to see the new car and make sure I was happy with it, and then we did the paperwork.  It took about an hour total, which I consider pretty good.  The finance manager did try to sell me the extended warranty, but was still very respectful when I declined it.  Meanwhile, Bernard had gotten and set all of my preferences in the car for the radio, the alarm, door locks, etc so that I wouldn't have to bother with that.  He went through and showed me where the things were in the manual that I would be most likely to use, and we were on our way.  Overall, it was an easy, pleasant car-buying experience that only took a few hours total.  I will definitely recommend and go back to Gillman for my next car.

Although I live more than 550 miles from San Antonio, I was able to experience an excellent internet car buying experience with Gillman Honda.  I used dealerrater.com to request a price quote on a 2011 Honda Accord EX-L 3.5 on December 21, 2010.  Within a minute of submitting my request, I received an automated email response from Chris Lee that confirmed receipt of my inquiry.  A short time later Chris sent me an “Out the Door” price quote that gave me my total cost to purchase the vehicle; a critical piece of information that I needed to do a comparative analysis of other price quotes that I had received.  Two days later I received a follow-up email from Chris who asked me to confirm that I had received his quote.   I called Chris that afternoon to accept his offer.   The following day Chris sent me a FEDEX overnight package containing the documents that needed to be signed to complete the transaction and a prepaid FEDEX envelope that I used to send the signed documents back.  The car was picked up the next day and driven to El Paso.
The experience with Chris Lee at Gillman Honda was totally opposite from the negative stereotypes often associated with buying a car.  Chris provided outstanding customer service throughout the process.   He was responsive to my initial inquiry and subsequent questions, offered the car at a good price, did not waver from the original offer, and did not apply irritating sales tactics.

Showed a car with 'This is in great condition, low mileage and exactly what you need'. It would be nice if the line was sincere and he wasn't pointing to the wrong model type and it wasn't a standard which apparently he wasn't listening..... Kind of a low point for our shopping day.

95,"August 06, 2010","I have just purchased a new 2010 Accord EX sedan from Gillman Honda in San Antonio,TX.  I am thrilled with it!  This is my fourth Honda vehicle in 25 plus years. I have previously owned three Civics, all with manual transmissions.  My inquiry was made on the Honda Website.  I selected three San Antonio dealerships requesting information on an Accord LX-VP sedan, with a manual transmission in the White Taffeta color.  Christopher Lee replied by e-mail immediately, letting me know that he was researching my inquiry.  Christoper followed up on his findings with a very pleasant phone call. Much to his regret, he had located only one vehicle with my requirements.  It was in El Paso, TX but not the color that I wanted.  He said he would be happy to have it brought in.  I told him it was not necessary to bring the car in.  He then invited me to come out and test drive an LX-VP with the five speed automatic transmission.  Even though my present Civic LX was eight years old, it had great pick up, something I really didn't think an automatic could match.  I underestimated the advances that Honda has continually provided over the years.  I made an appointment; test drove three different Honda models, the LX-VP, a Civic EX and an Accord EX.  I chose the EX in the color that I wanted; and with all of my other requirements!  The purchase process that followed after my decision was made, was great!  I personally complimented Christopher Lee for providing such a highly professional, knowledgeable, curteous manner.  He explained my car's mechanics, new features and technology in a friendly, unrushed way.  I met three other Gillman reps, Ramon in the Financial department, Clay in Accessories sales and Shirley in the Service department.  All are exceptional personnel!  I highly recommend doing business with Gillman Honda and with Christopher Lee.    ",4.8
96,"August 05, 2010","I have purchased my first Honda from Gillman Honda. My salesperson was Tom Holstlaw. He is GREAT to work with!  He explained all of the features and pointed out how they would be beneficial to me. He listed to what I wanted and found the perfect Civic for me  and in the color that I wanted. I received a larger trade in value from what I had been offered at other dealers. The price I received, I felt is fair and reasonable. The whole sales experience from start to finish was easy and stress free. Ralph in the business office was GREAT too! I would recommend Gillman Honda and Tom Holstlaw to everyone in the South Texas area looking for a Honda. ",5.0
97,"August 03, 2010","We found the dealership to be professional, timely, and courteous.  After visiting several other dealerships over the past couple of weeks, we found Gillman to be a breath of fresh air.  It was a pleasant experience from start to finish.  I highly recommend this dealership.  We will be back for future car purchases.",4.8
98,"August 02, 2010","This is the second time I've dealt with Gillman over the past two years. The first time was far a ""starter"" car I was going to transfer over to my son as he graduated from college. The experience, especially lack of games, brought me back the second time. Anthony new what I wanted and had the car waiting for me when I arrived. After a quick inspection, it was onto the ""extra'"" lady and then quickly to finance, who handled the transaction professionaly and quickly. I will be back...",5.0
99,"July 30, 2010","I am a repeat customer at Gillman Honda having already purchased an 05 Honda Accord. I returned to Gillman to purchase a new Honda CRV. I felt very comfortable with my salesman, Tom Holstlaw, who was friendly, helpful, and very understanding as he listened to exactly what I was looking for in a vehicle. I also appreciate Business Manager, Ray Tello, and salesman, Chris Lee, who were also so friendly and helpful. My five year relationship with Gillman Honda continues to be a positive experience.",5.0
100,"July 19, 2010","I had really good service from all of the departments and they did not stop working with me until I was satisfied. A+ Customer Service and I will probably go back with my 2 sons when they start looking for a reliable car. Thanks, Gillman!

101,"July 16, 2010","I went to the other Honda dealership on I-10 (Gunn).   I visited them last year when I bought my first Honda from Gillman.  They gave me a firm price that was $700 less than Gillman, but when the wrote up the contract it was $250 more than Gillman.  Next time I'm just going straight to Gillman.  They are straight shooters. Anthony De La Paz was very accommodating and Hugh Forman made the paperwork almost painless. ",5.0
102,"July 16, 2010","Hi--

I worked out a price on a Honda Odyssey in advance.  Anthony DeLaPaz worked very hard to make us happy and ensure that everything was perfect.  For example there was a very small  defect on the pinstripe.  He had the installer return and repair this even though we would have let the very minor defect go.  Ralph, the finance manager was a pleasure to work with and gave us time to figure out what the best option for financing was for us.

103,"January 10, 2010","This past Saturday, the 31st of December, I drove all the way to San Antonio to buy a Honda Accord from this dealership on IH 35. Ralph Marsh emailed me and called me several times to invite me there and told me he had the perfect car for me, at the perfect price, with no hassles.  He even went so far as to send me an email were the price for an Accord LXP was $19,479, which is a great price and the reason I picked this dealership to buy my new car. 
When I arrived around 5:00 PM, I found the car I wanted, a white Accord tag H00278.  Mr. Marsh confirmed on his list this was good to go, so I test drove the vehicle and really liked it.  So I parked on the side of the building as instructed, went inside to start the paperwork; Mr. Marsh even told me it was just a matter of 2 hours before I could drive away with my new vehicle, and they would even offer me great financing, so I  filled in the credit application, and that is when this place completely lost me.  The ""GSM"" (general sales manager?) showed up to inform me that this car was NOT part of the email I was holding in my hand, he said they could not sell me this car at the mentioned price, but that I had a choice of colors to pick from, other than this one.  He said this car had not been on the lot 100 days, only 83 days, and this was the reason they could not sell it.
They offered me other cars in different colors.  Instead, I went with Ancira Nissan, where I got EXCELLENT service, a great price, and did not have to put up with the usual BS car salesmen are well know for.  Gillman is easily the worst car buying attempt I have ever dealt with, ever!  Lies, misinformation, more lies, and the people aren't even men enough to admit to it.  Needless to say, I will NEVER go near Gillman or a Honda vehicle, just based on this experience. I suggest you do the same.",1.5
104,"August 21, 2009","After trying to buy an Odyssey in Houston TX, we ended up driving 6hrs return trip and buying from Bill Greenfield of Gilman San Antonio instead.  The people that work at the dealerships in Houston (with the exception of Russell Smith Honda, that didnt have the van in the color we wanted) are crooked and scammers. Ray H at Russell Smith is awesome and honest. ",5.0
