0,"August 30, 2018","Bought new 2018 Traverse. Took into dealer for routine oil change, shift problem with trans, and wind noise on door. Service had the vehicle for four days. Changed engine oil and flushed transmission. Told me I would need to make appointment with body shop to address wind noise. During the time in service, no one could give me status on the vehicle. When I got home with the vehicle, I discovered grime smear on the headliner. I wrote this up in the customer satisfaction survey and the mgr reached out. Had several conversations with mgr over 2 week be period and was prepared to give them a second chance when he called me one last time to go over the issues, suggesting that he needed to personally verify my issues before I could bring the vehicle in for service. I have bought 15 new Chevy's and several used models during my adult life. Three were bought from this dealership over the past six years.  In my opinion, the service department is under staffed and lacks qualified personal. Even the cashier gave me attitude when I questioned the sheets she said I needed to sign to release my vehicle.

1,"November 30, 2017","Had a schedualed oil change at 8:40, checked in at 8:20, left and came back an hour and a half later, and my vehicle was still in waiting line, after talking with my rep, it took another 20 or so minutes for them to pull my vehicle into the garage, thatâ€™s a 2 hr wait before they even touched my vehicle, then another 45 minutes for them to finish the maintenance, what was the point of having an appointment, should have bought a ford or went somewhere else.this is my 3rd service appointment and very one of them was miserable.",1.6

4,"March 07, 2017","Dropped off vehicle 2015 Chevrolet Tahoe on Wednesday March 1st 2017 1 week later still no phone call from Frank Botello no updates guessing because fixing oil pan under warranty is not making money so I'm not a rush for service...Frank insured me he would call us to update and that would be ready by Monday one week later not even a phone call no car...I will never take vehicles to autonation chevrolet service and will let the many co-workers, friends, and family know to not ever take vehicles to autonation for service sucks",1.0
5,"December 15, 2015",Having warranty work done on new Yukon Denali.  Vehicle has been at shop for 1 month today and still not ready.  Had a vibration so they are replacing 2 wheels that were out of round and 3 tires.  Replacing broke headlight and plastic pieces by windows that were coming off.  Does it really take over a month to have this work done.  Hopefully I get it back soon.  WILL NEVER DEAL WITH THIS DEALER AGAIN!,1.3
6,"April 04, 2014","Got a great trade in value and love my truck, bought our second truck here as well. Second time around wasnt as great as the first. Our salesman got the wrong pay off value and caused all kinds of problems. It was fixed with negative remark on my account because of the second car we traded in but I still recommend this place.",5.0
7,"October 30, 2013",My advisor Frank Botello did an excellent job in ensuring the safety of myself and my children. Our car kept turning off and he did and excellent job making sure the problem was fixed and then took extra time to follow up with us to make sure everything was still ok. We appreciate everything you did for my family. I would go back any time to get serviced there. ,5.0
