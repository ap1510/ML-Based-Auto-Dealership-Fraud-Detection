2,"March 17, 2020","Buying and owning a Sewell Infiniti is absolutely the ONLY way to purchase a vehicle.  Everyone there knows and takes care of us - EVERYONE!  We consider many to be ""family""!",5.0
3,"March 04, 2020","Very disappointed with Sewell’s price gouging. I understand making a profit BUT not their money hungry tactics. $2200.00 to replace two single head lights. One didn’t even need it, but they insisted it be changed. I hope people read this and take heed when choosing Sewell Infiniti in Fort Worth.",1.0
4,"February 27, 2020",We’ve had two Infiniti vehicles and it’s always a pleasure to bring them in and to know that Lizzie Bettis is going to make the transition of dropping off/picking up so smooth.  My family and I really appreciate her and her knowledge of the vehicles.  She’s the best!,5.0

6,"December 27, 2017","This was our first Infiniti QX60 buying experience and we had a wonderful experience with Sewell Fort worth. The salesperson Adam was very helpful and was always quick in responding to our queries. The process was so smooth and straightforward, mostly done over phone/text and no pressure to visit the dealership. We visited only once when we felt like. Adam answered all our questions regarding the feature details of various packages. They did their best to make sure that we get the brand new car at a great price.I would definitely refer them to someone who is looking to buy Infiniti. I hope they do the same if I need their help in services and post sale issues, if any.",5.0
7,"October 27, 2017","I came to this dealership to look at purchasing a used vehicle...  I came in preapproved for 35k and had 2500-4K to put down.. looked at a 2014 Q60.. I originally asked to meet with GM but instead he sent me to a fella named Adam, I believe. The sales person took me to view the Q60.. but didn’t allow me to test drive it much less offer a test drive! I also asked to see a 2011 lexus they had across the street.. he of course, never brought the Lexus over.. I waited 45 mins to end up with a piece of paper with the price offer and what my payments would be.. wow.. now why would I purchase a car without driving it?!?!  No worries.. I took my business elsewhere! I ended up going to park place and purchasing a Lexus! You guys need to work on your customer service skills!! Unbelievable!! ",1.4
8,"June 06, 2016","I bought this car at the beginning of March 2016. I thought this dealership was the very best by how they treated me up to the sale. Very quick responses to phone calls and text messages--really quick and very cooperative in every way.

The technician who prepared the car before the sale replaced the fuel tank cap, so apparently he saw a problem with the check engine light and apparently thought that replacing the fuel tank cap would correct the problem. On the 770 mile drive home the check engine light came on (again), and I replaced the fuel tank cap (again) and the dealership popped for the cost. The check engine light came on again, and I took the car to a local repair shop. They checked the evaporative vapor emission control system and replaced two hoses. I am now outside the 30-day warranty period. The check engine light came on again. This time the repair shop did a comprehensive (and expensive--I paid for it) analysis of the evaporative vapor emission control system and determined that the vapor pressure sensor in the charcoal canister was sticking. This component is not available separately; it comes only as an integral part of the charcoal canister, which means that to finally correct the problem, which manifested itself prior to the sale and well within the warranty period, I must replace the charcoal canister.

Because I felt that this problem should have been properly diagnosed and corrected as part of the inspection and preparation before the car was sold to me (instead of simply putting on a new fuel tank cap--twice) and that the replacement of the fuel tank cap a second time during the warranty period acknowledged but didn't correct the problem but simply ran out the clock on the warranty period, I asked the dealership to honor the warranty and to cover the cost of this repair under the warranty.

After I wrote to the dealership twice and made a telephone call (which was not returned) and five days went by, the dealership sent me a text message saying that because we are out of the warranty period, they won't cover the charcoal canister. So once they ran out the clock on the warranty period, they consider themselves to be home free, even though the problem manifested itself both before the sale and during the warranty period but was not properly corrected.

I find that service unacceptable and unethical, and that is why I am writing this evaluation.",2.4
9,"May 16, 2016","We have been nothing but impressed with Sewell Infiniti.  I bought a car from there around 8 months ago.  It was an easy process, including the financial part.  The service department is just as amazing.  Sewell really is a totally different experience when it comes to dealing with a dealership.  I will buy from them again next time I get a car.  ",5.0
