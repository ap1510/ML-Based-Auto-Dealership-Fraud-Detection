1,"January 19, 2020",All employees were amazing.  Brought vehicle to me to look at. Went and purchased and did everything I asked. Great salesman.  Will use him again.  Owner was very nice.  Came out and introduced himself and talked with me.  Couldn't ask for a better experience.,5.0
2,"January 10, 2020","Bo knew we were coming from Dallas to purchase a vehicle. We arrived to the Dealer and find out the fender flares are off the truck not a big deal if you tell me ahead of time that you hand to paint them I would have been fine with that. Do paperwork and pay for the truck then we wait for an hour to find the truck was dirty and my sales guy Bo scratched  my window on the new vehicle with a razor blade taking off the as is sticker. Completely disappointed. Not to mention we were leaving and my wife following me in our car ""you have no tag""!   Just care about your customer a little bit Bo.",1.8
3,"October 03, 2017","I had a horrible experience today. It seems they take appointments now for oil changes and service. I had my last oil change done there several months back and it was first come first serve and has been for the 4 years I owned my Venza. The Service Rep told me there were a few cars ahead of me...no problem. I saw 4 or 5 cars go in ahead of me but by this time I had invested 2 hours of wait time. My car was not even in the bay yet after 2 hrs 15 mins. There were two people handling the Service Dept. Evidently, when I was told there were a 'few' cars ahead of me....my Service Rep forgot to check with the other Service Rep and add that got her appts in front of me as well. By this time I had invested so much time I hated to leave. 30 minutes later my car went into the bay. Total time for an oil change and tire rotation (and upsell on stuff I didn't want) 3 hours 45 minutes. I'm done. I'm about ready for a new car but I don't want to deal with Service for Toyota so guess that narrows my choice to Honda or Ford.",2.8

7,"January 01, 2016","I went to have the hood latch fixed on my Rav and after 2 1/2 hours they basically told me to take it somewhere else which I did and they had the latch fixed within an hour.  Also, while waiting at Patterson toyota in Marshall, I decided to look at one of their used vehicles, when the salesman returned from talking with the sales manager, they quoted 1,000 dollars above what the car was selling for on their website.  They also offered me 2,000 below trade in on my vehicle.  Come on guys, at least know what your vehicle is listed for on your own website.  I had bought 3 cars from Marshall Toyota before Patterson took it over, needless to say, I won't be buying from them in the future and would discourage anyone else from visiting them either.  I rated them a 1 star only because zero wasn't an option.",1.2
8,"December 12, 2013","To Whom It May Concern:

After getting bad customer service at Loving Toyota in Lufkin, TX, I emailed sixteen other Toyota dealerships in the East Texas area to see if anyone else would like to sell me a 2014 Toyota Tundra. After several dealerships responded with their best prices, there were two that stood out from the rest.

Danny Cole’s in Marshall, Texas and Fred Haas in Spring, Texas, both came in with great prices and one came back with an offer on our trade-in that we could not turn down. Danny Cole’s in Marshall, Texas end up saving us $6,723.00 more than what Loving Toyota in Lufkin, TX offered us for the same 2014 Toyota Tundra and the same trade-in.

Fred Haas in Spring, Texas also offered us best price on the 2014 Toyota Tundra but their offer on our trade-in was $2,000 less than what Danny Cole’s offered us.

So, long story short, if you’re looking for a great deal at the best price, go to Danny Cole’s in Marshall, Texas or Fred Haas in Spring, Texas. Both of these dealerships are professional, know how to treat a customer, and will offer you a fair price on a new vehicle.

Best regards,
