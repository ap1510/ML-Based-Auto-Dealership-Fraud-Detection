0,"January 29, 2020","I had my car towed to the body shop and when I went to check on it, I noticed that there was a cat living in it.  I notified the shop employees and they reassured me that they would seal up the windows so it wouldn't happen again.  My car turned out to be totalled, so when I returned to remove my personal belongings I opened the trunk and pieces of the car were laying on top of my personal belongings,  I had some new clothes and important paperwork that were ruined.  I called to talk to the GM and I was told that I had to speak to the body shop manager first, I again asked to talk to the GM and I was told that he would call me back.  He never returned my call, but the body shop Manager called me and asked me ""So what do you want me to do about it "" I would not recommend this place. ",1.0

2,"February 25, 2019","Very disappointed.  My truck was in service for nine days, before they looked at it.  I had to go to the dealership to get an update on the status of the truck as they would not return my phone calls.  My truck has the Ford death wobble,  which was not fixed and is currently back at the dealership for another attempt at fixing the problem.  This is actually the third time now that my truck has been in the shop over the last few months.  It is difficult to watch advertising about how Gene Messer does business the right way and how tough Ford trucks are, while I am having to find a ride.  Hopefully this time they will be able to put Humpty Dumpty back together again. ",1.2
3,"December 22, 2018",The Saturday before Christmas seemed like a good time for an Oil change and brake check.. Good advice on remaining life of brake pads. I have more knowledge and a few choices after the Holidays and Football games. Good visit with all the staff in service and the shuttle driver,5.0
4,"September 24, 2018","Brought my car in on a Monday to have the cruise control fixed for the second time (first time was by a Ford dealership in Utica, NY).  I was told a technician couldn't look at the car for 2 to 4 days and that I had to leave the car there.  I spoke to the service manager and he said he would have a technician look at it the next day.  He lied!  On Thursday I got a call saying that the a technician had finally diagnosed that the cruise control needed replacing again (Surprise), and they would get to it on Friday.  I was without my car for 5 days.  They would not allow me to make an appointment I had to leave the car there.  Totally unacceptable.",2.2

7,"January 08, 2018","We are a Ford Family for as long as I  can remember. Thomas has been my agent for the past 12+ years and through all of my purchase, I have to say thank you for all your help from my first purchase to our most recent and as long as Thomas is at Gene Messer Ford, we will continue to go back to him.  Congrats on your 20+ years of dedicated service.! We are enjoying our new 2018 escape and a  great change from a large suv to a more compact suv, perfect size! Love it! ",5.0

9,"January 03, 2018","I've been a costumer of Gene Messer since I bought my new truck back in 2013, and up until the summer before last I had no issues, regular maintenance and inspections were great. Then I had to have my truck into the body shop for some pretty extensive work on the front end,I specifically asked it be sent there because it was my dealership, the truck was still quite new and I figured they'd be my best bet fro OEM parts and up until then, great service seemed the norm. But I had to bring my truck back in 4 times before they finally wrapped up all the details, after it had supposedly been ""completed.""

 Then about a month ago, I had my passenger side window busted out, I was travelling and needed the window fixed immediately, so I had it done elsewhere, But they said it would be better to go to the dealer to make sure the tint matched. So I called in explained what I needed, a new window needed the tint matched, they asked me to come in, so I did, they quoted me about 35 dollars and then decided to tell me that there tint guy wouldn't be in for a few days, which they could have easily told me over the phone, instead of wasting my time. Then I go back to get it done, along with my usual oil and filter change and regular maintenance, but when I check my bill I see that they charged me well over 60 dollars just for the window tint, ridiculous, Also as a side I was told that they would wash the vehicle for me since I had an issue prior, they did not.  

I then received an email survey and I conveyed to Ford my disappointment with that service, Then weeks later Ford follows up to ask if Gene Messer had reached out to me to make things right, and I could only respond that I had not heard a thing from Gene Messer. 

Then today, I notice I have a coolant leak, I find the origination point, do a little research, find its a common issue with my make and model, I call to explain what the issue is and get a quote, but they say they have to look at it and cannot quote over the phone. Fine, I ask if I could bring it in. They say sure they look up when there may be an opening, they ask if I can be there in 15 minutes, I say sure and head out from work. I get there, the customer agent looks me up sees I have set up an appointment to have my truck looked at, then tells me it would be 2 days before they could see it and that I would have to leave my truck there to be ""in line"". 

I promptly replied no, I cannot be without my primary source of transportation for 2 days just to have them look at something that I already have identified, and they could fix in 45 minutes. And also I ask why would they ask me to come out if they could not look at the vehicle for 2 days? They respond that I had probably been talking to a call center, which may be, but I doubt it, and even so they should have a system of communication to prevent these sorts of issues. 

So I left, I took my truck to a very good reliable shop here in Lubbock that I knew could do the work, and 45 minutes after I dropped it off, my truck was back in my possession repaired. So I am just about fed up with the lack of customer service that I seem to be getting lately with Gene Messer. I would say unless it is a warranted issue that they should have to fix, take your business elsewhere, I can point you to at least one better place.     ",1.2

11,"December 21, 2017","My heater wasn't working 2 days before a big cold front was coming. I first called another Ford dealership and they couldn't get me in for almost a week. I called Gene Messer Ford on 19th and Loop 289 and spoke to Ryan and he said they could get me in Today! What's more he said they could make sure I had a ride and even Free rental car for a couple days if they had to keep it. Great! I took my car in and met Matt. He said the same and was as courteous and professional as could be! They honored my warranty, got my heater back in tip top shape and even washed and vacuumed my car! They got me to work on time and picked up on time and the shuttle drivers were great too! Both Matt and Ryan were adamant that they Wanted to get my heater working before this cold snap hit. And they sure did. In this day and age there is a real Shortage of service. But not at Gene Messer Ford. I will not go anywhere else if I ever need service again. I HIGHLY recommend them!

19,"October 18, 2017","Dealership personnel were very helpful and I am grateful for their efforts. However, $1,650 to replace a headlight is preposterous and downright offensive.

31,"August 24, 2017","I had just moved-in my college student at Texas Tech when I was departing the campus parking lot heading back to Colorado on a Sunday.  I had an unfortunate car breakdown where steam was coming from underneath the hood. Forced to spend another night in Lubbock, it was recommended to visit Messer dealership the following day.

Promptly showing up on Monday by 0700 (first in line) I was informed that the dealership was days behind schedule and they would not be able to work me in until Wednesday.  Of course this was unacceptable to me and my predicament being from out of state.  My only request is to have my Ford Edge be evaluated that day so I can make the appropriate decision as to extend another hotel stay (not fun) or make other arrangements to get back to my residence in Colorado.

I was pleasantly surprised when I was informed about 1300 that my vehicle had been diagnosed and parts are in house and would be ready by 1700! I am grateful for the service department on managing to work me in but also getting me on the road later that day (1630).

39,"August 07, 2017","Although the people who work here are nice, do not be fooled by the cost of certain services. In my particular case they quoted me a price of $53.00 to change a light on truck, a light bulb for my brake light to be exact. Being skeptical of this price, I went to a nearby autozone where I purchased a bulb for $3.00 tax and all. Using only a screwdriver to unscrew two screws and approximately 2 minutes I changed the bulb with little effort. In short the people were nice, but don't be susceptible to overpaying for simple services, such as changing a bulb.",3.0

52,"March 01, 2017","I called ahead a week in advance to set up a service appointment for a recall. The recall notice said that it would only take 1/2 day to complete. The dealership said it would take 1 1/2 max. I called multiple times to check on the status of my vehicle with no response other than ""we will call you when we find something out"". 
A full two days later is was told that they haven't even gotten to my vehicle! Being without a vehicle in a town with such poor public transit is a nightmare. Not to mention I was supposed to be moving three days after I dropped my vehicle off. Pretty hard to pack up and do last minute errands with out a car.
Would not recommend for recall service. ",1.3

57,"August 17, 2016","I purchased a pre-owned 2016 Ford Explorer from a dealership other that a Ford dealership because the car was exceptional and on the only one like it, at the time, in the Lubbock inventory base..  I needed to get a door factory computer code to program the keyless entry system.  I was told to bring the car our and they would program the new code in 10 minutes while i waited. I took the car to Gene Messer Ford that morning and they had it done in five minutes and I was ready to go before I could drink my complimentary coffee.  With the other Ford dealership in town, I was told I would have to bring the car in and leave it until sometime that afternoon and the cost would be $55.00. At Gene Messer Ford, they programed the car as free complement, that's right, free.. How many times have you had that  experience on a car that was bought elsewhere?  Gene Messer Ford has a very nice showroom and waiting area, and the people were efficient and pleasant.  Where do you think I will go to for my Ford service needs, as well as my next new car purchase? Based on my experience this morning, I would definitely offer a recommendation for Gene Messer Ford..",5.0

Ashley Roberson educated us and hunted down the vehicles that fit our needs. Exceptional patience, courteousness and customer service from this young lady. Fantastic work ethic and follow-through. The experience in the finance office, normally a hjtch in hades, was a pleasant, no-hassle experience- open, honest, and no pressure.",4.8
59,"June 09, 2016","How to describe this despicable experience briefly...... Everything was great until we filled out the credit apps. Once they had those, customer service was practically nonexistent. They had our info 4hrs with no phone all, after two phone calls was told the finance mgr was backed up. 6hrs later I finally receive a phonecall only to be told sorry, we couldn't get you financed with no explanation, no nothing. I know for a fact we had a 3% interest rate a year and a half ago, and I'm trading in a $45,000 truck. Needless to say, I will never step foot into gene messer ford in Lubbock Texas ever again, I will do my utmost to make sure no one I know ever darkens their door.

63,"February 13, 2016","I took my Ford in for service last week, was told that it would be 4 days before they could even look at it, so made an appointment to come back. Day of appointment they quickly diagnosed the issue and said my car would be ready that evening, that night I received a call that the car wasn't done, the 1 transmission guy was gone all afternoon, day 2, promised yet again car would be done, I don't hear anything all day, try to call and everything transfers to voicemail, of which all are full and can't leave a message, finally get a call, guess what, car isn't done again. Finally Saturday, promised car would be done first thing in the morning again about noon I call, can't get ahold of anyone, I finally about 2pm I drive down and told my car had just been finished, takes about 30 min to process the paperwork. Tried to charge me full price, asked if they could do anything and he knocked $15 bucks off a $450 service. Glad they took something off, but more of an insult considering that only brought the price down to what I was told it would cost.

I talked to a manager after all this mess and was promised what I would hear from the service  director, GM and himself on Monday. Guess who called??? Not a single person. It is clear that they do not value customers as I was not the only one who was experiencing this poor customer service as several other customers were expressing frustrations like mine in the waiting area.

I made an appointment for the truck to be looked at, when I called the day before to confirm, I was not on the books. They told me to bring it in anyway and they would get it looked at. Took it in and they still didn't know I was coming. Finally they said they would get it taken care of, but didn't look at it for 5 days. They said their was no issue even after I drove with the service rep and showed him the problem. He said he would talk to one of his service guys and get the new switch ordered. I call back after Christmas break and he still had no clue. The service manager was no help, they don't understand the benefits of their own extended warranty which I have and is supposed to provide me with a rental replacement.

67,"August 22, 2015","STEER CLEAR OF THIS ""BUSINESS""!

To simply state that this establishment exhibits poor customer service and lack of communication skills is a TERRIBLE understatement. I dropped my car off nearly a week and a half ago, and almost all efforts to communicate the repairs and status of my vehicle have been made by me. I really wanted to give this place a chance because it IS a Ford dealership and I was wanting the maintenance on my vehicle to be done professionally, but I REALLY regret my decision. I went against my better judgement, even after reading countless reviews and stories about how customers had been given the ""run around"" by their service personnel. First off, I dropped my vehicle off on Wednesday, July 29th, and was told by the person who received my vehicle (Nate), that they would be able to take a look at it the next day (Thursday) and assess the issues that I had brought forth to them. Three entire days went by and I received no word from Ford or their staff, so I finally decided to call them myself. After letting the phone ring several times, and being transferred to the proper department, I was greeted by Brent, who apparently felt the need to let me know that the gentleman who had received my vehicle and would be ""handling"" the repairs was no longer ""with them"". He then told me that they had tried to contact me, and that they had apparently gotten the wrong contact number. I know this is a lie because, being that I am not originally from Lubbock, when I give people my number I double check that the entire number is written down correctly, because my area code is not a local one. We spoke shortly and he then transferred me over to Angie, who had taken on the insurmountable task of dealing with my repairs. She was very nice, and we established that the number that I had given them was correct and that she would contact me at the earliest convenience and keep me in tune with all of the repairs on my vehicle. She also stated that my vehicle would be completely finished by Thursday, August 6th. I went to work today (Thursday, August 6th) thinking that I would finally be in my vehicle by day's end, and that my wife and I wouldn't have to deal with the hassle of sharing a single vehicle. Well, I was definitely wrong that time too. Over half of my entire workday went by, and I found myself having to once again call the Ford dealership and find out what the holdup was. I now spoke to Susan (keep in mind that this is now the fourth person to try and assist me with my repairs), who told me that my number had been called but that my phone was “disconnected”. I am currently in charge of a management team of about six managers, a staff of about thirty employees, and my supervisor has constant contact with me and seemingly they have no issue getting a hold of me, so for some reason her explanation didn’t really hold its ground. Needless to say, by now, I am more than frustrated. Not only that, but rather than assessing my vehicle and giving me a quote of all of its repairs all at once (because let’s be honest, they’ve had more than enough time to take the car apart and give me a COMPLETE assessment), the repairs just keep adding up and all of the sudden, my 2008 Ford Mustang has parts that they do not know if they can order or the specifics on when they can get them…  Not once have they apologized or tried to atone for their shortcomings. I am now left with an undefinable timetable for my repairs, and rest assured that they will not hesitate once when they give me my over two thousand dollar repair bill. Well I can certainly tell you this, as long as I live and reside in the Lubbock area, as long as I know people like myself that drive Fords or that even may want to purchase one, I will make it MY MISSION to steer them away from your dealership. This is flat out ridiculous, and I will let all social media outlets know what kind of business you people are running here in Lubbock. I am not looking for “hand outs” of any kind, the satisfaction alone of saving others from the amount of strife that you have caused my wife and I should be compensation enough.",1.0
68,"April 23, 2015","I received great customer service at this dearlship. The staff was kind and helpful. They fixed the issues wrong with my car in the service department . I had to wait a while but the waiting area was nice and clean, had comfy seating with a big screen and free coffee and sodas. I was also offered a ride home by staff three times which was also a very kind gesture . I would definatley recommend them . ",5.0
69,"April 09, 2015",I brought my pickup in for repairs they told me the fuel pump went out and they need to replace the fuel system due to metal contamination. I gave them my extended warranty paper work and told them to go ahead and get started. I would cover what ever I needed to. They sent me a quote and told me what the warranty would not cover. I double checked the parts prices with their parts department and they where 20 30 dollars cheaper than the service department prices. DO NOT GO TO GENE MESSER THEY ARE CROOKS IN THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT. and by the way it has taken them a week before they even ordered the parts. Who knows when I will get my pickup back. They did say they would fix the prices on the parts I guess I will find out when I get my truck back.,1.0
70,"December 29, 2014",The gm Jimmy Stallings would not address the issues that I was having with the service department and pawned me off with a finance manager.The service director chip woody was also too busy to address my issues. I have purchased over 10 vehicles from this dealership and I will not be buying anymore from these folks. ,1.0
