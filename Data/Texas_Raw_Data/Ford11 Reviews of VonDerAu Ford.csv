0,"March 12, 2020","I bought a 2020 Ford Explorer in Oct 2019.  At least once a week, the following sensors go off:
Pre-Collision Assist Not Available, Sensor Blocked
Front Camera Low Visibility Clean Screen
I have brought my car into Vonderau Ford in El Campo 3 times now with still no resolution.  I bought my car at BlueBonnet Ford in New Braunfels but they are 2.5 hours away from me so I cannot use their service dept.  I went by their service dept and they told me they would just replace the sensor.  So, I went to Vonderau and told them about the resolution.  I had an appointment with Vonderau today for them just to tell me they have to order the sensor.  Why didn't they order the sensor and then call me for an appointment to replace it.  I have been there 3 times now with nothing being accomplished.  I feel like I am getting the run-around. ",2.0

5,"February 17, 2020","Went in knowing what we were looking for and found it on the lot.  Wanted a white Edge Titanium with tan interior and it was there.  Andy was very helpful, got the car ready and had the paper ready as well.  Very good experience all the way around.",4.8

7,"December 10, 2019","Making a deal and purchasing a vehicle with VonDerAu Ford is an easy, laid-back experience.  All of our options were fully explained, as well as the features on the vehicle.  No high pressure sales pitch at all!  We are thoroughly enjoying our 2019 Ford Expedition Max.",5.0
8,"December 10, 2019","I am not an impulse buyer, I study things thoroughly before I make a purchase. I compared a 2020 Explorers Limited with the same options (MSRP, Invoice, TMV) from dealers online and VonDerAu beat those prices.  Mr. VonDerAu himself was involved in the dealings, one thing you can’t say for big town dealers. My overall experience was very satisfying dealing with the sales people, the finance department, and basically any VonDerAu Employee you met was friendly. ",5.0
