The service manager, Dan Wrider, always goes over and above to make sure that all is taken care of and that you are completely satisfied with all services performed. I’ve had my Mazda for 3 years and Gullo Mazda is the only place I’ve had it serviced.",5.0
1,"March 09, 2020",Paid cash for a new vehicle purchased In February 2020.  The sales manager was unprofessional and I have received zero assistance with my vehicle after the sale.  Don’t buy here!,1.0
2,"March 02, 2020",Went in for an inspection and the service manager told me that the windshield was tinted and would not pass. Then he said he would check with the technician. He did not come back until the car was failed for inspection. The service manager is a ride a**hole. ,1.0
3,"August 21, 2019","Not a good experience and didn’t seem trustworthy based on multiple interactions. I regret buying a car here. 

Tried to charge for window tinting which was already installed
Extreme low-ball on initial trade offer

Purchased a vehicle that needed a part replaced, which the dealer said they were certain would be done by a certain date. When that date rolled around, it was clear they had no idea where the needed part was; were clearly just saying things to get the sale done. This was highly inconvenient for me as a remote buyer.

Windshield was replaced as agreed, but remote start antenna not attached back on windshield properly

Car was delivered 800 miles away from it’s next service. Nickle-and-diming on a +$30K certified car.  

Car was to be delivered with a “full detail”. Interior surfaces weren’t completely wiped down. “Full detail” was a vacuum and quick wash. 

Took the vehicle to a local Mazda dealership shortly after delivery due to odd noises driving at highway speed; two tires were worn unevenly and needed an alignment. Not sure how Mazda certifies cars, but that’s very disappointing. 

I hope there are better Mazda dealerships out there as a first time owner of the brand.

4,"August 29, 2018","Not only did $10.00 worth of quarters get stolen last year from here out of my car, but this time they didnt tighten the lug nuts and I drove it over a week and my tire almost fell off. Mazda says they will give me a free measly service and Tire Rotation smh ...no thank you..I want to live...and WHERE IS THE EYE ROLL EMOJI??????  IM GONNA GIVE THEM SOMETHING TOO! ON ONLINE bad REVIEW!.....and....my back up alert has not worked since I took it in last time, they tried telling me I dont have it on my car so I had to pull out all the standard bells and whistles to prove I do! And they say it's a coinsidence that it stopped working when I was there last time. Then he says they dont even know how to work on that. Eye roll again,...its supposed to be a mazda tech working on it and they should know that stuff. So much incompetence. I have a 2016 mazda 3 grand touring.",2.0
5,"August 24, 2018","Requested synthetic oil change, however, it was service with conventional oil according to the invoice. Return the SUV to service to install synthetic oil. After a week of driving, I checked the oil and it was over filled by 1qt, check the invoice and saw where the technician had fill with 6 qts. instead of 5 qts. I will need to take off from work again to get this corrected. The service rep was courteous and helpful in correcting this error. 

If you take your vehicle in for service, check fluids before leaving the dealer service department. The service dept will need to earn my trust again before I can recommend this service center.",2.8

7,"March 18, 2018","We are SO GLAD we bought our Mazda 3 here ...  They HAVE NOT forgotten about us AFTER the Sale like most dealers.  They are FIRST CLASS in ALL Departments ...  Sales, Financing, and Service.  What we like is ...  They remember us BY NAME when we stop by without appointments.  Mazdas are the greatest cars for what you pay ... I see NO NEED to buy anything more expensive.  The sporty handling and ergonomics are Off the Charts !!! ",5.0

10,"August 21, 2017",I visited two other dealerships before calling Gullo Mazda.  They made the 80 Mike drive worth the effort.  Great price.  Stress free deal thanks to salesman David Rupp.,5.0
11,"June 10, 2017","We were offered a good deal on a 2016.5. My wife test drove the vehicle and there were several things she did not like . We were then offered to test drive the 2017. Which, addressed our concerns. Back in the office we commented that we would just wait until we could save and get the 2017 but was assured that the 2016.5 we were buying would have those features. Well it didn't and unfortunately my wife took delivery. Of course they completely denied ever making those statements. ",2.0
12,"June 09, 2017",Looking for a new car can be a very stressful experience for most people. I had driven my car for 10 years and had no idea where to even begin the search for a replacement. Gullo Mazda was my second stop. It was also my last stop. I found the perfect car for me and met some very nice people in the process. From sales (thank you Logan) to finance (thank you Jeff) the staff was professional but made the purchase of my new car actually fun. I would do it all over again and probably will. In a few years.,5.0
13,"June 07, 2017",Debbie from new car sales was wonderful! She really takes the time to treat her customers right and it shows. She was very responsive to all my questions and got me in and out of the dealership in a timely manner! I would recommended Debbie to anyone looking to buy a new Mazda at Gullo Mazda in Conroe.,5.0
14,"May 21, 2017","Most car dealerships are very pushy and just want a sale, however I was very impressed with the ease of browsing and test driving that I experienced. I would recommend buying from them and I highly recommend Debbie as your sales person! She is truly an asset very knowledgeable and kind. ",5.0

16,"April 02, 2017",The sales person was friendly and desirous of meeting my requirement of the car type/feature and price. Test drive and presentation on the car was well done. Overall it was a great experience.,4.8
17,"April 02, 2017","We have bought 4 cars from Logan Johnson in the last 3 years. 3 new Mazdas and 1 used Cadillac SRX. She is great to work with, and tries to help you to get the best deal possible. We feel she is very honest and caring,  and because of her we keep coming back to deal with Gullo Mazda. We are also very happy with the service dept. It is small, and the people that work there are very helpful.",5.0

19,"December 30, 2016",We walked in there minutes before closing time and were warmly welcomed .  The salespeople patiently showed us the vehicles. Debbie emailed more information the next day and arranged test drives. During the whole experience we never felt pressured but we were kept well informed. ,5.0
20,"December 01, 2016","Buyer BEWARE with this dealership.   Very unimpressed with the sales department specifically the sales manager. They did not seem very interested in selling a vehicle. The lack of communication between the sales person sales manager and the finance person was unnerving. I certainly hope the service department offers better service, but I am not holding my breath.",1.0
21,"October 13, 2016","Start with I have purchased and serviced many vehicles over the years.
Drove my sons car in for some lingering issues it's been having for some time! 
1st visits ever here at Gullo Service dept
Greated by Nicolette Dixon upon arrival 
She listened to my concerns and issues at hand. Immediately pulled car into service bay and had me on the road in under an hour.

22,"May 06, 2016","My husband and I literally enjoyed buying a vehicle at Gullo Mazda. That's mainly because our salesman, Rick Tygret, was so helpful and easy to work with. He was committed to getting us the tight car at the right price, from the moment we stepped onto the lot. He didn't play typical salesmen games (or try any Jedi mind tricks) to manipulate us into buying what HE wanted to sell, as opposed to what we wanted to buy. Instead, he listened with focus, cared about our needs, and zeroed-in on the perfect fit for our family. Rick also didn't let a couple of minor obstacles related to our budget become a source of setback in his commitment to getting us the right deal. He stayed the course, remained pleasant the entire time, and delivered for us. He communicated well with Jared (the Sales Manager) and Kirk (the Finance Director), both of whom were also very kind and a pleasure to work with, and together they got us the deal we were looking for on the vehicle we wanted.  We will definitely continue to do business with Rick Tygret and the Gullo Mazda Team. ",5.0
23,"April 29, 2016",I went in to have a screw taken out of one of my tires and see about doing my first oil change.  David Williams explained everything to me and got my car in and out.  The staff even asked if wanted water and took good care of us while we waited for our car to be done.  Will definitely come back to have my car serviced here again.,5.0
24,"April 27, 2016","I went in for my Mazda 3's 10,000 mile servicing and it was done in a timely manner, approximately the allotted time which David Williams told me it would take.  I have no complaints; all the work, including software updates, was done.",4.0
25,"February 23, 2016","My daughter is good at loosing things -- like the second key for ""my"" Mazda 3 that she drives.  After several months of looking for it in every corner of her room, I decided to purchase a fob from a reputable locksmith, and bring it in to Gullo for programming.  Nicolette Dixon greeted ne the second I drove up ,,, I explained to her what I needed done, that I had talked to the Service Manager & knew the programming charge ,,,, off she went.  After a few minutes, she returned with the BAD NEWS ,,, the key I had purchased would not program.  Thankfully, Gullo Mazda had one in stock & went to work cutting the interior piece (that never gets used) & programing the fob.  I got on a business conference call, using a stack of covered tires as my desk ,,, when the call was done, the key was programmed AND the car was washed (my daughter thinks the only water that hits her car is rain).  SUPER service ,,, and we no longer have to have the Mazda 3 towed if/when she looses the key !!  (PS: the locksmith refunded the purchase ,,,, ""sometimes"" we get a key that cannot be programmed) ,,,, ""stick with dealer parts"" is my lesson on that one.  Thanks, Nicolette for your kind handling of an irritating situation.",4.8
26,"February 09, 2016",We had an appointment for an emission control recall. We also got the oil changed and tires rotated. David Williams met us after we drove up and knew the work we needed done.

39,"September 10, 2015","I entered the dealership with a price in mind to find a used 2014+ Mazda 6. I had an offer from my bank to get a car loan which is how I decided my cap price. My bank has always been great to me and offered stellar rates for my age and credit history (or lack thereof). Mr. Eric Holladay searched the lot and database looking for the car I had in mind to no avail. He suggested he may be able to get a better rate for me if I was interested in buying a new vehicle. Skeptical, but with nothing to lose I replied that ""he could try"". He was able to get me IN HOUSE financed for half the rate my bank offered. This was the first time anyone has beat an offer from my normal organization. I am now a proud owner of a 2016 Mazda 6 Sport and could not be happier with the purchase. The vehicle drives like a dream and has a modern, slick interior that has not failed to thoroughly impress anyone I have showed her off to. 
P.S. Eric, I named her Trixie after the show Speed Racer. Thanks again and I'll say hi when I stop in for my first scheduled maintenance!",5.0

David greeted me promptly and professionally.  He shared how long it would take to have my vehicle serviced and asked me if that would be ok?

50,"May 30, 2015","I checked price and availability at three dealerships in the Houston area for a new 2016 Mazda6.  The best quote, by far, was from Eric at Gullo Mazda in Conroe.  I was a bit skeptical since the deal offered was so much better than from the other dealers.  Eric arranged to have the car at the dealership (he personally went to another dealer in Houston and drove the Mazda6 to Gullo). When I arrived at Gullo, for the first time, the car was washed, ready and beautiful.  Eric came through with the exact car I wanted and honored the quote he had offered with no games or pressure for additional add-ons.  I have bought many cars over the years, this rates as one of the top buying experiences ever.",5.0

53,"May 07, 2015","I bought my new Mazda 3 Touring Hatchback from Logan Johnson early this year and was very pleased. Logan tasked me to be sure to make an appointment and return for maintenance.
Recently,  I noticed that it was time for an oil change and tire rotation.  I called Gullo Mazda and spoke to the service advisor Justin Smithey, he was pleasant and efficient.  I was able to make an appointment for an oil change and tire rotation, plus I had seen the tire pressure light come on so I asked to have that checked out also.  I requested the earliest possible time because I had other appointments that day.  Dealerships are known for being very messy and chaotic on the service drive but not Gullo Mazda, Justin Smithey was ready for me and they got started right away. I waited in the service waiting area which was sparkling clean and comfortable.  They have a great coffee machine that makes a great cup of  coffee just the way I like it.  They offer WiFi so I was able to catch up on email and in less than 45 minutes Justin returned and my car was ready.  I got exactly what I needed with no chaos.  That's what I  wanted and Gullo Mazda delivered again.
If you want simple straight forward great vehicle maintenance service call and ask for Justin  Smithey you will enjoy the experience.
