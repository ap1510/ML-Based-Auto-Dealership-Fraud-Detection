1,"March 11, 2017","2nd vehicle we've purchased from this dealership.  Cullen Haley was outstanding.  Thank you Mark Damm for taking the time to walk my daughter through the economics of buying and selling a vehicle.  Very pleased with the quick in-and-out service and taking care of everything, from choosing the car, to test driving it, to paying for it, to taking final delivery of the vehicle after it has been detailed (and with a full tank of gas).  Excellent place all around!  I will be back for my third vehicle, but luckily my son is only 11 at this point!  Octavio",5.0
2,"November 15, 2016","I purchased a used truck and Cullen Haley was excellent to work with.  Very knowledgeable, friendly and professional.  He was focused on my needs 100% and very courteous to my entire family.  The truck developed a vibration problem shortly after I took possession so I took it back.  Angel Montemayor (Service Manager) took it in the shop and persisted in finding the problem and fixed it... REPLACED ALL FOUR RIMS!... problem solved, no charge!  He also went the extra mile and detailed the truck again before delivering it.  Also, they allowed me to borrow one of those cool little Fiats while they had my truck for a few days.  All in all, very impressed.  I will be back to purchase a vehicle for my daughter.  I feel I do not need to go anywhere else for my family's vehicle needs.  They are the best and will take care of you. Awesome people, awesome service!",4.8
3,"August 28, 2013","Our experience at Alan Samuels fiat was very positive. All of the employees we dealt with throughout the day were professional and courteous. There was no pressure to buy something we didn't want or any sort of strong handed "" steering"" of our decision. We came in with an idea of what we wanted and left with a car that made us happy. Everyone from our salesman to the finance manager presented themselves as courteous and pleasant. We would definitely do business with them again in the future. Thanks guys :)",4.8

5,"January 19, 2013","I was really impressed with Gustavo's knowledge and the way he handled the sale. I first started working with him last June. He was patient and followed up without pressure.  I had looked at other brands at your dealership and any time I called him, he would bring over a car immediately. What great service! ",5.0
6,"October 22, 2012","Had did everything over the internet, which was so simple and easy. Upon arrival of picking up my car, it was dirty inside and out after just getting washed. When you buy a brand new car, you expect it to be show room ready. Marcus helped in making the situation better, and Cyndi made sure it was ready the next day. Kuddos to everyone for being so nice.",4.3
7,"October 16, 2012","I spoke with Orlando over the phone and he was very informative.  When I went to the dealership, I met him and he turned me over to DJ, whom took care of showing me the vehicles, etc.  DJ was an absolute jewel to work with - knowledgeable, pleasant, polite and made the entire selection a fun experience.  Once the selection was made, then Leslie took care of us for the financing.  Again, knowledgeable, pleasant, polite and made it a fun experience.

I have purchased several cars over the years and this was by and far the most enjoyable experience I have ever had at any dealership.  They were ALL wonderful!!!",5.0
