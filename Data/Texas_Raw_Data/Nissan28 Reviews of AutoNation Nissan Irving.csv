1,"November 16, 2017",In 18 years of buying vehicles this dealership has to be the worse. The customer service is awful. The sales girl hung up on us. Took us almost 2 weeks to get our vehicle shipped to us. Once received the transport driver did not pick up the trade in and when I called the dealership still hadn't paid off my trade in load. We were missing head phones and the remote to the tv. I would never recommend this dealership. ,1.0
2,"July 23, 2017","Zero customer service skills. 
Rude sales managers.
Horrible communication. 
Was given the ""Run-A-Round"". 
I'm not sure how salesmen can treat customers this way and still have a job in customer service.

3,"June 04, 2017","Would not recommend this dealership - very distasteful sales strategies including bait and switch on sales pricing, lies about rebates and interest amounts, and classless comments about your trade-in.
1.	Bait and switch – the listing for the 2017 Nissan Rogue we recently purchased was $23,500 (after rebates). When we were shown the vehicle, again, the sales woman indicated the price of the vehicle to be $23,500. Once the offer was presented, the vehicle was now $24,500 due to a mandatory $999 Texas Protection Package that was already ‘part of the vehicle’ per the sales manager. This practice is complete bait and switch. We refused to pay for this, but the sales manager stated it was part of the vehicle and a mandatory part of the price. 
2.	The sales manager lied to us about the rebate deadline. The sales manager informed us that the rebates being offered expired at midnight that day(May 31st). The reality was that the rebates being offered did not expire at midnight, but were instead available thru June 5th.
3.	The sales manager lied to us about the interest we would be paying on the vehicle. The sales manager informed us that over the first 6-months of the loan, we would ‘only pay a couple hundred dollars in interest.’ The facts of the matter, we are scheduled to pay $500+ in interest over the first 6-months of the loan (4.5% interest rate despite excellent credit).
4.	We inquired several times for the interest vs. principal breakdown of our monthly payments (essentially an amortization table). We were passed from the sales woman we were working with to two other individuals who would not provide the breakdown, and eventually passed to the sales manager who would also not provide this detail (instead, simply stating that we would ‘only pay a couple hundred dollars of interest’ over the first 6-months’). At no point would they provide specifics beyond 5-year total interest at the very end of a very long process.
5.	Upon trading in our vehicle, the sales manager told us we were lucky to be getting $1,000 in trade-in value. He stated ‘your car is junk with over 200,000 miles. It will go straight to our dump the second you walk out of here.’ This was simply a classless comment. Also quite interesting given less than 4-days later our vehicle was listed on their website for nearly $3,000.

9,"March 20, 2016","WORST PLACE EVER!!!! MOST EXPENSIVE OIL CHANGE EVER! REVIEW ON SERVICE AND PETER HALEY!!!!! 

I wanted to take my Nissian Altima to a Nissian dealership just to make sure everything was up to standards with my car (per car maker). I only needed to get an oil change. (Luckily) I sat in the customer service waiting area for 3 hours for them to complete the service that only was supposed to take approx. 1 hour. Mind you there were only 2 customers waiting as well. After being frustrated for sitting there all this time I leave. I get in my car and everything seemed fine. So later I noticed that where the oil change sticker was placed was a big, dirty, and oily finger print under my tint. Honestly, I thought I was seeing things but after pulling over and really looking all I could think was xxx! And what makes it worst they tried to fix it by just pushing the tint back up with all kind of air pockets and wrinkles.

So I called the dealership only to listen to the ringing and not an actual voice. So I continue to call for about 20 minutes before I finally get someone to answer the phone. I explained my situation to her and the lady I spoke to didn't know what to tell me. So I informed her that I was on my way to speak in person to the manager about this problem.  So I get there and get out of my car and walk in the cashier area and wait. There were two ladies at the window and only one person was with a customer. NO ONE SAID HI I'LL BE WITH YOU IN A MOMENT!!! WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE. So after the girl finishes scanning in the work orders she then says “how can I help you?” So I explained once again about why I was there. So she went to get someone......as I'm watching my car this guy walks up to my car and opens my door. So I walk out there to see if he needed to see what the problem was. He said Oh Is This Your Car? I said yes and he walked off.  At this point I'm sitting in my car waiting for the girl who is standing here talking to another lady about why I'm here. She walks up to my car and says as soon as he (the guy that just walked off) is finished with this other customer he will be over here to talk to you. This was the service man who originally did my oil change.  So I turn and look to see what customer was here before me according to the young lady, she was talking about a TOW TRUCK THAT PULLED UP AFTER ME!!! So I told her NO HE WAS HERE AFTER ME AND I DON'T APPRECIATE BEING PUSHED TO THE SIDE LIKE MY TIME ISN'T PRECIOUS. She walked over to him and told him to come talk to me.

So the service man walks over there and leans in my car and says ""Umm what’s the problem?"" I said exactly what you are already rubbing on my eyebrow tint. ""Do you really think we did this because it looks like this has been done a while ago?"" At this point I was much disrespected because he was calling me a liar. I told him I have gone to Westway Ford for every oil change since I got this car and the FIRST TIME I come HERE you cost me more than the cost of an oil change (the reason I came here). He then said ""well when you want to bring the car?"" I told him Friday Morning. SURE THING

So Friday morning gets here, I call to verify I would not be there all day with this. The man told me the tinter doesn't get there until 7:30 am. I get to the dealership to find NO TINTER. I waited 15 minutes for him to come tell me the tinter wasn't there. Then he said he would be up here by 11:00 am. So 11:00 comes and again no TINTER. So the service man asked for my phone number and said he would call me when he got there. So 2:00 pm comes and still no phone call. So I called up there and he said ""Oh he just got here"" after telling me originally the tinter guy gets here at 7:30 every day. CUSTOMER SERVICE AT IT'S FINEST AGAIN RIGHT?! NO

So then the service man and the mechanic told me to take my toll tag off while they sit over there talking about how they don't think this could happen from just doing an oil change. So I told them I COULDN'T AGREE MORE!!! I was more frustrated because I felt like they were only concerned about accusing me of doing this and not accepting their mistake. I told them I have proof that this wasn't done prior to me coming to this dealership with the photos in my phone. I was very heated. 

After wasting my whole day dealing with this I get my car back and my tint is not the same as the way it was prior to coming in to this place. I left crying because I was so frustrated with this dealership and the POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE, QUALITY OF SERVICE, LACK OF RESPONSIBILITY, AND EVERYTHING ELSE THATS WRONG WITH THIS PLACE. 

I WILL NEVER RETURN TO AUTONATION NISSIAN FOR NOTHING. I WOULDN'T CARE IF THEY WERE THE LAST PLACE STANDING I WOULD NOT TAKE MY CAR THERE. EVERYONE I COME ACROSS THAT I WILL TELL ABOUT MY EXPERIENCE HERE AND NEVER REFER ANY ONE TO THERE DEALERSHIP. 

I NEVER THOUGHT AN OIL CHANGE WOULD COST ME MORE THAN THE COST OF 3 OIL CHANGES TOTAL. TIME MISSED FROM WORK, RE-DOING WHAT WAS NOT DONE CORRECTLY.

10,"December 29, 2015","I had to visit this xxxx as the dealer that I visited earlier didn't had the color I wanted. I been promised over email that they do a price match as only color varies. But upon arriving, they started the game plan. They started saying that they can't match that price but will try their best to what they can. Since I liked the color, I nodded, that's the worst thing I did. The play continued as the sales man went and forth 8 times and finally after 3 hours told we can match the price but pay us 500$ extra since they did lot work to match my interested color. Again without knowing the trick, I nodded. Then asked for my credit application and submitted. Second round of play started saying if financing only(if the rate is more than 2.5% only) they can agree to the price match else if with cash, the deal would go $2500 more. And they started harassing me one after the other when I started saying that I am leaving. 

Don't ever think of visiting this xxxx again. My recommendation to Nissan is to remove dealership with this bloody dealers and save innocent people from falling to this trap.",1.0

12,"March 23, 2015",NEVER BUY A CAR FROM ANY OF THE AUTO NATION DEALERSHIP ESPECIALLY AUTO NATION NISSAN OF IRVING TEXAS IT'S BEEN ALMOST 3 WEEKS AND THEY STILL HAVEN'T RETURNED MY MONEY THAT THEY TOOK FROM MY ACCOUNT...  I'VE EVEN CONTACTED THE CEO MIKE JACKSON AND HE HASN'T EVEN DONE ANYTHING ABOUT HIS DEALERSHIP TAKING MY MONEY AND NOT RETURNING IT...  THAT'S SAD EVEN IF THE CEO WON'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT...  THIS FRIDAY WILL BE 3 WEEKS SINCE THEY TOOK THE MONEY FROM MY ACCOUNT AND STILL HAVEN'T RETURNED IT TO ME... ,1.0
13,"November 22, 2014","Whats interesting is that the experience was fine with the sales people. Its the General Manager of all folks who was insulting to his customers, raising his voice, and showed absolutely no respect for his business or the brand. Marshall Hampton introduced himself as the GM of the dealership towards the end of our visit. We received a call from one of their sales reps expressing that they would by far exceed a trade-in value for our existing car if we come in to talk to them about leasing. 

Well the initial offer was a low ball offer (because we'd already shopped the car around to other dealers and the offer was $1K less than any other dealer offered us) The MSRP was also way higher on the car we were interested in buying than other dealerships for the same vehicle. They spent hours talking our ears off about dealer incentives, options, and gimmics. All of this is status quo with car salesmen, but you should never expect this from a GM. 

Not only did the GM indicate verbally that he ""May not interested interested in having us as customers if we continue to shop around"" but he became beligerent, insulting, and at one point my fiance felt unsafe physically.

14,"February 03, 2014","I am beyond disappointed with my entire experience with this dealership. I found the 2 cars I was looking for and had cash in my pocket to spend. I called ahead and the dealership confirmed that 1 vehicle had been sold but was told the 2nd vehicle was on the lot. I gave them my name and phone number and stated I would be there shortly. Approximately 35 miles later I arrived. The salesman was courteous and gave my 4 yo and myself a ride around to the back of the lot where the vehicle was located..and then a ride to the carwash area..and then to the garage..and finally back to the office to look it up (Did I mention it was 34º?!). After 10 or so minutes he returned to tell me it was not on their lot per the manager. I was amazed that the manager wouldnt tell me himself or try to explain so I asked to see him. The salesman casually pointed to the managers office and stated ""he is in there."" I entered the office and was hardly greeted.  He remained seated and I was interrupted by 2 phones calls on his personal cellphone. He stated there was no vehicle like that on his lot and he wasnt sure what the deal was, with no explanation. I left with no answers or care that my business was lost. 70 miles round trip.

 Im not a ""review writer"" or letter writer but this was unacceptable to me. Their lack of knowledge and lackadaisical attitude will definitely keep me, my family, and friends away from any and all Autonation dealerships.",1.8
15,"August 23, 2013","I bought my car about 4 months ago and I just had to replace two tires because they were completely bald. I told them this and they said nothing they could do on their end. This should have been seen/tires should have been replaced before they sold it to me. The guy was rude and said I can't do anything about it, it's all on you. 

DONT BUY USED FROM THEM! It is obvious they do not check everything before they sell it. And they are no help at all! I would never recommend them to anyone, terrible dealership!!!!!!!",2.0
16,"May 06, 2013","These guys were great!  I stopped in doing research on my next car, and once I had made my decision, they made it VERY easy.  We traded emails during the day, while I was in school and Brad answered them quickly and efficiently.  Even though they didnt have the car I wanted in stock, he went ahead and got one, got all the accessories I wanted on it (and installed) prior to me even going back to the dealership!  Typically, that doesnt happen with some sort of committment from the customer, but, our open communications via email squared that away.  Delivery day was very smooth!

Thanks, guys!!",5.0
17,"January 01, 2013","Quite simply, the best experience I've had buying a new vehicle. The internet sales manager Peter Tramby was a joy to work with. The dealership did not have the Pro-4X Xterra I wanted and Peter searched and found it and got it there for me. I was also impressed by how they handled the pricing. Everything was up front, no hidden agendas. In fact, the pricing was concluded on-line before Peter and I even spoke. Would recommend Peter and this dealership highly.",5.0

20,"April 14, 2012","Although I did not end up purchasing a vehicle with the dealership I had a very good interaction over email with Peter Tramby.  He was courteous (not pushy), and willing to go the extra mile, even offering to have a car I was interested in delivered to the dealership from another Bankston, just so I could check it out. My confidence in Peter as a salesman who is interested in doing right by his customers was solidified when I let him know we had made a purshase elsewhere (we opted for a different make of vehicle): he expressed well wishes for us in our new car--rather than regret over a lost sale.  I will definitely consider Bankston Nissan and Peter Tramby for future car buying.",5.0
21,"February 27, 2012","I was in the market for a new car for two weeks and had been to several car dealerships only to get the ""dealer games"" played on me.  I was about to stop looking when my wife talked me into looking at Bankston Irving.  I looked online and asked for a quote and within 15 minutes received a personal email from Peter Tramby.  We exchanged emails and EVERY time I sent an email, he ALWAYS responded and answered my questions quickly and professionally.  I set an appointment to go in on a Friday, went in and Peter was with a customer that ran long.  He took a minute, came out, explained what was going on and let Aaron Komar help me.  Aaron was AMAZING! Very professional, was not pushy or did the hard, high pressure sell.  I told him what I wanted, he went out, pulled the car, we took it for a test drive and we started working through the paperwork and I took the car home a couple hours later.  There was only 1 finance guy working at the time while we were there, so it slowed things down a little, but while we were waiting, Peter and Aaron constantly kept us company, asked if we needed anything, made sure we were comfortable and NEVER tried to come back and pressure us into anything we already said no to.  They were amazing. I'll go back and deal with these guys again!",5.0
22,"November 13, 2011","This was the first time we purchased a vehicle from an internet salesperson.  From the moment we made contact, Peter Tramby made the experience a positive one. Every question was answered and explained without hesitation.  He was thorough in his explanations of options available and made sure that we were happy with our choices.  Everyone that we came in contact with at the dealership, couldn't have been nicer or more accommodating.  That included the Sales Manager, Receptionist, other Sales Staff and especially the Finance person.  I would definitely refer friends and co-workers to Bankston Irving.",5.0
23,"October 25, 2011","We were recently in the market for a new vehicle.  After a lot of research we decided on purchasing a Kia Sportage and thus visited several Kia dealers in our area.  Some of the dealers we worked with were pushy and others were pleasant, but none of the local dealers were willing to go the extra mile to find what we really wanted in a car.  After quite a bit of internet research we came across Bankston Nissan of Irving and read reviews from purchasers about their experience with the staff there.  Through those reviews we felt that Peter Tramby was the guy to deal with.  He had some of the best reviews that I have ever seen and we thought he would be both attentive to our needs and professional in his dealings with us.  

Honesty and complete disclosure were very important to us as we were from out of state and would have to rely on our dealer to answer our questions truthfully.  I called Bankston and specifically asked to work with Peter.  Peter far exceeded anything that we could have hoped for in an honest and trustworthy car dealer.  He promptly returned all phone calls, answered any and all questions that we had fully and candidly.  We feel Peter went far above and beyond what any car dealer would have done.  

We could not have been more pleased both with our purchase and our experience with Peter Tramby and those of Banskton Nissan of Irving.  I would recommend that anyone looking for a vehicle check out Bankston’s website, give Peter a call and see for yourself that honesty and integrity are not yet dead in the car industry!  A huge thanks to Peter Tramby and all those at Bankston that helped to make the purchase of our car exactly the experience we were hoping for!

24,"March 30, 2009",I purchased a new 2009 Altima from Internet Sales Manager Peter Tramby. My experience with Peter was outstanding. He was very helpful and willing to look into any questions I had. I would definitely purchase another vehicle from Peter Tramby. My overall experience at this dealership was very good.,5.0
25,"July 28, 2008","My husband and I bought a car from Bankston Nissan of Irving a few days ago.  Our service we received (from the salesmen and the finance manager) was oustanding.  They really worked with us to get deal we could both agree on.  My husband had negative equity with his trade-in but they really worked hard to help us get the car we wanted with payments we could afford.  I originally met with Peter but when I got there, he was with another customer so Angel helped us get the car we wanted.  Once Peter was done, he took over and helped us with all our needs.  I know this sounds strange, but he seemed so sincere and to be honest, I'm sure Angel got the commission but he still went above and beyond to make sure we were satisfied.  He gave us his personal cell phone# and stayed an hour after the dealership closed to make sure we knew everything about the car.  I've never felt so secure with a car dealership as I felt with this one (thanks to Peter).  The finance mgr (Steve Lewis) was very helpful and seemed to look for our best interests in our final purchase.  On a side note, we noticed little (VERY LITTLE) scratches on the trunk the next day and they had us bring it in and removed them within 10 minutes!  I had just settled down in the waiting room with my kids and they were done!  That is oustanding since most dealerships are done with you as soon as you sign the paperwork.

I have another rating for Bankston Nissan in Lewisville as this is where we purchased our 1st Nissan, and I have another for North Texas Nissan (DO NOT GO TO THEM!).


* I gave this dealer a 4 in Customer Service and Friendliness because the receptionist didn't even smile or offer help.  She has to be approached rather than offering help.  But the sales team and managers had great attitudes.",4.6

27,"October 07, 2005","I went in looking for a cheap used car, but walked out (of course) in a new 2005 Sentra. I was taken, but didn't mind. I am pregnant and needed a good, reliable car really quickly but didn't think that I could get financing for a new one. George just added $100 over invoice and we signed for the car a few hours later. I wish they would have had a selection of cars for me to choose from, but they didn't. I got the ""last"" basic model they had, which was fine, but buying a new car is a big deal and it would have been nice to at least have some choice. Everyone has been very nice and even inspected the car seat for me today without much wait.",4.4
