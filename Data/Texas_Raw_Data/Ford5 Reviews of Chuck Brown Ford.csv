I was fortunate to work directly with Mr Brown, who was a staright shooter. He was fair and honest. It was a simple, low stress purchase. Everyone was very nice and helpful!  I would highly recommend this dealership. ",5.0

3,"March 20, 2013","Bought a used F150 that was listed on Auto trader. Tommy was great, honest, and described the truck perfectly. I drove 4 hours to the dealership and the truck was exactly as described. On the drive home I noticed the tilt wheel lever was broken. I faxed tommy the invoice where I had it repaired and he reimbursed me promptly. Can't ask for a better experience.",4.8
