0,"May 14, 2020","Rodney Feltus at Joe Myers Toyota was fantastic to work with. He was personable, listened well, and proved himself to be extremely knowledgeable. After our ordered-from-factory car arrived, Rodney gave my wife and I what's *easily* the most thorough tour of a new, high-tech car with we've ever gotten. His tour was *way* better than the standard ""Here's the keys, now get out of here"" some dealers seem to do.

Part of the reason we chose Joe Myers is because Rodney was the only sales rep among several dealerships we talked to, who was willing to give us a *proper* number on what the 'drive off' price would be for a factory-ordered car. Every other dealership we talked to essentially refused to put any price in writing- asking us to put money down for an order, then negotiate a price *after* arrival. No thanks!

Aside from the care and attention we were given *before* our purchase, Rodney got in contact a while after our purchase to check how we were doing with our new purchase (we *love* it!).

Another nice *very* note- I needed a dealer signature on a form in order to get a Texas rebate for my new car. I contacted Rodney about it, emailed him a document to print and sign- and that was it- an envelope with the printed and signed documents arrived at my house a week later, with no need for extra reminders.

I *really* appreciate that level of care being shown after the original transaction was complete, and would *definitely* recommend this place (and especially our sales person, Rodney) to others!",5.0
1,"January 05, 2020","Hey Joe Myers Toyota I came to your dealership on Saturday December 21 and wanted to test drive a Tacoma Pro. You declined my request and offered me to drive a different trim level. I stated to your sales guy that’s not what I wanted. 

As I promised you I took my business down the road to Don McGill Toyota. Today I drove out with a sweet 2019 Tacoma Pro. Thank you Victor with Don McGill!!",1.0
2,"December 06, 2019","First of all I have bought 2 new 4 runners in the past from the new car sales and the service was excellent, I wanted to buy a used 2019 corolla for my son, I live out of town so I looked on their web site and seen one that I like, I called up a salesman by the name of Ruben over the phone and asked him if the deal was real that I seen on their web site. He told me that the price was good and he made me an appointment to come and look at the car and he said he would be the salesman that I would deal with. I went to the appointment on Black Friday and when I got there and asked for him, they said he was not in and they sent me another salesman, I did not get the deal as I was promised and I got tired of haggling with them because I had drove a long way with my son and he liked the car. I paid a much higher price than the car was listed for and later I found out that Ruben the salesman that I talked to over the phone was there, they added more additional charges on the car that I did not notice until I got home. I ended up paying approximately $1500.00 more that what it was listed for. I must say that the used car sales team do not have any integrity and they just play games, I will not buy another car from them. The new car sales team are good. The car had bird poop all over it and they would not wash it, I had to drive it home like that.",1.0

113,"October 09, 2018","AVOID SERVICE DEPARTMENT! I want to make it very clear that my review is about the service department, NOT THE SALES DEPARTMENT!
Bought a new car there about 6 months ago. It now has 10K miles and plenty of tread on the tire. Ran over a nail and took it to Joe Myers Service with nail in tire. Went and waited at a table which allowed me to see my vehicle in the service bay. A few guys took the tire of, looked at it and put the tire aside. 45 minutes later, nobody touched or looked at my tire. After my 4 children nearly destroyed the kids area and drove everyone in the waiting area insane, 45 minutes later, I went and looked for my service advisor. He was not there and someone said he was at lunch. I told a cashier that nobody had touched my tire in 45 minutes and she said she would get a manager. A manager walks by me 5 minutes later and looks at the tire and chats with 2 guys in the service bay. He returns and looks around like a lost puppy dog. I got his attention and said that he was most likely looking for me. He tells me that the service advisor went to lunch (Lunch at 3:30pm?) and didn't communicate with anyone like he should have. Then he tells me I need a new tire, assuming I am some idiot that fell off the turnip truck last night. Well, I called his bluff after cursing him gently for the horrible service I received (which is why I always avoided this service department for years. I live 2 miles away from it and I typically drive to Katy, ten miles away for service to avoid this place. I didn't have the luxury of doing that with a nail in a tire and 4 children in then car...not safe). I asked him to put the spare on and get my car pulled around asap. That was the only thing they did right. Took my car to Don McGill Toyota this morning at 9am and was out of there with a plug in the damaged tire at NO CHARGE in 30 minutes. They took the time to explain that it was not bad at all and wasn't even close to needing a new tire. I didn't even tell them about the previous day I spent at Joe Myers Service, but they explained this as a courtesy. Drove out of there with $300 buck in my pocket that Joe Myers Service tried to scam me out of, but I will never get that hour of my life back I could have spent with my children doing something fun. So, for that, Joe Myers Service will NEVER see me again. I'd rather pay $$ to have my car towed so I can avoid these scam artists that have an absolute lack of urgency and care for their customers. Joe Myers Service = Poor Service and probably a waste of money you could save elsewhere where people have higher ethical and moral standards. ",1.0

160,"April 12, 2018","First off, the salesman Abdul N. was friendly when showing you around. Then he start playing games like pretending to run back and forth between me and his management team over a reasonable price. He promise to offer a $100 referral bonus if I persuade my partner to buy the truck. Anyway after we reach an agreeable price, he make you sign a ""sell as is"" document. This document is a scam because in the time we sit in the office and negociate prices and financial plan with the finance department, he (the salesman) go outside and start figuring what he can steal from your vehicle like the new carpet and all the perks of buying a new car from a dealer. When we finish our financial payment plan and drive off the dealer, we are dead tired and didn't bother paying attention to what was stolen. We only figure what was stolen and missing the day after. He never give us the $100 referral bonus he'd promised too. When I inquired him about it, he said to leave my mail address and the customer service team will send me the $100 check. I never receive it. All in, He scam me the $100 referral bonus he'd promised and a set of new Tacoma carpet which I don't know the value of. Also maybe other dealer gifts and perks that I don't know about since he is in control of what he is giving out. Second, never ever trust a financial manager under any circumstances was the hard lesson I learned from this dealership. I knew since ages ago to never trust a financial manager at any dealership, but this time I was introduce to a fellow Vietnamese by the name of Nhan Le. My partner and I trusted him so much because he is a fellow Viet, the kind of trust that some people do when they meet someone from their culture or heritage. We trust him so much we agree to whatever payment plan he recommend. The biggest scam from this dealership is when Nhan Le recommend us to buy the Mechanic Protection Plan. We immediately reject the idea but Mr. Le said ""that we can try it out for 30 days and after 30 days we can cancel it for a full refund."" He insist we try it out since it cost us nothing if we cancel it. We agreed and fell into the finance department's trap. We took the time to go to this dealership during Lunar New Year Celebration just to cancel the Mechanical Protection Plans on time in hope to get a full refund like Mr. Le suggested. We submit to him the filled and signed cancellation documents hoping everything is in good hand. Mr. Le never submit our cancellation documents. After a few months and I have no evidence of refund for the Mechanical Protection Plan, I got worry and call Mr. Le's office many time. He never pick up his phone, not even once even when I leave multiple recorded message to request a call from him. I call The MPP headquarter and a customer rep said they never receive any cancellation document for my plan. She said she can help me start a cancellation process but it has to be based on the current month. I finish the process with her. Over the next few days I try to call Mr.Le to get some answer from him but all my calls ignored. I call the dealership front desk and have them set me up with a random financial manager in hope to catch Mr. Le who's avoiding me. First I got a guy name Victor who said he can't help me. Then I got another guy name Mark who claimed he is Mr Le's supervisor and that I should give him a days to investigate the matter. He promised (haha I know) he'd call me back early the next day to resolve my situation. I never got his call. The refund from MPP cancellation came and we lost $1.5k. Nice colluding work Finance Department. Ya'll deserve a nice big bonus from Mr. Myer at the end of the year for sure, but will you live long and healthy enough till the end of the year to get that bonus? Karma will prevail (I am not threatening). My complaint will not end here. I have file complaints with the BBB and State Attorney. You will hear my voice for sure.",1.4

216,"May 28, 2015","Thanks to Alex Wier, who I dealt with over email to set up the deal on our camry.  He was straight forward and gave me a reasonable price.   I contacted several dealerships one evening and got all offers before lunch the next day.  Alex's offer was the lowest so I contacted him by phone and planned to pick it up that evening.  Alex was feeling under the weather so informed me that his partner Roland Charles would complete the deal when we arrived. 

Roland Charles was the right man for the job.  He had the Camry setting at the front of the store gassed up and ready to go.  There was no ""let me find the keys,"" or  "" I have to go get a paper plate,"" or ""let me have it gassed up"" He introduced himself, opened the car, showed us the selling point, which he knew well.  He was ready to go at the moment we arrived, and we really appreciated it.  He said that he had picked the best one out for us that was what we asked for.  

We test drove and he was quiet, except when asked.  He knew every control and any car question that I asked.  He simply let us drive a few miles on the highway, and let us listen to the car.  It really was a great test drive.

The longest amount of time, about 45 minutes, was waiting for finance. JUST sitting and waiting...

The finance guy did his usual song and dance, even though we informed him up front that we were not interested in any extended warrantees or prepaid maintenance.   It was not horrible, but he was much pushier than the Honda finance guy that we bought an Accord from three weeks ago.  We resented him wasting our time when we were trying to wrap it up and get home. It took about two and a half hours at the dealership.  Most of this wait was caused by finance...

Roland delivered the car. It was polished like a diamond, and he took about a good 15 minutes explaining the radio to me.  I had lots of questions, and he gave me precise answers and showed me how to do each thing.  He also said to call or come by with any other questions that came up later.

He is a great sales person.  He has been at the same dealership Eight years! Alex has been 30 years!  They are the best two people to work with.  I can see why they are kept by the management.  It makes the dealership look good.

They honored their bid, no fees or other charges were snuck in.  I felt really good dealing with these guys.",5.0

When I confronted them with this information, they tried to lie to me about it being a different car.  Once I proved it was the same car, they came clean, and said they didn't want to offer the price they had given me, so they made up the story that it had been sold.  I was pretty mad, so I asked to see the Director of New Car Sales, Mike Grewenig, and as soon as he started talking, it was obvious to me that he was part of the whole scheme.

226,"February 16, 2014","I went to Joe Myers on Feb. 8, 2014 just to test drive a used vehicle to see if I liked it. My salesman, Quincy, was very nice. He had Bruce, a manger, come meet me after the test-drive.  I was already in my truck getting ready to leave.  Just out of curiosity I asked what would be the lowest price they would take for the vehicle. Bruce runs inside to get me a price. ""You can have it for what we paid for it = $23,630 and if you come in right now I'll even take another $100 off"" Bruce says. I said I would think about it and left. I went back a week later. Quincy brought his manager, Larry, to speak with us. I went inside and boy, did the games begin. First Larry brought out a paper that has $27,000(+) on it that's more than their own list price on their website. I told him Bruce told us $23,530.  Larry said that Bruce can't give that low of a price. Larry goes on to say that they are already losing money on the deal.  He then showed us paperwork that said they paid $22,100 for the vehicle.  So now Bruce is a liar, too.  Larry tells us that he’s been in touch with a lady from Dallas about the vehicle – another sales tactic.  I asked why they would lie to their customers – Larry said it’s a sales pitch to get you in the door and then find out that their manager denied the price that was offered.  Bruce also told them he didn’t remember saying anything to us. I asked them why they would do business this way especially with all the social media with which to spread their sleazy way of doing business. Larry then suggested that we finance thru them and if we happened to get a low interest rate it would make up for the higher price of the vehicle. 

My dad tried to purchase a car from Joe Meyers a couple of years ago and ended up walking out after he negotiated a price because of the sales pressure for the extended warranties, etc.  He patiently told them no several times during a 45 minute pitch and they still wouldn’t take no for an answer.  

It’s unbelievable that you probably have 2-3000 vehicles for sale all within 2 miles in which to pick from and they still have to treat their customers like their idiots. 

If you meet Larry, save yourself hours and just leave. By the way, according to Larry, Bruce can't make you a good deal either.

I received exceptional customer service, in used cars, all the way thru to the service department.. There were a few things the 1992 Toyota camry needed and Joe Myers service took good care of me and the car. I paid cash for my car. I was highly impressed with the service dept.  I called in on a Monday at  6:45 a.m to see if they were open yet, & a service advisor answered the phone. Excellent customer service. Everyone treated me really nice. Made me feel like I was the only customer.  Anyone who answered the phone in service, was very professional. It was a great dealership experience. I had been looking for a used car for a while, & went to other dealers, but Joe Myers gave me the best service. My sales person gave me undivided attention.  when I took my car to the service drive, for a few things to be done, I even had the wonderful opportunity to meet Jerry Rocco, who does the Toyota commercials with his daughter. I love the commercial. It is so personable.  He is really that personable in real life, very nice person.  really eager to help me. So I had a great experience at Joe Myers, when I am ready to buy a new vehicle, I will definitely go back to Joe Myers. The entire dealership was so nice to me.

241,"December 06, 2012",HORRIBLE HORRIBLE DEALERSHIP. I went in looking for a new vehicle got thrown all around the place and spent hours on hours waiting. No one informed me of anything! I was just sitting there waiting with no direction. I ended up buying a vehicle but it still had to go into the garage. So I was given a loaner for the time being. Two days went but and there was absolutely no word from Emerico. So I called him and couldn't get ahold of him all day. I finally got ahold of him at the end of the day and he said they had to get parts for the vehicle and they ordered the wrong ones. So it would be another day the next day I went back to get my car. After an hour of Houston traffic I got to the dealership and had to wait for him to get done screwing someone else over. Then I was informed the car is not done it had just been detailed but still has to go trough the garage. Needless to say two more days went by without a word!!! Horrible customer service they get paid a commission for the sale why wouldn't you want to keep the customer informed and happy. Well I finally have the car and the check engine light is already on and I just picked it up 3 days ago! STAY AWAY FROM THIS DEALERSHIP!!! Save yourself the headache I promise you will have a better experience elsewhere! ,1.0

244,"June 26, 2012","Terrible experience with this dealership trying to get work done on a vehicle that was purchased from it with additional coverage policies. I bought the Highlander new with a policy that was to cover door dings and scratches. The dealership refuses to do any work, now claims I have to contact some other company directly (and they keep sending me to the wrong company), and claims that scratches are not covered. Know that extended warranties are a waste and that Joe Myers does not stand behind products it sells. And, it took 30 minutes to find all of this out because of being transferred from one department to the next. They hang up on you or rudely transfer you without understanding what you just told them. Same with Victor--telling me to call someone I just told him directed me to call the dealership. Never again with Joe Myers, and maybe never again with Toyota.

I went into their dealership with every intention of purchasing a Toyota Tundra Texas Edition.  I spoke with a Sales Associate and a manager and they were to locate a specific vehicle (color, style etc.)and they were to call me back.  After a few hours, I had not heard from either one of them.  I called the manager who had originally helped and asked for the status of my quote.  He said that he would have to check and call me back within the hour.  
Well, 2 days later with not hearing from anyone, I stopped in at Don McGill in Katy.  Within a few hours, I was proud owner of a 2012 Toyota Tundra which I plopped down $37K for.

250,"October 31, 2011","I went to Joe Myers after having a less than stellar experience at Don McGill toyota. I came in armed with the pages of 3 different cars they had on their website that I wanted to drive. My father and I pulled up and Cesar greeted us before we even got to the entrance to the used car show room. He immediately took my papers on the cars and went to look them up. He said one or two of the ones I'd found online had been bought but he would show me ones that were very similar. He pointed the cars out to me and let my dad and I look around and ""kick the tires"" so to speak, while he went and got the keys for the 3 different cars I wanted to test drive (an altima, corolla and camry). We got to the dealership a little after 6:30 and I'd already driven 2 cars by 7 PM. After driving the 3rd I decided on a 2011 camry. There was only one problem, the car i'd brought the paper in on was a 2010 camry, so my dad and I immediately braced for a price increase. Without us even having to ask, Cesar got his manager to approve selling me the 2011 for the same price as the 2010 was listed. I was filling out paper work by 7:30, in the finance section by 8 and driving away in my new car right when the dealership closed at 9. I had to go back the following Monday so they could touch up my bumper (a scratch I hadn't even noticed in the dim light but one they insisted on fixing)and upon hearing that they were going to need to refinish it instead of just touch it up, Cesar took me to lunch (he knew I was taking my lunch break from work in order to get this fixed). I would highly recommend Joe Myers and Cesar to anyone looking to buy a car.

254,"October 19, 2011","On 10/18/11 I purchased a 2012 Toyota Tacoma, regular cab, 2-wheel drive, with automatic transmission from Joe Myers Toyota in Houston. I had spent 1 month searching Toyota dealers via Internet in Tyler, Dallas, Ft. Worth, Austin, and Houston for this vehicle. I wanted a bare-bones Tacoma with automatic transmission as the only option for $19,000 drive-away price including tax, title, and license. Mr. Argueta responded that he had a silver one. I drove 300 miles from Canton, Texas (60 miles east of Dallas), and the truck was prepped, full of gas, and ready to go. It took 45 minutes to buy the truck, and I drove it home. NO OTHER DEALER WOULD MEET THE $19,000 PRICE. The next best price was $19,300, next after that $19,465, next after that over $20,000. I was pleasantly surprised to find the truck equipped with a rear window that opens, carpet floor mats, extra tiedowns in the bed, a bed liner, an air conditioner that will blow you out of the truck, a fancy radio and CD player, and keys I could duplicate at Wal-Mart for $1.75 each. In short, I got a lot more truck than I expected for the price I was willing to pay. I'd say that if you're looking for a dealer that deals, contact Mr. Arqueta at Joe Myers Toyota.

Let me clarify, we DID end up purchasing a car here, but the experience was nothing like any of my previous ones. The only reason why we ended up purchasing was because we needed a car right away and did not have much time to research. You are going to get the typical run around, they'll start you up REALLY HIGH and will lie to your face as to what they can and can't do. I think I would know what is and what is not doable since this is my third vehicle purchase in 4 years(the other two were brand new though). Overall review, of transaction and delealership: unorganized and unsatisfying. If you are not familiar with dealing with dealerships, DO NOT COME HERE, you will not get a the pleasant satisfaction of your first purchase.

269,"July 09, 2011","Let me start out with my new car story. Bought my car around the time the government was issuing discounts for cash for clunkers. New car salesman, Alex, was very helpful, kind, and informative, and we were able to work out a deal on a new car.

However, I felt bad a few months later when I learned that car was one of many that could have had a fatal defect. This is no fault of the dealer I think, but more a fault of the company. Something I will definitely consider when buying my next new car.

Overall, the new car experience went as smoothly and comfortably as possible, even though it took extra effort on our part to get the cash for clunkers info lined up right.

Service -- service experience since then has been really good. Usually I deal with Tony in the service department. The guys down there tend to take really good care of their customers. Price for service could be better in some areas, but overall this was acceptable. My car is still running very well, and I have only had to perform routine maintenance -- @25000 miles.

Later, I was shopping for a used car listing for my Fiance. On their website it was listed, and I called ahead to verify that it was in stock. Upon arriving, I had to wait 15 minutes, talking to some of the other salesmen, who weren't all that bad while waiting for my own contact to materialize...looking back, I wish I had dealt with them. My salesman finally showed up. Apparently he doesn't work in the used car building? Very confusing. But whatever. He informs me that the someone had taken the car I was looking for on mechanical leave for the day (arranged for them to bring it to their own mechanic), and had it basically for the entire day. I was upset, since I had called to make sure it was in stock already, but I didn't show it much.

The manager came over and assisted the salesman in asking me questions about my price range and what kind of model cars I am looking for. I gave them about 3 or 4 models of cars, and begrudgingly, my price range. They were very prying and intent on getting the information. I generally don't like to tell a dealer what I'm willing to pay up to, but I figured in this case, it might help them search for a car faster.

Unfortunately, they did not have any of the models of cars I was asking for in stock. I wanted to just say good day, but they insisted on showing me a hyundai and mercury that were not on my list. Both had terrible drive, and I could tell from looking at them that they would need some sort of mechanical repair within the next 20k miles.

I told him I was not truly interested, but I would tell my fiance about the cars. What a waste of my evening. I think they intentionally did not tell me the car I had originally come for was on leave, just to bring me in and get me interested in something else.

Throughout the entire process the used car salesman seemed uninterested in me or my opinions. The manager did the best he could to help find another offering, but they both were pushy and intolerant of my purchasing constraints. Also, their prices generally are very high, used or new. I'm thinking without the cash for clunkers I might not have even bought my own car here. Service I still think is great though, and think I may continue going here for the service.

I came and he showed me the car and all the bells and wissels and his knowledge about BMW was outstanding and more than i was expected from a Toyota sale person, i was very please with his treatment and i told him that i still have to go to 2 different dealerships that has similar vehicles with cheaper prices. So he insisted to know the location on those vehicles so he can look them up online and do a little comparison. so he was right and showed me that the car he was selling me has less miles, way more options and 1 owner verses the others...

274,"November 16, 2010","I was looking for a low priced used car for my son in college and had gotten the runaround earlier from another dealership. These jerks had wasted most of my day so I was in a foul mood. I called Joe Myers Toyota regarding a specific used vehicle I'd seen on the internet. I told them that I wasn't coming in unless that car was sitting on the lot and he (the salesman) was personally standing next to it. He said he would check and call me right back. He called back and said that car had been sold, asked my price range and type of car I was looking for, and ran through several others on the lot. Since I was open to other vehicles, I listened, made note of one I liked, said I would look into it and get back to him. I did end up finding one on their lot that I liked and bought it. Bottom line, if you need a cheap (under $7K) used car and don't mind cars that aren't showroom perfect, they have a pretty good selection. Do your research ahead of time, and ask for Khalil in internet sales. He's honest and will help you get into a decent cheap car.",4.3

276,"August 05, 2010","Had to buy my daughter a car so she could get around town.  She investigated cars on line and found one at Joe Meyers which would suit her needs and not be overly expensive to me.  She called ahead of time to see if the car was still available and was told yes so we went to the dealership.  Upon arriving, as soon as we got out of the car, David approached and took us inside to see what we needed.  As he was a fairly new employee, Martin (not really sure that was his name but my daughter thinks yes) came over to help as well.  Their friendliness was never a question.  We enjoyed talking with them but we do feel they lied to us about the car.

When we went outside to look at the available cars, David showed us several cars that weren't on our ""approved"" list.  That's ok because that's salesmen doing their thing.  We stuck to our list and ended up with only a couple of cars we wanted to see which included the researched one.  I commented to Martin that I had never gotten out of a car dealership in less than 4 hours.  He said we would make it out in under 2 1/2 but we didn't, was closer to 3 1/2.  Partly because it took them so long to present the car and we think it was because there were issues with the car (the brake light - see my daughter's review).

Even that would have been ok as we agreed to buy the car ""as is"" but we asked specific questions on the car and were assured each time we asked that this problem or that problem had been taken care of on this particular car.  We asked these questions before we signed the paperwork, after we signed the paperwork and finally as we were about to get in the car and drive it away.  Why did we ask the same thing over and over again?  I think because it is a used car and ""as is"" meant we were accepting it with potential problems but we were trying to cover all bases and make sure we weren't getting problems that supposedly had been solved.  Turns out this gave both of the men a chance to lie to us three times.  No, excuse me, only two times.  The first time we asked, they told us they would check the fluid levels and make sure they were filled and also check the air in the tires and also lubricate the back door and the driver's side door and this would all be done while we were doing the paperwork.  The car actually sat in the lot until we had finished the paperwork before they took it to the garage.  This was when they should have done all the fluids check and lubrication but obviously they just washed the paint off the car and that was it.

The next time we asked about the fluid levels and lubrication was when we were lied to and they said everything had been taken care of.  And we asked one more time and were again told that everything was filled, the door lubricated and the car washed.  We still had to get David to take off some signage with the car so the car went back into the garage one more time and gave them one more chance to fix the questions we had raised but they didn't.  

When we finally drove away, we had negotiated a price based on the internet price which we would not have gotten had we not known it in advance.  Their ""walk in"" price was $1000 more than the internet.  There were also two cracks in the windshield which were covered by the ""For Sale"" paint job.  Seems like a bit of a deliberate cover up but I think that because of the other things they lied about.  They washed the car before we took it so the For Sale paint was gone but by then, we had ownership so we get the cracks.  Next time we will look ""under"" all the paint as well.  next time we will get out the manual also and check what it says about fluids and levels.  They did have a CarFax but that didn't cover the small items that should have been fixed before selling a car, I feel.  All these items were small but it meant chasing around town for my daughter trying to find out what was wrong and how to fix it.  She should not have had to do this immediately after buying a car when we had asked about these items.  There was a big problem with the brake light which you will see if you read her review so I didn't cover it.  ""As Is"" when you buy a car is fine but we should have been much more vigilant and will be in the future when we buy a car from a different dealership because we won't go back there.",2.8

I bought a used vehicle, as is so I understand there might be issues. However, when I realized I had been lied to about said issues that is when I realized I had been given bad service and taken advantage of.

If you are buying from this dealer, make sure you do these things. 1 - be with the salesman when they start the car the first time. Don't let them bring it to the front. There are potentially many issues upon starting a car that you will miss if you allow them to bring it to you. 2 - get the manual out to double check all components and liquids in the engine. Do this before the car gets too warm on a test drive. Following are the explanations of why I suggest the above.

I asked several times if all the fluids in the car were taken care of and filled. I was told to my face, ""yes, they were"" several times by both sales reps. A few days later, when I had time, I reviewed all liquids in the engine. I found that the engine coolant was at the low mark (the lowest it should be before refilling), the windshield washer reservoir had nothing in it as well as no cap. The power steering was also at the lowest level it was supposed to ever get. Having all these liquids be low is at the most potentially dangerous, at the least it is negligent since I did request these be taken care of and was assured they had been. David did drive me out to a spot away from the dealership and opened up the engine but it was hot and I wasn't familiar with the layout so didn't have the luxury of looking closely. I should have gotten the manual to see where all the liquids were but I took their word that they were taken care of.

Secondly, David brought the car to the front door of the dealership (from all of 20 feet away). I thought at the time that he was taking a long time to bring the car. I saw him sitting in the car for about 5 minutes doing things. I thought he was trying to get it to cool off and that perhaps there was a problem. However, when he brought it over, all looked fine. Every day after I bought the car, the first time the car is driven, the emergency brake light comes on - regardless of if the brake was on - and it stays on for about 20 minutes or until I mess with the brake system enough that it finally turns off. Since it did it the first day and every day afterwards, I'm pretty sure, upon reflection, that this is what David was doing because the odds are not in their favor that it never came on until the very day I bought it? I doubt it. Thus, David was trying to get the brake light off when he was ""busy"" those 5 minutes before bringing the car. When I asked him about it, he claimed ignorance and said it must be a brake problem and I should probably go get it checked. Plus, when the car first starts, it stutters a lot but after it runs for about 5 minutes, it smoothes out. However, if I had been aware of the stuttering, I might have had second thoughts because no one likes to hear their car's engine stutter.

Thus, originally, my experience was ok but the straight faced lying has dropped them too bad. One would think with all of Toyota's difficulties lately, the service would be something they would step up. Perhaps they are expecting buyers who are completely unaware of Toyota problems.

One final thing, the car I was interested in and finally bought was on the website at one price. At the dealership, they quoted me a $1000 over that price.

After this review was written, I have been contacted by the manager who apologized and asked if there was anything he could do. I suggested they help me with the brake light issue. They are willing to take a look to see what the problem might be but no guarantees of anything other than a look.",2.2
278,"May 27, 2010",Great Dealership. Salesman Jeff Gunn was very helpful and took the time to show me every car with all the options I was looking for. I feel I got the best deal possible. Customer service manager James was also very helpful made sure I was taken great care of.  I would definitely recommend this dealership to all my friends and family.,5.0
279,"May 27, 2010",They were so helpful and friendly in helping me find a new car. Better than any other toyota dealership I went to!! They did a great job and I'll definitely recommend them to others! The Salesmen too time to make sure I would enjoy the car and showed me every new feature of the model while test driving it. The manager Mr. Gorbet was extra helpful and friendly and the finance person Rene Gonzalez worked quickly with the paperworks but also made sure we understood all the paperwork. Great dealership!,5.0
280,"May 25, 2010","In a city the size of Houston, TX, I was surprised to be treated as a regular in a small-town dealership.  My first car had a problem and they “re-called” it and gave me a new one for the same price.  After a few routine visits, I was greeted by name when I drove up and walked in.  There is no way to improve the service and general experiences I have gotten there.

282,"May 14, 2010","Previous ca overheated and was too expensive to repair...went to Joe Myers Toyota looking for new car.  James and Jeff answered all my questions about different models,  gas mileage, etc.  They were very patient as we went from model to model and color to color.  When we settled on car, we bought a Camry, they gave me a great price with no nonsense or confusion.  Every aspect of transaction went smooth...from picking car, to getting a fair price,,,to getting through finance,  A wonderful dealership  ",5.0
283,"February 15, 2010",First time at Joe Myers Toyota. Long line of customers was a Saturday but they greeting me fast. Managers were greeting and that was nice touch. Everyone was smiling even though clearly very busy. Waiting room was very full but still clean and everybody smiling. Enjoyed water and warm cookies while waiting. Was done when promised and very happy with experance. Service Director Kenneth Hutchings checked on me personally and was very pleased with entire experance. ,5.0
284,"January 29, 2010","Stay away from this place! I set up an appointment with Khalil to look at a used Nissan 350z. Before driving all the way out there (about 30 miles from my apartment) I called the number he gave me to make sure the car was still there and left a message. He didn't call me back, so I assumed (to my detriment) they would keep the appointment. WRONG. When I got there, some genius who barely spoke English started badgering me literally as soon as I opened my car door. When I told him what I was looking for, he immediately started talking about a Lexus LS, trying to get me interested in that one instead. When we got inside, he spend about 15 minutes puttering around and telling me to wait. Finally I asked someone else to help me (Khalil wasn't working at that time) and they told me the car had already been sold. THANKS FOR NOTHING.",1.0
285,"October 11, 2009","I went to Joe Meyer's Toyota on Sat. Oct 10th 2009 . I arrived at the dealership about 1:30pm and was greeted immediately by a salesman. He seemed nice and helpful. He asked me what kind of car are you looking for? I told him that we(my wife, daughter and I)are looking for a Toyota Corolla. He showed us a few cars(some were not Corollas). We didn't see any cars that we liked that much. He asked us if we would CONSIDER a 2008 Hyundai Elantra? I said yes I would CONSIDER it, but I needed to know more about the car and we have some other cars we wanted to look at(another words, go to other dealerships). He told me that he would get me some information about the car from Kelly Blue. This made me feel uncomfortable because I like to do my own research. However, I didn't want to cause problems and my wife has a friend that has the car she was told by her friend that it is a OK car. So, we took it for a test drive. We kind of liked it. It wasn't great or bad. 

After the test drive we sat down with the salesman and started talking about price(at this point the salesman manager was involved and he was helpful and nice). As we were sitting there I started to do my own research on the 2008 Elantra (I used my cell phone,www.Edmunds.com). The salesman manager gave me a printout with price information on it. On this piece of paper stated that the car was $15k+ new and they were asking $13k+. I know that was incredible inflated price and I know it didn't sound even close to what the price should be.The salesman stated that he could possibly get it down to $12k(nothing down and TTL included). He went to his manager to get approval. As he went to get approval from his manager 

I went back to www.edmunds.com again and this time looked up the TMV(true market value). For retail(dealership price)the website stated that the car should be about $10k+ or about $11k(with TTL) for the condition it was in(37k miles for 2008).I told both the salesman and manager that they need to do better on the price. They were both disappointed that I said that. But they were continued to work with me. Matter of fact I started filling out the credit application, but stopped until I know we could agreed on a price. As we were talking another sales manager(Robert) came over to try and help. At this point we have been at the dealership for 3 hrs. We were both tired(so was our daughter). Robert, asked if he could helped. I didn't feel like explaining myself to a another person or going through the sales process with another person and I didn't understand he was coming to help now. All I needed was one person. Now, there are three of them. I told Robert that I wanted the car for $10.5k or we are walking. He RUDELY said,""then LEAVE""!!!I was shocked, I said I am sorry we could not work out a deal and went to shake his hand. He looked at me like he wanted to KILL me and he didn't even shake my hand. I didn't understand his behavior. He then again stated VERY RUDELY and HOSTILELY, LEAVE.  (At this point my wife was scared. she got up with my daughter and walk a safe distance away). I said I am leaving. I then started walking towards the door to leave. When I go about 20ft away I turned to him and told him that I can't believe you treat your customers this way. He started charging towards me throwing chairs out his way and he got in my face. At this point I was scared and didn't understand what was going on. There was no cause for this behavior and I never have experience this before. I told him to get away from me, I am leaving. I didn't want to turn my back on this guy because I was scared what he would do. However, I wanted to get out there as quickly as possible. I reluctantly turned and started walking towards the door again. I walked about 10 ft. and then looked over my shoulder to keep an eye on Robert. He was right behind me, about 8 to 10 inches from me. I turned and confronted him and told him to get away again. He took a step forward and I pushed him and told him to leave me alone. I am leaving. I was afraid he was going to jump me if I turned my back to him. 
 By this time I was screaming at him and everyone in the dealership was looking at us. This happened in front of my wife and six year old daughter. This is not what a six year should see in a place of business. 
I luckily got out with out any other physical confrontations, but I am still confused about what happened. We need another car, but now I am afraid to go to another dealership because of this event. I would not recommend this dealership.

286,"March 30, 2009","I went to Joe Myers Toyota on March 17,2009 for a break inspection before I go to Spring Break. It took the 2 and 1/2 hrs for the service. Steven tells me he will call and let me know what happen to my break. It take him 2 and 1/2 hrs and I didn't receive any call. I have to call the dealer myself to check the status of the car. 
Steven told me the break in my car are ok to drive. So I trusted him. Until yesterday 3-29-9, the engine light in my car is on. I bring my car to Joe Myers Toyota this morning to check out for the engine light. Ken Braud helped me today and mention that my break need to be replace. I was shock and told him that I bring my car in 2 weeks ago for a break inspection and the advisor "" Steven"" said the break is still good and don't need to be replace yet. What kind of a service is this? Can the break in my car worn out in 2 weeks? I don't think is possible.
  The guy help me today didn't even look at the history of maintenance of the car. I always bring my car to same dealership for maintain. This is terrible customer service. I trusted this dealership, but after this incident. I don't recommend any people come to the dealership anymore. I could get into an accident on my vacation and injury because of bad break. I bring my car in early in the morning at 7:37 and wait for 2 hours until the guy told me about the engine light and the break problem . 
I am disappointed about this dealership. How could the technician do such a sloppy job of inspected the break. When the customer specific come in the for that reason. I very mad at the manager on duty didn't come out of his office and apologize to me about their mistake. 

Do you think this is good customer service? This is some body life that is endanger that we talking about? If the engine light never pop up and I don't go to the dealership until my maintenance is due. I drive a long distance to go to school and work everyday. I can at risk with my life at anytime when I get into the car.  ",1.0
287,"January 02, 2009",Joe Meyer like to play game. Most vehicles they advertised are not there any more. They use a bait to lure you in and then try to sell you something different. The manager treats you like you are an idiot. They are not very honest with you. Some of the managers seem to be very arrogant. I have bought a Toyota there once in 2003 and this time they really pissed me off and we end up bought the car from Beck and Masten and they were very professional and pleasant to deal with. I will not recommend Joe Meyer.,2.4

In the service department they will try to sell you things you have absoloutely no need for whether it be a filter, belt, ect. All dealerships are really pretty shady but this one goes above and beyond. I was not a car salesman but i talked to them on a daily basis and they were to sell a car by any means, whether that meant lying or any other method. You will be much happier in the future if you buy your car at another dealership, you will not get the best price here and they will get the best of you, take it from someone whos job was to screw over the customer.

291,"December 20, 2007","Joe Meyers Toyota -  BEWARE: I would not buy a new car or truck from this dealer!

Overall I found that the sales department is dishonest and 
they try to trick the customers into spending more that they should, for example:

When I was buying my new Corolla they dated the contracts 3 days ahead of the current date. For those of you that don't know. State law allows anyone to get out of a contract if you change your mind within 3 days. But this dealer tried to change the date but I caught it and made them correct it.

The second item I have to mention is that the finance director stated that 
Toyota Corporation does not have any extended warranties but that the dealer can sell me a overpriced extended warranty from some off the wall company. In my opinion the dealership lied to me. I would not recommend 
doing business with them. I will not buy another Toyota from them or recommend them to anyone.  ",1.0

293,"March 06, 2006","We are a mature couple who bought a car there for our daughter. My wife and I went there Thursday night to check out Corolla's and that's all we were interested in. They tried the switch technique and I steered them right back to the Corolla, and made it very clear that is what we would buy - PERIOD. I made this visit ahead of time because I would be gone Saturday and my wife and daughter would return there on Sat morning. It should have been a straight-forward deal, since all they had to do was pick out the color and write a check, and we were paying cash.
I left for Dallas Saturday morning and bought a new Honda Civic there and was in the dealership for 30 minutes total. My wife and daughter were at Joe Meyers Toyota for over THREE HOURS!!! Quite a difference, eh?
She wrote a check for $11k and I just tried to call them to see if the check presented any problem for them because it still hasn't cleared. First I was grilled about who I wanted to talk to and was told there were seven people in finance, and none of them were managers. I was forwarded and the man who answered said he was with a customer and hung up. I called back and asked to speak to anyone in finance who could talk on the phone. I got an answering machine. I called back and asked for the same thing again, and again got an answering machine. I called back and asked the operator if she wanted to write down a message for them since she didn't seem to be able to connect me to a live person who could talk on the phone. You guessed it! Answering machine. After fifteen full minutes of trying to reach anyone in their finance department, I gave up. If the check was a problem, then let them deal with it!
