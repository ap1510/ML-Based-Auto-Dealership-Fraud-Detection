9,"June 11, 2020","Found a truck on Autotrader, also looked it up on the dealership website, and sent an inquiry from their website. Asked for the out the door (OTD) price in the initial inquiry. Received a response from two different individuals from the sales department, neither addressed, nor included the OTD quote. Most places require two prompts for the OTD price, so nothing out of the ordinary yet.

One response included the subject “Crest Nissan is honored to assist you”. Sounds good, but as the communications continue, seemingly just empty words in the end, no substance. The email I received from the “Internet Sales Manager” included this phrase: “My ultimate goal is to make sure you have an exceptional experience here at Crest Nissan, and to make sure you have all the information you need to make an informed decision.” More placebo.

Also of note is that when I first found the truck the advertised price on both platforms was $16498. That was Saturday, and by Sunday it was $17548. A couple of days later it showed to be $16952, with a note on one of the pictures of the truck (on their website) price lowered! Is it really lowered when you raised the price previously? And on 6/11/2020 the price shows $16948.

Asked for the OTD price a third time, still no response, just another question about when I could come see the truck. At this point I began to question the lack of pricing transparency, first red flag. Second red flag, the changing sales price.

I requested the OTD price again explaining that my financial institution needed to know the OTD price to provide an accurate interest rate, since that is based on the loan to value ratio. I did not hear back from Shon (he might have been busy, or off that day), so I forwarded the email to Mark. I was then informed of this bit of info by Mark: “We price our vehicles assuming our customers will be financing with us.” Reading between the lines I asked if this meant the price of the truck would be higher if I had my own financing. Mark replied with: “It's 10% higher, and we can most likely get whatever your bank is giving you.” Third red flag! This was not disclosed anywhere on either platform.

Why would a stealership “force” you to finance with them??? So they can make their money on an inflated interest rate. The advice has always been, have your financing lined up prior to stepping foot into a dealership. This is helpful in determining how much you are able to borrow, and the interest rate, which too will impact what you can afford on a monthly basis… remember the phrase “to make sure you have all the information you need to make an informed decision.”

Oddly enough I also received an email from the Internet Sales Director to check in with me. His email included this phrase: “I also wanted to let you know about our Best Price Guarantee and our 3-day, no hassle, return policy. Overall, I want to make sure you are completely satisfied! “

I replied to the Internet Sales Director to state my observations up to this point. It appears that this was forwarded to Shon, who then replied. In his reply he stated: “negotiations are always done best in person to make sure you're serious, and not curious”. The reason for internet departments is to cut through the chase, agree on a price (which is listed online), and barring any issues with the vehicle makes it a done deal. Regarding “serious, and not curious”, does that not contradict the “make an informed decision” comment? If you are not willing to inform a curious customer, he will not turn into a serious buyer.

He also stated: “If you would like me to print the numbers up for you so we can work a deal before you arrive, I have no problem with that.” To which I commented “I have asked for the out the door price three, or four times, so I am unclear as to why this would still be a question at this point.” Regarding his statement “So we can work a deal before I arrive” What is there left to negotiate? The price should be the advertised price, plus applicable taxes (inventory tax, sales tax, title & registration fees), and any document fees your dealership charges.”

When I inquired with my financial institution about an estimated OTD price of $18500, that was already at 108% loan to value. So if Crest were to add many of the fees on that are mentioned in many of other reviews, it would increase the interest rate even more.

Oddly enough, no response back from Shon, not even 24 hours later - why would that be? Because he already knows that the bogus, and unrealistic additional charges will not be accepted? It makes it appear as they only like to deal with customers they can bully, or are so timid that they will just accept all of the charges they want to tack on, after they get you in the door. Any dealership that is truly transparent with their pricing will let you know up front what the out the door price is and honor it when you walk in the door.

Many reviews have mentioned this stealerships practice of listing a sales price, want you to come into the stealership and then inflate the price. As well as wanting to run a credit check right away. 

Most dealerships have adopted to the new age, this dealership appears to still use sales tactics from the 1970's.

Same standard reply on negative reviews: ""we take customer satisfaction very seriously here at Crest Nissan, and we’d love to hear more about your experience."" How about fixing the issues from the start, change your unprofessional business tactics, and you will not have a need to fix them after the fact.

When reviewers mention the additional charges for dealer prep, etc. that they refused to pay the response from Crest is usually ""Unfortunately, we are not always able to come to an agreement on pricing"". This has nothing to do with ""pricing"", you advertised a sales price online, that:
a. you increase when outside financing is used
b. apparently charge for certified warranties on vehicle that were advertised as certified to begin with
c. apparently  charge dealer prep/dealer added ""options"" on used cars",1.0

72,"February 22, 2020","I had service done on 2/21/20 and what a major disappoint I had with the Service Department Service Advisor Robin Bunch, and the Service Manager Steve Simmons.  I have purchased several cars from Crest back when they were in Plano off 75, from Crest Cadillac Frisco, and Crest Nissan.  Along with my several purchases, I have taken my vehicles to the service departments and have always been more than pleased with the treatment and customer care I received at all of the locations giving Steller survey reviews, until my visit 2/21/20.  I brought in my daughter’s 2019 Altima with 13,047 miles for a simple oil change and tire rotation.  I had an appointment for this service and clearly stated that I was bringing in vehicle for an oil change and tire rotation.  Robin Bunch informed me at drop off that for approx. $125 that there is the package that includes oil change, tires rotation, and engine, coolant conditioning & system cleaning treatment.  I agreed to all I listed because when I asked Robin if that is the service for the vehicle she said yes.  At 11:16 AM I received an email stating my vehicle is still in the shop, but the multi point inspection was provided where I notice that the oil change is actually $83.85 and the engine, coolant conditioning & system cleaning treatment is an additional charge of $53.95.  I did not see the email right off, but at 11:34 AM I responded back to Robin informing her not to do the $53.95 service only the oil change.  Robin then returns comment back to me at 11:34 saying all of the work was completed and my car was at the wash.  I thought and commented back how fast my car moved along even though I just received notification.  
To wrap up my disappointment with this visit I did not want to pay for the $53.95 treatment I did not want.  Robin had an attitude with me at time of pick up, and I asked for the manager.  Speaking with Steve (who had very little to say), he said well “next time” just ask for the regular oil change and I will not get the $53.95 treatment.  He refused to take off the treatment.  I asked Steve that if he rather lose me as a customer than fix the matter?  He decided against that.  I paid the $53.95 and decided for this little up sale they will lose me as a customer.  I am all about customer service, which is a huge reason that I choose to conduct business with Crest, but I guaranty I will not give Crest Auto Group another sale or penny of my money!  I live in McKinney and choose to come to Crest, but they are not the only Nissan dealership around…Nissan of McKinney here I come.  I work for Raytheon and I will do all I can to share the unpleasant experience with fellow employees so they choose to buy or take their vehicles elsewhere.  I bet I do not get the survey for this visit, I wonder why not?
I almost forgot watch out for the “Tri-pak Engine Oil Conditioner, Coolant Conditioner Fuel System Cleaner”; it is not a required purchase.  You can just get an oil change.

83,"February 01, 2020","Alyssa Sturkie is by before one the best service advisors I've dealt with at Crest Nissan's service department.  I would like to commend her on clearly and succinctly communicating in a way with me where I understood the purpose and value behind all repairs that I received.  I know that advisors tend to a lot of customers in one business day.  However, she was clearly focused on providing me the bar service while I was physically present as I observed through her direct eye contact ( lack of eye contact may demonstrate that the advisor is not focused on you or not confident in what they're telling you). I give five out of five stars to Alyssa.  Her approach was professional and courteous. Alyssa left me feeling like my business is appreciated at Crest despite the many customers she sees in one day. She's a winner.

89,"January 24, 2020","Wonderful car buying experience! Brandon, who sold me my car, was fantastic. Very polite amd helpful. He wasn't pushing anything like I was expecting. He was great and I wish he worked for a different dealership so I could buy from him again. The rest of my experience has been less than terrible. First, my car was not looked over before I left with it, although they would like me to believe it was. A few days after getting home I needed to fill my washer fluid, that's where my problems began. My coolant cap was missing. After looking around for anything else, I found most of the pins holding my skid plate were gone as well. My tires are two different brands and three of my interior buttons were sticky and stuck. Now I didn't notice the button during the test drive as I didn't test each button, who would? One of my nice wheels has clearly kissed the curb quite a few times as I found out after getting the car detailed. I sure wish I had thoroughly combed this car before I purchased it for nearly 20K. I will absolutely never return to thos dealer. I do not live near Frisco and drove there assuming that someone would be willing to help me. The service dept claimed that the coolant cannot possibly be contaminated by driving 489 miles with no reservoir cap, the plastic pins in my skid plate commonly fall out too. He actually said that they just fall out on their own. I asked if we could replace the pins and coolant. He said they could put some pins in if I really wanted them, but the coolant wouldn't be replaced unless I paid for it. Lastly, I have been dealing with my license plates issue for a week now.

181,"August 15, 2019","Why make an appointment? 
I bought a car here. Certified Pre Owned. Also the most inclusive/expensive warranty they sold. Which included no deductible and free rentals. 
Now for my issue. 
I had an appointment for 9 am. I was about 15min early. No other car was even in the drop off area, that's how slow it was. They check my issue, look up my coverage and send me to waiting are for a rental. AN HOUR later and numerous others customers leaving in rentals I'm still waiting. No update, no nothing. Still not sure what the xxxx the appointment was for.... Sure not to make anything faster. 
Now, this is in no way my only/first BAD experience with this place as a whole. From sales to service. I have purchased 3 vehicles here in past 3 years or so. First was not bad at all. Last two we have had nothing but issues.  At one point the washer fluid stopped shooting on my 6 month old car. They said it was a blockage and they cleared it this time for free. For FREE!? It was purchased from you less than 6 months ago! Only hade one service, done by your shop!? xxxx right you do it for free! Why would that have a blockage after only 6 months? And your shop only one to EVER put fluids in the engine area? 
Just stupid stuff out of that place. Either the advisors are clueless and really shouldn't be answering questions or the techs are. Or both. Not sure. 
Off to a different mechanic to have it all checked out. As I have reported other concerns and they say "" it's nothing, everything is fine"". It will be BBB report if different Nissan service department finds what I have suspected was wrong all along. ",2.6

Cole in Internet Sales was fantastic.  He listened carefully to the goals I wanted to achieve with my new car and helped keep me on point to ensure my important items were going to be addressed by the car and models I was interested in.  He was interested in getting me in the right car instead of the biggest or most expensive one on the lot.

The finance manager, James Brown, was also amazing.  He was fast, thorough and made the whole process very easy and painless.  He worked the deal hard to get the best deal and really did.  I appreciate him tremendously!!

I appreciate this dealership and the people!  This was one of the best car buying experiences that I have had in many many years.  

Thank you Cole, James and the Crest team!!!

I understand it is their job to sell and earn money for their company but he wasnt willing to make negotiations with me. Very aggressive at first and snobbish. He seemed not very helpful and he jst wnt to get as much money from the customer instead of making it more flexible and cater to the customers needs as much as possible. Also they didnt include wverything in the car before i drove it home. They missed to plce the carpets and the cargo cover which was in the package! Good thing i checked the sticker.

My assigned service associate was not present for my appointment and did not keep me updated (I had to call and ask for info), and he continually addressed me by my first name, not by the preferred name that is PLASTERED on my account and paperwork. Add to that, my car wasn't washed for pickup, as promised, and there was significant scum added to the interior of my car during the work. They did run it thru the carwash, adding 15 mins to the wait, but it was certainly not as it has been in the past.

Once he noticed my coffee cup was empty, he met us in the middle of the lot to ask to dispose of the cup, not to attempt to create a sale. We chose our vehicle and immediately met Benny inside with a smile and positive demeanor. Before asking us our payment or credit  score, he asked if our toddler wanted to play or needed any water or milk. How thoughtful! We went into his office and were immediately met by the GM, Mr. Robb Knarr - he wanted to introduce himself and thank us for visiting that morning; we were shocked to see he remembered us from several Nissan past - Robb always provides superior service.. We let him know we had visited another dealership but weren't happy with the vehicle provided or sales experience received. Robb immediately provided accolades to his sales associate, Benny and let us know we came to the right place for a more personalized experience. Benny left a few times to acquire our choices of vehicles but always asked if we needed anything and if we were OK on time (we had a family event that day); he was never gone for longer than 10 minutes. We left the dealership with a better vehicle at a slightly higher price than their competitor but the feeling of value was far supreme. I have never left a vehicle review but feel the exceptional customer service provided by Robn continued by his award winning sales member with Benny deserved that right.

380,"August 11, 2017","I have been a long time Honda owner. I had rented a couple of nissans on trips and really liked my experiences. When car shopping I narrowed down my options between a Nissan Rogue and a Nissan Juke. My shopping experience was wonderful. Andrew was patient while I went back and forth trying to decide but I eventually decided on the Rogue. I was trading in my vehicle and when I saw the offer for my car the increased price point from the ""certification"" I was very dissapointed. I explained my feelings and the manager and Andrew were able to come up with a justified conclusion. I left excited and happy at midnight on a Thursday!!

Two days later I was back because the back right tire had a warning light. I came in and they assessed and informed me it was a nail. They replace the tires no questions asked. A week later the left back tire had a light on (which I was informed had been previously checked). I went back again this time pointing out some of the stuff that was missed the day the car was purchased cause I left so late (gas, dings etc). This service experience was horrible. They didn't tell me what they did to the tire. They didn't clean the car (and I'm pretty sure chipped some of the paint on the hood). They patched up 2/4 issues I mentioned on the exterior. I was told I would get a follow up call and never did. 

One week later my left back tire light is on again. This time I come in and they tell me there is a nail but due to the tread being low they would have to charge me $200 to replace it. I was livid. I have had he car less than one month and I knew I didn't wear the tread that quick. I also think this was something they missed last time. 

However, I pulled myself together and talked to the manager who agreed with me and replace the tire for free. The manager was very kind and Eddie is by far the nicest service guy here (even had them rewash my vehicle because it wasn't cleaned as well as it should have been). 

That's why I'm conflicted. When they are on it, they are on it. But I think they have some good people working there but need to make sure that everyone is being kind for the right reasons. ",3.4
381,"July 20, 2017","The service department of this dealership is a complete disappointment. I made the mistake of purchasing a service plan when I bought my car two years ago at the Nissan of McKinney. Save yourself the MONEY and TIME. My service included oil changes and tire rotations. I used Crest Nissan for the last few oil changes b/c they were closer to my home. On my last visit I waited upwards of 2 hours for an oil change, even though I had an appointment. I dreaded getting my oil changed b/c of the amount of time I had to invest in this simple chore. On my last visit I asked my service agent if these oil changes (that I had pre-paid for at the time I purchased my vehicle) ever expired. I wanted to know that if I didn't have two hours to spend I could get my oil changed somewhere else and always come back to use my remaining pre-paid oil changes. I was told that they NEVER expired.

Today I made an appointment to get my oil changed and a state inspection. I waited my turn to be checked in by the service agent. I then waited 5 minutes as they checked me in. After explaining to them what services I needed I went inside to the waiting area. About 5 minutes later I was approached by the service agent who shared with me that in fact my service plan had expired, and I would be paying for my oil change. I explained that I had been told the oil changes never expired. He told me he would see what he could do. When he returned he told me there is nothing he could do. He printed my service plan and told me I was too late as my plan expired 11 days ago. He explained that b/c the employee I spoke to prior was no longer employed at Crest Nissan that it was too bad for me.  So, because I was given mis-information and because I was 11 days too late they could not be bothered to honor an oil change that I had pre-paid for. They would, however, be happy to complete the service for a fee.

Thank you Crest. You have lost a customer for life.",1.0

After below review was published,  Customer Loyalty Manager and General Manager at Crest Nissan reached out to us and refunded 449.98 charged in options.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
They did not act like they needed my business, apathy at all levels. This was an email I sent to the GM regarding the worst sales experience I had with a dealership. No Response too.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello Tony,

I was looking forward to giving you this feedback.

I was there yesterday at Crest Nissan with my husband to do  lease buy back of a Nissan Leaf. It was the single most unpleasant car buying experience we had. 

None of your team members made us feel welcome. We came there at 12:30 with an appointment and it was 4 PM before I was able to get out. May be your team is not familiar with the buy back process, but that is no excuse to treat a customer who is trying to do business with you like you do not want the business. 

We waited the first 2 hours for your team to even confirm that you will honor the discount NMAC was offering for buy back. Then we were given a quote that had almost 900$ added on to the sale price vaguely described as ""options"". When that was questioned (2 times), it came down to 399$.  While we were waiting, my husband went over to service department to ask if Leaf had any open recalls. They said ""to even talk, you need an appointment"".

It was very disheartening to see the apathy at all levels. Your sales team made it sound like it was the customers fault that we were getting a discount on the sales price!

At the end of it, for the supposed car sale, even after asked, there was nothing done to clean the car, even though there was make ready form which was ignored.

I am sorry to say that Crest Nissan did not meet our expectations in this transaction.",1.0

392,"August 15, 2016","Went in and deal with a salesman by the name of Ernesto for a used car. We were interested in purchasing a used car and he showed us a used car that we liked. We came in later that afternoon to purchase the vehicle and went out to look at the vehicle. It was still there and we were trying to negotiate on the price. He told us we could talk to the manager and see what he could do. We sat in the break room and waited for 5 minutes. He came back without the manager and said that the car has been sold. I knew that he flat out lied to me and left. My brother called the dealership the next day and they called him back and said that the automobile was still there and he has the key in his hand. I value a honest dealership and sale person when I am trying to purchase something with my hard earned money. Unfortunately they did not want my business and even lied directly to my face. The sad thing was that he kept calling me back apologizing that the car was ""sold"" and he was trying to do the best he could. ",1.8
393,"August 11, 2016","I usually don’t leave bad reviews but this horrible dealership deserves to receive one. Never purchase anything from this dealership!! Your car will break down within a week or the service department will break your car. I purchased used 2015 CPO Nissan Leaf from Crest Nissan on 7/19/16. I had to contact the service department less than a week after I purchase the vehicle because of the vehicle’s battery indicator was malfunctioning. Leaf is electrical vehicle, so the battery indicator is a very crucial part of the vehicle.

The nightmare started when I left the car at the dealership. I really did not want to leave the car at the dealership but their service staff insisted that I had to leave the car at the dealership to fix the battery indicator issue. So, I left the car at the dealership for 1 day. – YES. ONLY 1 DAY – I noticed something weird after I picked up the car. The front bumper is damaged (scraped with chipped paint, red, and black marks all over the bumper). Also, there is a small tear damage. I immediately told the service manager that one of their staff damaged the car. At the time, the service manager, Bobby, agreed to fix my car even though “it is not their fault.” He is a liar. He told me that there was nothing red object inside of their dealership that can cause the red marks. However, I saw the red object inside of the service department garage door where every car is passing through. In other words, the red object is like a guarding door for the entrance/exit part of the garage. However, at the time, I did not challenge the service manager because he AGREED to fix the car. So, I just took the photo of the red object. The service manager also told me to wait until he calls me to schedule an appointment to fix the car.

Bobby Carroll, the service manager, is a liar. I waited 11 days to get the response from Bobby. I contacted him via 4 email messages, 7 phone calls, and even left 4 voice messages (2 of them urgent) in order to get his response. I also left messages to 3 other service staffs. One of them promised me that they will leave the note at Bobby’s desk. However, on that day, no one called me back. I did all of these to get a single response from Bobby.

Bobby told me to come to their dealership by 10 am today (08/11/16) to fix the car. However, as expected, none of the staffs did not know what was going on even though I made an appointment with their service manager. They told me that the service manager, Bobby Carroll, no longer works at Crest Nissan. So, basically Bobby knew that one of his staffs damaged my car and made false promise because he was going to quit the job. That’s why he purposely told me to wait until he calls me to fix my car. He did not provide me the specific date to come to the dealership. He just told me to wait until he calls to fix my car. After the wait, he quit the job. That was why he did not respond to 10+ calls and emails. It’s call the classic dealer scam. 

What they do not know is I recorded the whole conversation. The whole thing. I plan to take a legal action against these scammers. I will never purchase anything from them ever again. Horrible service and sales.

394,"August 04, 2016","It has taken Crest Nissan, 6600 TX-121, Frisco, TX 75034 over 4 weeks to repair an air conditioning malfunction on my 2015 Rogue with less than 20,000 miles on it. It is still not done as Crest Nissan Service Manager claims that there are no parts available from TN. If this is how Nissan treats its customers I am NEVER going to buy Nissan again. Imagine, no parts for a brand new vehicle that should not even have a problem...I have even spoken to a Nissan Consumer Affairs Specialist. I will continue to wait to get my car fixed but this is the last time I buy Nissan. I will stick with Mazda, Honda or Toyota....that offer their customers quality and service for their hard earned money. Nissan offers pompous Service Managers with extremely bad attitudes and no parts on hand. Just Disgraceful......

395,"July 05, 2016","I had awesome customer service at Crest Nissan and the dealership had a ""no-haggle/no pressure buying"" business atmosphere. 

A little background on my purchase,  I recently made the decision to purchase a Honda Pilot because our family did not have enough room in my current car.  I did my research on cars.com, found five Honda Pilots from different dealerships and completed online info requests.   Crest Nissan went above and beyond having three different managers contact me along with my sales rep, Trevor Trpkosh.  They were good manager contacts because the managers were not pushing the sale of the car, but instead making sure their sales rep was following up with my request .  The other dealerships' sales reps only did their job and contacted me.  I did not feel as if the other dealerships really cared about me personally and only looked at me as a number.  Crest Nissan took the time to treat me more than just a customer and their employees seemed more personable.  This was a huge factor in my decision to purchase just two days after I made the initial decision to buy a family vehicle. 

What really completed the shopping experience and made it better than any other car buying experience I've ever had before was dealing with Trevor.  He was great as a sales rep and was very personable.   He never haggled the sales price with me and did not pressure me into buying.  I didn't see him as a sales rep, but just someone to talk to about cars.  He has a great personality and was the main reason why I bought the Pilot.  I only expected that day to get a sales price and compare it to the other dealerships.  I certainly did not intend on driving off with their Pilot. Trevor was very accommodating with the price of their Pilot, the estimate on my trade-in and the total drive off price.

Another person to mention was the finance rep, Andy Le.  He made sure I was fully satisfied with my purchase and did not force a warranty plan on me.  I really appreciated that.   He was also very personable and didn't treat me just as a number.   He wanted to make sure my purchase was fully backed by their dealership and gave me a short 6 month warranty plan. I've never had a dealership do this for me.

My investment in a family vehicle was been great and Crest Nissan made sure of it!",5.0
396,"July 01, 2016","If you think about going to Crest Nissan for anything other than tire rotation or oil replacement, make sure to double-check everything they tell you. This week, incompetence and/or negligence of a Crest mechanic put me into large financial risk. I'm not coming back there.

When my AC stopped cooling and I brought the car in for diagnostics, the mechanics didn't notice that the entire front of the engine compartment was green from dry leaked antifreeze. Instead, they recommended AC compressor replacement.

If I listened to their advice, first, I'd waste $1,200 to replace a good compressor. And second, much worse, since they didn't catch the leak – which was much more important (and obvious) – the car would keep leaking antifreeze to the point of permanent engine failure from overheating. I was lucky to have an ex-mechanic friend who looked at it later that day and found the leak. If I were out of town and my wife had to handle this alone, I'd be looking at a massive bill to fix the broken engine by now…

I can't trust these guys any more. They are nice, but utterly incompetent. No reason to pay 50% extra so they can cover their neat facility and the battalion's worth of staff… when a small shop around the corner can do same work much better and cheaper.",2.6

Just two months ago, my parents dropped my car off for me, for an oil change and they did loads of unnecessary things then charged me $365 dollars for it. After we told them, and they realized they were wrong, they gave us four free oil changes to make up for it. Well today, I dropped my car for a state inspection and one of my free oil changes, when they guy stated that it was time for my thirty thousand mile service. At pick up, they charged me $425 which I hesitatingly paid, but when I got home and my parents told me that they paid for all of the same ""services"" just two months ago, I was furious. The service people should have seen in the system that they did the same check ups and filter replacements just two months ago, but no they try to con young students and unknowing types out of money.",1.0

402,"March 04, 2016","I purchased a used car for my daughter at Crest Nissan in Frisco and had a very bad experience. First the finance person was unethical. I told him I wanted a 48 month loan term and he tried to sell me a warranty. He said it would only be $16 per month. When I started to sign the papers I noticed he had extended the load to 60 months without telling me. I caught him and got it corrected. Then there were a few items that I negotiated to be repaired. One was the front grill. It had some deep scratches in it. When I picked the car up I noticed they hadn't repaired that area at all. Instead they painted it so now the deep scratches are just a different color but they are still very obvious. One employee told me the sales rep had over committed. I said ""that's not my problem. A deal is a deal"" I spoke to the sales manager and he refused to do anything more. Again, unethical. They did not honor the deal they made. When I left with the car they didn't put temp tags on it so I had to go back. The receptionist handed me the tags to put on myself. Terrible service after the sale. Then I got the vehicle home and discovered the stereo controls on the steering wheel and the aux port don't work. I realize it's a used vehicle but I would expect a dealership to check everything out and then either fix what is broken or disclose that it is broken. They didn't do either. I've bought a lot of cars and this experience is by far the worst I have ever had at a car dealership. I will not go back to Crest Nissan for my future vehicle purchases. ",1.2

- The best car experience ever, will come back soon. Workers, staffs, everyone just caring and respectful. First time ever to purchase a car and I wouldn't have gone no where else but Crest Nissan. Mr. Leron Walker helped and gave me the highest customer service anyone could receive. The one most reason I purchased a car at Crest Nissan was due to his kindness and helpful features. I give him my outmost thanks. I didn't feel like a customer at all .. but more like a family to be exact and that can't be given no where else but Crest Nissan. So wherever goes at Crest Nissan, I recommend seeing him first for a better experience. As well as Mr. Andy Lee if I named his full name correctly. He as well has my thanks. He went through everything from A to Z, he explained everything throughly. There wasn't nothing I couldn't understand, and all questions I had was answered with nothing but 5 star customer service. His work of art, not even a luxury dealers can come even close to him. Truly helpful in all aspects indeed. Me and my wife, drove from Baton Rouge to Dallas a 7 hour drive to purchase my vehicle and I would make those trips a million times over and over again, there worth it in every way. This is just the best car experience I could ever get, honestly. Next car I purchase or trade will be and I repeat will be at Crest Nissan. I highly recommend it to all those who need a car family, friends all above. After two months or later me and my wife are saving money to return back to purchase a vehicle there again, and I can't wait to see Mr. Leron and Andy. I would write a whole essay and I don't mind it either lol but I'll just make it short, honest and meaningful. Thanks a bunch again to them and I can't wait to visit my brothers/family at Crest Nissan.

I want to say a special thank you to Jason Pickering, Jami Croy, Mark Miller, Christopher Wise, Sam Saidzadeh, and our wonderful consultant Benny Rad for giving us a one-of-a-kind customer service experience & putting together an AWESOME deal. I will be recommending Crest Nissan to all of my family and friends!",5.0
433,"January 01, 2015","Let me start by saying I HATE buying cars. It is a hassle and long process. I contacted the dealership looking for a new vehicle and Trevor Trpkosh answered the phone. Right from the start he had a good vibe and was easy to talk to. We did everything possible in The car buying process over the phone and through email. When I did go to the store for the first time, Trevor had the car pulled up front warmed up on a cold day. He kept his word on everything we had discussed. I got an amazing deal on my new Nissan and was out of the dealership in less than two hours. Trevor truly made this an easy enjoyable process. I will forever buy my cars from Trevor and Crest. Thank you Trevor for everything. You look young but are one of the most knowledgeable and well spoken people I have met. Thank you for making this the best experience ever. Way to go Crest!! ",5.0

435,"December 11, 2014","This is a very good place to go especially if you are getting ridiculous ""deals"" with other dealerships. Amazing work by Richard Spano in particular who saved us almost 140 a month over any offer we had from anywhere else. He took the time to explain the things that were confusing and just worked hard to get us a great deal. AMAZING! So happy with this purchase experience over where we went previously. ",5.0
436,"December 11, 2014","I was in the hunt for a car for weeks, the first dealership I went to I had the WORST experience! They were pushy, everything I asked to have done on the vehicle they said no, they didn't explain anything to me at all. To top it off they ran my credit 6 times which gave me an awful rate of almost 450 dollars on a 12 thousand dollar car!! Needless to say I didn't go with them. I went to Crest Nissan and met with Richard Spano, he actually took the time to explain everything to me in detail so I could make a sound decision, he was not pushy, very personable, professional and actually gave me what I wanted. The customer service from Richard Spano all the way to financing was EXCELLENT! Not only that they saved me almost $140 a month on a $13k dollar car!! If you want someone to shoot you straight and actually work for you, go talk with Richard and he's gonna take great care of you!",5.0
