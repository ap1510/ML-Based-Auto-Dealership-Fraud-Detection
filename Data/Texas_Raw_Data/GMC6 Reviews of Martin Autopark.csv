0,"July 20, 2016","I have no complaint with the salesman Michael Ballard. He only did what he was told by the sales manager. I traded in 2 vehicles, a 2005 Chevrolet ¾ ton crew cab w/ 4 WD, diesel that had less than 25k miles and in excellent condition. I also traded a 2014 Mercedes C250 sedan with 5k miles. After almost 2 hrs. of going back and forth the sales manager told my salesman they couldn’t give me more than 41k for the 2 vehicles. This process included at first not honoring the internet price. According to all trade in values I researched the value of both vehicles and found the value at the least 46k. A friend was interested in the truck and called in the AM on the 11th. After calling 3 times he was told the truck had already sold that morning. He asked the price and was told for 25k. I DO NOT like being lied to. I blame your sales manager. I know you are in business to make money, but I think 6500. on one trade is too much. I went in with trade in values I had researched and had online offers above what you allowed. I have purchased 8 new vehicles in the last 6 yrs. and this was the first time I traded. You got to me this time, but you will never get another chance. I told the salesman that that was the first time I had ever purchased a vehicle without pricing other dealers. Shame on me! Thanks for the worst auto deal of my life and I will let all know about this. Your reputation of being dishonest with customers will hurt you and your dealership. ",1.5

3,"May 09, 2012","I visited several dealerships looking for the truck I wanted. They took the time to find the Chevrolet Silverado I wanted. They had it transferred in from another dealership, and I took delivery from Martin Autopark. They gave me a great price and a fair trade-in, and their salesman John ""D"" was great to work with! I will be back to see them again, when I need a car or truck.",5.0

5,"March 13, 2011",A truly top notch dealership.  I wouldn't go anywhere else.  Five stars.  Jim Sutton and Bill Hurley are splendid.  There is little doubt that a finer Ferrari dealership exists in all of the U.S.  The sales staff is exemplary; from Mike Herbert (General Sales Manager) to Bill Hurley (Finance Manager) to Chris Miller (Detail Executive).  Ben Casper is without question the finest Service Representative I have encountered in all of my considerable years of making such purchases.,5.0
