After looking at vehicle negotiated the price over the phone and when I returned all paper work was ready and vehicle was cleaned and ready to go.

6,"February 24, 2020","I purchased my 2019 Ram Longhorn new from a competitor ""not mentioning any names"" but the service was horrible.  I made appointments and still had to wait hours for simple 5K check ups and oil change.  I talked to Josh and he fixed me right up.  Service was done in a timely fashion in a professional environment.  Much more like the service on my Lexus that i was accustomed to.  Not only will I recommend your service department to everyone but when trade in time comes up I will gladly give your sales department a shot.  Hats off to Josh Geihll and the Nyle service team.",5.0
