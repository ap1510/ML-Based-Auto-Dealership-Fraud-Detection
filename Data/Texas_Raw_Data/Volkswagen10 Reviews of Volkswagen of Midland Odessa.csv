0,"June 16, 2020","I bought a used car at this dealership close to 3 months ago from Bryan Wilson, they want to give you all the glory and attention at the time of sale but once that sale is signed it is downhill from there. Granted a used car is just what it says but I made a call 3 weeks ago to inform him of some front end damage just to see if something could be done and still waiting for that call . My how things change. Had sent him an email shortly after the purchase on a warranty paper and he has yet to find out the answer. I can promise you that will be my last car bought by him and the dealership. I do not recommend Volkswagen of Midland nor Bryan for a salesman. ",1.0
1,"January 03, 2020","I purchased a vehicle from this dealership on Saturday, December 28th. Bryan was our sales person and we really enjoyed working with him. He was very professional and not at all pushy. Our purchase didnâ€™t take long at all since Bryan was very knowledgeable and was able to answer all of our questions and concerns. We are very happy with our 2019 Atlas purchase and will definitely recommend this dealership to family and friends. ",5.0
2,"December 14, 2019",I purchased a pre owned vehicle from Jesse Rodriguez. He was very helpful and made my experience a pleasant one. I hate sitting at a dealership all day and they had me in and out quickly. I highly recommend Volkswagen of Midland and Jesse Rodriguez. ,5.0

5,"February 05, 2019","This is my 2nd service with Volkswagen of Midland 02/05/2019 and my initial 5 star review was not a fluke! These guys are truly awesome. Did not try and upsell my one bit and did a timely job on a service on my 2015 Volkswagen Golf. I believe they also service all other makes and models too! Thank you Vw of Midland team and see you in 5k! 
Sincerely, Kayvon",5.0
6,"October 30, 2018"," Excellent service! I took my VW Golf TDi there on 10/30/18 to get an oil change and was taken care of very well by Rhett. He helped me with a few issues that I was having without a hiccup. I am new to the midland area and was very impressed by his customer service skills. They may be a small dealership, but they don't lack in taking care of their customers. The whole service staff were awesome. THANK YOU! - Kayvon",5.0
7,"January 15, 2018","First experience with this place I had couple months ago when I brought my Touareg TDI for emission compliance repair. When I showed up I was told my car would have to stay there for more then a week to order parts and complete repair (although that model did not require parts, just a computer flush), and they could not offer a loaner car as they had a waiting list for that. It would be nice of them to notify in advance but nobody bothered. I ended up doing this repair in Lubbock VW, - took them 4 hours to complete everything.
My 2nd encounter was with a sale department. I was scheduled to test drive a new Touareg. I came on time, but it turned out the car was not ready to be test driven and would not be ready for couple more days. Why the sale person did not tell me that in a first place when she scheduled that appointment? Probably it slipped her mind. So we agreed she would call me in couple days to schedule another appointment. It has been more then 3 weeks since then. She never called. I am driving new Touareg already, but I bought it in Amarillo. I am NEVER not going to VW of Midland!",1.0

9,"May 14, 2016","My girlfriend and I stopped by this dealer to check out a used car.

First, the interior was VERY dirty. It hadn't been detailed. I assumed it had just arrived, so they hadn't had time to get it clean. 

I made a comment to the salesman about the state of the interior, and he explained that they don't detail cars at the lot. The only way they get cleaned is if a salesman takes it home and does it themselves! What? This can't be correct?!?!

We were still interested enough to take a spin, and I was alarmed at the state of the brakes. We've driven other examples of this model, and knew instantly they didn't feel right. The pedal was extremely spongy and vague. They didn't grind (an indication of worn out pads), so I'm thinking it was maybe an issue with the master cylinder. The brakes should have been addressed before putting it on the lot.

We were also only able to drive the car a short distance (probably a good thing given the brake issue). The car had no dealer plates and the salesman informed us it's around $500 if stopped! 

It was an odd experience.......   ",1.5
