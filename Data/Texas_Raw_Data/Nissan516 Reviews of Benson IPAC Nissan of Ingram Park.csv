0,"March 04, 2020","I had a really bad experience this past weekend.  I had used our companies ""benefit"" TrueCar to find my myself a used F-150 (don't bother with TrueCar, either).  Ran across one offering up $22,721 on TrueCar, minus $500 ""Personalized Pricing"", plus $150 in dealer fees for a total of $22,371.  Had my spiffy Certified Used Car Dealer Certificate and all.  I test drove it on a Friday, then came back with my family the next day to get their seal of approval and do the deal.  All good with the fam, solid price, let's do this.  Get to the table and there's a $3K ""Reconditioning Fee"" tacked on. Never discussed, never even hinted at.  IPAC wouldn't take it off so I walked.  I get needing to make a profit, or not seeing eye to to eye while negotiating, but put it in the price, you know, the one you advertised the vehicle for.  

Total disregard for people's time and effort.  Don't even bother!",1.2

2,"October 03, 2019","It was a terrible experience. A den of thieves. I was quoted one price from the internet sales person and their manager agreed on my payments. When I went in to sign the documents they had raised my payment 100 a month and raised the price of the car up 6000 from what was quoted to me.

I responded to an email from Customer Service and explained to them what happened and their response was, ""Sorry for your incovenience"" nothing about how I was lied to and robbed. 

Nothing but lies and no concern for the customer. Stay away, stay very far away.

Worst experience ever. ",1.2

6,"December 29, 2018","Conclusion - Unfair, dishonest, deceptive practices, unhelpful (except business person Toni), or incompetent people/place. Sales, finance, service, and management ‚Äì down the line. Wish I'd read the reviews first and didn't trust these people. Bad reviews on net are on point - early ones match the recent ones. 

Suggestion - Stay away from this place. I'll NEVER do business with IPAC ever again, nor anyone who worked there.

8,"July 15, 2018","I was told I could purchase two key fobs, then two hours later told that they only had one in stock. But, I could wait an additional two hours and they‚Äôd get another.

9,"June 22, 2018",Damon Johnson and ken from finance don‚Äôt know how to close a deal ! Internet sales show a car for a price plus tt&L and they will not let you have it at that price because they say there loosing money at that price so why the xxxx do you BOZOS advertise a car for a price you won‚Äôt sell at !!

10,"June 06, 2018","Told us we would have to get base model to get payment wanted but 1 day later advertised a upgraded model for 5000 less. Went back to dealership asked for to trade for upgraded model was told it had sold but then found out it wasn't and asked to redo lease with the upgraded model and they wouldn't do it. I have bought 5 Nissans including this one and will not be doing business again. This is how they treat a long time,loyal customer. They made excuses for why they couldn't do the deal when in actuality the could of being that the bank didn't even have the paperwork yet. ",1.0
11,"April 28, 2018","Never got there.Daniel,service advisor contradicts what is said on several websites about reflashing computer after having replaced MAF sensor.Although a shop checked mine with a meter and replaced it,he insists the problem is with the throttle body needing cleaning that has to be done BEFORE flashing the computer.Of course there is a fee.Under 80,000 the flashing should be free,so of course,the cleaning fee!",1.0

14,"March 25, 2018","My TPMS was not working and the light was out. Nissan asked if under warranty, I figured they were connected to a main frame but sales person didn‚Äôt try to find out. Therefore  I called the state of MD and they gave the sales person a number to check for warranty with my cellphone. I started with a team leader called Barry and evidently he passed my information to a Larry without informing me. When I arrived to pick up my car after service an Anthony waited on me. He handed over my remote to the cashier. When I paid for service I drove home to find out my remote was broken and Anthony never spoke a word about my remote. The communication was very poor, you are suppose to keep your clients informed. ",3.0

24,"December 18, 2017","The dictionary defines superlative as: of the highest kind, quality, or order, surpassing all else, or others. Supreme. I define it as Aaron Fernandez. From the greeting to the driving away with a brand new Nissan, Aaron was superlative in all parts of the transaction. Even when I felt the price was a little too high, Aaron took the time to explain to me what I'm spending the additional money for. Even after the sale, Aaron took time to address some concerns I had the next day and fix the issue. For these reasons, I will continue to buy my vehicles from IPAC Nissan. If Aaron goes anywhere else, I'll be following him. This was the best car buying experience I have ever had. Thank you Aaron!! ",5.0

34,"October 28, 2017","My partner and I were comparising shopping for a vehicle. And, what was regarded as an impossible deal at another dealership was actually made posible at IPAC . Without feeling pressured Jerry Tucker was very instrumental  in this whole process. He was also very personable and professional. Adrian Gonzalez was extremely helpful from start to finish and explained everything very thoroughly. The respect and courtesy displayed by this young man  is to be commended. Mr. Martin in finance was very professional and courteous. He never rushed through the process even though it was late in the evening. Stephen Cotter was readily available and courteous in assuring that we be familiarized with the facility and the different departments. We were introduced to Sergio, the service advisor. Who took time out of his busy schedule to go over some of the protocols. It is obvious that associates communicate and work as a team to provide excellent customer service. Mission accomplished! Thank you to all the gentleman mentioned above.

49,"August 02, 2017","Bought Nissan Platinum from Moses. Great car, fair pricing. When I returned to pick up, car was not detailed properly. I have to say Steve w customer relations really went out of his way to make sure we had manuals, that I was able to use the car features and car was cleaned right. He demonstrated excellent customer service and is an invaluable asset to this dealership. He actually made me feel as though he cared about me and that's important. Excellent customer service should be dominstrated from beginning to end, thus creating a loyal customer. I'd probably consider shopping other dealerships for my next car, depending on future service experiences. ",4.0
50,"August 01, 2017","The service department staff lead by Jerrett is one of the most incompetent teams I've ever experienced. I'm a Gunn dealer fan but I did buy my last vehicle from IPAC (never again). I purchased the 36000mile/3year PCP plan to ensure oil changes for my vehicle. The service department failed to honor the plan through its entirety. During the purchase of the plan, I was told that a 2nd vehicle in the family is also eligible for oil service. The service department honored that up to my most recent visit. During my most recent visit, at 2 years 11 month or 35,800 miles into the plan, I was denied service under the PCP plan. I was given a run around and shown paper work I never signed.  In fact the paperwork the service department produced said my plan only included 7 oil changes. 7 oil changes for a $600 PCP plan? That's comes out to $85 an oil change. Only a fool would sign up for that. I will also say that the paperwork never indicated service for 2nd vehicle however it was honored without any trouble for the last 2 years and 11 months or 35800 miles. 

I'll also add that during 2 of my oil change visits, the service department failed to secure the oil plug correctly which lead to a oil spill mess in my garage. IPAC had to send out a crew of 2 to clean up the mess. Needless to say, the 2nd oil spill occurred in the garage of my new home. 

In another instance, I've received my car back in anything other than a clean condition. Grease marks inside the car. IPAC offered trip to the wash tub to correct. I never took them up on it. 

Lastly, the service department damaged my glove box in my 2nd car. 

Beware of IPACs service department. Beware of IPAC in general. ",1.0

When I called the secretary answered politely with,""Thank u for calling Ingram Park Nissan"" I asked for the service department. She huffed and said, ""uh huh"" and then transferred me. When the service representative answered I explained that my sunroof was leaking and that I was under a time crunch, one week, with my pending assignment. He immediately said,"" we can't guarantee that we'll get glass in that quick. And your calling at 2 pm to schedule an appointment"". So, I said,"" well I guess I'm out of luck.

75,"July 20, 2016","NO STEVE GOMEZ!!!
I had bought a new Altima from this dealership back in 2012 from Steve Cotter, a great salesman that is still at this location. I was given a very fair trade in value for my old Maxima, and given a fair discount off the vehicle. I was 1000% satisfied with this purchase. That is why I referred my in-laws to get their vehicle from IPAC in 2013, and that is why I brought my father in to get his Versa the same year. All of these experiences were great, which I can attribute to Steve Cotter overseeing for me when he was not directly involved in the sale. He still looked out for me and still provided me with what I needed to close on my previous deals.
My father went in yesterday to look at a 370z which was priced at just over 27000 sticker price. He was told over the phone they would take 1000 dollars off, and the salesman was very pushy about what a great deal he was getting. I saw through that and told my father to be careful. I had work obligations and could not oversee the sale, but I had told my father to hold off on signing everything, and that I would come after I got out of work. I later found out the name of the salesman is Stephen Gomez. Mr. Gomez tried talking to me over the phone to get me to tell my father it was a good deal. I told Stephen he was giving my father 1000 dollars under what he should be getting from a dealer towards a trade, and then he started with the lies. ‚ÄúWe are going to have to repair 5000 dollars of hail damage before we can sell this vehicle.‚Äù I called BS and told him there was no way they would put 5000 dollars into a car that they would then sell for 9000 dollars. They were going to sell it as-is or put it to auction. He quietly backed off that argument and moved on to why the price of the 370z was a great price. I responded he is getting like 200 dollars off the sticker and that is not a great price. He got sick of hearing me tell him the truth, and handed the phone off to my father without a word while I was still speaking. He managed to get my father mad at me, acting like I was blocking him from the deal of a lifetime. My dad signed everything because he was already fed up with all of it, and angry with me at this point He never got his 1000 dollars off, that was just a lie. It was extremely stupid of him. That is not where my big issue is.
I had to go by yesterday after work, and wait around until somebody would bring me the paperwork to sign, since I had to release the Versa, as I had co-signed it. Nobody would give me the name of the salesperson that sold my father the car. Craig Johnson, a sales manager approached me to attempt to diffuse my anger. I explained the situation to him. He seemed to acknowledge that it was a pretty screwed up deal, however when I asked for the name of the salesperson, he became hesitant. I told him I was going to write a detailed review off this experience, with the name of the salesman. His response staggered me. ‚ÄúCome on man don‚Äôt do that to us.‚Äù I responded that they did not care what they did to my father, he did not care that a discount was never applied, and I do not care what this does for the reputation of the salesman. No employee would give me the name of Stephen Gomez, I had to look on their web page for the sales team.
Initially my review was going to state that if you come to IPAC, try your best to wait for Steve Cotter. He is still a great salesman and I hold a lot of respect for him. Since a sales manager with 15 years experience named Craig Johnson acted as if I was unrightfully angry and nobody was willing to provide me with the name of Stephen Gomez, I would recommend that IPAC be avoided altogether. If a sales manager is that dismissive about its staff screwing people over, the problem does not only lie on the sales floor, there is also a problem in the higher management. If you absolutely have to purchase from here, only go to Steve Cotter. He is a dolphin in a pool of sharks.
I will be taking my Altima to Gunn in 4 months. I wish I could buy from Steve Cotter without having to do it through IPAC (ICRAP)",1.0

117,"February 04, 2015","This place personifies every negative connotation and denotation associated with the purchase of an automobile and car salesmen.  I sent IPAC automobile group an Internet inquiry about a Nissan Altima. One of their salesmen, Alan Henderson, contacted me.  I was originally looking for a pre-owned vehicle with low mileage.  Mr. Henderson stated that he did not have one; however over the phone he said he could sell me a brand new S model for a specific price without financing. When I got there the vehicle which I had requested ‚Äúwas just sold‚Äù.  But he had a very similar model to the one I had inquired about and it was at the same price.  Nonetheless I thought it was a good deal and confirmed that it was the same price; in his office/cubicle he had me sign a piece of paper stating that I would pay the price agreed upon. Five minutes later Mr. Henderson leaves the cubicle and his manager George Ramirez comes into the office/cubicle. At this point Mr. Ramirez decides to raise the price $5000+ and he wanted me to finance the car.  When I mentioned to Mr. Ramirez that Mr. Henderson had quoted a different price over the phone, the manager decided to speak down to me as if I were an idiot, saying ‚Äúyou have no idea what a good deal is.. we are trying to help you‚Äù.  My response was that he does not know me personally, his goal is to sell a car and IPAC is conducting dishonest business.  At that point he gets up angrily and storms out saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not doing business with you.‚Äù  I wasted three hours of my time dealing with this unethical organization. 
So I left and called Anicra Nissan, I asked if the internet advertised price was the correct price.  On Ancira‚Äôs website they clearly posted the costs both with and without financing.  I went in to Ancira met with the salesman, who had the car I spoke to him about ready when I got there.  Test drove the vehicle and had completed the transaction in a matter of two hours. The salesman even, helped me return the rental car I was driving.  The Ancira experience was the complete opposite of the IPAC experience.
Do Not waste your time visiting IPAC auto group they are out right dishonest business people; take your money somewhere else. Take your business somewhere else, certainly consider Ancira Nissan or another organization.

Overall, Louis was friendly, patient, motivated, and overall, a professional with amazing people skills, which is hard to find in employees, its something innate, not taught. Louis is amazing with people, he is truly great at what he does. I'd go to him all over again, thank you.

152,"September 15, 2014","I was very happy with the customer service that was provided by Diego Ayala. I discussed with him on which auto I was interested in. He explained and showed what I wanted to test drive. He was very helpful and paid attention to my auto needs. He made the process very streamline and very enjoyable. Also Nolan Madrid was very helpful in explaining the payment options and understood where we needed to be payment wise since I have a very tight budget. Because of Diego and Nolan, we decided to make the purchase there instead of somewhere else. Mr. Too Tall Martin in Finance was very kind to explain every detail from the purchase and very patient. Very professional  and friendly.
Overall, the purchase experience was very enjoyable and pleasant. I will gladly recommend this dealer ship to everyone I know.",5.0
153,"September 15, 2014","When I first walked into the dealership, I had no plan to really buy a car. I was with my mother as she went to get her car serviced, my mother had mentioned I was thinking of buying a car soon as my '99 Saturn wouldn't last much as I had no AC in it at the time. Nick was very nice and didn't pressure me as we looked at a camry which is what I had considered getting until nick showed me some Nissan's and I fell in love with the Sentra. Nick was very nice and him and George made my 1st time buying a new car very simple and while I stressed a bit about my credit, I was lucky for them to find something that was in my price range to pay and Valerie helped with financing. Valorie was very kind and showed me around the dealership so I would know where to go when it was time to do oil changes and maintenance to the car, she showed me the waiting area and she also gave me the info for my account so I could schedule for any maintenance as well do my oil changes. Overall, It felt like incredible buying a car from here and if I ever buy another car, this would be the 1st place I would and I would recommend all my friends and family to come here. ",5.0

173,"August 13, 2014","Chris Sanmiguel met and took us for the test drives.  We found what we were looking for in color and model.
He was able to locate our choice at another lot.  We had stipulated that we wanted the towing package on our vehicle.  We met with George Ramirez for price negotiation.  After the dance of taking offers to the boss, we agreed to a price and started the closing procedure.  Everything looked good, then George came back and told us they could not give us the tow package as part of the deal.  We had been at the dealership for nearly four hours.  We ate at 6:30 in the morning and it was now approaching 3:00.  We kept saying we needed to go eat something and they said it will be just a few minutes more.  We should have said no deal and walked out for something to eat, but we were worn down and just wanted to finish.  We conceded to the deal and finally got out in time for 5:00 traffic.  We love our vehicle, but a deal is a deal and they agreed to it.  THEY SHOULD HAVE MADE IT GOOD WITH THE TOW PACKAGE.  George went back on a handshaked deal, and that is not the way to do business.

I had gone to several other dealerships who were unable to help including Toyota, Honda, and Mazda. My salesmen Nick and Ron and their manager were not only quick but hustled to get me out of my Altima and into a roomy and super nice Murano which I love! I am very happy with my experience and relieved to have a larger, fuel efficient and new vehicle for me and my family.

PS-I called Gunn Nissan before heading to IPAC and Gunn was very rude. They were not helpful with my questions, said it would be very difficult to get out of my Altima but could ""go in anyway if I wanted to"". They also said that they would ""not give any additional discounts to help my situations, the price that I see is what I get and everyone pays the same price"".

189,"July 15, 2014","I started in the market of shopping for a truck in early June.  I had my own financing in place and was ready to buy.  Easy, right? Not even close.  I started where I live...Corpus Christi. It was a toss up between the Tacoma and the Frontier.  I went to Nissan first and sat in the top of the line Pro4X with the luxury upgrade. I was hooked. Then I went to Toyota and sat in the Tacoma.  I was like..ehh.  So Frontier it was.  I went back and dealt with the sales person at Nissan Corpus and it ended up being a HUGE waste of time.  There were several hidden prices that were not on the sticker and next thing you know I was looking at a $40k truck. Unreal. They gave me below bottom dollar on my trade in and tacked on an addition $1000 for some 'mandatory' undercoating and locking wheel lugs. Needless to say after 2 hours I walked away with no truck and a salesman who keeps calling my phone. I went through this with an additional 5 dealerships from Houston, San Antonio, Temple, McAllen, and Austin.  I wanted what I wanted and was going to get it.  I ended up on line with IPAC Nissan and within minutes received a call from Alan Henderson.  I informed him of my experiences and he assured me that I would not deal with that from them.  I told him what I wanted (Pro4X with luxury upgrade) and that I'm willing to travel for the right deal.  After nearly a week of contact with Alan and him assuring me that IPAC was the dealership for me, I took a trip up there. And I started this trip expecting to not drive back in a new truck.  I worked the night shift before my trip so only had about 3hrs of sleep so yeah, I showed up a little grumpy. Alan met me in the parking lot and he starting looking at my trade in. I sat in the car with him and told him exactly what I wanted for the trade in value and that we will talk numbers on the truck later.  Long story short...I ended up dealing with Alan Henderson and Sales Manager George Ramirez.  There was absolutely no pressure, minimum (if ANY) haggling, and they even offered me a slightly lower interest rate then what I already had.  I got the truck I wanted, without settling for less, for a price WELL below what the other Nissan dealerships were offering! I then had the pleasure of dealing with Valerie Salazar in Finance.  Once again from the start extremely professional. During the closing she was able to get me an even lower APR! I ended up with 1.5% lower APR than what I walked in with! Unreal.  Another thing...the Frontier Pro4X I wanted was the only one they had on the lot. It was just delivered and still wrapped in plastic.  I didn't even test drive it cause I had been to so many other dealerships before and had driven it repeatedly. That truck was not ready to drive off the lot.  IPAC gave me a rental to bring back to Corpus so they could do their safety inspection on the Pro4X.  The next day Alan took time out of his day and delivered my new truck to me personally.

I recommend seeing and dealing with Alan Henderson to anyone that needs new wheels and does not want to deal with someone BS-ing them.  Y'all will get my business again...

IPAC has the vehicle we want, but the purchase price kept changing, and I'm not sure the USAA rate i was guaranteed was ever met, so I've decided to shop around.

230,"May 20, 2014","I had decided that I wanted a new or nearly new Maxima.  Internet searches led me to IPAC and I found the exact Maxima I wanted: an S model, gunmetal gray with the limited edition upgrade.  The advertised price was near what local dealers wanted for used 2013 models.  I decided that I didn't need to test drive the Maximas IPAC listed since I was familiar the 2013 model and learned through research that the 2014 model is virtually the same.  Nevertheless I remained stressed over buying a vehicle ""sight unseen"" 500 miles away.  I had decided to finance the vehicle through my local bank and so I was essentially purchasing the vehicle without ever seeing it in person.  I worried that I would fly into San Antonio only to learn that ""my"" Maxima was different than the one I bargained for.  Luis Rivera and Craig Doyle assured me over the phone that the Maxima listed was exactly the one I was buying.  I took the leap.  When Craig met me at the airport in my new car I was relieved to see that it was exactly what I'd bargained for.  Once at the dealership, the staff was professional, courteous, and helpful.  I drove away feeling as though I had engaged in a mutually beneficial transaction.  I'm extremely pleased with the car, and feel as though I saved quite a bit over what I would have paid locally.  I have no reservations recommending IPAC to others.   ",4.6

234,"May 16, 2014","I was very frustrated with my experience at this dealership. I had initially come in on a Sunday and was told that they didn't have the exact car we wanted in stock. About 3 days later I went to a car selling website and submitted my information. I immediately was contacted by Jeremiah Gonzalez. He was very friendly over the phone. I told him my expectations of the vehicle we'd like and also specified that I'd provide my own financing. He started to search for that perfect vehicle and proceeded it find it. The car was the perfect color and had the exact features I was searching for. I was very surprised that he had the car in stock when 3 days earlier they did not have it. He then QUOTED me a price which seemed to meet my budget. I then told him I'd call him back. I spoke with my family about this car, the price, and the dealership. They seemed to agree, so then I called him back AGAIN. I, once again told him about the price which he quoted to me over the phone. I told him I'd be there in about 30 minutes and he replied saying that he'd be waiting for me and that he was looking forward to working with me. He even asked what car I'd be pulling up in! 

When my father and I showed ip to the dealership. We weren't greeted immediately and WE had to walk to the receptionist to find Jeremiah. I was then told Jeremiah went on a ""Lunch Meeting"" (Keep in mind it was 4:00 PM). So now I had to work with another sales person. I was pretty upset, because if Jeremiah was going to bail, he should have said so in the first place. 

So Manny Zamora then proceeded to show us the car that Jeremiah had picked out. To my dismay it was NOT the car Jeremiah promised me over the phone. It was a completely different color and had some mileage on it. My father and I were VERY disappointed at this point. Manny was SUPER patient with us and had a very calming affect. He listened to ALL of our concerns and spoke to us very politely. 

Manny then went on to bring Jimmy Foster into the picture. Jimmy was the sales manager on the floor. He also patiently listened to our concerns and was pretty surprised at the fact that Jeremiah had quoted a price over the phone. He managed to find a car that met our criteria (although it wasn't the exact color we wanted). For the next few hours we went back and forth about price. I was very upset when I was told that there had been a miscommunication about the price and that the the car was in fact $3000-$4000 more expensive than what was quoted. My father and I walked out the door super upset about the entire situation and just very frustrated. 

My father and I then talked over our finances and saw that we could work with the price they had come down to. We also appreciated the fact that Jimmy and Manny worked so hard in trying to provide us the quality service that Jeremiah failed to do. So we went back to the dealership and bought the car. 

It must have been about 8:00 PM by the time we finished signing paperwork and to my surprise Jeremiah had STILL not shown up. I didn't realize that a ""Lunch Meeting"" could take 4 hours. He ended up never showing up or apologizing. As someone who's grown up around sales, Jeremiah Gonzalez was VERY unprofessional and provided poor service. 

On the upside, we love the car we bought and have been enjoying driving it. Manny Zamora and Jimmy Foster represented quality service and I would recommend folks to go in and speak to these two gentlemen. ",3.8

240,"May 11, 2014","From the moment I arrived to the dealership, I was treated very kindly. I arrived on a bicycle and was Immediately assisted by Latzu Lara. He made the entire experience easy. This was my first time buying a new car and I was treated as a person and not as a ""sale"". Latzu answered all my question about the car I decided on, a Nissan Versa Sedan SV, prior to arriving at the dealership. Once all the paper work was finished, I was to return the next day to pick up my car. Latzu drove me home on the South Side so as not to take the bus and he even picked me up from my work the next day when my car was ready. The only unfortunate part of this experience was the matter of the car's color. I was focused on buying one of 3 colors; blue, black, or red, but none were available for the model I selected. But, that will still not deter my 5 star service I received. The finance manager, Mr. Daniel ""Too Tall"" Martin was determined to assist me in getting the payments I was looking for. He managed to keep them overall around the highest amount I was willing to pay a month. I will definitely recommend this dealership and Mr. Lara to anyone I know who is looking for a new car.",5.0

The finance guy said yes, Im good to go enjoy your car. So monday I am getting calls saying they are going to run my fathers credit again.  For what? I dont know or am I  happy about that. The car is under my name only. So running my fathers credit was not right. The person on the phone said they had to, as if I didnt have a choice.

Only to be called back once agin and to my shock my payment is more, intrest rate is more, and term is shorter.   The finance guy that called me back said ""its not a big deal its only 20 bucks.""  Well thats not what was talked about friday, my rate and least term where all different Friday. I said well I guess Ill take the car back to you guys then. Only then did he say let me see what he can do. Then calls me back with the same payment info, but not the same rate.  He once again says""its not a big deal. Its onlt a .10 of a point.

I think that this is poor salesmanship and I can't recommened anyone anyone to face similar  such embarssment and disappointment.  In the future if other customers face similar type situations at least afford them at the very least privacy while pulling the rug from under their feet.

The height of the car was very important because of my back. My grandson did the research for me
since I don't really understand cars much.  I just didn't want a 'tuna can' with wheels.
I came in thinking I wanted one car but decided on another because he took his time.
I love my car- very comfortable and very responsive.  Love the seat belt height adjustment.
So much more comfortable.

I was quoted for a job at a price, however, they ran into complications and couldn't fix it...I was then charged for something that really didn't fix the problem and had pay to tow my vehicle away unrepaired.  When people are not HONEST and take advantage of a disabled Vet, then there's a problem. They stated that ""they gave me a break, but that I couldn't expect to go into a dealership with a car with problems and not pay anything"".  I don't mind paying for something that is warranted, but I do have a problem when I'm being charged for work that will not contribute to resolving the problem or if I perceive that I'm being deceived and/or misinformed.  There were numerous times when I had called and left messages and was not called back, I was even put on hold for so long, that it would then go to a voice mail.

306,"October 01, 2013","Very dishonest car lot. Nightmare of an experience.

My wife and I went to purchase a car, and they told us we had financing and were approved, but just needed to get the car detailed. We were given a rental and told to come back with income verification documents and we could pick the car up the next day. Our vehicle which we were trading in, was driven off, and we were excited to be getting a new car.

Fast forward: because of her income being mainly self-employed income it was difficult to verify (cash based) and the financing didnt go through.  I called for a week trying to get our vehicle back and the Director (Jason Miranda) told us we had a deal and we lied about our income, they were going to keep searching for a lender. I found out later they ran my credit 20+ times, dropping my score from the mid  6's to the the high 5's!

They still wouldn't give my our vehicle despite going up there and multiple calls each day.
I kept getting told, ""the lender only needs this, or that."", I didn't realize that they were still submitting our credit application to lenders all over the world!

10 days later, the salesman called and told me that all of the financing attempts failed, and they were pulling our car around front and to come get it.

I told them, look I was in the middle of a few things and that I'd try to make it that night but if not then first thing in the morning and that I had been trying to get my vehicle for over a week and it obviously wasn't a huge priority to them, and so I'd make it as soon as I could.

Jason Miranda, (the Director) called back and told me that if I wasn't in there by the hour, that he was calling the police and saying we stole their car, and then he'd use the vehicle recovery system to shut it off and leave us stranded! He talked down to me so severely and wouldn't give me a chance to speak, that I just hung up.   -All this after I had called him for nearly 3 days in a row straight and he wouldn't take my calls, or return them!

I called the police due to his threat to report me a car thief and I was worried that I'd be stranded and reported, but they advised me what to do.

When i arrived at the dealership, I called the office and told the receptionist that I was outside with the rental. Jason came busting out of the office aggressively and started yelling about how we stole their car and filled out a false financial application, while we were nose to nose, and about 20 salesmen crowded around like a gang. 

I did not handle the situation perfectly, but after be threatened to be stranded and arrested after everything that happened I believe my anger was justified.

We filed a police report, and we were told that this wasn't the first incident with this dealership.

As a side note, George Ramirez, Jeremiah Gonzalez, Joe Flores and Shaun Rice were all descent staff and I have no qualms with them.
But since the Jason Miranda is their boss, the negativity rolls down hill. It's obvious that he cares more about sales quotas then the customer or the employees and that feeling is tangible, The employees do not look happy they seem scared.

The next day we got approved for a brand new 2013 vehicle with a low interest rate, so I'm still confused as to what the issue was...

Be careful, We warned, read the details carefully if you decide to go with them.
Try to get financing before you even show up to the lot.  

I would go with Gunn or CarMax if at all possible. I have no relation with any of them, but I've had good experiences with those dealers in the past.",1.5

We had a vehicle in mind and we had discuss a vehicle by internet and received a price for that vehicle, so we were expecting that particular vehicle.  When we arrive they told us that that particular vehicle was not available and so we went for the second choice they send us by internet services and the copy of that same advertisement, but they told us that they were not able to respect the price given on the advertisement because we did not qualify for that price due to our credit.  So we had to keep that second choice but with a different price, and the reason for staying with that price is because my husband was not feeling fine and we just wanted to get out of there.  In my opinion,  we did not got the advertise price for the vehicle and that is call false advertisement!  A dealer should not advertise a price if they are not going to respect it !!!",2.2
344,"July 12, 2013","I had been searching for a mid size truck and IPAC had the best pricing on the net.  I saw the vehicle on your web site and contacted Dale S., who invited me in to look at the truck and take a test drive.  Upon arrival he then immediately passed me to Omar G. to take the test drive.  I really liked the truck and was very happy to find a vehicle that exceeded my expectations.  Omar was very upbeat and friendly.  I became even more excited about buying the vehicle with IPAC.
Everything went south after that.  An offer was given by Jimmy F. that was more than just insulting.  I thought this was part of the process and expected a more reasonable negotiation process.  I showed I had pre-approval for the purchase amount of the truck from USAA.  I was in your facility for 5-1/2 hours.  I was given a bottle of water only after requesting it.  As a Diabetic I think your strategy of making customers wait until they are hungry enough to give in is some of the worst sales tactics I have ever encountered.  I am surprised you don‚Äôt make your sales associates wear white shoes and belts to resemble the 70‚Äôs style of sales Mr. Benson utilizes to get the most money from your customers.
I was so very hungry and not feeling very well from what I am guessing was my low glucose levels.  I arrived to the dealership before 5 pm and did not leave until 10:30 pm.  I had not eaten since noon.  I would have made a more wise decision had I left to have dinner and returned.  However, once your car is taken for evaluation, your keys disappear and you must now wait at a simple desk and table with nobody around.  I finally gave in and informed James I would not exceed a given amount for the truck.  I will add that I said I was paying more than I should be paying.  I was lastly sent to see Valerie S. who proceeded to show me an amount exceeding what I had just said was my tipping point.
After expressing my extreme displeasure with your dealership personnel and I did not want to proceed and just wanted to leave.  Valerie asked that I wait yet again and returned with a lowered amount.  She then offered me some of her cookies from a snack bag she had in her drawer [I was very thankful for the offer and ate a few of the cookies].  I told her I did not want to buy anything else but she continued and eventually sold me GAP insurance I kept denying.  I left with a truck I am very happy to drive at a price I am not comfortable paying, from a dealership I will discourage anyone from going to.  I will not buy another vehicle form a Benson dealership and will likely return to McCombs or Gunn dealership in the future.  When I contacted USAA for a pre-approved loan, my name was given to Gunn, World Car and Ancira.  Those dealerships did contact me but IPAC had the truck I wanted.  I do not think it was a coincidence that IPAC was NOT one of the dealerships given my name by USAA.  A clear warning I did not adhere to.  I will say again, Omar was very good and I was happy to deal with him.  Anyone who asks about my truck will continue to hear how much I like the Nissan brand and what I had to endure to acquire it.  I am a department head at a local hotel and I intend to use this negative experience to train on poor customer service and how some businesses will do whatever it takes with total disregard for the customer.  If I thought going to the BBB would accomplish something, they would be the next e-mail I would send.  The experience of sitting in your dealership for all those hours left me with an extremely bad taste for the car buying process with Benson dealerships.

348,"July 04, 2013","First off I would like to say how refreshing it is to have a sales person like Dean to assist me on my purchase of my new car.  This is my 1st new car purchase, and it was a great experience.  I was given about 5 mins to look at the cars, then he strolled back over and started figuring out what i wanted.  Then he drove me around 2 sections of different cars, showing different options and packages the whole time not being too pushy, but also giving great tips.  He knew all his product and different packages.  One thing I like in a sales person is to ""ACT LIKE YOU HAVE BEEN THERE BEFORE""  not some 20 yr old that bought his first set of ties and slacks for the week, or some old guy saying ""we are here for you"" (which i did see in the office right next to us)  Dean was a VERY professional, well put together, and respectful SALES PERSON that your company is luck to have.  I have been to IPAC NISSAN several times in the past when my brother and sister have bought cars, and they had very DIFFERENT experiences purchasing vehicles.  I will say that i looked online before I went in, and IPAC had the cheapest prices around, and that is the reason i chose IPAC( and its closest to my house).  I would recommend DEAN to anyone I know that is looking for a new vehicle.

Thanks DEAN, you changed my feelings towards CAR SALESMAN!

357,"June 21, 2013","I was recently in a pretty bad car accident and needed to purchase a new vehicle.  I drove a Mini Cooper S for 7 years and LOVED my car but it did not survive the car wreck.  I had read online that the Juke drove pretty comparable to a Mini but for a lot less money and thought I would give it a chance.  I knew Nissans were good, quality, vehicles because my father sold them for several years.  The day I went to IPAC it was raining outside.  I had explained to Jeremiah I was recently in a car accident (had the bandage on my hand to prove it) and he took the time to go over all of the safety features the Juke had to offer while not compromising the handling of the vehicle.  Even though it was raining he we test drove the car on the highway and in an empty parking to make some tight donuts lot to show how the car would handle in adverse weather.  I wasn't quite ready to buy a car that night but did go back the next day when it wasn't raining and the sun was out to buy the Juke.  That day George had Mike Rodriguez help since Jeremiah had several customers.  Jeremiah still would check on me to make sure everything was going well.  Once I had decided on the Juke I wanted to purchase George made sure I received the best pricing available.  I discovered after leaving the dealership I qualified for invoice pricing through my employer and George was able to adjust the price of the Juke and get me back the difference from what I had originally paid.

While in the finance office Valerie took really good care of me.  She could see some of the hesitation I had was able to get me a price on the warranties that fit my budget.  She also understood I was worried after being in a car accident and moving to a new city financial concerns I had and did a great job in getting the monthly payments of the Juke to where I was comfortable. She was extremely patient with me and I greatly appreciate that!

Mike was fun to work with and always had plenty of jokes throughout the process.  Realizing I live out of town he gave me several options to pick up my final paperwork and extra key for the Juke.

I was not looking forward to replacing my car and was not in the market for a vehicle at the time of my purchase.  Jeremiah and the team at IPAC made an event I was not looking forward to an enjoyable experience.  I would recommend friends and family to purchase from IPAC in the future.

382,"May 02, 2013","I started out with IPAC Mazda.  Humberto was helping me through all my decisions and it was a pleasure to not feel pressured by a salesman.  When i decided to go to a new Nissan, I had to switch dealerships since i was now going with a new Vehicle.  My car selection process was extensive and Humberto was patient throughout the entire time.  When i decided to go with a new Nissan Versa, i realized that Humberto would not be able to sell the car from the sister dealership.  He walked me to the Nissan side and at that time noone was available to assist me.  He stayed with me, working with the Managers of the Nissan place.  Then Craig Johnson came to me and asked what it was that i needed them to do to get the deal done.  I told him, he said ""Okay"".  He walked away, then about 10 minutes later, he was back and told me everything i asked for, I got.  I chose to come back the next day because it was very late at this time.  Shaun Rice then gave me a Loaner car so i could leave my trade there.  The next day, i came in and after a small wait, i was back in the finance dept. where i met Jason Swindle.  The finance part went great and Jason even made my wife comfortable (who never likes to be in the financial end of things).  I was then given a tour of my new car, which i have never experienced before.  At this point i noticed a few concerns with the window tint.  Shaun was fast to say they will fix it and even made me an appointment.  Throughout all of this, Craig, Shaun, Jason and Humberto greeted me, talked with me, and just plain made me feel comfortable.

387,"April 22, 2013","I have been tracking Nissan Altimas for two years through Consumer Reports.  I finally decided to obtain one, so I contacted IPAC through the internet sales department.  I got an automated response within 5 minutes, and then a personal response from Dale shortly thereafter.  I agreed to come to the dealership the next day after explaining my purpose in trading for an Altima 2.5.  Upon arrival, Mike Rodriguez greeted my wife and me warmly, helped us meet up with Dale, and then Dale had Mike take over the sales process.  We test drove the vehicle after a brief systems introduction, and then came back to the dealership to begin the paperwork.

Mike did some preliminary papers on our trade-in payoff and our financial application.  Once our credit score came in and our payoff balance was established, Mike turned us over to Shawn.  After several minutes of give-and-take to reach an acceptable payment level, we arrived at an agreement.  Next, we went to the financial documents preparation station, where a customer care rep (nice woman, but I don't recall her name) met with us before our time with the document preparer.  Since one document preparer was new and running behind, another jumped in to conclude our purchase process.  We were treated exceptionally well by all personnel.

Our only dissatisfaction/concern had to do with pricing.  We came in to buy a vehilcle priced on the internet at under $20K, but the paperwork was drawn up at $21.5K.  When I asked why, Shawn stated that the paperwork price included dealer prep costs of nearly $1500 (some of which I wouldn't have chosen). We weren't expecting that...!  We feel that the advertised price on the internet should be the final sales price, except for the addition of TTL fees.  

It was nearly a deal-breaker --- especially since our trade-in allowance was very, very low.  Granted, we brought in a 1996 Infinite J30, but it had very low mileage and a pristine leather interior with Bose stereo system.  We purchased it for $4K a month ago, and just spent $1100 more this week redoing engine seals with a tune-up.  To be offered only $500, plus another $500 for this quality, low mileage vehicle, was unbelievable and sobering (insulting...?).  I turned it over with some buyer remorse because Infinitis are expensive to maintain, but we figured it worth much more than $1K.  We discussed this with Shawn, and eventually we were conceded $2K.  

So, between the unexpected dealer prep cost additions and the low trade-in allowance, we were almost ready to walk out the door.  In the end, though, Shawn got the payment near our acceptable budget provision, and the car quality itself brought the sale to conclusion. 

Thank you!

There was no 'dreaded' hard slamming 'sales approach'. Rather, it was an attitude and experience of 'I am here to help you find what you
are looking for'. Discounts initially quoted on certain vehicles were honored and there was no pressure from the dealership to push what they
wanted to sell versus what we wanted to buy.

My daughter was very happy with the car that she leased.  It has so many options that I know she will take advantage of.  The new car gives me piece of mind that she will be safer on the road.

405,"December 30, 2012","Went to purchase a vehicle last night. Spoke with someone on the phone, Craig head of internet sales. Had money in hand and we were ready to buy. Craig was aware and gave us a drive out price of 22,218. We get there and Addam the Sales Manager comes in and says because we are not financing through Nissan that that wouldn't be the price. The price would be more. I said that Craig was aware we had money in hand ready to buy and gave us that price. Addam went to his boss (Name I don't remember) and came back and said could we go up $500 more. I said ok $500. We have a deal. He then comes back after speaking with his boss again and says no can do it has to be $1000. I was outraged and said I would walk. He said can you do 22,900. I said yes we all shook and he left again. They then came into start the paper work. Adam returns and says, no they can't do 22,900. We get up and walk out. They chase us down in the parking lot and belittle us over $300. Quote from the Finance Manager, ""Are you really going to let $300 ruin a deal?"" My reply, ""No sir you are. And it's not about the money it's about the principal."" I will never shop here again. I will never tell anyone in my family to shop here for a new vehicle.And first thing tomorrow morning I will be calling Nissan to let them know my displeasure.",1.8

407,"December 05, 2012","I was sold a Horrible Vehicle which is a 2010 Nissan Rouge. This car looses power when taken out of town or at a long distance and would also over heat. I have taken the vehicle to the service department four times for repair but they never fix the issue. The service department gives me the run around and they do not fully check into the issue. One employee told me they might have to do a recall on my nissan and informed me to drive it until the check engine light comes on. Well I did that and then and they refused to cover the damage. They told me the radiator was damaged and would cost $700.00 to fix. I had to have it towed to a radiator shop. When the car arrrived the radiator shop said my engine was blown out also. When I asked them why they didnt tell me it was the engine too they told me that they didnt check it, they ASSUMED it was only a radiator. Not to mention the radiator shop informed me that they were over charging me by $500.00. They still refused to cover the damage. This car has had so many issues with it and it is only a 2010. DO NOT BUY FROM NISSAN!!! Horrible cars horrible service from the service department. I was also spoken to very disrespectfully by the employees. They actually had me crying on the phone because they were so rude to me. I have had the worst sservice and treatment here at Nissan and I will NEVER buy a nissan vehicle from them again in my life.

But the most annoying, ignorant, and unprofessional service we have ever received in automotive service was dealing with Valerie which was just enough to never go back to Ingram Park Nissan even though I am in the market to purchase a new vehicle . I'd rather drive further and out of my way to avoid such crap of service.

417,"October 12, 2012","So I have previousy posted a review on here for the first situation I expierced with ipac Nissan which was

 ‚ÄúMy sister and i went into ipac nissan on monday 9/10/12, in the hopes of looking for a car. I explained to her that i don't need anything fancy, i just needed something affordable, good on gas, and is reliable because i got promoted at my job, and it requires me to drive around town alot. We went into the dealership spoke with Mr. angel Villafuerte. I explained to him, that i need something no higher than $14,000 doesnt even have to be new, it could of been used that would of been fine with me, with a monthly payment of no higher than $300. i'm a first time buyer, my credit was descent, i didn't have money to put down upfront, and my income wasn't all that much. I also told him i do not want to see any cars until, i know if and how much i was qualified for, because i didn't want to fall in love with a car that i knew i couldn't afford. He was very nice, took my information we went and looked at some used Nissan Sentra's which were very nice, and seemed in my price range. We came back in and Mr. Adam came in and told us he ran mine and my sisters credit co-signing together. He then told me we qualified to get a brand new Sentra, i wouldn't have to put anything down, because the bank was offering a $2500 rebate that could be used as my down payment, and he said he will work something out so that i can get my payment under $300. I was stoked, but we had to go to work shortly after that, so i explained to Mr. Adam that we would have to come back another day. He said that would be fine he'll hold our information. So last night Monday 9/17/12 we went back to try to finalize what he told us. We then get transfered to another sales man named Ron Rios i believe. He was about the only person that actually tried to help us. I tried telling him to look at the paperwork first before we see any cars, but he said that he already knew what we qualified for. He takes us to go look at cars, i FELL IN LOVE with a brand new silver sentra. I took a test drive, and loved everything about it. So we go back and sit down, and then Jimmy Foster(who had the worst attitude towards us at the end) came in and said there is no way we could afford the car because it would be about $21,000 or so. He told me the only way we could get the car is if our payments were like at $450 for 72 months. I tried telling him thats not what adam was telling us. i couldn't afford that. Then he told us, well there's nothing we can do. I tried explaining to him, that was the reason why i was so excited. i didnt want to see any cars, cause i wanted to avoid falling in love with a car, and then being told it's too much. I told him, i dont even need a brand new car, i would be ok with a used car thats cheaper, but he had no care of trying to help us out, and just told us basically (too bad). I felt so embarrased, frustrated, and immediately started crying as we were walking out the dealership, i have never felt so devasted, because there is no doubt that i need a better car, and he just made me feel as if im screwed and wont ever be able to afford any type of car. This was the first dealership that i went to , and my whole family has nissans thats why even more so i wanted to go there. Now i feel so discouraged about trying to look somewhere cause i feel the salesman are going to be just as rude, and un-helpful. I would reccomend this dealership, just not Adam for not telling us one thing, and then the dealership saying another, and Jimmy Foster. His attitude was horrible, and you could tell he had the attitude that he had no care in the world if we get a car or not. ‚Äú 

The second experience I had with them was just as un-productive as the first. When I wrote the first review on  9/18/2012, I immediately received an email from the internet sales manager, Rob Malanowski. We wrote back a couple of times, he told me the only way we can move forward is if I find another co-signer. So I did find another co-signer which was my dad. I tried and tried to get ahold of rob on the phone, left countless numbers of messages because every time I tried to get ahold of him he never answered, until I got transferred to Dale Stehle who does interent sales. We spoke and I told him I had another co-signer, so he emailed me the credit application on Tuesday 9/25/12 which I filled out when I got out of work and faxed to him. Of course it was late, so I got ahold of him Wednesday morning 9/26/12 and I told him I was going to go in there personally to see what the next step was, because I was really interested in a silver 2011 nissan sentra for $13,895. I got there about 9:00 am, spoke immediately with dale, he processed the application and asked if I wanted to test drive the car, so my boyfriend and I went outside to see it, and I caught a glance of a 2011 blue Nissan sentra SR, which I immediately fell in love with, but it didn‚Äôt have the price on it. I told dale along with angel villafuerte who was the saleman helping us, that I wanted to switch the silver car for the blue car. So they did, got the information, never told me the actual price of the vehicle,  after waiting about 30 minutes, the sales director Jason Miranda came out and told us that we got a bank that was willing to proceed with the loan on the car for me. He then told me that my payments were going to be $351(which was not what I wanted, because I asked to not have a payment over $320) and Jason said there was no way the payment could be lower, I asked him what the price of the blue sentra was, and he said he didn‚Äôt know but it should be about the same as the silver sentra,  and  since im a ‚Äúfirst time buyer‚Äù  the bank is requiring me to put a minimum of $1400.00 down. I asked Jason, why and he said because the bank needs to see an investment in me, that way they feel more comfortable with them financing with me. So I called around, and fortunately was able to find the money required from the bank. I told Jason and he gave me a list of all the other requirements, like proof of income, and residence. Fortunatly I had my pay stubs on hand, and since my dad is self employed I had his c11 tax form on hand. So we gave Jason the information that we had. He then came back and said it needed to be signed by my dad, because I had provided the copy of the tax return. He also said the the bank requires that the tax form needs to be ‚Äúsigned by a professional tax preparer‚Äù. I explained to Jason that we do our own taxes at home, because my mom is a licensed tax preparer, and she has the software at home, we do this every year. He then said he was going to get ahold of a certain gentlemen who works at the bank that I was dealing with, to ask if my mom‚Äôs signature with PTIN number was acceptable. At that time we had been waiting since 9:00 am and it was already 1:30pm, and since I currently didn‚Äôt have a vehicle I had to borrow my boyfriends, I tried telling angel as well as Jason in the morning, that we had to leave at least by 1:00pm so that I had time to drop off my boyfriend and make it in time for work by 2:00pm. So we pretty much waited a total of 4 hours, just sitting there, waiting for Jason to get ahold of the bank, and everytime that I looked over to him, he was either yelling at the sales managers, or working on it seemed like other salesman‚Äôs work. Which I understand his situation, because he is the director and its a lot of responsibility, to deal with multiple deals. So we patiently waited until angel said that Jason wasn‚Äôt able to get ahold of the banker at that time, so we would have to come back. Before we left though angel took us to the finance manager EJ, so at that time it was already 1:40pm and we really had to go. Finally 5 minutes later, he called us to the back, and had us sign papers I guess to take the car off of the market. All he did was highlight what needed to be signed, he didn‚Äôt explain not one thing on that paper. I know that your always supposed to read before you sign anything but Me being a first time buyer just that I was signing that I was dedicated to getting that car. So we leave, and inform angel that we will be back after I get out of work. Jason had said that while I was at work he would get ahold of the bank. So we leave EXTREMELY late for work. Then later after work go back, hopefully knowing the bottom line of the tax form signature information. Which has given Jason 5 hours to get ahold of somebody. We come back ask the receptionist to speak with angel or Jason. She says they will be with us in a second. So we sit down , and my dad came with us as well. I was trying to tell them to be fast because my dad needed to hurry up and go back to work,  we sat there and waited 2 hours, without anybody coming to help us. I can clearly see Jason in his office, im assuming he was working on other work. Then jimmy foster one of the sales managers comes to us, and says that Jason wasn‚Äôt able to get ahold of the bank because there already closed. I was so frustrated, this was my 4th trip back to the dealership with no production what so ever. So I asked why he couldn‚Äôt get ahold of the bank if he clearly had several hours while they were open. He didn‚Äôt really answer my question.  My boyfriends dad also showed up to see the car, and was asking jimmy what the price of the actual car was, since nobody told me, and so he bring out the form that I signed with EJ the finance manager, and the price was on there that he failed to explain to me, It was I believe $14,895. Which I didn‚Äôt mind the price change because I really loved the car. So since the bank was closed, Jason obviously didn‚Äôt help us, and jimmy looked liked he wanted to leave already because everytime I saw him he was on his phone. So I told jimmy to tell Jason that we will be back tomorrow in the morning to see what Jason said the bank told him. So we came back Thursday, 9/27/12 at about 9:30am  sat there and waited for another hour and half without anyone offering to help, we even clearly heard and saw two employees who were sales manager James Ozuna and another sales manager Adam who were cussing, screaming, very loudly that all the customers in the building were turning their heads and listening and watching while these men were clearly arguing, along with other employees who were watching and some were even laughing at the situation that was going on between them. That in itself is VERY un-professional., So  finally jimmy saw us sitting there and asked if we‚Äôve been helped, I told him no, I was waiting for Jason, so he told Jason and he came out and said, that the bank said it is required that the tax form be signed by a ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù  that was the only way we could proceed with the deal, I tried telling Jason why the hell would we go and pay to have someone to do our taxes when my mom is professionally licensed to sign them. He said the only other option Is I have is to get another co-signer, which I was out of people at that point. So I told Jason that if there was any way after I get out of work if I can try to find a ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù tax preparer to sign the document if that was ok. He said yes, that would be fine. So I‚Äôm at work and I have a missed call from the dealership with no voicemail, so I call back the receptionist said there is no way to trace a outgoing phone call, so I asked to just speak with angel. She transfers me and I get on the phone with angel, he says that Jason was calling to see if the deal was still on or not. I told him, I was still at work and was still trying to figure out who could sign the papers. So angel says ‚Äúok so I tell him no?‚Äù I told him I didn‚Äôt know what to do at that point, because it seemed like Jason didn‚Äôt care about the deal enough to give me some more time to find a solution. So I tell angel, well I mean if theres nothing I can do right now, then I don‚Äôt know what to tell you. His response was ‚Äúok ill tell him you said no, bye‚Äù I was very offended by the way he seemed along with ever person ive dealt with these past 3 weeks like they didn‚Äôt care about helping me, or trying to make this deal work. So I then called my mom, and explained the whole situation. She was furious and said whenever I got out of work she was going to go down there and try to clear things up, I personally didn‚Äôt want to go back and deal with anybody else from that dealership again, but I had no choice because they still had all my original documents. So we arrive about 7:00pm Of course with my luck Jason wasn‚Äôt there so my mom spoke with angel. Angel said there was nothing he can do, so he got Shaun Rice a sales manager to come and talk to us. He at first seemed like he wanted to help, but my mom was trying to explain to him that she doesn‚Äôt understand why the bank is just now requiring this form to be signed, when in the past she has gotten several vehicles from that other dealerships and including one vehicle form IPAC, with that same C11 form, with no problems before, but now they want to make a requirement like that, when it is an official document signed by a licensed preparer. Shaun said, ill be right back im going to go get your file and see where we stand right now. So we wait about 15 minutes, and we turn around and see shaun going to sit down with another customer, so I figured he was helping them first so we would have to wait AGAIN! We waited for 30 minutes, and he NEVER not once looked this way to come and help us, so my mom went and asked another gentlemen if she could speak with someone else since Shaun obviously wasn‚Äôt interested in helping us. So jimmy comes with our file and hands me back all my original paperwork. Not once did any one of the men that I spoke to apologized for the amount of time and stress I have had over all the running around they made me do throughout this whole time or even offered any other help. Even shaun saw us walking out and didn‚Äôt even try to tell us sorry for making us wait, or even have a good night. Nothing was accomplished except the fact that this dealership made me wait this whole week, with no vehicle, and no solutions, no sympathy for the previous situation that I dealt with or even showing anytype of customer service. So now I am still without a vehicle, going to have to start this search all over again, going to have to have my credit score drop again, and going to have to try to go to another dealership with this horrible first time car buying experience in the back of my head. I am very disappointed in the entire dealership and all the un-professional salesman, managers, and directors that I dealt with. I hope that something gets done about this, and I would never recommend this dealership to anyone I know, because it is not worth there time and effort, when the dealership has no care of getting you into a car. This review is definitely going to be put on the better business bureau, so that hopefully other people can see this and take my advice to not go there!

425,"September 10, 2012","Beware!
The Internet Price is not the price they start out with.  They revert back to the MSRP even though the internet price is much lower.  The LOW internet price is just to lure you in.  We drove 3 hours with the impression that we would deal with the internet dept. and not have to sit and deal with a salesman for 2+ hours.  The dealership also puts a manager in the cubical next to the one you are in to &quot;spy&quot; on what is going on.  If you have never been to the dealership you are led to believe that the person is just another salesman. I asked if we were being spied on and the answer was a nod yes.  After insisting on the internet price (taking 1 1/2 hours just to do this) the dealership finally agreed to the internet price.  We ended up walking out without the vehicle - did not like how they lured us in - 
We also walked out because they insulted me by offering such a low amount on my trade.  Yes, it had high mileage, but I feel the dealership was trying to make up for their &quot;loss&quot; on having to agree to the internet price.  

My dissapointment is that the dealership lures you in expecting the internet price when they have no intention of letting the vehicle go for that price.

In our case, I feel that the dealership only agreed to the internet price because I was going to give them this review, plus I am contacting TV/Radio Stations to see if anyone else has had this problem.

Lewis was very nice, only doing his job, but the overall practice of this dealership makes me cringe.  If you advertise a price, that is the price you should start out dealing with once arriving at the dealership.  You should not have to work for over one and a half hours to get back to this number.",1.5

429,"August 31, 2012","John was very friendly and helpful.  He was able to find us a vehicle, that meets our needs.  He was a bit pushy, but what car salesman isn't?  Shaun was also friendly, but he is what caused us to have a bad experience.  I had been pre-approved through my bank for a loan to more than cover the purchase.  John and Shaun asked if I would use their financing if they could get a better rate, I said yes.  Shaun worked out the numbers and came up with a price that was agreeable.  We signed all of the paperwork and took the car home.  However, they could not line up financing to meet the numbers they offered and we all agreed to.  So, two days later, they asked me to bring in the paperwork from my bank.  When I did, Shaun raised the price of the car!  He explained this as ""your bank says it has to be 110% of the list price.""  This is not correct.  I showed him that that is the MAXIMUM they would allow; they will not finance $100,000 for a vehicle that is only worth $20,000.  After re-explaining this a couple times, he admitted that because we did not use his financing, he does not make the profits he would have made if we did, so he had to raise the price so they could still make money.  I should have walked away.  I did not and regret it to this day (a week and a half later).  The increase did not affect the payment too much,  they already had my trade-in, and we already had been driving the car for 2 days, so we decided to just finish the deal; however, we will not be returning to this dealership and DO NOT recommend it to anyone.",2.8

440,"July 13, 2012","The Titan is my fourth Nissan vehicle: 1981 Datsun/Nissan 810 Maxima; 1985 300ZX, 2006 Infiniti G35.  My previous 3 were great cars with next to no repair costs needed for any them. Over a 100,000 miles on each of the first two with one $100 fan clutch needed - no other costs that were outside of maintenance.  The G35 is going on 7 years with a single repair. 

I am very happy with the Titan price from Ingram Park Nissan which was by far the best of any San Antonio dealer. I contacted them all asking by email for bids on what I wanted. Basically they sold me an SV for what other dealers wanted for an plain S on sale.

Did not think that we were going to buy that car. I asked about it and he gave us the information.  We liked the way the car drove. It was a beautiful Blue 2009 Nissan Altima 2.5 with low milage in great condition and we bought it. This was meant to be. If we had waited, somebody else would have bought our car.

In fact, we were so elated that within 24 hours of our purchase we had already recommended Ingram Park Nissan to family members who live even further than we do from the dealership.

466,"June 25, 2011","The service was great since the time i showed up to the time i left.  I was greeted with a friendly handshake at the door by one of your sales reps and was escorted directly to the person i had originally made contact with over the internet.  I really appreciated the genuine friendliness from Darren Washington who helped me out throughout the sale.  I feel i got a great price for a great car.  I really do.  My family and friends tell me that im acting like a little kid in a candy store haha.  

The only teeny weeny bit of issue i had with the sale was that while in the lobby area, i was offered a monthly payment of $175.00 and was even asked to initial the price on the paper to which i believed..""ok, this is gonna be the mthly price im going to pay"" so i immediately said, ""yes!!, ill take it."" but then when i was passed on to the finance dpt, i was told that the mthly payment would be two hundred and change.  I did not really appreciate the fact that i was made to sign a price that i actually had to ask for again later with the finance rep.  I felt a little awkward and felt i had to be a little rude the rep and told him..""i just signed a paper saying the payment would be 175.00. Why has this changed just from walking from the lobby to this office?""  The finance rep..i believe his name was Sprice, immediately said...you know hang on..let me fix it. Then he made some changes and gave me the price i had originally been offered.  
Everything after that was great.  Everyone's attitude was very professional and friendly at all times.  
If i had to critic the whole sale, i would say just to be sure that when a price or monthly payment is offered, to follow through exactly as agreed.

468,"June 06, 2011","On May 12 I made an initial phone call & internet inquiry about a Nissan Frontier I was interested in. During my conversation with Pablo Cerna he asked for my phone number so that he could call me back with regards to any inventory he might have on the lot.  About an hour passed and he phoned me stating he didn't have any Nissan Frontiers in my price range, however, he had a Suzuki Equator that was very similar to the Nissan Frontier and that I could get a much cheaper price than a Frontier.  After checkiing the the IPAC website I became interested in the Equator and set up an appointment to drive the vehicle on Saturday May 14, 2011 as we were coming in from Laredo, TX.  On May 14, my wife & I made the 2 hour trip to your lot to test drive the Equator we arrived by 10:45 AM it took nearly 30 minutes to get someone to help us. (So much for a so called appointment) Once Mr. Cerna got to us it was determined that the keys for the Equator were missing/lost. In my opinion if he knew I was coming for an appointment test drive everything should have been ready to go (i.e. the truck keys & the truck was empty on gas and uanble to take for a test drive) I decided after looking at the vehicle it was clean and ready for me to make a deal on the truck.  Of course with the pending approval of a test drive.  After waiting nearly two hours a key was finally cut for the vehicle. While all the waiting I was able to strike a deal for the truck but I had some apprhension due to the high interest rate.  Once in finance I relayed my concern to Bryan Price our finance person about the high interest rate.  He left & came back and said if I purchased the GAP & Extended Warranty it would give him buying power to lower the interste rate.  He couldn't guarantee anything. The intial interest rate was for 17.99% and after negotiating with him and a trip to the sales tower he came down to 15.99%. He stated this would be the highest I would pay on an interest rate (my wife & I signed a contract for 15.99%) healso stated if he was lucky he might be able to lower the interest from 15.99%.  He stated if he got it lower he would have to send Freddy Estrada to laredo to have us sign a new contract. Of course this didn't happen...nearly a week past bye for them to tell me they couldn't get anything lower that in fact the interest rate was going to be at 17.99% as intially quoted and that Freddy Estrada would be coming down for us to sign the new contract. To me these are very shaky business practices at best & I have filed a griveance with the Texas Attorney General's Office & the Better Business Bureau.  To top this entire bad experience off your dealership has yet to pay my vehicle off after nearly a month. It never seems to amaze me that the salesmen were constantly calling me to sell me a car but after I bought the car & need assistnace they never call back.  By the way Mr. Cerna promised me the Keyless Entry Fob that was suppose to come with the truck as advertised by the Dealership & he has yet to phone me & tell me when I can come in for an appointment to program the fob. I can guarntee you I will never recommend any of my family, friends, or business associates from Laredo every purchase a vehicle from this dealership. Im throughly disappointed in the dealerships lack of Customer Service & business practices. My vehicle that I traded in needs to be paid off ASAP or I'll have to seek legal action.  Also I have yet to receive my vehicle license plates or the paperwork for my truck...please send them ASAP.  ",2.6

Craig was friendly and Shawn ( I think that was his name) was also very knowledgeable and friendly. We didn't spend hours and hours in the dealership like we have in the past. Only downside is I believe we should have been given a 12 month pass to the Wash Tub - other dealers are offering similar perks and if IPAC Nissan wants to compete for further business, it would be in their best interest to get on board with the 12 month instead of the 3 month, starting with me.

  I had to initial a IPAC document showing a lesser amount, and during all of this had my wife with me.  We both had heard and seen the monthly amount and were very pleased.  Our budget is set and now we have to arrange things again.  My fault for wanting this vehicle; but it is IPAC fault for misreprentation.

Things started slow, but it was late and we had 2 cranky kids in tow. Once Jimmy found the car we had come to look at (we researched and shopped online) everything fell into place. The entire process could not have gone any smoother! ",5.0
480,"April 09, 2011","Using the internet made it easy to get the preliminary items completed prior to an actual visit. Barbie Martinez was very professional and made me feel at ease and set the appointment for John Gatewood. John made us feel comfortable and provided us with a test drive in the Rogue that we had picked out prior to the visit. The negotiations were simple to the point and completed in a short time frame. E.J. Johnson was very professional and also made us feel comfortable with the visit and we were completed with the financing process in short order. The Rogue was cleaned and ready for us at the front door, can't get any better than that.",5.0
481,"April 04, 2011","EVERYONE INVOLVED IN MY PURCHASE WAS GREAT!!  I HAD BEEN SEARCHING FOR MY JUKE FOR OVER 2 MONTHS AND WHEN I FINALLY FOUND THE ONE I WAS LOOKING FOR ONLINE THE EXPERIENCE WAS EASY.  FROM THE FIRST PERSON I TALKED TO IN THE INTERNET SALES DEPARTMENT, TO THE SALESMAN THAT SOLD ME THE CAR, TO THE FINANCIAL DEPARTMENT AND EVERYONE ELSE IN BETWEEN THE EXPERIENCE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN BETTER!  I TRADED IN MY OLD VEHICLE AND WAS PLEASED WITH THE AMOUNT OF MONEY I GOT FOR MY TRADE AND SINCE I HAD NO IDEA I WOULD BE MAKING THE PURCHASE RIGHT THEN THE SALESMAN FOLLOWED ME TO MY HOUSE TO GET THE TITLE FOR MY OLD TRUCK SO THAT I COULD DRIVE MY NEW JUKE AND HAVE IT RIGHT THEN!!  ALL OF MY QUESTIONS WERE ANSWERED IN FULL AND EVERYONE TOOK WHATEVER TIME IT TOOK TO GET THE TRANSACTION COMPLETED IN A TIMELY AND PLEASURABLE MANNER. I HOPE I CONTINUE TO HAVE THE GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH THE DEALERSHIP AS I CONTINUE THE MAINTENANCE ON MY NEW JUKE.",5.0
482,"April 01, 2011","Customer Service was excellent Mr.John Gatewood is a great salesman.  He had a great attitude towards us and making his sales.  I would really recommend this dealership to all my fireinds.  
Good clean environment which talks really good about a place.",5.0
483,"April 01, 2011",Everyone was nice. My complaint is that I had to return to the dealership two times after my initial visit because things were overlooked by the staff. The process was a little disorganized. My gas tank was filled the last visit I had to make which was nice.,3.2
484,"March 22, 2011",Everyone I dealt with there was very professional. They wanted to hear about my concerns and to make sure I was satisfied during and after my purchase. They were honest about the price and gave me a good price. I would recommend this dealership to my friends and relatives.,5.0
485,"March 17, 2011","i had the BEST experience.  no one made me feel bad about my situation, talked down to me, or approached me like a shark.  everyone was extremely nice and patient with me.  i especially want to thank craig doyle.  it was because of his service that i decided to buy!  even with his other customers, he made me feel like i was his only customer.  i truly haven't said enough to describe the helpfulness craig showed me, but i hope this email paints the picture.  thank you thank you thank you!",5.0
486,"March 16, 2011","I am very happy that I chose Ingram park for my first car purchase.
Albert, was simply awesome .He realized the fact that I was a first time car buyer and offered me great help.

He patiently took time to show me the car,helped me to test drive it. We then started to sit and start discussing about the price.

He clearly listened to my expectations, and we finally arrived at a price.
He was very patient.
He made Ingram Park Nissan a one stop place for all my Shopping, finance, Maintenance and Insurance needs.
He clearly noted the points which I wanted him to take a note of.

Thought it was late in the night he made sure that everything was in place.
He gave me the documents what he had to give us and even offered us great help even on the second day.

We had great trust on ALBERT and  INGRAM PARK Nissan and I guess we got we were looking for.Thanks ALBERT and thanks IPark.

487,"March 15, 2011","John was very friendly and helpful from the start. He showed me a vehicle that fit what I was looking for. As a matter of fact, that vehicle, the one I bought had more features than I was expecting to be able to buy. They worked with me on a price, I might have liked to get down another $1000. but it was exceptable.",4.8
488,"March 10, 2011","Originally I dealt with Dale in the Internet Sales Department by phone. He was wonderful! Helpful, knowledgeable, professional and friendly. When I finished purchasing my Xterra, he found me and introduced himself to my Mom and I. He was very nice and welcoming. 

James handled some of the financing discussion and he was very nice and helpful. I was hoping to purchase the vehicle for less, but James was able to meet the monthly payment maximum for me, at least, which I appreciated. 

Georgette handled the final paperwork at the end of the sale and she was extremely professional, knowledgeable, patient and friendly. I changed my mind about some of the paperwork suggestions, so she had to re-do it a couple of times. She was helpful and understanding. 

Since the purchase of my new Xterra, I have dealt primarily with Craig Johnson in the Customer Care Department. When he found out that my Mom speaks Spanish, he came out to meet with her and spoke with her at length. Was very engaging and nice. He has consistently made himself available for questions and issues. 

Within an hour of driving off the car lot, the ""Service Engine Soon"" light came on. Apparently, there was a faulty sensor device in the engine. I had to have the car taken back to the dealership in order for them to take care of the problem. In so doing, I have been communicating with Craig in order to get the repair completed. 

Both Craig and Georgette have bent over backwards to accommodate me and help me with questions and concerns. ",4.2
489,"March 07, 2011","We started off with an internet salesperson and let him know that we were driving fours to come and buy an armada and he assured us that our payments were not going to be over the max I could pay.  We were expecting to go in with no haggle pricing.  The first offer was way over our limit.  Not only that, there was an internet price that was given and when we went in, they told us that the price on the internet was no longer valid.  Well, had we known that, we would never have driven so far. We were there for two hours and after the papers were signed, we had to wait another hour to have the car detailed and washed.  The salesperson also told us that the third row of the armada reclines and found out that it does not.  To top it all off, when had the chance to inspect the car, they sold us a brand new car with a long scratch on it. We understand the whole ""they gotta make a sale"" attitude.  But people are investing a lot of money into their purchase and I probably would have done things differently like purchase from another dealer.",2.8
490,"February 26, 2011","Knowledgeable and friendly staff were very patient in answering all my questions regarding the features of the 2011 Pathfinder. There was no ""Sales"" pressure to buy the vehicle.

I had a vehicle to trade-in and the staff was extremely helpful in getting me the best price for that vehicle.",5.0
491,"February 19, 2011","Overall I had a great experience but I was surprised
At the length of time it took to finalize everything . But it has been awhile since I 
Purchased a vehicle so I'm not sure if this is a normal ocurrence. Adam was very professional and friendly and 
I was pleased with his extensive knowledge of the vehicle I purchased .",5.0
492,"February 19, 2011","Por que he comprado carros en otros lugares y desde que vinimos a Nissan no he querido ir a ningun otro lado a comprar, he recomendado cantidad de gente en mi trabajo para que vayan a ver los carros y el servicio que tienen en Nissan.  La calidad del trabajo que hacen, sus instalaciones nuevas y lo amigable que son les da al menos de mi parte un 100 en la experiencia de comprar un auto nuevo o usado.",5.0
493,"February 17, 2011","Fred has worked very hard to make me a satisfied customer.  I would certainly recommend Fred to my friends and colleagues who are interested in the purchase of a new Nissan.  I would further note that once IPAC was made aware of some of my concerns with the buying experience, they have tried exceptionally hard to make me a satisfied customer.  Thanks Fred and thanks IPAC management.....",4.4
494,"February 03, 2011","I purchased a 2006 Nissan Maxima the enviroment at the dealership was very layed back. Angel assured me that I was going to get a Maxima regardless of any type of credit situation, he was nice before and after I purchased the vehicle. The attitude of everyone here was genuine and compassionate. I've honestly gotta say this was a great experience they will help you out here and many car dealerships don't take the time to do any of this. The salesman angel is here to help people he doesnt want to just sale you a car he wants to help",5.0
495,"January 25, 2011","Very impressed with knowledge and friendliness of salesperson (Rudy), he didn't act like a ""pressure salesman"" but more as friend of family.  Tried his best to get exactly what we wanted and for price we could afford.  For as much as I hate trading cars, this experience was the best it could be.  All employees tried to make it as painless as possible.",4.7
496,"January 15, 2011","I recently returned to IPAC Nissan for a fourth time and plan on returning for the fifth. Each time has been a wonderful experience with a staff that is accessible, informative, friendly, and hospitable. Craig has sold me all of my cars and in my opinion is the best employee at IPAC.
I can ALWAYS call him no matter how simple or complicated the question. I recommend Craig and the rest of the staff from sales to service and financial for anyone looking for a new or used car. ",5.0
497,"January 15, 2011",I recently purchased my vehicle at Ingram Park Nissan.  I was elated that they were able to price match another area dealer in order to gain my business.  Seven years ago I purchased an SUV and now have come back to purchase my next seven year vehicle.  Thanks again!,5.0
498,"December 21, 2010",I have always found the Nissan cars to be very dependable and with proper maintanience you can drive them for years and years with few problems. This is my second time to buy from the Ingram Park Nissam dealership. They are very friendly and very helpful. They even fed me and my friend lunch when it was taking me some time to decide on which car I wanted. Buying a new car is stressful but work hard to help it be less so. I highly recommend them to everyone looking to buy a new or a used car.,4.6
499,"November 22, 2010","Sir
I just wanted to express my sincere appreciation in the superb customer service provided to me by Mr. Jimmy Foster.  He convinced me to come down and actually test drive the 2010 370Z Roadster and knew it was the vehicle for me.  Although it was a bit more than I expected to finance Jimmy's great sense of salemanship with a personal touch of friendship was enough to get me stay in my seat when I was ready to bolt for the door.  Definitely want to express my sincere appeciation for the finance rep I can't remember his name but he made the final transaction for my vehicle very enlightening a first for me.  This is the third Z I have bought from your dealership and this transaction has been the most enjoyable.  Once again please pass on my special thaks to Mr. Foster he is indeed represents the Nissan image of super customer service.Begore I forget please pass my thanks to Barbie also she is great!

Sincerely

500,"November 14, 2010","Very frustrating, poor communication and ignorance of process within the dealership, had to provide the same information numerous times which delayed car purchase by a week. When the vehicle was finally delivered it was dirty with a empty fuel tank which was a final slap in the face. ",1.8
501,"September 11, 2010","Went to dealership today to get a quote for a Nissan Altima.  Sales manager would not provide us with a quote for the vehicle unless we would buy it that same day.  We were told they could beat any other dealers price but that a quote would not be provided unless we were ready to buy. If the dealership is really providing an unbeatable new car price, they should not have to resort to these type of tactics that pressure customers to buy today or we can't discuss a deal with you. This type of tactics result in impulse buys that rarely benefit the consumers. Come on IPAC Nissan, if you're truly the best deal out there then why not be upfront on what your best price is on a new vehicle? I have purchased cars form IPAC Mazda with great satisfaction and expected same experience with IPAC Nissan but was greatly disappointed. ",1.8
502,"September 11, 2010","We were determined to purchase a new Murano over Labor Day weekend.  We went to Ancira Nissan and World Car in San Antonio.  Both had horrible customer service, we will never return to either place.  At our wits end, we went to Ingram Park Nissan who really got down to business. We asked for the same price as listed in Sunday's paper by Ancira.  We got what we wanted w/o little hassle.  

I'd recommend anyone shopping in San Antonio needs to stop by IPAC on 410, it's worth the trip.

503,"August 25, 2010","enjoyed the visit,thought Jason gave us a reasonable quote.  Will return to purchase future automobiles with your company.  Will also recommend customers, since I have an automobile insurance agency located @618 bandera rd 210-733-3333.  I have selling auto insurance since 1983, & we love our customers. ",5.0
504,"March 22, 2010","Bought a new vehicle on Feb 23, 2010, as of March 21, 2010 I still do not have a backup Intellikey.  I was provided with ONE key fob during purchase and have been given nothing but excuses on getting the second key fob programmed.  Their ""special"" laptop used for programming the keys is down, blah blah blah.  Really?  A new car dealership without the ability to program keys for the Nissans they sell?  A total joke of a dealership.  Sales process when buying the vehicle took over 4 hours with the back and forth game used in Slick Car Sales 101.  Do NOT do business with Ingram Park Nissan if being valued as a customer is important to you.",1.4
