1,"August 22, 2018","I drove 4.5 hours from Oklahoma to look at a used 2014 Silverado they had for sale. After getting there they pull out the bare keys. I asked where the key fobs were. They tell me they don’t have them. I ask how do you use the remote start with no fobs. They tell me it doesn’t have remote start. The ad on Autotrader listed remote start. She goes and talks to someone and they agree to add remote start. I tell them if the truck has navigation, it came with remote start, they just need the fobs. They go to the truck and bring in the original sticker from when it was new. Plainly written on the sticker “Remote start”! I shoulda turned around and left! They disappear again and comeback with one fob. I asked where they found it, they say it was in someone’s desk drawer. They proceed to start the truck and it sounds like it has no exhaust at all. I test drive it, we get back and they asked what I thought. I told them it was too loud. They agree to reimburse me to fix the exhaust( which they did 3 weeks later). After I get the exhaust fixed I notice a vibration which I thought was the exhaust being dumped in front of the axle. I take it in to get the tires balanced. I notice it still has a vibration. I take it back to the people who balanced the first time. They do a road force balance and discover two of the tires are bad. I’ve since called my salesman and they told me to talk to Don Bailey, which I have left 3 voicemails for and has yet to call me back! I’ve called numerous other times to only be transferred to someone else’s voicemail, with no return calls!! I did finally talk to someone named Steve whose response was to me “Did you make it home”! Not a place that sounds like they take care of their customers.  All this after their 125 point inspection! 

My advice is to NEVER step foot inside any Autonation dealership!!!

I’m now in the process of taking the truck to a GM dealership to have the rough idle looked at. I’m hoping the Powertrain warranty will cover that. 

 This has been $1,000 out of my pocket and I haven’t even owned the truck a month. Their 125 point inspection is a joke!",1.5
2,"May 17, 2018",Christine helped me find the perfect Ford Escape. She understood that I had my own ideas about what I wanted and she didn't try to push me into something more than I needed.. it was a great experience and I'm very happy with my purchase!,5.0
3,"April 14, 2018","Doug Welch demonstrated real professionalism when we changed our minds after purchasing a used vehicle.  He listened and followed through patiently, helping us retrieve our payment --which turned out to be complicated and frustrating -- but he stayed with it.

8,"December 25, 2016",I worked with Mary Yvonne Monroe and Sam Ramadan on purchasing a 2016 F150.  I told them the basic package that I was looking for and they had one in their inventory.  Mary was patient with me and answered all the questions I had about all the different knobs and buttons and she linked up the blue tooth to my phone.  Sam explained the financing and made sure I understood everything.  I would definitely purchase another truck from them in the future.,5.0
9,"December 16, 2016","I went in for a test drive on a 2012 ford escape,  I've already been looking around at vehicles for a few months so I knew what I wanted, could afford.  They ultimately matched what I wanted to pay monthly which was great,  I still wanted tone to think about it.  They gave me 48 hours to do so.  They're sales people,  they're almost meant to be pushy but they were good. I would reccomend this group to friends and strangers. ",4.8
10,"July 12, 2016","I purchased a 2011 Ford Edge about 8 months ago.  The experience was ok, it wasn't great but they were, for the most part, attentive.  I didn't haggle on price because my wife (who was pregnant at the time) liked the car and wasn't in a condition to endure the ""wear down"" period where a dealer artificially extends the negotiation time to a point where you're more 'amiable' to saying ""yes"" to options or other incurred costs.  That's not to say that we didn't have to sit in a waiting room for a considerable amount of time, but Mr. Bell would periodically check in on us and give us updates.

12,"April 20, 2012","This was the best car buying experience I have ever had. Eric Victor was a great sales person to deal with and worked very had to find me the exact Mustang convertible I was looking for. The finance guy Sam Ramadan was very easy to work with, I felt no pressure. The manager Don Bailey was also involved to make sure I left the dealership a happy customer. Everyone was very professional and a pleasure to work with. I LOVE my new car. I know I got an awesome deal and I would recommend them. I have never had such an easy car buying experience before.",5.0
13,"November 17, 2011","Allison was very patient and I didn't feel pressured at any time.  After some negotiating, she gave me the best price out of 6-8 Ford dealers.  She committed to the price in writing and there were no surprises.  Dealing with her was a very pleasant experience!  It was a welcomed change compared to some of the other Ford dealerships I dealt with.  Even after multiple emails and phone calls over several weeks, she was as polite as the first time I spoke with her.  She took the time to see if there were other rebates I qualified for that others had missed (there were).  I had my car choices narrowed down to two - a Mustang and another car.  The only reason I didn't buy from her is that I picked the other car (a brand Bankston doesn't sell). I have nothing but good things to say about Allison.  When I decide to replace my Ford truck, she's the one I'm calling first.  I felt like she wanted me to be happy, even though I didn't buy from her.  ",5.0
