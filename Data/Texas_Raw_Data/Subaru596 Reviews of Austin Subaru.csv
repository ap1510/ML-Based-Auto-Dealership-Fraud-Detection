My service technician was superb. And I alway get a coupon for a free car wash to use at a time of my choosing. Kudos. ,5.0
1,"June 26, 2020","I really appreciate that y'all ordered me a Lyft home when my oil change was going to take 2 hours.  I wish the ""express"" line was quicker!! Seems that a 2 hour wait for an oil change is NOT very ""express"". It's a disincentive to do my services at the dealership and not, I  think, how Subaru wants to be perceived.",4.0

4,"June 20, 2020","It’s always a pleasure to take my car to the Subaru dealership, especially after having other cars and taking them to other dealerships.  I had a rental waiting for me and when my service was done, the dealership delivered my vehicle to my door and took the rental.  Everything was very clean and all staff I interacted with wore masks.  My car was sanitized once delivered to my door.  I highly recommend.",5.0
5,"June 13, 2020","I have nothing but rave reviews for Susan Moulton, my service adviser for this visit, and really hope she'll work with me in the future when I bring in my car for servicing!
Kudos to Austin Subaru as well for offering Free Pick-Up and Delivery during the current pandemic!  I've been sheltering in place at home since mid-March, and there was no way I could have driven my car to and from the dealership for extremely necessary servicing!  I had serious problems with the air conditioning in the car, and they also discovered a bubble in one of my tires, which they fixed right away.  I thought Marco the driver was very patient and professional, and I appreciated his wearing a mask and sanitizing the car before getting into the car and after returning it to me..",5.0

He was so kind as to meet me half way to San Antonio with my new Outback. While I waited for it you be arriving in Austin, he actually sent a video message to introduce himself. Thanks Kurtis, ",5.0

17,"May 24, 2020","It’s hard to write this review, because I have nothing against Subaru itself, but my three-day experience with Austin Subaru has been nothing but a complete disaster. Since my salesperson (Nate Lowther) refuses to acknowledge me or my situation any longer, I felt a review was the only way to let him, his boss, and the owners know the gravity of the situation that he and his financial team have now left me in.

To preface, my 2006 Toyota Corolla finally bit the dust, and I realized it was time to put her down. Spending thousands a year in repair is just not in the cards for me and I wanted to get something more reliable, obviously. To get around, I got a rental for the month because it’s cheaper than ride shares and doesn’t require severe exposure to the public/covid via public transit. A compact car rental can run ~$700/month, which is what I paid – on top of my regular car insurance of $120/month.

Nate knew my car situation. He was also fully aware of my financial situation (i.e. an “okay” credit score, on unemployment due to Covid, freelance side job, etc.). Throughout the whole process, I was made to feel that this was in the bag. The design team (Hilary R.) even came out, discussed add-ons, and congratulated me on my new car purchase when we wrapped up with her. Seriously, I was congratulated as though this was a done deal.

Nate came in immediately after (we saw him waiting for Hilary to wrap up), and he started asking if my boyfriend would co-sign, that he needed paystubs more recent than what I had provided, and that my freelance documentation wasn’t adequate. I didn’t want help from anyone at the time, and I couldn’t understand how things just took such a hard left.

My partner needed to go to work, so we left at 230p with Nate telling us he would update us as he worked to get this done. My partner even wanted to make sure this guy was taken care of if someone else helped us because Nate had come in on his day off to meet with us. That was probably the nicest part of the whole situation.

That evening, I get a text asking about my unemployment and I sent my documentation thinking this was okay. The text I receive back is, “Hey there! So your info has been submitted to the bank of choice. Of course with is being late in the day, we won’t hear back until tomorrow. So far it’s still there and waiting on you haha but I will let you know as soon as I know something.“

What ended up happening is something I can’t even make up. The next morning, when I hadn’t heard from Nate by 1130a, I texted him that I would be trying to apply through my own credit union – I even expressed that it seemed like I wasn’t going to get approved through their banks. So I asked for the requested loan amount. Nate’s reply, “Great. Let me check with the add ones (*ons) from the design girls.” He then texted, “We actually bank with [same bank], do you want us to submit to them?”

Not understanding that their paperwork was filled out in a way that would cause me to have an automatic denial, I said, “That would be great!” That was 1150a on Friday, May 22.  When I didn’t hear back from him, I started to think that I should ask for help and get a co-signer. Swallowing my pride, I asked. After much debate and weighing options, I texted Nate, “Also, if ****  can co-sign, can she do this without being present? She lives in *******” – to which Nate sent the online form and said he would ask, also said she needed to send her ID, etc. I say, “Will do! I’m about to chat with her.” – at 223p Friday. 312p Nate replies stating people are interested in the car we’re trying to buy. I respond by saying I need to discuss things with my co-signer…324p Nate texts to say again that he’s trying to hold the car from other folks trying to buy it. I explain what’s going on and ask a few more questions, and by 5p my co-signer had filled out the forms.

After a lot of back and forth Nate replies, “It looks like we found a place!” and proceeds to let us know we need to submit more proof of income. Which was done. This guy then sends a text, “So.. what we believe will be the easiest with ****not being able to show paystubs (btw, my co-signer received retirement, is an independent travel agent and works a very very part time job at an art’s center), is for her to go to her bank and apply for the loan herself and that way her personal bank has all of her info and will be able to get anything else they may need. The car is still here, so if she goes in the morning and talks to her bank about the vehicle and a loan, we believe we will be able to get it. It’s hard for banks to accept loans right now without proof of income coming in. Her bank has her deposited checks and her personal information and should be able to assist better. I still have hope!”

To which, I replied, “Are you not able to just take her retirement? I can’t ask her to go to her bank to apply. Did you say a bank statement showing a pay deposit would work?”

To which Nate replies that he asked his manager to submit the forms with just her retirement and he would do so. He also stated that with it being so late in the day (645p) we wouldn’t hear back until the morning.

To be honest, I think Nate recommended I get my co-signer to just get a loan through their bank because this is where they knew they screwed up. I can only speculate, because not one person from this place has explained anything to me honestly.

Moving on…

Next morning, at 916a I send a text asking if everything worked out and inquired if my debit card would be an acceptable form of payment for my down payment. Nate texts back at 934a, “Good morning! I sure will. And yes, you can use your debit card. I’ll let you know something soon.”

Hours pass…at 1128a I ask Nate to let me know if there are any issues, and if we needed to try another dealership we needed to do so sooner rather than later. No response…

I let my co-signer know that I hadn’t heard anything – we both become concerned at this point. While chatting, my co-signer receives a weird voicemail from a Johnny Johanny who seems to be reaching out to her as if she’s a new lead that needs to be worked. I have this voicemail and Johnny’s message is weird, to say the least. I send Nate the voicemail along with my trepidations, “My [co-signer] just received this VM – it’s very concerning to us that just anyone is accessing her info. I will be coming in around 140p.”

Again, absolutely no response…

I arrive around 2p and ask for Nate. He comes to the foyer, after I hear him and someone in the finance department mention my name, my co-signers name and something about Wells Fargo. Nate then gives me a run-around. Seriously, he started the convo by saying they still needed income verification – BUT everything was submitted. What he told me in person made absolutely no sense at all. I let him basically BS me and he ends the conversation by assuring me my loan was still being worked on.

I leave extremely confused, but I tell him that I’ll let him know if I find another car elsewhere because he couldn’t say if the bank would get back to them same day or not and we really needed to get this done. I told him this was becoming a bit tedious for me, and acknowledged it was for him as well, but he stood there and apparently lied while I tried to understand what the heck was actually going on.

Since I really wanted a Subaru, I called Georgetown Sub and decide to head that way since the two dealerships are not related. They had inventory, and at this point I’m ready to NOT give Austin Sub the business because I’m feeling really uncomfortable with the whole process.

What did I find out? After re-starting the loan process and waiting three hours, I am told that Austin Subaru basically screwed me over. How? Let me tell you…

Apparently, Austin Subaru ran my loan application through at least 11 different banks (all the major ones) with information that any auto-finance person with experience would know would result in an automatic denial. Georgetown tells me that their finance guy spoke with Wells Fargo’s loan officer and found out that Austin Sub submitted the app and should have known I was denied for at least a day. So this means when I went to Austin Sub after Nate refused to respond to my valid concerns, he knew that there was no way I would be approved.

Not only did I find out the way they filled out the forms would result in a denial BY LAW from any lender, but I was told I would not be able to get ANY financing through any other dealership for 60-90 days unless it was in-house financing outside of Subaru. Even then, there’s no guarantee when you only have one shot. I was also told that I would have been approved had Austin Sub filled out my forms with my paystubs up to Covid. Maybe not for what I applied for, but at least for something certified. Reliable and with a warranty were two of my main concerns in a new vehicle.

While my new sales rep at Georgetown was breaking the news, and sincerely apologetic, I most certainly sent a text to Nate telling him “you F***ed me.” I asked him to shred all of mine and my co-signer’s info. I told him that Georgetown was honest and upfront about everything, including what Austin Sub had done. I also brought it to Nate’s attention that I now had to wait 60-90 days to reapply for anything.

“We sure will,” was the only reply I received from this person. He didn’t take ownership, he never gave me straight answers, and he was too cowardly to let me know what was actually going on. Every step of the way, this guy left me in the dark.

I told him I would share my story and that they should be ashamed, as they should, for not having the courage to be honest. He knew all day I had ultimately been denied because they didn’t know what they were doing. Georgetown was on track to get me approved because they seem to have experienced staff who actually know what they were doing.

My last text to Nate asked for the owner’s contact info/email address, to which I did not receive a reply. I doubt I receive one.

To the owner of Austin Subaru, please make sure your salespeople are trained on how to deal with special circumstances. Please make sure no one is ever led on the way I was led on – never receiving ANY word on approval or denial is pretty messed up when you hand over such personal and sensitive information. Make sure your financial department knows how to fill out forms properly.

Above all, Nate needs some training on how to deal with giving people bad news. To just take someone’s info and then start ignoring them is so wrong on so many levels. This actually hurt me, as I was left in disbelief that this was something that could actually happen. Georgetown had to break the news to me and said that they couldn’t do anything with my application for financing because Austin Sub had already hit every bank possible.

For someone trying to make a better life for herself, it doesn’t help that these guys screwed me over from anything but Toyota or another dealer’s in-house ONLY financing. Seriously, Austin Sub made it to where I can’t even go get third party financing from another brand for 60-90 days, and they won’t even take ownership for what they did - NO apologies, NO acknowledgement. Just a “We sure will,” when I asked if they would shred my info. 

By the way, Nate had another person’s ID in my file folder, seemingly felt embarrassed about it when we saw it, then waded it up and threw it in the trash in front of me and my partner. Do they shred all the things that simply go into their waste baskets? Who knows, but I don’t think I would like my photo-copied ID just ending up in the waste basket and then the dumpster for anyone to obtain. Paranoid? Maybe, but I should have known then that I was dealing with someone who is either new or just doesn’t know how to handle situations properly. 

I digress…

I would have had no problem being told I was denied – I went into this whole thing thinking I would be - but to know I would have been approved had Austin Sub not been incompetent, to know that they were too cowardly to be up-front about the situation, AND to find out they did something SO detrimental that it cannot be corrected, I have a BIG problem. Not that they care, and not that anything can be done to fix this, but if I can’t get in-house financing from Toyota, Honda, or some other reliable car-maker, I will either have to get another crappy vehicle or pay $700 a month for a rental for the next three months.

Nate Lowther didn’t care. His manager didn’t care. The financial person who ran my app didn’t care. They strung me along and then thought ghosting me was an acceptable way to handle such a horrible situation that could have been avoided.

As I write this, no one from Sub Austin has even told me I was approved or denied. The salesperson at the unrelated Sub in Georgetown was the one who had to break this news to me, and he felt horrible in having to do so. Again, these two dealerships are not even owned by the same people but I had to go to Georgetown to find out what actually happened.

Nate, I still believe that you and whoever you worked with on this should be ashamed of yourselves for not being forthcoming. I might have used the F-word to describe what you and your finance person did to me, but I believe using it once to emphatically let you know exactly what you did was justified and within reason. Seriously, you f***ed me.

--Or is there another bank out there to which you haven’t tried to submit my information – with info that experienced folks in your industry KNOW will return an automatic denial? Georgetown told me that my last actual pay stubs were still usable and they were actually using them to get me through. I got tiered and then ran into a wall because of the paperwork you all submitted to every bank possible.

Learn to communicate about the process and what is going on during each step. Learn that ghosting people just because you don’t want to be honest about what happened is not a trait suited for someone in your position. Most of all, I hope you learn that you can really put someone in a worse place than when they walked through your doors if you don’t know what you’re doing.

I came in knowing exactly what I wanted and I didn’t need anyone to sell me on anything. I was looking for someone who could be straight-up and honest. That you were not, and now I am left utterly devastated by your ineptitude.",1.0

21,"May 14, 2020","Susan is a gem, she goes above and beyond! She has been so helpful in the past, and this time we had  sudden a/c failure (both compressor and condenser) at under 30,000 miles, but we were about 8 months over the 3 year warranty. This is our first Subaru, and after years of having to beg and plead with other companies to fix things properly that failed while STILL IN WARRANTY, I didn't have much hope that the outcome would be any different this time, especially being out of warranty. Fully expecting to be told ""sorry, you are over warranty timeframe"" I was so pleasantly surprised to hear Susan say that this kind of thing shouldn't happen on such a low-mileage car, and that Subaru would make it right. No debating or having to argue may case - Susan & Subaru took care of it ASAP and have made my family a Subaru family for the long haul! It's one thing to have a mechanical failure, it happens, people and machines aren't perfect, but it's how it is dealt with that really shows true colors. Susan & Subaru know what it takes to keep customers happy and build loyalty. Thanks Susan!",5.0

44,"March 12, 2020","My car  (2017 Outback)  needed an oil change. I typically take my car to a Jiffy Lube, but as I bought the car used from Austin Subaru, decided  to try their express service for this service. 
Arrived about 8:30 am and was quickly handled by the service advisor. He also noticed that I had a tire low warning light on and after a quick diagnostic felt it was just a low tire pressure. I told him I'd already pumped one tire up to 30lbs to match the others and it didn't go off. He said that these tires should be pressurized to 35lbs each. Which was news to me. He said they'll  check on that when they did a inspection (fluid levels, pressure, etc.) of  the car before returning it to me. Left the car off and was told it should be ready in 90 minutes. 
The car was ready within about an hour (surprise 1). A nice case of under promising and over performing. The car didn't have a warning light for the tires anymore, so pressurizing the tires to 35lbs. did the trick. (surprise 2)  Moreover, they inspection revealed a week battery. As I've only had the car about 6 months, a new batter was installed under warranty (surprise 3).
So for the price of an oil change, avoided a possible repair problem and a battery replacement. 

Will I take it there again? I sure would!",4.8

I saved up for the service, returned in October 2018, and final amount was $1,021.00. I drank the Subaru kool-aid culture-wise but am writing a review so others are aware that this recommended service is extremely overpriced and consists of potentially unnecessary checks/fixes. 

I wasn't consulted about what was necessary prior to the service - seems the service managers went through a checklist and didn't consider that some of the work wasn't necessary. That total included a tire rotation despite the fact that two weeks prior I had a brand new set of tires put on my car. It also included an inexplicable $80 shop fee and another random $35 repair request fee (I didn't request any repairs). 

Background on my vehicle is that it is in perfect condition - I was simply following recommendations from Subaru by going in because I had reached the 60,000 mile service. I did sign the paperwork so feel a review is the only thing left to do at this point - learned a lesson and will think twice before ever going back to the dealership for any kind of service.

My only negative review I have is the $300 transportation fee for my 2019 Crosstrek. It doesn’t make sense in my mind for me to pay $300 for someone else to drive my NEW car 160+miles. Seems a bit excessive to charge that much in my opinion. 

Overall I am pleased though. They did great helping me. I am happy to know y’all offer military discount. I have been serving for over six years and it’s great to have a community support that. 

Again, thank you and your entire team for great hospitality and service! ",4.0

Fouad fully explained all of the options we had in choosing the cars, but never pressured us at any step of the purchase.  Indeed, the experience was so impressive that a couple of days later a friend of ours asked us to accompany her to purchase a car.  We brought her to Fouad and he showed her all the options she had for a preowned car in her price range.

286,"June 26, 2018","I should be over the moon with Austin Subaru and my recent service experience: Craig in Service was kind and resourceful, I wasn't charged a penny for the work or they did to replace a gear shift plate that was malfunctioning on my 6yo Impreza, they provided a lovely loaner car so I wouldn't be without transportation while the work was being done, and the 45 minutes or so that I did wait for things to shake out and the loaner to be ready were entirely pleasant with the addition of a cappuccino and bagel provided (also free) by the awesome waitstaff at the cafe.

So why am I feeling reservations about recommending Austin Subaru wholeheartedly? Well, mainly because the service took a week to perform. When Craig and I spoke initially, he told me I really didn't have an option other than to leave the car with them, and they'd be happy to call me an Uber to get home, as there were no loaners available until the following week. I live in SW Austin, so it's a 20 minute drive, I don't have a second car, and Craig said they wouldn't even be able to get to looking at the car to diagnose the problem for 3 or 4 days. I asked if I could make an appointment to bring the car in when they could look at it immediately, and Craig said no, that would just put me at the end of the line again on that day. He said he could try to get someone to look at it today, and directed me to the lounge to wait for what I expected to be all day (I got there in the morning).

I have been in this very situation what seems to be every time I visit Austin Subaru--waiting forever in a very nice waiting area, with plenty of junk food to tempt me (not good), surrounded by well-meaning, very busy service and sales people. I had had the forethought to bring my knitting, so I pulled that out.

15 minutes later Craig returned to the waiting area to tell me that he had found me a loaner, and 30 minutes after that I was on my way home.

After not hearing from the service team, I had to call a few days later to check the status of my car. I got Craig on the line, and he apologized for not having kept me up to date. Apparently the part needed was on order, but it would be a few more days before it would arrive. I was a little confused, because I though they would want to ask first before actually ordering a part on my behalf, but I figured whatever the cost, I needed the car in working order, so. A few days later, Craig called to let me know the car was ready. I went in and traded out the loaner for my car, and was surprised that both the service and parts were provided for free. I'm still not quite sure why that was.

So I should be happy, right?",4.8

Also, I remember my first service visit, they went over everything that was executed/checked, and did things like show me (on paper) what my tire tread level was, etc. However, since that first visit, that really hasn't happened again. I can figure the tire thing out on my own, but it was nice to have it pointed out to me.

Lastly, and this was very odd, but there was a TV in the waiting area showing comparative pricing on various maintenance items, comparing Austin Subaru against some franchises. The odd part is, for one of the categories (can't remember which), Austin Subaru was at least 50% more expensive (with no other value-adds)...

My headlight already needs replaced and my car is currently going through consumption testing for engine oil problems. I also believe during the sales process he lied about the total price of the car. I put 2000 down, and it didn't change the 15500 price at all. After I gave him the 2000 he said it went to Title, registration, etc. Why wasn that included in the total price? Why was I told it in the beginning? he knew I was in a tight spot and took advantage knowing I needed a car asap.

Everyone else was kind and courteous making sure i was being taken care of. one HUGE negative for me, which knocked it down from 5 to 4 stars, they do not wash cars in an effort to ""save water"", yet they give a voucher to take it somewhere that apparently doesn't save water, a car wash.

I do volunteer work in state and local parks as well as various land preserves - erosion and flood control, habitat restoration, invasive species work, and of course regular trail and bridge work.. The work is often in hard-to-reach locations where AWD is a must. Sometimes the convoy must look hilarious - multiple large 4x4 pickups with the double rear wheels and in among them my little Forrester. The Forrester is small enough and nimble enough that it can get to places the pickups can't. On one recent project the first words the land steward said when I arrived were ""oh good you brought the Subaru."" It can drive in and out where the big boys have to back out or just call it quits. It's EXACTLY what I need.

When I walk through the doors of Austin Subaru, I know that I am going to be treated with respect from the sales floor to the service department.   

As a woman, buying a car can be an infuriating experience. At other dealerships I had salesmen question my ability to drive a manual transmission, drop women-driver jokes, try to TELL me what I wanted, talk over me to my husband, and give me the run around with numbers. 

Working with John Martinez on my latest purchase was hands-down the best experience in purchasing a new vehicle I have had. Each time I test drove a car, he tossed me the keys and said ""go for a spin and let me know what you think!"" He was extremely informative and he talked with me, not at me. He gave me space to make my decision and not once did I ever feel like I was being SOLD something but rather being assisted with my purchase. For that I will gladly hand over my money. 

Other dealerships could learn a lot from the folks at Austin Subaru.

We weren't big spenders but I feel like we were treated just as if we were buying the best new car on the lot.  A particular shout out goes to Brittany Nelson, our sales consultant, who was very personable and professional. She made an impression on me and my kids and made buying my teenage son's first car a joy. We were there on easily the busiest day of their year, one of at least three customers Brittany was working with at that particular time yet she made us feel welcomed and appreciated.  I will definitely consider buying from Subaru Austin again on this experience alone. 
Another kudos goes to the Barista Josiah Bobbitt who was crazy busy making coffee drinks (good I might add) for all the waiting customers on the busiest day of the year. He did so with a smile. My kids were blown away that Subaru Austin just does that for their customers.  You don't see that kind of customer appreciation many places these days.  Beats the xxxx out of the help-yourself bad pump coffee and packaged creamer you get at other, bigger, dealerships; dealers who sell trucks three to four times the price of a Subaru. It's the little things.

The new facility is well OK, it's even on the bus  line, and there are lots of good places to eat and shop within walking distance.  The lady who was my service rep was quite helpful as well.

528,"October 14, 2016","I couldn't tell you how terrible my experience has been at Austin Subaru .This review is about   the sales process ( I didn't buy my Subaru there 
-AND-  
the service department which I also did not use nor ever will) .  

Let me preface this review with some fact about myself: 

1. I am a comedian (part-time) so I typically put humor in everything
2. I am ""new"" money.  A software Engineer/semi-retired but this was the first time buying a new car ever!
3. I use to be a broker so I know how to negotiate
4. I have 2 great danes . They are my babies. Technically I am single dad with 2 girls. 

Ok here we go 
The initial visit was ...ok .  The salesman was very nice and answered all my questions . I went in knowing I should get the Crosstrek but after driving the WRX I knew I was getting that.  Ok so I ask a ton of questions to figure out how they price car.  After about 20 minutes ( and diligent note taking) I had a general idea on how cheap I could get a new WRX for ~28k . So I went in hard saying I was going to buy car cash ( I have the $) but then decided I would lease it to improve my personal credit (which is subpar to say the least).  

So I fill out the credit app using general numbers (per salesman advice) . While that was being processed I was told to pick WRX colors I wanted and well the car wasn't at the dealership. They were going to bring if from ""another location"".  Well turns out they were geting it from another deal and wouldn't tell me . Guess they fear I would go straight there even when I gave them a deposit. 

--Ok so here is where is started going south.  Don't hide info from your clients.--

Then the finance manager , Steve, well wouldn't return my emails about being proactive on providing bank statements, pay stubs , tax returns ( I make 200k+), and business documents b/c I know my credit was not going to get my lease approved outright. Well after no replies I call Steve and he tells me tersely my application was denied and I lied on it. Remind you I put general numbers on the application per the advice of the salesperson. I ask him what we can do to reApply with the documents I was trying to provide . He wouldn't have it and hung up on me.  After speaking to salesperson I was told they would make it happen.  2 days silence and they try to push a 20% APR finance contract on me without explaining it. Super sketch. I walked away from the deal and it took over a week to get my deposit back.  

TLDR:  Steve the finance manger is not a nice person and the sale process felt slimy 

Ok so I bought my car from Georgtown Subaru. They called the bank , Chase, and boom I was approved immediately after submitting my income documents.  

Ok well luck will have it I needed to have my clutch replaced on this 2016 WRX after getting it back from body shop from an accident ( Red cars tend to get hit) .  Well the service consultant at Austin Subaru, Craig, said clutches are not covered by warranty nor will it ever be.  He sent me a bill for 2300 without even opening the transmission open. After inquiring why it couldn't be a manufacturer defect I was immediately shut down and told "" I was racing and it was my fault!"" . Again this car had 3000 miles on it. I drive like a grandma and have driven manual transmission all my life.  I know how to NOT burn a clutch

Again I took  this car to Georgetown Subaru.  They fixed it under warranty no questions asked . Had it back in 2 days too. They are THE BEST 

Austin Subaru has a tag line  "" Best Subaru Dealer in Austin"" . Well that is b/c you are the ONLY dealer in Austin TX city limits. By that logic your are also technically the: youngest, oldest, smelliest, rudest, tallest, racist, smartest, dumbest, etc ( I can keep going here) .  

Do not buy your Subaru here! Especially go to GeorgeTown Subaru if you look young, prefer to negotiate price, and want to be treated with respect.  

Oh wait... I will say this.... the bottled water at Austin Subaru is very good.  1 Star on dealership 5 Stars on the bottled water .... 0 Stars to Steve the finance manager.",1.8

My wife and I are those terrible customers that every salesperson should hate, because we ask way too many questions and never seem to make a decision. It took us roughly 3 weeks and 3 visits, plus a multitude of emailed and texted questions and several canceled appointments.

Morgan handled us very well. He was completely patient, and even empathized when I apologized for asking so many questions. He never once made us felt rushed to make a decision, and always made himself available for all of our needs. He thanked us several times for coming in a second and third time, and always made me feel like an important customer.

While I didn't interact nearly as much with the other employees, the few interactions I did have with the front desk, the finance manager, and Morgan's manager were all very positive. They were always positive, never pushy, and very easy to get along with. I never once felt like I was buying a car, but somehow at the end of it all I came home with the best car I've ever owned.

This is the third car I have bought from Roger and Austin Subaru.
Roger was very helpful in setting up my Bluetooth and cell phone and explaining basic differences in this car and the one I traded in.  I am very pleased that you have added one more experience of specialized media help and explanation with Jesse York.  I probably would not have used this equipment to full advantage since I am not a tech person.  Frankly, I had no idea what AWD or VDC systems were and how superior my Subarus have been.

It is also a welcoming dealership that has snacks, drinks, many places to sit, and best of all free loaner iPads. My sales person was Joel McColl, and he was incredibly friendly and helpful. Joel took me on a test drive and showed off the car. I explained to Joel I was on my lunch, so I wanted to hurry, but at the same time I was hoping he wouldn't rush me or pressure me. Luckily neither happened and I was able to get a feel for the car and make it back to work before my lunch ended. I then started the process of researching online, comparing prices, and better understanding the subaru vehicles. Joel was helpful through all of this. Every time I came, Joel was very popular (and lucky for him very busy) but he still made time to value me as a customer and make sure I was still doing ok. It was a good experience and I would recommend this dealership to others. 

I would give two suggestions. Their website is due for an update. The individual pages for each car are not user friendly and the overall website makes it difficult to compare between cars on their website. Also I felt rushed during the finance and paper signing (they were very busy) and I wish they would have provided the information about warranty and add-on much earlier so I could have researched and made an informed decisions. Instead I passed on everything feeling I would not make a hasty decision. 

As an added bonus, I also love my new car and would provide Subaru as a manufacture a high rating also. ",4.8

John gave me his cell number and told me to call or text him if I ever need anything- well needless to say I blew up his phone with questions, but he was extremely helpful and polite the entire time. He answered all my questions quickly and professionally, and made sure I was very well taken care of. He even made arrangements for me to have specific needs met for the car which I really appreciate. Some dealerships treat young women who come by themselves to look at cars poorly, or will try to take advantage of them, but the second I walked in the showroom I was met with a level of professional courtesy that I have found nowhere else. I honestly felt like John was on my side of the sale the entire time. I really can't express how awesome these guys are, and I wish I could go back and buy all my cars from John specifically.

I had to have it towed to Subaru and thought it was only a stuck Thermostat. Subaru diagnosed the problem and informed me that it wasn't a stuck thermostat and that they would have to take the engine apart to find out where the problem was, when they started taking the engine apart they promptly offered to provide a loaner vehicle at no charge. Subaru then found the problem was the head gasket which shouldn't have happened on a Subaru with only 80,000 miles.  The warranty on the vehicle was 5 years 60,000 miles, our car was over the mileage but within the 5 years. Subaru was VERY supportive and also surprised of this issue.  The cost to fix the head gasket was over 3,0000 dollars which was very expensive for us. I was informed that I can call the Subaru to see if they could help out with some of the cost. I got full support from the Subaru dealership here in Austin. After talking to the Subaru headquarters and then Subaru aligning with the dealer I got almost everything covered! there was a small deductible but nothing like it would have been. I want to thank this dealer ship and give a highest rating to Sean Williams and the team that helped.  During the work I was proactively called and provided updates to the work, they also helped to replace a timing belt when the engine was apart that would have cost allot of money if replaced on its own. 

Thanks again Subaru! During this ordeal I stated to my friends that I will not buy another Subaru, but after this service and support on this issue I will definitely buy another Subaru as my next car.

568,"February 27, 2014","Thank you for the 2014 Forester loaner car while the 120,000 maintenance  ---and several other items--- were completed on my 2007 Forester!

I depend on your excellent service department & certified mechanics to maintain  the reliability of my vehicle (with 132K miles)  as  I  continue to commute at least 120 miles daily.

At $2000 + it was more than I had budgeted -- I am willing to invest in service & maintainence in return for the safety & reliability  of my Subaru Forester commuter car-- especially when you take the time to explain and educate--allowing me the opportunity to make informed decisions. 

Thanks to your execellent vehicles as well as excellent service and maintainence I have no trouble recommending Austin Subaru as a great place to buy and service Subarus. 

So far,   3 of my friends  L. Watkins, J. Dixon and M. McCarthy have all purchased Subarus from Austin Subaru!

It won't be long before it is my turn to buy another Subaru Forester from Austin Subaru :-)
Roger sold me my first one in 2006!

She has been wanting to purchase a Subaru for many years as they had purchased me one as a graduation present in 1987.

I really enjoyed being able to take a car and swap it for another as soon as I returned -- it was much easier to compare models this way.

And the overnight test drive? It allowed me to test drive on Spicewood Springs (which really, every test drive should include this road) AND use it in some real-world situations (bunch of friends piled into the car, motor still had pep to it, etc).

Overall, I had a really good experience. She tried really hard to find me the exact model I wanted; when it turned out that didn't exist, she worked to find another option that'd work for me.",5.0

Ralph because I didn't have any pressure to make a quick decision.  I

problem.  Also, all my emails back and forth were promptly returned.  I

The employees I interacted with, especially Roy Reyes and Isaac Gray, were very knowledgeable about my needs, your Subaru selection and seemed genuinely interested in helping me find my new Outback, which met my needs rather than just being focused on making a quick sale.

Because of their efforts, I was able to find exactly what I needed and I am very satisfied with my purchase. I look forward to purchasing my next car from you, as well as recommend Austin Subaru to others. Please let Roy and Isaac, as well as the other employees in the deakersguo, know that their efforts did not go unnoticed. You have put together a great team that makes customers feel respected and valued.

I look forward to working with your team again in the future.",5.0

A week after we picked up the vehicle, there were a couple of minor issue's and Subaru stepped up and covered the cost of both of the jobs that needed to be done. We have never had a dealership treat us with such care and kindness. Truly a wonderful experience all around!!!


Thank you for treating us like family!!

590,"February 18, 2013","I have bought 3 new vehicles from Austin Subaru since 1999, and have been very satisfied.  The third time the sales person stressed how great the bumper-to-bumper warranty is, so I bought it.  On Dec. 21st, my check engine light came on.  I stopped at Subaru where I was told it needed a new Catalytic Converter, and made an appt. for me to bring it back early on New Year's Eve.  The Service Advisor chose the day and time.  The check engine light went on and off a few times, and was off again when I returned for my appt.  S. suddenly decided that I no longer needed a Catalytic Converter.  I drove away, stopped at a store, and when I came out, the car wouldn't drive (it just floated and revved).  I had to call Subaru Roadside Service and wait an hour for a tow truck to tow it back to Austin Subaru.  I spoke with a very nice woman on the phone, and she said I would be leaving my car with them, and they would provide me with a loaner car.  But, S. wanted to drop me off in Cedar Creek (nothing within walking distance of my home), and leave me without a car.  Finally, after much convincing, he gave me a loaner car;  and, added that if I ""get a ding in it, call my insurance company, don't call him!"".  He kept my car for 5 days.  I later found out it was done in 3 days, but no one called me.  I was told the technician didn't let it idle long enough before giving it back, that's why I broke down leaving their establishment.  He offered no apology.  Shortly after I left, the check engine light came back on.  My husband took it to S. this time.  S. said it was just the gas cap.  We bought a new gas cap.  The check engine light continued to turn on and off.  We took it to another place, and they said we needed a new Catalytic Converter!  I informed S. about the continuing issues, and made another appt. (4 visits in less than 2 months) to have the Catalytic Converter replaced.  S. said he would order the parts to make sure he was ready for the appt., and he told me what day and time to bring it.  When my husband brought it in the check engine light was on, but when S. started it up, the light was off.  S. again refused to replace the C.C., but my husband told him it needed to be done now, and that's what he got the parts for.  S. just walked away, and never spoke to my husband again.  My husband didn't know for sure what was happening for 2 1/2 hours.  Then, someone else brought out the paperwork, and said they'd replaced the Catalytic Converter.  This part is covered by State Mandated Warranty, and shouldn't even have been an issue to replace from the beginning. ",2.5

592,"February 17, 2012","I don't live in Austin, but stopped in while in town on business.  My wife and I were looking at 2012 Outback.  David was very friendly and we hadn't been able to negotiate the price we wanted at our local dealership so I thought I'd give them a shot.  I sent them and e-mail documenting what I had for a trade-in and what I was looking for. We quickly came to a verbal agreement on the price on the Outback minus the trade-in and I packed up the wife and kid and left to buy the car.  Half way to the dealership I called expressing concern that the deal might be altered upon arrival.  David said they missed some all weather mats, but that would only be an extra $50, everything else would remain unchanged.  I agreed but warned them that I would walk out if the deal was altered further (he assured me that they wouldn't pull a bate and switch upon arrival).  Upon arrival and reviewing my trade in, surprise, surprise, they claim thye had entered the trade-in as a automatic instead of a standard.  Now the deal was altered an additional $500.  In most instances I would think these are the normal games dealers play, but I went out of my way to make it clear I wouldn't play and the fact that they were willing to pull a ""bate and switch"" on me after definitively saying they wound't and allowing me to drive my family a few hours in from out of town.  Shame! Shame!  If you can buy your Subaru from somewhere else.",2.2
593,"December 22, 2011","Don't do business with Austin Subaru. The word of their sales staff means very little to management or other salesmen. Verbal contracts may as well be nothing at all to these guys. If you don't get it in writing with them, it might as well not exist. 

I made an offer on a used car and drew up papers to make it official. Since I planned to pay outright, their salesman agreed to hold it for 24 hours while the cashier's check was sent from my bank via FedEx overnight. 

The very next morning I went to pay for the vehicle and pick it up, but when I got there it had been sold it out from under me -- less than nine hours later -- and the managers acted like I had no right to be upset. Now I have to spend hundreds of dollars more just to rent a car so I can go home for Christmas. 

Thanks a lot, Austin Subaru. Next time, a little respect for verbal contracts would be appreciated. I'll just be glad I didn't end up giving money to such an unscrupulous dealership.",1.8
594,"December 02, 2011",I bought a Subaru Outback from David Reyes. He said that they were part of the Costco program. I went online and Costco sent me to dealer in San Antonio. I forwarded the e-mail to David and he assured me they were paying Costco to be in the progam. He took the authorization number and said I get 2% above invoice price. Later Costco called and assured me that Austin Subaru is not in the program and will send a legal letter to Austin Subaru instructing them not to sell cars under the pretense of being in the progam. According to another authorized dealer I was taken for about $260. Shame on you Austin Subaru,2.8

The recommended window tinting looks great and hitch install was actually done early. Not your typical experience, first time I enjoyed buying a car.",5.0
