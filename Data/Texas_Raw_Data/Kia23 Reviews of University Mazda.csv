0,"May 23, 2019","WOW!! What a dealership!!!  We found a pre-owed Fiat Convertible on line, and it was a perfect fit for us.  We were looking for something to pull behind our Motorhome.  So, here it goes...
We spoke with Danny (salesman), and he was very helpful and friendly, so we set things up to drive to Waco from Dallas.  The car was perfect, so we moved on to Travis in Finance and finished the deal. (less than an hour total) :)  6 hours after we left the dealership, the convertible top broke!!!!  FEAR set in!!  Used Car, As Is, No Warranty.. (you get the picture)  
Our fear was quickly swept away, as they directed us to Greenville Chrysler, but they were unable to repair it.. We agreed to take the car back to Waco, and that's when we met James in the Service Dept. (Nicest person you could ever want to know)  They gave us a BRAND NEW car to drive while they looked into repairing out car.  It took LOTS of research and work, but they repaired the top, and we LOVE the car!!  
People, wherever you live, consider University Mazda Kia for your next new or pre-owed car.  YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPOINTED..  A lot of people say ""I drive a __________"", but we say ""We Drive A University, Mazda Kia""

1,"May 04, 2019",Highly recommend Waco Kia services. Friendly greeting- Josh the Service Manager took Ownership for complete customer satisfaction. Wasn’t sure what was wrong with my car at a total blank. They had me in and out in  very minimum time . Courteous waiting area . Full service form beginning to end.. walked me to my car washed it. And made sure I was satisfied with the whole experience.  Turns out it was just the battery.  Thank you Josh and Waco Kia !!!!,5.0
2,"April 29, 2019","I’ve been going here since it opened.  From Gary the service adviser  to James the service manager to Cliff the mechanic to John the owner...and a few sales staff in between.  University Kia treats me like I’m important and listens to my explanations of things even though they may not make sense.  I recommend this store for sales, service and the personal respect of each and every person that comes through their door.",5.0
3,"April 24, 2019",We loved coming here. We've always purchased our vehicles through Cleve. Rily was fantastic at helping get us in our brand new Telluride. Well definitely be back for another. ,5.0
4,"February 18, 2019","We have never had a bad experience at University Kia.  We get our oil changed every recommended time, they are always helpful, rotate the tires, wash the car, vacuum the car no matter how dirty it is.  There was a computer upgrade for the 2017 Kia and they completed that in less than 30 minutes.  Josh explained what they had done in detail of the service they had provided during our visit.  We were in and out in about an hour.  We had made the appointment at 12 noon and got there at 11:45, they took the car in and we were out before 1:00.  Love this place and when it comes time to buy a new car Kia which is the only vehicle I will buy, I will go to University Kia.  Good job guys. ",5.0
5,"February 08, 2019","Took my van in, due to not being able to open the rear door of the van, I was told the latch was broken and it would cost $280. To repair it. I was told I had to pay for the part first, i asked if they got the door opened and was told no and he didn't even take the panel off, all he did was assume the latch was broken. I  then took my van to MoTech service and performance,  Ray took the panel off and saw that the motor for the latch was the problem, not the latch. Ray had it repaired for way less then what Kia wanted. Thank you MoTech for correctly diagnosing the problem with my van.

6,"February 04, 2019","Josh R. is an excellent Service Manager for Mazda. We have known him for several years as this is the 4th vehicle we have purchased from University MAZDA KIA in Waco. He has always been helpful, knowledgeable, and honest. When he tells you something, you can take it to the bank. He has always had our back.

12,"September 10, 2018",I want to say that the salesman was helpful throughout the process but at within 48 hrs I wondered if I could have exchanged this car for a different model and different color and he told me that was not possible because of the digital transaction from the finance to Kia motors. Even though I was a little disappointed I guess I understood but  completely satisfied. I guess in the future I need to check all other options before I sign. ,4.0

21,"June 16, 2017",Kudos to University!  Josh R.  took our car in and talked with insurance adjustor.  He kept us in the loop about the repairs and returned our car earlier than promised.  He even had it washed and vacuumed for me.  Now that is professionalism personified!  Great service! Great people!,5.0
22,"December 07, 2016","I rate University Mazda excellent based on the excellent customer service I experienced overall but more specifically from my salesperson, Darrin Locking, who went above and beyond by showing me at least 8 different vehicles along with the pros and cons of each. In addition to that he worked out a deal where I traded in a smaller vehicle with I bought from the same dealership 3 months previous with minimum down or out of pocket. Kudo's to Danny Williams in the finance department who was not only professional but very personable as well. These 2 gentlemen made my car buying experience painless. I recommend them and University Kia/Mazda highly.",4.4
