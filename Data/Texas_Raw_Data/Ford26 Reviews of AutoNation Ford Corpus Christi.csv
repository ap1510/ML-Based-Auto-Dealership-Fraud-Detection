0,"September 07, 2019","They charge 150.bucks for a diagnostic. They read the codes from the check engine light, dont do any diagnostic apart from.that, and suggest to do major work.wihout a real idea what is wrong or what caused a failure.
 
Stick with smaller dealers that stand by their product. Autonation us too big to care.

Do not take the extended warranty, it is a total RIP off. They con you and use your fears to sell.you a useless product.

Do not take the oil.change package. Everyone else is cheaper, does better work, and does it while.you wait.

The have no respect for anyone. The mechanics seem to know less about the car than you do.

Sales team in the used side are all white bro types that make sure you know you dont belong there. Very uncomfortable intimidating experience.",1.0

2,"February 13, 2019",Absolutely the worst customer service from a  dealership I have ever had. Took  my 2018 F150 in for a transmission shifting problem 2nd time. They kept it for 2 days. No update. I had to call to find out the status. Only to be told “we could not duplicate it”. I get in the vehicle and leave when it does it immediately. Not to mention they put 49 miles on my truck and gave it back to me with the low fuel light on and “30 miles to empty”. REALLY!!!  Unbelievable!!  Absolutely no excuse for that. UPDATE.  I asked the service adviser to complete a  wheeel alignment check for me.  Service guy calls and says yep you need an alignment. Right side is “toed “ in.  I ask how much. He says normally 129.95. But we have a special for $99.  I said no!   Took my truck to a reputable shop in Rockport. Tech comes to get me and says “ your alignment is perfect”!   I saw the computer screen and it was dead on. WOW.  Be very careful if you use this service department !!!  Highly Unethical People !!!!! Steer clear of this service department!!!,1.0
3,"February 05, 2019","I had my Ford Escape in for it's 15,000 mile check-up, oil change & tire rotation. Also had issues with the sync bluetooth. I spent 6 hours there(& I had an appt.) I was quoted a price of $450. When I went to pay it was $512. They charge a misc fee of $50. I asked what that was for. I was told a disposal fee for rags etc. What? I was not told about this ahead of time. That seems excessive at best. I am not happy & probably will not use them again. And we are planning to buy a new truck by the summer. I will take my business elsewhere if this is how Autonation rips their customers off!!",2.4
4,"October 25, 2018","Service advisor Richard very rude and I stood in front of him for 10 min before he acknowledged me.. he was busy stapling papers!
Service put on new wipers and they were installed incorrectly... ...had to take to another Cadallic dealership to get fixed. 
They put on invoice my tread on tires were yellow which I purchased new tires 3 months ago and again Cadillac dealership said they were incorrect to measure..
Don't recommend this dealership if your a woman.. they will try to RIP you off!!",1.2

6,"February 14, 2018","Made an appointment for my girlfriend's 09 Escape Hybrid on Monday for the following Wednesday morning to check a check engine light. Dropped the car off Wednesday morning no issues.

5 hours later no word on the status of the car. Called for an update and ended up leaving a voicemail asking for a call back. 1 hour later with no word, I called again to get handed off and dropped 3-4 times to finally get told that the vehicle has just been sitting on the lot with no work or inspections done on it.  

Was told ""we'll try to get to it tonight or if not tomorrow morning.""  Asked why it was taking so long since we booked an appointment and was never given a clear answer besides ""making an appointment puts you ahead of walk ins.""  Either they overbooked their services or their mechanics can't keep up with the volume of cars they schedule.

Decided to come in and pick up the car. They made no attempt to save the sale.  Other dealerships I've worked with offered priority service or at least a curtesy car. Never apologized for the inconvenience and was content on watching us drive away. 

My first and last time working with this store.",1.0
7,"September 21, 2017","Awesome! Awesome!! Awesome!!! Absolutely hands down the best place to buy a vehicle! We had such an awesome experience buying our new F-150 from these guys. Joe Balbo, Todd and Arnold were all so helpful and never pushy! I think we got on their nerves more than they got on ours. I had shopped around at multiple places before and after my initial visit here and these guys won us over. We had a maintenance issue with our truck a couple days after purchase, took it in and they took care of us with no questions! That was definitely a first for us. This year hubs got the new truck and we will definitely be back next year for my new truck! ",5.0
8,"September 08, 2017","Our experience with AutoNation Ford, CC, TX has taught us to tread very cautiously when dealing with this dealership. In June, 2017 we purchased a new Ford Expedition. It is now September, 2017 and we are still waiting for our vehicle to be repaired. Repairs relating to factory defects and to the dealership's mishandiling of the vehicle while the vehicle was for sale. We have been (and continue to be) lied to from the financing to the delivery to the service of this vehicle . Upon delivery no one did a vehicle walk-through with us. It is now three months later and we are still disvovering the features of our vehicle. We have had two appointments with our salesperson for a vehicle walk-through, but the salesperson was busy and could not or would not keep his appointments with us.  Albert (Service) has made appointments for our vehicle and when we report on the designated date and time, we are not on the schedule for that day or any other day. The Service Dept. just laughs it off. No one, including the General Mgr., Sales Mgr., Service Mgr. returns our phone calls. We call the dealership to verify that certain managers will be available and when we arrive all of the managers are suddenly unavailable. As I write this review, my husband is at AutoNation Ford in another attempt to resolve this matter. My husband just called me and informed me that he just spoke to the General Manager, Brad, at AutoNation Ford, CC, TX. According to the General Mgr. ""he will have Terri call us and get our vehicle in for service."" He could not give us a date??? In other words, same BS, different day. Now to contact the Attorney General's office.",1.0
9,"February 14, 2017","These people lied to us as soon as we arrived to the moment we left. My son was ready for his first car. They had us wait around for a total of five hours on Saturday to be told we were not approved for a loan. On the way home, which was an hour away, we received a call. We were approved if we paid the TTL. We agreed and they said to come Monday after work and the paperwork would be ready. We went Monday sat for an hour and were then told we were no longer approved. We left very upset and on the way home the manager called and said he thought we were approved but the writing at the bottom of the electronic approval on Saturday stated that he would need to call the bank and explain a situation. He took it upon himself to just tell us we were approved. He is the manager at the used car ford autonation. His name is Daniel. He then told me he had another loan at a lower rate and he would call me the following day once everything was in place. I have not heard a word from this man. These people lie nonstop. They do and say anything to keep you there and to get a sale. They don't care about anyone. My 17 year old son was told over and over he was getting a car. Then he was told twice he was not going to be able to get it. They played with his emotions and didn't give a s---. When I complained many of the salesMEN rolled their eyes and just ignored me. Terrible people. Terrible place. ",1.0
10,"December 31, 2016",Had a great experience at AutoNation Ford Corpus Christi.  Sales rep Jerome was awesome to work with and the first day I met Jerome I knew he was the type of person that I wanted to do business with.  Had an excellent experience with all of the people I dealt with at the dealership and had a positive experience with ordering a new Fusion Sport.  Jerome was the first person that I had talked to at a dealership that really knew about the features of the Fusion Sport.  I always feel like I am being taken care of whenever I am in the dealership or on the phone!,4.8
11,"March 12, 2016","We purchased a used, but relatively new, car from the used car dealership at AutoNation.  Tom Vincent is your stereotypical used car salesman and lived up to it in every essence of the word.  He avoided calls, did things half way, and in some cases straight up lied.  We ended up with a great vehicle, but the service here is not worth going back to.  Stay away!",1.4
12,"March 08, 2016","Do not deal with service advisor Albert at autonation ford in corpus christi. He lies and does not listen to his customer. If you're car needs to be reprogrammed or anything computer related, do not take it there. I brought them a running car and now I have to pick it up because the tech can't figure out what's wrong with it. My car no longer starts, and now leaks oil. I took my car to another dealership to diagnose their mistake. ",1.4
13,"September 01, 2015","I purchased a Mazda CX-9 in July at AutoNation Ford Mazda in Corpus. There were some issues with the title. Had the dealership kept an open line of communication I wouldn't have had any problems but they essentially refused to speak to me from the end of July until the end of August despite numerous phone calls (to the sales manager, the finance manager, and the general manager). It was unbelievably unprofessional and totally uncalled for. I'm reasonable. I understand sometimes there are paperwork issues. Paperwork is my life, I get it, however, I DO NOT understand refusing to talk to a customer who has a 30k+ vehicle they purchased hanging in limbo until they call CORPORATE who has to bully the dealership into taking action. I wouldn't recommend this dealership to ANYONE because they're incredibly unprofessional and obviously need a lesson in customer service 101.",2.0
14,"April 22, 2014","I seen on their internet site a certified 2013 Ford Expedition Limited stock # DEF43965 listed for $34.994.00 and called about this vehicle. The sales person said that they would call me back. This was on 17 April 2014. I waited for 2 hours and decided to go to the dealership. When I got there I handed the sales person a copy of the internet ad on their web site. He said that he had to talk with his manger. When  returned he told me that the car sold that morning. I returned home and the next day I was searching their web site and seen the exact car listed for $39,991. I called the General Manager Randy and explained that the same car was listed yesterday and what the sales person told me. I also told him that the VIN matched as well as their stock number on their web site. He said that he would look into this and return my call. He never called back and when I tried to call a few hours later they said that he was out for the day. These people lie and will not answer you when you catch them. As you can see it starts at the top. I am a woman and they discriminate. Be very careful when dealing these people. They lie and deceive. I am thinking of taking this to a lawyer. I have both internet ads printed showing the exact vehicle with different listing prices.",1.0
15,"August 05, 2013",Don't buy a used vehichle here that needs any body work and steer clear of Tom Vincent. Very disappointed with the quality of repairs and trying to get answers out of my saleman. I felt like the truck was patched up just long enough for the sale.,1.6
16,"June 22, 2013","We were intersted in a Ford F150, my husband and I walked the entire lot looking at trucks and finally just sat around waiting for help.  Chris finally helped us.  His overall knowledge of the vehicle was average.  When we finally sat down to look at numbers, we came to an agreement, until i noticed their internet price was almost $5000 cheaper!  I asked them to price match it.  After much confusion, they offered to price match.  The next day when we went to pick up our truck, all of a suddent things changed.  The Finance Manger was one of the rudest individuals I have ever had to meet when buying a car.  Sadly, they did not earn our business - nor will we ever visit again.  Save yourself sometime - go somewhere else!",2.2
17,"May 14, 2013",Emmanuel and Jeremy were great. Jeremy kept in touch with me the entire time. They both answered all my questions and concerns about purchasing my first car. They made my experience a great one. Thanks again guys! You're the best! ,5.0
18,"March 26, 2013","I enjoyed buying a vehicle at Champion Ford Mazda because they had the exact style of truck I was looking for.  Even though their prices were probably not the best, their friendliness and promptness was very attractive.",4.6
19,"December 04, 2012","It was my good fortune to have been assisted in my search for a used vehicle by Mr. Mack Smith, Sales Associate, Champion Ford.  He was friendly, professional, and knowledgeable but, more importantly, he listend to me and my stated needs in a vehicle.  Together, he and I completed the search, agreed on pricing, and got all the paperwork completed in one day.

I would like to add that my prior experiences with Champion Mazda Service were not as pleasant and made me reticent to deal with Champion. As they are seperate dealerships, I'm hoping that any Champion Ford Service experiences will be of a less stressful nature.  Mr. ""Mack"" assures me that his customer services doesn't end when I drive the car off the lot.  I trust this is true. 

Thanks, Mack",4.5
20,"October 15, 2012",Tony was great with customer service he greeted me asked me what I was looking for took me to the vechlies I was interested in closed the dealer without hassel and I was out and in my new truck in under 3 hours,5.0
21,"September 24, 2012",KEN AND ERIC WERE VERY HELPFUL IN HELPING ME TO MAKE A DECISION ON WHICH FORD TRUCK TO BUY. THEY GAVE ME SEVERAL OPTIONS AND PRICES. The financing was great! I was so empressed I sent my boss to see Ken about a new truck.,5.0
22,"September 18, 2012",from the first contact Mr Perez was resourcefull- cooperative and honest - got a great price followed by excellent service - they even delivered the car to my home and sent a representative to answer any questions i may have had-  went as far as to set up my mobile phone to the blue tooth - you cannot go wrong with Champion - thanks again ,5.0
23,"September 12, 2012",Daniel was very professional and pleasant to work with. Great customer service.  He was easy to work with and made every effort to. Make our experience efficient and effective.,4.6
24,"September 11, 2012","I'm sorry I had to rate the customer service as bad.  I had to make several attempts to get someone to help me.  It was worth the wait though because Reye Flores was very helpful and knowledgeable about the Ford Mustang that I was interested in.  He turned the buying experience into a pleasant one which I would totally do again.  My daughter and I are really enjoying my new vehicle.  Thanks Reye, you rock!",3.4
25,"August 21, 2012","Enjoyed our Sales Person Tony one of the BEST I have ever worked with, I would highly recommend him to any of my Friends! I am glad we had our Financing pre-approved with NavyArmy C/U so we would know what we could afford to spend & about what our payments would be. This is a very important Tool to have so you know what your Budget will be & Tony did all he could to Guide us so we could make this possible. I know why he has received many Top Sales Awards, again the BEST!!!!! 

Thank You also to Gary for his kindness through out many years of Business with my Family.",5.0
