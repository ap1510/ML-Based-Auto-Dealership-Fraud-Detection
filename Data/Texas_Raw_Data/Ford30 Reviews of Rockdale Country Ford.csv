6,"August 26, 2018",We went to at least half a dozen dealerships. Finally we went to Rockdale Ford. Our salesman Ben and the finance manager Brian went over and above on the customer service. These guys found us the truck I wanted at the price I needed to stay under with a lot of options. This by far has been the best new vehicle experience we ever had. I would rate this dealership as one of if not the best dealership in Texas. Excellence in every category is my rating for this dealership. I would recommend Rockdale Ford to anyone looking to get a new vehicle. ,5.0

17,"January 02, 2018","The entire staff at Rockdale Country Ford are so friendly and can best be described as professional and customer oriented. From the moment I was greeted by my professional sales associate, Andrew, I was treated with total respect and did not feel pressured to “make a deal” at any point during my time spent looking for my new 2017 Ford F-350 SD Diesel. 

Once I made the decision to purchase from Rockdale Country Ford, they continued to make the entire process as stress free as possible.

Great job to the entire team and you can bet I’ll be back when I’m ready to trade for another new truck!

27,"July 04, 2015","Purchased a CERTIFIED used car.  Prior to purchase we had great customer service.  When we picked up the car, four hours from our home and in pouring rain, I was guaranteed everything worked.  Salesman told me the car was taken to ""sister Chevy dealership"" to verify everything?  On our way home it was apparent the AC did not work. I assumed it needed to be charged. Wrong!  Cost me 1700 dollars to fix the AC system, new compressor.  Also two transmission hoses were bad and needed a transmission flush- fluid looked like oil.  My husband immediately contacted the dealer to negotiate what could be done.  The salesman was not able to help and told my husband he would need to talk with the manager.  After many attempts to call the manager my husband told him the situation.   The manager told my husband he would talk the issue over with the owner.  After that none of my husbands calls have been returned.  When my husband calls excuses are made.  Bottom line- we are stuck with the total bill and without the customer service promised.  I understand the car had no warrenty but I believe they had to know the AC did not work.  Certified apparently means nothing at this dealership.  Be very careful you check everything fully.  If there is a problem once you drive off the lot your customer service will end.  We are in the process of a BBB complaint as well.  We have been happy used car purchasers before but not from this dealership.",2.8
28,"January 18, 2015",This review has nothing to do with the great sales staff. It has to do with the service dept. I recently took my vehicle to the dealer to have the second oil change done and tires rotated. After reviewing the invoice I found that the service department put Quaker State oil in my vehicle. It did not come from the factory with that oil and I did not expect them to put that type of oil in. The service department did not rotate the tires as indicated to keep my road hazard warranty intact. I am considering taking my vehicle to another dealer for my service as I can not trust Rockdale Ford to do the work that is required. ,2.0
29,"May 12, 2014",This is the best place to buy a Ford.  We had a great experience and the people we so down to earth.  Thank you Rockdale Country Ford.,5.0
