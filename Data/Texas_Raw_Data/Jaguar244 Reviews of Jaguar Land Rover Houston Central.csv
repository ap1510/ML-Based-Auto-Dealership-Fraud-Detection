You have a hard time with them fulfilling their promise. Make sure everything that is promised to be done on your vehicle is done before you sign contract or drive home or you would get the run around. ,2.0

3,"May 26, 2020","They did my scheduled service in a day and communicated thoroughly.  Only drawback is that there's not a loaner car program. The only options are to get dropped/picked or use their shuttle service. The shuttle service is good, but extremely inefficient. Be prepared to wait a while if you're using the shuttle service. ",3.8
4,"May 20, 2020","We had a good experience with Cesar, he was very knowledgeable and answered all of our questions.  When it came to signing our paperwork, we had to wait a very long time, even though we sent in our application ahead of time to avoid waiting.  Once it was time to drive off, I didn't receive a lot of instructions on how to set my seat preferences, bluetooth, etc.  A follow-up call would've also been nice to see how I was liking the car or if I had any questions.

then found out the new car i purchased had in fact been with the dealer for close to a year, and that they had not even bothered to check the battery before delivering the car to me, ( I would expect that this should a a standard requirement from Jaguar)

Needless to say i am extremely disappointed with the dealership, basically sold me a non functioning car, now I just have to hope they can fix it in a reasonable time.

My car was serviced at Land Rover the entire life of the car and they still refused to pay in full for the engine replacement or acknowledge the car was defective from the beginning.  They nor their dealer stand behind their product and there is no recognition of customer loyalty.  They have no consideration for building repeat business with their customers, once they take your money they are done with you and will keep taking your money with no reciprocation at the first sign of real trouble.

60,"October 24, 2018","I could give this place ZERO stars if I could. I am in the market to buy a new SUV and was considering the Discovery Sport HSE. 

After having spoken to a sales rep on the phone I walked in the showroom at the agreed time only to find out that he had LEFT FOR THE DAY??!! He was called by the lady at the reception and he actually came back (after I wasted about 30 mins) - but I was glad to see that he believed in customer service. This was the ONLY piece of good service.

His first question was what was my budget? When I told him a range I had in mind (and it wasn't some ridiculous number), his first reaction was - sorry I don't think we can sell you the car. It seemed like he had pre-conceived notions. My reasons for the ONE star are: 
1. I was not offered a test drive of the car
2. After wasting an hour of my time, the sales rep and his Finance Manager did not seem interested in working with me even when I assured them that I could buy the car that day
3. The Finance Manager did not honor the price as advertised on their website and kept running numbers on a different car. 
4. At first the sales rep showed me a partial picture of a lease deal which was 20% higher than that advertised on their website. When I pulled up the Land Rover website and showed them the details he looked astonished and there was NO APOLOGY for trying to fool a customer with the wrong number??!!

I had heard of bad service from Land Rover / Range Rover but I thought that would be during maintenance. I was SURPRISED by the lack of customer service at the time of buying a luxury car. I have owned and driven BMWs and Audis and there is NO COMPARISON to the level of service they offer from the time you enter the showroom till the time you drive out and own the car and even after you have stopped owning it!",1.0

The service manager calls and said that he would  send me out a new quote.  The new quote said the spec on the front rotors were within code so they could install  the pads only.but would change rotors and pads for 645.00 I replied to email only front pads. I also  ask for a new quote for pads only.  I received a phone call from Gloria saying my car was ready and the price was 621.00 I asked  question why it 621.00 for pads .Before hanging up she replied talk with service manager.. He calls and threaten to take the new pads off and cut ties with me.. He claim he made mistake on the email. They couldn't change the back because rotors under spec and the car unsafe to drive on the back. But willing to place the old pads back and allow me to drive away.
I ask to speak with manager. He stated I'm the manager. Everybody has someone above them. He finally gave me a name.

My experience was the complete opposite. From the moment I set foot at the dealership I received the most professional and courteous treatment one can expect.

Once I ordered the car with the specifications I wanted, she constantly kept me informed of the timeline. I felt I was at the best hands.
I highly recommend this dealership!!

Car ready at 5:30, after calling all day for a readiness ETA. Waited 45 minutes for car to finish being ""washed"". $816 to fix a tail light. When I asked why it took 10 hours to fix, with a 7:30 appt, I was told appointments just allow them to the schedule their day ... nothing to do with when my car service starts. Contacted the General Manager to discuss ... 4 weeks later, no discussion. I expected so much more from Land Rover! So frustrated and disappointed.",2.0

When we decided on a couple cars we were interested in, he got the keys and started both cars so it wasn’t so hot.  He was very knowledgeable about the cars we were considering.  Once we decided on the car that we wanted to purcase, he made the process pretty easy and he was very helpful with assisting us with getting information.   We felt no pressure.  We explained where we wanted to be and they did what they could to make that happen.  Once we were with Suzette, it went pretty quickly.  She was very friendly and made us very comfortable with our purchase.  She explained all of the options we had and she went over our paper work in detail to explain all of the fees line by line.  After we purchased the car, AJ met us outside with our new car. He placed the temporary tag on and showed us different function of the car, which helped a lot.

170,"November 25, 2017","One of the first things the sales manager said to me was that there is a disclaimer on the ad. 
The disclaimer says: Cars.com disclaimer: The information on vehicles provided in these services is supplied by the seller or other third parties. Cars.com is not responsible for the accuracy of such information. Cars.com provides this service and materials without representation or warranties of any kind, either expressed or implied.
	I told him there are things listed in the vehicle that aren’t actually in the vehicle. He said the people who do the ads look up the VIN and then list what is in it, I told him that I don’t think they checked the VIN because if they had they would of known what is in the vehicle. I believe, they saw Anniversary Edition and went with the first one that came up, which is the top of the line Anniversary Edition. I know of 2 different Anniversary Edition. Each of them have different equipment in them.
	I tried to show him the 2 different Anniversary Editions but he didn’t want to see the differences. He told me again that they ran the VIN number. Then I tried to show him the sale ads. He took the 2 ads I had and then saw the Cargurus ad and said they don’t do cargurus, that they took the ad from cars.com and listed it to make it look like they had more than they really had.
	I mentioned that the price of the van included those items listed in the ad, and he said “No it doesn’t, that is the price of the van.”	
	I told him that they listed the van with those items and that they were not in the van but if they gave me a stereo with a Navigation system in it I would call it even. He said that they won’t do that .He also said that they were going out of their way to accommondate me again with touching up the bad spots on the van. He had the attitude like he did a bunch of things for me, which he didn’t, other than touching up the back of the van.
	To sum up with my talk to the sales manager:
He lied to me 4 times in about a 10 minute talk and then he asked the salesman Elton, “how much longer until her van is done” Elton said he would check on it but thought it should be almost done. I was there over an hour after that.
	The lies:
3 times telling me that the people in charge of the sale ad information ran the VIN number,

4th lie was that “equipment list I the vehicle does not put more cost to the vehicle.

	I went to the Chrysler web site and ran the VIN for that van and got the equipment list for that van. No Navigation system listed. No Dual DVD/Blue Ray listed and no 3rd row 9” VGA screen listed.
	So if they ran the VIN they would of seen that.
	I got the feeling the Sales Manager wanted me out of the Dealership because I challenged him about the False Sale Ad. I wanted out of there just as bad.
	A couple of days before my talk with the Sales Manager, he had sent my husband an email thanking him for his purchase and that he would like to make sure that we are happy, if not please let him know and he would see about making it happen. WHAT A JOKE.

171,"November 02, 2017","Primary reason to bring in my range rover supercharge was because when driving vehicle for 30 minutes on highway then letting of gas, the vehicle starts missing really bad, jerks severely due to missing, loss of speed and ability to increase speed making it extremely dangerous to drive.
It appears that the injectors are being choked off from gas which could be a gas or injection regulator as I found out by searching online.

When I took in the vehicle they said they could not find why this was happening and could not duplicate it, however they were able to do the service that was due, which never was indicated with any warning in the vehicle. 
I assured them it was a major problem, however they didn't do anything about it. I left the dealership and before I got home it was missing bad again. I called service rep ""Jay"" who put me on phone with head mechanic who said they probably needed to drive it longer to duplicate what was happening and that they couldn;t fix something they can't duplicate. 
So I told them I needed to bring it back in however I would need a loaner vehicle or rental which they said ok and transferred me to another line where I was on hold for 45 min and no one ever came on. I tried again and nothing again. No one ever called me back. The vehicle continues the missing today. I called to let them know I was bringing it back in today and requested a rental or loaner, which I was told they did not have anything. So I was told the service rep would call me after lunch. 
I now have to take it in, find a ride, and hope they will fix it and not try to charge me an arm and leg for their inability to diagnose an issue of their vehicle.

Luxury  vehicle, over priced, poor performance, terrible customer service, 2 re-calls already. 

I drive mercedes and will go back to them and never purchase a Land Rover product again.

176,"March 14, 2017","Why I won’t have another Jaguar and it isn’t due to the quality of the car.  It is due to the service at Jaguar Houston Central 

Early December 2016 my 2013 Jaguar XK told me it needed new brake pads so I made a service appointment.  After taking the care in on December 19, I was told it would take a couple hours so I decided to wait.  An hour or so later they came out and said they noticed the water pump was leaking and since it was under warranty they were just going to fix that.  This meant the car wouldn’t be ready until the next day so they took me home.  This was no issue or hassle to me at all.  So far I was still very happy with the dealership.

The next day I got a call that they were having trouble getting the water pump off so it may take a couple days.  They offered to get me a loaner car which I took them up on. Again, so far I was still happy with them.  The next day(12/21)  I received a call that they had broken a boldttrying to get the water pump off and were trying to determine the best way to go forward.  It would be another few days.  Now I am not so happy because this wasn’t a quality issue with the car but human error in breaking the bolt.  But I do understand that sometimes things happen.

The service rep informed me on 12/22 that they were needed to take the engine out of the car to attempt drilling the bolt out of the engine block.  The engine in my car needed removed due to human error which seriously concerned me.  

The engine was sent to a machine shop to remove the bolt and when it was returned around 1/23, the service rep informed me the service manager wasn’t happy with the repair and that I would probably need a new engine.  Then on 2/2 they called to tell me my car would be ready the next day and they were able to put the original engine back in.  

Here is the part where I have lost all faith in the service at this Jaguar dealer and in the car maker itself since they allow this to happen.  I wanted the service center to provide an extended warranty on the engine/drivetrain since the engine was removed due to human error on their part.  The service manager refused and then would not even offer to SELL me a warranty since my car was now under 3 months of the original warranty expiring.  My car was NOT 3 months away from the original warranty expiring when they broke the bolt, but was when they finally had a resolution.  If they had confidence in their repair, an extended warranty is a pretty cheap way for them to stand behind their work.  But they would not which is an indication of how they think this will hold up.

My wife and I tend to keep our cars 7-10 years and since Jaguar doesn’t make the XK anymore, I fully intended to keep it a long time.  My wife has been a long time Mercedes Benz owner but was considering the F-Type.  I had been a Jaguar proponent since purchasing the XK.  Both of these things have now changed due to this service experience.  I will go back to being a Porsche customer and my wife will probably stay a Mercedes owner going forward.  I will make sure I express my feelings about Jaguar, based on the service experience to anyone I can.

By not standing behind their work and putting the full risk on me they have lost me as a potential customer and have turned my positive feelings about the car into extremely negative feelings.  Feelings that I will not hesitate to share whenever I have the opportunity.  This experience was not due to the quality of the car, but to human error by the service department.  And they refused to stand behind that work with any warranty and refused to offer me a warranty I could purchase.  That tells me a lot.

I have no complaints about Renee the service advisor.  She did what she could.

Carson Bryant and this dealership went out of their way to successfully make me happy in all aspects of this purchase. Actually, in my opinion, they went beyond my expectations correcting some concerns that I had that were identified and pointed out to them after I took delivery of the car. They did not have to do this but they did without any hesitation or resistance. How this car looked at the end was as important to them as it was to me - regardless of whether the deal was still open or closed. Bottom line - My happiness was important to them.

I wanted to make sure the higher payment was not going to effect this process.  I placed the CC hold on a Tuesday night.  Wednesday morning, my mortgage lender told me to hold off just to make sure.  I notified my salesperson (Cecily Ojeda) at 8:15am that I would need to hold off a few hours until I could work on the mortgage situation and needed to make sure all was in order.  By 12:30 pm, I was given the OK to proceed.  I immediately contacted Cecily to let her know I was good to go and that I would be down within the next two days.  I told them to process my CC authorization.  I was then told by Cecily that her manager, ""Randy"" would not allow them to hold the car any longer and that they had other people coming to look at the car later in the day.  I informed them that I would like to purchase the car barring any un-forseen issues and that I would be down by 5pm the following day to complete the deal.  They completely refused to hold the car for 24 hours so I could come down and buy it.  I was the first one interested and had finalized all particulars, including a credit app with their finance department.  I even contacted the General Manager, Jason Lacher, leaving a voicemail for him.  He did not return my phone call.  They refused to give me first dibs and sold the car out from underneath me without letting me know someone else wanted to buy the car.

My name is Angela Williams, and on Saturday, December 7th, I purchased a  Land Rover Range Rover from your dealership. My salesman was Mr. Carson Bryant. He was fantastic! Buying a vehicle is at best taxing and time-consuming: therefore, having a knowledgeable and honest salesman is indeed rare.  And on top of that, having the extra bonus of feeling a personal bond with this individual is even more unique. My husband was also impressed with his ability to please me, without the pressure of buying. Carson made the entire experience of purchasing my Range Rover, along with trading in my Yukon, effortless.

This is the second vehicle we’ve purchased from your dealership!  I would definitely recommend your business to others and will check your inventory if I am in the market for another vehicle.  

Sincerely,

Angela Williams

203,"October 05, 2013","During the beginning of the Summer I had been to several Land Rover dealerships in the Dallas and Houston area. Although I knew what I wanted to purchase, I couldn't just find that bond and trust in a salesman that made me feel confident enough to justify my decision to purchase a new vehicle from that specific dealership. A couple weeks later I was online looking for salesmen with outstanding credentials based on their reviews from previous customers, thats where I found Carson. I sent him a brief email stating who I was and what I wanted to purchase. I soon received a response from him telling me who he was and what he could do for me to get the process going. Within the next several days we were in contact on the phone talking about my new purchase. The entire time Mr. Bryant was very respectful towards me as well as excited for me. I was making a custom order for an LR4 so it would take some time to receive my order, but Carson made me confident that I was in good hands. I'd like to say that it wasn't until several months later that I actually met Carson in person for the first time. I only mention this because we did everything from talking about my purchase, finding out new information, and just checking up on my cars status all from the phone and email. When my LR4 came in I flew over to IAH. He kindly picked my up from the airport, shook my hand, and drove me to their dealership. Immediately Carson and I already headed it off in conversation, connecting in the way any customer would always want. During the entire time I was at the dealership getting everything together Carson made me truly feel respected. He walked me thought all the cars features, congratulating me on my purchase, and gave me a friendly farewell when I departed. Since then I stay in touch sending him pictures of all the fun things I've done in my car. We still have a positive relationship and I have already considered purchasing yet another vehicle from him for another member of the family. All this started from his excellent customer reviews. This guy is the real deal. His customer service, quality of work, friendliness, and his help towards my purchase all deserve to be the standard of how a customer should feel. Obviously I couldn't fit what I truly wanted to say in this review, but I can say with confidence that this man is the real deal. If your looking into a purchase, DO NOT pass up on this guy. Mr. Bryant exceeded my expectations and deserves your attention.              ",5.0
204,"October 04, 2013","I found an amazing deal on an Audi Q7 on LRHC's ebay Motors page. I looked at the vehicle on their dealership website and noticed that it was priced a few thousand dollars more. Given the low mileage and low price (on eBay Motors), I told my wife that we needed to see this SUV first thing in the morning.

We arrived within minutes of the dealership floor opening and Carson was asked to assist us. He was extremely friendly and very personable. I showed him a printout of the eBay Motors page and even he was surprised by the price. Management agreed to honor the price (but immediately updated the eBay price in case we decided to walk). It took a while for him to find the vehicle, but we went on a quick test drive and my wife loved the vehicle -- therefore, we decided to go ahead with the purchase.

Given that I was already pre-qualified on the loan and we knew the vehicle we wanted to purchase, it still took longer than I was expecting to purchase the vehicle (3 hours). Carson initially said that we were supposed to receive two sets of keys; nevertheless after signing the ""dealership don't owe you anything paper,"" Carson was unable to find the second set of keys. That was annoying as it costs a lot of money to replace a set of keys. The vehicle also mysteriously only had 3 carpet mats rather than 4. It seems odd that one would go missing. I called Audi and a replace set costs ~$150.

We ended up financing through LRHC because they were able to knock 0.25% off the loan rate since they were a preferred dealership with out bank -- happy about that. We avoided the upsell by the finance rep, which was expected (given my last purchase from an Audi dealership).

Overall, I found Carson to be pleasant to work with. I would recommend him to others who are considering a vehicle from LHRC.",4.5

227,"August 05, 2012","I am in the process of working with the Consumer Protection division of the Attorney General's office to file a claim against this dealership for their deceitful practices which I believe violate our state's fair trade practices act.  I am also contacting Jaguar USA about this particular dealership's practices and Kenny Wright in particular. BEWARE OF THIS DEALERSHIP - in particular do not deal with KENNY WRIGHT; judging from our experience we believe he engages in deceitful practices.  DO NOT BUY FROM HERE.  What they did to us sure feels like bait and switch.  Additionally they showed us a car that they later told us we couldn't buy because it was under contract (had received a deposit) with another buyer.  The entire week we spent dealing with them seemed fishy in general. Two of the three cars that they originally told me were available for purchase amazingly weren't available on Saturday morning when we went in.  Fine.  Things sometmes happen.  This could all very well have been on the up and up.  We then went to look at the one remaining car, test drove it, we weren't sure about it so we walked away, 90 minutes later changed our minds and expressed our interest.  Their Sales Manager (Kenny Wright) sent us an email in a condescending tone (his whole tone in person and via email is extremely condescending) the gist of which implied that a magical buyer from out of state had mysteriously resurrected and had made a down payment.  It's amazing they were able to get a bank wire transfer for deposit on a Saturday evening from out of state within a 90 minute period.  I'd sure like to bank there.   Very fishy.  He is VERY SLIMY to deal with - as well as generally unprofessional and impolite.  I thought that by buying a used car from a Jaguar/Land Rover dealership that I'd escape some of the *yuck* factor of buying a used car from a more common dealership.  Not the case.  This has been the single worst car buying experience of my life.  It seems as though they are in the business of NOT wanting to sell you a car.  In fact, I'd say he was antagonistic during the whole process.  He barely even bothered with any semblance of politeness.   He also seems not to care very much about his personal appearance.  I would think Jaguar would like their Sales Team (Sales Manager in particular) to at least be clean shaven and not disheveled.  The only reason I mention this is because I suppose it shouldn't be a surprise to be treated disrespectfully by someone who appears to take no pride in his own self.  I'm surprised Jaguar would let this guy represent the Jaguar name.   I did copy the General Manager in on most of our communications with Kenny but he remained mostly silent and at no point stepped in to try to salvage any of the sales.  By the way, I had been a loyal customer of this dealership's service department for years and walked in with pre-approved financing (we also could have paid cash but they did not need to know that), so I'm not a random person off the street.  Also, if you are a woman do not deal with this dealership.  Based on my interaction with Kenny, he strikes me as a a bit of an old fashioned, slightly less evolved type, who holds women in low regard.   There is one Jaguar salesman there that was extremely helpful - his name was Rick.  He was polite to us, friendly and knowledgable - downright pleasant.  Unfortunately for some reason we were dealing with Kenny.   

I do not wish to completely throw this dealership under the bus.  They do have an excellent service department headed by Dexter Taylor who has always gone above and beyond in terms of customer service as well as a service consultant, Stephen Almond, whom I've had the pleasure of working with for a few years.  I was simply SHOCKED to be treated the way I was by the sales team (Kenny in particular, as well as Brittany) given the quality of service I've received from their repair team over the years.  All this could have been avoided had they simply sold us the used car we went in to buy instead of making up a story about phantom buyers suddenly appearing from out of state with magical bank transfers happening on Saturday evenings within 2 hours of us walking out.  Shame on you Jaguar Central.  We'll see how the attorney general's office feels about their seemingly deceptive practices as well as how Jaguar USA feels about this particular dealership's representation of the Jaguar name.  Also, I forgot to mention that they did not disclose two safety issues with the car we were looking at.  They were both issues that unless you specifically looked for them you wouldn't likely discover until later on.  Once we pointed out the issues to them they admitted to having known about one but not about the other.  I'm not sure if they're required to point these out by law or not, but just thought I'd make mention of it.  It seems to me they would have caught both safety issues when doing their 140 point check.  Could have been an honest mistake, who knows, but worth pointing out.",1.5
228,"May 04, 2012","I went to the dealership to look for a 2010 onwards Range Rover (HSE or Supercharged). The salesperson was extremely friendly and helpful and was great at follow ups. I ended up going for a new BMW 750Li sedan as opposed to an SUV but if I am again in the market for an SUV, I would definitely contact this salesperson. The prices (at least) on the used vehicles at this dealership were excellent and lower than any other dealership. ",5.0

Because it was imperative for me to get to work, at the time of scheduling, I confirmed with the scheduler twice that they would have a loaner car for me to drive and they said yes.  I got to the dealership for the SCHEDULED service and was told that they had no car for me to drive and I could wait or take the shuttle.  I left. Simply misleading and dishonest.",1.0
230,"March 24, 2011","I took my 2006 Land Rover Sport into the dealership to have a key replaced.  I got the car back with a new key and a whole new set of safety problems. The Day after I got the car back I drove to take my daughter to a soccer game two miles from my house.. Within 1 block every warning signal in the car began to flash.  The signals the, the flashers, the gas light, everything and then it shifts down into second gear.  I approached the next stop sign and turned the car off. Then It wouldn't start.  

I called the dealership and they told me that the car was adjusting to the new key.  The Solution was to turn the steering wheel from left to right and give it a minute.  This went on for a few weeks.  My car was now the most unreliable thing I had ever owned.  I would go around the corner to buy groceries and end up sitting in a car full of groceries in 100 weather trying to start what used to be my dream car.  I had to call friends to pick me up from appointments when my car wouldnt start after hours of trying the ""turn to the left and the to the right Solution""  This was last June.  JUNE 2010.  Today Is March 24th 2011 and my car is still there.  

I got my car back from them three times during the last 10 months and each time they told me that it was fixed within 24-48 hrs I was stuck in a parking lot or caught on a freeway only able 30mph due to the down shift.

I worked with Steven In the service department.  He was nice but  not effective.  Around the 7-8 month point Steven informed me that the car was in pieces on the service department and that they were still trying to find the problem.  I never received a call from the Service Manage once during the first 8 months of this disaster. As a matter of fact when I finally called him he was not even aware of the problem my car was having. He told me that they have service meetings every week on the cars in the service dept.  But when I talked to him , He didn't know how long it had been there and was unaware that the original request was to have a key replaced.  He was shocked the car was there for so long.  Also, he was unaware that 

The next person to talk to was the GM.  Jason Walker. He knows even less than Dexter. When Discussing the issue with him, he said mam' your car has only been here for 8 weeks.  I said no! Its been there for 8 months. I have been very patient until this point hoped that this can be fixed. When I lost all faith and patients I asked to be reimbursed for the service charges that I had already paid.  First I spend 30-40 minutes on two separate calls with Dexter hoping to get a check cut because he asked me to let him be the mediator.  I didnt realize I needed a mediator between myself and a GM I had never spoken with.  Dexter told me that he would see what he could do.  When he called me back he said that they would reimburse me for teh service but not the key or the battery that they changed.  First of all the key obviously didnt work and We tried to jump the car many many times and the car never made a noise.  The battery was not the problem and changing it didnt fix the issue.  So at that point I was our about $300 for those two items and I still had no car.

I decided to talk with the GM My self and it took three days for him to return my call.  I have decided at this point I dont want the car back.  Its in pieces and who knows what state it will be in reassembled?

 I bought my car for 30,500 cash,, It ws paid of had low mileage and drove perfectly now he wants to give me only 25,000 for the car and will only pay the what the tax will be if I trade the car in with them.  Who in their right mind would buy another Land Rover if this is what there is to deal with should a problem arise.  God help me if I were to loose another key. 

I have had to debate both Dexter and Jason Walker on every issue. I feel like I should be paid in full for the services.  I think that the dealership should be ashamed of the way I have been strung along for 10 months.  I dont its fair that my time has been wasted dealing with the incompetence and lack of customer service.  They have given me an unsafe care to drive three times when they insisted that it was fixed.  I think the offer of 2$5,000 is a joke.  I think its unfair that now I have to go out and find a car for $25,000 and pay the taxes which means I am really working with $23000 and still I loose $300 on a key and battery that I never received.  Jason has cut corners and passed the buck since our very first phone call.  At this point I am out a car 300 plus 5,500 and a car that was fully paid for.  This has been the worst experience I have ever had.  I have asked them for 29,500.  Jason Walker said that he has to ask another guy that works there. He said it most likely wont happen he said but he will try to get me more.  Kelly Blue Book has this yr, make and model with 62,000 miles at 27,550.  Jason told me that Kelly Blue Book is not always correct in pricing, they are a tool he said but not the best way to price a car. When I mentioned that other dealers said that 25,000 is a really low price, he said he would take the car to them if they were willing to pay more.  And he said it like he was doing me a favor.  I cant believe he had the nerve to put this problem in my lap again  Also take into consideration that  if I was told that I couldnt be fix and we were still in 2010 even Kelly Blue book would price it higher.  I have been screwed all around.  This is how this situation can be fixed. I want $29,500 paid in full within a week not another two week or another month. After all of the car problems, my time, my patients, missed appointments, soccer games, ruined groceries, having to sit in a 120 degree car turning a wheel from side to side like someone is playing a mean joke on me while I have my daughter with me, the loss of a paid for vehicle; this is fare and they should be happy Im not calling the news and plastering this incompetent story on the 9 ""o"" Clock news.

Deceitful salesmen.  Bad dealership.  Don't believe their lies.

1) I found one of their listings at cars.com that I was interested in.

2) I called 877-661-3144 - their ""direct esales number""
- the first time, the wait was over 5 minutes.  I hung up.

3) I called again about 20 minutes later.  I talked to someone I think that was named Shelly.  
We talked for a while.  She said that she would send me more pictures on this specific car by email and more information.

She didn’t send the information.

4) I submitted an online request to see the car.

5) At 9:39AM I got a call from 281-892-0650 from a Shelly/Sherri saying the car was available and my appointment would be “on the calendar.” 

6) That day I spoke with Jennifer Day 3 times on the “live chat system” and was very specific in wanting to make this appointment “easy.”  I wanted to know whom to ask for when arriving, re-confirm the car was available, and finally, move the appointment from 12:15PM until 11:00AM. 

At about 10:45AM, she told me 1) the car was available, 2) When arriving ask for “Dana.”

7) When my wife arrived at the dealership, less than 20 minutes after I disconnected from Jennifer Day, she learned that
a) The car is pending sale (not available for sale)
b) “Dana” doesn't work at the dealership, so asking for her to show her the car didn’t work.
c) The car was not at the location.

So - the lesson is - don't believe Jaguarhoustoncentral com - because when it looks like they have a deal, they're lying to you.

Tom called me back with in 10 minutes to say that the car was sold to someone else. The car was worth $32,000 and 2 weeks ago I bough a car at Valley Honda which was only a $9,000 car and was a suzuki Vitara.

240,"April 21, 2010","For information purposes.
For a little background I have owned Land Rovers since I did start driving: locally and abroad. That makes it about 20+ years. I own 3 LRs, so I have done my homework thoroughly. 
Very bad experience at that Land Rover Central location (Old Katy). Pity they have been around for such long time here in Houston, and their quality in most all aspects have been gone way below the positive scale. The sense I did get was that these people has been “sleeping in their laurels”. Lucky they are very close to high-end areas. Most likely, their arrogance has taken over the principles of customer satisfaction, and to strive for the best, which is contrary to what Land Rover represents. Their sales people starting by Mr. Kevin Lind (Sales Manager) really leave too much to be desired as far customer treat and courtesy. Sales personal is very pushy. Prices are not good at all, and on top of that, it is clearly noted that the right hand does not know what the left hand is doing, since Mr. Myron Heronema (OP Mngr.) has a capital “V” (for Vague) printed on his forehead. Kind of scary. So do not waste your time going there. Or perhaps stop by for “benchmark” purposes. Then, you will notice that either Southwest Momentum or Land Rover Houston North will speak by themselves right at the moment you step-in. Good Luck!!!
