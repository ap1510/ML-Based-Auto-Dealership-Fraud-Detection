1,"June 08, 2020","Spoke to a sales guy regarding getting a trade in value for our vehicle. Sales guy mentioned to see what Honda would give us since it’s not a Subaru, in turn, giving “more ammunition” to talk to his manager when giving their value. Arrived for my appointment with the information they wanted and walked into him bickering with another sales associate (female) about who’s customer I am. Waited for that to end and the female went straight into, what vehicle are we going to test drive so she can get the keys. I informed her, I was just looking and wondering what the trade in value would be since I have information from other dealers per Subaru’s request so maybe they could be in the same ball park. Nothing wrong with shopping around. She responds, they won’t get a used car manager involved until I test drive and pick a vehicle. I told her, I’ve been to two other dealerships and i did not have to test drive anything. We talked possible numbers and they encouraged me shopping around. She then responded, As I said, we won’t be getting a used car manager in until you pick a car you want to buy and test drive it. I told her, I was still interested in the cross trek as mentioned the day before but I do not want to test drive at this time. I then explained, if I have to test drive and go through the motions of sitting around while you drum up paperwork, I’m good to go because I’m not here to waste anyone’s time. I went to walk out and she said, “just wait here, I’ll get my manager.“ We walked out of the building and waiting about 5 minutes. She came back out and said she needed to get the VIN and mileage to do an appraisal, then asked for the keys. I handed them off, not thinking, and she started to walk inside. I told her that the car is sitting over here (20ft away) and I can get all that for you. I asked for my keys back so I could get the info since I didn’t want to be stuck there and she said, “you need to make up you mind on getting the trade in value. I told you I wouldn’t until you test drive and picked a car, so you wanted to leave. Now you don’t want me to take your keys inside and get the appraisal done. Do you want a new car or not?” Confused on why she needed to bring keys inside to get info on a car, as well as, being irritated because I did exactly what Subaru asked (to see what Honda would give me so maybe they would be competitive) only to be given a runaround, I told her, thanks, but I will not be doing business with Subaru. Now, seeing that this facility has a history of making excuses for bad reviews, I’m sure they will blow this off and make it the customers fault again. No point in name dropping since it’s probably a training issue, rather than a personality issue. If they were not willing to keep their word in the beginning by doing their job getting information, I would not expect them to treat me right on the actual business end.I suggest anyone looking for information on trade in or new/used vehicles to go to Classic Honda of Midland where you are treated as a person, not a number.",1.0

7,"November 26, 2019","Staff was friendly and knowledgeable. One of the owners came out to meet us.
No pressure. Due your research before shopping. Regardless of what they tell you, they are making more on your purchase than disclosed. No business can operate at little to no profit.
Overall satisfied. Will update after having service.
Our sales person, Suhey Rodriguez, was great!

8,"July 02, 2019",Zack the finance manager is the most unprofessional and condescending person we’ve ever dealt with we purchased 2 vehicles through the dealership because of the warranty that they offer and have to jump through hoops to get all of our paperwork right. This is the only dealership where I’ve had to go to the bank after signing papers. Don’t recommend would never go back. Randy was the only one that was decent and we never worked with him.,1.0
9,"May 01, 2019","The staff will say or promise anything to get you in, but WILL NOT keep their word. Dont buy unless you get it in writting.  Managers will not deal with you, they jeeptge salespeople between you and them.",1.0
10,"April 29, 2019","I worked with my sales person Suhey which she was awesome and professional on helping me find the right vehicle for me (2017 WRX STI) We roughly spent 2 hours together then when we sat down to discuss numbers she introduced me to a sales manager/ Finance Manager by the name of “Santiago” and from the handshake the whole deal turned Sour... he shook my hand completely unprofessionally and the way he looked and spoke to me was as if he was looking down on me because of my younger age. He had a horrible attitude and quite frankly was disrespectful and believe racist. He then proceeded to say that he wasn’t negotiating nothing with me that “if I want to negotiate, go buy a new car” mind you I already had my pre-approval... all I needed was a reasonable negotiation but he didn’t want my business. On the way out the “Manager” didn’t bother to say anything just let me walk out or to even shake my hand. This was my second time going to this dealership but I’ll never go again. I wouldn’t recommend this dealership to nobody and the reason why dealerships have a bad reputation are because dealerships like this.... I actually took a 5 hour drive to Dallas and bought a brand new STI so I wouldn’t have to deal with this dealership. Negative 5 stars because of Santiago’s unprofessionalism. My Sales Person Suhey did awesome and it bums me out that she has a “Manager” like this throwing away her business. ",1.0
11,"March 27, 2019","I am now stuck paying close to 400 a month for a vehicle that 
1. Is not what I wanted.
2. I found out that while trying to trade I’m 5000 upside down on because they failed to tell me this vehicle had already been in a wreck!
3. I’m stuck with until I pay it off beacause being a single mother of three with 2 in college can’t afford a 6-7 k down payment. 
4. My insurance is just as much as my car payment because it’s been in an accident.
5 I have had to replace and fix tires all four tires with in a year of purchase which I can not afford! 

I will never ever deal with this dealership again in my life thank you basin Subaru for screwing a single mother and make her experience horrible now because I am worse off than I was when I came in to buy the car.


Do not buy a car from here!
