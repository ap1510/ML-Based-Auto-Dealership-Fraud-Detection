1,"November 30, 2017","Enjoyed working with Brazos Valley Imports on the purhase of our new vehicle. We had been looking for a new vehicle for several months at several different dealerships. We found this dealership to be friendly, very helpful in the selection and listened to our wants and needs in a new vehicle. We are very pleased with our new Santa Fe and have already recommended the dealership to family members. The staff was very friendly and very helpful. Thank you Brazos Valley Imports for a job well done.",5.0

6,"October 24, 2017",I had a 2017 Santa Fe Sport that was 1 year and 1 month old when the paint started peeling on one area. Hyundai approved the paint job and then it started peeling in another area. I only had 1500 more miles of warranty on my 2017. I told my salesman that I did not trust the 2017 car to not peel anywhere else and to get me in another vehicle. They worked hard and got me in another beautiful white Sport. They whole process was seamless and everyone was extremely nice. I could not have had a better experience - unless it was free!!!! Thank you Eric and Brazos Valley Imports.,5.0
7,"October 19, 2017","I hate looking for cars/being in car dealerships but honestly my experience with Hyundai was probably one of the best. The employees there made me feel more like a friend than a customer and even though the process took a few hours, it really felt like it went by quick. I walked into Hyundai not expecting to walk out of there with a car that quick so I was pleasantly surprised. I was also really happy that even though my car wasn’t ready for me, I was able to have a temp car of the same exact model.",5.0
8,"October 18, 2017",I made a couple visits to the dealership. Bought times we were greatest promptly.

9,"October 16, 2017","It was a great experience to buy my first new car, it was a nice offer for a Hyundai Tucson Eco 2017. I would like to have it in another color, instead of black, but still is a great car. Thank you",5.0
10,"October 08, 2017",Great service and hospitality. They were professional and it was a great experience. My only issue was that you should check the tires when a vehicle is purchased. I had to bring mine back a week and a half later because they all had low pressure. It was an easy fix but inconvenient considering I had just bought it.,4.6
11,"October 06, 2017",Everyone at Brazos Valley Imports was fantastic. I was given the opportunity to do several test drives and they found a way to provide me with great financing options for the vehicle I chose. I high recommend these guys for your next vehicle purchase.,5.0

24,"July 15, 2017","I cannot explain how impressed I am with this team time after time.  They have yet to let us down, which is why we our family is in our 5th Hyundai! Caton H. and Zach in financing once again did not disappoint when we purchased our new Santa Fe today.  This team is so professional and customer service oriented and went well above and beyond to get us into the vehicle we wanted with the payments we needed without all the ""fluff"".

47,"January 31, 2017","Eric Mikulenka is hand down one of the best car salesmen I have ever worked with.  He made what could be a long and arduous process, actually very pleasant.  He was attentive and listened to my needs to help find the perfect vehicle for my family.  To be honest, as a loyal Toyota customer, I never expected to find the kind of personal attention and professional service that I was accustomed to receiving.  However, Eric far exceeded my expectations.  Ultimately, he is a major reason we decided to purchase a Hyundai.  Don't get me wrong, I love my Santa Fe Sport!  But, I know that if I ever need anything, I can call Eric, and he will help me out.  Making the car buying experience fun, easy and personable - that is priceless.  Way to go, Eric!",5.0

70,"September 10, 2016","The overall experience in our purchase went really well. We knew the exact price going in-something we prefer- with there being a price incintive reduction. No pressure from anyone associated with Brazos Valley Imports. The total time spent  in closing the deal was a few hours longer than preferred but that did include the test drive, finance paperwork and an overview of the vehicle's features. We were disappointed that the navigation system SD card was missing. Someone removed it from the manual in the glovebox. After some back and forth dialog the salesman ordered one for us and is due to arrive next week. A follow up survey will follow.

OK, two weeks later and still no navigation SD card.  Jake our sales guy stated that he'd have to order one since cards are model specific. In other words they could not pull one from another vehicle on the lot (even though somebody removed the one in my Azera for what I wonder). He said he would order a new one which would take a week to arrive.  A week later it came in and I had to go to the dealership to pick it up. I got home and opened the package to find the card was for the Santa Fe. Remembering the cards are ""model specific""  I checked the Hyundai web site and found that yes they are but noted the cards for the 2015-2017 models are the same.  Wow, there was a 2016 Azera on the lot so why not give me that one and order another for it? I called the BV Hyundai parts and was on hold for a while before getting a response. Finally somebody picked up and after several minutes I was told not to insert the card because no one was sure it would work or mess up the system.  I didn't want to anyway because I got the feeling they'd void my warranty if it screwed up the navigation. The other part of this story- While on a lengthy hold for parts dept. I called my sales guy-who by the way gave me his cell number and insisted we call anytime with a problem. I explained my frustration and basically was given the rub off.  Yes, it was his day off but he said I could call ""anytime."" I actually felt this was a Hey, I sold the car and you are no longer my concern.  This concerns me enough about any service after the sale!  The good news is that Nathan in the parts dept. did work to appease me by ordering another SD card with a rush shipping request.  I think he actually went the extra mile to help.  In the mean time I'm still waiting  and the jury continues to be out on this situation.

71,"August 31, 2016","I have nothing but positive things to say about this dealership and the sales people.  We loved everything about our experience. When I drove off the lot in my 2017 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport, I could not stop smiling. I will do my darnedest to send more people to Brazos Valley Hyundai.",5.0

73,"July 23, 2016","I was first in contact with the online salesperson, Blake who was very helpful and answered all of my questions.  He then handed me over to Jake was very friendly and courteous and went out of his way to make us feel comfortable and answered all my questions.  He is an outstanding salesman.  Zach then closed the deal.  The only comment I would make is that it is a long waiting time between the decision to buy and getting to the financial person to close.  Other than that everything was wonderful and look forward to working with them again.",5.0
74,"July 14, 2016","Purchased a car for my daughter who will be attending Texas A&M.  We dealt with Eric who was nothing short of awesome!

77,"June 26, 2016","Great car, but very poor experience while purchasing.  Sales associate (Cheyenne) was friendly but kept putting the wrong info on paperwork while working on our agreement, which we constantly asked to have changed to the correct info.  Acted like he knew nothing about current Hyundai offers so I had to keep pulling their website up on my phone to show him what was listed.  Then tried to say that we could only have the rebate amount OR the financing offer, but I showed him again on their website that the offer was for both and stated rebate AND financing of 2.6%. Started to feel a little shady since it was the 2nd week of the month and we knew he was aware of the offers, just trying to get away with anything WE didn't know about.  Came to an agreement on trade in, price that was listed online (we did not ask for any other $ off because we believed it was fairly priced) and was approved for the 2.69% financing. Unfortunately, the credit application he gave me to sign, again, had incorrect information which I pointed out and corrected on the paper. I made the comment that I was concerned my purchase and financing paperwork would be incorrect because of how I kept getting papers with wrong info on them but was assured it would all be corrected.  Went to financing (Zach) and right away noticed that my email address was still incorrect and was listed as my husband even though I was the only buyer on this vehicle.  I marked through it and wrote my correct email address (one of several times) and was assured it would be entered correctly.  Zach spent a lot of time on the optional warranty information and talked with us about adding the breakdown warranty along with upgraded GPS, paint and interior, and ding protection. He talked about these options as if they were grouped together and when I asked how much this optional warranty package was, he quoted me $1495.  I would later the next day, while going over my paperwork (which we were quickly rushed through to sign since it was already after 8pm and he said he had 3 or 4 others to finish) realize that I was charged $1495 for the breakdown warranty, but almost another $1200 for the other 3 options, which were added to my vehicle purchase price.  We never agreed to these extras as individual options and were only told about the $1495 fee.  After reading the warranty info for those options and seeing that there were so many exclusions that I did not believe we would ever benefit from having them, I decided to go to the dealership and cancel those 3 options but leave the 10 yr/100,000 extended warranty since I was well within the 10 day deadline to do so.  The night before I went in, my husband received my Welcome to Hyundai Motor Finance email on his account, not mine....just as we expected.  The next day I went in to talk to Zach and told him about the email problem which he responded to by telling me he had already made the changes earlier that morning and that I should be getting them now.  When asked why he did not tell us about the extra fees for the other 3 warranties and why he said it was $1495 when we asked how much it would all cost, he said he did tell us those prices.  I reminded him of the exact conversation and then he changed his story to say that those warranties were part of the car deal and that we had agreed to those with Cheyenne our sales guy.  I told him we never discussed any warranties with Cheyenne, only him.  He then said that we had agreed to it when we agreed to a payment with Cheyenne.  I again informed him that we had never discussed any option charges or warranties with Cheyenne and we never came to an agreement on payments either.  We agreed to the purchase price, the trade in amount and the financing rate.  We did not know what those payments were going to be until we met with him.  I told him to cancel those extra warranties, which he did so by marking on the top of each to cancel and his initials.  I asked for copies of those cancellations and he said he could not give me anything because it would take about a week to get it processed (interesting, it only took a few hours to get it set up). I asked how I would know if everything was cancelled before the 10 day deadline and he assured me it would be but that he could give me a copy of the cancelled check given to financing, and I hope to pick that up this week.  Needless to say my husband and I both felt like we had been on the defensive throughout this process to keep from being scammed one way or another.   Last but not least, my emails never did start coming to me, only to my husband along with this one for the survey.  I called Zach and asked him why I still was not getting my emails (since I am the owner and purchaser of this car) and he said that it had gone through with the wrong information from the beginning when they submitted my credit application and that it was now impossible to change unless I did it myself.  I asked him why then did he tell me that Monday when I went in to cancel the warranties, that he had changed it that morning and that there would be no more problems and he could not answer that.  He basically said that Cheyenne and the sales manager messed it all up from the beginning and that he couldn't do anything about it.  Interesting how a finance manager cannot get the email address on the financing paperwork or purchasers account to be entered correctly so that the purchaser gets their emails from their finance company.  I asked then to speak with Cheyenne and I told him that I was very frustrated with this whole problem in getting my info correct and how we had voiced our concerns each and every time paperwork came to us with my husbands info instead of mine on it and we were assured it would be correct.  I told him that the survey he so desperatly asked us to give him a good score on was in my husbands inbox on his email account, not mine and until it did make it to my email account, that I would be unable to complete it for him.  He assured me that he would get the correct information added to my financing account as well as the general Hyundai emails that I should be receiving.  Sure enough, 2 days later I received my first and only email from Hyundai and it was this one, for the survey only.  Nothing at all was done with my financing account and I finally took care of that myself.  I cannot believe the incompetence of this dealership.  From the shady ways they tried to not give us the Hyundai offers that were current and listed on their webpage, to the outright lies that came from Zach about warranties and email addresses, I would never suggest a friend or relative do business with them. If they did, I would make sure they did their homework and knew everything there was to know about the current offers to make sure they got them as well as to read every single line of the papers before signing no matter how many people are in line and how late it is in the evening.  You have to be on your toes with these people at this dealership. Very disappointing too because we like to spend our money in our town and support our local businesses, but in this case we probably would have had a more professional expereince in Houston or Austin.",2.4
