6,"May 14, 2020","I loved my experience with Cook Ford! I completed my purchase from Louisiana and flew in to get the car that I wanted. I was skeptical of course but they helped me so much and made me feel so comfortable about it. They were not pushy about making a sale and truly had my best interest at heart!

9,"April 30, 2020","I bought my first vehicle last night with the help of my parents from Cook Ford! As a first time buyer, they made this process hassle free and enjoyable! They answered all of my questions and truly made myself and my parents feel like valued customers. Our salesman, Jody Dale, and their finance manager, Rick Gomez, even stayed well past closing to ensure I got this vehicle because of my dad’s work schedule. We were able to do the credit checks through an online form which made the process much faster once we arrived at the dealership. Through mine and my families dealings with Mr. Dale, he was extremely helpful and personable on the phone and in person. He never became pushy and made it very clear that if Cook Ford couldn’t give us their best deal, he did not expect us to buy the vehicle. Mr. Gomez was also wonderful! He again was never pushy! He informed us about different warranty packages, and we said we were not interested, he simply said “ok” and we moved on! He gave us great advice on how to improve my credit throughout this process as well. Traci Hendricks, their finance manager, who we had originally requested to deal with because of her wonderful reviews, came to us to personally to explain she was going to visit her grandchildren who she hasn’t seen in a while. She assured us we were in great hands with Mr. Gomez, game is her business card for any questions or concerns throughout the process, and truly made us feel like family. Everyone we dealt with at Cook Ford was wonderful! They made my first time buying experience go so smoothly and truly hassle free. Mr. Dale even went and filled up my 2017 Ford Explorer I purchased before we drove it off the lot! I would HIGHLY recommend Cook Ford in Texas City, TX to anyone looking to buy a new or used vehicle! They are truly amazing and made us feel like family. ❤️ ",5.0

12,"April 26, 2020","My boyfriend and I had a great experience with Louann! From the second we arrived she was honest and knowledgeable. She never pressured us to make a decision. Of all the places we went to, she was the most honest and respectful. Being younger, we felt like some other places did not take us seriously. She did from the second we arrived. She told us how it was and has the best personality. We loved working with her and love the truck we purchased. Only negative experience was with Traci in the Finance Department. We felt like she was rude and talked to us disrespectfully. Thank you Louann!",5.0

Service manager at Cook Ford told me there is a fix, but Ford would not pay for it. My vehicle has 37,000 miles. Cook Ford gave me options and they installed a PC222582Z kit. Performed a slight front end alignment and I can not be any happier with the results. The Service Manager was very professional and I feel very good about putting it on the road. Thanks Cook Ford!",5.0

35,"January 09, 2020",Place is a joke. Bought a new F-250 had a recall so they kept it and put me in a F-150. Also got scammed by the finance lady. Ordered weather tech mats and tint told it would be ready. Drove all the way back down there to get the truck and mats were not ready so had to drive all the way back down there the next day to get them on my dime. Would not recommend this place to my worst enemy. ,1.0

48,"September 20, 2018","Cook advertised a very specific price on a new Expedition which was highly competitive. Discounts were not detailed, only shown as 'Cook discounts'. At the dealership, the ""sale price"" given me was $5k OVER the internet price, because the ""Cook discounts' didn't apply to cash buyers. Fine. I understand you want to make money on financing. But be honest about the ""internet price"" you advertise. That was  a highly unethical and disingenuous (dishonest) tactic. Even if their price were better than another dealer, I would not go back and will never buy from them. Wasted my time.",1.4

50,"September 15, 2017","I purchased a new truck and the salesman was great. We agreed on a price and when I went to financing he added in a warranty that we never even discussed. He never gave me the buyers order either. After getting home and going over the paper work I called him and told him he overcharged me. He and the sales manager tried to explain what could have happened but never took responsibility for what  did happen. Never offered me anything for their deceiving act, just thanks for coming back in and see you later. I would proof everything you sign before you leave and ask for the financing paperwork and make sure it is correct. Great salesman, just shady financing people. ",1.8

56,"August 12, 2017","As a person who has purchased almost 20  from Cook(previously Gene Hamon) Ford since 1986, I have gone back time after time for two reasons, price and service. Also, I am not the easiest person to deal with when it comes to purchasing a new vehicle. The reason previous posters walk away disatisfied with Cook is because they are expecting big city ""fluff."" If you want hot dogs and balloons, go to to Houston. If you want the right car at a great price from a dealership who will do what they say, go to Cook Ford. Ask for Lisa R., and she will do everything to put you in a new Ford.",5.0

70,"June 21, 2017","Talk about delivering the way things used to be. I was an out of town visitor who realized at the last minute that I needed an oil change. I called the dealership and was told they could fit me in, but that I had to be there by 12:15p (it was a Sat.). I hustled down there and made it 12:15p on the dot. To my surprise they took the car in and changed the oil! Nowadays, most places would've passed the buck and told me that it was too late. However, not at Cook! 

Part of the reason why their treatment was truly appreciated was because this was the first time I had seen my sister in 22 years. And, I had my 16 year old son with me for the ride back home. So, again, thank you Cook for honoring your word. It made all the difference in the world. ",4.6

A very special shout out to Liz, Ryan, Anthony and Bryan who treated me with dignity and respect! I came into the dealership with some serious challenges but they were able to work things out for me.

77,"July 27, 2016","DO NOT purchase from Cook Ford!!! Before I purchased my car from Cook Ford I had read a ton of negative reviews. Typically I would have just kept on moving but that a specific model of Jeep for sale that I had been trying to find for quite some time so I rolled the dice and went to look at it. I explained my hesitance to the salesman and he assured me that the negative reviews were do to some old management and salespeople who were no longer there.

Again, i took a chance and took him at his word. I traded in my car and purchased the jeep that day. About 6 weeks later I received a letter from the finance company on my trade in, saying that the pay off was short. I contacted Cook Ford and let them know they agreed to pay off my car and that the finance company was saying they short paid. Brandie from Finance apologized and said they would get right on it. I again, took them for their word.

About 30 days later I received ANOTHER letter from the old finance company telling me I was now being reported to the credit bureau as being more than 60 days past due! I had never missed a payment or been late in my life and now because of Cook Ford I have a negative history mark on my credit report ( it dropped from a 750 to a 704 for this one thing! )

So i am now livid and I call Brandie. She is acting like it's my fault. So i did more digging, the payoff they got was good for the next 10 days. They sent the payoff in 20 days later after I traded the car in!!! So naturally, the payoff would be different. They also took their sweet time sending in the difference in payoff which resulted in my credit ding.

So I call the old finance company and present my case and they tell me it's ultimately my responsibility to pay any shortages and they will not report any changes to the credit bureau. So for the next 7 years, my perfect credit is dinged because of their incompetence, laziness, lack of customer service. 

RUN FROM THIS DEALERSHIP!!!",1.4
78,"May 20, 2016","Lisa Requenes was my sales person and she was very professional, honest and her communication skills were as good as I have ever had.  She answered ever question I had if it meant going to another resource.  Every issue I had with the car she was able to resolve it with me to my satisfaction.

I maybe spent 15 minutes at the dealership negotiating the deal and that was it.  I live on the north side of Houston and Lisa drove the new car up to me and picked up our trade.

82,"February 13, 2016","Took my 2009 Ford F-150 to have the oil changed, which I've only had done at Cook Ford.  Arrived at 10:15am and was told it would be ready in approximately 45 minutes, since they were busy.  After over an hour of waiting my truck had not moved.  Asked why and was told they were busy but not sure whatvthe exact hold-up was.  Another customer came in and was turned away because the technicians leave at noon.  Asked how my truck would get processed within 30 minutes and they didn't have an answer.  I was waiting in the dealership waiting room and never given an update during my wait.

84,"December 14, 2015","What kind of ""dealer"" sells cars with the wrong tires on it? The kicker is they know it has the wrong tires on the vehicle, yet still try to sell it, and don't advertise this defect online. Then when I asked for safe proper tires that don't effect the drive of the vehicle, they said I had to pay for them. This is a way to have lower prices online and raise the price at the sales table. I was very shocked at this tactic, it looked like a small town type dealer and I expected more. Guess I was wrong. I was also told to swallow my pride and purchase another vehicle that I was not interested in. Very rude and unprofessional.",1.0

My salesperson (Lisa) was super easy to talk to and didn't bug the crap out of me while I was trying to look at different vehicles.

I arrived at Cook Ford to sit down with my sales representative Rosalinda. She was able to locate the 2015 F250 I have been searching for. After taking my information on my trade and such she left to go run the numbers. This is when all goes south! The sales manager comes back not Rosalind, and states you want what for your trade, thats retail. I politely stated no sir I looked it up before hand. He looked up a 2014 v6 Ram 1500 slt. When infact my vehicle is a 2014 ram 1500 LoneStar package with 8.4 navigation, 20inch wheels ect. Before hearing all that my truck included he walks away. When he returns slapping the paperwork on the desk and states I tell you what I will give you 29k for your but your going to pay full MSRP FOR MINE! At that point I thanked him for his time and stood up to leave, he continued to tell me my truck wasn't worth it and why should he deal with me. I again asked him to stop speaking to me in which he replied I can say whatever I want to who I want. Well sir not to me. If you couldn't get the numbers correct for a deal a simple Mr Jones Im sorry we cant get where you need to be. Not speak as if he is the only for dealer in the state of Texas. Mr Cook I sincerely hope that your dealership sell so many vehicles that you do not need any new business from my family friends and coworker.

87,"April 28, 2014","I have to admit I was dreading the process of purchasing a new vehicle.  However, Cook Ford's price on a new Ford F-150 was good enough for me to travel almost 500 miles to purchase this vehicle.  No one in West Texas could even get close in price.  When I arrived, everything on the vehicle was exactly as described by salesman Johnny Strong.  The buying experience was great.  This is a family owned dealership with a sale's staff that seems to care about their customers.  If you are looking for a dealership that can out compete big dealership prices, no pressure sales staff, and friendly service, this is the place to go.  Cook Ford will be first on my list the next time I purchase a new or used Ford vehicle.  I want to thank salesman Johnny Strong, manager Cody Colvin, and the finance staff for their professionalism and for making our buying experience a great one!",5.0
88,"December 31, 2013","Our vehicle was involved in an accident on Dec 21 of 2013. We had the car towed to Cook Ford for evaluation of damages, and while there my wife and I met Sherry at the body shop. Hearing our concerns and sympathizing with us she recommended that we speak with Steve Rutherford if we ended up needing to purchase a new vehicle. After worrying through the Christmas holidays the insurance adjuster finally contacted us on Dec 27 and informed us that our car would be totaled. My wife called and spoke with Mr. Rutherford about looking at decent used vehicles thinking that we wouldn't be able to afford a new one. We went to Cook Ford on Dec 30 to remove what belongings that remained in our Ford Focus and to meet Mr. Rutherford and possibly browse the used inventory, if he could work us into his schedule. Not only did he work us into his schedule, but he and Shawn (who's last name I cant remember) were able to put us into a brand new Ford Fusion with monthly payments we can afford. Overall the experience we had, with the total loss of our vehicle and worrying about what we were going to do, I'm glad that Cook Ford was there to help get us through a tough time. ",5.0
89,"November 15, 2013","As a family out of town and in a bit of a 'pinch' due to the poor service of another automotive business, the help and customer service we found at Cook Ford were exactly what we needed. My husband priced the truck he wanted, had loan approval worked out and etc the day he first test drove the truck. The next day we went to finalize paperwork and etc and it was a completely hassle free, quick, but well explained process. We received the best customer service we've ran into in this area of Texas and were thankful for it. Rosalinda and Cody were friendly and personable. Often times at dealerships there is a little badgering but NONE of that here. I would recommend doing business here to anyone. ",4.8

96,"June 14, 2011","GREAT PLACE TO GO PLEASE READ!!!

I bought my truck August 31, 2010 and by December had a few problems go wrong with it...the main problem being that it developed a tick and a misfire. I wanted to wait to see if any other problems came up so i decided to wait before i took it in(also broke :/ ). So I waited till i could take it in this June, well i paid 2000 for a warranty and it didn't want to cover anything...All ill say was Mr. Cook made everything RIGHT! My truck got repaired and i am very happy with the service i received! I would highly recommend this dealer to anyone! I am now a lifetime custom of theirs!

THANKS KEDGE!!!
