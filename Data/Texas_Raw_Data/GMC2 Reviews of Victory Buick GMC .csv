1,"November 21, 2011","We bought a car had 1 hour and oild poored from engine. We took it back and Roy Gladden was very reluctant to fix the problem stating vehcile was ""ASIS"". He then sold us a KIA Surento that my wife drove for 1 month when it threw the timing belt causing major damage to the engine. We later found out that he had lied to us stating there had never been any problems with the engine. He later admitted the vehcile had timing belt issues in the past. When I called him abvut the problem he yelled stating my wife damaged the engine, which my mechanic laughed at, he refused to make the give us our down payment back stating it was ""ASIS"" we let him take it back and he has sold it to some other sucker. We have talked to several of Gladden's old customers who stated they all had simmular problems and some found Roy had made temporray repairs using liquid glass in the engine to get vehicle running just long enough to get it off his lot and when vehcile broke down he refused to give money back. PLEASE TAKE MY ADVICE ROY GLADDEN IN NOTHING BUT A CROOK AND YOU BUY ANYTHING FROM HIM YOU WILL BE SORRY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1.8
