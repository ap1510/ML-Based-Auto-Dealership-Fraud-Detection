18,"August 19, 2015","Called the day before, was told no appointment necessary. Bring car in at whatever time and it will be ready in an hour. Took car in for oil change and 10,000 mile inspection next day (my day off). Was advised that car would not be ready in an hour but would be ready by 6 because they close at 7. They never called. When I called around 6:30 I was advised vehicle would not be ready till sometime tomorrow and everybody was ""gone"". I was left without a vehicle, no way to take kids to school or get to work. They should have called and let me know car would not be ready before they all left at 5 so I could either pick it up or make arrangent for transportation to school and work. Nobody would talk to me. They even said there was no managers or supervisors and wouldn't even give me a name of who I could speak with tomorrow. I will take my business back to SA or Corpus Christi where staff is reliable and accessible and comunication is not an issue. ",1.0

21,"January 24, 2012","This has got to be the worst dealer (Payne mission) i have ever been to. Was looking to purchase a pre owned 2011 volkswagen CC after seeing one in the dealer i decided to purchase it having them run my credit and approve everything. After everything was done and i was 3/4 signing the contracts they salesperson came in and told me that we couldn't do the deal because the car was sold. After complaining a while i talked to the manager Rene something and OMG this guy is even worse than i could imagine hes like i cant do anything i can ive you a new one at invoice but that's it, you know i cant turn back time. Well his invoice price was 3000 dlls more than what you can get on autotrader also new. 0 customer service, management doesn't care at all about service or at least being nice to the customers, will never set foot on that dealership. 1 day later got a great deal from barrett on a used mercedes. Thanks for nothing Payne.",1.4
22,"July 18, 2011","Second bad experience with this dealership. I bought the vehicle here 5 years ago. 
The first oil change took over 5 hours despite appointment. Never went back after this horror until today. I bought a 15$ air filter with my credit card and was treated like a criminal...had to dig my ID out of my bag and when I was aked why the employee told me they need to make sure the card is not stolen in front of several othe customers. NEVER AGAIN. I would rather walk then buy anything from Payne again.",1.4
