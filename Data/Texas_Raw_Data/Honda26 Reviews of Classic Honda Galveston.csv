0,"November 05, 2019","Spent the morning cleaning and shining my car, inside and out then brought it in for an oil change that was supposed to be complimentary with the purchase of the car. Not only was I asked two different times to pay two different amounts, but they brought the car back dripping wet from a drive thru car wash that I did not ask for and was not made aware of.  But worse was the oil in the seat, on the steering wheel, two places on the door and the entire driver side floor mat and surrounding floor board.  This is the third negative experience my family has had with Classic Auto Group Galveston. They are terrible!",1.0

4,"May 19, 2018","After telling Erik Munoz what I was looking for, and how far I was driving, he had the car ready and all paperwork so when I got there I didn't have to wait.  He let me drop my 4 yr old off with his grandmother during the test drive (about 20 minutes away) and after sitting down with Erik, it took less than 5 minutes to reach a deal.  We were happy on our trade offer as well as our CPO car price.  Finance was very friendly and not pushy and then they walked us through all the car features.  It's been 2 weeks and I'm very happy with our purchase.  Thanks again Erik and Honda of Classic Galveston.",5.0
5,"April 01, 2018","only if you have excellent credit go to this dealer, I went and my credit was 699 and nothing to help you, they want to sell you another car, then they tell you that it is very expensive to interest you to be your first car, and so they want sell, they are very strict and do not help you, but you have excellent credit or fences",2.0

7,"September 29, 2017","I've bought many new vehicles in my life....but for the very first time ever...Classic Honda and my sales agent, Bridget, made it a hassle free, wonderful experience.  I will never go anywhere else to purchase an auto!  I highly recommend anyone to go visit Bridget if you are in the market for a car! She's located in the Honda Dealership..but she can sell any of the Makes and Models that they offer..Honda, Toyota, Buick ,Ford, Chevy, Cadillac, and GMC.  YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED! Even their finance dept is smooth and hassle free! You can request Brett, who was equally pleasant, if he's not busy with another customer! THANK YOU FOR MY FIRST ""HASSLE FREE"" EXPERIENCE WHEN BUYING A CAR! Y'all are THE BEST!!!!!",5.0
8,"June 07, 2012","Best and most painless car buying experience I have ever had. Salesman knew what I wanted and between himself and the manager they made it happen in very little time. No haggling, just awesome customer service, and was even greeted with a handshake from the owner. Not to mention after coming home with the car I received a thank you gift of cookies and a card. I would recommend this dealer to everyone in the Clear Lake area. I have been a loyal Honda customer since 2001 and I wouldn't go anywhere else but Classic Honda in Galveston in the future.",5.0
9,"March 21, 2012","I traded my 2008 Corvette for a Honda Pilot (I never thought I'd make the trade).  After looking at the vehicle with Justin and Eli and talking in length about the attributes this vehicle would bring to me and my family situation, I decided to see what my vette would bring.  I was extremely happy with the way everything was handled and the professionlism that both Justin and Eli showed.  Once the price was negotiated, Eli took over with what I thought would be a dreadfully long process, not so.  Eli was prepared for the transaction and was most helpful in leading me into the best interest rate he could find for me.  The entire ordeal was painless.  Afterwards, Eli turned me back over to Justin.  Justin spent the remainder of time with me going over all the features that my new Pilot Touring offered.  I can't compliment the two of them enough.  They are indeed an asset to Classic.  I've sent many of my family and friends to Justin to buy new vehicles, and they have!  Justin has an obvious love of cars and knows the facts for each vehicle.  You just trust the guy!  Great experience.",5.0
10,"March 20, 2012","I was referred to Classic Honda by Jerry Reynolds,&quot;The Car Pro&quot;, because of an ususual sitaution I found myself in. I had purchased from another dealer back in January of this year and had &quot;settled&quot; for a car that I really didn't want.  Mr. Reynolds told me that Howie Bently, the owner at Classic Honda, would probably be able to work with me, if anyone could, to get me into the car I wanted at an acceptable price. 

I contacted Mr. Bently via email and heard back from him the same evening. The next day, his Sales Manager, Mr. Ever Piera, contacted me and told me of some options I had, and invited me to come down to Galveston and I made an appointment with him for the next day. 

Upon arriving, Ever was busy with a customer, but I started working with Justin, one of his salesmen, on looking at what I wanted to get.  I found the exact car I wanted!  Ever then took over and worked, in my opinion, a miracle with discounts, dealer incentives, etc to get me into the same car, for LESS MONEY than what I had paid for the first one! Then Debbie, the finance manager took over and did some shopping around for financing.  I had set a monthly limit for myself of not over $500 a month for a car note.  The financing came in at $498.xx.  

When I first arrived at Classic, it was Saturday night at 5pm, so they weren't able to finish the financing for me, and I had to return today (Tuesday).  The really unexpected thing they offered me was to go ahead and take the car!!  A really nice, unexpected touch!

The atmosphere at Classic is one of the things I liked the best.  I get kind of frustrated in dealing with most dealerships where most of the men and women are all &quot;stuffy&quot;, the guys in business suits and women in formal work dresses or pants suits. Even Mr. Bently, the owner, came out to meet me and he was dressed in a polo short, jeans and tennis shoes. Ever, the sales manager, and Justin were dressed similarly.  It just makes people feel more at ease, like you're dealing with &quot;real people.&quot;  

I can't think of any of my friends right now that are in the market for a new car, but if/when I do, I'll DEFINITLY reccomend Classic Honda of Galveston to them.  It's nto the most convenient to me, as I live in Houston and Galveston is about 1.5 hours away, but WELL worth the drive!!",5.0
11,"March 11, 2012","This was the best car buying experience I have had. They were extremely nice and knowledgeable about the cars. Classic Dealership in Galveston has a number of dealerships under the Classic name. Even though my car preference was Honda, my salesman Justin took me down to the Toyota Dealership and we test drove a Toyota as well. My original preference was Honda however the Toyota worked better for me. Justin worked in conjuction with Lisa Requenes and Sabrina Stokley of Classic Toyota to make it happen. Everyone went out of their way to work with me to get the car I wanted. ",5.0
12,"December 28, 2011",This is my second lease from Sand Dollar Honda. I cannot espress enough how wonderful they treat their customers. Their over-the-top customer service and honesty is beyond words. A once dreaded necessity has become a pleasurable experience I look forward to. ,4.8
13,"July 27, 2011","I was looking for a dealer to buy a new Fit at. There were several around the Houston area who had or claimed to have them in stock. While Sand Dollar didn't have a lot of comments, they all seemed pretty genuine and positive about their experience. I don't really like the whole haggling process for cars, but don't want to feel like I'm getting ripped off either. Their website indicated that they use no-haggle pricing with a decent (for Honda) discount on everything. Anyway, they were very friendly, were knowledgeable about the car, and there was no pressure. While they offered things like extended warranties, and encouraged you to use their service (by having the service manager introduce himself), there was no pressure to jack up the prices with extra add-ons. When I said no, they didn't try to talk me into it, or slip it into the order. They offered a fair, if not extraordinary, price for my trade-in, and were willing to negotiate a bit. Financing was straightforward, and, when they found we had good credit, didn't try to get us to spend more money. Overall, I left feeling happy with my car, and like I paid a fair price. That's how I like my car buying experience. Even though it's not the closest dealer, I will be going back for my next car.",4.8
14,"July 14, 2011",I came in today for a service to my mothers vechile and Chuck was by farmost the best service advisor we have ever had.We came in today for a simple oil change. Chuck got us in and out with ease. He suggested a larger service and didn't pressure me to get it done today. I find this place more trustworthy than other places I have been to. ,5.0
15,"May 31, 2011","Great Experience.  Edgar is honest and the fleet manager is, too.  I drove past Honda of Clear Lake to get to Sand Dollar.  Good pricing.  I've owned 3 Hondas: first was purchased from Clear Lake, second from Russell and Smith.  I highly recommend Sand Dollar.  Russell and Smith is good, too, but didn't have the specific car I was looking for this time.  For the love of God, stay away from Honda of Clear Lake.   ",5.0
16,"October 06, 2010","This was the best car buying experience ever. I went in with my dad to help him purchase a new CR-V. I had gotten quotes from dealers all over town, and they had been full of bogus fees and other things to inflate their profit. The Guys at Sand Dollar do not play games and try to add things to make more money. From Looking to Financing it was all done in less than 2 hours, and we were out the door with the new CR-V. Even My dad commented, that he was expecting hours of negotiations and hassles, none of which we got. I am thoroughly impressed with everything, and we will recommend Sand Dollar Honda to anyone who asks. ",5.0
17,"June 25, 2010","Lenora was a great sales rep. She knew our situation and did everything in her power to help us. She was very consistent and always called to give us updates on what was being done so we wouldnt lose hope. i was impressed with the interest rate we were able to recieve as well as the price of notes we were able to get as well. thank you Lenora, keep up the awesome work. We will be sending more people your way ",5.0
18,"May 14, 2010","I had such a great experience at Sand Dollar Honda - - from the test drive to the paperwork everything went so smooth!   I went in thinking maybe a Honda Accord 4 door - or possibly a CRV, but the second I saw the Honda Accord 2 door I knew I was in love!!  Just to be sure ... Bob had me test drive all cars to to ensure this was the one for me and once I had confirmed my choice and was indeed in love with the 2 door coupe - we identified color and accessories!  Since I live in Louisiana most of the sale had to be coordinated long distance.   Ever put my car on hold for me (even though I would not be back to buy it for (2) weeks!!), Eli took credit application and got that process started and when I showed up to buy my car Edgar baby-sat me through the whole process!! John in Finance helped arrange great interest rate with Honda and after several weeks I am more thrilled than ever with my new car!!!   
I have a very nice, very beautiful, very smooth riding new car that I bought from Sand Dollar Honda in Galveston, TX, but I could not have asked for a sweeter, more wonderful group of guys to make my experience go so well!!   I am grateful to the Team and would  buy another car from these guys in a heartbeat!!!       ",5.0
19,"May 07, 2010","We went to Sand Dollar Honda to just look and see what was out there.  When we first arrived, Ever (the GM) greeted us and then walked us over to Edgar to get started.  Edgar was great.  I'm very indecisive and have to look at a little bit of everything before I'm ready to make a decision.  He extrememly patient with me and let me take my time looking and test driving.  By the time I was ready, it was past their usual closing time.  They never rushed us once and we the most friendly salesmen I had ever worked with.  I would recommend them to everyone I know.",5.0
20,"April 13, 2010","We have bought several cars from Ever at Sand Dollar Honda. He is professional, friendly and doesn't give you the typical sales pitch. He works with you and gets you what you want even if it isnt in their inventory. I recommend sand dollar and ever to all my friends and family!",5.0
21,"April 12, 2010",Out salesperson was Leonor Trevino. I have given her this raiting because she was really helpful and assisted us with great service and was patient. She assistance was also appreciated when ordering another car for us. she made sure everything was going right. I would highly recommend her to anybody looking for a car.,5.0
22,"March 22, 2010","My husband and I were greeted at the dealership's parking lot making us at ease. They were very accomodating rather than aggressive with making a sale, which helped us when we made our decision. All our questions were answered efficiently proving they knew their product well. They were very meticulous in orientation of both vehicles we tried. All in all, their customer service helped us find our perfect vehicle...Thanks :)",5.0
23,"March 15, 2010",the experience of buying a car was good. they were friendly.i went in and i was greeted right away. gerald looked in the parking lot to see  how he had for me and he showed me 2 choices. i picked the white one because i have a background of nursing so i guess that is why i chose white.,5.0
24,"October 04, 2009","Received prompt, excellent service.  No hard sell; rather friendly, informative, helpful, straight forward service, and a great deal.  The Dealership also helped me get a better financing deal than I was able to find elswhere.  As a returning customer, I can say that it is likely that I will return again, when the time is right.",5.0
25,"August 24, 2009","We visited Sand Dollar Honda to take advantage of the cash-for-clunkers program.  It was the last weekend of the program, and many dealers had already shut it down, but Sand Dollar was still honoring it.  After a terrible experience up the road at Clear Lake Honda, I called Sand Dollar, spoke to Toby Green, and was actually able to agree upon a price over the phone.  When we arrived and reviewed the contract, it was exactly as we discussed, with no tricky fees added.  This was one of the easiest car buying experiences I've ever had.  I was impressed enough with Sand Dollar to log this entry at Dealer Review (and mad enough about the Clear Lake Honda experience to log my experience with them as well.)  I'd definitely recommend Sand Dollar Honda.",4.8
