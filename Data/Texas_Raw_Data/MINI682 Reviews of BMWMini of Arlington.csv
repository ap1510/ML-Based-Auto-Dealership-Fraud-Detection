0,"March 31, 2020","I initially purchased an X5 SUV and realized the very next day the vehicle did not have the comfort access feature I was expecting. I thought I would be satisfied with what I purchased but after a week, I simply wasn't happy. I returned the vehicle expecting to receive the same value as purchased so that I could purchased an X5 SUV with comfort access feature. I became dissatisfied when the salesperson would not give me the same return value as original purchase. When I asked to speak with the General Manager, I was informed he was not in the office. Shortly after leaving him a voice message, I received a callback from him only to find out he was out of the country. Given that he was out of the country, he assured me he would try and make contact. Ultimately I purchased a BMW to my satisfaction all because the General Manager, Michael Coleman heard my concerns and made sure I was taken care of. I truly appreciate the General Manager, Michael Coleman taking the time to resolve my concerns while he was out of the country.",4.6
1,"January 04, 2020","Went in for an oil change. my car told me it was 1/2 full of oil. when my car was returned to me after service, it was still sitting on 1/2 full of oil. Huh? i asked Corey Hill  about the infraction and he asked me what I wanted him to do about it and i told him to make it right. then since i had to tell Corey what to do, i went to Antares the service manager and he told me that they only put what BMW recommends. ive had my oil changed a many of times and never got it back at the 1/2 full mark. the Antares guy was arrogant and didn't want to admit to their technicans making a cursory decision not to conpletely fill my oil reservoir. i will never go back to this horrid establishment nor will i send any of my family members for their service either.",1.0
2,"November 14, 2019","I was an out of state buyer and had been in touch with 2 people (nia and justin) from the dealership through emails and text messages. They ran my credit application and i was approved with a high apr but nonetheless approved and i told them i wanted to proceed with the application. They sent me a credit card authorization form to put the deposit on. As i filling the form out, i was told that the car is no longer on the market. Not only this isnt ethical and just wrong, i received way too many hard inquiries on my credit and my score went down by 30 points immediately, just killing all my chances of buying another car in a different dealer. Worst sales people ever! He didnt even reply. I received a call hours later, and was told to look for another car they have on their website or just walk away. Do not work with them! Stay away! ",1.0
3,"November 01, 2019","I am absolutely disappointed with this dealership. I am disappointed with Mercer, Nia and Terry. The deal was a solid one; however, the fact that no one returned a phone call or stated what was needed is beyond me. To make matters worse, I had to follow up to make sure they were working on my deal. Mercer thought Nia was working on it and Nia assumed Mercer was working on it - needless to say, the car was sold but I was first in line to buy it. I wouldn't recommend Mini of Arlington to anyone in my sphere of influence. Jessica H. ",1.0
4,"October 12, 2019","I am an owner of 750li. I have been a customer of BMW Arlington for several years. Unfortunately after they decided to implement an oil leak issue, based on BMW settlement for my engine, they turned my car into a death trap. After they made changes to my engine I have been back to their shop at least five times. My car which was one of the most beautiful and powerful machines I have ever owned, started stopping in the middle of the highway causing a major threat to my safety. It caused a huge disruption to my family life, and turned a 6 figure investment into a nightmare. Although they told me my car engine now under a 2 year warranty, every time I take it back, after a horrible engine episode, they claim it is not related to the oil leak issue and have the audacity to ask me for more money. I have put up with the rudeness of some of their staff, and  the unwelcoming posture in hope they do the right thing especially for a customer who spends a large amount of money in their shop, but I am getting to the end of my robe, and thinking not only staying away from their shop, but BMW all together",1.0
5,"August 24, 2019","Thanks to the staff of BMW/Mini of Arlington.  Worth the drive from McKinney!  After a number of dealers that had me shopping online, I found Chelsea and she and the manager made sure we had THE dream
car we wanted, at the payment we could afford.  In fact, after we agreed to a number, they went back and fought for better financing and that dropped our APR and monthly payment to the exact number we'd humbly requested (just refinanced our house and our credit had taken temporary hit.)

Plus, the manager scored a ride for Juniper.  She's still dancing.

Seriously, I detest the dealership experience.  BMW/Mini of Arlington changed all of that.  Have you ever agreed to numbers and had the staff come back with BETTER numbers?  This does not happen.

I give them 5 stars for every part of the experience.  Family plans a new purchase in months or so and there's only one place we'll shop.

Kudos, BMW/Mini of Arlington.  You have raised the bar for sales and service.",5.0
6,"June 13, 2019","It is not that we may fall down in life, but the positive way we stand back up.  I brought my 2003 Mini Cooper to BMW Mini of Arlington and got engine repairs performed.  The repairs did not correct the issues with my engine.  I emailed the General Manager Michael Coleman a letter late Sunday evening 6-9-2019.  Mr. Coleman called and left a voicemail Monday 6-10-2019 prior to noon.  I got the message too late to return the call. He then called Tuesday 6-11-2019 morning and we spoke about my request for resolution.  Michael Coleman advised he would have the Manager of the Service Department Dustin Moore call to discuss the mechanical and diagnostics.  I must admit that the condition of my breaks prevented a complete test drive to assist with the technical diagnostic process. Dustin Moore called 15 minutes later and agreed to my request for resolution immediately.  

The management at BMW Mini of Arlington, handled my request for resolution in a speedy, respectful, compassionate and professional manner. ",4.4

10,"February 01, 2018","I took my Mini in for the first service the morning of January 26, 2018. It was returned to me the evening of January 31. 
On the afternoon of the 26th my vehicle was backed out of the shop by a MINI technician into another customer’s car. I did not see the damage. The rear bumper was sanded, primed and painted. 
I was generally displeased when learning of the incident. I was told people are human and make mistakes from time to time. 
I still believe more care could have been exercised in moving my car out of the service bay. ",2.0

13,"December 31, 2017",This was my first experience with a BMW / MINI dealership and I wasn’t sure what to expect.  I was very pleased with the experience!  I didn’t feel pressured at all.  Pedro Alicea was very knowledgeable about the options and each vehicle I was interested in on the lot.  He was very patient about answering all my questions - and offered a lot of information I didn’t think to ask about.  I definitely felt like a valuable customer!,5.0
14,"December 28, 2017","Worked with Pedro to buy my MINI countryman.  Pedro was awesome to work with, very helpful, patient and professional.  I had not initially planned to purchase from this dealership based on previous interactions.  Working with Pedro and learning that the dealership was now under new ownership swayed me to have an open mind.  I’m glad I did.  Experience was very positive start to finish and with every member of staff.  If you are in the market for a MINI, give this dealership a shot.  You will be treated with respect and no pressure.  I really have appreciated the service and responsiveness after the sale as well.  Some dealers say they want to build relationship but I truly believe these folks mean it.",5.0
15,"December 28, 2017","Dealership had a good selection of preowned Mini Countrymen, which was the car I was interested in test driving. Cody Cox was personable but not high pressure. He has also contacted me making sure things are fine after the point of purchase. He even put my license plates on for me. ",4.8
16,"December 22, 2017","This service department is not to be trusted. I took my car in for an inspection sticker, they informed me that my warranty had ended 2 weeks prior. When I left with my inspection sticker, w days later my check engine light came on. Because of the code the fix would cost 1,100. When I picked my car up, the check engine light came on again. They said it was a different code and that was $800. Picked up the car and a week later the check engine light came on again. 1,400.  From October til December my car has been in the shop 4 times. And each time my car was held for 1-2 weeks. Each time they said it was a different code, but before my warranty I only had to take my car in for oil, inspection and tires.  DO NOT TAKE YOUR CAR TO THESE PEOPLE! DO NOT TRUST THEM!  Even the manger was not helpful.",1.0

19,"November 04, 2017","I spoke with Cat one day after work when I was getting my MINI looked at in service. We started talking about the cars and she showed me things on my car I’ve had for three years and never knew about!
Even my previous salesman didn’t show me these things. I didn’t know the HD radio was off, I didn’t know about the lane change blinker.. or this really cool secret dash compartment. I’m speechless. I’m so glad I met this girl, and she sales the MINIs!",5.0
20,"November 03, 2017","I recommend you stay away from this dealership. They have a F better business bureau rating, and my experience with them is consistent with that rating! 

Their service department while doing a warranty repair cross-threaded and ruined a $1,600 catalytic converter while inserting the oxygen sensor. My BMW Denver dealership's service department spent two weeks trying to get a response from them about their mistake and finally I had to track down the general manager to get any movement on the issue...only to have this Arlington dealership refused to take any responsibility for it, stating they have no responsibility since the car changed ownership since the botched repair was performed. 

I believe a repair shop should stand behind its work, especially when they make an egregious error in their workmanship! This is not becoming of a BMW dealership in my opinion!!! ",1.3
21,"November 02, 2017","In search of my first new MINI, it can be scary. But Catherine changed all that. Being very knowledgeable with MINI, she makes the buying experience smooth. I get to keep my current MINI. It's just a great feeling. Thank you!",4.8
22,"October 26, 2017","This was my first visit to BMW OF Arlington,for scheduled service on my 2015 X5 Diesel. I left with a big grin on my face.  Service consultant Joshua Boller, explained,in detail,the BMW service plan on my Vehicle. I was impressed with the professionalism and honesty exhibited by Mr Boller.  In my opinion,he is an asset to this business. 

I waited about an hour for the service to be completed. While waiting, you're surrounded by friendly people who work hard at treating you special. Makes you want to came back for more. That's exactly what I intend to do.

If you own a BMW, I highly recommend this dealer for service.

24,"October 14, 2017","Cat at MINI of Aington was the consummate professional when buying my MINI Cooper S Countryman ALL4.  As a first time MINI buyer, her passion for the car line was exciting.  The test drive was a blast, and I had more fun buying a car from her than I have at other dealerships.  I was in and out in less than 4 hours which was another plus.

29,"September 13, 2017","Arrived at the Mini Dealership was welcomed by David whom was very friendly. He was glad to let me test drive the 2017 Mini Crossroads, this car is awesome, the feeling of driving a small sports car was fun in the city. I almost did not want to drive it back to the dealer. I asked about special financing as having bad credit. This was no problem and financing was available for people with lower than average credit scores. The important part was scheduled maintenance financed into the loan, with oil changes. 
The lease option did not appeal to me as I like own. I hope other people have a positive experience with this dealership, and I highly recommend you do your homework first and be ready to bring income statements and your bills so they can calculate the best deals for you. Even though I did not drive my Mini home today. I highly recommend this dealership being professional and courteous going above and beyond what other dealers have. 
Also; Be ready to bring some cash to the table, but under $9,999 and have a letter from your credit union like me, this way you are guaranteed the best financing options and get the most out of your purchase, Keep it real and know exactly what you are getting before you sign.  
Thank you David Decker & Catherine Adams.

31,"August 28, 2017","Without a doubt, I am the happiest girl in the world thanks to BMW of Arlington!! I am especially grateful for Stan Kappus, Michael Coleman, Brendon Porter and Robb Leyda. This incredible group of men made my dream of owning a BMW a reality. ""Thank you"" seems inadequate for all they did for me. 
I worked long distance with Stan, and because of the trust built in our interactions, I drove over 1,000 miles to purchase my manual 128i convertible. Hands down, best decision ever! 
I had a 16 hour drive back to Indiana, and Stan checked in with me periodically to ensure I was getting home safe. I am truly blown away by the kindness I have been shown. Regardless of where I live in the future, I will always come back to BMW of Arlington to purchase my BMW's. 
Mr. Coleman's dealership truly embodies the spirit of BMW. This was an experience I will NEVER forget. From the bottom of my heart- thank you!",5.0

She worked through my vehicle purchase on my terms, listened to my asks, and delivered exactly what I was looking for in a new MINI.

34,"July 25, 2017","I cannot say enough about what a well organized program Michael Coleman (GM) is running. As a business leader myself we strive to perfect our process by recognizing who our customers are and providing the absolute best service experience we can possibly offer. Michael and his staff clearly operate in this fashion. I had the pleasure of working with Sam Kim a Sales Manager, Robb Leyda the Dir of Finance, and Alan Gonzalez the sales representative. All of these professionals advocated for me as if they were purchasing for themselves. They anticipated and covered my needs better than I could've done myself. It was clear they are masterfully trained to recognize they are the ones we (the customer) rely upon to ensure a seamless and painless transaction. Because I live in another state, each of them made themselves available during and after work hours (as if they never stop working) and while the truck was being delivered they constantly checked in with me and with the delivery company to ensure an accurate timeframe for delivery and to make sure I was happy with my purchase (I'm thrilled with my purchase!!). I will purchase from these guys again. Thank you for making this as easy a car buying (and delivery) experience I have ever had!

35,"July 17, 2017",Just purchased a  2014 BMW X1 from BMW of Arlington and my wife and I were very impressed with everyone at the dealership. We were in a bad financial situation and didn't think we could get into another car. But then we talked to Thomas Hayden and he went above & beyond anything we expected. He introduced us to Benjamin Song who helped us find the perfect car. Then Thomas put us in touch with Robb Leyda the financial Wizard and the next thing I know we're the proud owners of a beautiful black BMW X1...we highly recommend Thomas Hayden and all of the guys at BMW of Arlington! 5 Star service all the way!!!,5.0

37,"June 11, 2017",Benjamin Song has gone far beyond the role of a salesman to help me. I'm a first time car buyer and he walked me through every single step and explained every single detail (no matter how many times we had to go over some items again). But he didn't not stop or even rest till he found be the best car for me and what will not only be helpful in my daily commute but will help me in life if I ever had to do another purchase in any point in life. I highly recommend working with Benjamin he'll work tirelessly for you and your family no matter how hard or how far he has to go.,5.0

39,"May 25, 2017","One word: HORRIBLE. Took my 535 with 20k miles for regular service and brakes, they just changed the engine oil. They didn’t check my fluids (still my windshield washer light was on) and still had problem with my brakes (car shakes when I was braking) they said it is not time to change the brakes.xxx. Took the car to another dealer and they change the brakes with no problem.Never go back.",1.4

41,"May 07, 2017","I was looking to buy a used black 2016 535.  Dealership had two on its website and I had an email exchange about the cars on a Thursday afternoon and said I would be out Friday for a test drive.  Show up on Friday and they are completely clueless about where the cars are (they say maybe there are in service?), then they tell me that they had sold both to other dealerships.  Thanks for the heads up before I made the drive.

Then the salesman says, why don't you drive a white one since you are here so you will know if you like the drive.  I say ""okay.""  My wife and I ask to drive the car alone and was told that this was not allowed.  What????  I have test driven many cars alone as long as I have left a license.  In fact, after we left we went to another dealership and when I asked to test drive the car with just my wife, the response was, ""of course, no problem.""

So we all pile in and go for a test drive.  I ask why is this car several thousand dollars more than the ones I had come out to see.  Salesman says he has no idea but will check when we get back.  We get back and he tells me, ""oh, that was in the ""M line.""  In other words, the test drive was a waste becuase I was not looking at the ""M line.""

Compete waste of two hours.

43,"April 26, 2017","My husband and I drove from Frisco to Arlington to see what minis they had available. We made it there right before closing and the manager and the sales associate, Bailey took their time showing me every car I wanted to see and answering any questions I had. Bailey even offered to take me for a ride after an hour pass their closing time.  I was stressed because I felt really bad keeping them open so late on a weeekend but they were so nice and patient with me and all my questions. We drove 50 min from Frisco.   Bailey was super nice and genualy caring.  She didn't come across as just a sales person.  She even contacted me to make sure everything was going well with my new car the following business day.  I was concerned about getting my car washes and stuff done in Arlington since I live in Frisco but she said Tony might would be able to help me out with contacts at the plano location.  Too many miles would be added on to my new Mini having to drive it to Arlington every time.   I enjoyed working with Tony and Bailey and wish they were at the plano dealership.  They were very nice and have continued to be even after they sold me the car unlike most people in sales. ",4.6

BMW Arlington
I took my 2006 BMW 650I convertible to BMW Arlington for an oil change and to diagnose a problem with the GPS and a seat belt sensor. I spoke to Joshua Boller Service Consultant, this man was super nice and very helpful, an unbelievable employee. 
BMW Arlington had my car for 2 days, the service was done to my car and I was given several quotes for repair work for different things. One, I was informed that I had an oil leak from the front upper oil pan and given a $1750.00 quote to repair this leak.  Another, I was given a $1400.00 quote to repair some wiring that had been “cut” I was told. I declined those repairs as it is an older car with more than 100,000 miles on it so I didn’t want to put that kind of money into it. I drove the car very little over the next few months, watching the oil level when I did use it. 
On 2/16/2017, a friend that owns an auto repair shop and I were talking and he said let’s put your BMW on the lift and see that oil leak. I took it to his shop and watched him lift the car. Under the car you could see oil spray down the center of the car and oil dripping from the front of the engine. He shined a flashlight up and you could clearly see the oil coming from the front of the valve covers, dripping down the engine. He said “That’s not an upper oil pan leak”. He took the car off of the lift and removed the air breather cover and clearly visible was oil coming from the front of the valve covers. He showed me where 3 bolts on each valve cover were loose and where a socket had knocked the dust from the bolts and all 6 bolts were loosened to allow oil to leak from the covers. He tightened these bolts and cleaned the oil from the engine and “Presto” NO MORE OIL LEAK.
He also looked in the trunk, (Something I hadn’t done) and showed me where the wiring harness to the trunk lid had several wires cut. These were exposed and the rubber protection covers had been cut away and were lying in the trunk. All of the plastic rivets were removed and missing.   All of the trunk interior covers were removed and hanging loose. NONE of this was that way when I took my car to BMW. 
I was so disturbed by what I had seen. My friend said it looked to him like the wiring and oil leak were done on purpose to cause the oil leak and run up the price at BMW. He suggested that I go to BMW and talk to the service manager because if someone that worked for him had done that he would want to know and he would fire them.
On 02/17/2017, I went to BMW Arlington and walked in and talked to Joshua Boller. I had him look up the quotes and informed him of what had occurred and he assured me that he did not believe that anyone at BMW would have done that. I said that as a courtesy to the dealership I wanted to bring it to their attention. I DIDN’T WANT ANYTHING, I was disturbed by what I had seen for myself and felt that going there and informing them was a courtesy to them because they may have a problem and don’t know it. I didn’t want someone else to be a victim. Had I blindly authorized the work, it would have cost more than $4000.00. I asked him to get the service manager so I could talk to him and he did.
I do not remember the man’s name when he introduced himself to me as the Service Manager, because he immediately gave me attitude. I relayed the story to him and he all but called me a liar, he even insisted “I’m not calling you a liar, but that didn’t happen here.” I told him NO ONE ELSE HAS BEEN IN THAT CAR EXCEPT BMW. He said even the suggestion of what I was saying was “repulsive”. I told him that I was just informing them to be alert because they may have a problem that they were not aware of. He was extremely curt and rude. Nothing like how I had been treated by ALL of the other employees at BMW that I had spoken to. He told me that he had looked up who had worked on my car and said HE is “One of my team leaders”, I do spot checks on all of my people and they do excellent work and no one would risk their “$100,000.00 job to do that, they all do excellent work”.
I asked him to come to my car parked outside and I showed him inside the trunk where everything is disconnected and removed lying in the trunk and asked I asked him “Is this the kind of excellent work your team leader does?” He simply turned and walked away. I then left the dealership.
I have never been treated like this before and was embarrassed that I had even involved Joshua Boller, he is an excellent employee. I believe he was embarrassed as well and I apologize to him here for even involving him. 
The service manager was arrogant, rude, condescending, and should be reprimanded. Had this man simply said thank you for the information and stated he would look into it they would still have a customer, but he didn’t.
I have seen people with hundreds, even thousands of dollars in their pocket caught shoplifting, most of the time for minor items! Why would they do that? Who knows? If this service manager is so naïve to think that there is not a possibility that someone working there could have done this, then HE should be replaced.
I am convinced after personally looking at the evidence and seeing what they tried to sell me in repairs that someone at BMW is doing something they shouldn’t be doing in service and repairs. Was the oil leak “created”? Were the wires cut there? Is this a “One person issue” or does it go deeper? 
I paid more than $500.00 for the diagnosis and feel like I was taken advantage of. I will never use BMW Arlington again and will provide my story and opinion to all that will listen.
Don’t blindly accept huge repair bills, get a second opinion, it saved me thousands of dollars.
I have posted this because I feel that everyone should be aware of ALL OF THE INFORMATION.

116,"June 10, 2016","We came in to the dealership, drove the car, and agreed upon a price to be finalized when we were able to inspect the vehicle in-person after the dealership formally certified that the car met the BMW Certified Pre-Owned (""CPO"") standards.  

During our negotiations, we pointed out that the tires appeared to be fairly worn and not what we would expect from a CPO vehicle.  However, the dealership assured us that the car would be checked over and would meet the CPO standards.  Once we received notice that the car was ""certified"" and ready for pickup a few days later, the dealership sent over the final, signed CPO checklist for our review and we saw that they only replaced 1 of the 4 tires despite all 4 previously looking fairly worn. 

Once we arrived at the dealership to look over the car with our salesperson (Ric Ramirez - who was new to the dealership, but was helpful), it was obvious even from using a penny to estimate the tread that there was not even close to required CPO depth.  Brian Carpenter, sales manager, subsequently came out with a tread measurement tool and then called the service manager who also confirmed our findings that NONE of the four original tires met the CPO standards.  After spending about three additional hours at the dealership due to this tire issue, we ended up getting all four new tires on the car and completed the purchase.

We will likely never know whether this was a deliberate attempt to avoid replacing tires in order to save money or if someone inexperienced and unsupervised completed the CPO evaluation/checklist on the car.  Either way, the CPO checklist was signed off on by multiple employees.  In addition, the sales manager assured us that the tires were fine when we inquired.  If we had not researched the BMW CPO tire standards and measured the tires ourselves,  I would have been stuck buying 3 additional new (and very expensive) tires in a few months. 

I understand from Yelp and other online reviews that the dealership has suffered significantly from bad customer satisfaction.  Our salesperson assured us when we asked about the situation that the dealership had taken several steps to rectify the problems identified.  However, my experience only reinforces the other customer experiences and the apparent ongoing problems.  As someone who manages personnel in a business focused on customer satisfaction, I only hope this constructive criticism can lead to positive change in the future.",1.4

When I told the service manager that he said, ""you need to talk to Bonnie"".  I left the dealership two hours later in a new BMW 3-series and have leased from her ever since.  I leased another 3 series from her, then she moved me into a 5 series in last May I drove off in the 4 series convertible.  

I drive to Arlington every three years because of her.  Everyone at the dealership seems great actually.
The sales manager is terrific.

142,"May 22, 2016","When my BMW got to the last 6 months of my lease term, I received a call from Debbie Wilson about my lease-end options.  From the minute Debbie said ""hello"" and introduced herself, it was readily apparent her primary interest was helping me understand my lease-end options and making the lease-return process as smooth and surprise-free as possible.  When I told her I was still enjoying my car and happy to keep it until the lease ended, Debbie was completely understanding, and made no effort to pressure me to get out of my car before I was ready.  Over the next few months, Debbie would check in with me to see if I had any questions, and to find out if I'd begun considering what I might get next.  I told her I was thinking about either another BMW or a Mini.  Debbie made no attempt to pressure me into either one.  Instead, she worked with me by letting me know what models where available and the various options and pricing for each.  When the time came, I decided to go with a Mini.  Even though Debbie didn't work at the Mini store, she stuck with me throughout the entire process or selecting and purchasing my Mini.  Never once did I feel ""sold""; rather, I felt like I had a friend who was truly interested in making sure I got the right car for me at great price.  And, even since buying my new car, I still get follow up messages from Debbie making sure I'm enjoying the car and seeing if there is anything else she can do to make my before- and after-the sale experience with BMW/Mini of Arlington the best it can be.  She has succeeded in spades.  I can't recommend Debbie and the entire team at BMW/Mini of Arlington highly enough.

Although I would never expect it of him, he's always looking to go out of his way to do something extra for me, or to make the transaction a little smoother.    

I recently had an interaction with a different dealership (different brand), leasing a vehicle for my business.  It was a very different experience, which is what led me to leave this review.   I've heard others talk about dreading buying a car or dealing with a salesman (I'm a salesman myself) which seemed strange as I enjoy the process immensely.  Working with the other dealer made me realize that Bryan approaches the process differently - he enters the transaction expecting to do business with you again, so everything he does is consistent with earning your business again.   

Although he's too humble to verbalize it, a look around at the plaques on the floor in his office would confirm that I'm not the only one who appreciates what how he does business.  ",5.0

177,"February 01, 2016","TL:DR – I have not found a better car than a BMW, but this dealership has made me hate the brand so much, I can wait to get rid of this car. I dread the days I have to deal with them. 

Explanation:
Let’s start with routine service. Out of 3 services I have had here, 2 have gone horribly bad. 
1 – This is when it was Moritz BMW, the process went flawless in and out. 
2 – Came in for a routine oil change, and it took over a week to get my car back. After the 3rd day, I had to reach out to them every day to see if I could get any information. Every time no information or ETA was given. They acted offended that I even called.
3 – Came in for a routine oil change and 40k miles maintenance. The associate asked if my tires has been aligned without even seeing the car. They have not, since the car still drives true. Magically it was reported that my tires were low and had to be replaced for $1500. The tires were replaced 4 months prior and had more than enough tread. So I checked for uneven wear and saw no signs. I measured both the inside and outside of the tires, both reported the same tread depth.

Now on to the lease return…
I brought my car in for a pre-lease inspection. They did their walk through, and found every minor scratch and/or dent. The car has over 40k miles, it’s going to have minor scratches from everyday use. Based on their inspection, I would have to pay ~$2,200 to return the car. I was baffled, to which they said we should go talk to the sales rep to see if we could reach a deal. At this point, I was irritated and let them know there was no way I would be buying another car from them. This is when they turned worse than the stereotypical “used car” salesmen. They went back over the car and found another ~$800 worth of damage that need to be repaired. 

When asked if I could use a third party to inspect my car, they repeated that they were “taking care of me” and the inspector would tear me apart. 

I am talking with BMW finical to see if can switch dealerships so I never have to deal with these people again. Here’s hoping.

After working with corporate, they offered a 20% discount on the services. Yesterday, I received a call that the new estimate was $3,500 (of course, it went up in line with the discount I was going to receive). When I picked up the car today, was then told that was a miscommunication and the $3,500 included the 20% off. $3,500 for a car that is barely valued above that now (2009). Up until 2 years ago, I loved my Mini and the service was always good.

From sales to service, this has been the worst new car buying experience that I've had. They took over 8 weeks to get my plates in and continually lied to me about when they would be in. Ultimately, it turns out they never sent the paperwork in and had someone run and do it the day I called and made a final threat. I tried to take the Mini Cooper in today to have someone look at the dripping water in the floor board of the drivers side and when I got there, their records showed that the car was sold to someone else and had no idea of who I was. The service adviser took half an hour to attempt to update the info and left me sitting several times to keep going to get info from my car. He seemed to know nothing about the software he was using and was typing my info in at a painfully slow two finger typing method. I told them that I was in a rush and still, he kept getting frustrated at the software and could not schedule my service, even though it was supposed to already be scheduled. I finally left after it was obvious we were getting nowhere. 

They all act as if it's their first day on the job. I wish I had bought from a different dealership. Terrible and frustrating is all I can say about each person that I've dealt with. They don't communicate with you or seemingly amongst themselves internally. I would give minus stars if that were possible. ",1.2

189,"February 19, 2014",Purchased a preowned Cadillac SRX last March.  After driving it for about a month I started noticing tire wear on both front tires.  I took it to my mechanic and was told both front tire hubs were bad.  I took the car back to what was Moritz to have the repairs done for free since I had only had the SRX for a month.  I was told that I would have to cover the costs.  I finally negotiated it to where they would fix it for free if I paid for the parts.  I was out for the parts and two new tires.  Not a fun experience.  Never going back there again even with new owners ,1.8
190,"November 11, 2013","This is my third BMW from Moritz and I have to say that I keep coming back due to the EXCEPTIONAL service I receive each and every time from Doug Mayberry. He is always willing to answer any questions or concerns no matter WHAT TIME or how MANY times I call him. If there is an answer and he doesn't know it he will get it, if their is a car that he doesn't have he will find it. When interacting with Doug I don't feel like I am interacting with a ""salesman"" but with a friend that can not be taught:) I have referred numerous people to Moritz and always tell them to ask for Doug as he will make sure that he does his best to take care of what you are needing. His dedication, do diligence, and work ethic represents true class and professionalism for Moritz and for that reason I will not go anywhere else:) He is an amazing asset to the Moritz BMW family:)

193,"October 30, 2013","The reason why I purchased my X1 BMW was because John Alexander was so helpful in helping me decide what type of vehicle I needed within the BMW family.  We special ordered my X1. It came in earlier than promised.   I previously purchased a pre-owned BMW from Moritz in 1998 and that transaction went well and their service department was fine although I only had to use them once.   
John Alexander really follows up and watches out for his customers,  It is rare to receive the kind of quality sales service John provides.  I cannot say enough good things about John,   Also John helped save me an additional $1000 by locating my Ultimate Drive voucher for me. He also assisted me in getting a fair price on my trade in.

From all 3 locations we received horrible PUSHY service.  Finally we stopped for lunch and I used that time to hit the internet to see what I could find.  I found a used Cadillac that I really liked at Moritz, so I called and inquired.  I was directed to Mr. Doug Mayberry who answered my questions and invited us in.  Once we arrived he greeted us at the door with a smile and offered us drinks.  THATS GOOD SERVICE IF YOU ASK ME!!!!  After that we chatted in his office for a while and I loved his honesty!!  He kept it real!!  He brought a vehicle around that we absolutely fell in love with!  I was very nervous thinking to myself this is too nice for me to afford.  My husband and I have not so perfect credit, so I thought that would add more of an issue.  Throughout the whole process Mr. Mayberry kept reassuring me that it was going to be alright!  Shortly after Mr. Tony Canady came in and said you guys are approved, but he didnt like the deal. He said give me a few minutes to submit to another lender.  !5 minutes later we were jumping for joy listening to the news that we had a beautiful Cadillac that we could actually afford!!!!

216,"August 04, 2013","From my first call to new car sales, I knew Moritz BMW was more interested in helping meet my needs than they were in simply making a sale.  Before calling Moritz, I went on-line a ""built"" a couple of different models, and submitted a request for a brochure and a price quote.  The dealer that contacted me is conveniently located close to my office in downtown Dallas.  I told the dealer what I was looking for a manual transmission model only; the dealer told me:  (i) they did not have any in stock; (ii) manual transmission models are scarce; and (iii) it would be very hard for them to get one unless I ordered it specially it, which would take approximately 60 days.  The dealer then attempted to sell me on one of their in-stock automatic models.  After I reiterated that I was only interested in manual transmission models, the dealer lost interest.

Then, I called Moritz BMW and was introduced to David Decker.  I was immediately impressed -- David LISTENED to what I told him, and he immediately proposed a ""game plan"" for finding a manual transmission model that matched, as best as possible, the features and options that were available.  David called me back that same morning, told me what he'd found, and asked me whether any of the models he located would work for me.  As it turns out, the car I wanted was located at an unaffiliated BMW dealership in Florida.  Complicating matters further, I was set to close on my house refinancing in a couple days and, therefore, needed to avoid having any credit inquiries run until after the closing.  The dealership, on the other hand, was just a few days from month-end, which is when the financial incentives/terms would expire.  Also, the dealership couldn't actually secure the car in Florida until I agreed to purchase the car (sight unseen and without a test-drive).

I'm still not sure how, but David and the Moritz team somehow managed to get it all figured out AND executed with perfect timing.  Because of David, buying this car was not only the easiest car purchase I've ever had (and I've purchased 10 new cars in the last 10 years), it was the single best retail sales experience of any kind that I can remember having (from the ""first-time best-pricing"" to the more-than-fair trade value to keeping every promise made to making delivery of the car ... everything was just exceptional).

221,"July 24, 2013","We stopped by Moritz after dealing with one of the other BMW dealerships in the Metroplex. The other dealership presented a deal to us to trade in our current car for a new BMW, but we wanted to compare, just to make sure. We went to Moritz because of their higher ratings on this site. We're glad we did, as we ended up purchasing from them.

In our 35+ years of buying many vehicles, my wife and I would have to rate Moritz BMW as one of the top dealerships we've ever dealt with.  They are honest, fair, friendly, true to their word- and made the usually difficult process of buying a car relatively simple. We dealt with David Decker in BMW sales and he was great- he's very knowledgeable about his product and was able to guide us through the various options on our car. He's a ""no pressure"" kind of guy (which we appreciated very much) and, after the sale, continually kept us updated on the progress of our car as it was being built. (We had special ordered some items).

We even had a good experience in the finance department...Robb Leyda made that process easy as well and presented us some financing options (we ended up leasing- a first for us) after he explained the various pluses and minuses of buying versus leasing- again, with no pressure applied either way.

In regards to her taste, she first wanted a Chevy Corvette. Over and beyond her price range. Then being the good husband that I am, I decided to assist her. I didn't have to think about it long because I already knew what my choice would be. The MINI Cooper!  Yes indeed!!! I have seen and touch the MINi at the Dallas and Fort Worth Auto Shows the last few years. I told her we are going to the MINI Dealer in Arlington.  When we arrived 30 minutes before our arranged appointment, Samantha Miller greeted us with open arms and a smile. The process begin and the rest is History. Samantha made our experience easy and exciting. My wife had a list of things she wanted in a car and Samantha made sure we had them and a lot more. Just to name a few, color, horsepower, 2-seat only, and spectacular outside and inside interior. Wow! Wow,Wow! That is what my wife has been saying sense she drove the test car. She is thrilled, amazed, and over-joyed. She may have waited 25 years for the car of her dreams, but the MINI COUPE S makes her feel 25 years younger.

252,"May 23, 2013","I went to 2 other BMW dealerships in the Dallas area. I knew exactly what I was looking for, having been to the BMW website.
The first did not have a car that I wanted and to my knowledge the salesman did not look for a car with my required options. At least he never called to say what he located.
The second dealership actually had 3 cars that I would have been happy with. I tried to make a deal on the one that best suited my needs/wants. It happened to be a demo. They would not deal with me even though the car had 3000+ miles on it. Their best offer simply did not take into account that the car, while new, had been used as a demo.  
In looking on line to find my own car, I was put into contact through, Edmund's, to Moritz BMW of Arlington and Charlie Thompson.
I returned his email at about 7pm, which was very prompt in arriving, and told him what I was looking for. They did not have a car that fit my needs but Charlie said that he would look online at sister dealers to see if he could find a car that fit my list of options.  Based on the previous two experiences at the other dealerships, I figured that I would never hear back from him.  Behold!!! He called me back within 30 to 60 minutes and said that he had located a car that met my requirements !!! The car was being built but  I didn't want to wait. The next day he called me to tell me that he had located a car for me at a sister dealer in Georgia. It had everything that I wanted. I told him that I was very interested and that I had just had my car at CarMax to see what I could get for my car.  He took that information to the people who make the financial decisions and in a VERY timely manner, Charlie called me back to tell me what they could sell me the car for, contingent on the trade-in process.
The price for a brand new car with 14 miles (not 3000+ miles) with the same options was offered to me well below the price the other dealership said was their absolute bottom dollar for the demo car that I had liked!!!  I made an appointment to go see Charlie and the people at Moritz BMW of Arlington.  They had to arrange to have the car shipped to them, so I did not get the car immediately. However, Charlie gave me a status report daily! I knew exactly what was going on at any given time.  What peace of mind!

The experience from beginning to end was GREAT.  I got a car that I love at a great price according to everything I researched on the web.
They shipped my car to Moritz BMW of Arlington and I went to pick it up and close the deal a few days later.  Everything was ready when I got there. The car was exactly as promised and the purchase process went very smoothly.  Even though the extended warranty, tire and wheel protection plan and dent guard plan was offered, there was absolutely NO pressure to purchase them.

To say how I feel about my experience with Moritz BMW of Arlington in a very short sentence: This is exactly how car buying/selling should be done!
Kudos to Charlie Thompson and the very nice people at Moritz BMW of Arlington!!!",5.0

When I entered the dealership I was professionally greeted then introduced to Victor Noble (my sales professional).  I have bought from high-end dealerships in the past but my experience at Moritz BMW was unmatched.  Mr. Noble made the entire process of buying a BMW easy and painless.  This was one of the few times I actually enjoyed the automotive purchasing experience.  Everything was done exactly as Mr. Noble said it would be.  I was further impress by the the finance department.  Ken Moore worked very hard to insure I received the best interest rate possible.  I was in and out of his office in just a few moments.  He not only had everything ready he also showed the same care and concern my salesman showed.  I remember thinking ""this is the best car buying experience ever!""

Samantha greeted us, found out what we were looking for and what we wanted and then told us what she had available to show us.  She immediately pulled up a vehicle off the lot and started going over some of the options on that particular car, handed over the key, gave us directions for a test drive (my husband and I were test driving a mini roadster which is a 2 seater) and told us to have fun!!!  She was available when we got back, answered our questions and gave us time to go explore the car and talk.  We drove the car again.  Came back and went over some numbers. Samantha suggested we drive it on the highway and told us how to get to the highway and a route to take.  Once again when we returned, she answered more questions and started the process.  Never, at any time, was she pushy!! She was always there to answer questions, offer guidance and to help but never push, and even though she was the only manager in MINI that particular day, never made us feel like she didn't have time for us to take our time.  When we sat down to go over numbers, she gave us the best number up front - no haggling. After signing all the papers, she had my car pulled into the showroom floor, shiny and full of gas!!! She went over all the necessary instructions on the computers and was very helpful in setting up the on board computers.   Samantha made the entire process fun and (as painless as possible)!

Joey made the car shopping experience very stress free. I was driving from over an hour away and he very diligently worked out every detail of our deal before I ever left my house that evening. From the negotiated price of the used car to the trade in we had, he connected us with the finance department and everything was ready to go when we arrived that evening. We were in and out in not much more then an hour, WOW! And when we discovered that one of the keys had not been turned in by the previous owner Joey made strides to get the extra key for us, he is actually still working on that! My wife and I have not purchased a car from a dealership since 1996 because of the negative experience's we have had, Joey and Moritz changed all that! I tend to try to get as much life out of my vehicles as possible and probably will not replace our other car for a couple years, but when I do, or when I learn of anyone thats car shopping the first place I am going to send them is to Moritz and Joey Edwards!

303,"April 03, 2013","I purchased a ""Certified Pre-Owned"" BMW.  I have been so uncomfortable and very unsatisfied with my overall experience.  I felt rushed, pressured and could not seemed to find anyone that would assist me.  
One of the main issues that I had a problem with was the tires on my ""Certified"" vehicle.  The tires were worn badly, there was very little rubber and the right front tires were worn the worst especially on the otter part of the tire.  I mentioned this issue several times to my sales associate and I was ignored.  
Now almost five months later I am being told that I need new tires for the front and back and I also need an alignment!  
Since I have purchased this ""Certified Pre-Owned"" vehicle, September 29, it has needed new brakes, a recall on wiring that i was not made aware of, a new radio, alignment, new wheels and tire/rim replacements all around and sensors replaced.  Now that is a lot of repairs for a ""Certified Pre-Owned Vehicle"" that was just purchased almost five months ago.

This is an experience that I would not suggest for my worst supervisor and that is bad.

I had 2011 Acura MDX that still had about a year left on the lease.  Timothy greeted us at the door.  He was a very polite and nice young man..  My intention was to wait until the lease was up but, my wife liked the car so well and Timothy talked her into a test drive we decided we could take the Honda we owned that was paid for and trade it in and keep the Acura and the Mini.  Timothy showed her the amenities available and they began to pick out the options she wanted. They ended up with a complete package.  I took photos of the Honda when I got home and sent them along with the VIN and waited.  The next day, Timothy called with an offer.  The trade-in on my Honda was terrible so, I said no thanks and forgot it.   A couple days later Brian Carpenter called me.  During the conversation the lease on the Acura came up.  Brian suggested I trade the Acura which I didn't know you could do.  We worked out a deal.. We ordered a Mini Countryman S All 4, Timothy met us half way.. We delivered the Acura to him.  Six weeks later our Countryman came in and we picked it up..  Timothy and Brian had all the paperwork ready.. while I signed Timothy showed my wife the features and we were off the lot in less that half the time I thought it would take.. I can't remember the finance guy's name but he was very thorough and seemed to be waiting for me to get there...  So, far my dealings with Moritz and the folks I have met have been very pleasant. I would and have recommended the dealership to others.",5.0

I also like that all of the cars currently in inventory can be looked at from their web site so that I have a very good idea of the exact cars that I am interested in looking at before going over to the dealership.

We talked and he gave me a price, it was right where I wanted to be (actually a bit less) and I said ""lets do it"". They didn't have a mini that I wanted but Timothy found one for me and had it shipped to the dealer. 
Timothy did all the work I just said yes or no, it was so easy. I felt right at home and they were very concerned that I was happy with the deal.
So far I am very impressed with Moritz and I'm looking forward to having my mini serviced just to see if my service experience equals my sales experience.

I have an extremely demanding job and a ten month old baby so my time to shop around was extremely limited. Dextral found exactly what I wanted and presented a great deal that did not require much negotiating at all. We conducted our negotiations via email and telephone and I completed the credit app electronically. The only reason I went down to the dealership was to sign the contract and pick up my car. It was efficient and simple and I couldn't be more pleased with the level of customer service I received from Moritz once again. I will continue to purchase my vehicles from Dextral for as long as he is at this dealership.

340,"February 01, 2013","Three years ago we decided to lease a new BMW, our first luxury car. We visited the dealerships in Dallas and Plano and found no 3 series SUVs to lease. The sales persons we visited were also very busy and never followed up with us. The experience at BMW Dallas was pretty bad, as the sales person was a bit rude and even recommended that we stick to used cars and not lease a new one.

We decided to try the Moritz BMW as a last resort before heading over to Lexus. To our surprise, the sales person was very helpful. She not only discounted a new BMW X3 but also showed us several options for leasing or purchase. She also helped in locating the right car that would suit our requirements and ordered it for us. It took 2 weeks to arrive and the entire transaction went very smoothly. We also got several follow up emails AFTER the purchase asking us if we had any issues with the car.

The Moritz BMW service wing helped us out with very service request and questions that we had. For every service call, we were given an awesome BMW Loaner car and our car was serviced in the time period that was mentioned to us. We never paid for any of the services as they were covered in the lease.

Almost 6 months prior to the expiry of the lease, We were approached by Bonnie Shinsky from Moritz with a follow up on the lease expiration. She provided us with various options and specials that were available. Although we weren't unsure of extending the lease or purchasing the BMW X3, We finally decided to explore a new BMW 5 series car or renew/purchase the existing car. Bonnie showed us the price differences with the options and also discounted the car. We went ahead with a new lease and turned in the old SUV as a trade-in, which worked out better than returning the lease. 

A few days later Bonnie called back and mentioned that we had left our check book in the old car. She mailed it back to us promptly!

We wholeheartedly recommend Moritz BMW and Bonnie in particular, if you're exploring on leasing/purchasing a BMW.  You will not be disappointed in anyway!",5.0

372,"December 27, 2012","I recently purchased a BMW from Moritz, and the salesperson who worked with me from start to finish was Dextral Harris.  I've owned and driven many cars, but had never driven a BMW before visiting the dealership.  I went there after having conducted my own online research of the model that I was interested in, and determined that their inventory offers best matched my wants and needs.     

While my girlfriend and I were looking around the cars outside, Dextral introduced himself to us, and asked if he could answer any questions.  I told him that I was looking into buying a BMW, but had never actually driven one.  After stating this, he asked me if I would like to test drive a car that evening.  My answer -yes.  He handed me the keys to the cars that I chose to test drive fairly quickly, and I wasn't questioned about where I worked, what I drive now, what I would possibly put down, etc.  The test drive went great.  

I didn't buy on my first visit, there were other great close contenders.  When I did ask Dextral for opinions, he offered suggestions which really helped assist me during the serious decision-making process.  In the end, I got an amazing car.  

I can summarize my overall experience at the dealership as respectful and positive.  The basis of my opinion draws greatly from the degree of efforts by Dextral in relation to his assistance to me when I requested working out a more equitable term of sale with the dealership for my vehicle-which he was able to make happen, as well as his professional customer service.

374,"December 23, 2012","What can I say?  This is my third MINI, and third from Moritz MINI!  Moritz hires the nicest, most knowledgeable staff.  My salesguy, Brian McNulty, is a perfect example.  MINI's sell themselves, for the most part, but, when you need human assistance, Brian is the guy to have, especially when you are switching models.  I went from a three year old MINI Cooper S, to a 2012 MINI Cooper Countryman S ALL4.  I wanted a bigger MINI, and the Clubman was wasn't quite there.  Moritz and MINI were having a tantalizing sale on the 2012's, complete with amazing financing.  I think I drove all the Countrymen S's available at Moritz.  Patient man, that Brian is.  After we worked through the numbers, it was to Finance, always slightly scary for me.  Not to worry!  Kim Green makes it easy. I would be remiss, if I didn't mention the Service Department, and my Service Advisor, Tony Segreti.  You don't find yourself at the Service Department often with a MINI, but sometimes something about its MINIness will surprise, and you need an answer.  Tony's your man.  He's easy to work with, accessible, and always patient with dumb questions, of which I've had a few! Buy your MINI from Moritz.  You can't go wrong.

They showed me a car with a unique interior color and I thought it looked ok. I was straight forward with the salesperson that I was dealing with the Austin dealership. I left and called my salesperson in Austin and he said that they could do a dealer trade with Mortiz. The next day I get a call from the Mortiz salesperson and asked if I requested a dealer trade, I said yes. He replied with an angry voice that they were not going to release the vehicle an proceeded to say I wasted his time. He said the only way I would get the car would be to buy it directly from them. I wasn't going to be bullied to buy a car from them so I said thank you but I will order the car.  Their sales tactic reminds me why I hate buying cars. I'm lucky that Austin BMW have better acting sales people that Mortiz. I ordered by car and save money by not having to pay for the dealer trade transport fee.

All 3 of the cars came from Moritz in Arlington, Texas.  It is a great dealership.

Now for my salesman.  Marco Lopez.  He is the absolute BEST salesman at Moritz MINI!!!  He was always there for me when I needed to ask a question and believe me, I had lots of them! Lol.  He made sure that everything was perfect!  He made sure everything went smoothe all the way from actually buying the car to picking it up at the dealership.  

This time I built my MINI just exactly like I wanted.  My MINI took a cruise across the ocean and then made it's way to the Moritz dealership in Arlington.  

The only thing I could wish for would be a dealership in Amarillo, Texas or a little closer.  The service part of the MINI isn't so fun.  See, we live in Amarillo, Texas which is about a 7-8 hour drive away from Arlington, Texas.  So, I don't get to take advantage of the little quirks, like carwashes, that Moritz MINI offers.  Maybe someday.

Again, thanks Moritz MINI and Marco Lopez.  You are the BEST?

He listens well to his customers and comes up with the best car for them. John knows that every customer is unique and will spend the extra time to find the exact car for you. I came in at 3:00 pm and we drove two cars, did the paperwork with Tony who is also another admirable member of the Moritz staff. John detailed my new car himself, and then sat with me and fed any personal setting he could into the car, blue tooth for my phone, radio stations, blinker setting the list goes on and on.

I can't stress enough the impression David left on me the moment he greeted me. He was helpful on determining what car I needed in reference to my wants. What stood out the most was how I could tell he wanted to sell me a car, however was NEVER pushy or upset that I had to go talk to the wife before buying. He stayed in touch with me for the few days after my initial visit and made me feel good about the entire experience. I ended up with a 2013 BMW 550i and I can't tell you how much we love it. I had considered the model below this one because of price, however in listening to my wants David recommended the 550i instead. I can tell you it was not because it was more expensive but because I like power. Today while he gave me a complementary detail he gave me the car I wanted to begin with as a loaner and I can tell you now I would not have been near as happy with it. David's professionalism stood out to me right there because he didn't let me make a mistake.

429,"October 23, 2012","I shopped all of the local dealers, and had decided that price was going to be the bottom line, willing to sacrifice service. BMW has great service, and I was not so concerned about the dealership. I used the internet to shop, and Charlie Thompson was the sales rep that responded. I told him what the deal he had to beat was, and that I was not willing to play games.

Charlie called back within 15 minutes, and said he could do everything I requested. I kept waiting for the ""but"", which never came. Charlie made the process so simple that I kept waiting for the ""catch"". 

I can honestly say that this dealership, including the F&I, are honest, straight forward, and absolutely no hassle. I have never felt the need to write a review before, but after the great service, I feel that I owe it to them and others that are shopping.

At no time did this dealership attempt to play games, or change the terms of the very first verbal agreement.

I have already recommended the dealership, and plan on buying my wifes car through the same dealer.",5.0

I was always treated better at Honda dealerships. Well, I saw on their website 2 new 335d models for sale. I called Bobby Murphy and went up to do business. I get there, am told one is in the body shop and looked at the other. It had over 10,000 miles on it, price was full out retail. I was told that ""cars often have incorrect mileage on the Internet due to a ""glitch"". Really?

434,"October 15, 2012","I have purchased seven BMW's over the last 15 years. The last three have been through Moritz because the service is phenomenal beyond words. Moritz is the only dealership where I have purchased or leased a BMW, and actually had a pleasant experience. From the sales manager, to the staff and finance manager, the service, and how I have always been treated, is beyond exceptional. Even though I reside in Austin, Texas, I will always drive to Arlington and purchase from Moritz BMW.  I cannot thank Ken Osterloh enough for continuing to take such good care of me, and making the purchase of my new BMW fun! Ken even followed up with me on Sunday, his day off, to make sure everything was going well with my new vehicle. I highly recommend Moritz BMW to anyone interested in purchasing a vehicle, new or used. I guarantee it will be unlike any other car buying experience imaginable, and you will be treated fairly and with the utmost respect. Thank you Ken, Tony and Robb for taking excellent care of me over the last 5 1/2 years.

437,"October 07, 2012","Charlie ""Chuck"" Thompson was such a fabulously helpful and knowledgable sales associate.

I basically bought my car through us mail and over the phone after touching base with Mr. Thompson; the Internet director. Charlie was so great. He emailed me the availability of possible cars with all the specs and packages I was looking for-- before I even stepped foot on the lot! He was punctual, helped me set everything up very easily, and even gave me his cell number just so he could keep me informed of my check status, paperwork, and when the deal was finalized. He sent paperwork back and forth to California; where my husband is stationed (USMC) and didn't mind going the extra mile time and time again for us!

I joked with the initial customer service woman-who called to get feedback the next working day- that Charlie needed a raise. He was just fabulous, and I'm so so glad that I bought my loaded-out 328i///M with all the bells and whistles from the Moritz family. I will never go anywhere else for my car buying needs: Moritz BMW of North Arlington is the cream of the crop.

442,"September 27, 2012","I visited the Moritz BMW dealership for the first time last Saturday,9/22/12. I was INSTANTLY greeted by Doug Mayberry as I was walking toward the building. He was very professional and immediately took the necessary time to sit with me to discuss my options for purchasing a BMW. At the time, I was deliberating between a coupe and a sedan. He PATIENTLY detailed the differences between the two types of cars and their associated amenities. When I left the dealership, I was fully equipped with all the information needed to make an informed decision. I returned to Moritz on Monday, 9/24/12 to take one last test drive. I was VERY indecisive, but Doug was patient yet again and gave me the time I needed to make my decision (without hassling or rushing me). As a result of his great salesmanship, I am now the proud owner of a BMW 5 Series!!!!   

Prior to my visit to Moritz, I visited two other BMW dealerships within the D/FW metroplex. The impeccable customer service I received at Moritz FAR EXCEEDED their competitors. I will gladly refer family and friends to Moritz for their next purchase.

448,"September 19, 2012","When our 1999 Suburban was unexpectedly totaled, we had to locate a vehicle quickly.  We looked at several other dealerships.  My 17 year old daughter located the car via Autotrader.  I asked her to contact Moritz to see if it was available, and when I could go see it, as I was about to get on a plane, and could not call myself.  She called, and reached Jody, who treated Allison with empathy and respect.  Allison was so pleased, she encouraged me to not wait until 7 PM to go and see the car, but to go at 8:30 when the dealership opened.  I was there at 8:30, met John Brunson, who facilitated a test drive by 8:45, and by 9:30 I was writing a check for a deposit to purchase the vehicle.  John's focus is the customer experience.  For that matter, that was what I saw in the Moritz staff.  We came back the next afternoon to pick up the car.  It was well detailed, and all was in order.  Ken facilitated the paperwork, and assisted in my choice of extended warranty that met my objectives.  The family all met with Jon Underwood, and Jody, and were well treated.  I have been in the car for 3 weeks now.  All details have been attended to, and we made the right choice.  I love the car, and the experience.  I will return to John to source my next car.

We met with David Decker and Joe Blakely, they both spent time with us and gave us the attention we have not experienced with other vehicle purchases.  David ""with no pressure at all"" went through all the options and offered us several suggestions and solutions.  After quick dialog my wife and I agreed to order a new one built to our specs.  David was very thorough and placed the order, followed up every week with updates via email, call and text.  

David was do generous with his time and upon delivery of our vehicle and the trading in he also informed us that the remaining warranty of our trade-in had value and we could claim it with our Odometer statement with the ones that sold it to us at a prorated amount (No telling how many vehicles i have bought warranties for that were just lost?).  I could not say more about this dealership, from the top down this dealership and the sum of its people are amazing.  They successfully made this experience one that we will always remember.

I sincerely recommend this dealership.

451,"September 13, 2012","In the spring of this year I happened to be driving past the mini dealer during one of my business sales calls.  For some strange reason I wanted to go inside and find out more about The Countryman.  I can't even remember when I first saw it but I was sold with the four doors and space for my kids.    When I arrived, Marco Lopez helped me just walk though the basics of the car and showed me how straight forward it was to customize my dream car.  I explained I was no where near ready to purchase but probably in 4-6 months.

Almost to the day, four months later I come back to the dealership ready to design my car.  Unfortunately, Marco was busy and that is when he introduced me to Brian McNulty.  We actually went though the same process that I did with Marco but it was funny to me how I changed my mind on several items I had said no to before.  Brian was extremely patient with my ADD thought process and explained in detail what the features and benefits were allowing me to make the ultimate decision.  

After probably the longest wait since childbirth, my car arrived and Brian called to just make sure of the final details.  I specifically asked for a union jack flag to be placed on my side mirrors and sunroof but selected the option of chrome everything else on my car.  Brian made sure to ensure those items were exactly what I wanted probably to ensure that there was no buyers remorse.

When I arrived to pick up my car and saw it sitting in the show room, I was floored because it almost didn't seem real.  After all the boring financial stuff, Brian walked though every detail of what I needed to know about my vehicle.

Needless to say, I had a wonderful experience with not one motor advisor but two!

We returned a week later and he again showed us the cars and let us test drive them. My husband and I wanted to surprise our daughter who was with us that day, so James worked with us in hiding from our daughter that we were actually buying the vehicle that day!

He introduced a car to me that fit my budget, but was also stylish and sporty with just enough room to comfortably carry around my toddler. Doug is friendly, knowledgable, and as helpful as he can be and once again left me with a great lasting impression.

492,"August 09, 2012","Here is the rating I posted on Yelp.com:
So I've been running around DFW trying to find a MINI and decided to drive down to Arlington and I'm really glad I did.

I went early, so the salesman, Marco, and his manager were the only people working. Both of them were so friendly - I particularly appreciated the manager actually talking to me considering most car dealership managers hide in their office to make mysterious equations and calculations about your car. She was really friendly and gave me lots of good info about the car and their dealership while Marco pulled a car around for me. 

It's so annoying to have someone selling you a car that clearly doesn't know anything about it. Thankfully, Marco was on top of his stuff. He walked me around the car, showed me how everything worked, and was really nice about answering my bajillion questions.

I later found out these salesmen don't work on commission, so that explains why they aren't slimy and pushy. Everyone was polite, friendly, and I never felt like I was being pushed into something I didn't want. 

I didn't post this on Yelp, as I just picked up the car today, but I have to comment on how incredibly helpful Marco was on the delivery of the car. I have never had a car salesman take the time to explain all of the features available to me in my car the way he did. He spent as much time as I needed to make sure I understood all of my car features and went above and beyond to show me little hidden features - things I never would have found on my own like the disco setting for the ambient lights. He clearly knows these cars inside and out and I so appreciated the time spent making sure I felt like an expert on my new car.",5.0

Frank Williams, Lubbock , Texas


Worked with Joey Edwards, Mike Allen, Ken Moore


In July 2012 I purchased a used Lexus from Moritz Cadillac in Arlington, Texas. I had found it on one of the car buying web sites.   This was my first purchase of a car over the internet and “long distance” so to speak.

I was apprehensive about having to travel 350 miles to actually see and test drive the vehicle before I made my decision about whether or not to buy it.  I was concerned about pressure from dealer and about having to make a decision much quicker than I normally do.

I first spoke with Joey Edwards.  He was very courteous and helpful.  No pressure.  He described the car and answered all of my initial questions.  After a few phone calls and a few e-mails my wife and I decided to fly to Dallas to see the car.

Because Joey was going on vacation, he handed us over to Mike Allen to guide us through the process.  Mike was very courteous and helpful as well and again, no pressure.   He offered to pick us up at the airport on a Saturday morning, in the car I was interested in so that I could get some first hand driving time back to the dealership.   

From the first moment I could see that the car was exactly as described.  From there on out the process went exactly as promised by both Joey and Mike.  We drove back to the dealership, where we dropped Mike off.  He then let us take the car for as long as we wanted.  After spending an hour or so going over the car very carefully we knew that we wanted it.

We drove back to the dealership and began to process of purchasing the car.  Everything went  smoothly, all the paperwork was professionally handled and explained by Mike and Ken Moore as we went along, and in about 45 minutes we were on our way back to Lubbock.

Bottom line – I whole-heartedly recommend Moritz in Arlington, and I especially recommend Joey and Mike.  This is a good group of people, and frankly, different from any other car dealership that I’ve ever done business with.

497,"July 31, 2012","This was the easiest, most pleasant, and fastest car purchase I have ever made.  Timothy was helpful encouraged me to test drive any car I wanted.  We test drove 3.  He was not pushy nor did he do all this running back and forth with ""What kind of payments do you want crap""  It was simple this is what I am putting down and he came back with we can do this amount and this is the interest we can get for you.  Took me next door to the financing person, Ken, and he offered me a couple of extended warranties - not pushy at all.  He got the paperwork ready and had me out in no time.  I was in and out in less than 2 hours including me test driving 3 vehicles, and me walking by and looking at every car on the lot 2 or 3 times trying to make up my mind.  This is the only time I have NOT totally and completely HATED the car buying experience.  No one tried blowing smoke or tried telling me this was the best car on the market or that it would comfortably seat 4 people or that it would last 20 years or that it was cheap to maintain.  Quite the opposite, I was told the truth about the car and everything I was told lined up with a month's worth of research I had done prior to going to look at a Mini.  I knew well what I was getting into before I ever walked on the lot but the one thing that didn't translate well from research or from Timothy or the test drives is just how much fun these cars are to drive.

Now to give you some perspective about my purchase.  I was tired of putting so many city miles on my 6.0 liter V8 with 361 horsepower Pontiac G8 GT that I love to drive and had decided to keep.  If I was going to add another car it had to be economical and more environmentally friendly than the G8.  Obviously, it is not that hard to be more economical or environmetally friendly than the G8. However, I had to deal with my psyche, so I knew fool well I could not go back to a Honda not even for a work car(I have had several Hondas in the past and they are exceptionally reliable and dependable cars they are just rather boring)  A Fiat was totally out of the question, because I think they are really ugly.  I also have to deal with the fact that I am 6'-2"" and all cars don't fit.  There have been several cars I have looked at in the past, but had to pass simply because I didn't fit.  ANd there was no way it could drive like a Prius, it was going to have to have spunk to it.  So from everything that I read and everything that I liked, I realized that if anything really stood a chance of meeting most or all of my requirements it was going to be a Mini Cooper S, Hardtop, Clubman, or Countryman.  I test drove the Countryman 1st, then the Clubman, both of which were S models and automatic transmissions, then just for grins I decided to drive a standard transmission Hardtop, an S model also.  Much to my surprise I absolutely loved the the smaller size and the standard transmission.  This is the only car I have ever had that just tickles me to drive.  I feel like a kid again when I drive it or at least much younger than 50.  One simply cannot explain the FUN factor of this car. 

Thanks to all the people at Moritz who help make this a very pleasant experience.  I hope and expect your Service Department to be as accomidating and pleasant to work with.  I will leave a review for them after I have had to deal with with them.

Thanks,
Kurt",5.0

Told me he was looking for the car I asked for.  The next day they found a car for me. When I went to the dealership they took good care of me. Brian Mcnauky was wonderful! Brought the cars to me so I wouldn't have to walk the lot. I tried out a car like I had and then I tried out a Clubman. OMG! I loved it.

505,"July 25, 2012","We LOVED Moritz Mini! After searching for a car on the internet, at dealers, and through reviews, we were READY to buy a car and knew what we wanted.

From the moment we first spoke to Samantha, we were CODDLED by her incredible ability to quickly understand our priorities, meet our needs, and offer us UNCOMPROMISING service. Before we ever had to drive to the dealership Samantha was emailing us images, price sheets, quotations, and striving to EARN our business.

Previous dealers took a more entitled view and acted as if we owed them for taking their time. Samantha earned our appreciation and respect by giving us amazing value! We purchased exactly what we wanted with no unwanted up-sells, but with the perfect upgrades for our needs.

In only a few hours time, we had found the perfect car, successfully negotiated terms, accepted unbeatable financing, and sealed the deal for a happy ride home.

I have never been so excited about buying anything. This buying experience was almost as good as our beautiful MINI with the ironclad warranties. Worry free and loving it! I would even want to invite the finance manager (Kim) and sales woman to hang out.

Did I mention that we brought along 3 kids and our dog? The kids left smiling with some new MINI T-Shirts!

He stayed late to go over all of my options when considering lease vs. buy.  I ended up buying and I ""GUESS"" they gave me a fair trade in value for my '05, I mean what do ya expect when you're too lazy to sell it out right ?!  He worked with me to give me a fair deal on the little extras that I wanted, like stripes and mirror caps.  Your MINI isn't complete w/o them!  I took delivery two days later and TJ spent about 30 minutes with me explaining ALL the features on my new Cooper S.  I feel he went well over and beyond what is expected.  I'm not exactly technologically advanced so he was so sweet to set up my blue tooth and walk me through my digital displays....ALL IN 102 degree heat!!!!!!

I love this dealership and I love the service people which is SO important because in the UNLIKELY event that I have a problem, I know they'll take care of me.  I even called my service guy to let him know that I traded my car in, in case he wanted to buy it. I have THAT kind of relationship with this place.

Mr. Darrough was so helpful and found a car within a matter of minutes that fit the description of what I wanted in my car. He offered a great deal for it but never once pressured me into the sale. After doing my research and checking out all my options I came back to this dearlership and Mr. Darrough. They were unlike any other dearership I came across in my hunt. They were invested in finding the right car for me and not just a car to make the sale. He made the whole car-buying experience easy and painless. When I picked my car up, it was in perfect condition; brand new, perfectly striped and tinted, and completely spotless. He helped me set up the features in my car and made it very clear if I had any questions to call. He has since checked on me several times to make sure I'm still pleased and I am! I love my MINI; I can't help but smile when I get in it. I have and will continue to recommend this dealership to others. It was a great experience and I am very pleased with how it all turned out!

528,"June 29, 2012","My love affair with Mortiz MINI began about seven years ago.  Several times a year I would visit and test drive my dream car - the MINI Cooper.  As new models of the car were released I would stop in, test drive, talk to a sales representative, and then plan my next visit.  I even convinced my father to buy one just so I could go with him to test drive it.  Each and every time I visited Moritz MINI I was treated with extreme care.  There was never overt pressure from the sales reps; they were simply happy to help me live out my dream (if even for a half hour).  It became a little like the TV show ""Cheers"" where I played the role of Norm.  Seven years and an act of God later (my car was totaled in a hail storm in Dallas), I walked into the dealership once again with my dream car staring me in the face.  Samantha was amazing!  We talked about my options: what I was looking for, the type of car that best suited me (including my finances), and what my timeline was.  Throughout the entire process, Samantha listened to my needs and wants, innately found vehicles that matched my personality, and patiently waited through the process that is insurance claims.  She was encouraging of my choices, and kindly entertained my energy-driven four-year-old son while we were in the dealership. She protected my interests and genuinely shared in my joy when I picked up my new MINI Cooper!  I also want to express my happiness with the BMW Finance department.  Kim Green was thorough in his explanations of additional packages/options, but did not apply undue pressure (as you so often encounter at car dealerships) to add to my car purchase.  I have been a walking MINI ad for almost a decade and will continue to support not only the brand, but also Moritz MINI as a world-class, family friendly, and genuinely thoughtful dealership!  Congratulations Samantha and Moritz MINI - well done!",4.8

I decided those were not deal-breakers, though.  We dealt with Timothy through this whole process, and he was very helpful and friendly even though I probably called him every day.

533,"June 27, 2012","I live in Minneapolis and arranged to buy an M3 from a private party in Dallas.  I paid this dealership $335 to do a ""pre-purchase inspection"".  They told me that the M3 came with a mechanic spring-loaded drive belt tensioner that should be replaced with a revised hydraulic tensioner.  I also specifically asked them to check the operation of the manual transmission, especially the syncros.

After driving it back to MN, I learned that the M3 came with a hydraulic tensioner and does not need a replacement.  The handling on the M3 was a little unpredictable, so I had it checked out.  It turns out that the front strut tower bar is missing!  This goes across the top of the engine - how does a mechanic miss that in a comprehensive inspection???  Finally, it's hard to get into 2nd gear and I'm told that the transmission might need repairs.

After learning of this, I left 4 voice mail messages with ""Marcus"", my original service adviser.  His outgoing voice mail was updated daily, so he was working, but he never returned my calls.  I then went to Pachis, the Service Manager.  He offered to ship me an OEM strut tower brace within 2 days.  It took 3 weeks of hounding Pachis, plus escalation to the General Manager before I finally got my strut tower brace.

545,"June 12, 2012","I recently purchased a 1 series coupe from Moritz and could not have asked for a better experience or better service. 

James Cuervas helped me initially and was patient, friendly & concerned with finding the perfect car for me and my needs.  Since he was going to be out when I wanted to purchase a car, he generously offered to share my information with John Brunson.

When I returned to Moritz, John greeted me warmly and let me test drive the car I was interested in right away.  John was committed to helping me purchase the car and was dedicated to doing everything he could to get me a good financing rate, trade in value and a great car.  After having experience at other dealerships with aggressive salesmen, I was pleased with how nice and understanding John was throughout the entire process.  Part of purchasing a BMW involves going to that same dealerhsip for maintenance, and I knew by dealing with John and how great he was at his job that I was making a good choice by purchasing my BMW from Moritz.  

Overall, I honestly could not have asked for a better car buying experience than the one I received at Moritz from John & James.  They both understood what I was looking for and worked hard to make sure I walked away with the BMW I wanted.

If all the service personnel is as accomodating and nice as John & James, Moritz is a great place to purchase a BMW and for service.",5.0

551,"June 05, 2012","I am a loyal BMW customer since 1984 (I still own my original vehicle).  This is my fifth BMW purchase.  I have lived in several states across the United States due to my military and corporate employment. To be frank, I had become very dissatisfied with the service I was receiving from the BMW dealerships in Dallas and as a result, considered leaving the BMW brand. As you know, owning a BMW requires a great deal of preventive maintenance. If the service experience is unpleasant then why buy the vehicle.  In fact, I visited the Moritz dealership as a final effort to see if the BMW service and respect for its customers was truly gone.

Moritz salesman, John Brunson, renewed my belief in the BMW brand.  He was knowledgeable about the car and treated me as a valued customer.  He patiently listened to my requirements and showed me a number of cars that met my needs.  His knowledge of the vehicle demonstrated to me that he not only understood the product but had an appreciation for the workmanship and engineering that went into building the vehicle. His professionalism and zeal for the product convinced me to buy on the spot with no price haggling. This is the first time I have ever bought a car without negotiating on the price significantly.  This speaks volumes for John's ability to put the customer at ease. So kudos to John Brunson, he definitely stopped me from leaving the BMW brand.

I also must add that the presentation of the BMW vehicles at Moritz is impeccable. Most of the cars were displayed under an awning and that enhanced the experience when viewing the vehicles. It provided relief from the sun and allowed me more time to view the vehicle's features. I had my 13 year old daughter with me and she stated and I quote, ""Dad, the cars are clean and beautiful...they are lined up like candy in a candy store "".  At the other dealerships that I visited around town, the cars were hidden in a parking garage or displayed on a lot with very little cover. As you may know, walking a large parking lot in the Texas sun can be brutal during the summer months.

Finally, Ken Moore, business manager, was also very professional and personable.  Usually the final paperwork of buying the car is dry and uncomfortable. That was not the case with Ken. Ken and I had a pleasant exchange during the financial process. He put me at ease and before I knew it I was done with the financial process and was driving off in my vehicle.  

Thanks Moritz for a very pleasant buying experience.  I will definitely recommend you to my friends and colleagues.

553,"May 28, 2012","I had decided upon a specific MiniCooper coupe and talked to them by phone, had it ordered and showed up to get it when it was ready. I did not haggle over the price so I cannot speak to the willingness to ""deal"" but I was able to get the car very quickly. It would have been even quicker (and to me better) if I hadn't had to listen to the spiel about the extended warranties and so forth that seem to be mandated by the owners and thus, must be given, regardless. Still, that was painless enough and was good experience for my son who accompanied me to see the clever tactics and so forth so that he will be able to manage that when his car buying experiences start. The car was in perfect shape and Marco did a swell job taking me through the whole experience. I'll certainly look to Moritz first if I am in the market for a car sold there but not in my home town of Amarillo.

This is our first BMW product, specifically MiniCooper, and we are impressed by the quality of features and workmanship on the car, as well as the quality of people working for Moritz.  I can't stop telling people about how nice our experience was and how great this car is! 
From the looking stage through the final sale, I never had to wait around,  and I had the definite feeling the customer came first.  They stayed open late to accommodate our questions, and walk me through the car's features.  
I will keep buying cars there.   The whole thing was great.

I have now purchased my 4th vehicle from this dealership since 2006 this evening (04/19/12). I purchased a Mini Cooper S in 2006, a BMW 328I in 2008 (purchased from Dextral Harris - he was incredibly competent and helpful during the purchase of my BMW), a Cadillac SRX in 2011 (purchased from Gary Pulliam - incredibly helpful and made sure i was satisfied with my new vehicle) and this evening a new Mini Cooper S. I must say that I have never met a more caring, competent bunch of people in any other dealership. Your team of sales and service personnel exemplify the word service, before, during and after the sale! These guys are amazing... Gary Pulliam has gone above and beyond to help place me in whatever vehicle I want, (and considering I tend to change my mind quite often, that is no easy task). He is always willing to take my phone calls to explain and address any questions/concerns that I may have regarding my new car. I also had the pleasure of dealing with and getting to know Samantha Miller in Mini and was very impressed with her caring attitude as well and knowledge of the vehicle I was purchasing... She was extremely pleasant, competent and concerned with my being pleased with the vehicle I purchased. The dealership is very fortunate to have these people on their staff!

589,"April 19, 2012","I recently had my car totaled and was dreading looking for something else.  With my limited time and crazy retail schedule, this was not something that I wanted to do on my only day (yes, one day off a week) off.  

Calling Candess was the best I call I made.  Yes, I loved my previous car.  Just a few payments away from being paid off, mother nature had other plans.  I let her know from the beginning what I was going thru and what I was looking for.  Suggestion: be specific in what you want.  She gets the job done with great detail.

Candess searched the entire Moritz inventory and showed me what was available.  Honestly, not much since I'm very specific on my needs for a vehicle.  She was patient and fun to work with.  Not ""used car salesman""ish at all.  Candess really gets to know the person for who they are and makes everything smooth.

After picking out the car of my dreams for me, she left me in the hands of Mr. Douglass Mayberry.  What a treat to work with as well!  Calm, relaxed and full of information about the product.  He took the time to show me every detail on the vehicle and was genuinely excited about it.  He also made the transition to finance (with Tony) smooth and quick.  It was painless and they really worked with my budget and specifications being a ""first time on my own adult car buyer"".  ;)

Big thanks to all I met during my experience, especially Jon Underwood for giving me the deal of a lifetime on my BMW.  Just a beautiful car, excellent machinery and a wonderful piece of art.

When I went in, John was very low key (vs. high pressure sales) and spent quite a lot of time with me on the different models I was interested in test driving.

Once I decided on a model, I found John's initial price offer for the car within $30 of the lowest price I'd gotten using TrueCar.com (and I hadn't mentioned that to John first).  This was a purchase not a lease, so I then worked with their finance guy.  Since I'd already set up a loan with Bank of America, they suprised me (pleasantly) with the news that Moritz was a ""Preferred"" dealer with BofA, so they could lower the loan rate by 0.5%.

He then tells me that what he would do is buy one tire and I could buy the others.He looks me in the face as I am standing there crying and says ""Are you happy with that?

Also, they would not honor the extended warranty that we purchased for tire protection. It was purchased from the Moritz Dealership. The protection ran out a little less than a year from the time we purchased it (due to the amount of tire tread still on the tires - this was not explained to us when we purchased it - wy would we purchase protection for tires that would last less than 10K miles????). What a scam. We paid $800 for the ""tire protection plan"" when we purchased the CPO BMW and it got us absolutely nothing...when I brought in a tire with a nail in it they said the tire was too worn to be covered by the ""protection plan.""

I think that Moritz should have looked into this issue further and not just passed the buck or the charge to me.  In the end I was basically told not to use the cupholders.

660,"April 15, 2011","As far as service goes, Mortiz is by far the best I've dealt with. My BMW X5 35d on the other hand is another story. This is my third BMW vehicle and my most disappointing. 

The main facts are: 

The engine threw a rod (faulty piston rod cap bolt) at 13,242 miles but this dealer gave me a loaner and the car was repaired in 32 days - with a new engine from Austria (I think that's where the engines are made). Some people said I was crazy for waiting, and maybe so, but I REALLY liked the vehicle - until now. 

The latest disappointment was a faulty battery. It would appear this is a minor incident but there is quite a bit more to the story. According to BMW: The BMW X5 35ds (and maybe all X5s) are designed to be driven at highway speeds and over 20 km (12.4 miles) the majority of the time one operates the vehicle. This gives the car time to engage the alternator enough to recharge the battery. I drive primarily in the city and under 5 km - 61% of the time. The other 39% of the time is at highway speeds and ""proper"" (BMW recommended) driving distances. The fact that 61% of my driving is in the city, is considered ""Unfavorable Driving Conditions"" - according to BMW. Therefore BMW is NOT responsible for failures under these conditions. Or in other words, it's NOT covered in BMWs maintenance program. Unfortunately, my job requires city driving and short distances between starts/stops. 

BMW NA initially refused to cover the battery failure under their warranty program. I disagreed and Moritz argued my case with BMW NA. BMW NA ultimately agreed to pay for a new $600 (yes $600) battery but only if I paid $80 for a battery charger and charged the battery three times a week.  

So... now my two year old... $60,000+... 2009 BMW X5 35d... sits in my garage with the hood up... charging... three nights a week! It's reminiscent of my first car, a 1974 Plymouth Fury II - which was also black on black. I used to have to charge or jump that car often. The car was old, had a bad alternator and I was a teenager and couldn't afford to buy a replacement right away. So... I charged the battery or used jumper cables to get going. It would appear I've come full circle. 

All-in-all, I highly recommend the dealership, I DO NOT recommend the vehicle. ",5.0

I ended up getting a Value package 2011 BMW 328i lease with Nav and more, in black on black and could not be enjoying it more. Robb Lleyd, the BMW Finance manager pulled some strings to help fit me into a lease figure that included the Road Hazard protection for my wheels and tires that I desperately need (my girlfriend has a habit of ATM curbing) just in case.

I’d like to express my sincere appreciation to several of Moritz’s employees for their assistance:  Chris Ninos, Rick Beers and Kim Green.  The three professionals worked together flawlessly to make our purchase of the 2008 BMW 328i convertible as painless as possible.

The purchase documents had to be express mailed to/from Florida.  
 
Everyone from Moritz was extremely pleasant and responsive throughout the transaction.
 
I am also very appreciative that Moritz was 100% upfront with pricing and dealer fees; I have recently encountered other dealers that attempted to add “junk” fees to the purchase price.

667,"May 02, 2010","On June 3, 2009 I purchased a ""Certified Pre-Owned"" BMW 325 from Moritz. I usually never purchase used cars as I dont want someone else problems. However, I was assured BMW ONLY certifies the best of the best and Moritz is a stew above that. So I went ahead with the deal. A few months later I went to refinance the car at my credit union. Upon inspection of the car they advised me the car had been in an accident. I went back to Moritz to complain that I was sold a car that should not have been certified and the car was misrepresented. I was assured again my Chris Ninos the manager the car only had ""minor cosmetic"" damage to the bumper, and the damage was not that extensive. Still I was unhappy, as I was told when I bought the car that BMW will not certify a car that had been in an accident.  Some how Moritz bribed Car Fax to take the accident off the record because it still does not show up on the history of the vehicle. Since the deal was a few months old at this point, I was stuck. But Chris gave me the extended service program as a means to help compensate me. Again Chris assured me the damage was minor cosmetic damage to the bumper and they had to ""paint and blend"" the back of the car.

Now here we are in May 2010, almost a year later. I have relocated to Los Angeles for my work, and the car is too small to fit my current needs. Last week I attempted to trade in the car, and the dealer appraising my 06 BMW said that this car had MAJOR BODY DAMAGE AS WELL AS EXTENSIVE FRAME DAMAGE.

When I arrived at the dealership, the service advisor, Richard Fincher, who scheduled my appt was gone for the day and another guy checked me in. I mentioned that I had already had quite a few warranty issues replaced (engine sensors) but the same dash lights were still coming on. Upon asking if I needed to bring my invoices in to show where I had already had those parts replaced, I was told, not to worry about it as they could look everything up in a database. Instead of a loaner, I was taken to Enterprise for a GM rental; when I asked about the loaner, I was told that those are reserved only for customers who actually purchased their dealership's cars. After being told that my car would be ready early afternoon, Richard didn't bother to call me...I had to call him and finally, 45min before the service dept closed, I was notified that my car was ready, all of the issues were taken care of and that I owed my deductible on the same list of parts that had been replaced within the last 6months. When I tried to explain that everything should have been under parts warranty, Richard became quite condesending and said that there wasn't any way that what I was claiming was true; I told him that he should be able to see it in their database, his response was that there were ""too many codes"" for him to figure out, however if I faxed over all of my prior invoices, then they would refund my payment. When I showed up to pick up my car the next day, I had to explicitly outline on all prior invoices where the same work had been done. When I finally was given the keys to my car, I went to start it and the battery barely turned over-did the dealership bother to tell me that I had a battery problem-not at all.
