1,"January 23, 2019",We have owned Lincoln’s and with the purchase comes a guarantee of a loaner. The service agent did not make sure i had access to.a loaner. I was without transportation for 2 days and had to call around to get transportation to work and home. My job involves some travel around town and it was very difficult without a car. one reason for purchasing a Lincoln was for these types of perks and the service you typically get with ownership. Those perks do not happen at this service center. ,2.4
2,"January 23, 2019","Once vehicle was assessed, they were very prompt in ordering part and on delivering loaner whole repairs were occurring.  Jesse was good about communicating progress.

Very helpful and answered all questions.  We would most certainly  use Mac Haik again.
 On down side I do not remember  name of sales manager that talked to us also but he was pushy about us making a commitment right then and almost caused us to take our business else where.

First time ordered, they never called.  Same thing the second time.  After a month I had to go up there face to face to remind them we were waiting on the replacement.

64,"December 24, 2018","I came in to Mac Haik Ford after visiting a competing dealership who decided not to work with me. Within minutes Fritz was able to figure out what I was looking for and track down similar vehicles in stock. He worked with me to find the vehicle and work within my budget and to get financing that made sense and was what I was looking for. Because the vehicle was a dealer loaner he worked for me to make sure that the damage to the truck bed and tailgate cap were taken care of as part of the negotiations. I will soon be setting up an appointment to have them taken care of. Mac Haik gives every new Owner a free oil change, but since this vehicle had some miles on it and needed an oil change Fritz made sure that the oil got changed without using the one free oil change. I would suggest you give Mac Haik a try.",4.8
65,"December 22, 2018","I needed a car asap. I went in thinking I wasn't going to be able go purchase a car, at least not one with an affordable payment. Everyone was so friendly and Kenyon worked with me and really got me an amazing deal. The car is perfect for me and my daughter and has such a low monthly payment. I told him what I needed and he gave me exactly that. If this was a place I could go into regularly to receive such excellent customer service every time,  I would be in there every day. However I'm sure I'll have this car for a while so fortunately/ unfortunately I wont have to. I am so grateful for Kenyon and Mac Haik. ",5.0

69,"December 20, 2018","Had a great experience with my oil & all the other services I had done to my truck! Instead of just telling me what else needed to be done or replaced, they showed me.

70,"December 19, 2018",I went to Mac Haik because its reviews and ratings online. Figured id give it a chance. I received everything i was looking for information wise. Great service. Fritz Boedeker helped get my truck insured and registered all in one day and made it happen even by staying later than he had to. Great salesman. He made my day by doing that. I love my truck. Love the service. The customer care reps were great and I'm a happy 2019 F-150 owner. I recommend Mac Haik Ford to anyone wanting a ford vehicle.

84,"December 12, 2018","Our appointment was on a  Monday morning, 8:45am. Service center was very busy. We were checked in, problem diagnosed, given an estimate on the time to complete. A loaner was arranged by Mrs. Mapes. Work was completed on time, actually a bit sooner than expected. Return of the loaner, and pickup of our car was quick and easy, with a smile. ",5.0

86,"December 11, 2018","My initial contact in service was Greg.  My first impression was his friendly attitude.  He was customer oriented, answered my questions, scheduled the recall service for my truck and had it ready to pick up when I arrived.  Overall, a great service experience.
I would like to add that I have had similar experiences with Jessie Mapes.  Both employees are assets to Mac Haik.",5.0
87,"December 11, 2018"," The only way my experience could have been worse is if my car had not gotten repaired. I was told the the backlog for diagnostics and repair was 3-5 days and that there were no loaner cars available, therefore I had to pay to rent a vehicle since I drive 40 miles one way to work every day. On day six my car still had not even been looked at but at least a loaner car had become available. It took them THREE WEEKS to finally look at my car and only two more days to get the parts and repair it. It just seems to me having a vehicle nearly three and a half weeks is a bit extreme for a two day repair. I could not have afforded a rental car for three weeks, most people can not. I will be hard pressed to ever say anything good about the Mac Haik service department and most likely will take future warranty repairs to a dealership out of town. ",3.2
88,"December 10, 2018","The alternator and battery quit on me, needed tepair. I am from Maine and wanted the job done correctly so I came to the dealer. I was given a number for a tow service and that man showed up on time and towed my truck. I was notified by the dealership when it arrived.",4.8

91,"December 07, 2018","Im happy with the service rep (Greg gets 5 STARS) that handle my service complaint. He was very honest with me and my options.  Im disappointed in the technicians because they were unable to tell me what was wrong with my vehicle. I have a hybrid vehicle which requires it being brought to the dealership. I've brought it in for the same problem 4 times. The first time I paid $2400. For diagnosing and fixing what I thought was the problem. The codes they recieved from that diagnostic were not written down. So after picking it up the same day I had to it have
 It towed back to Ford because supposedly they needed to reset a sensor. I've taking it back twice since then, only to be told they couldn't duplicate the problem but yet its still shutting off and showing the same warning light. I was told this last time I needed to replace the transmission which I don't understand why it didn't show the first time.  Leading me to believe the first repair was unnecessary or a guess. I don't trust that they know what their doing and it sounds like a guessing game since no documentation of codes were kept from the first visit.  Therefore I'm taking it to a ford dealership in Houston for further evaluation. Im now being forced not only to take somewhere else but buy another car because i travel alot for work. Not only couldn't I trust the diagnostic but no loaner was available to allow me to continue to have transportation to work. So because of that I do not feel comfortable using Ford service again nor recommending anyone else.. ",2.6

93,"December 06, 2018",The Lincoln service lady wasn’t very helpful and showed frustration at communicating and helping. I had to pay for one day of the rental while waiting for the recalled airbag to be changed. I told her that I didn’t  think I had to pay for that. The next day I got a letter from Lincoln about having 7 days from notice to turn in my rental. She gave me 2 days and was charged for the 3rd. I was out of town when notified that parts were in. I took my car on Tuesday and told the service lady that I didn’t have a vehicle to please let me know if it was going to Be done that same day or I had to find another vehicle since I had already turned in the rental per her instructions. i was not notified that my car wasn’t ready. I called at the end of the day to ask about my car. I asked for a loaner vehicle to go home and work the next day. She said she couldn’t help me. I had to demand one by telling her that I didn’t have a vehicle at all. She had to find one for me or find a way to get me home. She finally did and showed frustration when I picked it up and returned the next day. It was just a bad experience over all. I had to wait almost 7 months for parts to be in and then go through this at the end? It was very upsetting. Plus my car was dirty from the mechanics. So careless. ,2.6

97,"December 05, 2018",Took two weeks to get car looked at.  When it finally went into shop it was a day I had to be at a doctors office.  Dolores the service rep said she would get me a ride to the office.  I needed a ride at 1:30 started calling at 10:30 and at 1:45 after 4 unanswered or no returned calls later I started to walk to dr office.  She returned call at 4 pm to inform me my car had not been looked at and probably would not be looked at till next day.  When I questioned if tires looked at she always said yes and if she didn’t have an immediate response I was put on hold and she came back with a very rehearsed answer.

114,"November 27, 2018","It took a three attempts to get my tire fixed at this location. I had road hazard and they plugged two hole (one trip) and the second on another trip. Each time a left within hours my tire was low again. On the third trip they finally told me it was a valve stem and it wasn’t covered by road hazard so this little piece of rubber cost me $68 bucks and hours of MY time running back and forth to this service station because I trusted they would take care of this tire the first time. I was proved wrong. 

In a previous service call a year or so again I had a oil drain plug stripped out. On another occasion I had my lug nuts in so tight that when I went to buy tires at Sams they couldn’t take them off. I came back to this station and bought tires there as a result. I’m done at this point using this facility. I’ve had to double back and loss MY time too many times.

It was replace the next day - $422 end of story. A month later, while in San Antonio, it started doing the exact same thing and I finally got it home a week later. I took the car back to Quicklane  and was told to leave it and someone would call. That was on Friday 09, 2018. I didn't hear anything so I called on Monday 12, 2018 to check.

After no feedback I called on Thursday 15, 2018 and still no information available and Alfred would check with the mechanic - No Call - No Status - No Information on my car.
I decided to go and speak to someone myself. I spoke to Dolores Lira on the same day and she tried to get information from Alfred but I wasn't able to get information, a status or an update.
Finally on Tuesday 20, 2018, after no information of my car I went to talk to Dolores. She made some calls and was told she was now in charge of my service request. She told me she would follow up and let me know what the current status was. She implied my car could possibly get moved up the list and be diagnosed on Wednesday 21, 2018, but because of the holiday would get in for repairs until Monday 26, 2018. I specifically asked her on , Wed 21, 2018, to me know if the car had still not been analyzed or diagnosed to let me know because I wanted to take my car home. I didn't want it repaired. It was already 2 weeks and nobody even knew where the car was. Dolores called me later and told me the car had been analyzed and that the problem was a bad HCU and the cost was $2700.

146,"November 12, 2018","I own a 2016 Ford F-150 bought brand new in October 2016.  I was leaving for work one morning last week, and when I tried to start my pickup, I first only had clicking sounds as if the starter or battery was bad, but then it finally turned over and allowed me to drive it to Mac Haik's service center.  I told the service manager about my issues, and was told to take it to Mac Haik's Quick Lane service to have the battery tested.  I left my pickup there as they couldn't get to it right away.  I received a call a couple of hours later and was told the battery was charging fine and everything checked out okay.  I was skeptical considering I had not left any lights or other battery-draining features on, so naturally I wondered why my battery would go almost dead as it had.  When I picked up my vehicle, I noticed immediately that the starter was dragging when I started it.  I went back into the Quick Lane counter and told them I was certain something wasn't right.  The young lady working in the place told me everything checked out okay and it should  be fine, much to my disappointment.  I drove the truck home and noticed the next day it was dragging even worse.  I took it to Interstate battery and was told my battery was bad.  So, I replaced it and I'm sure it cost me more because the old battery most likely had some years left on it for which I would have received credit.  Again, just extremely disappointed that something as simple as a battery check couldn't be performed properly, especially after I told them the starter was still dragging.",2.2

198,"October 12, 2018","I came in for an oil change, to get my blinker looked at, and to have an issue with my cruise control addressed.  

I was told I would have to contact another area for my cruise control issue.  Which I did and spoke to Jessie Mapes.  I was told they were too busy to schedule appointments and that I would have be able to drop my car off and leave it potentially for a few days.  1) If you are that busy appointments seem helpful not hurtful. 2) Who can live without their car for a ""few"" days especially if its just sitting in a queue and hasnt even been looked at? 3) Being that busy makes me worry about the quality of product being distributed and work being done. 

The oil change went quickly; however, I sat there for a long while watching my car just sit in a bay.  I am supposing this is the amount of time it took to get the blinker replacement located?  I wasnt told.  I also wasnt told if both my driver side blinkers had been replaced or just one or which one front or back.

When I arrived the passenger seat was done right but the driver seat the seat belt was inside the panel there was no way to putting seatbelt on and everyone was gone. I had to remove panel and pull the seatbelt out. Clearly who ever did the work did not put seatbelt on or else he would have know that seat belt was retracted into panel. Another thing from that experience they left radio turn up loud and more miles on my car they I figured they would have need to put on it.  The second time I had my car serviced was for a/c issue blower was making loud noise after a whole day of they came to conclusion that they need to reprogram the a/c system. When I got my car back it sounded a lil better but only till I left and it started again  so I just replaced blower myself and that was the end of that issue. This last time I tryed to get my car service for something else I was told that they don’t make appointments that I would have to leave my car and they would get to it when they could like a whole week later.

After three hours the paperwork was done, a sales person approached me and said he needed my social security number in order to have the title transfered into my name.

for the truck I was anout to leave and I asked for the keys, they gave me only one.

322,"August 21, 2018","I took my truck in on 8/9/18 at 7:30 AM as directed by service center and they did not get to it that date so I picked the truck up after 5pm. I took the truck back in on 8/10/18 per service center and when I called at 3:30 to see if the truck was ready I was told the problem was found but parts had to be ordered and truck would be repaired 8/21/18 and I would be contacted 8/20/18 to be advised what time to bring the truck in. I called 8/21 to see what the status was and was told I’d be called back. 8/22 I was called back and told what would be replaced and to bring my truck in 8/17. Truck was repaired and returned to me 8/17. The parts that I was told were going to be replaced look as dirty as the rest of the rear suspension so I’m still not sure of what was replaced but the noise is gone.

I had a problem with a porter coming to pick me up 8/9/18 in my truck after moving all my seats, mirrors and radio stations and then having to take him back to Mac haik. Who does that? My personal vehicle is not mac haiks courtesy vehicle and I found it disrespectful to use it as such. The porter didn’t make the decision to do that on his own so I don’t think he should be held accountable for the same. 

I understand timeframes and wait times are dynamic but you could have better communication between the customer and service center and should not have a customer have their personal vehicle used to pick them up and then have to drive your employee back to work. ",3.8

426,"May 28, 2018","I brought my Lincoln in on a Monday. It was slow to start. I was told it could not be diagnosed for another three or four days.  I asked for a loaner but was told there was none. One rep told me they had only one, another told me she wasn’t sure how many. I was put on a waiting list for a loaner. I took my car home, hoping that I would make it. On Wednesday I called and it took me five or six times to actually talk to someone other that the receptionist. Finally, I was called and told they had a loaner for me. It was a very nice clean car. When I arrived I was handed the keys but I had to ask where the car was. I was told but was not accompanied to the car. I did a walk around to make sure there were no dents, etc. my car was completed in a timely manner. It was very clean when I retrieved it. The cashier was not there and someone had to be summoned to check me out. Two others were waiting.",2.8

One time, I was told I needed to look at new tires, when my tires were not even 3 months old! This time, like every time, I was told I needed a new air filter, so I agreed , my $43 oil change turned into $98 , there is no way a 2 minute filter change was $20 worth of labor. I understand the filter would be higher there than auto zone, I was expecting $18-$20 higher bill but come on! Really! I will not be going back and will let everybody know how I was over charged and IF they go it better be straight oil change and run out the door! Very disappointed ",1.8

439,"May 23, 2018","Let me begin by saying I'm including parts of my sales experience in this review. I purchased my car on a freezing day so I was not able to get my new car detailed and washed. Also when we purchased the car the interior lights would continuously blink when I applied the brakes and the sales person recommended to bring it in when I got it serviced and he would personally make sure to get it all taken care of for me. Did as he suggested and to my surprise the sale person is no longer with company. So attempting to get my vehicle serviced for an issue that I had since I purchased the vehicle was an absolute nightmare. ""Take it here"" ... ""take it there""... ""you will have to talk to a sales manager"". I felt like the sale was made and I was being passed to every person within the dealership instead of just being taken care of. My sales experience was poor ...getting my car taken care of for a KNOWN ISSUE for the model vehicle I purchased would take 2-3 days is inconvenient. Ultimately I walked away purchasing a vehicle that was not cleaned when I left the car lot and with an issue I've had since day 1 and had to pay to get repaired at a different dealership. The service person did her best in directing me what to do just so unsatisfied with the time frame to get interior light bulbs replaced. ",1.0

444,"May 19, 2018","I test drove a Ford F-150 a few weeks ago as part of my search for a new truck.  I spoke to David Loa, whom I have known for over 20 years, and he patiently showed me the different options available.  I stopped in after work on a Saturday and David and I got serious about purchasing the vehicle.  David and Tariq Lopez worked with me and were very straightforward and honest in their efforts to make sure I got all of the incentives I qualified for and was satisfied with the truck and the financing.  Overall, it was the smoothest, least stressful truck purchase I have ever made.  Both gentlemen are true professionals and I have highly recommended both to friends and family.  ",5.0
