0,"January 28, 2019","Took vehicle in for new transmission ($5000) and the vehicle came out with a totally new problem. The strut was damaged and popping real bad. I took it back and they blamed an old dent on oil pan, which made no since. They refused to take any blame for it even though they know ot wasn't a problem before. So i am out another $500 after buying 2 cars from them in the last 4 years and a $5000 transmission job. Needless to say I'm never going back!

1,"October 28, 2018","My husband and I just bought a Titan XD truck from Jaime Garcia, and we found him to be extremely competent and personable.  He gave us time to do what homework we felt necessary before making a decision, while still giving us all information we required.   He has an easy-going personality and we did not feel pressured at all, which is our style.  He called us with a sales price and payment amount, and that it what we paid without having to go through all the back-and-forth that has made vehicle buying such torture in the past.  We really enjoyed doing business with Jaime, and we will call him when we or our family and  friends are in the market for a vehicle.

3,"September 05, 2018","I was greeted as soon as I pulled up to the garage. The gentleman asked what I needed and it was a simple oil change. They offered me a complimentary car wash but refused since it was going to rain. As I entered the waiting room I was offered complimentary water, coffee and snacks. I was very appreciative. Then Paul Wilson joined me and gave me some tips and offers as far as keeping my truck running smoothly as well as the special buy 3 get 1 free for tires which I hopefully plan to take part in. He's helped me previous times before and is always nice and very efficient. As I left I teased the staff that hopefully Ed Hicks is paying you guys time and a half for Labor Day.",4.6

I dropped my daughter off at home and returned to the service center to have it checked out.  They tightened the lug nuts on all four tires and said it was the left rear tire was loose.  I paid for this service in advance and I get me and my daughter put in harm's way . I have all three vehicles serviced at the same service center.

59,"August 14, 2018",This is the 2nd time I take my car in and the problem can be duplicated. This time there was a clicking noise to the drivers front tire when reversing and when I go forward to straighten the wheel there was a clicking sound. I dropped it off at 8:30am  called at 2:30pm for an update and was told car was just taking out for test drive. Got a call A little after 5pm that they couldn't hear any noise but offered I could go back because it was close to 6 to ride with tech to show him what I was hearing . Car also had a oil change and tire rotation. As soon as I drove off noise was still there and now on passanger front. Also noticed a little nick of paint off by the gas tank. I am very busy mother school is going to start. I have kids in all kinds of sports and I am up and  down all the time that I rarely have time to go take my car back. I got no update on my car. I had to call and didn't get a diagnosis until after 5pm. If my car wasn't ready I was going to need a rental. Now I have to Try to find another chance to drop it off and that Is extremely difficult. Joseph was really nice though. He always is.  ,3.5
60,"August 14, 2018",Went in on a Saturday and sat2 hours for a oil change watching my car sit there inside the bay for a hour with the hood up. They didn’t do the usual maintenance check.

76,"August 07, 2018"," I have  purchased 4 cars from Ed HIcks. Let me tell you why I will never recommend, purchase or do anything else at that dealership besides the maintenance contract I paid for my altima. 

In may took the 14 versa in for warranty work on a/c. they bring the vehicle out when done and the front bumper is hanging off of it. brought to there attention immediately and they where like OOHH. they took it to the back and reattached it. 10 miles after we left and the dealership was closed the anti lock brake light comes on and there is an intermittent vibration in the front end .. my stepson went home to kingsville with it.. he works 7 12's for a dictator roofing company. he finally got time today and took it in... they tell him he hit something that shifted the front bumper and bent the axle and will be $1000.00 to repair. hhhmmm and amazingly the same service person denied that they took the vehicle to the back to reattach the bumper... i am an advanced accident re constructionist and i examined the damage. 30 law enforcement experience and it appears to me that the damage was not from striking an object other than maybe a vehicle lift when they changed the compressor. Im not stupid and this is not going to be ignored. .

But they didn’t even mention it. When I confronted them about it, I was then told they couldn’t fix it and I needed to buy a new tire.  Took my car down the road and got the tire fixed for $15.  This isn’t the first time that they have told me I need to spend a ton of money to get something completely replaced when I was able to get it fixed for WAY less.

104,"July 28, 2018","This is the first time I’ve had to leave my Frontier for a lengthy service. I usually get everything done at the quick lube but the services I needed done were only performed in the service bays. I had an 8 am appointment to drop of my truck. I arrived at 7:45am and my service ticket was opened at 7:50 am.  Services i had done: transmission fluid change, front and rear differential fluid change, fuel system service, coolant flush and transfer case service. The service advisor asked what time I would like to pick up my vehicle and I told him I had to work so the afternoon sometime would be fine, in which he assured me it would be done by then. Called the service department at 1 pm and left a message. Got a return call around 2 pm stating that it was in the service bay and shouldn’t take too long. When I arrived at the dealership at 3:45 pm, the service advisor told me he spoke with the technicians and it would be about an hour. Ok, cool, no problem. At around 5:30 pm, I ran into the service manager outside in which I let him know what was going on. He told me the first 4 services I mentioned were 1 hour jobs. I didn’t mention that when I arrived and was watching my vehicle service being done, that I saw at least 3 of the services get done at the same time, roughly taking 1 hour total. The service manager let me know that he was going to cut me a break on the labor costs after I mentioned that I was about to pay $900 just for fluid changes and that I had to come back for another oil change, power steering flush, brake fluid flush and balance and roatate on the tires. My service ticket was closed at 5:50pm, exactly 10 hours. Everyone at the dealership has been great and the employees at the quick lube are awesome, but I was highly unimpressed with the service department. ",2.4

135,"July 11, 2018",I personally do not recommend any nissan express service ever. I could clearly hear my tires screeching when the kid took my truck to the car wash and when he gave it to me my antenna was broken. I give nissan credit for how quickly they took care of the problem and to be completely honest it has nothing to do with the nissan dealership at all. It has to do with that employee that clearly just wanted to get done at any costs. Thanks to him my new antenna is still crooked because the antenna mount is at an angle. And he also left his muddy footprints and jacked around with my stuff inside. Im not sure if my stuff was all messed up because he was driving crazy or messing with it but still made me feel slightly violated when i could clearly see my stuff has been messed with.

421,"March 29, 2018","I was scammed from the beginning concerning the price and once that was satisfied turns out the vehicle I purchased has many issues. As a single mom without much money, Ed Hicks was recommended to me. I was lead to believe they would work with me on the price since I wanted to pay cash but when I arrived I was told that was just to get me there. The price was almost $3K over KBB price but got the sales manager to offer a 4 year electrical and engine warranty. After having the car for 2 days it was discovered the trunk would not open and the driver side blinker was not working. After a bunch of back and forth, the service department fixed the trunk and blinker. Unfortunately, the blinker is still not functioning properly now. Then a few days later I found out the solinoids were misfiring. Yes I understand this can happen at anytime however as someone who has not had the vehicle for even 1 month I felt as though it is good business to sell people working vehicles. I was told they would replace one of the solenoids but that was going to be the extent of their kindness. That replacement worked for a moment. Maybe it's just me but I chose Ed Hicks because I did not want to get screwed over. Just my luck thats exactly what has happened. Now I have to replace 3 more solenoids, get the blinker fixed that was already supposed to be done, and the shocks need to be replaced so far. To top it off one of the local competitors expressed to me that as a customer who incurred these issues within 30 days of purchase my car would have been taken care of with no additional costs to me. Hopefully this review will help any other vulnerable people from getting this type of service too. Again there are employees and members of the managment team that were very kind to me but for the overall experience, I dont recommend this dealership!",2.8

501,"November 01, 2017","I bought a Toyota 4runner from them living in a different state. It was a pretty straightforward transaction. I told them to list any defects with the vehicle and they only told me there was minor damage to the rear bumper. So I get the paperwork, and they tacked on extra fees and taxes above the service price. I had to argue with them about that. We got the price lowered, and I paid them my deposit and had my bank send them a check. They were very insistent on knowing the details of the financing, so I told them I would be financing a large portion and coming out of pocket for the remaining. They received the check and started berating me for the money I was coming out of pocket (keep in mind, it was already included in the check.) So they were trying to scam me out of another $1700. I needed to arrange shipping, and figured it would not hurt to have them send me a quote. That came in $300 higher than I was able to get online (THANK YOU uSHIP).  I get the vehicle and it has a mysterious dented door and the interior lights don't work. Additionally, the gas light is on (completely out of gas) and there is no temp tag as they promised. As I had the vehicle delivered to a parking lot, I had to drive it home with no paperwork and HOPE for the best. I complained to them and Leo Garza PROMISED he would make things right for me. He mailed me a gas card ($20 or half a tank) and got me the paperwork. They lose my title information and accidentally mailed it to my bank. I go to the DMV in an attempt to get a temp tag or register it (hour drive, so much for the $20 gift card) and they told me Ed Hicks did not bother filling out the back of the title. I drove back home, again, with no tags. I get the temp tags and start talking to them about the non-working interior lights and dented door. They threw up their hands and said it all had to happen on the back of MY delivery vehicle. The lights HAD to work when it left because they would NEVER sell a vehicle like that. Oh, and the photos of the vehicle before it left did not definitively show the damaged door. So I go digging around. I check the fuses, crawl under the dash and look for loose wires, etc. Nothing. Certainly, it isn't a bulb, right? Yup. Every single interior bulb is missing. I'm sure it fell out on the back of the truck. At this point, they've stopped talking to me. ",1.6

712,"March 11, 2015","I was so impressed with the service that I received at Ed Hicks Nissan.  The sales associate,  the finance manager, and the General Manager all worked together to get me the best deal.  In the last 3 yrs. I have purchased 4 vehicle'ss from Auto Nation. They just did not compare to Ed Hicks.  A SPECIAL THANKS TO DAVE WHITE  (MY SALES PERSON. ",5.0
713,"February 22, 2015","Purchased a 2013 Nissan Versa, the sales consultant Robert Thompson worked with me through the process. A very courteous, professional, not the typical pushy car salesman. Ms. Annie Guzman in the finance department was also very helpful explaining additional maintenance coverages. Great interest rate and terms, vehicle delivered showroom condition by end of the day.
I would recommend Ed Hicks to friends and family. Will return for future purchase!   ",5.0

716,"January 29, 2015","First and foremost the internet representative Ronnie who helped me through basically my entire purchace, made the whole experience so much easier and quicker then if I would have just gone on to the lot! I've purchased two other vehicles from both Ed Hicks.and Ed Hicks prenowned and this was by far my best experience yet! In being in contact with Ronnie, I was able to get my credit application done, know what I qualified for, and narrowed my choices of vehicles down to two, all before even stepping onto the lot! Which with my scheduled saved me so much time in itself! She was very helpful and did her very best to accommodate me and help me to get into the best vehicle for me. She set it up for me to come by and meet with Raymond who could further help me along. Unfortunately he was gone for the day, but they had left word with Robert that I would be coming in and he was ready to help as soon as I arrived.  At that time I knew what vehicle I pretty much wanted, but asked to see a few others. He was very sweet and patient and showed me some other options I might be interested in. He explained features and differences between vehicles. I felt very good about the whole situation and finally made my decision to purchase the Kia! I couldn't be happier with it! Raymond also helped me the next day when I picked up my vehicle and with a few things that needed to be taken care of. I called and texted him several times after my purchases with questions, and he always contacted me back, pretty quickly and resolved my questions. He was very nice and genuinely seemed to care! I couldn't have asked for a better trio to help me on this purchase! They were all very helpful and professional. I'd recommend them to anyone : )",5.0
717,"January 28, 2015","I just purchased a Nissan Sentra for my daughter, who is attending college. I want to say Thank you to Mr. Jaime Garcia for his help with my first purchase. I am very pleased with Ed Hicks. I will definitely be making my next purchase at Ed Hicks. ",5.0
718,"January 22, 2015",I went this past Monday to assist and help my mom buy a new vehicle because my father was in a car accident and totaled my car. My mom hesitated to buy a car because of how long process would take. I went in on Saturday and looked around was approached by a salesman that was rude to me. Being that I am in retail and the way he spoke with me I was turned off. I still went back Monday with my mom and new salesman David White approached me and my experience was outstanding. Needless to say we walked out with a 2014 Nissan Murano 25 miles. If you want a great and pleasant experience ask for David White. 1st time buying a Nissan but I would go back again to have that great experience with David White.,4.8
719,"January 12, 2015","I bought my 2006 Hyundai Accent (56,000 miles) in April of 2014. Now, January 2015, my car is having many problems. Overdrive will not turn on, my car is not getting near the gas mileage as advertised, and my engine is leaking oil. At this point, I missed work to take my car into get serviced. The associate in sales has been semi helpful. When I bought my car I was persuaded into buying a warranty for my car. I hesitated because I assumed my car was still under manufacturer warranty as it was less than 10 years old with less than 100,000 miles. I was then told that it would not be covered under Hyundai warranty and it was best to buy the Ed Hicks warranty. I put my faith in these people and bought the warranty. After taking my car in at 9a.m. this morning (1/12/15), I got a call at 5:30 p.m. saying it would be faster for me to take my car to the Hyundai dealer ship as it was still under warranty with them. That really upsets me because I was told that warranty was not an option, and I spent an additional $2,000 on a warranty from Ed Hicks. Basically, I feel like I was tricked into buying a warranty, and now am being told that it will be hard for me to use the warranty I purchased and easier for me to use the warranty that I was told I did not have. I firmly stated I would not take my car to the Hyundai dealership as I paid for a warranty through Ed Hicks. Hopefully tomorrow I will be given a rental car so I can get back and forth to work. I will be sure to post an update as to the outcome of the situation. So far I am very unhappy, but I am hoping Ed Hicks will prove they are a reputable car dealership. I put my trust and faith in this dealership, and I hope that I can spread the word to others that my experience has been a positive one. ",1.4
720,"December 26, 2014","The person that sold us our new truck,(Jacob) was Reallyyy nice and respectful. But that dealership Atmosphere is so blah, no welcoming. The kids play area need a tv for the kiddos and new toys, crayons etc.  they need to fix that, and make the customers feel welcome , offer them water, etc.  while they wait. Make your customer experience a good one. ",3.6
721,"December 10, 2014",I had an amazing experience with my salesman Frank Rubinos at Ed Hicks Nissan. I am truly blessed to have found him.  He took great care of me and went above and beyond my expectations in helping me look for the perfect vehicle. I send all my friends and family to him! He also took his time in helping me understand how to use the many special functions in my new Altima. I look forward to my next vehicle purchase so I can continue doing business with him :) ,5.0
722,"August 05, 2014","I bought my 2010 Nisssan Altima brand new, it has leather seat and is loaded, the clear coat paint on the hood, roof and the trunk has cracked and the paint on the side trim of the doors are peeling and because it is out of warranty they said to bad and had me call Nissan Customer Service and Affairs and after 2 weeks they called me back to say there is nothing they can do about, very poor quailty of a car and will NEVER buy a Nissan again.  Ed Hicks Nissan in Corpus Christi Texas is a place that i will never recommend to family and friends.
My husband has a Toyota truck and it is 12 years old and the paint job is perfect, that just go to show you that the quaitly paint on Nissan car is very poor all they want is to sell cars and once you have bought the car you are on your own.",1.6

724,"October 24, 2006","sold me a suv, inflated price by 5000, after i signed contract that was just shoved in my face, they had the nerve to call me 3 days later wanting me to sign a new contract for even more money. i did not go back to sign, so ed hicks decided to write up new contract and forge my name on it.   has been turned into police, i am pressing charges, also hired attorney, i am suing. avoid the scam artists at this dealership, at all costs.",1.0
725,"September 17, 2006",I walked out after signing the papers thinking I did okay.  When I got home I went back through the papers that they just fly you through and I was not very happy with the way they move prices around.  I bought a Sentra the MSRP on the window was 14300.  The paperwork had 19800.  So in order for them to cover my negative equity on the vehicle I was trading they gave me the 2400 incentive and took my 1500 down which apparently did not bring the cost of the vehicle down but covered their butts so they would still make money.  Will never buy another nissan from ed hicks.  Talk about Scheisters and shame on me for not looking all the paper work over and understanding it before I signed.,3.6
726,"October 10, 2003","Outstanding ownership, but is co-located with a Nissan dealership. This co-location has made the staff sometimes not aware of the service environment required for a Mercedes customer. This will be changed next year when the Nissan dealership is moved to a different location and the Mercedes store will be upgraded.Have dealt with this dealership for 25 years, both buying and recommending the dealership many times. The outstanding long term ownership has always made the purchase and service of the Mercedes dealership one of the best in Texas.",4.3
