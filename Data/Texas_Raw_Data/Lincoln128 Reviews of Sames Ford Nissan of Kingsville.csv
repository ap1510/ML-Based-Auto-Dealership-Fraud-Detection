0,"July 22, 2019","I am the Proud  Owner  of a Ford Focus 2014. I found out my car had a  Problem with a Module (Tcm)
I Called Sames Kingsville and spoke with a Gentleman by the Name of Frank Monsevais. He was very knowledgeable about how to handle my problem and reassured  me  that  he would take care of  me. Because of Frank  and how he handled,  the situation and walked me through every step of the process.
I was so pleased and will be back because of Frank. He treated me like Family and the staff  was so friendly as well. In this day and age, it is so nice to go to a dealership  like Sames  in Kingsville  and be treated so well.I will be back to purchase  a vehicle  from Sames  because  of the People and the way I way treated.  It was such a Awesome experience  and it started with a Man in your service Dept Frank Monsevais.",5.0
1,"February 15, 2019","Never buy a Rogue SV and add  Leather seats at Sames Ford Kingsville.  Afternoon 7 months it starts break down.  The car bumps keeps bopping out and car doors don’t  open.  The control panel turns black and don’t work.  So I took it in for service and it took them 2 1/2 weeks to fix it and they also scratch my bumper. I’m not happy.  After all this I don’t think I was asking for the world so I asked to get another car same make and model and same price and monthly.  Well Marco said they could do that.  I don’t think it’s was my fault  that the car I got was a lemon , I guess Sames Ford in Kingsvillle are now selling lemons.  ",1.6

Really appreciate it!",5.0
14,"December 17, 2018","Your service center is the only one in all of Kingsville that can fix my truck. The staff is truly professional and kept me informed as to what is going on with my truck. I need to get more work done at the service center but I need more time on the clock. The truck needs new tires, shocks and struts replaced along with a serious alingment. However, being the only one in town Sames Ford is where I will go. ",5.0

21,"November 29, 2018","I brought in my vehicle after I lost power steering. They were able to procure the part and fix the vehicle within 2 days. Customer service itself was good. However I was overcharged for the part, which I found online the next day for a few hundred dollars cheaper, and they way overcharged for labor. Several shops out in town could have done the job for less than half the price in labor. I am unlikely to give ford my business in the future.  I will also recommend to everyone I work with at the base here in Kingsville not use Same's Ford.",3.4

26,"November 26, 2018","I’m pretty sure because I’m a girl I received terrible service and was treated as if I were an idiot. The original price they quoted me was more than the online price. Then they were not willing to budget on the price. Then they called me back to give me a “better price” with a x monthly payment for x months. Which thankfully I can do math, ended up being even more than the instore price (without tax). Just over all poor service. I felt 100% that I was not taken seriously because of my gender. Thankfully I went to Hicks Family and bought the exact same car with the same package and features for $8,000 less than Sames wanted. ",1.0

33,"November 16, 2018","My title says it all. The  service taking customers home and picking up while waiting is awesome. Keep that up! However, I think it’s important to let customers know that even though the store opens at 7am the service doesn’t start until 8am. After that it takes time for the maintenance personnel to setup. It’s a time management thing. Overall the service is commendable ",5.0

It had been over two years since I had my car serviced (I drive about 5 miles in a weeks time and all in the town). So I had Quick Lane service out my car. Their inspection FOUND my problem.

115,"January 18, 2018","Best experience I’ve ever had at a dealership. Our salesman Freddy was very helpful and to the point. He told it like it was and was able to get us the best deal possible. We went in just to look around, not expecting to drive away with a car that day. And thanks to Freddy we walked away with not only one car but two brand new 2018 Nissan Sentras. Would definitely recommend him for anyone looking for a car. He was even nice enough to help me pair my phone to the Bluetooth feature on my car!:)",5.0

Freddy helped us with the financing part and we were done. It was painless and stress free. We couldn't have had a better experience. ",5.0

126,"May 05, 2016","Went in with a particular new car in mind and in a particular color scheme.  Dealer used high pressure sales tactics to get me to accept a car with a different interior and exterior color than I had wanted.  Additionally car had a navigation system and the data card installed was a year out of date.  Overall disappointed and will not buy from the dealer again.

127,"July 20, 2015","We called the dealership about a specific vehicle and asked them to thouroughly scan the vehicle and take pictures of any dents, scratches, tears in leather, etc. So we could make an educated decision about driving 5 hours one way to look at it. They assured us there were no dents or scratches or tears in the leather. Upon arrival, we were extremely dissappointed to find numerous scratches, a couple dings, and a passenger seat that needed to be re-covered, and LOTS of touch up paint. There were also several broken or missing parts within the vehicle. We would have looked past these items if they would have negotiated on the price but they wouldn't come off the price a single dollar. (Even though we were told on the phone prior to making the trip that it was negotiable). So we were lied to, out the expense of fuel and a night at a hotel, and 10+ hours in the car and they would do nothing to make it right. Obviously we did not give them our business and we are truly dissappointed by their lack of integrity.",1.0
