0,"February 13, 2020","I am sad to leave this particular rating. I have many friends at this dealership however, I was appalled that during the finance portion Of the transaction I was charged an interest-rate above what I could’ve been offered. I listened to the finance employee and he explained it was the best there was. The very  next day I discovered that there were several options available to me at a lower rate. I will be refinancing my car in the next week at the better rate. I should have followed my gut and not completed the deal.

I like my car very much.  The finance department was a major disappointment.  ",2.0
1,"September 04, 2019","I would recommend this dealership over any I have been to.  It is worth your time to use them.  Make sure you try this dealership, you will not be disappointed.",5.0
2,"September 04, 2019","This is my 3 vehicle leased or purchased from Michael Raupp and 5th vehicle overall from a Huffines dealership. I keep coming back because I always get treated with respect and kindness. I appreciate being listened to and feeling like they want to get me the car that works best for me and not trying to sell just to sell. Michael especially has been the best salesman I’ve ever worked with and I plan to keep coming back to him! 
Also Ashton was very helpful in finances. He worked his magic to give me and my wife some great coverage packages without increasing the budget too high! Great guys and a great place!

6,"August 29, 2019",We called ahead and made an appointment with William McGraw to trade in a Kia and purchase another.  He took all the time I needed to decide on which model I wanted to buy.  He was very mindful of my limited time schedule and made sure we stayed on it.  This is the third car we have purchased from Will and we are looking forward to trading in our other Kia next year with his assistance.,5.0

16,"August 11, 2019",This dealership and it’s people go the extra mile! They sold my mother a car that she loves and took very good care of her.

I have been buying cars from dealerships for a very long time and this was my one of the best experiences yet.
Joey was the finance person and he has to be the most efficient & polite person in finance I have ever come across.",5.0
22,"August 05, 2019","Although my auto wasn't repaired the first time, I was treated kindly and professionally. Robert Speilman was my service adviser and he did a good job explaining why I needed a new  battery and
why they cleaned the fuel system. This did not fix my issue and did cost me $367, but was probably not a bad idea to have work done. I will review further on upcoming visit. ",4.2

26,"August 03, 2019"," My husband and I purchased two brand new Subaru's on the same day in June/2016.  I experienced an air conditioner problem with my 2016 Legacy.  The AC was blowing hot air which is terrible news if you live in TX.  We took the car to our Subaru dealership in Corinth, TX for review. I was told the compressor was damage and needed to be replace.  Bosko  Zaric , from the service department stepped up, showed his great service  and resolved my issue.  Bosko and the Management team went the extra mile to assist with the repair an honor  the car warranty even though I passed the warranty for a few days.  That was a surprise and that is exceptional appreciation to us as customers.  As always, they put the customer first! Thanks Guys!!   Awesome service. We are very grateful. We cannot wait until our son is 16 to buy him a Subaru as well!.  
Thanks.

27,"August 02, 2019","I had been driving from Frisco to Plano for Subaru purchases/service and was hesitant to work with another dealership because I wasn't familiar with the Corinth area.  As it turns out, the drive wasn't a hassle at all--just go straight down Eldorado--, and the vehicle and buying experience were well worth it.  I'm so glad I made the switch!",5.0

29,"July 30, 2019","We just bought our 2nd 2020 Kia from Huffiness Kia in Corinth, Texas in less than 4 months. We previously were a family of 4 Honda's at a time going back to the early 2000's having owned a total of 9 Honda's, including 6 Accords, 2 Civics and a 1 CRV. All good cars, just boring...  Then we tried a pair of the New 2018 front wheel drive Mercedes.  A CLA 225 4 Dr. Coupe & GLA 250 SUV and after a year and a half were just simply not that impressed for the money. A few years ago I would have laughed in your face if you asked to drive a Kia. Not anymore, these cars are the BOMB! In my opinion Kia has the goods! Our 1st Kia is a 2020 Kia Soul GTI in Neptune Blue like the one on the poster in the  dealership and the 2nd a 2020 Hyper Red Kia Sportage S with Panoramic Sunroof, leather and a trailer hitch to tow our 13' Boston Whaler to and from the lake. Both Kia's are very comfortable to drive and quiet,  you can hear a pin drop inside. Both have a very solid feel and offer way more safety features and creature comforts at a better price than anything else we looked at and get great gas mileage.  Our salesman was William McGraw both times. Alex Wiederholt and Phil Vivar were the Sales Managers that helped seal the deal. On a personal note from my experience Alex Wiederholt has got to be the hardest working Internet Manager in America!  We did not hesitate to work with William the 2nd time after we saw how much better pricing we received at Huffines that the other Fort Worth or Dallas Dealers we shopped! Huffines beat them all. Highly recommend you take the drive up I-35 to their beautiful new dealership and ask for William McGraw.  Quality Kia products at country prices... You will be glad you did. Tell William, Mac D sent you....",5.0
30,"July 30, 2019","Huffines Subaru is a refreshing oasis of honesty, integrity and treating customers with respect.  The people are genuinely interested in educating the consumer without overselling so the the decision to buy, not buy or think about it is not based on emotion or false expectations.  There is a culture of kindness that is truly a rare find these days. Highly recommend it!!!",5.0
31,"July 30, 2019","Made an appointment a week in advance, due to living 4 hours away. When we arrived for are appointment Art the salesman I made the appointment with greeted us and we went straight to business. Loved that they pulled all the car faxes for me to look at and then pulled all the cars out for me to test drive. There was no waiting around or wasting my time. Everyone was so nice and willing to help and get everything done and accomplished in at timely fashion that best suited us. I highly recommend using this dealership!",5.0

38,"July 19, 2019",We have been a loyal customer for the past 20 years.  The recent purchase is our eighth  Forrester.   This vehicle continues to sell itself.  All I have to do is to  decide what color I haven't  previously had!.   Its consistent  road safety record continues to be another major  reason  when considering the purchase of another vehicle.

The waiting area is all that I could ask for - a great work area with WiFi, TV, fully stocked drink bar and snack area.

42,"July 15, 2019","I was told about a misrepresentation on a carfax report. The salesperson was up front to tell me that she couldn't in good conscience recommend that vehicle even if it meant losing my business. She immediately found comparable vehicles down to the package and price. There was no up-selling, only equivalence, meaning she listened to our needs and our boundaries and was concerned about our safety.",4.6
43,"July 13, 2019",Saul was very helpful in showing me everything I needed to know to about the car. Ben was also very helpful getting my financing worked out. This was the first car I have ever purchased completely on my own and everyone there made it a very good experience. ,5.0

It seems Zak has the same amount of experience as I do!  From the get go, Zak was professional, transparent, honest, personable, friendly and above all, shared with us the numbers upfront of what it was cost to get into the vehicle we wanted.  He allowed me to borrow a vehicle early on so I could pick my wife up for lunch to get her onboard with the Outback.

49,"July 08, 2019","I had just visited Huffines KIA in December and had a super experience. John in the service dept had done such a great job that I sent in a glowing review. This experience was nothing short of the same thing. Both Clint & Robert assisted me this time and the experience was fantastic. My Kia Optima broke down on the Hwy coming back to Denton from Ft Worth. I had to have it towed to a local shop in Ft Worth. They told me my Kia needed a new engine ($6500.00). I called the Huffines dealership and they sent a tow truck to Ft Worth to pick up my car and bring it back to them at NO Charge to me. This was the first of good things to come (saving me $ 230.00 in towing). The following day I received a call from Clint that my Kia was covered under warranty due to a recall. I bought this car brand new in 2011 and have 134K miles on it. They provided me a new Kia Optima as a loaner and told me it could take up to 2 months to fix. About 2 1/2 or 3 weeks later, they called and told me my car was ready! Super fast service, kept in touch throughout the process and I couldn't be happier. Great job to the entire team!! and love the new place. Thanks to all.",5.0
50,"July 07, 2019","First of all, my wife is on her second Kia Sportage and they have performed well at a reasonable price and Huffines alway makes it an easy process.  Next the Kia warranty is what convinced us to lease/purchase kia vehicles going forward.  They stand behind their vehicles and, unfortunately, that's a unique trait in the market.  Also, their base to mid models are more well-equipped than other brands, from safety to comfort features.  When it came time to send our daughter off to college, it had to be a Kia.  While there, I got hooked on the Telluride.  We've dealt with several different folks in the sales and finance departments and all have been a pleasure to work with.  When our son starts to drive next year, we'll be back again!",5.0

I didnt know Huffines really had it in them until I came to this dealership, just ask Aaron :) 

This experience overall, including Aaron's Rockstar service and the brief exchange with David, restored my faith in Huffines and has made me an advocate.

Tom Talbot called me first thing in the morning, he was knowledgeable, super friendly and we arranged to meet later that day. I was running a bit late (construction on 121) and when I finally arrived I was directed to Michael Raupp. Mike was able to catch up on what I was looking for and let me know that the vehicle they had wasn't exactly what I was looking for. Mike then started coming up with solutions not trying to sell me something I didn't want. He searched for what I wanted and also let me know that they did have exactly what I was looking for ordered just wouldn't arrive until a later date. We discussed my options and I was very confident that this team would get me what I wanted. Mike asked if I'd like to take a test drive to familiarize myself with the vehicle, that sounded like a great idea. When Mike went to grab the keys for the test drive I saw the car I bought, I just fell in love. When we were test driving the Crosstrek, great vehicle by the way, I couldn't stop thinking about the Outback. Mike suggested I test drive the Outback and I happily agreed. It was absolutely perfect, not what I thought I wanted but, exactly what I really was looking for. Mike and Tom got all the paperwork together, while Mike was working on the new sale Tom was helping get everything taken care of for my trade in and he and Mike worked together to get me 0% interest financing (awesome). I can't express how much I appreciate the team work and camaraderie. The Huffines team made a customer of me, not just a sale. I also want to mention Ashton May in finance, great guy. I can honestly say this was my best ever experience buying a vehicle. I came in ready to argue and fight, I walked out feeling like I had made some new friends.

I actually drove over the day before to the Subaru Dealership in Grapevine and walked around the lot and later in the main building and no one ask if I needed any help so I left and drove back home.
Later back on internet to Cars.com and found, 2018 Subaru WRX Blue in Denton, Texas at Huffines Subaru Dealership.  
Mike Bresnahan was my choice on the list of names, not knowing and was an excellent choice.
Mike spent a lot of time going over the details and asking if their any other needs that he could help me with. I received a phone call from Mike, yesterday after purchasing the Subaru on February 26th asking me if there was anything or questions he could answer to help me with and how well I liked my new vehicle.
I was trully impressed with Mike and all staff that made it happen on the purchasing process at Huffines Subaru.

182,"February 19, 2019","Buying a car and saying farewell to one you've had is usually a stressful experience. Buying a Subaru at Huffines was just the opposite.  Every person who assisted me in the process of purchasing my vehicle was top notch. Mercedes Griffin, Michael Raupp, Anthony Reich and Joey Sparlin all stepped up to make this a dealership that I would return to for future purchases. 

The only suggestion that I would make is likely to be addressed at the new location. The pre-owned sales building was not very appealing and didn't have the comfortable feel or attractive look of the cars Huffines sells. Also, except for the employees I dealt with directly, few other employees made a point to be as friendly and welcoming as I would have expected.

187,"February 14, 2019","Bought a used car from Huffines Kia in Oct ‘17 with around 75,000 miles on it, added the “platinum plus” warranty for powertrain coverage until 100,000 miles. In and out no problems, the buying experience was actually a pleasure compared to any other vehicle we have purchased, as a matter of fact we highly recommended Huffines since that day and never planned to go anywhere else for another car purchase.   As for this car, regular maintenance was done and the car had been running fine since purchased, last check and oil change was only 4 weeks earlier. Wife was driving home Friday and car just loses all power and dies on highway and will not start up regardless of what we try. Checked oil since service was recently done and found oil still looks “clean” and within spec. We get car towed to Huffines KIA and wait all day Monday for any news as to what the issue is, finally around 5 we find out the engine has seized, they cannot provide a reason as to why this happened. We go through the process of verifying we had the extended warranty but only until 100k miles and we are a little over 103k so repairs would not be covered. Price quoted for a new engine is $30,000 or a used engine for $9,000, an engine found online is ~$1,600, these prices don’t even include labor which is another ~$1,500. The car in good running condition is only worth $3100-$4200 according to KBB so we obviously are not going to spend more than the car is worth in repairs. Our info is passed to the sales team and we are told to provide service records and the service consultant will “go to bat” for us with KIA to see if they will cover any of the repair. We don’t hold on to receipts very long so we provided what we could find/get which wasn’t much, and as expected KIA said they would not help, I suspect this would be the case either way as service is where the vast majority of their money is made. We have a 2008 Ford that has never had any issue until 2 days earlier when the transmission gave out at ~150k miles, so I guess we aren’t doing too bad when it comes to vehicle maintenance.

After our info was passed to the sales team, we scheduled a time to come in and discuss trade/purchase of a vehicle. During this discussion of the situation, our credit and available down payment, we were basically told that we should not have bought the first used vehicle to begin with (even though we bought it from Huffines), the sales person also found out we had another working car (how do you think we got there in the first place) and we were then treated as if we didn’t need to replace the car with the seized engine. The sales person also became very uninterested in selling a used car and only seemed to want to sell us a new one. We are upside down on a car that will not be repaired so we cannot roll it into a new purchase and therefore only have 2 options, eat the repair (not going to happen) or try and get approval for another vehicle when we already have 3 financed, one of which is the seized engine, so that is not likely to happen either. So since KIA won’t stand behind their product at all past 100k miles, and Huffines didn’t want anything to do with it, I suppose we are stuck with a very expensive paper weight… Needless to say Huffines and especially KIA are no longer recommended by us or anyone we know.

195,"February 01, 2019","I needed an oil change for sure but wasn’t sure what else, given the miles on my car and other service performed recently. No worries, since all service had previously been done at Huffines, Ralph had already figured out what I needed before I arrived. 
Everything made sense, but it was gonna take awhile longer than I expected, since I had planned to wait. No problem there either as Ralph was able to arrange a free loaner which allowed me to run the errands I had planned to do later.  It was a joy to drive the 2019 Forrester Sport model. I started to wonder if it’s time to trade up.
Then I drove my 2014 Forester home after servicing. It’s been such a great vehicle and with the service boost, it was driving like new!

The first repair was some front end suspension work due to an accident. I feared that the car would never drive the same after the accident, but after Huffines repair you would never know the car was in an accident. I was very pleased with their repair.

On the second occasion, they had to replace my engine due to the recall. The car was repaired much faster than I had expected (granted, I expected them to keep it for months) and I'm excited that it has a new lease on life after their repair. During the time that they had the car, I received periodic updates from my service rep (Ralph).

I've always been impressed with the Dealership and you ALWAYS have receive the ""red carpet"" treatment each and every time.  The sales staff is not pushy but super helpful.  Their aim is to meet your needs, to ensure that you are a satisfied customer and one that will return again and again.  You have a real gem in Ashton May.  He was my original salesman that sold me my first Kia.  He is the main reason I would never go to another dealership. As a salesman he is second to none and now in Finance he is superb.  When I commented that I just put a $300.00 battery in my car he was shocked as EVERYTHING is covered with my maintenance agreement.  He immediately jumped on it and got me reimbursed for the overcharge.  I give the dealership 5-stars in every aspect and recommend them to all my friends.",5.0

I sent out a internet inquiry on the Subaru Crosstrex with the options and color I was looking for. I received a response within the hour from Huffines & all other dealerships 1-4 days later. Not to mention some dealerships would not even consider or negotiation on a vehicle without coming in. My question to those dealerships why even have an internet staff.

Huffines simply the best because of the following results:
Value Customers time - internet sales team negotiated 100% of the vehicle before I visited the dealership. That took 2 days & only because the options I was looking for no one in the metroplex had. 
Huffines sales team scheduled an appointment based on my availability which took 45 min. to review the options, warranty,  appraise my trade-in & sign the buyers agreement. Also on arrival the sales manager says I was able to take another $350.00 dollars off the vehicles sales price. I have never had that happen after agreed on a purchase price.
Once the vehicle arrived at Huffines I was notified by text message which included the time the Crosstrex would be ready to drive out.
The following day no waiting around, the sale team review the vehicle options, warranty, financing  with me in detail, & financing was a breeze. 

Hands down the best dealership for customer service, up & beyond sales team & total satisfaction.

Due to my awful experience at James Wood (the dealership down the street), I was a little gun shy to go through the same process. I was upside down on my trade-in, and was stuck looking at cars that were in a very low budget point so I could reduce my monthly car payments. 
Ben Fernandez and the team at Huffines Kia Subaru Corinth got me out of my upside down 2010 Cadillac and into a brand new 2019 Kia Soul and I'm saving $130/month on payments.

Brent called me when he found out that they were getting a car that may fit me. He emailed me the details to look at. We bought a used car so it was harder to find the features we wanted.

Once we found one, we just went to the dealership to look at. The car went through their 125 checkpoint. They make sure the car is in good condition before turning it over. Love them.

I was aware of the AWD, fuel efficiency, and safety across the brand so I was intrigued as I was down to my top 3 vehicles. Very quickly because of what Subaru offered, it stood out over my other choices (and brands which I was a previous owner). It was really just finding a Subaru platform that fit within my parameters and budget. Working with the team at Huffines was straight-forward, honest, and patient as I made my decision over several days. It was a fantastic team effort from Ben on the phone, Zak with the demo and tech expertise, Aaron with a fair assessment of my trade, Ashton with  efficiency on the finance piece, and Mike staying late to help guide me thru the Starlink set-up. That is a number of moving parts and personalities which were ALL excellent in helping. Not all buying experiences are like this one but they should be and can be if you drive up to Denton to see the Subaru team at Huffines. You guys really exceeded my expectations. All the best to each of you, Chris L. - 2018 Crosstrek ",5.0

It was seamless and it cut down the time that we had to sit in the dealership.  David had the car detailed and ready for use when we go there and we immediately took it on a test drive.  We found one minor issue but he had the replacement part and my car was in the shop in three days to fix it.  David always kept in communication and you can tell he really enjoys his job.  He isn't just another sales guy out to get a sale but a guy who wants to his customers to keep coming back.

After filling out paperwork and confirming financing had been arranged, I drove the Ford home knowing I had 3 days/200mi to return it. Next morning, the dents were painfully obvious. Still, I test drove the vehicle and really liked it, except for the dents. I mentioned the dents to Tom. Based on dent position, and a telltale roof rack installation manual I found in the glove compartment, we assumed an improperly installed or loaded roof rack was the cause. My concern was that the dents reduced resale value of the vehicle, and I provided an Edmunds pricing comparison to support that concern. Tom and the manager evaluated the situation and agreed to reduce the sales price to a level that compensated for the loss of retail value. They also kept a veteran's discount intact. The financing was reasonable. The teamwork demonstrated throughout the process is why I am happy customer.",5.0

I was first impressed by the service center's amenities.  Aside from the normal TV lounge & vending machine setup, the dealership offered an automated snack bar/personal supplies stand (similar to a hotel lobby) and a couple of office work cubicles.  There as free wifi, which allowed me to get some work done while I waited.  It took about one hour for them to assess my vehicle fully and relay the diagnosis to me.  Bosko was my Service Advisor and extremely helpful and patient in answering my questions to ensure that I fully understood my options and the process in general.  Bosko made me feel empowered and knowledgeable regarding the repairs needed, which helped as I had a major service issue that needed to be remedied ASAP (ABS Module needed to be replaced).  I researched the repair costs on third party sites and felt reassured that the repair quote provided to me was well-aligned to the quotes I researched.  I was given a loaner car while they serviced my car, which further added to a wonderful customer experience!

I must have researched a dozen different vehicles at a dozen different dealerships and Mike/Huffines Subaru was the ONLY person/dealer who was willing to work with me via email to get the best deal possible.  Most every other dealer would not even discuss price over email, wanting me to come into their place of business to work on the deal.  I don't have the time or desire to do something like that and really appreciate Mike and Huffine's no pressure sales approach.  Also greatly appreciate the fact that Huffines does not try to tack on hundreds of dollars to the price of a new vehicle for dealer add-ons that I did not request and do not want or need.  Some dealers quoted me outrageous prices for things like window tint, wheel locks or door edge guards.  It was refreshing to work with a dealer that still does business the old fashion way and doesn't use gimmicks to sell a vehicle.

Ben literally took me to a parking lot and gave me a crash course in one of his 2018 WRX's.  Not only is Ben just a really nice guy, he has the patience of a saint.

I am a 23 year old female, and I was treated like the mature adult I carry myself to be.

Sitting in that Subaru parking lot, we worked Google search on our phones and discovered Huffines Subaru Corinth had the car we were looking for! We called and started a wonderful sales experience with Rick Salzman. Rick took our information and promised to walk the lot to make sure our car was physically there.  Then, he texted us the picture AND called us back. We arrived after a scenic drive (an hour) and were warmly greeted by other sales agents.  Such kindness!  Before Rick took us on a test drive, he invited us into his cubicle to chat.  This was terrific, as Rick was able to fully understand our needs and our preferences.  After a terrific test drive, we started to work on the final price and our trade in; we were able to come to a great agreement! Then, Rick offered to see if Ashton May (finance manager) could get us a better loan rate; we were pre-approved at 2.9 from the credit union. And he did - 1.49% Wahoo!  We then met in Ashton's office to complete the paperwork; Ashton was extremely kind in explaining some additional options/warranties that we could add. We did not feel pressured; in fact, it was like talking with an old friend.  We chose to extend the warranty on the electrical systems. Finally, Rick met us out front - and did another run through with us on the MANY features of the Subaru Forester.  Overall, we had a terrific experience!  I think you could work with any sales agent there - there is a sense of family among the people we met.

He listened to what I was wanting and delivered exactly what is was needing. I worked with Brent for several days discussing terms, rates and down payments.

This is the second straight car I have purchased from Huffines KIA in Corinth.

Brett just happened to be the salesman that sold me my previous car, in 2013.  All I had to do was go to the dealership to test drive the car and complete the final transaction with Andrew Gomes.

To me that shows integrity and character, and is what I look for when choosing who I do business with.  I can honestly say that our sales guy Alex Wiederholt, and the general Manager Robert Goodwin went the extra mile to ensure our concerns were not only addressed, but they did everything in their power to make things right so we were extremely satisfied in the end. 
Alex spent about 2 hours going over everything in the car, answered all my questions (and there were a lot of them), he sent the car back to have it rewashed twice to make sure it was spotless, swapped out my car mats, got my license plates off the trade in to avoid future issues, and hung in there until every i was dotted and t crossed.   
I very much appreciate that they spent the time and energy that was put into ensuring I was satisfied with everything.  Other dealers might have blown it off after they made the sale but Huffines Kia of Denton really showed me that they valued me as a customer.

We found the staff to be gracious, knowledgeable, and willing to work with us. We had gone in to specifically purchase one of their listed cars. They worked with us and enabled us to drive out of their lot with that very car. There was no hard sell, no usual drama: Just a straight car deal with the dealership giving us a nice discount!

712,"May 03, 2017","In purchasing a new vehicle, it is a rare occasion to find a dealership with the ability to earn one's complete trust in today's market environment but Huffines Subaru is proof they do exist. From my first conversation regarding the 2017 Crosstrek, Edward Homan and Mike Raupp were straight forward in regard to pricing, availability, and dealer adds. Upon arriving at the dealership, they took the time to ensure I fully understood every aspect of the Crosstrek and how to exploit the current technology available within the vehicle to enhance the safety since my daughter was to be the primary driver.
As a consumer, I can honestly say that my experience with the Huffines dealership is one that is often sought yet seldom found. My requirements were established, discussed, and exceeded by every employee we dealt with from initial discussions through final delivery. In purchasing more than three dozen vehicles over the past 32 years, I can honestly say that Huffines Subaru is one of the best dealerships I have dealt with in more than 30 years.
Our sincere appreciation goes out to Edward, Mike, Ashton, and the entire sales and support team of Huffines Subaru. It is comforting to know that dealerships which base their business on customer satisfaction while maintaining ethical standards still exist. The entire Huffines' Team has my utmost appreciation for the level of professionalism they displayed throughout the entire process. If given the opportunity, my survey would have further illustrated my satisfaction and sincere gratitude in every phase of purchasing my daughters Crosstrek.

Usually the finance dept is the last one to ""wear"" you down by purchasing overpriced and sometimes unnecessary ""add-ons"". 

When my wife and I stopped by to just ""look"" at the Niro (to make sure that my walker/wheelchair would fit in the car), we had absolutely NO intention of purchasing the car that day - we had talked it over and decided we would wait for a month or two to let the ""newness"" of the Niro allow for a better stock at other dealers.

Let me tell you, our experience was definitely worth the drive. Never once did we feel pushed or taken advantage of, which unfortunately been my experience every time I have purchase a car previously. From start to finish we where taken care of. The staff was caring, not manipulative and really cared about what was the best deal for us, rather than what was the best option for them. The car was itself an incredible deal.

After researching we stopped at some places nearby and had a ""fine... normal"" experience looking at various crossovers. Then we got to Huffines Subaru. Wow! From the signs showing their work with animal charities we thought we were going to like these people. We met Raquel and knew it.

We already were aware, by way of a web search, that Huffines did not have the exact model we were looking for and just thought we might be able to order one after looking at something sort of close to what we wanted. So we looked, test drove and had all our questions answered. There was zero pressure, great coffee, a really friendly visit talking about how they might help out with the animal group we are involved in and discussions about exactly what we wanted. She understood exactly what we wanted and why. No talk about how something they had on the lot would be just as good. Then Raquel told us that she could check to see if what we wanted was available locally. It was. She offered us their best price-- no haggling, no ""Let me speak to my manager"". She had it delivered the next day.  We test drove it and bought it immediately. Then we were introduced to the friendly people in the service department. ",5.0

I've been driving a Dodge Grand Caravan, what I lovingly called 'my tin can' because of the safety it WASN'T. My husband and I drove out to Denton from DFW Airport area to also review another brand of car.  After test driving that one, we kept our promise to ourselves to test the Subaru to have a good comparison as we had set out to do. 
Zak was quietly enthusiastic, not bouncing off the walls, but with forward motion in his demeanor if that makes any sense.  He was a good listener, answering all the silly questions I had.
Long story shorter, we went for the test drive and took a little bit longer than others might have, ran the vehicle over good bumps (I always seem to be able to find those!), did a couple fantastic u-turns, checked the lane warnings and other cool features. I really liked the safety features Zak explained, including the way it hugged the road. Zak made me bring him and the car back and, after a bit more Q&A, we were done and ready to buy. Zak took us through the purchase process lickety split. He recognized that we are experienced buyers and put on his ""this was YOUR idea"" face.

814,"October 15, 2016","My experience at this Huffines in Denton was phenomenal. I found a car of theirs on the Cars.com app and wanted to check it out so I put in an inquiry to see if it was still available. I did the same with another Kia Optima that I saw on their as well and the second I did for this other car. A man called, left a voicemail, emailed, and texted me all in a matter of 5 minutes and at this time I knew he was going to be very  obnoxious and not leave me alone. (This did not happen at the Huffines dealership.) When I inquiried on the Optima here I got a call from Scooter and left a very pleasant voicemail for me to take my time and get back to him whenever I'm ready and let me know the car is still inventory. He actually took the time to get up and go look in the lot to find it and see it for himself rather than just seeing it on inventory. After that I gave him a call back and he asked if I would like to come see the car whenever I'm free, he was very accommodating. I scheduled an appointment for later that week it was great. I arrived and it was very easy to find scooter, everyone at this dealership is so kind and happy and they take the time to stop what they're doing to help you. Once I was with scooter he took me out to the car to check it out (this car is amazing by the way I recommend the EX). I loved it, after we went inside and he let me do all the talking instead of putting pressure into buying it that second. At that time I knew I was purchasing. Loved the car and the service what more could I want! I told him I had to get with my bank and get back to him and after that, he didn't bother me once. He gave me his cell in case I needed him on Sunday because they weren't open. I texted him on Sunday and he was very quick to respond. I could go on and on about how great this service was. When I came in Tuesday to purchase my car he was again, very relaxed. The process was easy and fast. He worked with my bank personally to help me out faster. Everything was amazing about this process and I recommend going to this dealership to get your next car if you like to stay away from pressuring people! Thank you so much again Scooter!",5.0

816,"October 13, 2016","This was the 10th personal vehicle that I have purchased in my lifetime. At age 66, I have purchased family cars in 2 different countries and 5 different states. Our experiences at Huffines Kia Subaru of Corinth. Texas exceeded any of the experiences that we have previously experienced. Ben Frazer, the Sales Rep,  was personable, patient, and extremely detailed as he helped us define and select the features that we wanted on our 2017 Forester.  We had not expected to find the exact car that we wanted, but Ben found one that met all of our needs and desires and found it with some additional features that we had not anticipated. And he found it within several hours of our first visit to the dealership. No price haggling, just pure business and a reasonable price quote. Ashton May in finance  worked through the finance terms and found us the best terms  available (0% for 48 months) and the GAP and extended warranty that met our needs and budget. He was professional and efficient. On pickup up of the vehicle days later, the car was ready down to virtually every minute detail and we were given a thorough review of all of the cars features and operation. Jim Born a second Sale Rep, who I had spoken to over the phone about 6 months previously, also met and assisted us. We felt like it was a real team effort focused on one thing, making us satisfied with the handoff of our new Forester.   We drove over 26 miles to Huffines, from down in Tarrant County, because of two reasons. First, because they were a certified dealer designated by USAA, our insurance company and USAA is very selective who they recommend to their military membership. Secondly, because we had heard that the Huffine Auto Dealerships in the D/FW metroplex area were the premier automobile dealer family in North Texas for service.  We were not disappointed and my wife and I give kudos to the folks at Huffines for running a real class act from top to bottom. Although we did not interact with the service folks, their care in preparing our car was also excellent.  Our only complaint ? We wish that Huffines was closer to our home.  They are good solid folks to deal with.     ",4.8

My husband and I drove up that very evening and Matt immediately showed us the Subaru Crosstrek that had all the features I was looking for and asked if we'd like to test drive the vehicle.

Off the lot, and the journey began.  I immediately noted the smooth ride, braking and driver visibility, three 'must haves' in my book.  My yellow Labrador travels with me often.  And safety is actually my number one priority.  I needed a vehicle that would offer an easy entry for my older dog, and one that would allow her a comfortable sitting position for those all important, 'hang my head out the window' moments.

On a personal note:  Our oldest daughter was rear-ended in a BMW 380i by a driver at 55 miles an hour, as her vehicle sat at a full stop (due to road construction).  The rear end folded completely!  Our daughter walked away from the accident, unscathed, although shaken.  When my son-in-law came upon the accident (he's a highway patrolman), he literally could not believe the scene.  Later we would ask him, ""What color will your next one be?""  Without hesitation, ""I'm not sure, but I'm looking to getting her a Subaru.""  Before we could even ask, ""Why?"" He responded, ""They're the safest vehicles on the road.""

After driving around the lot, checking out the available cars, we thought we would go in and check out some we had seen.A very tall young man Ben Frazier asked if he could help us. And the process began. It was nice, easy, no stress, he gave us crackers and drinks as we discussed the available stock. Within a few minutes we were able to test drive a few cars. Once I choose the one I liked, he figured up the cost, checked my credit, and sent me to the finance area. No long drawn out hours waiting to speak to his manager, no endless back and forth debates on price, it was easy to understand and efficiently done. We were done with the entire process, and I was able to walk out excited and happy with the choices I had made. Thank you Ben Frazier for making the process a good one!",5.0

877,"July 22, 2016","We stopped on whim just to see what they had and were surprised to find great cars for very reasonable prices. My wife and I picked out what we liked and got the ball rolling with Ryan Majors, sales person of the year, if you ask me.  That guy can run from the sales office to the finance office and back faster than a cheetah on Adderall.  We had a few hoops to jump through because we are in an active chapter 13 but Ryan stayed in contact with us everyday until we had received approval from the Trustee.  Unfortunately they wound up selling the car I wanted (money talks right), but I got the next best thing and my wife got exactly what she wanted.  Ryan went above and beyond in helping us get though a process full of red take and was able to get us both in new (to us) certified pre-owned of which we couldn't be happier.  If you stop by be sure to ask for Ryan Majors.  He's very professional but can sprint back and forth like nobody else.   ",4.8

In 2014 and 2016 I purchased new Subaru Foresters from Huffine's in Corinth/Denton. Driving the 61 miles up I-35W is no fun at all. It takes between 1.5 and 2 hours to made each one-way trip. However, the friendliness, service, and the fact that they ALWAYS go beyond the ordinary not only to make the price and the financing work but also to arrange shuttle service from closer distances when needed....and they are just plain NICE!

While the credit for immaculate condition goes to the owners, Huffines deserves credit for an excellent buying experience. Although a car is a commodity, dealerships often try to extract money from clients; they cross-sell, up-sell and use the FUD factor - Fear Uncertainty & Doubt. Rick or anyone else at Huffines never did that.

Rick is a retired executive and helps customers make an informed decision; he was pleasant, polite; he answered all questions to my satisfaction and returned 100% of my calls promply (yes, car sales guys often don't).

All in all, it took me 30 minutes to walk out with the car keys once I made a decision. Absolutely 5 star service.

They could have charged me more; when I asked them why they agreed to my price, I was told the Huffines family does not believe in over-charging. 

If you are looking for a new or a used car, I would definitely recommend Rick Salsman. Go give him and Huffines a try; you will be a happy camper!

We were told that we could come back Saturday, that the car would be clean, fueled up and the paperwork ready so that we could wrap things up quickly.  On Sat we confirmed we were headed that way for our appt.  We arrived and the car was not fueled up, paperwork was not ready and we waited over 45 minutes to get to sign the paperwork on a cash deal.  When we went in to sign, Joe in finance dismissed our wait by opening with ""I understand you had to wait just a LITTLE bit"", we told him yes and it was inconvenient because we had been in the night before and were told things would be ready when we returned on Sat.  His response was ""well, Saturdays do get busy"" again dismissive.  When we advised that we had no interest in any add on products or extended warranties, he because very rude, shoved papers across the desk with instructions to sign.  On the last paper, he folded them up, slid them across the table, turned his back and picked up his phone.  Not ""thank you"", not ""we appreciate the business"" not anything.  I have never encountered anyone so rude and unprofessional. What Joe didn't know and apparently didn't care is that due to a medical condition, it was very uncomfortable for me to sit and wait and I was in a LOT of pain - which is why we were clear with Ryan that things needed to be ready.  It was clear to me that this dealership is about the transaction of selling cars and selling ad on products and not about the client experience or relationship - especially when a repeat customer is treated this way.  Joe furthered my decision when it became apparent that because he wasn't profiting off of financing (since we paid cash) or add on warranties (since we declined) that he had no use for us.  When my husband walked back in to let him know that if this car had not been for an excited 17 year old - waiting in the lobby, that we would have walked from the deal, Joe's response was ""well, you were rude to me"".  We weren't rude, just in a hurry and uncomfortable, however, as a service provider, that shouldn't have mattered anyway.  ",1.5
940,"March 30, 2016","I came to Huffines Kia in Denton fully expecting NOT to buy a new car.  I was greeted, but not overwhelmed, by Andrew Gomes and he saw me through the entire, painless, process of purchasing my first car.  Andrew was extremely informative about the KIA Forte and took great attention to detail about what I needed and expected in a mid-size vehicle.  He was very attentive to my budget and even spent time drawing with my granddaughter who was with me through the whole purchase.  I appreciated the staff as well as my finance manager, Ashton May, in keeping my budget within reach and not pushing me for all the extras that could have pushed me over the edge and created buyers remorse.

942,"March 22, 2016","Excellent customer care and would definitely recommend to family and friends.  Initially I was shopping online for a Scion Tc when I found one at Huffines Kia Subaru Denton that said “coming soon”.  I gave a call to the dealership and spoke with Zak Barnett who informed me that the car was not quite ‘show ready’ but asked me for my cellphone number and texted me pictures of the interior and exterior within the hour.  Awesome job!!  That evening I was able to test drive the vehicle and immediately fell in love with it.  While there I also saw a Hyundai Genesis that I thought would be perfect for my wife.  Zak was tending to another customer so he partnered me with Ben Frazer (who also was super) so that I could test drive the Genesis.  Long story made short, the wife and I came back a day later and after a brief, pressure free negotiation we wound up buying both vehicles!!  Working with Ashton May to complete the paperwork was a breeze and within an hour I was able to drive off with my new Tc while Zak delivered the Genesis to my house.  If you’re looking for an excellent car buying experience please allow this dealership to compete for your business, you won’t be disappointed!!!

952,"March 11, 2016","I went to this dealer to check out a preowned Kia, not being 100% sure that I was ready to purchase immediately.  My sales guy, Zak, was courteous, welcoming and seemed to have a genuine *interest* in my situation of having financing and cash in hand but not bring in a huge hurry. And although the first car I looked at did end up selling that day to another buyer, Zak was encouraging that we'd find another car. 

Even after I'd been to some other shops in the following days, Zak politely reached out to me a couple of times to highlight cars they'd recently taken in, and we found the perfect vehicle at a great price/condition that my family is ecstatic about! 

Finance dude Ashton was awesome to work with: straightforward, no hype, efficient and courteous.  He was awesome. 

Even my encounter with the sales manager Edwin, when surrendering the title to my trade, was pleasant and I genuinely felt like he not only was happy to have made the sale but wanted me to be 100% satisfied.  I haven't always had the most awesome interactions w Managers, so this was a nice plus. He took time to tell me where my car had come from and how he'd decided to buy it for the dealership.

Cate replies fast and addressees every question. They are very upfront on what they can and can't do so haggling is kept to a minimum. She worked hard to get me the best price to fit my limited budget and I will bring anyone I can to her and this dealership. They have earned a lifetime customer and a walking, talking advertisement in me.

Extra notes: This is a small dealer with a laid back atmosphere. You can tell people enjoy working there and that is a GREAT THING.

965,"February 24, 2016","Seriously was dreading the whole car buying experience. My guard was up. I didn't want to find a car I liked because I didn't want to deal with the inevitable haggling and literal hours wasted trying to get a deal done. 
Drove the 2016 Subaru Forester. Loved it, but tried not to let on that I loved it. Went home. Gave a what I felt was a fair offer (and expected haggling to commence). It didn't.  Offer was accepted. Ben promised they wouldn't try to keep me there any longer than necessary. We decided on terms. I told Joey (Finance) what I did/did not want, and expected more haggling and sales pitches. He brought out my paperwork, and included only what I requested. 

I was done in 90 minutes, tops. Including Ben showing me how to use the car and setting up Bluetooth and such.

He treated us the way that we like to be treated and went to great lengths to help us make a good decision, order a new Outback, take delivery, and understand everything that we need to know to get the most enjoyment out of our new car. We initially contacted a Subaru dealer in Dallas, but they were pretty cold and not willing to work with us on price. Then I started an email dialog with Mike. We proceeded cautiously because our last car-buy experience elsewhere was not so great. But Mike proved that it can be great if you are dealing with the right people. Joe in finance was also very helpful and straightforward and didn't play games with us. We honestly didn't think the car-buying experience could be like this. Even if you live closer to Dallas, like us, we HIGHLY recommend that you contact Mike at Huffines Subaru Denton if you are in the market for a new vehicle. You will not be disappointed.

974,"February 09, 2016","I contacted this dealership online after finding a listing for a car on Autotrader that I liked, but was a little above what I budgeted out. Raquel Mitchell responded promptly, and we agreed on a price quickly. 

What I really appreciated was that she didn't use any sales pitches or sales language on me. I contacted several other dealerships in the area in the same way, trying to get a price on the car I wanted. Every time I did so, instead of being met with a response like Raquel's, I was given something to the tune of: ""We would love to help you find the perfect car you want! When can you come by and see us?""  When I responded that I was from out of town and needed to agree on a price on a specific car before coming by, I received basically an identical reply. Could've even been an auto-reply, for all I could tell. What that tells me is you likely want to get me on the lot and try to get a couple extra thousand out of me. 

With Raquel, the return email was quick, and she got me the price I wanted, as well as telling me what the total would be including TTL, instead of trying the usual ""how much do you want to pay a month?"" tactic common among many dealerships. She was very patient in answering all of my questions, and even came in on her day off to deliver the car to us personally. Very impressive. I would definitely recommend Huffines to anyone looking for a car in the area, and Raquel in particular. 

One quick note: finance will still try to sell you extra warranties and coverage, even on a certified pre-owned vehicle, and will list it out as how much you pay monthly rather than the extra cost over the life of the loan, so be prepared for that. That said, Ashton May was very courteous, and I'm fairly certain this is standard practice at every dealership. I'm sure some people like the extra peace of mind, so this did not bother me.

While I obviously cannot guarantee this is how they treat every customer, this was by far and away the best, most upfront treatment I got from any dealership, either in Lubbock or in the Dallas area. Being honest about pricing and understanding customer's needs will get my return business every time, even if I have to drive 300+ miles to get there.",5.0
975,"February 05, 2016","I have been looking for a crossover SUV for about a month.  I test drove at least 8 different crossovers.  I watched dozens of YouTube reviews.  I analyzed the specifics and even made my own chart with positives and negatives.  When it was over, I decisively settled on the Subaru Forester.  Feature for feature the Subaru beat the competition and price.  For me the eyesight technology was the deciding factor.  I wanted the extra protection the eyesight provides.  Some of my friends think it is silly for a vehicle to assist in breaking and lane detection but they are probably the same people who laughed when computers and calculators came out.  On the three drive home from the dealership someone cut off the vehicle in front of me.  I reacted for the break and before my foot pressed on the pedal the vehicle was already breaking.  This technology is awesome.  During this three hour drive I only had to press the break or gas once or twice.  This greatly reduced the stress during the high traffic areas.  

Raquel Mitchel the sales representative at Huffines answered all my questions and more.  I have contacted three Subaru dealerships and they were all excellent and would receive 5 stars from me but there is something special about Raquel that made me choose Huffines.  I had dozens of questions and she answered them all.  She was not overbearing but she provided the support I needed and continues to provide support after the sale.  Outstanding job!

Before buying a new car, I was lucky enough to have the time to properly research the options available and compare the safety ratings, pricing, reliability, value, and consumer ratings. Looking at that data and my priorities, safety, function and value, the Subaru Outback, Forester and Crosstrek were my best options. I made an appointment and arrived at the dealership for a few test drives. Michael Raupp let me evaluate each vehicle and answered every question I had along the way. He was courteous and helpful and showed a genuine interest in making sure I got what I wanted for a fair price. After a few test drives over a couple days, it was clear that the Outback was the car I wanted. In the end, I purchased an extremely well built vehicle that meets my needs, at a better-than-fair price I can afford, and I understood and felt comfortable with the entire transaction. ",5.0

1001,"December 30, 2015","I have been looking for a WRX STI for a while, but now finally had time to visit this dealership that my good friend recommended. I am very glad I did. Ended up buying a new STI.

To summarize briefly: We were greeted and asked what we're looking for within moments arriving to the dealership. After we mentioned that we'll just look around first, they actually let us browse without harassing.
Getting to a test drive was simple and easy enough. No pointless, check out this car has loud stereo thing to try to cover some other random noises.
While getting a quote numbers were adjusted only once, nothing like ""I have to talk to my manager"" for every single thing. This Ryan guy was not pushing anything, just did what was asked and commented what was relevant. Big plus on that!

I was also greeted by the financial guy to understand some things better. Following next business day I was there to pick up my new car, and all was set ready. Good explanation was give, this is how do you this and that. They made very sure that I have all things answered and am ready to go.

The random part was that they had one Finnish person working there, so random meeting with another person from The Motherlandia was sort of a sign that this cannot go too bad. She spoke Oulu's dialect, which made it even more random.

All in all... Out of 3 car purchases here in USA this has been the best so far. I would recommend anyone whom is seriously looking for a car to go here! ",4.8

With the rollout of the 2016 Subarus, most of every dealers (we looked a a few in and out of town) showed ""in transit"".  So, it was hard to find an Outback that was in the lot.  We visited Huffines and they had one Outback in stock.  We were introduced to Rick Salsman.  Since this Outback was to be my wife's new car, she was very specific about what color she wanted - Wilderness Green.  Well, that color is pretty hard to come by.  At any rate, we held off on making any car buying decisions until November.  Rick had been very patient on contacting us periodically to see how we were doing on our decision to buy an Outback, but we were not ready to make the purchase.  My wife looked last Monday at Huffines Subaru website, and saw that they had the color Outback she wanted.  She quickly went to the dealer, and we started the process of getting our trade-in appraised and applying for the loan.  I was working that day and was not with my wife.  I was able to do the credit app online for joint ownership and that went very smoothly.  They made a reasonable offer on the trade in, and the price was right were it should be on the new Outback.  Within a couple of hours, the car was hers.  We closed on the deal Monday afternoon.  Rick was awesome!  He was very, very thorough and clear on explaining everything about the car and how to navigate through the daunting myriad of bells and whistles the car has.

But when I bought my two new cars here, they helped me with several issues, and didn't charge me...Mostly computer-related stuff I needed assistance with, such as adjusting the alarm system.  The service staff was pleasant, knowledgeable and helpful, so was the parts department.",5.0
1062,"August 29, 2015","Excellent experiences.  In fact, I bought 2 cars on different occasions from the same salesman.  Their service and parts departments also provided top-notch service.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend these folks to a friend, and there are very few establishments of any kind for which I would say that.

I usually don't bother to write good reviews of dealerships because such dealerships don't really need them.  Real people tell other real people, and over the years they build up a good reputation the hard way--they earn it!  But I just got through writing a scathing review about another Subaru dealership in the DFW area, and I felt compelled to balance that with a good one!

You need to know I'm not easy to impress.  In my lifetime I've encountered only two dealerships I would rate A+.  And for those, I just got lucky and stumbled upon them by total chance.  How do you find a truly good dealership?  I dunno.  I suppose you have to try a lot of them, and be willing to walk out of all those that aren't good.  (I've done a whole lot of walking out in my days.  LOL)

So all I can say is give these guys a shot.  Of the many dealerships I've visited over the years, I think they're one of the best.  (regardless of brand)",4.8

I told him to give me a good price, to which he did, and didn't play any games.  After doing the online credit app and a few emails back and forth, I went to see him that Saturday morning.  Ashton was very friendly, extremely helpful, and the paperwork process went smoother than I was expecting.

1065,"August 24, 2015","To start this review I would just like to mention that this is my first experience with leasing or buying a vehicle direct from a dealer. From the moment that I was contacted by Brett Clark regarding an inquiry I submitted online, I felt confident that Huffines Kia was going to be the dealer we ended up leasing from, and I was right. The first call I had with Brett he wasted no time trying to simply get me to come in to the dealer, which i especially appreciated since we do live 40 minutes away. He plainly gave me a quote of what I could expect to pay and that gave a great baseline for shopping around. However, none of the other dealers I contacted could beat the deal so my wife and I decided to head up to Kia. 

Brett had already reserved the exact vehicle we were looking at and it was ready for a test drive once we arrived. Addison Slone was a great help and very personable. Even though we arrived at 7:30pm Addison and everyone else patiently helped us until we made our final decision. Unfortunately the only ""hiccup"" was with the bank which caused us to come back the next day to finalize but at least we did get to take the car home that evening.

1071,"August 09, 2015","I bought my car in about 3 hours. It was a pleasant experience. I walked in to see someone else that got there right when the dealership opened buying the very car I'd looked up online and intended to purchase. I was kind of annoyed and in a bad mood, having looked all over DFW for a white base 2016 WRX. 

Alex saved the day tough. He found me a white base 2016 WRX in white at a dealership in Oklahoma. I told him what I wanted to pay and he even worked things out with the finance manager for me.  Apparently their fiance manager isn't exactly a peach and that made things take longer than they should have, but Alex is is the only one who had to deal with him so I can't really count that against my experience. All I had to do was sign some papers. He even hooked me up with a loaner for the three days it took to get my car. John Born helped out too he was the one who ended up handing the car over to me the evening I drove into town to pick it up and return my loaner. Alex was the one who did most of the heavy lifting.

I love my car and buying it from Alex was pretty easy.

 At best I was very skeptical aboutgoing to another dealership. during my first visit I thought I was right about my skepticism. After talking with Mr. Goodwin, Mr. Vivar and Addison about my concerns they did everything the way I wanted to do them. I already had my own financing but they were able to beat the terms and the interest rate so I financed with them as well

Thank you for making this purchase go smoothly and doing everything you said you would do.

Now we got a good deal, but what made Huffines Kia a five star dealership was the way our sales rep, Bernard Scott treated everyone in our family.  He spoke to everyone and did not act like he was trying to sell a car.  Never a high pressure conversation, and negotiations were easy.  My soon to be driving son told me that he wants us to buy his car from Bernard when he starts driving.  That pretty much seals the deal.

Michael Raupp gave a great test drive; answered questions, offered information about features, and tried to discover what I was looking for.  I didn't share a lot of information with him!  After we (my husband was with me) left the dealership, I had a hectic week at work and then left for a week's vacation.  I never returned any of the polite, brief phone messages Michael left for me.  When I returned, I asked my husband to find the best deal possible on an Outback.  I wasn't committed to anything other than having a 2.5i Limited; color, additional features, none of that was worth spending more on.  I assumed I'd be going to Minnesota or Colorado or possibly New England to pick up a car purchased on the internet.  Surprisingly, Michael was able to provide a deal that was solid enough to make me purchase locally.  I walked in, signed the paperwork, and left for an evening meeting.  I don't know that Michael has ever had so little interaction with a buyer!  But he did a great job.

I checked with several dealers within 500 miles of my home (El Paso, Texas).  My local dealer was rude, and very hard to deal with.  I called several dealers in Dallas and surrounding area.  Huffines was one of the only dealers to call me back personally within 24 hours.  While they did not have the car I wanted in stock, they were able to tell me that they would have one within 14 days.  They held the car for me, and even negotiated my trade over the phone.  I sent them plenty of photos of trade, along with original window sticker.  Within a few hours, I basically knew what I would be paying after my trade, including tax, title, and license.  The deal saved me more than $2000 over what I was able to negotiate locally.  I drove the 500 miles, and they had the car waiting for me outside the dealership.  Within an hour, I had all the paperwork signed and I was done.  By far, one of the easiest, most pleasant deals I have ever made.  
Alex Hagag was a great sales person.  Kept in communication with me and was very accommodating.  I can't say enough about the positive experience I had with Huffines and Alex.

By far, Raquel Mitchell and Alex Hagag were the most professional, knowledgeable, and friendly. Instead of relying on outdated and underhanded sales tactics to influence me to purchase my Subaru, Raquel and Alex's passion for the brand and focus on customer service sold me to do business with Huffines. Through the process, Alex and Raquel ensured that my fiancee and I chose the right car for us.

Yet he wasn't pushy at all and not once asked me anything related to buying the car (I wasn't ready to buy that day anyway).  He just liked talking about the Outback and all the features it had to offer which made me feel at ease and also got me more excited about the car.  That left me with a positive experience during my visit to Huffines Subaru.  Later I communicated with Tim Spencer via email over a few weeks time about various things related to the car arriving and price.  He always replied to me within one business day or less and was up front and honest in answering my questions, never avoiding anything I asked.

I was honest with Cate as far as my plan to test all three cars before making a decision.  She was very helpful in answering all my questions and understanding about my desire to test all three. I visited a total of three separate dealerships before returning to Subaru to purchase my car.  The difference in her attitude towards my desire to test all three vehicles and her genuine interest in helping was hands down far superior to the other experiences I had at the other dealers.  We arrived late on a Saturday and she stayed several hours after closing and never made us feel rushed or pressured.

1145,"January 26, 2015","After scouring the internet for the specific 2015 Subaru Outback I wanted, I found the car I was looking for at Huffines. Even though it was a bit of a drive, it was worth it for me to get the car I wanted. Overall that experience was really good. It was a brand new car, the price was negotiated before I arrived so there wasn't much room for something to go wrong. The salesman were polite and professional.

Because of this experience, when my dad wanted an AWD vehicle, I pushed him towards a Forester. I found the car he wanted at Huffines through Auto Trader. After several discussions about the condition of the car, I elected to drive to TX (I live in KS) and buy it. When we arrived there was a scuff on the rear bumper that was not previously disclosed. I was told throughout all of our conversations the car was in excellent condition and that Rick, the salesperson, had no concerns with me driving from KS to get this car. After negotiating a discount for the paint repair, my boyfriend test drove the car and reviewing the CARFAX and we purchased it. About 2-2.5 hours down the highway, we smelled oil. It appeared the oil filter was not on tight and oil misted over the engine. At the point I emailed Rick and told her of the issue in the event I had additional problems.

The oil smell continued so I took it to my local Subaru dealership for service. They discovered that in October 2014 the short block engine, among other things, had been replaced in this car and there were several issues from that work. Huffines did not do that warranty work. It has now been 29 days since I took the Forester to the shop and I still do not have it back.

My main issues with Huffines are their lack of follow up and customer service. Once the sale was completed, they seemed to wash their hands of it. I know if I sold someone a car and bragged about the clean CARFAX and that the CARFAX showed a positive number, I would feel awful when I found out the engine had been replaced and now my customer has been waiting almost a month for their car to be returned. The only communication between Rick or any of the sales team has been initiated by myself or my boyfriend. Huffines customer service after the sale is terrible. There is no follow-up when issues arise. I will never buy a vehicle from them again, nor will I recommend their dealership. Since that experience with Huffines I have purchased another Subaru who has actually followed up after the sale.",2.0

We reached a fair agreement fast and I was on my way in a new Forester in short order. I would not hesitate recommending Michael to anyone. Love the Forester so far.

However, after a great test drive of the Optima EX w/ premium package we thought leasing a new Kia would make better financial sense.  From the time we test drove the car until we decided to lease it, the sales staff at Huffines Kia Subaru Denton were very professional.  We did not feel high pressure sales tactics and that is probably what kept me loyal to come back.  I hope our relationship continues to go just as well through out the lease.

Spoke with the manager and he told me that I got a ""good"" deal!  I asked if he would honor the original price and he kept re-iterating that I got a ""good"" deal!!  He said he didn't remember giving me that price and that I was just a ""NUMBER"" to them.  Said they were just trying to get a car sold by the end of the year to close out their books and make their quota.

1214,"August 03, 2014","I recently was in the market with my wife to purchase a 2015 Subaru Outback.  I met Paul Jackmann and Michael B at this dealership as my salesmen to help me out purchase a Subaru.  They both were very nice.  When we went into the dealership, they greeted both me and my wife well, explained everything about the Subaru to us and gave us a very nice test drive tour of both the Outback and Foresster.  We worked with 5 other dealerships in the area (including Randall Noe in Terrell, TX) to find the best possible price on the 2015 Subaru Outback 2.5i limited.  Paul/Mike were very adamant on the prices.  They would not budge on the prices at all.  When we got the best deal with Randall Noe and told both about it, they seemed to take a don't care attitude and started bad mouthing Randall Noe of misrepresentation and swindling their customers.  

Yesterday (Sat), we went to Randall Noe to purchase our Subaru.  Our experience with Randall Noe has been wonderful day #1.  The salesman there sent us all the estimates + drive out prices (including TT&L) in writing via email and later on even sent us the buyer's agreement showing the total drive out price clearly.  She also took multiple calls from us, answered all of our questions and assured us multiple times they are not going to surprise us with hidden costs etc.  Well, that was indeed true when we went to pick up car from them.  It was a smooth, pleasant experience.  Both their sales and financial folks did not pressure us and we were out in 2 hours from the dealership driving back with our new Subaru home!!

I am quite surprised and shocked at such horrible, negative tactics played by Subaru of Denton by bad mouthing other dealerships just to be able to gouge their customers by charging more.  They tout of customer service and care.  I laugh at that because I was going to pay them 2,000 extra $ for the car thus pleasing their pocket and getting screwed myself in the end.

So my message would be go to Subaru of Denton to test drive the car and learn about the car but go to Randall Noe to buy the car.  They will cut you the best deal.  Go to Subaru of Denton if you have too much money growing on the tree and are looking to throw it in the lake or it is not your hard earned money.",2.0

The dealership offered us fair trade in values and we felt we got a good deal without all the normal haggling I detest.  We definitely will come back to Huffines Kia Subaru for another car and I hope Paul is still working there!!!  If you want a Subaru, this is the best dealership in the DFW area.

1229,"June 23, 2014","I contacted the dealership through the on-line quotation process last week when I was looking to purchase an Outback for my wife for our anniversary.  I received a prompt reply on the pricing and found out the car I was looking at was a demo.  It was not listed as such on the website.  I have never been too excited with demo vehicles, but decided I would go to the dealership to see what was in stock as the Subaru promotion on financing was appealing to me.  Overall I am very pleased with the service I received.  There was quite a bit of waiting at the salesman's desk while he ran off to speak to whomever was in charge of the numbers, but that is what I expected.  I have purchased many GM cars over the years because I had a very strong relationship with a salesperson at James Woods of Denton.  Unfortunately, she passed away several years ago from cancer, so I have branched out and purchased a Volkswagen and now this Subaru.  The reason why I liked Kay so much at James Wood's is that I knew I could work directly with her.  No running to the sales manager's desk every time I had a question.  She charged me $100 over invoice and I purchased 8 vehicles from her before she became sick.  

So far the Subaru Outback has exceeded my expectations and my wife loves the car.  So, thanks for the good first impression and Chris Riddle's patience as my family and I decided on which vehicle we wanted.  I will add however, one of the cars we looked at was a demo being driven by one of the staff as a daily driver.  I understand the perks of working for a car dealership, but if it is on the sale list and customers will be looking at the car to buy, maybe removing all of the personal items (like your children's toys and shoes and the impressions left in the seats by the child's car seat) would be a good idea.  It did not have the appearance of a new car when it looked like a used car in the grocery store parking lot.

Overall I am very satisfied with the experience at Huffines Subaru in Denton, and I will recommend the dealership to everyone I talk with about my new Outback.

And by the way, leaving the information on this review was a very long and stressful experience.

1235,"June 15, 2014","The car I purchased was fairly priced (after a couple of markdowns), and they helped me, a first time borrower, secure what I consider to be fair financing terms based on what I needed. Rick was the salesman I worked with and he was beyond helpful. He seemed to want to make sure that it was a good experience for me, and I really appreciate that. It's been about a week and a half since I purchased the car and Rick has reached out to me by email a few times just to make sure that I wasn't having any issues. I spoke to Edwin, who I believe was the Preowned Sales Manager, a couple of times. While Rick was everything you want in a dealer, the same can't be said for Edwin, at least not from my experience. He was not friendly at all, and honestly did not seem like he wanted to sell me the car. He told me that they had to pay a fee to the lender in order to secure financing, so maybe that had something to do with it. I opted not to purchase the extended warranty, as the manufacturer's warranty is under effect for awhile longer, and I can wait and get one cheaper after that is no longer in effect. This was unacceptable to Edwin. Obviously, I expect him to try to sell me the warranty as most dealers make quite a lot of money that way. That's fine, as I know what I came there for. He shouldn't, however, have insisted to me when I asked what the payments would be without the warranty that the extended warranty was a requirement of the lender. He wanted me to believe that I needed to pay $2,000 for their warranty or else the lender would not give me a loan. This clearly was a lie, as I didn't buy the warranty, and yet drove away in the vehicle with the same financing terms that were on the table when he said that. I never received an explanation as to why he told me that. 
All of that being said, I'll probably be back. Everything about the experience was great except for that one guy. The car had a full tank of gas, extremely clean, etc. Thanks Rick!",4.8

To my surprise not only did I fit; I had additional headroom I wasn't expecting. The car is a 4 cylinder and runs great. 
But back to the car buying experience; I told William what I wanted my monthly payment to be and between the William and Brad Chambless they were able to find financing to fit my needs.

1243,"June 02, 2014","My wife and I had replaced our 2007 Hyundai Entourage with a 2014 Outback from the same dealer. Rick Salsman was the salesman and was Great, The Outback was everything they said but we found out it did not fit our lifestyle and was not big enough. My wife and I agreed we wanted another van, The Entourage was really a Kia Sedona. That is what we wanted.I used the online chat to set an appointment. Met William and started the process, I was shocked at how much value the Outback had lost and the numbers were not going to work for us, William was talking to Manager Robert and I went in and thanked them for their time but did not see anyway we could get together. Boy was I wrong. Robert said he would see what he could do. I returned Williams call and he said they had found  a way to keep my payments the same and get everything we wanted, We started over   $125.00 a month apart and that did not include road hazard or extended maintenance or ding /interior coverage. They found a 75 month 2.125 % loan and rolled all the extras we had on the Outback onto the Sedona. For the Same payment We rcvd a $4500 more expensive vehicle and about $3000 dollars worth of dealer add on options. If it can be done ROBERT AND HIS CREW WILL DO IT! My wife is very happy with the van and I am impressed with the improvements since 2007. Thanks to all of you involved and I apoligize if I missed any one.

I had a friend just buy a new Kia Sportage and she had been showing it to me and I really liked it. I had intended to just LOOK around. As I was looking in the windows Tom Talbot came out to see if he could help me and I told him I was getting an oil change and thought I would just look around. He offered to go get some keys so I could look inside instead of gazing through the windows.  He was so kind and never one time tried to pressure me into buying. He stayed right with me answering all my questions, offering a test drive but again I said I was just looking waiting for my car to be finished. 

We went inside he got me some bottled water listened to my concerns--still no pressure! Well to make a long story short--I am the very proud and happy owner of a new Kia Sportage!

I do and will continue to tell people how great everyone is here from the buying experience to the service dept. The service dept is a big factor in where I buy a car and this one is great!

1249,"May 23, 2014","I spent almost a year looking at all the cars available on the market today. I rented or test drove 4 of my 6 choices. I was not comfortable with how any of them drove and I always felt pressured by the salesperson to make a purchase right on the spot.

Subaru was my second to last test drive. When you walk into the showroom, it is very calm and quiet, no loud speakers or crazy music. When I met Mike Bresnahan, I felt that he sincerely wanted to put me in a car I would love. He listened to my needs and spent a lot more time with me than I expected but never made me feel pressured to buy or that I was taking up too much of his time. 

It's a whole different kind of sales process at Huffines Subaru. The test drives were not just fun they were downright exciting! It was a hard decision between the Forester and the XV Crosstrek! They are both terrific cars to drive, but I finally chose the Crosstrek and just love it!

I felt that Mike gave me excellent technical and pricing information about both cars so I could make my own decision. Once I decided, I was even more impressed with how Mike spent (more) time with me going over all the features on my Crosstrek before I left the dealership. I love being part of the Subaru ""family"" and knowing that my purchase is helping our environment.

The morning I picked up my car, the first thing Mike said to me was ""Thank you for your business"". I never hear that anymore. I really felt appreciated! I will definitely send anyone I know who is thinking of making a car purchase over to see Mike and the Huffines team.

By the way, I never looked at that last car on my list of 6 choices. No regrets at all, Love my Crosstrek! Thank you Mike and the Huffines team.

1251,"May 17, 2014","My wife was on her way home from playing golf with our son when she called me at work saying her car (2008 Mercury Mariner) was making a noise. I told her that I would leave early and we would check it out.
When I got home, we went for a drive and the noise that started out sporadic and slight, became very frequent and louder and louder. We debated - do we go to a repair shop, bite the bullet and pay the price to get it fixed, or do we head straight to a dealership and see about trading this thing in!
We decided on the dealership option. Our daughter and son-in-law had told of their good experience at Huffines Kia in the purchase of their Sorrento. My wife had expressed a desire to look at the Kia Soul and so we made our way to Huffines Kia.
When we pulled into the lot, our car was squealing so loud, people literally turned their heads. William came out to meet and we said, we need to see about trading this in and he went to work. 
Without question, the best car buying experience we have ever had! We walked out of there with a brand new 2014 Kia Soul with a unique and different Latte color. My wife loves her Kia!

When it came time to numbers, there was little back and forth.  He came back with a great internet price and with just a few adjustments, I was signing an agreement.  Within a few minutes, we were in Finance and finalizing the deal.  The whole transaction took over just 2 hours and that was only because they were short a finance manager that morning.

1265,"April 02, 2014","Michael was 1st one to respond to my internet query for quotes on Subaru Forester Limited.  In all honesty, it was a better quote than another dealer I had been to see.  Michael was persistent but not ever annoyingly so.  He was always courteous, professional, honest & trying to get me the best deal.  He actually won my business from the other dealership to the tune of $1100 savings on the ""drive out"" price!!
Michael never boasted about that but I sure did!!  He also spoke highly of liking his job & work environment & it showed!!
It's just hard to beat a good, easy-going, comfortable, hometown feel atmosphere.

Of honorable mention is Donna in Finance.  I had secured 1.99% financing for 60 mos with USAA & did not think that could be beat.  She found 1.8% at local credit union!  She, too, glowingly said ""I love my job!"" when asked why would you drive so far to work here? 

To me, these are examples that speak to the integrity of your employees.

Once the model, color and amenity/accessory packages were selected by me, I asked each to submit their dealership's availability and best OTD cash pricing with no trade in. Some shuttled me around to other sales people.  Some began the dreadful ""Let me talk to my sales manager/boss hype.""  Mike Bresnahan and Joey Sparlin (Joseph) at Huffines Subaru were very helpful to simply reply to my requests without hesitation.  No sales games or gimmicks were thrown my way.  They located the vehicle, quoted me a OTD price, explained what they were able to do and could not do, all up front.  Mike promised delivery during my window of time I was bound to if I was willing to commit.  Two other dealers within 30-45 or so miles quoted a lower price, though ignoring the 2 dealer installed accessories I asked for.  Search was over.

Day of purchase and delivery was extremely pleasurable, quick and to the point.  Mike spent as much time needed with instruction to the many electronic functions on the this car...very helpful.

1290,"January 01, 2014","From the first point of contact via the Huffines website to the closing of the sale I can honestly say this has been the best car buying experience I have ever had.  I always dread purchasing a new vehicle because of the hard sale tactics employed by most car dealers.  Usually the entire experience is exceptionally stressful and I would rather avoid it.  However, Huffines Subaru did not go overboard trying to force a sale on me and made the entire experience pleasant.  I would highly recommend this dealership to others, especially those like me that would prefer to just get in, make the deal, and be done with it without all of the gimics and games that usually go along with a vehicle purchase.",5.0
1291,"December 30, 2013","I had been shopping and searching reviews of cars online, and found some excellent reviews of the Kia Forte.  I met Will when I came to Huffines Kia Denton, and was comfortable with his manner and information offered in the models I wanted to look at.  I was impressed with the car and Will made me a great deal! ",5.0
1292,"December 25, 2013","I had been on the internet looking at vehicles, I was initially contacted by Mr. Eckert via email then a phone call.  He sounded very professional and interested in helping me.  I made an appointment with him.  (I had also planned to visit another dealership). After I arrived, I was assisted by Mr. Gomes, who is personable and professional, and very knowledgeable about the vehicle I was interested in.  Because of my interactions with him and the general atmosphere in the dealership, I decided that I would not be going to the other dealership if Huffines could assist me, even though the other dealership had promised 10% less than the deal I would get anywhere.  I have received my new car, and am happy with my decision so far.  Am waiting to hear from staff regarding my appointment for the protectant to be applied.",4.8

1295,"December 20, 2013","When I purchsed my first Kia in 2005 it was a great experience and I never felt like I was wasting my time. Now that my Kids have grown I didn't need a big car anymore so Itook my Sportage back to Huffines Kia and William McGraw was great. He met me when I exited the car, not like he was hovering there waiting or anything like that. He asked what I thaught aboutmy Sportage and I told him it was a great vehicle but I wanted something smaller, he was right there to answer all my questions, showed me the different cars and let me decide on what I wanted. I decieded on a Red Kia Rio and the service I recieved was the best. He is great to talk to (we talked about all sorts of things, not just Kias) He is very friendly and I will remain a Kia customer.

1297,"December 17, 2013","I have to say this was the most laid back, easy going, no stress expierience I've ever had in buying a car! Jerry was very nice and friendly to work with. He was not pushing or pressuring me one bit. Very little negotiating was needed, I asked for a certain price range and they delivered. I am very pleased with the their first offer and the rest of the process went just as smooth. No suprises, no games. Since my credit was not stellar, I didn't think I could get a very good intrest rate but the finance department approved me for a rate that was better than I was hoping for. This made me very happy. The car I wanted was not on the lot so they worked their magic and set up for a trade with another dealership that did have the car I wanted. It only took half a day to get it delivered. Since it was a bit earier than expected, Jerry offered to come pick me up from home and drive me back to the dealership so that I could take my new car home that evening. It's little details like this that really impressed me. Overall very friendly and easy to talk to group of professionals. I would do buisness again with this group.",5.0

1300,"December 08, 2013"," My experience at Huffines Kia Subaru Denton was painless. Of course, I had to do some haggling to get the payment where I wanted it, but I got it there. I purchased a 2010 Mazda 6, beautiful! One owner, 17,000 miles. I had three days to return it. During that time I requested the Carfax and it was faxed to me the same day. Carfax report came back clean. I took the car to get checked out by a mechanic, great condition, no problems. Buying a car in general isn't a great experience, feels like you're selling your soul. So overall it was a good experience. I would recommend this dealership to friends and family!!     ",4.8
1301,"December 01, 2013","After reviewing Subaru Outback, I knew that was the car that I wanted. Several of my Colorado family members own an Outback. I met with Michael Raupp and we looked at a few Outbacks and their options as well as The Forester. I was impressed with both and almost changed my mind on the Outback. Michael was extremely knowledgeable and gave me great information. I decided on the car and color and there was one in transit. I wasn't in any hurry. However, I felt my trade in was a little low. After several days had passed, and several calls and emails, the perfect price was struck.The car arrived well within ETA and I met with Michael and we went over all the last details along with meeting Donna, a lovely lady who wrapped up the paperwork. I was pleased with the price, the service and the professionalism that Michael put forth. Good experience overall. Thanks Michael, I really enjoy my new Outback!",5.0
1302,"November 15, 2013","Looking at the reviews online, it looks all good about the dealership. But i had the worst experience of my life for buying anything. The internet sales guy was good and polite, but i guess he lacks knowledge about cars. May be he has good knowledge of KIA and Subaru, but since i had bought a used VW, he did not have much clew about this car. Also his communication was very poor, coz i would call him or send him an email, and he wouldnt answer what i asked him, and ask me a question back. i had to send several repeat emails to get my questions answered.
When i went and looked at the car, everything was good, we did a test drive and everything was perfect, no complaints. Just a minor problem with the sun glass holder, which wasnt locking properly, and would open with some vibration while driving. So i asked the internet sales guy to get it fixed before delivery (which was atleast 10 days time). when i got the delivery, i asked him if that was fixed, to which i was told that it was fixed. But while driving back home, from the dealership, it opened again with some vibration, and since then its not closing properly. So that was either not fixed or not fixed properly.
There was another situation, which i would say was my mistake as well, that i didnt check the rear view camera, while doing the test drive. so the next day after the test drive i looked it up online, at the dealership website, and it said that the car does have a rear view camera. And that too not in one place, but 4 different places. So i was sure that it would be there and it would be working. But just to double check, i sent an email to the internet sales guy to find out about the sun glass holder, and to check if the rear view camera is working or not. So as usual, he didnt answer my questions and started asking his questions, like whats ur bank and what us SSN, etc.. After a few emails back and forth, i asked him again, what about the sun glass holder and rear view camera. then he replied saying the sun glass holder is fixed, and there is no RVC. To which i replied to him saying i was not happy with this, as the description says it does have a RVC, and its says at 4 different places on the website. To which he replied back saying, sorry, there is a RVC installed. So i was relieved and asked him to check if it is working or not. To which he replies, sorry there is no RVC. I mean this guy didnt know what he was doing. Later when i explained him, that false information was posted on the website, and thats not acceptable. To which he tells me that even though it says on the our website, there is fine print below it saying that everything mentioned above is not accurate. I mean this is how you sell as car? You show all the fancy features of the car in bold and highlighted, and at the bottom, just mention in a fine print that all the above details are not accurate... thats it?
The worst experience came when i was making the deal with the manager. When i first looked at the price online, i contacted the internet sales guy to give me a final sale price. He gave me a good price (lets say XXXXX) and i was happy, and i told him, that it was very close to my price range, and we can negotiate it once we make the deal. So i went there after a week, to make the deal, and i saw that they had reduced the internet price by $200. So while negotiating with the internet sales guy, i told him that i should atleast get a $200 off, which was they have done for the online price too. So he asked me to wait while he discusses this with his manager. So the manager showed up in the office, and he comes and says ""Today is Saturday, and i m very very busy, i have a lot of other things to do, so if u like this price, then sign it, or else thank you very much."" these were is exact words. Even he sounded very rude, and  the most unfriendly sales guy i have ever met. But still, since i liked the car, i was trying to negotiate and explain him that its they reduced the price online, and it should be reduced for me too, but again he repeated the same thing, i m very busy today, and if you want it, take it at this price or leave it. I was really not happy with way he was treating me. I have been in the US less than a month, and i m not familiar with the car buying processes here, so i had called up my friends, who drove all the way from Houston to help me buy a car. And they were really really angry with what was going on, and almost  left, coz they didnt like the attitude of this manager. They told me that if they were in my place, they would leave right away, but since i was in a desperate situation, i had to get one immediately,since without a car you can go anywhere here in the US. So after all that humiliation, just for the $200, i still signed the deal. But i was really not happy with that guy. I m new to the US, and i was thinking people here in the US are very friendly, and i was right, the people here are very friendly and very supportive, but this guy blew me off. This is not a way to talk to people and specially when you are a sales guy, and this is not the way you treat your customers. If this was not my first car, and if i was not in a desperate position to buy the car right away, i would have walked out immediately. 
To sum it up, i still think that the dealership might be good, as the other reviews say, but my experience was horrible, and based on that i wouldnt recommend anyone going there, coz there are people who dont know how to talk to customers. The internet sales guy was polite buy i guess he lacked knowledge and skills and his communication was also very poor. But the worst guy was that manager, who is the worst person i have ever met, till date.
I usually never put up ratings online, for any products or services, but i wanted this one to be noticed, and people to be aware of these people",1.6

I found the the exact vehicle at Huffines Subaru Dealership in Texas and called them to see about buying the car from them. My experience could not have been any better then if I was right in front of them. My salesman, Jerry Paredes, worked  very hard Joey Sparlin and Edwin Homan to get me all the information on the car and got me a trade-in price for my car. Brad Chambess did all the paperwork and was very friendly. I have bought a lot of vehicles in my 71 years and this was the best I have EVER been treated...and I was expect it to be much more difficult doing it ""on line"".

1308,"October 17, 2013","I am writing this review after trying to strike a deal with Sewell Subaru of Dallas and Subaru of Plano. Save yourself a lot of time and just visit Huffines Subaru/Kia of Denton. Huffines Subaru/Kia of Denton provided the best deal on the Forester we were looking at leasing, the most genuine and friendly staff who didn't come across as patronizing or condescending once during the whole interaction. I felt like they wanted my business and even though Rob wasn't able to sit with me the day it came to purchasing, my girlfriend felt most comfortable and trusting with him. Rob introduced me to Zak, as he didn't want me to wait longer than I had to, and Zak was very personable displaying his desire to advocate for me as his client. During the discussions around financing they were very patient, forthcoming, and set the appropriate expectations. I checked all the calculations and there were no mistakes or hidden items; they even informed me of details the prior dealerships were not sharing with me about how the application was being handled. The whole process took less time than I anticipated and Grant Wilson went over my contract and signing making it very simple, easy, and went over all the details according to my timeline; I was allowed the time to ask questions and read everything I wanted to without any negative non-verbal communication on his part. On their own, Huffines Subaru/Kia of Denton deserves a rating of great in all the categories for the aformentioned details as well as remembering details from my girlfriend's prior experience (i.e. the floormats she preferred and giving free Subaru pop-up bowls for our dog to drink and eat out of when on the road). My final note though, in comparison to Sewell Subaru of Dallas where I was told ""I don't know why you came then,"" when I tried to start a conversation about the payments being a little high, and Subaru of Plano where my girlfriend was told ""no offense to you, becuase I know you did your research, but I'm going to call Bull$***"" when she was sharing details about the prices she was mentioning discovered at other dealerships, Huffines Subaru/Kia of Denton deserves a much higher rating in each category. The only reason we ventured about dealerships other than Huffines Subaru/Kia of Denton was because they didn't have the exact car she wanted on their lot, so I am extremely grateful we got to work with them in the end when a car matching the one my girlfriend was interested in appeared on their lot. Save yourself from wasting a whole lot of time and just work with Huffines Subaru/Kia of Denton instead of going to the other two dealerships I mentioned. I am partial to Rob and Zak given my experience, so of course, I suggest you ask for one of them. ",5.0
1309,"October 09, 2013","You should consider buying or having your car serviced at another establishment.  I was sold a car from Huffines Subaru with an obvious defect.  I was told it could be fixed no problem.  While waiting for the part to come in I noticed the car running funny and requested that it be looked at while the dash is replaced.   When I got my new car back it was wanting to stall and the check engine light was now coming on.  They were closed so I left a message.  I never got a call back.  I then noticed that when they washed the car that whatever they used to clean the car had put small scratches all over the car from front to back thus ruining the paint job.  When I finally spoke to someone after having to call up to the dealership, they were not able to resolve my issue.  I asked that the GM please call me and am still waiting 2 days later.  This was our first family vehicle purchase and it has been a nightmare.  If you purchase here you will be an afterthought after you have driven off the lot.  I highly recommend that you take your hard earned money to another business that will appreciate it and you!",1.8

1313,"September 29, 2013","My husband and I went to Huffines Kia in Denton to look for a pre-owned Kia Soul we had seen on the computer.  As we stopped in the parking lot, Bryan Buckhanan immediately met us.  When we told him about the car, he invited us in and began the search for it.  We were mistaken and the car was actually at another location.  Bryan quickly offered to go get it and bring it down for us the next day.  In the meantime, he found an identical Soul for us to test drive.  There was no pressure whatsoever.  Bryan just calmly and efficiently answered our questions.  When we got back to the store and his office, he began crunching numbers and found a way for us to buy a brand new Kia Soul for just a little more.  He even went to that other location to drive down the one in the color I wanted.  I may never know all the ways that Bryan went the extra mile for us, but I know this:  I LOVE my car and when my family needs another one, we'll go first to Huffines Kia in Denton and ask for Bryan.

1315,"September 25, 2013","Just within the Month of September I had the pleasure of working with Andrew Gomes on the purchase of two Kia's. The first being a Kia Soul for a buddy of mine,  The situation was very unique and after explaining everything to Andrew, he listened not as a salesman but a caring man and worked with my buddy to get him into the vehicle and the color he had wanted for several years.  Even after the purchase he followed up on the car and the personal situation of my Buddy.  His professionalism and kind and understanding personality made the purchase very worthwhile and very memorable. 

Because of Andrew being the man he is I had no problems returning to him when I was ready to trade in my existing vehicle barely two weeks later. I dropped by and met with him just on the spur of the moment while at lunch one afternoon and gave him some brief information and when I arrived that following Saturday all we had to do was look a few Sorento's and I was sold.  Andrew made sure the vehicle was everything I wanted right down to the Fog lights.  Through the entire process Andrew kept me informed of what was going on with the paperwork and made my buying experience very relaxing and enjoyable.  I highly recommend Andrew to anyone who may be looking or even just thinking about buying a KIA from this dealership. He is very knowledgable about his products and answered the majority of my questions before I even asked them. I think of Andrew not just as the man who sold me a car but after talking about life outside the dealership I now think of him as a very good friend.   Thank you Andrew !!!",5.0

1318,"September 18, 2013","I bought a new Kia Soul in 2010 and loved everything from the service I was given by Bryan Buckhanan to the new vehicle itself. I felt that I was taken very good care of and Bryan even taught me how to drive the manual transmission, I loved it. Earlier this year I went in to trade in my 2010 for a 2013 Kia Soul - Brett Clark took very good care of me and got me in to a car that I completely love. I have no issues with the sales people - at all. Very friendly, professional and willing to help.. as someone who has worked in customer service industries before, I truly appreciate that.

When I traded in my car the finance personnel told me that I would be receiving a Gap Cancellation refund for my previous vehicle, that it took 6 weeks to process and that the check would be mailed to me. I came in to get my license plates about 6 weeks after the trade in and the front desk lady told me that I should be getting that check in 2 weeks. Two weeks later I called to speak with someone in finance. I have currently talked to 3 different people in the finance department: Brent, Grant & someone else who I have unfortunately forgotten her name. Brent and the lady were very kind and helpful, although neither one of them followed up or returned my phone calls. My last interaction was with Grant who I found to be unpleasant and slightly condescending.. but at least he followed up and returned my phone call. However, he did make me feel like I was being difficult and a general pain in his work. 

It has been 11 weeks since I have traded in my vehicle and I was just told today that it was my fault for not cancelling my Gap Insurance on the previous vehicle and  that it will take an additional 6-8 weeks to process - but not to worry because they have done everything they can do for me including putting a rush on the processing. I think the best way for this to not happen again is to explain the process a little bit better to the customer and have them fill out the cancellation at the time of sale (which I thought I had done). Apparently I filled it out on Sept 11... have not been in the dealership since the beginning of August. Seems like some paper work errors occurred somewhere.

I never write reviews online because I usually do not feel it necessary - however, this is extremely frustrating and someone should know about it before considering doing finance options with Huffines Kia in Denton.",3.2

We did not receive as much for our trade in as we had hoped, but the advantages of Subaru and the dealership were more than enough to overcome this.

It is our opinion that the dealership sold us a car with alignment problems.  We contacted our salesman the following Monday morning when they were open, and he indicated we should bring the car in, and it would take about 1.5 hours to check the alignment, unless they found something wrong.  He also stated that because the car had been delivered to the dealership on a trade from Missouri, that trailering could have caused the issue if the car was winched down to tight.   I told him I would bring the car by a little after 3:00 p.m. so they could look at the alignment. 

I arrived at the dealership and was directed to the service department.  The service advisor was told about the car's pulling to the right, and stated he needed an entire day to do the work.  He then indicated he wanted to test drive it, and proceeded to check the air pressure.  He then test drove the vehicle, and indicated he could find absolutely no problem with the alignment.  I asked him if he or his tech would get paid for the work or reimbursed by Subraru, and he said not on something like this.  I asked him what was the chance of him finding a problem if he could not detect it on the test drive and he indicated 'very low.'  He stated that the Outback could not have its camber or caster adjusted, only the toe in.  I told him our salesman had indicated that it could have had the issue caused during the trailering.  He stated, ""I have never heard that.""  I again asked if he could at least check the toe in, and asked why that would take all day?  ""Bring it back tomorrow, we open at 7 a.m.""  I told him it was very obvious that he did not want to find a problem, that he had not even looked under the car to see if there was evidence of any trailer damage or any other cause.  I indicated that it appeared that I would have to take the car to another alignment shop.  I made sure he understood that we had driven four other Outbacks on test drives, none of which pulled to the right like this car.  I told him I was familiar with the crown of the road causing a pull, and told him that we should drive it on a flat surface.  He asked where we could find one.  He kept his left hand on the wheel to compensate for the right pull almost the entire test drive.   To be clear this car pulls slightly to the right regardless of driving on a road surface that crowns slightly LEFT.  If the wheel is left unattended, the car will move right at a much greater rate than caused by the crown, and the driver has to place an additional amount of unnecessary and constant attention on the wheel to prevent this.  

The overall impression I got from my experience with the service advisor:

* He was not interested in finding a problem, and ignored the car's pulling to the right, blaming it on the road crown.
* He was not interested in putting the car on an alignment machine, and indicated that there was 'very little' he could/would do.  Remember, he was not getting paid.  
* He did not seem truly interested in my satisfaction with the vehicle or his service, and made it clear that if he could not find a problem, then the chance of his shop fixing it was small.
* The service advisor looked me in the eye and told me that both camber and caster could NOT be adjusted on the front of my vehicle, only toe in could be adjusted.  A quick check with Subura Technical Subscription for the 2014 Outback reveals that he is incorrect.  Camber can be adjusted on my vehicle, as can many other variables to impact alignment, including steering angle, front and rear toe in, and thrust angle. 

Keep in mind this is the experience we had at Huffines on a Monday, after spending over $36,000 on a new car two days earlier.

When we were trying to figure out the ""where to buy from"" question we knew huffines prides each dealership on its Integrity, Honesty and Customer Service. So we thought we knew what to expect from a visit to one of their locations. However not only did they live up to their expectations, they far exceeded them. Phillip Vivar was the first Gentleman we encountered and he truly ensured that our experience was the very definition of exemplary. We came to find out later that he wasn't a sales rep, but a manager getting in the trenches and taking care of his customers from the bottom up! He referred us to a gentleman by the name of Darwin Gibson a 7 year sales rep with an amazing amount of knowledge on pretty much everything. He knew every detail from new tech to the workings behind the GDI power train. This salesman truly set the standard on customer service at every angle. There was no pressure to buy and simply put we were treated as family. To top it all off we brought our VERY HIGH ENERGY 3 year old with us and they knew exactly how to handle any curve ball we or ""he"" threw. They played with him and brought out all sorts of toys. As I stated earlier we were treated ""like family"".  Any car buyer would be truly shocked to see how Huffines Kia of Denton has transformed the buying experience into desirable, exciting and memorable moments that you truly want to tell others about.

Thanks again Huffines Family!

Phil, the sales Mgr. was helpfull, and encouraged us to find the car we wanted.
Other folks, were also very effective--Donna on the financing, other sales rep. making sure we were being helped when Alex was busy getting  the car to look at , etc..
The post negotiations paperwork process is not effiecient. It seems redundant , doesn't effectively use technology--for the sales and admin. team. It should be reviewed and updtaed.

There was no pressure as you might expect to see at a car dealership, and their knowledge base was very good regarding their products.  It all started with a newer salesman, Mr. Buckhanan.  He was very new to this and had limited knowledge of the technical aspects of Subaru.  Myself, having been a Subaru mechanic many years ago, naturally I asked very specific and detailed questions regarding the changes to Subaru.  Mr. Buckhanan respectfully brought me to the people that could answer the questions, thus resulting in the information I needed and ultimately a purchase of a new car.

1359,"May 08, 2013","Shortly after submitting my requirements for a Subaru Outback using an online car buying service the first dealership representative to call was Dale Rhoades of Huffines Kia-Subaru in Denton. Dale did not have a car that matched my needs in stock and offered to place a factory order. In the days to come I would learn that no other dealership in 4 surrounding states did either.

There were 4 dealerships much closer to our home as Denton is 50 miles away. I used 2 for test drives and all 4 to start the negotiation for a factory order. My goal was to do as much negotiation as possible from home. Of these 4 one went out of business, another ""offered"" what appeared to be a fantastic deal but never responded when I asked for specifics, a third was incapable of ordering the car with the options that I wanted and the fourth made a competitive effort providing specific answers I needed to make a purchase.

In the end Dale won our business with his best price and honest effort to work with us to get a great deal. We finally made our first trip to Denton this past weekend to pickup the Outback and I can best summarize the overall experience with a quote taken from an email Dale sent shortly after our very first telephone conversation:

Not only did I get a GREAT deal on Kia Optima but Rick got me pre-approved before I even stepped into the dealership. It was so nice walking in knowing that I wouldn't be turned down.

I knew from various radio ads that Huffine's had a sterling reputation, so I was confident that everything spelled out in the quote I received from Tim Spencer was true and accurate, from the low mileage on the vehicle to the laundry list of options and features to the very reasonable price. When my son, Sean, and I arrived at the dealership, Tim had the car ready for Sean to test drive immediately. Needless to say, Sean was very impressed with the car and so was I. Even more impressive, however, was the outstanding customer service we received from Tim and also from Grant Wilson. Every step in the process was explained clearly and in detail. I debated with myself about purchasing the additional warranty items (extended bumper-to-bumper warranty, service plan, road hazard, ding repair and that miracle paint protector I can't remember the name of), but ended up deciding to take the whole package. It's probably money I didn't need to spend, but I never felt pressured by Grant to buy anything I didn't want. He did a good job of outlining the benefits of the various protections and I like knowing that if something goes wrong with the car, it's covered by one plan or another. We moms with teenage drivers need all the peace of mind we can get! Everyone we encountered at Huffine's Kia Subaru Denton was friendly and kind, but Tim especially went out of his way -- literally -- to help us get the new car back to our home in Frisco. Sean had not yet obtained his driver's license, so he couldn't drive it and, of course, I would have to drive our family car, which left us with no one to handle the new car. Tim to the rescue! He drove the car back to Frisco for us and then I gave him a ride back to the dealership. This may be standard practice in the car business, but it meant a lot to Sean and me. I would definitely recommend Huffine's Kia Subaru Denton to anyone in the market for a great deal on a great car made by great people. Mr. Huffine should be very proud of his employees, all of whom did their utmost to uphold his sterling reputation -- and looked like they truly loved doing it. Thanks for a great experience. Sincerely, Wendie Grogan",5.0

I made an appointment with Dale over the phone for a test drive.  i wasn't sure that i was ready to buy today, and was never given the hard sale.  From arrival to departure with new keys in hand the entire transaction clocked in at exactly 2.5 hours, and that included two different test drives, the appraisal on my old car all of the financing and Dale walking me through all of the features of my new car.  Dale was warm and friendly to work with, happily answered any questions that i had and made this such a painless experience.  i will definitely be recommending Huffines Subaru Denton to everyone i know!

The financing approval was completed prior to my going to the dealership so I only spent about 15 minutes with Donna Balamonte in Finance finalizing the paperwork.

1422,"November 16, 2012","I took our 2007 Kia Rondo in for maintenance at Huffines Kia, knowing it had over $1K of work to be done on it and was informed that one repair was going to cost far more than we originally thought.  That was pretty much the end.  We were in a situation in which we had a car that we still owed payments on that was going to require a huge amount of work that we couldn't afford all at once.  I don't know, maybe I was WISHING that someone would ask me if I just wanted to trade it in before I even got there. 

 Every time a salesman walked by with a smile and a polite good morning, it was nice.  One, Phil Chaney, stopped and said good morning, then added jokingly that if anyone had more car repairs than they could afford, he'd be glad to sell them a car.  I mentioned:  I told everyone someone would try to sell me a car within five minutes of sitting down.  I already knew what I wanted.  Since they came out, the Kia Soul has been my favorite vehicle to go to from the Rondo.  We went and looked at one, chatted for a bit, then I went back and sat down to await news on the repairs.

Now, a moment to state that I really do trust Huffines Kia.  Their prices are good for maintenance and we literally fled from a horrible experience at Central Kia to trying them out and noting their excellent BBB rating to them and they happily fixed our problems, even though we had not bought our Kia through them.  Repairs after repairs would be needed to get the Rondo up to working order.  I mentioned that I think I'm going to go look at a new car and the employee talking to me encouragingly said I'd get good years out of my current car after the repairs were done.  (But in the meantime, I would be driving a vehicle with a broken window, a timing belt that had just passed replacement date and brakes that needed pads replaced on.)


I opted for less stressful of options and was treated to a visit with Phil again to see if he could sell me a car and get our old car traded in.  This was the best sales experience I've ever had.  It was more like a long casual conversation than the normal fast talking men I had dealt with before.  I did not feel the need to haggle over price.  I know their prices are good and I'm happy with what we ended up with.  Phil was quick to respond to any problems afterward and explain further questions I had.  I highly recommend going to Huffines Kia over any of the others and you should look for Phil.  He did really take care of us down to getting a cute little stuffed hamster for our daughter. :)  Thank you, Huffines Kia, for a good experience that I can feel comfortable with. ",5.0

I can't say enough nice things about Huffines.  Check them out for sure if you are in the market for a new car.  Oh, should add this is our THIRD Kia and they are beyond awesome.  Totally different from the old days.  They are premium cars now and everyone thinks my Optima is a BMW at a glance!  This is our second time buying from Huffines Kia Denton.  ",5.0

I made an appointment with Rick, and it literally was a 30-minute process, title work and all, at the dealership to close the purchase of a 2007 Totota Yarius.  The car was detailed, full of gas, dealer service records were provided, and a CarFax service history was pulled.  Anthony Reich approved my counter offer and the final sale.  I received follow-up phone calls and e-mails to make sure I was satisfied with the deal and their customer service.  You can't ask for anything more!  I definitely will check with Huffines of Denton first for my used car purchases in the future.

1441,"October 13, 2012","I was extremely pleased with my experience at Huffines Subaru. In fact, I drove more than 600 miles to come back to my home state to buy my 2013 Subaru Forester. The dealerships near my current home in Mississippi were not willing to negotiate, nor were they pleasant to work with. Rob Robertson went above and beyond for me, even conversed on his day off, just so that I could get my car! Anthony and Edwin made sure all of the paperwork was completed so that when I drove in, all I had to do was drive off in my new car. Rob came in to work early, so that I could turn around head back home.

My husband has a 2010 Outback, which was actually purchased at a different dealership. We did however start bringing it to the Huffines dealership for service. Everyone is always so nice and the service is very quick. 

I will definitely be telling my friends about my awesome experience at Huffines Kia Subaru and when it comes time for another new car, Rob Robertson is who I will be calling!!!!

1442,"October 06, 2012","I haven't shopped for a new car in over 12 years and was a little reluctant to start looking again.  My last experience had been quite trying and stressful. 

Dealing with Mike was totally unexpected.  Very low key no pressure approach.  I went in thinking I knew what I wanted and after talking to Mike I decided I might want a different vehicle.  Mike explained the attributes and differences of both vehicles and suggested that I test drive both of them so that I could see the difference for myself.  Every question I had Mike had the answers.  I was blown away by the whole process. 

Being old fashioned I decided I needed a day or two to let everything soak in before I made a final decision.  Had tested a few other vehicles and really was totally impressed by the Subarus I test drove but wanted to let it all settle in my mind.  Mike and Edwin both spoke with me and understood my reluctance to move immediately.

Two days later when all aspects were considered, I walked into the Dealership and picked out the car I wanted and took it home that afternoon.  Mike and Edwin both walked me through all aspects of the sale and made it clear and understandable.  I cannot thank both of them enough for a very pleasant and enjoyable process.

We dialed in on two vehicles then declared our intentions to get the truck so ""get the papers ready because if we liked it we were buying it"".  Matt Green took us for our test drive and we liked the truck and decided we had better check out the Kia Sol just for kicks.

Test drove it and loved it!

It was late at night so there we were already keeping Matt Green and Grant Wilson around after hours with papers drawn up and we changed our mind.  No groans or signs just let me get right on that!

Here's the THEN SOME, Grant Wilson calls the next day after the deal is signed and done.  Tells come back in, he got us a BETTER RATE THAN WHAT WE ALREADY AGREED TO!

1445,"September 27, 2012","I never thought it would be so easy to purchase a car and feel so good about it.  Not pressured by multiple appearances with sales manager upon sales manager, Jerry Paredes, the Huffines salesman provided an exceptional test drive of the Subaru Legacy, even taking us through bumpy terrain to experience the true Subaru ride.  Jerry did not attempt to ask the typical leading questions of other dealership sales people such as finances.  He understood the quality of the brand that he was providing and demonstrated the benefits.  Jerry also pointed out areas that Subaru is different and must be taken into consideration when purchasing the vehicle.  Upon mentioning other brands to him that we were looking at, he never provided a negative comment about the competition.

Edwin Holman also great assisting Jerry in making sure we got the right deal at the end.  Then to the finance office that never pressured us into purchasing the unnecessary add ons that drive up the price, but laid out a nice set of options to make our experience with a Subaru easier to manage in the future.

Other dealers gave up after trying one bank when shopping for a loan with my low score. Rick and the team shopped more than 7 to get me a good loan.

The extra initiative that Rick and the team showed is appreciated by my family and myself which landed us in a much needed vehicle of our choosing.

1475,"July 18, 2012","My wife and I are a younger couple, and we were looking for a quality used car on a budget. There were a few dealerships we went to where we were ignored and we felt that age may have been a factor. We were greeted immediately when we came on the lot. Rob was very friendly and helpful in finding us the right car. He was not pressuring at all. He listened to what our needs were, and was patient while we looked at various vehicles. We found one we liked and decided to go inside and talk numbers. At this point, most salesmen have a shift in attitude and become pressuring. Rob maintained his kindness and never pressured us into signing. When we were concerned about the cars reviews and price, so Rob let us use his computer to surf the web and find reviews to make an informed decision. Although I would have liked the vehicle for a little less, we were in dire need of a second car and it was priced fairly. 

When we picked the car up, we were a little disappointed it wasn't fully cleaned. It still had some stuff on the carpets and there was some stuff that needed to be wiped down, but it wasn't bad. When we drove off the lot, the brakes started to squeak so we got a little upset. The next day was very hot, and it rained that afternoon. When we went to drive it after the rain stopped, we noticed a crack in the windshield. It looked like there was a ""star"" that had been attempted to be repaired, but it didn't hold up against the temperature change. I don't believe it was the dealership that attempted to fix it, but I didn't want a cracked windshield. Luckily, Huffines has a 3 day (200 mile) money back guarantee. We decided to go back to the dealership and see if they would work with us on fixing the issues. I was preparing to have to put up a fuss, but when I got there they were very accommodating. Rob called me the next day, and instead of offering to fix the windshield, he told me they had ordered a new one. He also told me they were going to work on the brakes and fix the squeaking. When we picked up the vehicle it was spotless and the squeak wasn't present. The only reason I gave a 4 for the quality of work was because the brakes still make a ""slight"" squeak when we're braking, but its probably because the quality of pads the past owner had on the car weren't the best.

As we zoomed in on the 2012 Optimas we weren't barraged with selling points and frivolous nick nacks. We were offered a test drive. Mr. Gibson's belief that the car sells itself was comforting and refreshing. And the car does sell itself. Upon returning we were told about Kia's warranties and brief descriptions of options and allowed to leave without hassle. Not once did Mr. Gibson talk down other brands and seemed content to let Kia sell itself.
I wanted to take a week or two to make sure this was the car my wife really wanted.  Mr. Gibson didn't blow up cell phone. A courtesy call to tell me he could get the car I wanted.
When I did return to purchase the loaded Spicy Red 2012 Kia Optima EX it was exactly as we wanted it with all the options requested. Perfect.
The money end was a breeze. I was explained optional coverages. Discounts were given and a car was bought. The whole process took maybe an hour. No high pressure tactics/guilt trips to buy extended coverages ( although the maintenance program and tire hazard was too good to pass on).
Came back a few hours later with my wife, had her sign a few papers and Mr. Gibson explained the finer points of the interior controls. He even synched my wife's Blackberry. And we were off.

The Sales Manager had a straightforward manner of doing business.

One big plus was the lack of a ""mop & glow"" sticker on their cars.

I reside 3 miles from a Ft. Worth Kia dealer and the reason I will not do business with them is 

every unit has a $1500 ""mop & glow"" sticker.

I called Huffines Subaru in Denton,Texas Monday morning to be sure the car was still available. I spoke with Jerry Paredes and he assured me it was still available. Over the last few weeks I had made an in-depth research on several different makes and models of cars/SUVs and felt the Forester would most likely meet my needs and desires.

A friend drove me to view the Forester and take it for a test drive. Jerry met us at the door; he was friendly, pleasant and very informative. He immediately went and brought the car to the front door for us take it for a test drive. Jerry demonstrated very good knowledge and understanding of Subaru’s abilities in general and of this Forester in particular. He was patient and yet excited to show and explain the car.   I soon realized it offered everything I was looking for and several extras not considered. 

In all ways Jerry was very professional;and when I made the firm decision to buy,he directed me to Edwin Homan who assisted with the paperwork and processing. The next team member was the Finance Manager Grant Wilson. Grant worked with me to complete the paperwork and processing. He was also very professional and knows how to perform his part of the process in a fast and complete manor. It was just a matter of a few hours and I drove my Subaru Forester home.

At age 73 years, I expect to be in charge of my purchase and not the salesman. The sale worked out for both of us. I got an excellent vehicle at a good price, and David got his sale.
On the evening I brought my wife up to check out the Subaru, Dale Rhoades did an excellent job standing in for David who was off that night.

1496,"May 23, 2012"," On 2/25/12 my wife and I purchased a 2012 Kia Soul from Huffines Kia which was represented to us as a new car. During completion of the sale, we were told that the car had over 500 miles on it. We reluctantly accepted the car as it was and were told that we would be given a $100 refund due the fact that the car was actually a demo. My wife and I became increasingly upset over this deception and the next day I contacted the general manager of Huffines Kia, Robert Goodwin, who apologized for the deception and said they would find us a new car with the same features. Within a couple of days, he contacted me and said they had found a replacement. My wife and I went to the dealership and we exchanged the vehicles. When we got home, we found out that this car had no rear bumper applique, no auto dimming mirror with compass and not pinstripes. This was $624 in options which we had paid for and not received. I informed Robert Goodwin about this and again he said they would make it right. He indicated they would order the parts and let me know when the individual who did these installations was at the dealership, which he did, and we set up a day to do the installation. My wife became ill and was in the hospital the day we had agreed upon installing the options and I had to cancel, informing Robert Goodwin that morning. On March 9, he said that was fine and he would let me know the next time the individual set to do the installation would be available. On the morning of March 20, I contacted Robert Goodwin again to find out why he had not gotten back with me regarding the installation. Since my initial attempt to purchase this car, they misrepresented a demo as a new car and misrepresented the replacement car as having the same options as the original. After I complained to the Better Business Bureau, they refunded my money for the options that I did not get. Jerry Paredes was dishonest with us from beginning to end.",2.5

1531,"December 16, 2011","Update: After seeing the below post the General Manager contacted me.  It appears there was a break down in communication from his staff and he was unaware I was still unhappy.  He worked with me to come to a much more reasonable resolution by increasing the amount they reimbursed me and by providing me with documentation of the repairs that were made.  They also agreed to guarantee the repair work for as long as I own the vehicle.

Not Trustworthy. I purchased a new Subaru from them only to find out it had been damaged prior to me purchasing it. The only reason I found out is because I was talking to Corporate Subaru about the guaranteed trade in value and they told me about the damage. The dealer tries to play it off that it is just a door and was only around $400, but they sold me a damaged car as brand new. A car that I would not have purchased had I known about the damage and repair. They then offered to give me a $400 check. That discount wouldn't have been enough to affect my purchase decision.

I was met with apologies and a renewed effort to help me, which had not happened previously.  The finance manager and sales managers took me under their wings and made sure my needs were met.  Within 24 hours, they had worked out financing, found me another vehicle that fit my needs even more perfectly, and made me feel like a valued customer.

1546,"September 15, 2011","I had never driven a Subaru before 2002... We stopped by the Huffines Subaru in Lewisville in January 2002.  We got the test drive of our life.  I never knew a car could do all the things I saw, especially driving up dirt hills.  I was sold ... after my heart stopped racing :)  That Forester was just a fun car and we drove it to the top of Pike's Peak just after the car turned 100,000 miles.  It also saved my life just a few months after I purchased it when I hit a car that ran a red light.  My car had some bumper and exhaust damage, but the car I hit and the one that hit me from behind both had to be towed away from the scene.

In 2010, when we needed another car to accomodate driving teenagers, we did some window shopping at Huffines Subaru in Denton.  I emailed Mike the next day.  Over the next several hours, we exchanged a series of emails.  He sent me a list what they had for used and new cars.  Nothing seemed to match except one used 2009 Subaru Forester, but it was listed as a manual transmission. I wrote back saying it was nice, but manual.  He wrote back almost immediately saying that was a mistake and it WAS an automatic transmission.  I was very interested now.  When he told me it also had a sunroof, I was ready to make the sale.  Other than the test drive, everything was done via the phone and email.  All I had to do was to show up, sign the paperwork and drive off in the new car.  I got the 2009 Forester, and my son began driving the 2002 Forester. 

Fast forward 7 months later in Fall 2010 and we found ourselves window shopping at Huffines Subaru in Denton (again). We had a Ford Edge that we had purchased in August 2008, for all the wrong reasons.  We knew we needed to get rid of the Edge - lots of gadgets but bulky and I missed feeling the road as I drove. Plus we wanted something that would be very reliable for a new college student.  Our 3rd Subaru was added to our family - a two-tone Subaru Impreza Outback Sport.  

Soon it will be time to make the family complete and add a 4th Subaru to the family.  When that day arrives, I know who the first (and only) car salesperson I will call will be - Mike.  He makes car buying fun!

As a side note - our 2009 Subaru Forester just passed its driving test by driving to the top of Pike's Peak in Colorado (14,110 feet) in August 2011.  It was definitely a way to test your car's limits.  The car did just fine!!",5.0

We would gladly refer him to friends and family! ",5.0

1561,"May 09, 2011","Mike Bresnahan made everything easy for me with the great price.  I was buying one of cheapest cars on the lot, but he treated me well without any car sales talks.  As a good consumer, I did my research and contacted several dealerships.  No one could match their price to Mike's number.  While I was doing my research, Mike was very patient without putting any pressure on me, and once I was ready to buy, everything went smoothly, painlessly and quickly.  Also, I was expecting some sales talk on various protections etc., but Mike did not push any of those items.  He mentioned what was available, but once I said that I was not interested, he was ok with my answer.  Then, I spent only 5 min in the finance office.  I did not need any financing, but it was so quick with Brad Chamless that I was bit surprised.  I will recommend Mike to any of my friends.  Both service and price were great.     ",5.0
1562,"April 30, 2011","I are giving this dealership a ""Great"" rating because it IS a great dealership and deserves it.  My wife and I worked primarily with Mike Bresnahan and found him very responsive to our questions and schedule.  Tim Spencer was very helpful during the test drive and Edwin Homan was especially patient introducing me to the different Subaru models. My wife and I were not rushed to purchase a new car.  Our questions were answered thoroughly and none were considered ""dumb"" questions.  The dealership was clean, there was plenty of parking, the selection of vehicles from which to choose was good.  We were not rushed to make a decision and when it came time to buy, the paperwork process was smooth.  When we picked up our new car, it was clean, ready to go.  The purchase of our 2011 Subaru Legacy was the most pleasant car purchase experience I have had.  I look forward to a long relationship with this dealership.  Consider my wife and I very satisfied customers.",5.0
1563,"April 25, 2011","The Subaru Outback I just purchased was actually my 3rd vehicle through Edwin. The previous two were from him as pre-owned, the Subaru was the first new one. Here's my thing with car shopping: I want to do all of it from my desk before stepping foot in the dealership. Any dealer unwilling to deal price via email communication is a non-starter in my book. With all 3 vehicles, Edwin was able and willing to talk price before I even test drove. The first negotiation was a little bit of back and forth, the second one not so much, and by the third one both Edwin and I knew that he was going to give me the best that the dealer was willing to deal. I liked that. The other credit to Edwin is his non-aggressive behavior. He gives used car and new cars salesman a GOOD name, he does not fit the stereotype. I kind of strung him along while I was deciding what I wanted to do, and he never lashed out or tried to put the pressure on me. Hopefully I'm done vehicle shopping for quite a few years, but Edwin will be the first guy I look to shop with when it's time to get another (hopefully not until my oldest starts driving :) )",5.0

He worked very hard to make sure that everything was right about the deal, and has been excellent in following up after the sale.

We were greeted immediately upon arrival at the dealership, but we didn't feel like we were stalked like we have experienced elsewhere.  Mike showed us the vehicle we were interested in, was very thorough in his knowledge, but when he didn't have an answer to a question, he didn't make one up, he asked his manager and returned promptly with an answer.  Everyone we met was very friendly, including Grant, the Finance guy (which isn't what I have experienced in the past at other dealerships).  We purchased a barely used vehicle, which the dealership offered at an incredible price for only having 450 miles on it.  Our overall experience was very stress-free!

When we first talked with the team at Huffines, I mentioned that we really hadn't seen what we wanted, but they had one close and asked about price.  Immediately, they looked for exactly what we wanted, found one at another dealer, and came right back with a great deal.  We had a unique trade in situation, but they also worked very hard to get the best trade in price possible.  Long story short, a limited edition tiger package came in and we ended up with it.
