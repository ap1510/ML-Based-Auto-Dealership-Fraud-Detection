0,"February 20, 2020","I bought a $50,000 Jeep three weeks ago. It typically, from other dealers, takes 2-3 weeks for license plates to arrive. since I have not received the plates after three weeks I called to check on them. I was told that it takes 8-10 weeks, and sometimes longer “depending on the model”. Both statements are total lies! The degrading laughter from the salesman was an insult. ",1.0

3,"June 25, 2019","Worst service department ever!!! 2nd time coming in for a recall and the first time you took my vehicle in and after making me wait over an hour you came and told me you don't have the part in stock. 

Last week I made another service appointment specified I was coming in for the recall, I called yesterday at 4:37 to verify that you had the part and was told yes. I showed up today and you took my vehicle in for the recall and then after an hour and half you come out and tell me you again don't have the part??

Really? Your service people are not competent enough to check parts status before taking a vehicle in twice now?

I called to ask for Allan McBain as I was given his names the service manager and I was transferred to a number that rang then went back to the same call taker and explained that I would like to leave a message for Allan and she hung up on me!!!


Avoid this dealership and service department!!",1.0

5,"October 27, 2018","We had a really bad experience at this dealership. First, their Floor Sales Manager wouldn’t honor their own internet discount that was offered to me in-writing by their Internet Sales Manager. He tried to tell me it was already rolled into the sales price of the vehicle, then when he couldn't make the math work in their favor, it was quickly decided he “had already cut too deep into the price of the vehicle to allow the use of this discount.” Also, be careful of the $1,495.00 package they will tack onto your vehicle for interior Scotchgarde, paint sealant, tire locks, and VIN etching. This is not listed on their website and is added on when you are doing your final invoicing and it will not be optional. The same Sales Manager handling our deal told us “the car could not leave the lot without it.” Then, when I asked for him to provide, in-writing, what was a part of this package he told my wife and myself that “ALL new cars get it” and that “his Finance department was too busy to be bothered with providing it.” Once the deal was finally hammered out and I was given the aforementioned package for $700.00, which by the way was only VIN etching, there was no true delivery of the car; the make ready was so lackluster I had the local car wash down the street finish it a few days later and none of the car’s features were explained to me. Furthermore, when I asked for the spare keys and owner’s manuals, I was told I had to wait until my plates came in and at that time I would be given those items, per dealership policy. When I emailed the salesman about this he said he would check with his GM to see what he could do. I was allowed to drop by a couple days later and pick them up. Do not sign the delivery paperwork until you have truly taken delivery of the vehicle, thoroughly inspected your new purchase and are given a proper run through of all the vehicles features, even though they will try and have you do it beforehand. Dodge was notified during my customer satisfaction survey of these problems as I have them all documented.",1.0
6,"October 05, 2018","I bought two trucks in 2010 from North Star and got a GREAT deal and their service dept is far superior to any other I have used in the city. I have had Ford and Jordan Ford was good but nothing like North Stars caring attitude. The service dept has offered many discounts and has always got me home when I had to leave it and picked me up when it was ready from their porters to their service advisors they are the best in the city. Their caring attitude alone puts them over the top!! I highly recommend them even if you do not buy from them their mechanics and service center is the best!! As the man says ""TRY IT YOU WILL LIKE IT! Leo Charvez the GM prides himself on hiring the best and putting them in the right job. I have known Leo since 2010 and he prides himself on being trustworthy, and people oriented person. JUST A GREAT GUY! Give them a try you will never get it serviced anywhere else.

7,"September 29, 2018","I came into this dealership set on just looking. My decision to buy was not changed bye the salesman but by his knowledge of every question I had about the vehicle. Any questions he did not have an answer to he searched out that answer and came back and informed me. Coming into the dealership I analyze in my own mind how the place looks the demeanor of the salesman and the condition of the service facility. There are two types of service facilities one that you pay for through the price of the vehicle and another one that is functional and is actually a service facility. This service facility at this dealership is a very functional one, it actually looks like a shop. Jared libhart was my salesman and I do recommend him to anyone who may go to this dealership. As far as the finance manager Max answered every question and concern I had in detail and also through working with him was able to even lower the percentage rate from what he originally had. They will take care of you and be straightforward with you which meant a lot to me.",5.0
8,"September 22, 2018","I don't know where to even begin with this review but all i have to say DO NOT I MEAN DO NOT PURCHASE A VEHICLE HERE!!! Worst customer service I've  ever received especially coming from the General Manager Leo Chairez!! He has no remorse,no care or no compassion what so ever for his customers!! Even after I told him what had happened to me with my ""NEW 2019 JEEP CHEROKEE"" on the freeway. He had the audacity to tell me oh that is a easily fixable issue. I was on the freeway when my brand new vehicle just stalled on me!! Luckily it was a Sunday and not much traffic on the freeway because if not i probably wouldn't even be here to be able to write this review but again the General Manager Leo Chairez made it seem like there was really no big Issue!!! I bought this vehicle In the end of June and barely have at the moment over 2000 miles on it and I already encountered not just one but two issues with it and no its not just a small issue. This issue could've clearly taken my life or others if it would've been a week day with a lot of traffic. I never write reviews but buyers please be aware!!! AND BUY ELSEWHERE!!! Because if your brand new car were to break down on you trust me this Dealership does not care and will do nothing to help you out!! All they care about is making the sale and getting paid!! And once they have their money if anything happens to your vehicle they do not want to take any responsibility on that piece of xxxx they just sold you!! Cause that is exactly what i bought from them!! A BRAND NEW PIECE OF xxxx!!!",1.0

10,"June 16, 2017","Too bad there is not zero stars.  Always beware when you see a small lot with 20 salesmen.  They sold me a car and then did not have the car they sold me.  They then tried to have me pay more to get the same car in a color I didn't want.  Beware if they tell you to go to carmax for your trade in!  It is just a way for them to not have an obligation to give you back your trade in when they do not honor their part of the deal. They are not legally bound to honor the sale paperwork so yes they can sell you a car that has already been sold to get their hands on your money (bait) then change the car having you feel obligated to accept what you are given that you didn't want (switch). I literally went to a lawyer thinking this was illegal, its not in Texas. Also military beware they will try to up sale 1500 dollars on the USAA price stating that you do not qualify for your rebates.  The only qualification for military rebates is being military active duty. There are other reviews from USAA members complaining of this.  If you still decide to go stay far away from Willie Carwise!",1.4
11,"March 31, 2017",Was a long wait. Wanted a different vehicle but still happy with my purchase and Danny Martinez was very good at explaining everything to us that we'd ask. Definitely will go back in the future! And highly recommend.,4.8
12,"December 12, 2016","My wife and I got there at 12:30 we told the salesman we didn't have long,but to keep you from going through the xxxx we went through i'll go to 5:00 o'clock when we finally signed the paperwork,they said we could go down the street and have a brake controller installed at their expense,sales manager called and then told us that every thing was all setup.when we got to the store the parts the sales manager said were in the pickup weren't there.so we went back to the dealership but nobody had time to deal with our problem,I wouldn't go back if they gave me a new truck! The only reason I gave them 1 star was the price ",2.0
13,"November 06, 2016",Would not budge a penny on a used vehicle. I had a pre-approval. They contacted me via email twice in a week. Went down there . Tried to muscle me into a vehicle I want interested in . I guess they mistake kindness for weakness .  The car they were trying to dump on me had been on the lot almost 2 years. ,1.2
14,"November 03, 2016","Do no NOT go here for Pre Owned Used cars 
Bought a Ford from them I should of just gone to A Ford Dealership! I purchased Warrantty on it after my a.c. broke they told me ""oh your warranty doesn't include that "" had to buy all new tires $600 worth . Never gave me the Keyless entry code I kept on asking them for it they always told me ""oh yeah we will give it to you "" A year later and I just called them and they told me since it's the Ford I have to go to Ford to get the code but they won't pay for it even though I'm still buying my car from them they sold me overpriced car do not go here for a car. STORE MANAGER IS RUDE DO NOT BUY ANYTHING HERE GO SOMEWHERE ELSE ",1.6
15,"October 04, 2016","Went to this joke hole business because I got a flyer in the mail advertising ""select"" 2016 Dodge Ram 1500 Longhorns. Usually ignore the bait but this time i read every single word on the fine print and decided to go. Called up an exact Stock Number advertised and the salesperson brought it up. Flyer incentive brought the MSRP from 43k down to 29k. I got there on Sunday (last day of the sale) and sales guy worked it up but then manager got involved and decided to tell me at first that the truck in question was not part of the sale. Showed him the print on the flyer. Then changed his stance to the fine print telling me "" not all buyers will qualify"" i.e...incentives were geared more towards USAA, military and loyalty incentives, that kinda thing. Showed him my USAA member card, Military ID and credit score. He then tried to give me $2k for my trade in easily worth $6k lowest on KBB. Then told me the only way he could get me to the monthly pmt I wanted to get to ( which his numbers were $18 away from) was to sell my trade on my own and bring in my $6k cash from that sale and we'd work it out. By this point they were close to closing so he assured me that because I initiated the inquiry on the last day of the sale, he'd still honor the sale price next day.
So Next day I took my trade in to Carmax and guess what I got for it?...$6k. Called NS Ford to let them know I was on my way back with my cash to seal the deal on that Ram 1500 Longhorn...they said ""cool, see you soon.""
Got a ride there (without my trade-in) and the manager then said. ""Sorry...that sale ended yesterday"" 
It was clear the flyer I got in the mail was a gimmick to lure customers in, but they didn't anticipate anyone would read the EXACT Stock Number.  It became very clear they never intended to sell that truck. 
Went to Ancira and got the same truck at a match price. 
Here's my advice-Don't trust or step foot into Northside Ford! If ""0-stars"" were an option that would still be too high",1.2
16,"March 31, 2015",Great experience. Salesman Gary Parmalee made the deal easy! I was met by courteus @ helped thru the complete process! Cody @ Ryan also did a great job!!,5.0
17,"July 21, 2013",Great expierience we went into the dealership looking for a new car. First looked at the Challenger however we were not willing to spend that kinda money on a car. We did look at the 200 and decided that was what we needed to fit the budget. Great Sales team in that very helpful and our sales person Cruz understood our situation and so did the sales manager Scott they both worked hard with finance and we walked out with a new car and very happy would recommend  them. I will be back ,4.3
18,"June 30, 2013","We would not recommend this dealership at all!!! As a matter of fact we have been telling everyone we know not to shop at North Star Dodge! My husband and I went in to purchase a Journey for me. My parents were there too. ""Jose"" was the horrible salesman that was ""assisting us"". We were interested in the Journey AVP in the paper that was around 16,000 or 17,000. We explained that to Jose right off. He had a Journey ready for us to test drive because my parents arrived first and they told him what we wanted to look at. He was not informative about the vehicle at all! He was too busy ""texting"" in the back seat. He was not friendly. When he did speak he spoke fast like he had some place better to be. When we got back from the test drive he kept asking what color we wanted. He told us to walk to the back lot. He himself drove the vehicle we test drove back to the lot while we walked. While we were looking at colors he was walking way ahead of us...not talking to us other than saying this is the black one, red one, etc....Jose was again too busy texting to give us any quality time. After all, it was only a potential sale! When we finally sat down, we got lots of run around. We had to sign a paper before any info, numbers, etc. were discussed. He said he could not even help us unless we signed something. My husband was so angry and wanted to leave because he did not want to sign anything. I begged my husband to just sign it so we could see some numbers because I really liked the Journey. When my husband did sign it, Jose said, ""There, how hard was that?"" The nerve of that young man...so disrespectful and rude!!! We were finally informed that the ""Journey in the paper"" was a certain color and that it was gone. We got BS run around about numbers and info with a very rude Jose. We told him he was being rude and for the second time during our visit, he told us he has been Salesman of the month an kept pointing to his awards. I told him I didn't care about his awards...he was being rude to us. We stood up  to leave and my husband demanding a copy of what he signed because that is his right...it is his signature after all. We got the run around ""again"". They said Ok but never came back. My husband went into an office where several employees were grouped. The ""boss"" behind the counter said we don't give copies of that paper. My husband was not happy but said, ""Well at least tear it up"". The ""boss"" tore up something but my husband didn't even know if it was his signed paper or not. My husband said, ""Thank you all for a Wonderful Experience""...and we left.

I would like North Star Dealership to know that from there we went to San Antonio Dodge. Even though they were closed, the ""boss"" happened to be there and spoke with us. He asked us to come back the next day and we would be treated wonderfully. They very next day ""Memorial Day"", we not only purchased a Dodge Journey, we purchased the higher end Journey Crew. We spent over $10,000 more than the one we were looking at at North Star Dodge. We were so happy with our salesman and experience, we told my parents. Less that two weeks later, they purchased the higher end 2013 Dodge 300. Oh well Jose! ",1.0
19,"June 12, 2013","I bought a new Jeep and they were quick to get me in a loaner car while they got the one I wanted in stock. My Jeep is acting up and they tell me that they won't have a loaner for me. They are I've to reel you in and then you are a sucker at their mercy.  It took 2 months for them to give me my spare key. I kept having to call and remind them. When they finally got it, I was sent an informal text message.  Then I went to the dealership and they had no idea what I was taking about.  I had to wait until the dealer that sold me my car got done suckering another person into a sale to receive . The receptionist is rude, when I called to tell about my car problem she cut me off.  They are not willing to help at all. WOULD NEVER DO BUSINESS WITH EVER AGAIN!! Save yourself the trouble and go somewhere else. ",2.0
20,"June 06, 2011","I went and stood 5 minutes by a vehicle I was interested in. No one came over. I walked through the showroom with sales reps inside. No offer for assistance. I went to look at other vehicles. No offer for assistance. I went and finally asked the receptionist for a sales rep. One finally walks from behind where they were all laughing and cutting up. As we walked back to the vehicles, I mentioned the lack of assistance. He said it was the end of the month and every is getting your numbers in. I felt insulted. I asked to speak to the manager and that I wanted the manager outside with me where I had been sweating waiting for a sales person. It eventually came to raised voices and cursing. I was then told to speak to the new sales rep, who wasn't available.  I waited 5 minutes and the general manager happened to walk in. He was able to calm me down and convince me to give them another shot.  After 24 hours, I took his advice, I went through the online trade in page and sales application.   I received the canned email that someone would contact me shortly. I immediately replied back to the email stating that I wanted to do most of the dealing online because I was uncomfortable going back into the showroom where a sales person tried to intimadate me and his new sales manager try to cover it up.  I heard nothing back.  I called 3 hours later where the internet sales person said she would call me back in an hour. I waited 90 minutes.  She said she was extremely busy, but would contact me as soon as she could.  The following business day I received a call from her apologizing why she didn't call me back.  She seemed to miss the fact that I didn't mind her having to call me back, but just don't say she'll call back in 60 minutes.  

Between hostile sales people, shady sales manager, and non-responsive internet sales and service the general manager not only has to worry about competition, but his own people too.
