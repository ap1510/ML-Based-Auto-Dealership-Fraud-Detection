1,"March 15, 2019","Zach is unlike other car salesmen.  He actually listened to what I had to say and did not try to sell me something that I was not interested in just because he had it on the lot and wanted to make a sell.  He actually wanted to earn my business and the business of my friends due to his quality of upfront and honest dealings.  
I cannot speak for all the employees of this dealership either positive or negative but definitely recommend Zach as your salesman.

3,"November 17, 2018","All Star Ford has the WORST Service department! They NEVER keep you updated on your automobile.  I would call them several times for updates. The Service department stated they would call me back with an update!?! They would NEVER call me back. They have had the car for 5 weeks to fix the transmission.  I have spoke with the Service Manger and he passes the buck the General Manger and he never returns a call.  PLEASE save yourself time and MONEY and DO NOT USE THIS DEALERSHIP!  They are HORRIBLE! and I STILL DON'T HAVE THE CAR!

4,"March 29, 2018","Although I have paid off 2 vehicles in the past I have never actually car shopped. After about 6 months of shopping around I was ready to give up. Every dealership I went to talked fast and slick. Made promises that they knew they could not keep. I pretty much lost hope that I would find a vehicle that I liked and could afford. I decided to call All Star Ford in Kilgore and of course the same response ""Come on by I know we can help you!"" So I figured why not. What do I have to loose. Little did I know he actually meant it. After picking my son up from day care I stopped by the lot. Sony, the same man who I spoke with on the phone greeted me. I told him what I wanted. He showed me what he had and a few more choices. To make a long story short. He sold me a GREAT deal on a 2012 Ford Excape but its nothing in comparison to the customer service I received from All Star. The entire staff! They even helped me with my son as he ran around the lot. Sony was very personable and by the time I left I felt I had a friend. He cared about my wants but cared about my needs even more. Most of all I could tell he TRUELY cared. I would recommend everyone to All Star ford. They have the best deals and even better you will leave feeling great about your decision. ",5.0
5,"September 04, 2015","I wanted to trade in my 2013 F150 Super Cab with 31000 miles. They appraised it and offered me $17,500. I said that was to low we went back and forth for a while finally we settled on $20,000. I picked out the vehicle I wanted and finally we agreed on a price so the next day I cleaned out my truck. drove up to the dealership and told them I was ready to sign all of the paper work. The salesman says well we are only going to give you $18000 for your F150 I said yesterday you said 20000 he said well it's 18 now I was shocked. So I looked up the value of my truck on kbb and it was 20650. I showed him and he said they didn't use kbb.. they used nada. I was like ok your not going to honor your word from yesterday. He said it's 18000 that's all it's worth. So I decide to look at nada and to my surprise avg. trade 20275, rough18650, clean trade  21600  so I asked him what would  my trade be considered he said average to clean so I showed him my phone and said well that would make it worth around 21000 according to you. then he said they also looked at what they are going for at auction and some other web page. I asked him well are they putting in all of the options like the spay-in bed liner running boards and so on. He said I would think one has been doing it for 25 yrs. the other for 30yrs. he goes toget a copy of the report they are looking at and the finance manager comes out and said it's 18000. They would not or could not show me a report. I'm pretty sure they were lying and trying to rip me off. I like my ford truck but if I were you PLEASE GO TO LONGVIEW OR TYLER NOT TO THESE CROOKS.",1.0

7,"April 29, 2014","Had a great experience with this company when I purchased my 2010 Ford Flex with them in January 2010. Went straight back to them when I wanted to buy my 2014 Flex. They had worked out a deal that I had agreed to then got down to me making an appointment to go sign the papers and was told the price had gone up over $2,000!! And that was that. No good explanation. Conversation was over. Called Rockwall Ford and not only did they stand behind their word, they sold it to me for $500 less than All Star Ford had first agreed to with me to begin with AND had the car in place and ready for me to pick up last Friday morning!! Won't deal with them ever again. Business's should stand behind their word!!!",1.2

Very Nasty Service Manager and Owner

Update. I was Called from the Owner after i got a Call from Ford Corp Office about all this.  He Told me in short terms on the Phone ( Very Nasty) to get my beeping Car off his lot now! That thy will not work on it and i asked him to show me something and he reply was.  I am not . going to show you a beeping thing.  get you car off my lot now!    I called Ford Corp again to let them know just how bad and nasty the owner and service manger is. i will be going to the BBB over this and sending letters to the Ford ceo.   i only hope thy will replace the dealer or fix them where thy can not rip someone off like thy did to me.   Run away if you see them.",1.0
9,"October 20, 2011",The sales person (Nick Sweet) was a pleasure to work with. Took the dealership 2.5 hours to get the car detailed after the sale. The car had a noise develope in the transmission with in two weeks. Sounded like the imput bearing was shot. We took it back to get this certified used car with extra warranty repaired. Ford did not give them a new transmission just the parts to patch this one. Kilgore ford had this car for almost a month trying to get this tranmission quiet instead of getting a new one. This was a v6 car for my wife no hot rodding ever and yet the five speed was junk. We get the car back finally and the tranmission is quieter yet is not right. We tried to go out of town in this car and almost everytime on a long hill the engine would shit off before we got to the top of the hill. Twice now our vacation plans were ended due to this Ford Certified used car. AFter paying to get it towed home the last time and then towed to the dealership for the last time just a warning a Ford Certified used car can ruin your credit and damm near get you run over when it dies on the expressway. Ford doesn't care they just keep hounding me for not wanting to pay for a car who has almost asmany miles on a wrecker than we drove it. ,2.2
