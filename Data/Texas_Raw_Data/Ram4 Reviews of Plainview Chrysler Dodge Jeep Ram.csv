0,"March 17, 2020","I'd like to thank Service Mngr Chris, Chad, J.T., and the technician who helped me. They were professional, friendly, and very helpful with my 2019 Ram Laramie. J.T. knows the 12 inch screen UConnect system better than anyone I've found. He and Chris taught me how to use the Navigation system and performed an update that revived my back-up camera and SiriusXM.",5.0
