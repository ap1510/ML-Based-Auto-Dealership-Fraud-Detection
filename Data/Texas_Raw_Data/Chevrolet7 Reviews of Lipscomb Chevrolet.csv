1,"July 24, 2019",Great experience with both Sales and Service. Fast and Easy process with great people. I have bought and serviced multiple vehicles within the Lipscomb family of dealerships.,5.0
2,"January 21, 2019","I have bought several vehicles from them and they are always competitive with other dealers and they usually will beat their price.  I highly recommend this dealership.  If you are looking to buy a vehicle then give them at least a shot, you will not be disappointed. If you are looking for a great salesman then ask for Chance.",5.0

4,"August 29, 2017","After the service was performed the service engine light was still staying on for 10 seconds after starting the vehicle. I told the service advisor about it and he tried to reset it multiple times without any luck. Rather than taking the time to check it and see what the issue was, I was told to bring it back another time and they will check it out or I could use my hand scan tool to see if it will read the code! This was all said to me knowing that I am about to have to drive the vehicle over 2000 miles in a few days! That's some really good customer service you got going there! Guess you won't have to worry about me coming back!",3.6
5,"May 13, 2017","I came to Lipscomb following my visit at another dealership where I was laughed at for my list of wants and written off as someone who didn't really want to buy. They held me captive for hours running numbers and did check back in often at all. I was shopping with my ten month old baby so it was awful. When I came over to Lipscomb I didn't know any of the salesmen, but I met Kenneth and showed him my list and told him the price I wanted to be at. He showed me the car I ended up buying. While we were doing paperwork and running numbers he gave my daughter a coloring sheet, and a balloon. When I went to do my test drive he carried the car seat and helped me install it. I did not buy the first day I came and looked because they just didn't have the right color, but based on my experience I asked if they could dealer trade for the right color so that I could buy from Kenneth. I sincerely appreciate the Lipscomb crew they were all very nice and helpful during my car buying experience.",5.0
6,"September 12, 2011","I hae had my car for 6 months. I bought it used and it was missing some lugnuts and a fuse box cover. The dealer promised to deliver the items and put it in the contract that these items would be taken care of. The lugnuts were replaced almost immediately. The fuse box cover I still have not recieved. The fuse box sets under the hood and will depriciate the value of my car. I have called  every month for 6 mths to see if this part is in yet. I keep getting the same answer "" We keep getting the wrong one in."" SERIOUSLY!!!! By now they could have driven to Chrysler manufactor and picked up the right one themselves. Instead no one calls me to tell the progression of this issue. I have called them. I have gone up there 3-4 times for them to ""look at it."" One guy even took a picture of it. This is ridiculous!! This is the second vehicle I have bought from them. The 1st the service was slow but tolerable. I was not impressed by no means. The time I am less than impressed and wil no longer by from them. I will go back to Jerry's Cheverolet In Weatherford from now on. I have always had good service there. The ONLY reason they didn't my buisness these two times is because we moved here. I will take the drive for better service!!!",1.8
