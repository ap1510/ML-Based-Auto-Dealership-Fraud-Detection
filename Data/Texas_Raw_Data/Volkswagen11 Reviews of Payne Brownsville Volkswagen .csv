7,"November 01, 2018","After test driving the Passat with Ivan, a very attentive sales rep, I knew I was sold. The car sold itself, but with the determination of Ivan and his sales manager Roger Davila, they were able to offer me a competitive price for the Passat and a very acceptable trade-in value for my old car that kept me from shopping in San Antonio. Thatâ€™s a win for me, Ivan & Roger, and the RGV. 
Thank you guys, I love my car!!",5.0
