0,"July 07, 2017","I purchased 3 vehicles from Gloff. My first 2 were great.... My 3rd purchase was horrible. My car was totaled by the hail storm..  Gloff did not have the vehicle I wanted so was told to find one and they would handle the rest. Two months later I found out the car they delivered to me had frame damage and had been stolen which was all listed on the VPN nbr.  I take some fault since I did not run a car fax however I trusted Gloff to handle everything since they were my Car guys. They charged me 1695.00 to fix the frame which was not fixed correctly. I have been thru 2 sets of tires then was told they would charge me 54.00 to put on my license plates   When I asked the owner to make it right here is his solution. I put down 3500.00 , transfer 7,000 from my loan into another loan and make payments of 350.00 for 6 years. I have all proof and paper work to back up my claims. I learned a hard lesson trusting Gloff Ford. Please do not go with what they tell you. Always do their job for them. I am now stuck with a car I gave 16,00"" for that is worth roughly 5500.00.  ",1.0
1,"August 27, 2015","My husband and I just bought a used 2013 Ford Taurus from Gloff Ford, they made the whole transaction so easy, from the friendly salesman to the guy in finance, who made the paperwork
so easy compared to the dealers we have dealt with before. We loved the small town atmosphere.
We weren't subjected to the hustle and bustle you feel in a big store, when they are trying to rush you thru the sell. We will recommend to our family and friends.!",5.0
2,"January 24, 2014","Service Dept. seems incompetent. They might be able to change your oil or rotate tires. If something complicated, forget it. Kept old Ford car for 4 days, couldn't figure out problem, but just tried different stuff, hit or miss, charging big $$$ along the way for every little thing they did. And they accomplished nothing. Finally, on 5th day, we got car back, still broken. Will take somewhere else. Never here again. Fool me once, etc.",1.8
