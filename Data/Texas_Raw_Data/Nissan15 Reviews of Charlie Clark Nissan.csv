14,"September 08, 2017","Do NOT trust these slimebags AT ALL! Crystal hounded my husband on the phone FOR DAYS about coming to the dealership for a ""guaranteed prize"" that he had, supposedly, won. My husband finally goes in, and is stalked by some creep named Fong from the second he gets out of his car. My husband finds Crystal,  who tells him that Fong will, indeed, be the one helping him. (Ugh.) So, Fong gets my husband in his golf cart, drives him out to the far end of the dealership (it's huge), tells him that he hasn't won anything, but tries to sell him a car! LOL. After asking politely three times to be taken back to the front, my husband had to JUMP OUT of the cart, and walk back. Btw, my husband is disabled!! So, Crystal & Fong, we actually ARE in the market for a car for our son, but we will definitely NOT purchase from Charlie Clark Nissan because of your dishonesty, and horrible lack of professionalism. Oh yeah, my dad is looking for a new car, too. Guess where he won't be shopping! We will, however, tell everyone we know what happened today.....jerks.",1.0
