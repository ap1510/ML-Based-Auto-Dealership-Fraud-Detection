1,"March 27, 2020","With some reluctance, I felt the time had come to replace my great 8-year old F150.  The San Antonio dealership where I had purchased and maintained my truck had lost my respect, loyalty and support for their deteriorating and disappointing customer service support.  Eventually, I focused on dealing with Ford of Boerne, in the hopes that I could ""survive"" the normal xxxx of purchasing a new vehicle;  From the time I walked into the dealership (Prior to the visit I had spoken to the online sales manger, Mike and my designated salesman, Adrian, narrowing my desires to a Ranger) I was warmly greeted by all staff members.  Unexpectedly, the negotiations were cordial and transparent, as I also worked with sales manger Jim.  The respect and customer support was superlative, especially when I requested a last minute change in the purchase.  The finance representative, J. Michael and his manger, Mr. Galvan were unexpectedly (to me) open and supportive of my last minute change.  Bottom line, my overall experience was IMPRESSIVE and I felt I was treated in a friendly, honest,and  transparent manner; relieving much of my aforementioned anxiety.  At this time, Ford of Boerne has earned my trust and business in the years to come. ",5.0
2,"December 01, 2019","Looking for a 2019 F150 with specific color, trim and options. Contacted multiple dealers looking for best price. Ford of Boerne had a truck that matched my specs. Michael Smith quoted me an out the door price of $48,829. Another dealer quoted me a price of $46,362 for the same truck. Vin numbers matched. ",1.0
3,"August 17, 2019","I have purchased four truck from Jennings Anderson and have always had them serviced there.  This past week I brought my 2011 F350 in for a 45,000 mile service and a problem with check engine light.  I felt that the service advisor sold me as many service procedures as he could, many of which were not warranted on a truck with 45,000 miles.  One of the procedures was a repeat of one done less than 10,000 miles previously.  Because of this I do not know if I could trust the service advisors in the future and just may have to take my business elsewhere   ",3.2
4,"June 01, 2019","A bad experience from beginning to end.  We ended up walking out on the deal because they did not live up to their end of it.  We regret ever having wasted time with them.  They were unethical, dishonest, and incompetent.  We saw a car we liked on their website and had them send us the sticker so we could see what it had on it and the price.  When we got to the dealership, we found they put a SECOND sticker on the car with another $1300 of dealer-added options, like paint and interior protection (which is invisible), tinted windows, nitrogen in the tires, and some insurance-like coverages, none of which we wanted.  These are all the things consumer groups have been telling people to avoid for decades, but this dealership is still doing all the same old unethical dealer tricks.  We drove around the lot in a golf cart for 15 minutes because the salesman couldn't find the car we came to see, and when we found it, it had a dead battery.  After dealing with 6 different salesmen and managers, we came to a deal on the car, which included a new battery to replace the dead one.  But before getting to a deal, we had to go through more of the same old dishonesty.  They told us they were selling us the car ""below cost"" and ""weren't making any money on it.""  Well, I must be the best negotiator in the history of the world because just about every car dealer for the last forty years has told me that.  When I asked what the $150 Document Fee was for, they ""didn't know"".  Just consider that at a wage of $20 per hour, that would pay for 7 1/2 hours of document preparation.  Ridiculous.  When we showed up at the agreed-upon time and day to get the car, they again couldn't find it and had done nothing to prepare it, including not having the new battery we agreed upon.  We walked out and are glad we did.  I would have regretted giving them my money.",1.7
5,"February 25, 2019","TREMENDOUS!!!  I have purchased 20+ new cars over my years, and I have never had an experience like I did when I recently purchased my 2019 Ford F150 from Ford of Boerne.  I would like to mention three employees, specifically:  Sonny Tydlacka, David Cruze, and Jim Dames.  From the moment I arrived at the dealership, I felt like family.  The BEST salesman I have ever worked with came in the person of Sonny Tydlacka.  I immediately felt like I had known Sonny for years, and the care he took to find me the right truck was above-and-beyond.  Sonny wasn't just interested in getting me into any new truck, he was interested in finding me the exact truck that fit my desires.  He was able to find a brand new arrival as if I had custom ordered it.  He and David Cruze spent a great deal of time with me and my wife... way more than I had previously been accustomed during other new car purchases (many different brands over the years).  They both were eager to ensure we knew of every feature and benefit of our new truck.  It was clear they both were proud of their brand and the quality of their product!  Enter Jim Dames.  As the sales manager, Jim personally involved himself in our purchase and made us feel so welcome and appreciated.  At no time did I feel we were being offered empty platitudes or being patronized.  Their genuine care, attention, and sincerity were monumentally evident.  As a team in new car sales, these gentlemen cannot be beat, and we truly felt like family... and still do a month after purchase.  I would happily buy another vehicle from Ford of Boerne and recommend them highly!  If you visit Ford of Boerne, ask for Sonny, Dave, or Jim and I can assure you that you will be treated as good as any customer can possibly be!",5.0

10,"November 13, 2018","Jennings Ford, is great. My name is Hal Bartlett and you  can ask the manager or shane my salesperson for my phone number to call me because this is a real honest rating. I have a new 2018 Ford 4x4 xlt sitting in my driveway. I traded in my 2007 that I bought that year from Jennings Ford. So they know me, and wow, let me tell you I got a price for a 2018 unreal deal. 53K truck for 39K and my trade in. Best Price in town. It's loaded, so much new tech that it will take me forever to learn. You see, I'm 72, sell insurance now and have some rental property I love to take care of. Because I was a contractor in St. Louis most of my life. So that means I have never from the age of 21 not had a truck. Well there you go. You want some real country treatment head for Jennings Ford.

11,"November 08, 2018","My wife just bought a new Escape from the dealer. All the staff were extremely knowledgable and helpful. The price was also good. They are helping to get another car for me, so I am very happy.  Would definitely recommend this dealership.",5.0
12,"November 01, 2018","I took my new F-150 to JA for service for more than 13 years, (I had not bought it there.) I got many years of great service from that vehicle, but it finally quit at 330,000+ miles. Earlier this year I bought a used F-150 there, which my wife has taken over, so recently I bought another used F-150 there. Both times the salesman was Jason Lay (and his boss John Bray). John Bray's brother Will Bray was my service manager for all those first 13 years, and was always honest and a straight shooter with us, and still is, and he remains our service manager today. I am 74 years young and have purchased many vehicles in my life and can tell you Jason Lay knows his product. I would be surprised if you asked him a question he could not answer about a Ford product, especially an F-150, but if he couldn't off the top of his head, he would have the answer for you in a few minutes. So, I expect your thinking well, this guy obviously lives in the neighborhood, and goes to this dealership because its handy. Well the answer is nope, our home is about 1.5 hours away from JA in Boerne. We go to JA because of the quality of the people there, and the quality of the product. I wouldn't buy anywhere else.",5.0
13,"October 26, 2018","I am very satisfied with Sam Castillo and his manager. They are customer oriented and made my car buying experience amazing.  Brandon Brady is also extremely helpful and very knowledgable. You have a solid team working at your dealership.

16,"October 09, 2018",Service exceeded my expectations. On this visit there was a limited window of opportunity to get the service done on my truck and the service team was to only get one item done but they instead were able to get everything that needed to be done within that window including the 2 recalls.,5.0
17,"October 04, 2018","Both my son and I owned Toyota Tacomas and were trying to decide to Tacoma or F-150. Looked at Toyota first and both Toyota of Boerne and Red McCombs Toyota pulled the old BS sales tactic of start high, let me get my mgr to what will take only to barely budge on price. Went in to JA Ford and met with Jim and Mike from Internet Sales Dept. Wow what a difference! No hassle, no pressure. My son bought a truck on Sept 28th and I came back and bought one on Oct 1st. We not only bought trucks that offered a lot more features, matched the mpg of Tacoma's for around the same price! Do yourself a favor and forget all the time searching in front of a computer. Go see Jim and Mike. They will find what you are looking for without all the BS sales tactics. ",5.0

20,"August 28, 2018","I purchased a 2014 Ford Focus from Jennings in October 2015.  The car is a LEMON and they knew about the class action suit on this make/model and sold it to me anyway.  The automatic clutch went out in March, 2016 and again in July, 2017.  I just had it in the shop Aug, 2018 with power problems (again).  Because the clutch is only covered under a 60k warranty, they did not replace.  They just ""advised"" how I should drive the car.   The clutch will now cost me $700 for the part and 10 hours labor..to the tune of over $2k.  My Goal:  Sell the LEMON before the 100,000 mile warranty expires.  Better yet - trade it in at Jennings and see what piece of C**P they try to sell me next.

Disgruntled. ",2.8
21,"August 23, 2018","Had some issues with the plates for a CPO F150  which I received late. I also had to get the timing chain replaced, which granted is a design issue that is  known by Ford.

28,"June 01, 2018","Thank you for your wonderful service!
Every time I come in for service....Jacob is very helpful.  He is patient and listens to me as I explain minor concerns with the car... best story of all....

I work as a personal shopper so unfortunately I drive very much!!! I have had the car since October and have accrued 30,000 plus miles....when I brought the vehicle in as per the oil change sticker and the mileage registered on my vehicle....Jacob was concerned that I really didn’t need an oil change...however when I mentioned that the mileage was correct and I REALLY DO drive a bunch.... he suggested that sometimes I can wait a little bit past the recommended mileage change...
Bottom line...Jacob only things service is required when needed....and that is FANTASTIC!!!!

Keep up the great work Jacob and thank you for being my service advisor...you deserve a raise and/or a promotion.",5.0
29,"March 21, 2018",We have used Jennings Anderson for service on our vehicles for the last 7+ years and have been extremely pleased with the service we have received. We made our first purchase here when we bought a 2018 Explorer. David Cruze was the sales person who worked with us on the deal. He was very professional and very pleasant to work with. We both agreed that it was a very good experience and we liked the way Jennings Anderson dealt with sales customers. We highly recommend them for anyone who is in the market for a new car purchase.,5.0

Thank you👍So far,I've been happy except Jennings Anderson Ford when they determined what the problem was with my Ford Focus 2016,they did not readjust the clock to the correct time and the calendar to the correct date on the digital display.

40,"September 16, 2016","We bought a used Ford Edge on July 3, 2014 and wanted to return it two days latter.  We finally sold the thing on Aug 9, 2016. The dealer and Ford says we owned the thing for 52 months.  July 3, 2014 to Aug 9, 2016 is only 24 months. Why should we have to pay for a service contract on a vehicle when we did not own it. They will not pay us $727.25 the amount we did not use.",1.5
41,"August 10, 2016","Horrible experience.. Went in to buy my first Ford truck. I like black trucks but they didn't have one on the lot in my price range. They said they would get one from another dealer with no problems. I test drive a white one with navigation and a 3.5 ecoboost and they said the one they would be getting for me is ""the same truck except it's black"". I took their word for it and they put me through the finance department. Several days later, I take delivery of the truck and soon realize they sold me a dumbed down version of the truck they promised. No navigation and most importantly no ecoboost. They sold me a regular V6. When I confronted them about it they basically said there was nothing they could do except take the truck back as a trade and loose several thousand dollars. They screwed me over and I'm stuck with this truck that I hate. These people are crooked and liars and I'll never do business with them again.",1.0
42,"May 25, 2016","I purchased a used vehicle in 2009 from JAF and have had regular maintenance performed as well as unscheduled emergency repairs. Their prices are competitive and always what I anticipate.  On the very few occasions that I had an issue with service, it was addressed promptly by Jeff Asher.  Recently I have been looking for my next used vehicle and salesman Jason Lay has really gone above and beyond to satisfy my needs as a customer.  He has even answered questions regarding trucks on other dealer's lots. The other dealer was trying to convince me that the Ford warranty did not stay with the vehicle and of course wanted to sell me a more expensive truck.  The lack of pressure really makes the shopping process easy and relaxing, especially in their shaded lot.  The experience here is not the typical big city dealership type and once you visit JAF it will be difficult to visit any other dealership.      ",5.0
43,"October 10, 2015","Trey and I have had a relationship for several months now through emails. My wife and I have just moved to Texas. Being former Government employees, our jobs still had demands that we had to resolve. Trey was understanding of our situation and afforded us extra time for travel until we could meet in person.
Within 24 hours of returning to Texas, we made an appointment to see Trey. From the moment we met Trey was treating us like family members he had not seen for a while.  We talked for about an hour without even talking about a new vehicle.  Trey knew through our emails what we were looking for.  Trey had already lined up several vehicles for us to test drive. It was not long before my wife had made her decision based on Trey's endless knowledge of the vehicle.  His guidance was based on our wants and needs. You could tell our selection was based on Trey's advice not just by the largest sales amount.
 I do not know how long Trey has been with your dealership, but he is truly a very valuable asset to you.
Dealing with a salesman is usually one of the most hated experiences for most people.  Dealing with Trey was a tremendously enjoyed meeting. Even since the sale of my wife's truck, Trey still calls us making sure we are fully satisfied with our purchase and answered any questions about the new truck.
 I am currently looking for a new Mustang and I do not have to tell you where we will be making our purchase. Trey and your dealership have earned our unwavering allegiance. Rest assured our family and friends are going to get tired of us bragging about Trey and your Dealership. In closing, I must say Trey is the best salesman I have ever dealt with. Trey is not only a valued employee to you, He is one of the Finest men I have met.
Please feel free to show this review to anyone and use it how you best see fit.  I will also speak with anyone about Trey and your Dealership. Thanks again Trey!!!!!!

50,"June 02, 2015","I went car shopping on Saturday.  Before I visited JAF, I went to 4 other car dealerships.  I encountered high pressure saleman. They all made me feel like they were more concerned about making a sale than what my needs and wants are.  Even though I prefer FORD, I was open to purchasing something different.  However, my experiences with the dealerships prevented me from pulling the trigger on a purchase.  I was going to call it quits and decided to drive to Boerne.  I'm glad I did.  I was met by a product specialist named Brett.  He quickly identified my needs and wants.  He took the time to show me several vehicles.  Even though it was storming he did not let that stop him from showing me a few vehicles in the rain.  I picked out a vehicle that I was interested in.  It was a breath of fresh air to know that I didn't have to worry about haggling the price, due to the fact that JAF has the lowest price already marked on the vehicle. I met with Brandon the financial manager.  He took time to explained the different warranties available to me.  After choosing one that met my needs, we finished the paperwork quickly.  Brandon explained everything to me and was patient while I asked questions.  After the deal was finished everyone made me feel like part of the JAF famliy.  Brett walked me around the facilty (which is very spacious and comfortable) and showed me the Service Department and other sections that I might utilize.  I felt good with making this purhcase and I will come back when my wife is ready to purhcase a new vehicle.  Good Job Guys !!!

I was so focused on the amount of money I was spending on the truck and not going over a monthly amount that I did not pay that much attention.

I am used to the person going over the vehicle price, the trade in price , additional charges, interest being paid for the duration of the loan. In a way you might consider this misleading.
