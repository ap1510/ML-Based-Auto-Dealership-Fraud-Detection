2,"July 23, 2018",Purchased a new 2018 Toyota 4Runner from Reagor Dykes Toyota in Plainview.  Anson Salazar was our sales professional.  This purchase rates as the #1 easiest purchase in my 52 years.  Customer service is second to none.  If you want to avoid the hassles and high pressure techniques of most dealerships‚Äî go to Reagor Dykes and ask for Anson!  Could not be happier with this experience from top to bottom!!,5.0

5,"February 14, 2018",I recently purchased a car from Reagor-Dykes Toyota in Plainview and had a great experience. Lincoln and the team at Reagor-Dykes made my experience as painless and stress free as possible. We did not feel pressured into making a hasty decision Like you often times do when buying a vehicle. Lincoln was patient and very helpful. I would highly recommend him and this dealership to anyone looking to get into a new ride and will definitely use them in the future! ,5.0
6,"February 07, 2018","This dealership was top notch! Lincoln went above and beyond to make sure I purchased the truck I was most comfortable with. He gave me suggestions and his advice, but was in no way pushy what-so-ever. After I decided on a truck the process was absolutely painless. So quick and professional. I felt like family by the end of the whole process! I would recommend  Rager Dikes and (Lincoln Zapata in particular) to anyone who is looking for a new or used vehicle.  Thank you very much and I will be seeing you in the future!

11,"January 09, 2018",Everyone was excellent to work with.  They went above and beyond to accommodate our needs and requests.  I changed my mind on the vehicle I wanted and they never made us feel like we put them out even though it caused them a lot of extra time and effort to locate what I wanted.  We couldn't have asked for a friendlier atmosphere.  Nathan did a great job making us feel comfortable with our choice in the vehicle we selected and in the dealership as a whole.  Jordan searched and found just what we wanted.,5.0

We were giving up and ready to throw down a towel, after literally  playing musical chairs with several different car dealerships here in Lubbock...until we stumbled accidentally on line across this Gal üòâ She is AMAZING!

20,"August 18, 2017","I have been needing a newer SUV/family car for our lifestyle for over a year now. I found a vehicle I liked from this location and called, Alec was the salesman who helped me. I live about an hour and a half away and did the entire deal by phone. Between my banker and Reagor Dykes Plainview's team, I did little to no work in order to get me what I wanted. I have NEVER had a dealership work with me the way they did. From the general manager to the answering service at this location, every single department was very nice and listened to what I wanted. They worked after hours to get me the deal. After the deal was established within 24 hours, they had a driver bring me the vehicle, test drive it, ask any questions before signing and even had a courtesy call from my salesman. How convenient this all was! I would recommend calling this location and dealing with them for your next purchase.",5.0
21,"August 09, 2017","We had a wonderful truck shopping experience with Reagor-Dykes Toyota. Our salesman, Alan Medina was VERY knowledgeable,courteous and informative concerning the truck we were considering. We were in no way pressured and welcomed to look at other vehicles if we chose. All dealerships should be more like this one. If they were, maybe people wouldn't have to sneak onto their lots on Sundays to look at vehicles. ",5.0
