38,"April 25, 2020","If I really want to share my thought on this dealership, it would be 4 pages long. To some it up, I was told a vehicle was at a certain price. I agreed to the price with the sales person. Price was confirmed. Then they ran may credit. Credit over 700. When it was time to sign papers, the agreed price was increase because they added an extended warranty to my total without advising me in the beginning and saying it was not optional. If they do not reverse the inquiry, I will take this up with my general council. This is just one part of the issue with this dealership. Rude sale reps. Bait and switch tactics, need I say more!!!! STAY AWAY!!

40,"April 20, 2020","Do not use this dealer. Please read before you go any further. This dealer just gave me a big running around and wasted my time. I talked with 2 different sale men about this jeep and have 2 emails with Enrique Gonzalez about it. Tried to call him 3 times to set up a test drive but he never picked up. So I call the main number and talked with the receptionist and she set a test drive for me and I gave her the stock number and told her I would be there at 715pm today. She said no problem we will have it ready for you. I showed and talked with Rick and he said he would get our info and get the jeep for us to test drive. We also had a trade in so we gave him the keys to get a price. He left the room we sat there for 20mins with no one coming in. I was getting ready to find out was going on.Then Rick showed up with one if their managers who said that he wanted to go over the options we had. Then he tells us after waiting over 20min and more that the jeep was not there but it not an issue. I said no it is issue I just drove 45 mins to test drive jeep 
and talked with 3 employees here and gave the stock number and no one told me it was not there. If they would have I would not have wasted my time. The manager said he did not waste our time and I got a little loud and said wasting my time is not an issue. At that point I was done with the whole thing. In this time with all going on with covid 19 and having to set up a test drive then driving all the way there for the jeep to not even be there is bull. If I could give 0 i would. I will talk this dealer down to everyone I know or meet. Poor customer service. If their Gm wants to call me they have my number. Do not waste your time with this dealership

55,"March 31, 2020","We did our research online when looking for a fair priced deal and came cross an ad for this dealership. Wife and I did the pre approval for our auto loan and all was well. We took the day off from work with the plan of picking up our new car, a 2019 Sentra that was shown in the ad as one of the last remaining new 2019 in stock. So far so good, but when we arrived at the dealership and spotted the car, looking at it from the outside the appearance was horrible, as if they really weren't trying to sell it at all.  That was nothing compared to the appearance of the car on the inside, which looked like a couple of teenagers had a prom date in the back seat. I'm not one to bash a dealership, with everything thats going on right now, but at least make sure the vehicle is clean and ready for pickup. Before I forget, nothing in the ad mentioned that the car had 7600 miles on it. Please take this into consideration so the next customer doesn't have to deal with this type of unprofessionalism Care for all of your customers, all of them with respect. I feel like we should have just sheltered in place and tossed back a couple of Rita's. By the way the stock no of the vehicle is 92504.",1.4

62,"March 24, 2020","The dealer listed the price of a vehicle (before TTL) at multiple online sites (cars.com, CarGurus.com, their site, etc) as $14,691. Once I went and test drove, the salesman told me that the price of the vehicle was actually starting around $18,000 due to things that they did on the front end as dealer add-ons (window tint, EPP, GPS, tire locks, etc) and there was no wiggle room. He told me that they did this pricing advertisement technique specifically to attract people to the dealership. If I would've known that the actual price of the car was $18K, I would've never test drove it or even gone in the first place. It was a massive disappointment and a waste of my time, as I was ready to buy my first car and actually in love with the car. It was sleezy and made me understand why people hate used car dealers. If you're looking to be deceived and ripped off, this is the perfect place to come! Don't worry, I've already filed a complaint to the DMV about this massive misrepresentation.",2.2

Derrian Brown, is hands down, the brightest star at Central Nissan.  His demeanor, car knowledge and general disposition, made a stressful experience more bearable.

I recently had a car accident and had been informed that my car was to be totaled out, that day. Along with burying my child’s father that morning, it was not the most optimal time to be making a large purchase. 

From the moment I stepped out of my rental car, until the minute I took the SOLD photo with him, Derrian was the most professional salesperson I’ve encountered.

71,"February 25, 2020","Melissa, I drove nearly two hours to see this car. I brought cash with me and was prepared to drive away with it. It was totally a bait and switch. They did not have this car on the lot, or at least did not let me see it. 

There are a couple things about the lot that I think you should know:
1. The lot was very dark, not at all like a car lot to show off the cars. The walkways were not illuminated well.

2. The doors to the building were not clearly marked. I was not sure which door to enter. The text on the door was reversed so that it could be read from the inside. I just entered the door that was not being guarded by guys sitting on the ground.

3. We were greeted by a sales person who said we could not speak with you. She said that you were not a sales person and did not have the ability to work with me.

4. There were guys just sitting on the sidewalk near the side door. I do not know who they were, I assumed they were mechanics or make-ready personnel, but they could have been anybody. Combined with the poor lighting, I felt unsafe at the used car center.

5. Why was it important for me to show a picture ID before the sales person could talk with me. I had not asked to drive the car yet.

6. Outdated sales techniques were used. The bait and switch is so old and inappropriate. The sales person said she would go get the car an pull it up to the from so we could see it, and then another guy came in to tell us of other similar cars on the lot. Then the supervisor came in and told us the car was not on the lot. 


I understand that you cannot hold a car for me without any earnest money. You told me over the phone that the car had just arrived. I told you that I was coming in at 7:30 to see the car, and you said that you would be there. You were not there and neither was the car. It would have been courteous to give me a call to let me know the car had already been sold. It would have saved me the two hour trip to your store. 

Overall, the used car center at South Houston Nissan was not pleasant. Lawyers, dentists, and used car salesmen have a notorious reputation for unpleasant experiences, my experience last night reinforced this fact. I have purchased my last five used cars from individuals. My experience last night at South Houston Nissan reminded me why I stopped going to used car lots.

Sincerely,

Bobby",1.0
72,"February 20, 2020",Mr. Adams was very rude and sarcastic with me. They made numerous promises until I signed the papers and gave my down payment. Now they just ignore me. Beware before you buy here. They lied about the year of the vehicle I purchased. The promised to install a sunroof for me if I purchase this vehicle. They only gave me one key and promised a second one. No owners manual on a brand new car. Large batch of wires fell out from under the dash on a brand new vehicle. They promised to fix. Now they just ignore me and have not even attempted to fix anything they promised several weeks after purchase  ,1.0

- The sales lady made an appointment for me to come and see the vehicle - after driving a long way, leaving kids at home with others, found out they don’t have the specific sales person and nothing they could do. The person who made the appointment , she should be trained properly and not waste customers time.
- When we got there, two great salesman tried their best to convince us. Kudos to them. We went around to look at a vehicle from outside and didn’t find any...
- When we came back after driving around the entire vehicle lot, we requested for the manager.. a girl walked up and said that she is the manager - when I asked for her business card, she was happy to show me her card - when I questioned what’s on her card is not what she said her title was, she ran away.. 
- Aaron came by to apologize again.. though he was trying to explain and offer me two gallons of gas, that’s not what I wanted - I want them not to do this to other customers... Train them properly..
Thanks to Aaron and hope they fix 
- better customer service
- integrity
- proper training for folks who makes appointments and familiar of Nissan vehicles..

Best sales advisor there is as far as I'm concerned.  I purchased my Jeep Renegade April 2019.  Fast forward to February 2020 my trucks in the shop and the radio is burnt out do to a part malfunction.  When I bought the truck the radio had to be replaced, broken by the previous owner, but the dealership replaced it at no cost to me and has a one year warranty.  So now I need the original invoice so that I don't have to come off of $850.00 and I've been getting the run around for days from the Jeep dealership where the radio was originally purchased.

But I was lucky as I was introduced to Nick Mullas. Man what a wonderful dealer he is , he was very detailed,  explained me all the aspect of the car. He cleared all my doubts, allowed me to take a look under the hood again detailing the Nissan 167 pt Certification process. When we took the car for test drive, I almost made my mind on the car as it was very well maintained. Nick Mullas again explained about the overall buying process, clarified all my doubts. Even after the sale Nick Mullas followed up with me ensuring that all of  questions on the car were answered , he also got me a follow up appointment for a quick service after a week of my car purchase to get some small issue which I noticed to be fixed.

In a nutshell: my wife took her Altima in to diagnose a warning light for the airbag.  They charged us $185 for the diagnosis and gave us an estimate of almost $5000.  We took it for a second opinion to another dealership and (drum roll): the problem was a disconnected plug.  Literally a plug needed to be reconnected.  Problem solved.  

We called service to ask for a partial refund of the $185, since it was completely wrong.  They refused, and said they'd give us an oil change and a pair of wiper blades.  Needless to say, we're not taking our car to them for service, even an oil change.",1.8

102,"November 13, 2019","WORST experience EVER! (See Photos).I have not ever been so rudely disrespected. I'm still in shock!

Online I came across 2 Nissan Sentra S. A NEW 2019 for $15.5k & a USED 2019 grey/silver for $14k. My reservation was for Saturday 11/9/19 at 6pm. I went in around 1:30p. When I arrived; I was greeted by Rashad & his trainee.

I gave Rashad both ads from THEIR website. As we're going over features; the S model didn't have keyless entry, but SV model did. I was sold immediately (I had 0 desire for the drawn out 'test drive'). This is not my first time buying/trading a vehicle. I have my own APPROVED financing; all I needed was car info & final price. 

He comes back w/ the price marked up to $20.5k (CONVENIENTLY w/o $2.6k dealer discount), & only Nissan $2k rebate =18.5k but ADDS Wheel locks & Nitro-$599, EPP-$1,899, & Tint-$499=2,997. $22k BEFORE TTL! I'm NOT paying $3k for wheel locks on a Nissan, AIR in tires, a GLORIFIED wax/wash & a OVERPRICED window tint.

I kindly advised him that I didn't need nor want any of those things & showed him FOUR 2019 Nissan SV CURRENTLY listed on THEIR website for $15,681. Here is where things go downhill fast. Rashad leaves & a sales manager returns to reiterate the add ons come w/ it. If it 'comes' w/ it; it would be INCLUDED in the LISTING price. I leave telling him that if the car is not $15,681 w/ said 'add ons'; no deal.

I return a few hours later, they persisted w/ the add-ons & I left again. FACTORY made cars DON'T ""come"" w/ DEALER add-ons! They're ""dealer add-ons"" because the MANUFACTURER DOESN'T offer them as purchase options;otherwise you'd have to upgrade or wait for a CUSTOM made car..FROM the MANUFACTURER!!

Monday, I was still interested in the model & decided to reach out to the GM via reply email/# provided in a 'welcome' email. NO RESPONSE the ENTIRE day. Today, OC contacts me & during the conversation, I QUOTE VERBATIM, ""We do not have to list them."" YES YOU DO! If they are NOT listed as MANUFACTURE INCLUDED FEATURES they are OPTIONAL! It is in FACT ILLEGAL to NOT list them & force the charges to the customer! I then spoke to customer specialist Ashley. 3rd time is a charm, right?

I was UTTERLY & COMPLETELY WRONG. I get there & met Leo. He pulls my file & says the GM would come speak w/me. I was NOT met w/the GM (Chad Milow); instead it was a sales director, Roger. He shows me where they have marked the add-ons down to $400 (coincidence?). I tell him they have 16 Sentra SV on their lot. ONE of them is pure factory. He tells me no; which I know is a LIE. 16 customers added the EXACT same add-ons that were outsourced & DIDN'T purchase? Add-ons CANNOT be put on a FACTORY car until the car is SOLD! 

I call Nissan corporate to verify. He gets PISSED, SNATCHES the paper, walks off, & tells me to & I QUOTE VERBATIM ""Go purchase at the other dealership then! Why are you here?"" Excuse me?

I could not believe my eyes nor my ears! I politely walked to the front desk to ask his information. Leo returns & I explain to him what just happened, how rude & disrespectful that was. Leo tells me I can't call competition to ask about the same car & that the director doesn't want to 'deal w/ that'. Excuse me? The ONLY reason he doesn't want to deal w/ it because he KNEW he was LYING. As a BUSINESS you get customers by market competing! That is literally the model of business no matter what industry you are in!

I presume while I was headed home; they talked. Leo reached out & said they would do the deal if I accepted the numbers offered by the director. I told him I didn't get a clear look at everything, because the director snatched the paper so fast. NO RESPONSE. The ONLY way I would still purchase from here is IF I got the Sentra SV at listing price & a match on my trade-in. Other than that; I would NEVER DO BUSINESS HERE & I advise ANYONE else to NOT do it either. That is no way to treat NEW or any customer for that matter.",1.0

My salesmen Jeffery stated if purchased he would have the ac checked in which he did.  The vehicle was purchased in good faith with a “We Owe You” document issued to have the AC check/charged.  The vehicle was left at the dealership to have AC checked and inspection completed.  Originally the car did not pass inspection but the dealer corrected the issue to pass the state inspection.  On 06/12/2019 I was contacted to take delivery of the vehicle.  Vehicle was pick up and I immediately noticed the air was not getting cold the car was returned to the dealership, the salesmen once again stated he would have the car checked and assured me that the service department had checked it before.  On 06/17/2019 I contacted the dealership to get a status up because I has heard nothing on my vehicle.  At that time, I was notified that too much money had been lost on this deal and they were not going to put out any more money; I was offered my money back because it was a cash deal.  
Problem 1: The car was parked on the indoor showroom sales floor with a promise that a complete inspection had been done. This was clearly a miss on the Service Department that initially serviced the vehicle not to mention the total cost of service was reflected on the buyers’ order.  I decided to keep the car and took delivery on of vehicle on 06/20/2019.  I picked vehicle up at 3:00 pm and went an auto mechanic who completed AC work in less than 1.5 hours and $400.

139,"June 22, 2019","UPDATE: Emailed James, owner loyalty manager, and received a call from him on 6/24.  He fully supports the technician’s recommendations.  None of the charge will be refunded.  When questioned specifically about 2 “critical” recommendations, he provided the following answers: 1) How did the tech determine the transmission fluid level was low when the next shop found it to be normal?  James referenced the a picture of the outside of what I assume is the transmission attached to the repair recommendation.  The “splatters” is what indicated to the tech that the fluid level was low.  2) One “critical” recommendation was to replace both the engine and in cabin air filters.  When informed that both had been replaced approx. 13,000 miles ago, James stated that Nissan recommends both filters be replaced every 3,000 miles.  Per my Altima maintenance schedule, it’s 15,000 miles for the in cabin and 30,000 miles for the engine.  Obviously, James is not a “certified Nissan technician”.  However, if this is how the dealership and Nissan train their technicians and owner loyalty managers to make and defend “critical” recommendations, perhaps I need to rethink what vehicle I will purchase next.

Do not take your car here for service.  Took my 2013 Altima in to have them check a noise that might be coming from the transmission.  They replaced the transmission under warranty less than 2 yrs, 36000 miles ago.  Charged me 1 hr of labor ($160+$24 shop fee) for 30 mins of work and said the transmission needed to be replaced for ~$4500 - low fluid level and leaking.  Also recommended another ~$2300 in critical maintenance/repairs, most of which had been been done by my mechanic within the last year.  Took the car for a 2nd opinion at a shop that specializes in transmissions - fluid levels fine, no codes, no noise they could hear, drove fine, some possible seepage but no leak.  Recommendation was to just keep an eye on it - no charge for this.  Have contacted the dealership multiple times asking for refund - general manager, client care manager, service manager - no response.  This is the 2nd time they have recommended unnecessary, expensive repairs.  Do not take your vehicle here for service unless you want to pay a premium for unneeded repairs.",1.0

I had been working on restoring my credit and just hoped to get into a vehicle with as little money down as possible.  After working with me for almost a month, Domingo and Dario said that the perfect car showed up and they would like to send my deal over to the bank for review.  To my surprise!  The bank approved my deal with NO MONEY DOWN!  To make things even better, they called the bank and got them to lower the rate, if only I would put a little bit of money down to help my deal look better.  My interest rate dropped almost two full points AND my payment dropped over $50 a month!  Talk about blowing my expectations out of the water!  The kindness and professionalism shown to me by Domingo and Dario will not be forgotten.  Thank you so much for all you hard work, your patience and your determination to go the extra mile.

The got me in there and after being there for four hours they said I needed to put a down payment. I drove down with my wife and kids. Had they not lied I would have never came down. They pulled a bait and switch to get me in the dealership. It seems they don’t care if someone spends $50 in gas. I complained to the customer service manager. All he did was listen and little else.

193,"March 22, 2019","We have be purchasing fleet of NV2500 vans from Central Houston Nissan past couple of years.  We have about 12 NV2500 in our fleet.  Every single one of the van have had warranty issues with catalytic converter and fuel pumps.  I am amazed how Nissan has not issued a recall on this yet.  For the most part Central Nissan has taken care of my warranty issues until today.  This NV van had 60K miles and I was told by service adviser Anthony that its out of warranty since the catalytic converter has a 50K mile warranty.  I explained to him all my other van had the same issues.  He advised me the cost will be around $3500 for repairs.  Knowing this is an ongoing issue with these vans I wondered why wouldn't NISSAN warranty this one on good faith.  Anthony suggested that if I had done their recommended fuel service then this wouldn't have happened(this angered me more then the $3500 bill)   I told him I even had brought the same vehicle in around 30K miles and had service adviser David Navarro check on the same issues.  He assured me nothing was wrong with this one and noted on my account if the issue arise after warranty that he would take care of it.  After I complained and told them the situation was documented in my account prior to the expiration of my warranty,  they offered to pay 80% of the cost to repair.  I don't understand that if they admit guilt and will pay 80%, why don't they pay the entire balance.  This is obviously a defect and should be a nationwide recall.  But instead of taking ownership of the problem, Nissan tries to pass the cost to consumers. THIS SHOULD NOT BE TOLERATED.  I will continue to send this message to anyone in Nissan that will take my concern seriously.  This will be posted to all Nissan social media account until I get a response.  This is terrible service especially to a customer that has a fleet of Nissan vehicles.  I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER NISSAN AGAIN!",1.0

She told me it did not matter, I would be approved for any amount $0 down.

I called Saturday morning before I head down there, it is a 45 minute drive for me and everything is getting put together should have everything ready for me to sign when I get there. Instead of calling me so I don't waste my time. I drive 45 minutes down there to find out that I cannot get the vehicle I chose the night before without $5,000 down. So I choose a less expensive vehicle go down $ $10,000 come back with that could finance that with $3,000 down and that I need to stick with a Nissan because they have more options of financing.  And then because it was a truck it is harder to get financing for a truck so I went to an SUV, and I'm now I'm told they can Finance it with 1500 down as I went down in the cost of the vehicle another $5000. They do not call in down payment they call it a bank fee or get a cosigner so 0 down never happened unless you have wonderful credit and make $10,000 a month.

However he failed to mark down the vehicle I wanted to purchase so the following day I went to finalize the paperwork I found out they had SOLD the vehicle I wanted. I was upset at first but then was told they would see what they could do to assist me because it was a ERROR on their behalf.  I was told I had gotten approved with a bank while test driving the vehicle and we were good to go, only to find out from the sales Manager Giovanni that I was DENIED but the bank hit them a 3k bank fee. Correct me if I am wrong, if I got denied or needed a NEW CO-SIGNER as he stated why would the bank want a fee ( a fee in which the dealership eats the cost of ). He stated that this was a fee I should be paying and because I wasn't putting a down payment down I needed a new co-signer. I have been approved with other dealerships and have also been told by other dealerships that a ""bank fee"" is a fee the dealerships cover and really shouldn't even be discussing this fee with customers. Not him though. I refuse to do business with anyone or any dealership that will continue to mislead their customers. Had he would had been upfront with everything it could have been a deal upfront.

287,"April 17, 2018","The new car purchase process is rarely a painless exercise but there were definitely some highlights when dealing with Marc and Felicia at Central Houston Nissan.

I worked out pricing with Felicia via email before coming into the store, I found her through TrueCar.  Their pricing was really competitive, and the quote transparently listed the add-on's and fees.  When I showed up at the dealer we met with Felicia who introduced us to our salesman Marc Robinson.  Marc was great, he had the car we came to see pulled up to the front, ready for drive.   After a successful test drive we told him we would take it.

Having bought several cars at many dealerships I'm familiar with how the process works.  Even though we had agreed to price via email, I was waiting for the moment when we would have to re-negotiate the deal, for whatever reason.  And sure enough that moment came, where the sales agreement had a price far higher than what was agreed to via email.  When I explained that the only price I was interested in paying was the one agreed to by email, they changed the sales agreement to match the email price.  It was a pretty quick exchange and was really the only moment where I felt like I was back in the bad old days of car buying.  But again, the price was corrected without much fuss and we were back on our way toward the finance guy.

288,"April 13, 2018",NIGHTMARE STEALERSHIP! Bought my 2017 TITAN there on March 30 2018 and paid$1250 Utimate Protection Plan for tires n wheels. First they low ball me for my trade in. Took the truck home.  Truck had 600miles already . 5spots of touch up paint on left driver door. Plus a damaged tire(wall). Came back service told me Tires n Wheel program won't cover it bc it irregular case. Service manager excused me for drove flag n damage the tire n refuse to cover it. After argument. They agreed to cover it but don't have the tire in stock(how do u Not have your Oem tires in stock?) I came back next day they told me the replacement tires damaged bc it at the bottom of the stack of tires(lol tire got damaged bc 5 tires stack on top) spent total 7 hrs to replace tires that someone at dealership drove new truck n ran flat on. Which I had tires protection for. Anyway I canceled my $1250 protection program. Won't never go back to this dealership again. BUYER BE AWARE ! !!

296,"February 25, 2018","I went to trade in my car yesterday at this dealership. Evan was my car salesperson and he was pleasant to work with. I was comfortable with him. He did his job. He was helpful. It was great. Better than I expected out of a car salesperson. 
My experience was pleasant until I was taken to the financing department. I was introduced to Darrell Polk. He tried pressuring me REALLY hard to buy their dealership warranty for my new car. Which made no sense Due to the fact that it’s still under the factory warranty. He tried to convince me otherwise though. I’ll spare some of the details, but I basically kept telling him “no”. After about the 6th or 10th time asking, changing the price, and getting denied his tone and attitude changed.  He would murmur things under his breath, such as how he was trying to help me out and basically shaming me the majority of the time I was in his office for not choosing to purchase their dealership warranty. He would do obnoxious things like slam his pen down on the desk or aggressively pull apart the paperwork after I’d finished signing each document. It got to the point where I felt extremely uncomfortable and wanted to leave. He’d completely rubbed me the wrong way. He was rude. He made it hard for me to even enjoy driving my new car off the lot, because of the treatment I got from him. Maybe this all wouldn’t have been so bad if i hadn't had to go to this place by myself. 
So, once I’m done with Darrell Polk, I go into a waiting room and wait for them to bring me my keys. Then I’m told to pull up Central Houston Nissan on google on my phone and they asked me to write a review right there on the spot because the manager or whom ever was in charge was expecting to see it or something like that. I couldn’t understand why they were literally trying to make me write a review before I’d even received my car. I just looked down at my phone screen and couldn’t help but feel pressured to write something positive. I felt like I was being monitored? It was weird. I think they were expecting me to write the review and show it to them for approval before I left. They finally told me I could go ahead and write it later after they could see that I was annoyed/confused for being asked that and not willing to comply. I told them I’d needed time to process and would do it later, so here I am. I wanted to do an honest review and it wasn’t going to happen right there. 
I really hope they aren’t doing this to other female customers. 

To sum up my experience at this dealer:
-Evan (car salesperson) he’s excellent at his job! No complaints!

-Finance department (Darrell Polk), terrible! 0/10  Had I known it was going to be that way I probably would’ve never come to this place. 

-Whoever told their employee to come tell me to write a review right then and there, GARBAGE!

It makes me question how many of these “positive” reviews were from customers that were told to write theirs on the spot too. Never doing this again. I don’t feel right recommending this place to others, so I won’t. ",2.0

So after deciding on a vehicle, I drove the 4 hours on my 1 day off to do the deal. Well I wish I had read these reviews first. It started off with me not working with this ""Jacquel"" at all. I don't even know if this person is real. Instead I had Shan. Gave him all my paperwork, then he wanted 3 months of bank statements. Gave him those. Still have not seen the vehicle. I should have known something was amiss. He started asking about payments, etc. I told him I didn't know if I even wanted to buy yet, I needed to see and drive the vehicle. Finally we go and drive it. He obviously knew nothing about it because he could not answer any of my questions. I knew way more about it than he did. I still was going to purchase it for my son, it was a nice jeep at a decent price. We go back to the office and he says ""the bank has a counter offer, they want $5000 down, a cosigner, or need you to trade a vehicle."" This is when I got upset. I told him I would not have wasted my entire day, driven 4 hours, etc if I had know that. Why did they tell me I was already approved? He says ""sorry for the misunderstanding. I told him it was no misunderstanding that the straight up lied to me and it it was bullsh.t. I got out to the hall and got a little loud which got the attention of most of the people around and left. What a crock. We bought a 72K Infiniti in August and were treated so well.

 They send out manipulative advertisements that trick and deceive people to thinking they won prizes. I suspected it was and even called their call center and front desk to verify  and they both appeared to say it was true. I should have known it was a fake, the call center they use was rude, careless, and even hung up the phone. 

I've contacted their upper management like Chris Gates, Chad Millow, and J. Leon as well as their owners and even Nissan consumer affairs to complain about their lying sales director/manager but they avoided my calls and refused to take responsibility. A sales manager I spoke to at the dealership even lied and gave me incorrect contact information for upper management even after I confirmed it with him.  I in vain, even tried reaching their customer service manager and he ended up doing nothing as well. He did reach out to upper management, but they didn't want anything to do with it or resolve a customer's issue. 

The actual stupid small thing I was told I was entitled to win, they even ran out of at the dealership . And they make you jump through all these hoops for the prize and you don't even get it. xxxxxxxx! This has turned me and my wife off at even considering a Nissan brand vehicle at all in the future. I'll stick to a Honda or Toyota. John Eagle Honda's service is top notch and I've never been ultimately disappointed with them. And even after all my complaints to upper management they still had the gall to send another deceptive advertisement to my and other's homes to look for more customers.

Found 2015 vehicle on TrueCar.  I received & printed and Price Protection Certificate so i would have no haggle pricing. Went to dealership would not honor pricing On all used vehicles you will be expected to pay 1,000 to 3,000 fee which is strictly profit purposes. They waive this fee for some customers and won't budge.  So a price protection certificate will do you no good.  (They call this a Prep Package Fee""  but they cannot give you break of down of Prep Work done.  Do your research online first look up specifically BBB website.  Look up specifically for Used Car Sales for Central Houston Nissan. Also when came to finance paperwork there were additional fees that were added on top of final numbers not your normal TTL.  I had all my research in hand so i caught most of hidden fees. For next issue we traded in a very nice SUV.  It has been over 30 days and they still have not paid off my trade in so now it shows I am late on payment for a vehicle that has been at their dealership posted for sale and i am showing late on a payment on a car.  Please do your research so you know what to look out for before going to this dealership. The well sell you a line that they will prep a vehicle to make sure it is safe for your family is part of the fee.  Driving purchased vehicle from dealership i had a blowout late at night on highway.

Bull S***t they are crooks stay away I have also notified USAA since they financed the deal.

354,"September 20, 2017",I asked this morning if the truck I wanted was still available and if I could come look at it this evening. The rep Cristal Torres told me it was still there and scheduled me to look at it around 7. I drive 2 hours to get there. I show up and can't find it. They tell me it wasn't there because it had been loaned out for several days. It was extremely frustrating because they knew I was coming from 2 hours away and they did nothing to let me know it wasn't there. They just encouraged me to come anyways and waste my time and gas money. Very unprofessional.,1.0

356,"August 21, 2017",I am a returning Nissan owner (fourth car) and I can say that each experience is different. I went to the dealership on a Friday afternoon just to discuss the options I had for returning my Altima since the lease was expiring. I had previously had an experience with this dealership that was less than stellar but I didn't want to judge them too harshly based on one bad experience. Mr. Jackson was recommended to me by Mr. Rovelo who greeted me immediately as I entered the lobby area. I found Mr. Jackson to be very approachable and honest. He understood that my previous experience was still concerning to me but was extremely thankful that I was willing to give them another opportunity. He also understood what type of vehicle I wanted and worked hard to find something that he knew would meet my specifications. He really made the experience smooth and efficient. I was able to ground my Altima and sign all the paperwork for my new Maxima in just a little over 90 minutes. I then left for a bit to allow them to clean the car. I returned and was met by Mr. Jackson who alerted me that the car had a small cosmetic defect in the paint on the passenger side bumper. I was so thankful that he was absolutely truthful with me regarding the damage as I would not have noticed it without him pointing it out for me. The scheduling for the repair was done quickly. I then was thoroughly introduced to the amenities in my new vehicle by Ms. Lee. She did an extremely thorough job of walking me through what is a very technically heavy process since the systems were different from my previous car. Overall this was definitely the best experience so far (even with the paint problem) and I cannot express how impressed I was with the professionalism of this team. ,5.0

I was told BOTH times they had the keys and would hold them for my appointment. I walk in after being in traffic for over an hour with a screaming infant, and was told the van had been taken home by an interested customer who was testing it out for a few days. Immediately I asked for a manager. Found out the people who answer the phones are paid by how many people they get to come in, so basically she gave me bad information just to get me into the dealership. My husband had come into the same dealership the week before to look at a vehicle and was also told over the phone it was still in the lot but once he got there it was sold. WASTE OF TIME. I have NEVER been lied to so many times. Will never do business here.",1.0
359,"August 04, 2017","Purchased a used car a while back from Central Houston Nissan. Had a pleasant experience with the dealership overall, no complaints on paperwork or other buying related hoops. The particular salesman we dealt with was another story completely. Chris Bennett was our salesman. The experience started with Chris giving me a description of the vehicle via email full of false information. ""Only has XXXXX miles!"" - had 9,000+ more miles than he stated. ""Came from a home with no pets!"" - back seat had dog hair stuck all over the place, etc... 

Didn't really care about those things, but his dishonesty about simple things should have tipped us off to what kind of person he was. When my family and I went to purchase the car, we met with him in his office to begin the process. His manner and demeanor were incredibly unprofessional, telling inappropriate jokes and using explicit language in front of my two young children over and over again. Once we had signed paperwork, he couldn't locate the second key for the vehicle, so he provided a ""spare"" that we could just ""have programmed"" later. We also asked for roof rails which he agreed to and were ordered at the time of sale. 

When I came back to the dealership a couple of days later to have the ""spare"" key programmed, it turned out Chris had just taken a key from a different vehicle and passed it along to us. It wasn't the ""5 minute fix"" he had suggested, it took the better part of two hours. The service desk also asked ""who will be paying for this?"" I explained that it was the key provided when I purchased the car a couple of days before, and that they (the dealership) would be paying for it. I could tell this wasn't an isolated incident when the person at the service desk asked who had told me it was an ""easy fix"" and just rolled their eyes and said ""of course"" when I told them it was Chris. 

Additionally, I was told the roof rails that were ordered for me would only take a week for delivery. I called a week later to inquire, but was told they had not yet arrived. I waited another week to call back and I was told they were ready to be picked up. I was not contacted, I had to initiate the contact. However, when I arrived to pick up the parts, they couldn't find them. Turns out Chris had apparently given them away to another car buyer to ""sweeten"" another deal he was working on! So the parts had to be re-ordered, and I had to wait another two weeks before I finally received the items. 

Lastly, as part of the car purchase, Chris informed me and my wife that ""Oil changes were included for 2 years!"" Unfortunately, when I took my car in for an oil change, I was told this was not the case, and Chris had lied about yet another detail. 

Overall I love the car, but I will never use this dealership again. The fact that they employ someone who uses these underhanded tactics and comports himself in such a trashy manner in front of customers' families says all you need to know. ",3.4

Derrian Brown was my salesperson and he was absolutely wonderful from the beginning to the end.  After I signed the papers I waited a month to pick up my car because it was a birthday gift to myself.  Derrian took pics of the car for me with the plastic still on it when it came in.  The day I picked it up he had it washed and moved it to the showroom floor because he didn't want one speck of dirt on it when I arrived.  I met several managers and everyone was so nice and seemed to really like their jobs. The Finance Department didn't try to pull anything funny with the numbers either.

Upon arrival at the dealership the follow day Mr. Price refused to sell the car at the agreed on price he furnished me via email in writing and added over $2,000 to the original quoted drive our price. I read back to him verbatim the email he sent me and asked why he was reneging on the agreed on offer. He only comment was, ""they are re-running the numbers and I cant sell the car for that."" I reminded him that he had also sent me a text message telling me that he had gotten the agreed on drive out price approved by his Sales Manager. He again stated, ""they are re-running the numbers and I cant sell the car for that."" This entire incident has been reported to Nissan Consumer Affairs. Copies of the email I received from Mr. Price have been sent to the Houston Better Bureau and to True Car.

Good afternoon Mr. xxxxxx,
 
This is Jerrell Price from Central Houston Nissan, we spoke earlier today on the phone.  I apologize for the delay but I was making sure we found the right vehicle with the features you are looking for.  I need to ask you a few questions about the Altima you're looking for.  Did you want the Technology package on the vehicle?  If so, I have one in pearl white.  The invoice price which is the price the dealership owns the car for is $34,034. The MSRP is $35,895 plus tax title and license. I can sell you the vehicle at the invoice price of $34,700 minus the rebates which is $3,000 bringing the vehicle price down to $31,700 plus your tax, title, and license.  In this situation I want to earn your business and take care of our law enforcement.  Down worry about the price of the tax, title, and license.  For you it will just be $31,700 drive out.  If you want the Altima SL without the Technology package, then your drive out will be $30,656.  It was a pleasure speaking with you earlier.  Give me a call and let me know what I can do to earn your business.

379,"May 26, 2017",I recently visited the dealership for a vehicle that seemed to not be there and I was highly upset about that. I got a sales consultant by the name Kiana Davis and she treated me outstanding.

They claimed this fee was for service, maintenance and to recoup fees for the repossession of the vehicle.  I understand needing to recoup your fees but it should be added to the price not simply an add on after someone tries to purchase the vehicle.  To their respect they did call me prior to me making a 6+ hour round trip journey to buy it but its still a bait and switch they just thankfully alerted me to it before I came in and caused a scene.",1.0

392,"May 13, 2017",We drove from all the way from Austin made an appointment and when we got there we were told that the vehicle was sold couple hours ago. This particular vehicle was up for sale since few months and suddenly sold the same day we got there. We were pressured into buying another vehicle.,1.5
393,"April 18, 2017","My husband made an appointment with the online sales department to come in and see a car as well as test drive the vehicle before purchase. He asked them very specifically that we wanted to see the Rogue SL 2017 with platinum and premium packages because we were very interested in the safety features. The girl on the phone named Jerika, mentioned that they didn't have it in stock but they would be able to get it for our test drive on Saturday. Sure enough, we show up at our appointment time, no one was able to pull up our appointment and no one knew why we were here. Fine. We talked to the salesman, James Adams and we explained our situation, having shopped around at different dealers in Houston and going to Gulf Coast thinking that there would be a platinum package Rogue SL there in the color we wanted, and ultimately not being able to test drive it because the salesman made the mistake of showing one that was just a premium package Rogue and we walked away from that one. James assured us that he was able to get it, ended up pulling a car to test drive, but lo and behold, it was the same issue as the Gulf Coast Nissan. Premium package- he didn't verify that it also had Platinum package on there. We came back into the office so that James could see if they had it (cars moved around in different lots due to construction). During the time we were sitting in the office, the online sales department called him twice to ask him why we weren't able to make it in to see the car. My husband was very frustrated at this point, but instead decided to ask the online sales department if they were able to pull up the VIN of the car she specifically said would be available so that James could have an easier time finding it. She responded by saying that they were not able to look it up in their system, which I think is ridiculous. If you are mentioning that you have a car, shouldn't you confirm with someone who is able to pull up the VIN and make sure it is absolutely there before scheduling a test drive? Ultimately they did not find it, however James was able to locate one at David McDavid who they could trade with. Either way, we decided that regardless of whether or not the vehicle was here, we needed to negotiate price or walk. They said they would beat any price(we wanted x amount of $ off MSRP and 0% financing offered by the manufacturer currently) and we got to financing, and were told we wouldn't be able to get 0% financing (without even pulling our credit which is excellent, btw). This frustrated both of us, and we were very close to walking out of the dealership as we had been dealing with back and forth all day and not having consistent answers from most of the team. As they were able to finally give us the deal that we promised and finally able to test drive the car that was driven over from David Mc David, we went through with the deal. Finance did give us honest answers and quotes, but after hearing conflicting information all day, and having tensions run high, there's a chance that many will not even make it to that point. If there is any advice I have to give you, stick to your guns and make sure that they are giving you terms that are consistent. James Adams, our first salesman was the only one who was trying to really diffuse the situation and actually drove over to David Mc David to pull the vehicle himself. I appreciate his effort, but wished we didn't have to deal with so much back and forth. We walked into the dealership at 9 am, and didn't close the deal until 630. ",3.0

He talked to us like normal people, he wasn't trying to just make the sale, he really did want us to enjoy what we were getting and be happy with the final numbers.  He was easy to communicate with and very energetic - exactly what you want in a salesman.

Nancy was fantastic as well.  She was so helpful and showed us every physical aspect of our new car and how it functions. The way the dealership assigns 3 people to help you is so well organized and you always know who to talk to.

Despite being new, she was very friendly and personable. Maya was very different from any other salesperson I've met, because she wasn't just trying to sell a car, which I really appreciated. Mark Murski also helped us. He was very personable as well. Fast forward what seemed like forever (it had been a long day), we finally came to an agreement on the price, with the help of Maya, Murski, and the manager,  Armando. After we signed the initial papers, we did have to wait quite awhile for the finance manager, but I understand because they were very busy.  The finance manager was also very friendly. I will say that, like some other reviews state, I was told one final price that I signed initially and once I got to the finance man, the price was suddenly increased, with random charges and a higher interest rate than I was told. However, any other issues or concerns we had, they were very quick to address them and make us happy.

He was told before we even came in the exact vehicle I wanted and all the details we had to work with. He was very responsive and easy to work with, also kept us from spending hours at the dealership. In my mind, he deserves a five star review, as it was a pleasure to work with him. Now, why I'm giving four stars, after we had worked out all the details over the phone and via email, we went to pick up my vehicle and got to financing and were being thrown numbers completely off from what we had previously discussed. The financing department claimed nothing is exact until you sit down. As soon as I told Chris about this issue, he promptly was working to resolve it. It was very pleasant to work with someone straight forward who seems to genuinely care about his customers and I sincerely appreciate everything he did to get me in my new murano. ",4.6

402,"March 09, 2017","I went to the used dealership after being called about an online inquiry I made about a 2016 Mazda 6, when I came to my appointment they were had no idea I was coming. I am in sales myself and thought that maybe the line of communication had been dropped but still gave them a chance. I test drove the car and it was closing time because I live an hour away and work but the sales man Mark M. had me take the car home and come back the next day -  again this is not at all convenient being that I live an hour one way from the location of dealership and also drive an hour the opposite direction to work . I took car home and it was not even half way home that I realized I was not going to buy the car due to it being extremely hard uncomfortable seats and with my commute to work that is not what I want to pay a car note for . I called the sales man the next morning to inform him that after work I would be bringing the car back and not keeping it, So when I got there he had another vehicle a Mercedes Benz ML 350 pulled out for me to drive after my test drive he told me to take it home and we would talk again after the holiday weekend which means I was to take it home for 3 days. My mom fell in love with the car and I told her that they had two of them to buy so when Tuesday came around me and her went up there so she could also test drive the other one. I was told by my sales man Mark that he would be able to lower the price of the car and especially since we were now purchasing not one car but 2. He lied, everything he told us he was going to work out for us ended up not being true after we went to the financing department. My co-signer has actually been illegally added as a buyer for the car and they ran so many hard credit pulls that it took a huge toll on both our credit scores. My mom was told that she still had a warranty for another 20,000 miles by Mark but then found out that she did  not when at finance which means that she had to now purchase one which raised the price of the car yet again. They were supposed to send me a copy of the financial papers and sale of car since they had to come out to my co-signers house to get his signature yet even though I have called I still have not a single piece of paperwork about my car. The windshield was to be serviced for the crack in it and I was told any problems my mechanic found they would take care of, well both my car and my moms car needed new tires and brakes and they have not returned my call and told my mom they would do hers but then only honored the brakes being fixed. 
This place rushed us through every aspect of the sale and they were very unprofessional and misinformed about their inventory. They will lie, cheat, and scam their customers to make a sale instead of treating them right and keeping them as customers for life. What a horrible way to run a business. This is exactly why people hate sales people and give ""SALES MEN AND SALES WOMEN A BAD NAME""  I AM IN NEW HOME SALES AND FIND THIS TYPE OF CUSTOMER SERVICE TO BE REPULSIVE. ",1.0

407,"February 21, 2017","A friend asked me to help them and co-sign for a vehicle.  They came to my home with sales person (Tommy Cunningham) and paperwork,  when reviewing paperwork I noticed only my name was on the paperwork,  when I asked about this the Tommy about it, he informed me the other persons paperwork was at dealership but he would email me copies.  Can't believe I feel for this but I did. At the toward the end I learned they had not obtained insurance.  Tommy gave his word no keys would be given till they showed proof.  He said that the dealership would cover the vehicle till they did but I insisted no keys till proof which he agreed.  He took a copy of my insurance to as he said show the finance company that I'm a responsible person. 
This is all I heard till about two weeks later when I got a call from my insurance company that the vehicle was in an accident.  I came to dealership to find out why they gave the keys without my authorization and I was informed that Tommy Cunningham is no longer with them. His supervisor stated they had numerous similar complaints against him.
Clearly I was was dumb for believing Tommy but at same time Tommy Cunningham did lie. There was no other paperwork,  I am the only person on the contract and therefore he should not have given the keys cause I clearly instructed him not to.
My insurance did cover the car and made the repairs so all is good there but I had no choice but to surrender the vehicle back to the bank, but been sitting here for over an hour and a half now because I am being refused help to get reimbursed for the gap and extended warranty.  One person came out and said I have to come at hours I'm not available to come in yet they are open.

I came to Houston to buy a new Leaf with 150 miles on it, and he was very savvy with me as he knew that I wasn't your average buyer.  I had almost all the details worked out before stepping foot in the dealership.  When I arrived my beautiful new Black on black Leaf was all shiny and waiting for me in the showroom.  The Salesperson he matched me with did an outstanding job with all the follow up before any paperwork began.  Tierra was not only knowledgeable about the Nissan Leaf, she had a great attitude even though she was just working with some not so easy to deal with customers, you know who you are!  Great infectious personality makes you feel comfortable at these stressful times!  Armando has put together a stellar team here I can tell they want to give you a great deal no matter what it takes.  I would never hesitate to call Armando in the future or refer a friend to him in need of a great Pre-Owned vehicle at Central Houston Nissan.  They have won a customer for Life here even if I need to drive from Austin, and then turn around and figure out a route home, you must plan ahead with a Leaf, if you decide to do it just call Armando and I will alert him of the best route from Houston to Austin without a flatbed!  Tierra, thank you for making this the best car buying experience Evah! you should be proud of yourself as you are doing great work, and made me feel like a special customer even though we just met!

410,"February 13, 2017","If you are the type of person who enjoys being lied to then this is the greatest dealership on planet earth. I called ahead and asked if a vehicle was in stock, I was told it was. I drove 40 mins to check it out only to be told it had been sold the day before. They then informed me that they had other cars for sale as well. Seriously, they have more than one car for sale. I was shocked! Beyond disbelief that a car dealership would have more than one car on the lot (but not necessarily the car you want to look at). I highly recommend this dealership to everyone who enjoys being lied to. If they are willing to lie about something as small as what they have in stock just to get you in the door, what else will they lie about?",1.2
411,"February 09, 2017","We had a HORRIBLE experience at the Central Houston Nissan dealership. If I could give a zero star I would. This place does not sell cars, it is a place that lies to the customer. They will try their best to trick you into paying more money for the price of the car than you agree to.

We were interested in one car, and the manager agreed to a total price of $23,800 drive out (which included tax, license, documentary charge and fees). But when they did the paperwork, the finance person added an extra $ 1,429.28 which was never acknowledged by us and meanwhile he offered several additional warranties to let us buy, to draw our attention away from this extra charge.


The following is what we are agreed to for pricing
Drive out (including tax, license, documentary charge and fees)	$23,977.19 
trade in car	($7,800)
Extend service	$926 
Maintenance package	$480 
Rebate (this rebate is 
promotion for use finance service) 	($1,500)
 Total finance	$16,083.19 


The following is what the dealership charged us 
sale price(should have included tax, license, documentary charge and fees but did not)	$23,977.19 
Theft protection	$100 
trade in car	($7,800)
sale tax	$923.57 
Vehicle inventory tax	$47.71 
license fee 	$153 
Inspection fee 	$7 
title 	$33 
Documentary charge	$165 
Extend service	$926 
Maintenance package	$480 
Rebate (this rebate is 
promotion for use finance service) 	($1,500)
Total finance	$17,512.47 

Since we had our two year old son with us, my husband and I had to alternate talking to the finance person which he took advantage of.  He never showed us a detailed breakdown of the charges. He just told me that my husband could sign the paperwork when he brought my son back from the  restroom. Because we had a trade in car, had some financing, and bought some additional warranties, and had up to a $1500 rebate, my husband was unable to calculate an exact number so he truly believed the finance person. Although, he didn't show us any paper work or explain in any detail for the charges and just rushed my husband to sign the paperwork.  

After my husband signed the paper work and drove the new car home, we found one indicator light was on, then I asked  to have it checked out. I obviously couldn't buy a brand new car that already had problems. But the salesman just told us to drive a little longer and the light would go away, but it never went off. 

We went home to have dinner and this was when we realized that the invoice amount they charged was not what they told us. My husband immediately went  back to dealership to ask for a refund of the additional charge and they told him their boss was not there now but they would  give us back at least $500 on Monday, which was the next  business day. 

But on Monday, when my husband contacted them they rejected to refund the overcharge amount and said your wife agreed to pay this amount. This is such a big lie. They never showed any paper work to me. I only asked the finance person why they offered 0 percent financial rates and still charge 3.99% of interest rate to us?  Then the finance person said either you can chose $1500 rebate with 3.99% rate or no rebate with 0 % interest rate. The finance person also suggested we choose the $1,500 rebate with 3.99% than taking no rebate with 0 % interest rate. So I chose $1,500 rebate with 3.99% interest rate, therefore we should have SUBTRACTED $1500 from our drive out amount ( $23,800) but they ADDED $ 1,429.28 first AND then deducted $1,500 AND also charge 3.99% of interest rate. We ended up with a rebate of only $70.72. This is trick they are playing.

1. The dealership used the new brake down amount instead of the agreed drive out price to confuse what is the exact price. (They never showed us the breakdown of the pricing before we signed the paper work)

2. The dealership is  mixing up the car price with finance promotion. (to avoid giving us the real $1500 rebate)

Now with the over charge and also the new car itself having problems, we asked for a full refund all money. They rejected again even with the warranty printed on the back of Power Nissan’s service invoice. According to Nissan’s own warranty, Nissan should replace or refund my car. 

I just want to tell all the people that want to buy a Nissan, save yourself the hassle and lies, and never go to Central Houston Nissan dealership.

420,"January 30, 2017","6 months ago, I went into a Nissan dealership to “trade-in” my car for a new one. We went through the whole process, signed necessary paperwork left under the impression that I received a new car through a trade-in. Much to my surprise about a month later I began getting calls from the loan company stating that I was past due on my monthly payment. I was confused so I called the dealership and spoke to the financial manager who informed me that the car was not traded in and that he has no idea where the car was. I spoke to the floor manager and inquired as to what was going on, he informed me there was nothing he could do because I ""made a deal with the dealer so I would have to work things out with him"". After that conversation, I called Nissan’s corporate office who informed me that things would have to be worked out with the local dealership because they only handle ""manufacture problems"". Everyone I spoke to was dismissive as if this wasn’t a problem. Frustrated at this point I spoke with the initial salesman who says that him leasing the car until it is re-financed was always a part of the plan and never trading it in. Thinking I had no other option because I could not afford to pay for two cars I agreed to allow him to lease for a few months until ""the buyer's credit was high enough"". That never happened and then I find out that he was trying to lease the car to someone else but they aren't paying the payments and it is overdue by $1900. Long story short, I recently got the car back, after MUCH hassle, however, I will NEVER return to this dealership or any other Nissan dealership to purchase a vehicle from them. They didn’t even have the courtesy to investigate the case and speak with me about the situation. Not professional at all!",1.0

423,"January 25, 2017","So my biggest complaint (and most obvious lesson) is READ EVERY SINGLE WORD  that you are initialing for. I have an extended warranty and was told that I would have to pay a deductible for any WORK that would be COMPLETED. I waited 25 minutes and had to make it to work, so like any employee (regardless of time/paperwork needed to be done) he summarized what the steps/procedures would be. I am not going to name this new employee that went over this paperwork (I know that he was new because when I called to speak to him the operator told me so because they couldn't find his extension in the first place and even said he was a new employee) but he is not at fault for this. He told me that since I was going through my extended warranty, that I would have to pay a deductible, which is typically normal. We both went over my paperwork that I actually had with me and it would be $100 that I would be paying and the warranty would cover the rest. Please note - I went in for a check engine light and my brake light blinking. After being rear-ended twice in the last three months (covering the cost of one person having no insurance) plus paying for $800 in tires (no, this is not their problem) I specifically said that I needed an estimate before accepting any work that would be done with my vehicle because unfortunately, I couldn't hand over a credit card and pay for whatever was needed. He let me know that the WORK (if covered under warranty) would be my $100 deductible and obviously the warranty would cover the rest. After receiving a quote of over $1,500 (for other reasons that I went in for) I let the new employee know that I would have to pick up my car and think about how would I proceed with everything. When I went to pick up my vehicle, I was told that since my car was diagnosed and the ""problems"" they found were not covered by my warranty, that there would be a $162 charge JUST to diagnose my car. Unfortunately, they had me sign the initial conversation where they spoke briefly about covering the cost of my deductible when there was WORK involved. I didn't see this fine print, or was I told, that I would have to cover a $162 cost of my car simply being looked at regardless of even being worked on and regardless of if my warranty covered the simple diagnosis of my warranty covering it or not. They stated that if my car had been diagnosed with ""warranty"" issues that it would've only charged me the $62 because my warranty would cover the other $100 because of my deductible. However, since my car was diagnosed with issues that had nothing to do with my warranty, I would have to be pay $162 even though work had not be done. I spoke to a manger very confused that this charge was happening. The only positive is that he did waive the fee, after a lot of arguing, but he felt the need to tell me that I shouldn't be upset for this reason - I was going into the shop ""knowing"" (?) that I would have to pay a $100 deductible IF warranty work had been done only to find out that my ""issues"" weren't covered under my extended warranty that I purchased and I would have to pay an additional $62 than what I would have originally planned. As if knowing that when my check engine light came on, I knew if it were warranty or not??? He didn't understand why that would be upsetting in the first place. Their entire argument was that I had a signature.  I then took it to another shop to find out that I didn't have any of the ""issues"" that they had said I had in my quote. Please be careful, which should be a no-brainer in the first place - Read EVERY SINGLE word that is on the document. After even apologizing that I was frustrated in the first place, the manager still went on to say he couldn't understand my frustration for paying an extra ""$62"" because I would've had to pay for that initial deductible from my warranty. It's the principle. I've been in customer service for 10+ years and know that you don't talk to customers that way. Not only dealing with two car accidents where I was read-ended and t-boned (both not my fault) and dealing with medical bills... $62 is still more than what I had mentally prepared myself for. I am thankful that this manager waived the fee but I am extremely disappointed in the way he handled himself and had to point out why an additional amount would be such a problem with me. This post is to educate the people, that I see initial paperwork on a daily basis, with only knowing a summary of what it is told to them by the employees that give it to them, and to educate the people who are in a hurry to go to their jobs where they are struggling with feeding their kids/paying medical bills/etc.- This is a business. That's understood. Please remember that and read and educate yourself as much as possible so that you are not financially hurt by people running that business. I will completely admit that I am at fault for initialing paperwork that I thought was ""summarized"" by this new employee while I was in a hurry to get to work.... but please take your time, read between the lines, know what you're paying for and ask the right questions.

As I walked through the door I was greeted by Mo Virk.  Mo Virk, I was like here we go, i'am not in the mood to be delayed anymore, I just want the part and i'm out.

I specifically requested a 370Z Nismo from the dealership and rather than trying to find the vehicle I truly wanted, they pushed and pushed (specifically that xxxxx Wade Thibideaux) to sell me on a vehicle already on their lot which was a touring model. I asked, well, if no Nismo is available anywhere in the area, including Houston, then I would buy a Touring model but they did not have the color I wanted. He said he would look elsewhere and then came back and said that this was not an option either. I went home, looked up other dealerships (i.e. Houston) and not only found the touring in the color I requested but also a few Nismos as well. I even called to confirm that these were still available! I called Wade the next day and told Wade if he insisted on lying rather than being up front about things, I did not want to make a deal with them or have him with the satisfaction of making the commission on the deal. 

I waited almost two weeks before looking again and on Friday 03/04/2016, I submitted and inquiry to Nissan in Central Houston about a vehicle I found on their site.

Most places make you feel like they are only willing to speak with you if they feel like they can take advantage of you. This store makes it feel like they are trying to earn your business for life.

500,"January 20, 2016","This was the closest dealership to us yet it was the last one we went to. We went to Tom Peacock, Mossy, Sterling McCall(THE WORST), and Baker and were completely unimpressed. No one told us about the 0% APR except for the staff at Central Houston Nissan. My girlfriend has had two Nissans prior to the 2015 Rogue she ended up buying with Central Houston Nissan and so naturally, she went in for a third. Originally my girlfriend wanted a used Rogue but after speaking with Eddie (I believe that was his name) and his supervisor/experienced salesman Shawn (spellcheck) we were totally sold on getting a brand new Nissan Rogue. Instead of buying a used 2013 Rogue with about 34.000 miles we got a brand new 2015 Rogue for just $2000 more. Don't even get me started on that 0% APR..... that was honestly what sealed the deal. Both of the guys were sharp, knowledgeable, and friendly. Even the boy who brought the car up for my girlfriend to test drive was courteous and assisting. Signing all of the paperwork did take a while but it was past closing on a Saturday night so I guess that makes sense. My girlfriend has never financed a car before and debt makes her cringe but after they thoroughly explained to her her financial options, she relaxed a little. The Nissan accountant (I honestly can't remember his name) was quick yet thorough making the rest of the process painless. The 2015 Rogue she purchased had literally just came off of the truck so it hadn't been cleaned and because it was late, we thought it was best to come back and pick it up on Tuesday. When we picked it up that Tuesday, Eddie greeted us and told us someone would be over. Anna Lee (spellcheck, I believe that was her name) came over and had my girlfriend sign a couple of remaining forms then she handed her her car manual and car keys and walked us out to the Rogue. She took her time to make sure that my girlfriend understood every button and switch in her car. She even took a selfie with my girlfriend! I don't really care about that stuff but I did notice that her energy made my girl even happier and for that I am grateful. ",5.0

507,"November 11, 2015","My growing family of 8 was reaching the point to where we were cramped in our Chevy Suburban and were looking for a larger family option for travel. Being that this is not a common request for the general consumer, we were flat out told by other dealerships that they couldn't help us. Being a loyal American auto buyer, it was very frustrating that multiple Ford and Chevy dealers wouldn't give me the time of day to even search the area for any large passenger vans or assist in having one made or delivered. I reluctantly looked at Nissans from the suggestion of a coworker and found the NV passenger to not only be large enough seating wise but also very versatile in the arranging of the seating. I immediately contacted a Central Houston Nissan, where the website said some were available and was introduced to Chris Bennett. I told him what we needed and if he had anything that might work for us, unfortunately there were none on the lot with no outlook on when some might come available. A couple days went by and I received a phone call from Chris who was out of town on his personal vacation. He informed me that he'd just gotten an email that he was to be getting some brand new ones right off the assembly line the next week and he'd call to make an appointment to test drive. Monday rolled around and true to his word Chris verified they were there and the wife and I made the hour and a half drive to go and look, with only 4 of our kids in tow. When we arrived Chris literally gave us the keys and told us a few highlights and said he'd give us some time to look and talk. Great no pressure attitude was very refreshing.

The only thing that will keep them more honest is if we all come together and start affecting their sales and revenue. Otherwise they won't care if you are angry or not.

2. I had called when my plates had come in and asked if someone would be able to attach my plates for me
    I was told that it would not be a problem and the dealership is open till 9
    I went in at 5:30 and was told no one would be able to put on my plates and service was closed-receptionist handed me a flat head screw driver
   I went to the salesmanager, and he did it
3. I was told that there was a warranty on the paint. The Financial advisor had stated ""if a shopping cart hits the car and scratches it, the paint is covered"". Guess what? Its not covered under the warranty-the advisor should be better educated on his products. First lesson of sales-know what you are selling-know your product

At all three dealerships i explained that I was a small business owner, knew exactly what i wanted to buy and had a very limited time to spend at the dealership. Every dealership I went to made me sit with them and go through the normal ""dealership game"" for an hour or two. I had just about given up when  I emailed Central on their website, inquiring about one of the NV200s on their webpage. One day later I was contacted by Chris Bennett. I told him what I wanted and I explained to him i had very limited time to meet. A week later i finally found time to visit the dealership and met with Chris. I was literally there 45 mins to fill out paperwork and i was on the road in under an hour.Everything else was done over the phone.  They even drove to my house in Katy to sign the final paperwork after the deal was complete. Chris not only listened and respected my schedule but he gave me the best price of any other dealership.

The staff (Chris Bennet, Emmanuel and Tony Marinoni were awesome. All three:
H - Heard my needs,
E - Eased my tension, 
A - Attentively listened and 
L - Left me with a positive impression of Central Houston Nissan.   (HEAL)

HEAL is very important role for anyone who deals with people and Central Houston Nissan definitely has THREE  staff members that are exemplary role models for the dealership.

Through him I got a good feel for the car that best fits me and my family’s needs. So after 6 long months I decided the day had finally come to buy an Armada. I had a fair knowledge of what it would cost me too. The process was extremely simple with Chris . I walk in and Chris helps me pick out the color and the trim. We sit down and talk pricing and I told him what I think was fair and reasonable. He got it approved . I have never bought a car this fast in my life. The whole process took less than 2 hours. Chris requested me to return a few days later so that he could explain all the features and functions of the Armada Platinum and when I did he introduced me to Anna who then spent more than hour explaining how everything in the Nissan Armada worked and went through all the features. I was extremely pleased at this kind of service. Thank you Chris and Anna!

When I bought the car Dec. 2013, I was told it was in good shape and even if anything did happen the warranty I bought would cover it. That was not the case at all. Within six months I had to get the alternator, transmission, and two axles replaced. That was two warranty claims which brought my payments so far to $550. By the 8th month the exhaust manifold gave out. Billy and the gentleman who presented me with my papers said if anything went wrong with the car i would be covered by the warranty, but they failed to mention that exhaust issues were the exception. I had to pay $350 to get that fixed. On top of that there was one tire bigger than the other and although they promised to replace my tire pressure sensor, they refuse saying I waited to long. There was no expiration date given.. Even though all of that was irksome, my check engine light just came on two days ago. This is absolutely ridiculous! I paid $13000 plus taxes for that car and in the first year I've already spent close to a thousand just fixing it.

When I took my truck my car was fine but upon pick up in the evening I noticed the vehicle was bouncing tremendously.  At first I thought may be the tire pressure may be too much but driving long distance I started to notice more bounce every time I slowed down.  I decided to check online what causes this unusual bounce in vehicles and I found out that damage to struts/shocks will cause this problem.  I took the vehicle back and ask them what they did and of course the usual response is just replaced the air bag.  The guy who was suppose to bring my car upon delivery after service was struggling for 5 minutes screwing with 4WD stick.  It looked to me he had no idea how to drive a manual and I eventually walked to my vehicle to drive out.  Just because my car is 12 years old doesn't mean the shocks are bad and if it is suppose to go bad then it should happen under my watch and not at the dealer service center.  They have done something but now refuse to admit that they are responsible.  The speedometer was also at 0 miles for TRIP A & B.

So-n-so mentions the lock box with the used car keys isn't working right, but someone who can open it will be back in 10 minute, and invites me to come back in and wait.  Oh, why not.  I go back and that's when so-n-so's ""manager"" comes up with the ""Hey, sorry about the wait, anything else we can show you?"".  Again I say no, I'm just interested in the one van right now  That's when I mention I'm willing to wait the 10 minutes if our starting price is what's listed on their website?  Manager-man asks me how much that was, and I tell him.  He get a real blank look on his face and say's he'll be right back. Goes to the big desk for something, comes back pretty quick and says blah, blah, blah about the listed internet prices do not include the $1800 additional fees.  I didn't say anything out loud, but you all know what I thought.  I told him I'm well aware that there would be taxes, state inspection, license and reasonable doc fees in addition to the listed price, but where the heck does it say on their website or online listing anything about an $1800 fee???  He insisted it's there some place, maybe just real small, but it's there.  I asked him to show it too me and he said sure.  Now guess what?  manager-man walks around a bit, comes back and claims he can't find a terminal or computer anywhere that has internet access.  What a clown.  I took out my phone, pulled up the online listing and asked him to show me where the mention of additional fee was.  He took one look at his van in the add, walked away and never returned.

There's quite a bit more to this story, but I'll end things saying the keys magically showed up a minute after manager-man walked away, I test drove the van and was not crazy about it.  They eventually offered to let me have the van at the online listed price plus a proper tax, license, inspection fee, but I said no thanks.",1.5

After texting with Betsy yesteday afternoon (the day before the appointment) and specifically requesting her to notify me if the vehicle was no longer available, she said okay.  The dealer not only did not have the truck I had an appointment to view, but they had no other inventory in stock.  I am very displeased with the customer service and lack of professionalism that was provided to me.  I took time off of my job to look at a specific vehicle and Betsy had no courtesy towards me and the time that was taken away from me due to the dealer sales tactics.

569,"March 16, 2014","Walked into the dealership to buy a certified pre owned car on Jan 11, 2014. Eric Tucker was the salesman and pitched in a just brought in Nissan Altima as certified pre-owned. Signed the paperwork as certified pre-owned and financed through NMAC. That's when the problems began. I was promised a clean vehicle which will be reconditioned because it is going to be a certified pre-owned. Was called into the dealership to take delivery, which I did and drove off. Mid way to home I realized that the so called certified pre owned car has no running AC!!! 
Called the dealership next day and they said it shouldn't happen and asked me to drive back 25 miles so they can inspect the vehicle. They did the inspection and agreed that the AC was broken. To rectify this, I was offered a service rental till they fixed it. Drove the service rental for 3 weeks (yes 3 weeks) till they fixed the car. Got a call and went in again, returned the service rental and took delivery again. Knowing their shoddy service I checked the AC and would you believe it, it was still not working!!!! Was asked to drive the service rental for another week till they fixed it again and was offered a re-painted rear bumper (had a bunch of scratches for previous owner) as sorry note. Went there again to pick up the car and it was finally derivable after a whole month of paying for it. 

It just keeps getting better though. The vehicle was bought on January 11, 2014 and had not received the metal plates till March 10th. When I called the dealership they said that DMV is backlogged and so its taking longer. Called DMV the same day and they said the dealership has not filed paperwork with them yet!!!!!  So called the dealership again and the evening clerk by the name of Trinidad basically told me that I am lying and that talking to DMV for the plates was a mistake on my part and I am accusing the dealership of wrongdoing. This front desk /evening receptionist is extremely rude, cocky and sassy. I have a firm belief that a company that employs these kind of people will be overall pretty pathetic so politely left a message to some business manager (was forwarded to her after multiple re-routing) that the plates are expiring and asked for a resolution. NO RESPONSE!!!! . Called in the title clerk the next day and she told me ""Yes, we have not filed the paperwork yet (60 days after the car was signed for), we will expedite it now and you should get your metal plates next week. In the meantime, because your plate is expiring we will overnight another paper plate (third one) to you to take care of you in the meanwhile. Well, the plates are expired now and the ""Overnight Delivery"" never came in. Basically I have a certified pre-owned vehicle that I can not legally drive because of the incompetence of the people at the dealership and the sheer arrogance and ineptitude of the employees there. The dealership has already given me 2 paper / temp license plates. The DMV officer told me dealerships can legally issue only one set of paper plates/ temp plate but I guess rules are made for lesser people and Central Houston Nissan is above all rules.

The whole car buying experience at Central Houston Nissan has been horrible. They sold a car as ""Nissan Certified Pre-Owned"" and tried to deliver it without a working AC!! When I complained, they gave me a loaner car while trying to fix the car. It took them 20 days to fix it. While picking up the car I noticed that the AC was still broken, no air was blowing through the vents and so had to leave the car with them again. It took them 10 more days to fix the car again and I finally got the car after a full month of having paid for it. The dealership flat out refused to take the car back and kept giving me a loaner car to drive.

I have made 4 round trips to the dealership during this mess (25 miles each way) and in return for my inconvenience all I was offered a full tank of gas and 4 oil changes which was so pathetic I swore that I will never step a foot in their facility. 

Such dealerships exist in this day and age is something I can not fathom. Please beware of their practices do not fall prey to them.

I am amused by the ""car guy"" negotiations, so we spoke to salesman, then sales manager, then the Sales & Finance Manager. We knew what we wanted to pay, and kept strong to that price. 

Once they decided we were serious, and the price was not unreasonable, they got close enough for us to make a deal. THEN, they gave us 1.69 financing, BETTER THAN OUR OWN CREDIT UNION!

Customer Service is horrendous! If you call them, you will be transferred over and over because no one wants to help you. This morning I was transferred back to the operator TWICE!!! On my last service, Friday, January 3, 2014, I went in to get the 15,000 mileage service done which takes 2 to 4 hours. I had things I needed to do so I decided to rent a car. I waited at the rental desk for 30 minutes as they kept paging the guy-Mike to come help me. After an hour, I went back to the desk and he was there waiting. I did a one day car rental and they charged me $200. I did not understand this as most rentals only authorize the initial amount. When the service center called me to tell me that my car was ready, I decided to take the rental back the same day. Mike, again, was not at the front desk. I went ahead and decided to pay for my service. At the dealership they charge $199 for the service I received, but online they advertise as $182. When I checked in my car, the guy said they would honor the online price instead. He wrote it on my signed paperwork when he took the keys. When I received my bill, the full $199 was charged and he told the lady to refund me. I was very thankful for him on this day. He was the only one that showed me ANY customer service! Back to the rental-- after I paid for my service, Mike had still not returned from ""lunch"". The service rep that fixed my bill said he would check the car in for me, and the cashier said she would email me the receipt showing my refund. I waited 5 days and my refund had still not shown in my account. This morning I called up there and after being transferred so many times I finally reached Shanelle...?? She said my account still showed they owed a refund. I asked her why was it not refunded on Friday when I returned the car and she could not tell me why.

2. Asked us to come over to the dealership saying that the sales consultant is getting the car ready for us. It was a white lie as when we reached there, we were asked to complete the paperwork and were told that the car will be at the dealership in 30 mins-1 hour time frame. 
3. The dealer took our card information and SSN information to get the credit approval in the mean time and ran credit check. We had the approval of the credit as per the salesman and mentioned that he will get back to us as soon as the car comes back to the dealership as their driver is on the way. We waited for 3 weeks until we received any information about the mysterious driver our salesman says that either he is just sending out or is on the way to another dealership to get the car.

I was told that the next appointment was Tuesday Jul 23rd.  I left my vehicle at the dealer so that they could get it in as soon as possible. At 2:00 P.M. on the 23rd I called for an update on my vehicle.  I was told that it had not been looked at and they would call me back.  I arrived at the dealer at 4:00 P.M. after no call back.  I was informed that they had ran a scan on the vehicle but could not figure out the problem. It was back outside while they worked on other vehicles.  I was told to come back in 40 minutes to see if they had a come up with a solution.  I arrived back in 90 minutes and my car still had not been moved.  I was told that the Service Manager had sent a email to Nissan to get a solution to the problem but they had closed for the day. This meant that I would be without my vehicle yet another day after being there for 5 days already. I feel if I would not have called to inquire on the status it would not have been looked at on the 23rd although I had an appointment. I suggested that maybe because I came from a high altitude area maybe that might be the problem. I told them to clear the code and I would just leave. There was no urgency or concern on whatever I decided.  I felt like I was giving them advice on how to repair my vehicle. Still today I have not heard back on what Nissan said about the issue. This is the worst service I have ever received in dealing with my vehicle.  I will not come back to Baker Nissan for anything and will pass this experience on to all of my colleagues.   ",1.8

615,"July 15, 2013","I started looking at cars on the Baker Nissan website.  I wanted to know answers to questions I had on the Nissan Versa.  I wanted a car less than $20,000 brand new not used.  I was connected to Shurhonda Fitzgerald.  She answered my questions every time I thought of something I wanted to know about the car.  She also told me that there was a silver 2013 Versa there.  I asked many questions online because I had cancer and it left me with a permanent trach and physically unable to speak.  After getting enought information on the car, I knew  I had to go over and see the car.  I ask a friend to bring me.  I explained to Shurhonda about my previous wreck in which my car was totaled.  She offered to come and pick me up to bring me to Baker Nissan.  I knew then I had to go see her and buy that car that day on July 10, 2013.  I felt at that moment that I did not want to let her down and not come there.  When I did get there, several sales people met me, my sister, and my friend outside.  But at the door inside was Shurhonda and I knew it was her never seeing her before.  Shurhonda introduced us to Corey Veal and told us he would be helping her.  They were very patient reading my input on my dry erase board which is my mode of talking now.  Together they were the friendliness people I had ever met when purchasing a car.  We went back and forth about the price.  Shurhonda was on her job getting the price I wanted. Cory was there giving advice and so charming.  I felt like had known them forever.  My paperwork was carried to Tony Marinoni, the financial manager.  I got a little nervous thinking this price is going to be more per month than I wanted.  When I went in,  Tony was so very nice and I was at ease.  I got the finance rate I wanted and then some.  Corey made sure my 2013 Versa was ready for me to take home.  To me it was a dream coming true since I had been without a car so long and had to use public transportation being out in the Houston summer weather.  
What I got out of this experience is anyone can sell cars.  But what really sells cars is how people are treated when they meet the sales people.  Some come off like the ""shark"" out to snag you without any feelings toward the customer.  Unlike my sales people, Shurhonda, Corey, and financial manager Tony, I felt very warm and throughly satisfied with them, the car, and this dealership.  That is what makes a ""great"" experience when people who go out of their way to make you truly satisfied you made the right decision to purchase their product.   ",5.0
616,"July 13, 2013","I started the sales process on the Saturday before the July 4th holiday and completed it on the 2nd.  I had seen Chris Bennett's reviews on this site in advance and that was why I asked for him when I first contacted the dealership.  After giving him an idea of the Murano I wanted, he was able to narrow the scope of the transaction by showing me a vehicle that was right on the money as to what I wanted.  Unfortunately for us, one or two credit blemishes existed on our report which prevented us from getting exactly what had been showed.  However, instead of throwing in the towel, Chris scoured his inventory and located a substitute which had all of the ""must have"" features.  His feeling was that it was his job to help find us the best car he could for our needs given our attendant credit and that he would keep working on it until we found a way to get the job done.  While all this was going on, Chris also went out of his way to introduce my wife and me to key personnel so that we would know someone at Baker in each department that we might come in contact with.  I caught myself apologizing for the amount of time I felt like he was spending on us, but he kept saying that it was his job to take care of his customers and put them into the vehicle that would make them happy.  When the deal finally did get done, he personally walked us through the service area and parts area to introduce us to people we might see in months to come during the life of the vehicle and had a chance to joke with some about common friends or backgrounds.  I then had occassion to visit with him briefly on the 4th for him to show me how to operate a couple of other features and, sure enough, he was there and helped me program things in no time.  I think it is important to note to the reader that I'm not a spring chicken and over time had purchased new vehicles in Ford, Chevy, Olds, Buick, Toyota and Chrysler dealerships but had never purchased a Nissan until I read the outstanding reviews in Consumer Reports.  Now, because of how much we like the handling and drive of the Murano, Nissan will be the first place I ever look.  Moreover, given my experience with Chris Bennett, my first call will always be to Chris at Baker Nissan.  If Chris can't get you fixed up, then it probably isn't the right to time to buy...it's that simple.  ",5.0

630,"June 12, 2013","I was not pleased with my overall experience. When i first came to the dealership, BNS,i had to re-fill out all the info that i had already filled out on line, as though my information had been misplaced. then, i was told that my check stubs were ""unclear"" and that i had to get a letter from my employer stating what i made, even though i had my 2 most recent check stubs. This delay caused me, in my opinion, to miss out on buying the car that i actually came there to get. Then once i came back with the letter requested, i was shown some cars that were not even cleaned out and ready for sale or that i absolutely could not afford. So i left. then R.T. called me back saying that they could work out a deal on a specific car. While at home i looked on the website to see about other cars that i would be interested in. So i contacted R.T about the ones i would like to look at. He then told me his manager Nino (initially nice, but in the end extremely rude) could only get me in a specific car that day, one higher than the one i was asking R.T. about. This car (a 2010 nissan altima) was ""certified"" and supposedly a good deal. Even though i didnt want the car i decided to go ahead and buy it. I later found out that being ""certified"" only covered a very limited portion of the vehicle. At this point i am so displeased. i go ahead with the purchase anyway because i really need a car. The car was missing one of the hub caps too. :-(  I  drive the car home and it was fine. Got up and drove it to work the next morning. I went on my break and decided to go to the store only to find out that the car would not start. The battery had completely died. i even went and purchased some jumper cables to try to start it. It would not even take a jump from another car. Not even 24 hours in and i had to call the dealership to have it towed back. :-(! When i expressed my concerns to R.T he told  Nino who then told me that it's not a bad car and that there was no possibility that they would even consider putting me in another one. Then because im so dissatisfied with the whole ordeal i asked to speak with someone above the  both of them. I was then sent to Harmon. He too was initially nice, to my mother and i, then by the end of the conversation, was extremely rude and not willing to see if there was another vehicle that they could get me into. Well, they told me that only because i had purchased the extra warranty to cover all the rest of the car that ""certified warranty"" didnt cover i could get a new battery at no extra charge. The car has been fine since and since it was plainly made clear that there was no chance at getting a different one, i have accepted my car. However,  I was not pleased with my experience in buying a from Baker Nissan South! I have already expressed this to different ones i that i work with and family members, warning them not to go there.

And he got it done.  Honest & friendly is hard to find in a car salesman these days!  Anyway, on to the present day. My lease had about 4 months or so left on it, but I went in anyway to see if I could end it early and get a new car.  I of course went straight for Chris Bennett's desk, since I already know how he does business, and he already knows me.  He goes out of his way to make sure the customer gets what they NEED, and does everything possible to get them what they WANT.  He is also very friendly, and remembers people. I don't just mean their names & faces either.  He has great people skills & is very professional.  Over the years, every time I've come in for maintenance, he's gone out of his way to say hello or have a quick chat to see how I'm doing & make sure everything is ok with the car. He also calls occasionally to check on things as well.  You can tell he is very dedicated to his customers. The experience this time went just as well, and was a bit quicker. It took me a while to decide what I wanted (color, interior, options, etc.) and he was very patient with me, showing me several cars and going on a test drive. I had everything pretty much set & changed my mind, and it was no problem. Chris was able to get me a good deal on the car I ended up going with, and he got it done in a very time efficient manner. No sitting for hours and hours. Chris is the type of guy that likes to really get to know his customers, and he treats them great! I have certainly never received the level of respect and kindness that I get from Chris from any other car salesman I've ever met. I would recommend anyone who is going to buy or lease a car at Baker Nissan South to walk right into his office, you won't regret it! John Mesa was also very kind and definitely very efficient! I expected to be in finance for quite a while, because when I leased my 1st car 3 years ago it took a long time.  However, to my happy surprise, John took care of everything very quickly and the experience was much better than last time.

646,"May 13, 2013","I have just retired my15 year old (1998) Nissan Altima - purchased from another dealership.  I revisited that Dealership but did not like the demeanor of the individuals that initially approached me. 

I called Baker Nissan South, at the recommendation of my Credit Union - that I called a Fleet Manager- Ed Jackson.  I was able to look around and was not talked to in a pushy way. Initially tried to incorporate my visits with my husbands' schedule however we were not able to keep the appointments initially set.  Ed Jackson was very patient and I thought based on the amount of times I had to re-schedule he would just say ""come when you can do not bother to call"" BUT he did not do that. My visits I was accompanied by my daughter instead of my husband and we were able to take our time and tell Ed which vehicles we were interested in. He made himself available even through a family emergency. Based on my selections - Mr. Jackson found the perfect car for me, based on what I liked and showed me a Certified Pre-Owned 2012 Nissan maxima. I LOVE IT!!!! 

Every person involved from opening the door at the dealership to purchasing the car was very professional and friendly. I hope I do not forget anyone but Belenda (the receptionist) has an outgoing personality, with a huge smile. I received a call from someone asking me about my experience thus far and it was before the sale of the car!!!!!  When I had to visit the finance area I was assisted by Tony Marioni (pardon the spelling). Prior to signing the numerous documents, Tony was very thorough explaining each document. He elaborated on areas that I appeared hesitant to sign and needless to say Tony answered all of my questions - even the redundant or dumb ones!  My Salesman - Ed Jackson concluded my Baker Nissan experience by ensuring that I have received all of the documents I should have and when I arrived to pick up my car he went over everything in my ""Glove Compartment"". 

I have already visited the Service Department because all four of the tires had different air pressures - it took 5 minutes to fix it.  So far my entire experience has been awesome and I highly recommend anyone who is nervous or needs assurance while making a 5 year financial change - please see Ed Jackson Belenda and Tony Marioni!!!!

648,"May 10, 2013","Prior to my arrival at Baker South location I worked with Steve Dean and he was very patient in narrowing down the selection of a SUV for my daughter through email.
When I arrived they had a vehicle waiting for me to see. I then decided to look at a few more and Chris was very helpful. After looking at the same vehicle but in two different bodystyles,Chris pointed out the safety features on the one with more options. That helped me make my decision on which vehicle was better suited for my daughter. 
I am so thankful for the service I received in purchasing a vehicle for my daughter.

649,"May 07, 2013","I came into Baker Nissan South inquiring about an add on their website for a new Nissan Versa.  As it turned out the add was incorrect and the Internet Sales Manager, Paul Morgan, apologized profusely.  Such being the case, he and Joseph Makuktu (last name may be misspelled) worked rather diligently to find my wife and I the vehicle we wanted at the best price possible.  Although we ended up spending a bit more than we initially desired, we did purchase a good car (Nissan Sentra) with which we are very pleased.  The only caveat of this experience that I would have changed centers around the financing.  We were told that our credit was good enough to get a financing rate comprable to the rate we received on our last Nissan purchase about a year ago from another dealership.  I also stated that I wanted my payments to be no more than a set limit.  As it turned out (and we were not made aware of this until we signed the papers) our payments were a couple of dollars over the limit and the rate we got was 2% higher so that we could take advantage of $750 cash back, which had already been figured into the price.  The financing employee was helpful in relating how we could refinance and make the best of the situation.  However, this is more hassle than I had hoped to encounter on this purchase.  With the exception of the financing not being explained very well, we liked our experience at Baker Nissan.  I hope that in the future, they will pay closer attention to the customers needs in that one area as they do in every other area.  Over all this was a good experience.  But there are minor areas that could be improved.  ",4.2

655,"April 23, 2013","I had been driving a Nissan Altima for three years. I was in the market to look for another Nisssan, but was in no rush to make any decisions. I stopped into Baker Nissan South one evening after work and met Chris Bennett. I told him that I was not in any hurry to make a decision and that I just wanted to explore my options. He offered great advice and help me narrow down my decision to one car that would work the best for me. We test drive the car and he provided all the information possible about the 2013 altima and everything I would need to know about it. When I left, I was worried that I would be hassled for the next several weeks about purchasing the car. I heard from Chris every now and then to tell me about certain specials, or to ask if I had any questions. I never felt bothered by these phone calls. When it came time that I was ready to buy the car, I called around to many places to see where I could get the best deal. Chris got back to me really quickly with all the information I had asked for and the best deal. I told him that I would be coming in that evening. When I got there, the exact car I wanted was parked out front. It had been cleaned, detailed, and the windows had been tinted. We sat down to discuss option and I decided to purchase the car. He was helpful throughout the whole process and made sure that everything went smoothly. There were no hidden surprises. The weeks following my purchase of the car, he continued to call to check on me and the car. He offered his help and support with the navigation system and figuring out the features of my new car. It really was a great experience to work with him, and in the future I will recommend his buisness to anyone in the market for a Nissan.",5.0

662,"April 15, 2013","This was by far the WORST experience ever searching for a new car for my daughter! Long story, but I do not want to miss anything. It started off with the salesman Joseph not return calls regarding online inventory after I emailed all my personal info and filling out online finance application. I had to call him three different times only to be told he was busy with customers and forgot to return my calls. (I was a potential customer as well…DUH) Then I called to complain to manager TJ and he left me on hold FOREVER! Called back and he said he was busy. Called the next day and I complained to Anthony, finance manager, that my info had been ran to multiple banks for approval and I never even had a salesman to help me. He apologized and said that wasn’t true and he would personally take care of me. Told him I was dealing with another dealership and would like to compare prices. I said he understood and to come by on Saturday. 

I went by dealership on Saturday at 1:00pm but Anthony was busy. I met salesman Corey and asked if he could show me vehicle while I wait for Anthony. He was very playful, cheery, and telling me he is new from Louisiana. He really sold me on a car for my daughter. After waiting a few hours, I told them I will leave and come back with my daughter. Came back at 5:00pm and they still did not have time. My daughter and I walked the lot looking at cars and I motioned for Corey to come show me car. He shook his head no. When we walked back to the building, I asked why he didn’t come so he could get stock #. He told me he was not walking back out there. By this time I am fuming! I had to ask for my daughter’s key for her trade in car several times. I finally got the keys back and said I was going to other dealership. Said goodbye and Corey just looked at me without saying a word. I looked back in front of everyone and asked why he didn’t even have the common courtesy to say goodbye. He said goodbye with a frown. As I was driving off, Damarcus came out to stop me and gave me numbers for car for my daughter and finance rate. I told him I am going to other dealership to see what they can do, but if I came back, Corey is not to get the sale! He was rude and very unprofessional. I am in sales and would never treat a customer like he did. I am a big stickler about customer service. Damarcus apologized profusely for Corey’s behavior and said he would take care of me if I came back.

Well, after my HORRIBLE experience, Fernando and Benjamin over at Sterling McCall Nissan made everything better! I purchased my daughter a 2013 Versa SL! Top of the line model! The payments are where I needed them to be and everyone over there were so professional. Got top dollar for my trade in too. All the other salesmen congratulated us on my new purchase and shook our hands. It was the most wonderful experience! Baker Jackson Nissan needs their staff to train and learn from Sterling McCall Nissan how to treat customers.

666,"April 08, 2013","When I visited Baker Nissan I was still comparing different cars.  I was honest with Chris and told him that I was not ready to buy.  He did not put any pressure on me.  We talked for a while about the specifics of the cars he thought I might be interested in.  He was honest about the strong points of each car and asked questions about my lifestyle.  At first he thought I might want the Murano but that didn't fit and then he recommended the Maxima, but I wanted a LOT of front leg room and the Altima actually has more room.  We took a test drive in two different models and he was very patient with all of my questions.  When I left I had his card but also there was no commitment that I HAD to call him back or even come back to the dealership  One of the things we discussed during my first visit was the car color and interior finish.I will revisit that topic shortly.

The following day Chris and I had a brief conversation.  It was more of a follow-up call just to find out if I had any further questions.  Still no pressure to commit.  He knew I was visiting other dealerships.   I did visit another dealership but I was very disappointed with their sales pitch and further did not enjoy the test drive.  I called Chris back and told him I would be back on Saturday, two days away.  I reiterated that I wanted a Nissan Altima in Storm Blue with a beige interior.  It turned out that there wasn't as single blue car within a 900 mile radius.  Where did they all go?  Chris called me back and then gave me the choices available.  I wasn't married to blue, but I definitely wanted a beige interior.  In the heat of Houston I did not want a dark interior so charcoal was out, as far as I was concerned.  Chris called me back twice more. He had called around and the only car with the beige interior had a black exterior and I would not even consider that.  Finally, I switched my preference to a Java Metallic and it would be a charcoal interior.  Sigh!  I could handle that  combination because.  Thoughi it might appear that I was concentrating on the superficial,  in my mind, I could do that, because what was most important is that the Nissan Altima was the vehicle that I wanted.  It had the gas mileage, the reliability,and all additional features I wanted. and Baker Nissan would handle my maintenance  Still, I kept poring over the NissanUSA website and convinced myself that I would be fine with the Java Metallic.

Bright and early Saturday morning I arrived at the dealership and Chris was waiting for me.  Once I sat down and we got the pleasantries out of the way, he had this huge smile on his face and told me he had a surprise for me.  He wanted to show me my car.   I walked out the building and in the front of the sales office was the sweetest Altima in a gorgeous bronzish/brownish grey color.  My Java Metallic!  I was so happy BUT when I came closer and looked into the car, the interior was the beige leather.  That was the huge surprise.  I  WAS THRILLED.  I feel in love right at that moment.  It was perfect. That was the surprise.  While Chris was searching for the that exterior/interior combination I wanted and and coming up empty, one of the other dealers got a lead on a car that fit what I wanted but was at another location.  They had arranged to have the car brought in for my arrival that Saturday morning. In my opinion that is service going above and beyond.

I took care of my paperwork, met a few more people who shepherded me through the process of claiming my Java Beauty - aka JB.  I want to also thank Josh Alderete who put in serious phonetime that morning securing a great deal on my insurance.  I would recommend Chris Bennett and Baker Nissan highly.  He is ethical and a wonderful salesman, who seriously cares about his customers.  Getting a car is like marriage.  This marriage Baker Nissan officiated and I am looking forward to a happy, long and loving relationship with JB.

673,"March 29, 2013","Overall, the customer service experience at Baker Nissan was excellent, from every person I came into contact with. However, the price negotiated for the used vehicle was over priced considering the quality of the vehicle and lack of features. Even after offering to put down $4,000  (YES, $4,000 DOLLARS) I still was unable to get a fair price. For a 2005 Nissan Altima, with a cracked windshield, missing parts, lack of features, and other issues, the dealership ended up charging me a total price of over $10,000. Being that it was my first time purchasing a vehicle from a dealership, I didn't realize how bad the deal was until I had already singed all of the paper work.

The in-house finance folks bested the rate I was getting with my bank of thirty years.  John clarified anything that I managed to ask about; I tend to probe and wander at the same time...All in all, it was a pleasant experience.  I will certainly recommend Baker Jackson South - I am a female who enjoyed buying a, new to me anyway, car.

After looking at the Infiniti as well as the Juke, I was presented with an opportunity to buy both at one location.  The service, price and general overall good feeling made it an easy decision to buy both cars from one dealership.

Chris saved me time, money and hassle by putting together a deal for both vehicles which made two of my favorite ladies very happy at home.  At the end of the day, that is what matters.

689,"March 09, 2013","I started on internet and had prompt response from Angel in less than two hours.   He had two cars that met my criteria for me to view upon arriving on the next day.   There was no high pressure sales.   He was aware that I had been to Kelley Blue Book and knew the fair price for the model and after talking to Kenny came back with a price that matched.  I accepted and from there he and John took me through paperwork and had the car prepped in less than 90 minutes.  I appreciated how I was not delayed and given full attention.  Everyone was friendly and liked to joke around a bit.   I enjoyed talking to them.

My only issue was in the prepping.  The Frontier had been sitting under oak trees and the bed was stained by falling acorns and other material.   I had to power wash it after I got it home to fully get it clean.   I also had to come back to the dealership to get a registration paper that was omitted in my packet. 

Angel was adamant about his desire to do whatever it took to make me happy, he gave me a tour of the service area and introduced me to the reps.  He explained the free service and the warranties.

690,"March 09, 2013","This is my second car from Baker dealership.I needed a specific color (wife thing). I researched  the Baker inventory  for the vehicle initally but somehow didnt see the vehicle I wanted so therefore I started researching other dealers and found the dealer with the car. Called the dealer verified they had the vehicle, advertising a good deal. Got there made sure I was going to talk with the person who can deliver my needs. As we farted around walking the lot looking for the vehicle, negative results. After about 45 minutes the maintenance guy confessed that he did a dealer trade last Monday so no go Mo. (hopefully he will be retrained to take things out of inventory). I asked to do a dealer search with leadway but needed the color. Vehicle located thought we agreed to the negotiated price, got into finance reviewing things, things not right, so once again no go Mo. So I tapped into my Ipod and played the Nancy Sinatra song ""These Boots Are Made For Walking"" which I did in my Nike's. Had to go in my covert mode to find where the vehicle was and SCOREEEEEEE. Called Baker North gave him the stock number not there but is at the South store which he gave me a contact number who was Paul Morgan. The person  at the North location said he would call Paul and let him know I was coming and the vehicle would be at the front for me to look at.  Spot on with that handoff. Was met by Paul and the process began. Paul crunched the numbers and was helped with the paperwork by Chris Bennett to expedite things.Chris was very personable and dealt with this grumpy old man very well.  Never seen that teamwork in my many transactions before. Now Ray (sales manager) comes into the picture to review the final figures with me to make sure things are squared with me and that indeed this is what I want. Spot on again. A lot the of the paperwork that was completed I normally dont review untill finance. Bam Boom Pow in and out of finance with final signatures, thanks James Thomas, plus we determined the meaning of Life. Get with James on our answer. Bottom line that was team work at its best. Not going to name the dealership who I left however lets do my 4th grade math. If an old man leaves a dealership at a certain tme and travels at 55 mph and arrives at another dealership in 15 minutes later how far apart would  these dealerships be from each other? But with that said the sales manager dropped that ball. Not at Baker South. Great Job hope that teamwork continues for us consumers.

691,"March 08, 2013","My husband and I were looking to get a safe reliable vehicle. We really liked Nissan so I went online and made an inquiry for a Nissan Versa. Chris Bennet was the first to reply to my inquiry and gave me a call to come by and see him.  We were expecting to get a used vehicle with high mileage because of our credit history. Not at this dealership! Chris Bennet put us in a brand new 2013 Nissan Versa! The approval process was easy because we got approved through Nissan. Beth Northern even worked with me on extending my warranty from 5 years to the 6 years we had the loan for. Everyone was so wonderful there. There customer service is the best I have come across too. I would recommend this dealership to my family and friends not only because they worked hard to get us in the vehicle we wanted, but because the quality of service there is awesome.

692,"March 07, 2013","I wanted a Nissan Pathfinder 2013 in Mocha Stone color - Platinum Premium since October of 2012. After Nissan released the information, that 2013 Pathfinder was going to be in the market, however the truth was far from it. Steve Dean is the General Manager of Baker Nissan South and he said he was working on getting it. Every 10-15 days he would call and say ""Well, Nissan is still not sending the car because there are some issues BUT I am on your side and I will make sure you get it!"" Now we are talking about four and half months delay. Any other customer would have given up - but Steve assured and said that he will somehow make it. Guess what he finally got THE CAR I WANTED in THE COLOR I WANTED AND WITH THE PLATINUM PREMIUM OPTION!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This man was true to HIS EVERY word and truly made THIS CUSTOMER HAPPY. Plus he gave me a fabulous rate along with the VPP discount that was only eligible for the month that it was available in (October - November 30).

 Any other Dealership would have said "" Ma'am - thank you but No Thank you - we can not honor this VPP because its outdated"" But not STEVE!! He knew how badly I was waiting for this car and how much time I had waited. He said "" I will give you this discount (which was quite an amount as I work for an 'A' listed company ( the top 500 list of Nissan).

His entire team - Kenny Franks and Ashley Reeder ( OTHER TWO FABULOUS EMPLOYEES OF BAKER NISSAN SOUTH bent over backwards to make me happy because of the committment and assurance he had given me.

699,"February 25, 2013","My experience with Baker Nissan South was great!  As a hard working mom of three, I needed to upgrade my current vehicle, a 2012 Nissan Altima, for something more spacious to accommodate growing my family.  I have always loved the Nissan Armada.  It has a great external body design and of course a spacious interior.  I submitted an inquiry about the Armada to Baker Nissan and Chris Bennett contacted me regarding my interest.  I had previously been to two other dealerships and was not able to get financed for my dream vehicle so I had given up hope that any one could ever help me.  When Chris called me I explained my situation to him so I would not waste his time.  He did not let my story of getting denied twice intimidate or persuade him to not help me.  He promised me that he would put me in the vehicle of my choice and to give him a chance.  He kept in contact with me until I finally came to dealership!  I brought my Altima to be appraised and he told me to give him some time to work on getting me into the Armada.  I thought he was not going to be able to help me but boy was I wrong.  The awesome finance team got me financed!!!  The only problem was, I was approved but I did not want the model.  I wanted a model with leather seats versus cloth.  So Chris went to work again and of course was able to get me the one I wanted.  We had been going back and forth communicating for almost three weeks about this vehicle.  During that time I was indecisive about paying a larger car note.  Chris never gave up on me even when I had.  He stayed very professional, encouraging, and friendly from the moment I met him.  I am so glad blessed to have had Chris as my car salesman.  If not, my family would not be enjoying our new 2013 Nissan Aramada.  Thank you Chris Bennett for all your hard work and dedication to making a difference in the lives of the people you serve.  If I could give you a higher rating, I definitely would!

I spoke with the prior salesman several times and he had just shrugged it off as if there was nothing he could or would do and as if he just hoped I went away.  We gave it 3 months to try and get rid of the smoke smell and since my son has asthma and we could not get rid of it went to trade it back for a new truck.  In the end we lost several thousand dollars in the exchange and had I known the first truck was from a smoker we would never had bought it. in addition the salesman for the first truck told me it was perfect and that a tire which was low did not have a problem.  I had to waste my time going back to get that fixed.  In a ddition when I was buying the first truck the first salesman had told me it was warranteed for 36000 miles but it was not since it was more than 3 years old and I ended up getting the extended warranty for more money.

The dealership made contact with me in minutes of my online inquiry.

It took less than 24 hours for them to find the vehicle, arrange for the transfer and have it brought from over 500 miles away on the back of flat bed. No extra miles on the car. 

The negotiations were the easiest part of the deal. Straight off the bat I received a very low price for the car and also a very good offer for my trade. After the paper had printed I was out of the dealership in less than 30 minutes. Full tank of gas, quick and helpful tour of the car and an introduction to the service rep and I was out of there.

765,"December 26, 2012","We were looking for a new car and had already looked at Toyota. That dealership did not give us any discount off the sticker price so we went to Baker South. We had been there looking about a month prior and had worked with the Internet Salesperson, who now was no longer at the dealership, so we were assigned Chris Bennett as our sales person. Chris is warm, friendly, knowledgeable and listens to the customer. He does 
have a charm about him and helped make the experience work for us. After we had driven the car we were ready to settle on the financial package. He helped us get into their credit system and then came back with the offer... he told us we would have just one swing at it, it was just the way he worked, (and the way we preferred as well). The price was very good, he showed us the invoice, which we already knew from the Internet, and then gave us discounts, and with our trade we came away with a deal we all could live with. 
We were given a car to drive over the weekend and when we returned on Monday evening we signed the paperwork visited with Keith Haptonstall, the Service Manger who answered my questions I had after reading the operations manual. We also met Edy Woodard and other staff members. Then we went to visit John Mesa in Finance. He went over the paperwork and while reading it, my wife discovered a large (dollar) error, but he immediately redid the paperwork and we signed the finance forms. He allowed us to go home and think about the extended warranty options overnight and we still had to bring the title to our trade and a check for the down payment. We left with our car that night.
The next day I worked with Beth Northern in Finance. She was very warm, sweet, caring and glad to be helpful with the paperwork part of the transaction . She is the Finance person I would recommend you start with, and finish with. After all the paperwork was completed, we just had to return the following day for our window tinting (at no charge). 
I met with Keith and Edy and they got the car right in, and within an hour later, it was completed. They instructed me not to roll down the windows for at least 48 hours, 72 ours would be better, to allow the tint to adhere to the windows and fully dry before we used the windows.   
 
Our only concerns... 
1) No one took the time with us to show us where all the switches and knobs were, and how to control all the electronic functions. Because I had read the manual cover to cover over the weekend, I had a better than average knowledge of where and what control did what. Our last car was 12 years old, and had very simple audio, climate control, and driving systems. This car is all new, with the latest of everything and I think a review of the systems would be beneficial for all new customers before they drive off the lot. It would make them safer too, not too distracted from driving, trying to turn on the windshield washers and not know how...
2) Read all the financial paperwork before you sign it. People can make mistakes and it could cost you much more than you originally thought, if not caught.
 
It was a real pleasure to buy a new vehicle at Baker South. We love the ALTIMA, and we were generally surprised how easy and pleasant the experience was. What a difference the last 12 years have had on the way dealership treat customers and the Internet has helped educate the consumer.  ",5.0

When I told  him what I was looking for in a car he found several new and used options for me to test drive.

Additionally, a finance manager by the name of James Thomas (a gentleman who introduced himself as 'JT') was very helpful with the loan process. Related, my father taught me that a man with two first names should not typically be trusted (a bit of humor, there). James Thomas (aka 'JT') is an exception to that rule; as he was exceptionally forthcoming with me about the loan process.

I have been driving the same vehicle for the past fifteen years and
suddenly found myself needing to make a purchase.  Too many dealers 
to choose from in our city, so I hit the “Internet”.  Every make of car
imaginable.  Put in your zip code,  phone,  email address and shop.
A variety of responses to my web searches and then the phone call from Chris Bennett inviting me to come to Baker Nissan to let them help me through this major decision was all I needed.  A warm reception by a variety of people. Thank you to those who retrieved the keys from the  locked rental.  Chris was patient, listened, asked the right questions to help me decide on a couple models. He and Kenny spoke with me about lease or purchase,  I did a test drive  and on to another appointment.
The follow-up call was the best.  Chris  found the model, the color, the
accessories in a vehicle I liked,  had it moved to their location and would

Also, they got the color I wanted by moving a vehicle down from their sister dealership that day.  I got exactly the color and trim I was looking for.  I do have to point out that I went to this dealer's lot a couple times a few months back looking at Pathfinders, X-Terras and Armadas.  One guy I dealt with did not seem that interested - perhaps I did not seem serious - and the next one a few weeks later was very friendly but not that knowledgable about the vehicles.

810,"September 26, 2012","I pre-ordered my Nissan Altima 2.5 SL w/ Tech Package on-line May 6, 2012.  I then sought the dealership that I wanted to the order and sale with.  I previously purchased a 2008 Altima from Kenney Franks, Internet Director @ Baker Nissan North and was very pleased with both Kenney and the dealership.  I contacted Baker Nissan North which is only ten minutes from my house and learned that Kenney Franks was now working at their south.  I chose to make the forty minute drive to Baker Nissan South to complete my order so that I could deal with Kenney.  When I met with him he immediately recognized me and we visited and then completed my order.  At that time he introduced me to Mr. Benson Peters, who would work with me along with Kenney on the order and sale process.  As expected and advised, the order took longer than I was hoping but I was always reassurred and kept abreast on the progress.  Benson and Kenney were always available when I called to answer my questions.  

When the car came in they contacted and advised me.  We met when I needed and completed the process.  The car was made ready for delivery and ready to go as I expected.  Benson gave me a tour of the service dept. and scheduled my first service.  He also set my blue tooth to pare with my I-phone and saw that the vehicle was set-up and ready to go.

I can't say when I might be in the market for another vehicle, but you can bet if Nissan is selling it I will be checking back with Kenney Franks and/or Benson Peters at Baker Nissan.  In the meantime, I will refer anyone in the market to them.

One year had past since then, and I received an offer from Baker Nissan South to trade in my vehicle for a new one. I was hesistant to come in because I had spoke with Tom Peacock Nissan a week prior and they were not offering me anywhere near a fair price for my car. But when speaking to Godwin, he assured me that he would make my experience pleasureable and get me in a vehicle with a fair trade in price. He kept assuring me that he would find a vehicle for me, and he did just that. I was able to get a Altima 4D Sedan which is what I was looking for (because I am now have two children to drive around), and at a fair trade in price. He made me feel comfortable the whole time, and was very respectful to me. In addition the finance team was able to get me a lower financing rate than I had with my previous loan for the 2010 Altima Coupe. They had both definitely looked out for my best interest, and I will be sure to come back to do more business. ",5.0
813,"September 17, 2012","Before I decided to buy a new car from Chris Bennett at Baker Nissan South, I had already conducted my research and called around to many Nissan dealerships in the Houston area. My interactions at those dealerships prove to be horrible, time consuming, and frustrating. I was a new car buyer, and I wanted something reliable but also within my price range. But most of all, I did not want to be pressured or constrained into purchasing a car I did not want. 

My bad luck changed when Chris Bennett was recommended to me. From the very beginning of our interaction, Chris was not only professional, but he was also helpful and most of all honest! I told Chris what type of car I wanted and my price range, and he was able to help me instantly. Seriously—there was none of the hedging or other craziness that I had experienced at other dealerships.

Chris never pressured me or encouraged me to buy something outside of my budget. I felt that Chris respected me, and most of all, he helped me throughout the entire process (car insurance, financing, etc.), something that was invaluable to me as a first time car purchaser.

Lastly, Crista, a finance manger, was also amazing! She was so efficient, and helped me pick the best warranty for my needs and budget. All in all, she was wonderful. 
Of course, I will be purchasing my next car at Baker Nissan South, and my friends will be too.

This review is for Chris Bennett and Josh Aldrete, who made this, purchase a good experience.  We were in the market for a larger vehicle and were very unsure as to what would work for our growing family.  With such a broad selection, this decision was going to be tough.

This brings a personal level of stress that is added to the stress we feel from the Dealerships and sales personal.

We walked in and were greeted again by several salesmen by the front lobby it seemed assuming that it was since there were tables and sofas near the door. It seemed very busy and everyone was talking to either each other or to customers around. We went to the front desk and asked if they could page Chris Bennet for us. We waited and waited nobody seemed to come ask again if Chris has came by. We waited for maybe 15 almost 20 minutes until I just went ahead and called his cell phone. No one picked up. I was very anxious being that this was my first time here and first time meeting him so I didnt see him around. Finally I heard a familiar voice and approached him and told him who we were. He was very apologetic about the wait. He didnt know that he was paged and he said he was out for a test drive. We understood being that it was the first week that the pre orders for the Altima arrived. I was excited to see my car. We he came to get us for the test drive, it was amazing!!! When we came back, we checked out the car and details while Chris gave us time to do so. He checked back with us showing us the features of the car and how to use certain buttons on key and in car. He then left us again so we could have time in the car. Finally he came to get us and asked if we were ready to look at payment options and fill out some paper work. We came back to the office and got started, told us more about car, and answered any questions I had in mind. When the financing started, it was the longest wait since they were down an associate and computers were slow. We waited for a couple hours. I think we were the 2nd to the last group to go. Financing took the longest since we were going back and forth with the interest rate since my dad was co-signing, he wasnt satisfied with the overall rate in the beginning.

1. The dealer placed ALL cars in the VPP program. In some other dealerships only least popular configurations were placed in the program.

2. Chris took great time to show and explain all the features and options available. He answers all our questions. There was no pressure to sign deal immediately. Overall very comfortable experience.

3. When we indicated (during our second visit) which car we would like to buy there was no pressure to purchase dealer installed options. We purchased car with only manufactured installed options and EXACT configuration that we wanted. I have seen several online discussions where VPP members complained about pressure to buy cars with dealer installed options that they did not want.

847,"July 14, 2012","I researched and internet shopped for a week, I had most of the numbers pre negotiated with Billy before stepping into the deailership (besides trade in value and financing rates).  The numbers matched up to everything Billy had told me via e mail, and the car had everything that I was told it had (plus a little more, tinted windows, lighting underneath, etc...).  That being said, I was very content with the price of the vehicle, because it seems $1,000 or more below what I was able to get from any other dealership for a new Altima with all of these packages.

I wasn't as prepared for the Trade In Value, of which the initial offer was $1,000, which was laughable.  However, I did ask for a $2,500 offer and they came back with $2,300, so I'm content with that, but had I been more prepared feel as though I could have gotten a couple hundred more from that vehicle.

Financing was very easy, the rate was very fair from the start and we didn't get a whole lot of hassle in buying the extended warranties and service plans (which we turned down).

From a buyer like me, we want minimal hassle and re negotiation.  I did all my searching and negotiating via internet so that I didn't have to get pressure at a dealership without having my numbers ready.  Low hassle, very quick process is how we wanted it and I feel that is how we got it.

852,"July 06, 2012","I had a very bad experience my first time buying a certified pre-owned 2008 Altima from this dealership. I purchased it in Noverber 2011. In late February 2012, I started hearing noises from the back of the car. To make a long story short, the deemed that the noise was coming from the rear right shock. The car sat there for about 1 week before they had even ordered any parts to start the process. I became upset after speaking with the over the phone and being laden with excuses, went up there and spoke with the service manager. They finally fixed it, yet roughly one week later, the rear left shock started the same noise. I had to take it back to them and they fixed it. The car was fine until around May 2012 when it started making a squeaking noise. I took it to them about two weeks ago. My service advisor, Rolando, tried to dissuade me from leaving the car there citing that it would be &quot;too time consuming&quot; to find out the issue. The mechanic supposedly said drove the car to hear the squeaking for himself and initially claimed that he heard nothing. Then after taking a ride with me service advisor, he heard it. Unfortunately for me, they called me and told me that since the noise was not consistent, then they could not determine where it was coming from. I was left to drive aroung in a car that I has only have for several months that was squeaking and could not be discovered by the dealership. I felt that this was another excuse of theirs and a way to simply shirk from responsibility. Anyhow, I conveyed my dissappointment to the service supervisor once again and questioned him about possibly getting into another car, preferably a new one. I had put down $5k on that one and asked him what would happened to that if I were to look into a new car. He told me that I did not lose my $5k. So roughly one week later, I went to seek out a brand new Altima since I though that my $5k down payment would apply considering my situation. Needless to say, it was a totally different story when I spoke to sales. My down payment was indeed lost. On top of that, they showed me the car facts of the 2008 Altima that I bought from them only in November, and it was a totally different report than I was shown at the time of purchase. Rather than 2 previous owners prior to me, it reported 3. It also reflected that the car has been in an accident in 10-2008 (which brought my issues with the car into perspective). I told them that I was shown a totally different car facts report in November which definitely did not reflect that the car had been involved in an accident. I am for sure it mentioned nothing about an accident I would have never even touched that car. Well, my sales rep, Julie, told me that the car should have never even been sold to me. As a matter of fact, she said that it should have never even been on their lot. I was gravely dissappointed at the findings. Once I found out that the car was previouslt wrecked at has so many previous owners in such a short duration, I wanted out of it and done with it for good. I did get a brand new Altima Coupe, but I found the entire previous car buying experience very unsettling. The told me that the car was sold to me under previous the previous reprehensible management. That only made me feel worse as I felt duped, conned, decieved, and flat out robbed. So here I am starting all over with a $29,000 car and I had no money to put dowm. I still feel as if something should be done about the &quot;previous management's&quot; shoddy salesmanship. Something should be done to set this wrong that I has sustained right. I will be taking my experience to Nissan corporation. I had an overall terrible experience with this dealer although they did throw in a bluetooth phone system at no charge. But that does not even come close to redress to me. To tell you the truth, I do not ever want to return to this dealerdhip and it is a mere four miles from my home. Thus, when I need a simple oil change, you better believe that I will be making the trip to whereever another Nissan dealer is located. I am saddened. I do have 1-2 good things to add, my 2nd sales person, since Julie had moved to another department after the sale, Billy Bui went over and beyond to see that I was happy with my new purchase. He made several calls to the bluetooth installer in order to get my sytem functioning properly (since they failed to leave any type of instruction manual in the vehicle). Also, Alex in finance also saw to it that I was properly accommodate with my new vehicle. But all in all, it would have been better if the first car had worked out.          ",2.8
853,"July 06, 2012","I was researching and looking for a new car on the internet for four weeks. I visited several car manufacturers web sites and requested price quotes from them including four Nissan dealers. As I received offers I started visiting the dealerships show rooms and every time I get the same run around that I do not qualify for this rebate or that rebate in addition of the very low price for my trade-in. When I went to Baker Nissan, Billy was waiting for me and he showed me the car he quoted me in his e-mail. When we got back to his office I told him how I was so frustrated by all the other dealers because they will not honor the price they quoted me and the low trade-in value for my car. Billy was very understanding and asked me what do I expect from him. I told him exactly what price I expect for the new car and the trade-in value for my car. He immediately went to his manager and made sure I get what I wanted. I got the car for the price quoted with no change and I got the value for my trade-in. In one hour he had all the paper work ready and took me to the finance office to finalize the deal. Uriel Ayala, the finance manager, got my information and started working on getting me the best deal he can, and sure I got a deal I was not expecting. All this happened in three hours, from 7 - 10 p.m. Billy and Uriel were so considerate and professional all the time and it did not bother them that they were still there after closing hours. Billy even took the time to go over the car with me before I left the dealership. This was the best car buying experience I ever had. There was no pressure from any one and I got the car I wanted. I will recommend Baker Nissan to any of my family and friend",5.0
854,"July 03, 2012","I had such a great experience working with Godwin at Baker Nissan South!  I came in looking to buy a certified pre-owned 2011 Nissan Altima.  Godwin showed me the cars available on the lot but I was looking for some specific options on the car and there was nothing on the lot that met those specifications.  Godwin brought me back to his office and explained how I could get the factory options installed in the car that I wanted at a VERY reasonable price!

I came in on a Friday afternoon and drove off with my new car AND the installed options by Wednesday!  Such a great car buying experience and I would recommend this dealership and Godwin to any of my friends or family looking to buy a car.

I purchased a 2012 Altima 2.5 SL from Mr. Jackson on 6/15/2012. He is a no-nonsense salesman, gets right down to business, and found the EXACT Altima I wanted (color, interior & amenities) prior to me ever having to go into the dealership. I had never driven a Nissan, much less an Altima, and I bought my Altima over the phone with Ed because I TRUST him. This Altima is the 9th vehicle I have purchased over the years, and I WILL deal with Ed Jackson again. I DO RECOMMEND Ed for ANY vehicle sales.

**Even though I had the choice of using two Nissan dealerships extremely close to my home and work, I chose to purchase from Ed Jackon at Baker Nissan South because he does what he says he is going to do, backed up with an excellent deal and SUPERIOR Customer Service.

863,"June 15, 2012","It took 3 hours to accomplish a cash deal where there was no negotiation about which vehicle I intended to purchase or the price of the vehicle.  Unacceptable.  After all the paperwork was signed I was handed one key to the vehicle.  There was no remote and no disclosure that there was no remote either on the internet description of the vehicle features or during the sales process.  When I complained about this they did agree to reimburse me for the cost of the remote - however, that meant more time off work to make a trip to a Ford dealer to purchase and program a remote for the vehicle.  This did not feel like good customer service to me.  The Ford dealership was more accomodating over my $52.00 remote purchase than Baker Nissan South was over my $18,000.00 purchase.  Baker Nissan's failure to disclose the lack of a remote or to just send an employee to obtain a remote before listing the vehicle for sale seems very short-sighted about how a small thing can sour an experience for a customer.

864,"June 11, 2012","I inquired online about Nissan Rogue pricing and received a return email from Benson Peters.  I had requested not to be contacted via telephone and also expressed I was in no hurry and just in the inquiry stage of my 'search'.

Benson was very respectful about not calling me and provided great customer care within the parameters requested by me.  It was because of this and the only reason I decided to drive out to the dealer and meet Benson and 'just check-out' the vehicle(s).  He was not pushy and I didn't feel his supervisor was on his back about getting me in or bothering me. I will go the other way if I'm getting too many phone calls or if I feel I am not being heard and a sale is needed. 

Benson was patient and kind.  He listened to me.  I had no intention of purchasing a vehicle at this time; yet I bought one anyway and the main reason was not the car, it was Benson.  Don't get me wrong, if the pricing had not been right, it wouldn't have happened; but it was Benson that made the difference.  When you factor in Benson and the pricing, it was a match.

Jeff Cole was very personable and gave me the impression he cared more about me, my  needs and goals than making sure Benson (Baker Nissan) made the sale.  These are qualities I will continue to work with in the future and provide referrals.

I am very strong and strong-willed and have no problem walking away and being completely blunt if someone is pushy and I'm not comfortable.  Benson and Jeff will continue to have my business and that of my family and friends.  I have extra business cards in my new vehicle just for that purpose.

Thank you for a pleasant car-buying experience.

Baker Nissan South did not have the exact vehicle we were looking for, Electric Blue, but he said he would find one and call me back.  Within an hour he had already located the vehicle at another dealership and had it transferred so we could buy it from him at the quoted price. He took time to explain all of the features of the Juke and how to use them before my daughter drove the car off the lot. 

Uriel Ayala gave us a very good deal on the extended bumper to bumper 100,000 mile Nissan warranty and the 5 year 75,000 prepaid maintenance, as well.  All in all, we had an outstanding car buying experience with this dealership.

The sales guy carried through with what he said he would, such as-- having a moble bodyman repair a dent in the quarter pannel the following week.

The dealership owner told me to take it to any other Nissan dealer as Baker Nissan South can not fix the problem. ( Matt Baker).

The reason for the  loewest rating possible is because this is an inherant problem the dealership knew about and latently did not tell me about the challenges with the Nissan Murano.  Buyer Beware...

He acted as if I was his underling and he could boss me around. Jeff obviously is very arrogant and has horrible interpersonal skills. He thnks that he can force customers to buy on HIS terms.

907,"March 14, 2012","The reason I'm rating it as such it's because of Amy; she was very friendly, not pushy like other sales people, if she didn't know the answer to one of my questions she would get it for me. I think the reason I bought the Juke is because she wasn't aggresive and try to ""sell"" me B.S. like other people do. 

I also came into contact with a gentleman named Kurt, he actually sat me (and Amy) down and went over the manual and other stuff over the car; which I have never experienced in my experience buying cars (5 cars). I wish I had more time for him to go over more points on the manual (and other quick tips) but my time was constrained. 

Over at finance, I was helped by Tim Dickerson. He described and explained what every paper was for NOT just ""sign here, and here, here"".

I hope that if I ever go back there, which I will for maintenance of my Juke from now on, I don't come into contact with somebody that will ruin my GOOD experience over at Baker Nissan - South.",4.8

912,"March 03, 2012","Chris had been in the trench for me fighting to get me the loan I needed for almost 3 weeks. I got a low payment and a decent apr even though I'm a single father that got massacred by my ex credit wise. I went to several dealers till I met Chris and then I got coaxed to go elsewhere where the customer service was just not up to par at Sterling McCall. Chris was there to take my feedback and make sure I was real comfortable in a vehicle that met my requirements. Chris had my back constantly and even gave me his personal cell so I could ask him info at any point during the interaction we had. He sets the bar beyond any customer service and salesperson combo that I have ever encountered. Chris might come across as a busy man but that's because the word of mouth sales he generates are outstanding. His excellent skills in communication will make you regret walking away from this man and going with anyone else. He closes deals all day long and he's all about sending you home with a smile on your face. If someone else tries to lead you astray do not leave this dedicated man. His co workers appear frustrated because he's always closing deals. I let his manager know about the good work he was doing. I think Chris needs his own errand and retention employee on the house. Chris has a leg injury but he'll run to service his customers and you can see the pain. But hes always got a smile that lets you know that he wants to do big things for you. His customers always know they are in good hands. If someone else tries to lead you astray do not leave this dedicated man. Even if you do, he'll still come back to try and save you from yourself. Just do it. He's quick and effective along with amazing quality assurance traits you'll love. I love a straight talker. Chris did for me and I'm going to see all my Nissan business his way. The ability to be versatile with any client is just the beginning of the observations you'll make of this man that he's working for you.Thank you Chris Bennett! Even got my car detailed and filled up on the way out. He let me try the car out for a couple of days to make sure I had met up with the car for me. Chris maintains a professional conversation or you can just be yourself. Either way Chris gives you the impression he should have his own dealership. Normally I wouldn't care about service from a company. But Chris just made everything perfect. He even tuned my radio to popular stations. I've been in customer service for over 10 years and he knew how to approach me. Give that man a raise by bringing more business to him. He's about quanity over 1 shot bend them over the barrel deals.

So I went in Saturday around 6 pm. and Mr. Browne came down to show us the car. He came out saw the car took the stock number said let me go get the keys. Came back said we can't start the car because there is a problem with it so we are going to have to service it but let me see if I can find the keys and we can at least open it and see it inside. Well, of course he could not find the keys so we were unable to see the car. We asked what happen to the car, can we get more info on the car -nothing. He knew NOTHING!!! We drove all they way there (from Kingwood) and when we left got stuck in awful traffic (there was an event at reliant and the dealership is close to it.)  I didn't get to see the car I wanted and let me add that we had the cash ready to buy. I emailed back Monday to see when the car would be ready for us to go test drive and they told me they sold it Saturday night (after we had been there and couldn't find the keys.)

He talks fast and sounds like he is from Louisiana but he is actually from Texas! :) I liked him right off the bat. I was very defensive since this was the first place I looked for a car. Before I even saw the car I thought I wanted I had already met his manager and General Manager. They are all very nice and I love the fact that Baker Nissan is family owned. They all made me feel very welcome and my kids loved Chris because he bought them smoothies from the smoothie truck! :)  We finally went to test drive my car I would buy and I loved it right away!

My husband began corresponding by phone with Chris after weeks of dealing with many other salesmen at numerous dealerships of all kinds. Within that afternoon, Chris had the car of our choice brought to their dealership, and more than ready for us to test drive.  We were given 100% of his attention and he listened to everything we said was important to us.  The financing portion was very swift, yet thorough, and they made sure that the financing options were in our best interest.  After signing, we were given a tour of the service department and introduced to everyone there.  We were on the road with our new, beautiful car within a couple of hours!

Chris Bennett has followed up with any request or concern that we have had since our purchase and we would absolutely recommend him and Baker Nissan South to any of our family members or friends in market for a new car.

928,"February 09, 2012","After having experienced a horrible recent car buying attempt, I was reluctant to even set foot in a dealership, however Chris Bennett assured me that he would minimize the time and effort on my part, if I would give him/Baker Jackson a chance.  I told him exactly what make, model, features, price, etc. I was looking for and what little time I had to spend at the dealership.  Within a day he called me back and had the perfect car available (he had arranged for it to be brought over from another location).  Still reluctant, I asked about the price, terms, etc., however he had a quote already to go within my previous price range and terms.  I agreed to go to the dealership but only with certain time restraints (no half-day marathon car buying session for me!).

True to his word, when I got to the dealership, my new Nissan was sitting out front waiting for me.  I was able to look at the actual vehicle and all its features and start the preliminary financing paperwork all within about 30 minutes.  I then went off to my previously scheduled appointment, while my new car was having its windows tinted and all the paperwork was being drawn up.  

When Chris told me that he could have me in and out of the dealership within 90 minutes, I just knew that couldn’t be.  But when I went back to the dealership after my appointment, my car was ready, I signed all the financing papers, and was on my way in an hour.  Total time of car buying experience = 90 minutes – just like Chris promised.

In that time, I also was personally introduced by Chris to several of the managers – the Fleet Manager, the Service Manager, just about anyone I might need to speak to while owning my vehicle.  Each gave me their business card and assured me that they were available to me for whatever assistance I might need in the future.  

Chris then took the time to review all the features on my vehicle before I drove away - happy!

In summary, Chris did exactly what he promised – minimized the time and effort on my part to make a wonderful car buying experience.  I could not have asked for anything more!

We were greeted by salesman Lawrence Jackson.  Lawrence introduced us to Used Car Sales Manager Jeff Waite.  Jeff showed us a tan Toyota Solara and a royal blue Honda Accord. Jeff and I agreed that the Honda was more practical for my daughter than the Toyota.  My daughter, Lawrence and Godson took the Honda for a test drive.  We really liked the royal blue Honda, so I agree to have my credit report disclosed under the contingent that I would be purchasing that vehicle. Lawrence gave me the necessary paperwork to sign, including the car fax report.  Lawrence insisted that we take the royal blue Honda home that night.  I declined.  I expressed that I would return the following day to drop off the deposit check and to pick up the car so my mechanic could check the car before the final paperwork was signed.  
On Wednesday, January 25th,2012, my daughter, my Godson and I returned to Baker- Nissan South. Lawrence Jackson was not available, so Frederick Penny made himself available.  I expressed to Frederick that we were picking up the car (royal blue Honda) so I could take it to my mechanic for an inspection.  Frederick said it was against policy and that we could not take the vehicle overnight.  I then ask Frederick if Jeff, the sales manager, was available. I also asked Frederick about a burgundy Honda that I saw offered on the Baker-Jackson South web page.  Jeff greeted us with the paperwork that I had signed on Tuesday. In the meantime Frederick drove a gray Honda to the front.  Both my daughter and I were a bit confused because this gray Honda was not the car that she test drove.  Frederick looked at the VIN number on the paperwork. He said, “202222B, that’s the VIN number, see 202222B it’s on your paperwork, look 202222B.” I then said, “To Be or Not To Be, that car parked out front is not the car my daughter test drove. Yes I may have signed all of the paperwork for that gray Honda, but that is not the same car. My daughter test drove a dark blue Honda.” Jeff insisted that the gray car looked blue.  Yep, the ole “Bait and Switch.” My intelligence was insulted.  Jeff continued to insist that this gray Honda was the same car from the night before.  My daughter and I looked at each other in awe!  We could not believe what was happening. Jeff then escorted us on a “wild goose chase” looking for the blue Honda in the lot of used cars. While on the “wild goose chase,” my daughter spotted a Nissan the same color as the first Honda she test drove, she ask my Godson, “What color was the car we rode in last night? Was it this color blue? Or was it this color?” pointing to the second Honda (Gray). My Godson said, “It was blue.”  Jeff explained that in his twenty something years of selling cars, he had never h had anything like this to happen. He then took the keys and went to his office.  I was in shock. I said, “So, that’s it! You don’t have anything else?” He said,” No!”  I asked another salesman where was Jeff’s office   because I was still in shock.  After talking to Jeff Waite for a few minutes, I realized that he was not going to admit that this gray car was not the same car, so we left carless. I didn’t dislike the gray Honda, but it was the principal of the matter.  Don’t insult my intelligence, or my daughters or my six year old Godsons.  I am appalled that Lawrence Jackson and Jeff Waite would allow me to sign paperwork for a vehicle that I had not approved. That is deceptive, deceiving and unacceptable.

949,"January 02, 2012","What a wonderful car buying experience!

After an awful experience at Baker Nisson NORTH, I decided to give Baker Nissan South a try. 

Our salesperson Alfred Garcia was absolutely a joy to work with.  Alfred was attentive without being over bearing, knows his product, listens to his clients wants and needs in a vehicle.  This dealership is top-notch.  I experienced nothing other than complete professionalism throughout my entire experience including the Finance Manager - James Baker.  

After almost deciding to take my busines to Toyota rather than Nissan due to my bad experience at Baker Nissan North, I am so grateful that I gave Baker Nissan South a chance to win my business.  I would recommend this dealership to anyone interested in buying a vehicle, and will definitely be a returning customer.  

Baker Nissan South - You Rock!  

Keep up the good work and best of wishes in 2012! ",5.0
950,"December 30, 2011","I am an educated and conscientious consumer. With that being said I set out to buy a 2008-2009 Nissan Altima 2.5 S. I knew what the cars were worth and I knew what I was going to pay. I started at Clear Lake Nissan and went to every Nissan Dealer from Stafford to Humble. BAKER NISSAN SOUTH was BY FAR the best dealership to work with. I walked into the Dealership frustrated and fed up at 815om 12.30.11. I found CHRIS BENNETT and immediately knew that we had our guy. Very professional and helpful. I told him I was putting a large cash deposit down and told him my out the door price. He ran around, found the car that he thought I would like, and we agreed on the price and signed before 9pm. The next day when we took delivery Chris was very, very busy, but he STILL had the time to treat us right, get our car washed, polished, and shined up nice, and answer all of out questions. 

If you want a strait shooter from a great dealership, go to Baker Nissan South and ask for Chris Bennett, you won't be disappointing! ",5.0

Patient salesman Chris Bennett turned buying a car into a fun, five-star learning opportunity and I am mightily pleased with the transition from Z to cayenne red Rogue. This is a dealership you can count on to be helpful and customer-focused.

Also, the finance team member, James Baker, ensured that we found the best financing and helped us explore all our options.  This kind of customer service is hard to find and is very appreciated.

953,"December 27, 2011","My Husband and I went in just to look at cars, not to buy on 12/22 which was a very cold day. The only salesperson who came out was Keldrick and that impressed me especially after talking with another dealership who scared me just from a phone call. Keldrick was patient understanding but he was truthful and upfront from beginning to- end even coming in ON HIS DAY OFF !!! to get the deal done. 

It is very rare that you meet a car salesman who genuinely cares about the buyer, I found this in Keldrick. Needless to say that my husband and I purchased a new vehicle and will be going back and telling everyone that we come in contact with that we found a jewel of a car salesman who breaks the stereo type and sets the standard very very high for others. Additionally, I found the dealership to be a very pleasant place to purchase. All of the salespeople are sooooo friendly, the receptionist kept making sure that we were informed and o.k.as did the other salespeople. The Manager  talked with us and made sure he did everything that he could as well, to find the best deal for us. The long and short is that we felt that they were trustworthy and that says a lot especially for my husband! 

The finance guy explained everything in such detail that we had zero questions (No bait and switch or fast talk). 

All in all if you are looking for a great buying experience,  BAKER NISSON SOUTH is THE ONLY PLACE for you!

I inquired by email  and got a call telling me that they will call me back after the salesman speaks to the manager and I never got a call back. I Went in person and the sales manager was very condescending when I was speaking to him. They basically turned me away after being told about the types of low credit clients they get In that area. What they didn't know is that I was pre approved for $40K before I went there and had the check with me. After I left I made an offer of a $1000 less than they were asking for on a $36K car and the salesman, J. Martinez, told me that he wanted to buy that car and if they didn't give it to him, that they are not going to give it me! I asked him to check  with his manager and let me know.... he sends me a TEXT MESSAGE! Very perofessional!
In his text message, he basically tells me that his manager said that if I wanted the car I have to pay a price that was $3000 more than they were asking. I would never recommend this dealership to anyone, not even someone I dislike. I guess they must be making a lot of money if they are turning business away. I wonder if that's the policy that the upper management and board of Baker Jackson tells them to abide by.
Not professional at all. Luckily there are plenty of other dealers willing to take my money. 
By the way, I have never written a review of anything before this because I felt that it was a waste of time, however, this experience was so bad I had to share it and hope others won't have to go through this as there are plenty of other options. Apparently the dealership/salesperson thinks that anyone that goes there is not worth their time. ",2.0

My friend recommended Chris Bennett and she was right, he was knowledgeable about his product and I had several questions the other 5 dealerships could not answer.  I knew what I wanted, I knew the price of what I wanted and Chris delivered.  He was extremely attentive, no B.S. (which I truly appreciated), fair and responsive.  I came in late, he stayed with me until I finished signing the bottom line.  Being a female purchasing a vehicle is usually one of the worse experiences.

970,"November 16, 2011","It started early friday morning in route for a routine oil change. I went to clear lake infiniti and put my car into service, while there i wanted to check out my options for trading in my car, the options were not my cup of tea. once i left Infiniti, i called Baker Nissan south and was connected to Jeff, whom i believe is a GM there. Real gentleman. I gave him some options i was looking for and he notified me to come in and he will set me up with his number one guy Chris Bennett. I came in that afternoon after work hours and I met Jeff and Chris. Chris then introduced himself and the dealership to my wife and I and led us to the options i spoke of over the phone. He had the car ready for a test drive, upon return we asked Chris for another color. and to our amazement he had it in stock. My wife and I asked for a little time to decide and Chris gave us that time, then we came inside to make a deal. While getting numbers to an agreeable number, there was never a point that my wife and I ever felt as if our sales person has abandoned us. If Chris assisting a customer that came in knocking at his door, Jeff stepped right in to keep our spirits high. I will say i admire that Chris and Jeff would tag team in a positive way, because if i was that customer knocking on chris's door I would want to feel a priority. Kudos to you two gentleman. Once everything was set, ,we visited Tim in finance, he assisted us with many options and the final number, there was a little difference due to my trade in, and Tims boss, I cant remember his name, stepped up to the plate and was able to pave the way to help completing the sale. Tim then helped up with the paperwork and we were soon complete, Tim also did a great job also. Chris then met us and had our vehicle washed and ready to go. Jeff also met us in the lobby and congratulated us on our new purchase. I approached both with great gratitude of A-class patience and fairness. Something I was lacking at the Infiniti Dealership. Chris then led us out to our new vehicle and assisted us with transferring items from our g35s to our 370z. Now noticing that we closed the dealership we thanked everyone and took pictures of the vehicles before we left. I work in an environment where customer service is prided at being 1st on our list, and it really goes along way in my book when I receive this treatment. I will say to the gentlemen at Baker Nissan South, Thank you for making our experience first class.

They are usually very aggressive, pushy and tell tall tales to persuade me to purchase the car that my heart was not set in.  Things changed for me at Baker Nissan because my first purchase there was by far the best experience I’ve ever had (with a salesman and purchasing a car).  

Both Chris Bennett and Carl Price let me work at my own pace without any pressure of time or commitment.  The first car I picked, Chris gave me a quick overview of I needed to know about the car.  He then gave me the keys and walked away so that I can check out the car at my own pace.  When I asked if I can check out a different car, he never showed me the impression that he was irritated or bothered with me changing my mind.  It was extremely hot at 106 degrees, yet he simply gave me the keys, gave me quick overview of the features and left me with the car.

I was glad I had the chance to check out the options so that I can make the purchase that my mind was set on.  I told him what I wanted and that was when they both worked with me on price.  At the end, Carl handed me the keys and gave me a thorough overview of all the features of the car.  I was at awe with his knowledge and patience.  

Both Chris and Carl were great to work with.  They teamed up and gave me the best deal that I can ask for.  They were honest, thorough, and very far from being pushy.  I walked away without any buyer’s remorse.  I was so pleased with my experienced that I came back 3 days later to purchase a truck for my husband.  That deal was even better.   Now we are both happy with our purchases.

Thanks Chris and Carl for all you’ve done for me and my family.  VOOM, VOOM!

1008,"August 27, 2011","Horrible experience!! Had everything done before we even got to the lot including financing, or so we thought. We made sure we were approved, found the vehicle we wanted and made sure it was at the South dealership so we could look at it when we got there. We were assured the vehicle was on the lot and ready to go when we got there. The vehicle we were trying to finance was not there when we arrived and we were told it was sent to auction because it did not pass inspection. Why would they even put a vehicle online to sell if it won't pass inspection?? 
The website is apparently never updated, so the salespeople have no idea what they have on the lot. When we stayed to find a replacement vehicle to purchase, the only ones they said we in our price range were disgusting, had no a/c or they were tiny and only one was even close to the price we originally were looking for. 
The salesmen tried, but there was NO organization to the lot, the website couldn't help and the manager kept sending them after vehicles we didn't even want to look at! We were on a very limited time schedule and tried to make sure everything on our end was done to expidite the sale, but unfortunately after several hours of sitting and waiting for them to find a comparable vehicle, we were out of time and left. I doubt very seriously I will go back and would not recommend this dealership to anyone I know!!",1.5
1009,"August 26, 2011","This is the second time for me to buy a new car at Baker Nissan South. The first time, the experience was very enjoyable and I came home with a brand new car for my wife. We are very happy with the selection. This time around, the sales people were very helpful and courteous. They were able to offer me a deal that I could not refuse. I had three other dealerships that offered me excellent deals. But, Baker Nissan outdid them all. I am very pleased for the help that Paul Hopkins, GSM and Suzette Nguyen were able to provide. Especially, I was very pleased with the work Chris Bennett did to help me reach a deal. I greatly appreciate all they did and will recommend anyone to this dealership. My wife and I love our car and wish everyone would own a Nissan.",5.0
1010,"August 22, 2011","My husband and I saw Baker Nissan South across the highway from the Honda Dealership and decided to come and see what they had to offer. We were met by a salesman (Carl Price).  He was super nice to deal with and was honest in answering my questions.  We found a SUV that we liked very much and decided to end our search by purchasing this vehicle.  The year on the windshield of the vehicle was listed as 2011 but in their database and according to the VIN, the car was actually a 2010.  They also had the wrong color for this vehicle listed in their database.  Carl Price had to leave work and left us with another salesman who was not helpful.  The sales manager, while negotiating a purchase price for the car, told us that he could not come down $1000 on the price because it was a demo car.  The car was not a demo, but rather a pre-owned vehicle.  Together the sales manager and the salesman promised us that they would fix the small chip on the bumper.  We explained that we lived out of state and that we would need it to be done before Sunday (the day we would be heading back home) and they said that was fine.  We did a joint credit check because we were doing a joint car loan and financing with Nissan. They offered us a low interest rate of 1.99%.  They drew up the contract and had me sign some parts of the contract and I asked where was my husband supposed to sign?  They didn’t remember it was a joint car loan even though they ran both of our credits.  That contract was discarded and a new one was printed out and both of us signed this one.   I asked for a payment mailing address and Suzette and Al Garza told us that it would come in the mail.  Upon finishing up the contract, we asked when they would have our vehicle body work complete and they gave us a deer in the headlights look.  Apparently their body shop only works during the weekdays, but we came to a decision that we would get the body work done at a Nissan dealership near our house and that Nissan Baker would pay them.  Leaving that dealership that evening, both my husband and I felt very unsettled.  We were concerned that there were so many problems with the car purchase but after some thinking we thought that there would be no more problems since the contract was completed.  WRONG!!!!  I had problems getting the dealership to call the dealership near my home to arrange payment for the bodywork.  After a few times of calling each dealership to figure out the communication issue, they did finally communicate and the paint chip was fixed.   A few weeks later, I was beginning to wonder where notification was as to where our first payment was to be sent.  A few days later, I (not my husband) received notification that the financing for my loan was not accepted.  I was quite concerned about why the financing for this loan was not accepted and was wondering why this only had my name and not both of our names on it.  I called the dealership and was told that my financing was declined temporarily because they accidentally pushed the first incorrect contract through. They also mentioned that the second contract that we signed was also invalid because it needed an arbitration agreement (which was standard among contracts).  Once a third contract and arbitration was signed, the financing would be accepted.  They asked us when we would be coming in to sign the contracts, to which we replied we can’t.  We don’t live in the state and this is not our mistake.  They told us that our contract was not valid until this was signed and that they would overnight a new contract to us.  In return for signing a release in full (arbitration agreement), they would make our first payment for us. The finance manager told us that it would be in the mail shortly and asked us for our mailing address.  It was not sent until over a week later and was sent to the wrong address.  After some time, the car dealership does do what they promised, by paying our first payment.  We ended up getting a payment address and were able to pay our second and third payments.  The Nissan Motor Acceptance Corporation (NMAC) website which allows you to keep up with your billing statements and payments still does not show that we have paid anything even though they cashed our checks on August 8th.  I call and check on this last week and they said that it should update with 72 hours of payment processing.   It is August 22nd and it still shows no update.  I also ask about where our license plates and registration are and NMAC says they can’t tell me because the dealership has not even sent over the title to the vehicle.  They told me that I needed to call the dealership and look into this problem.  We purchased this vehicle in May and we still do not have a license plate and/or registration.  I call the dealership, get a voicemail, clearly leave my name and number twice and ask for a call back to which no one calls me back.  I do not feel that buying a car should be this much trouble.  I love my Nissan, but I will never buy another Nissan again.  This stress this dealership has caused me far outweighs my love for my car.  Please think twice about buying from this dealership and if you do, DO NOT FINANCE with Nissan.  Go somewhere else for financing . . .  the finance department at this dealership is INCOMPENTENT.  Save yourself many headaches.  ",1.4

There was no pressure from the sales person, Chris Bennett, and everyone else wanted my experience to be the best and the financial advisor, Al Garza, wanted to get me the best deal possible!  I walked away with the exact car I wanted for a great price and with everyone wishing me well.  I could not have asked for more from a car dealership.

1019,"August 08, 2011","Well folks me and my sons went to Baker South last week for a deal on a 2011 Altima for lease. As soon as we walked in we were greeted by one of their finest sales person Chris Bannett. One of the very first thing he did which really impressed us was that he went and got his General Sales Manager and Service Manager just to meet us and make us feel comfortable and feel home. That really proved us that this is a family operated business because they want their customers to know who they are dealing with when they walk inside the doors of Baker Nissan South. Then Chris asked us what deals we were looking for and after finding out all our requirements he started working on a quote and offered us. But of course there's always a room for a bargain which we did and we finally came to a comfortable price which we both agreed on and honestly speaking i dont think anyone could've beat that deal! Then as the process went through and we met more of their staff and finally their finance manager which was also a great pleasure and most importantly we saw the owner, Baker, walking around the showroom. I guess he was doing that to keep a eye on all of his staff whether or not if his customers are being treated good or not. That explains how great this company is because when the owner is personally involved in the business, customers feel more comfortable and also know that the owner will not let their sales person do anything which will loose the customer. 

I would like to first thank Baker Nissan South for the great service and ofcourse for the wonderful deal they gave me. And last but not the least i would like to thank Mr. Chris Bennett for his great effort and making one more customer  HAPPY n SATISFIED! I think if it wasn't for Chris and his first impression, we would've probably walked back out that door. 

I would highly recommend Baker Nissan South to anyone and everyone who is looking for a GREAT DEAL on nissan and if u do go there i highly recommend that you talk to CHRIS BENNETT for an awesome deal! ",5.0
1020,"August 02, 2011","I was an easy sale -I went in to buy a car and had to get it done that week due to end of financial year and upcoming travel. From the first moment Chris was very straightforward to deal with -he loves his job, dealing with clients and getting the deal done. He also enjoys having a real relationship with the client and has a sense of humor about the job -important to me

He had to get the actual car brought in from another dealer but made it happen without any grief or concern for me. 

Great dealership and lead contact made this a very enjoyable experience. I would recommend Baker Nissan South if you are shopping for a new Nissan",5.0
1021,"August 01, 2011","I never imagine that the car buying experience could go so smoothly and quickly. Chris was very knowledgeable, helpful and made the experience an overjoy. He provided additional services that I didn't know to request myself and I spent a total of less than 4 hours at the dealership for the entire process. I was provided with all the information I would need in order to ensure that any and all of my concerns would be taken care of without delay. I would recommend Baker Jackson South to everyone looking to buy a Nissan in the Houston area. ",5.0
1022,"July 31, 2011",I contacted the dealership on-line and was given a firm price at that time.  The salesman Jeff Cole found the car I wanted at their other (North)location and had it trucked over to the one near where I live.  He acilitated the sale exactly as we hoped for.,5.0
1023,"July 28, 2011","I did sufficient research prior to stopping by Baker Nissan South of Houston so the dealer didn't have too much work in convincing me to buy a car.  Prior to visiting the dealership I went back and forth with Lawrence via email discussing price.  I received a great quote at another location which Lawrence did not initially beat, but came very close so I decided to come in for a visit. 
Lawrence is not your stereo-typical car salesman (aggressive, pushy, etc) or maybe he already knew that I was going to buy so no pushing was required.  Either way, it was refreshing to not have to deal with the sales pitch.  Lawrence showed me a vehicle that happened to be the exact configuration/color I wanted so we moved back to discussing price.  The negotiations were minimal and painless and after agreeing to a price, I was brought to the financing guy. 
This is the ONLY negative part of my experience with Baker Nissan. In my excitement in buying a new car I overlooked that I calculated my budget using both a rebate and a low interest offer special that Nissan had at the time. As some may know you can only utilize one or the other.  In discovering my mistake I notified that I can't buy the car since I made the mistake in calculating cost, payments, etc. and would have to come back after I look things over. Well, instead of offering to assist me in my calculations or kindly guide me any other way, this guy accused me of knowingly trying to play dumb in order to get both the incentives. He kept repeating &amp;quot;c'mon you know that you cant' use both, it's one or the other&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;you've bought cars before, you came in here and know this&amp;quot;. Trust me, I felt silly enough that I overlooked such an obvious thing, so this guy didn't help. I left. I wish I had a name to provide the readers so you can avoid this particular guy. He was hispanic and I believe his office was the last one on the left down the hall to the left of main entrance of the dealership.
A few days later, Lawrence gave me a call to see if I gave anymore thought about buying the car. We worked out another deal on the phone and I came in the next day.  This time I dealt with another financing advisor, Suzette. It was night and day compared to the other guy as Suzette was as professional and personable.  She was friendly but got right to the point. In addition, she gave me a rate that was 1.2% less than the other guy offered me.  This kind of threw me off, but this resulted in significant savings so it didn't matter that I got different rates. 
In the end, I drove out in my new car a happy man.  I am extremely happy with my experience with everyone there with the exception of that one guy which is why I couldn't give a perfect score for overall experience. Either way, I would recommend this place.
Update: I had to go back and give slightly lower scores for ""price"" and ""customer service"" for the following reasons. Price: Although I felt that I had a pretty good price in the end, not 10 days later, a signidficantly better rebate was available. I understand that this is not the dealers fault and timing is important in buying a car so take this for what it is. I marked down service because roughly 2 weeks into driving my new car I received a warning light which turned out to be low washer fluid. After contacting Baker I was not asked to come it so they can fix the problem. This is not a big issue but I expected more from Nissan.",4.0

He was also very clear in communicating the company's warranty program...more so than the other three dealerships I visited. Though extremely busy, he made himself available whenever I called the dealership and made me feel at ease purchasing my used car.

1073,"April 19, 2011","I went to Baker Jackson to purchase a car I knew exactly what i wanted and how much I was going to be able to spend. A salesman named Ross greeted me and showed me a few choices of the vehicles I wanted.
We talked for a minute i explained my situation and even told him what my credit scores looked like. No problem he said we went inside to start the process, he then involved another salesman named Shelby they both gathered my information. They then asked me to hang on for a few minutes and then came back, asked me a few more questions and left again. They then asked if I was intreasted in purchaseing a new car and I told them I wouldnt mind if it was in my price range they then showed me 3 cars that were in my price range and lucky for them one of them was the exact make and model that i wanted. 
    So to make a long story short I arrived at 6pm on a Sat. waited for the finance manager to work on my deal I waited and waited and waited. Ross then walks by me and says oh let me go check on your deal.
He comes back and says he is still working on it the banks are slow on Sat. he states and disappears. Shelby meanwhile is dealing with another customer and only notices me when he see's me walking to my vehicle to leave. He then says wait i'm going to go check on your deal looks for Ross and then goes back to the other customer. Finally Ross comes back and says oh its to late we will have to call you on Monday after we get you a deal. It was after 8pm and I was very upset that they had me standing there just to tell me we will call you Monday. Monday rolls around and i have to call the dealership a total of 7 times to get a hold of one of the two salesmen when i finally speak to one of them he informs me that they can not get me financed for the car that i want and they would be able to get me financed for a less cheaper and inexpensive model. By now I am already unhappy and wanted to see what the next excuse was so i said to him ok lets shoot for something less expensive I selected another vehicle and he said we will get to work on it and I will call you back. Four hours later and still no call back so I call back and ask for Shelby oh he says Ross didn't call you well we could not get you into that car neither maybe a pre owned vehicle also do you think you can put more money down..........Wow now would you refer these guys to someone?

The car I wanted was at the North store and it took longer than expected to be transfered. After inspecting it we determined that it had some problems and Shane promised he would fix them. He fixed all the concerns on the car during and after the sale. 

The bad side of all this was it took from 9:30 am until 7:30pm to complete the deal and drive the car home. Mainly because every time a negative issue came up, Shane wanted to make sure it was addressed and resloved that day. 

I will say that in the end, Shane Williams proved to be a man of his word. This is an attribute that is not prominent in used car salespeople as a general rule. I can honestly say this because I had a terrible experience at the North store and Shane did everything he could possibly do to make it right.
Anyway, in the end, my wife and I are very satisfied with him and will definately recommend him to our family and friends.

The price could have been about $500 lower, in my opinion.

1102,"January 06, 2011","My dealings with Baker Nissan South was very poor.  I would not recommend them to anyone.  It started with Chris Bennet e-mailing me a price for a new 2011 Nissan Rogue (with quick response).  He told me over the phone he had me approved for a new Roque within my monthly payment range ($450) with putting $2,000 down.  I also received an additional e-mail from Jose Molina offering an additional $500 off, a free window tint, and 1 year free maintenance (unlimited mileage).  When I showed up for my appointment the next day Chris was not there, so I was given to Shelby (who was very helpful)  After taking a test drive and picking out a vehicle, I gave copies of the e-mails I had received with the pricing/discounts to Shelby.  Shelby came back from financing with a price that was $3800 higher than what was e-mailed and higher than the monthly price I was told was available.  I had just wasted over 2 hours of mine, my wife's, and Shelby's time.  After a little haggling we agreed on a price, because I was in a bind.  Our company had taken away our company vehicles and said we needed to get our own by the end of the year. I was going out of town the next day, so I had to make a deal.  Then to top it off, I had to drive back 45 minutes, later in the day because they had put the wrong vin on the paperwork.  I love the vehicle so far, but am very leary of the dealer standing behind what they say they will do.  Don't believe what you are told up front.",1.0

I was able to ride with Mo to pick up my car from the other Baker Jackson location.  Mo took time to tell me about the car and explain the features Chris and I hadn't spoken about or I had forgotten to ask.   Good job Chris and Mo!

I was pleased with the price I paid for the car.  It seemed fair.

I was pre-approved through my credit union so I was a little surprised that finance wanted to run my credit when I told them I was not finanncing through them.

I was told I had to complete the credit application in order to purchase the car.  You only need to fill out a credit application if you are asking for credit. 

I was disappointed that I was told I had to complete the application to title the car. NOT true...you don't have to complete a credit application to title a car.

Overall, I am pleased with my purchase.  I think I am gonna love my new car.

They are kind and friendly in a professional matter. 
So far, so good. My 3 month old Versa was flooded with water. When I contacted Baker Nissan where I bought the car, they told me to schedule an appointment in a few days when they had time and that since it had rained in the past week, they would not cover it because it must be flood damage. After reviewing them on the internet, I decided to try Baker Nissan South because they had much better reviews. They still wanted me to schedule an appointment for the next day, but I explained the situation.
They took my car in on an extremely busy Saturday and gained enough ground to allow me to leave comfortably in just a couple hours time. I went out and talked with the mechanic myself and he was extremely friendly and down to earth: I need to pull your whole car apart to find out what the problem is. I watched him carefully take out some parts as I collected my personal things.  I am fine with waiting because they gave me a very nice rental. I need to pay the tax on the rental, but that is somewhat understandable, as they do not know what the problem is yet.
The service coordinator, Rolando, was as busy as a symphony director. He made the hustle and bustle as pleasant as possible.
Receiving the rental car from one of the most beautiful women I have ever met, having her sit down in the car with me and explain how everything works, had me leaving with a huge smile!! She just had some good vibes.  So did Rolando.  I hope they can fix it soon... And that they cover it fully under warranty!  I have no Idea why they wouldn't...  I will keep everyone updated.",5.0

It was a great experiance for me to get the used vehicle deal from the Baker Nissan south, Specifically since I am new in the United states and don't know anything here.

I had searched lot of dealers and private owners for the car but I got the best deal from Baker Nissan South.

Great Sales team and customer support peoples.

Only I would like to mention that after sales procedures and deal it takes too much time for completion of documentation.

Also I would like the sales peoples to improve the communication about the vehicle condition ( In case of Used one )to give the exact techinical status for buyer during the deal to make the right decision but still I appritiate the overall team performance.

Also I noticed that Baker nissan south list lot of vehicles on the craigslist but they do not publish the vehicle information ( Like Photo, Milage etc. ) on the website , so it will be better if they publish the detailed info. on the web for the buyer to make the decision. 

But obviously as I experianced used vehicles does not stands still in Baker Nissan store since all must be getting sold immidieately due to great sevice and sales team performance so I would withdraw this suggestion.

Keep it up , You people are doing the excellent job.

After my initial round of shopping for a new car, I was deciding between an Nissan and a Honda and in simple words the reason why I bought a Nissan was because of Jorge Lopez. Our negotiations were straight and the Sales managers Jose and John were very helpful with the price

The best part was the financing dept, being a first time buyer it was a challenge for them to finance my purchase for a competitive APR, without any negative comments they processed my deal successfully and helped me with my purchase.

Since it took me some time deciding on my choice, I spent a lot of time visiting the dealership looking for answers. Every time I went, my buddy Jorge was there to welcome me with a smile and he never felt annoyed and he helped like a brother. I felt the dealership was like a family, because even after post purchase, I had people call me and check on my new car and even received thank you cards which really surprised me. From day 1 which when I decided on the car till the end I drove the car out, Jorge was there with me and he never let me loose and we check on with each other as we become good friends. All my requirements including pricing, color, additional features everything was taken car off in the most professional way.

I am definitely thrilled and happy with my purchase from a very nice place and I would recommend my buddy Jorge Lopez. ",5.0
1155,"September 29, 2010",Chris was a great salesman.  I came in and found what I wanted and was able to get it for the price range I was looking for. His manager John was also pleasant.

1156,"September 29, 2010","Before buying a large purchase, I do a significant amount of research and I ended up at Baker Jackson South.  Even though I passed two other Nissan dealerships while driving to see Carl Baker, it was well worth the little drive.  Carl saved me $2000 more than 9 other Nissan Dealers I shopped.  Carl Baker and his sales manager was awesome!  ",5.0

Dont stop what you all are doing .    ,5.0

We had some minor communication problems at first but that was soon rectified and to make a long story short, Mr. Thomas and the staff at Baker Nissan were very professional and courteous even when faced with adversity (my wife), she is a loan officer. We drove off in our new Armada Titanium and we are loving the vehicle. We thank Mr. Garcia, Mr. Thomas and especially Chelvis (manager).

1159,"September 15, 2010","We recently purchased a Nissan Frontier LE.  Our initial vehicle search was done online with requests sent out to 4 dealers in the Houston area.  Although Baker Nissan was one of the lowest bids, we opted to visit two other dealers prior.  The first dealership we visited basically told us they only had one truck left on the lot with the LE package but the color was wrong.  They appeared to have NO interest in looking for another in the area and allowed us to leave the dealership.  The second place we visited was the classic slick high pressure dealership.  The quoted price they provided over the internet did NOT include a bunch of bogus after market addons.  The internet representative quickly handed us off to a regular high pressure floor salesman who kept trying to explain how the internet price did not include this or that.  By the time we contacted Baker Nissan, we had learned that there were not any trucks left in the Houston Market with the color and options we desired.  Our salesman, Shelby Allen, asked for a chance to look outside the region to see if he could obtain a truck we would be happy with.  Amazingly, he was able to locate a truck with all the options we requested.  When finally sitting down to work the numbers I was shocked to find that the numbers he quoted over the internet were truly the final numbers.. no haggling, no pressure.  A few issues arose after the sale, but I must commend Shelby for taking a positive role in getting everything resolved in a very calm and professional manner.  A very refreshing experience when buying a car!!",5.0
1160,"September 14, 2010",awesome customer service. everyone there was very friendly and helpful. I knew exactly what I wanted when I went in and Jerry went out of his way to make sure I got the car I wanted. Jose was great at working the numbers to make sure I got the best deal possible.,4.6

1163,"September 07, 2010",I would like to thank all the people involved in helping my wife and I on purchasing our 2008 Chrysler Sebring convertable. Shane was very helpful on promising that he would help us get the most out of our trade and also get a good price on the vehicle we purchased. We had driven about 80 miles to the dealership and due to Shane had returned the next day to bring our trade and close the deal. It was also nice that the vehicle was washed and the fuel tank was filled befor we left the dealership. Thank You again.,4.2
1164,"August 30, 2010",I really did not expect to drive out with a vehicle. I have been shopping around looking for various vehicles from diffrent dealers and I was being told the same thing that I needed at least $2000 down payment or a co-signer. Well my sales man (Iggy)was very convincing he got me in the doors. When I showed up I figured he was going to tell me the same thing. When I sat down in his office first question was what color car. Well I was rude and said first tell me if you can get me into one! He was very sweet and put up with my husbands comments. My husband kept saying tell her what happens after that; on every question. So I got the basics and he said can you put down a down payment I said no. Then it sounded convincing and I said $500 well we went to try out the car and thats were it got me. We went inside and started signing papers. Turns out I did not need to give anything down and no co-signer. This is my fist car and I am proud to say I am buying it from Baker Nissan South. Thank you for this wonderful experiance and life memory! I will definetly return; with more people.,5.0

1170,"August 19, 2010","Chris was overall a great salesperson. He was always very straightforward with me over the phone, and was forthcoming on what he was and was not able to do. He happily beat a written offer from a competing dealership and kept true to his word. Overall I was very satisified with my vehicle. I am somewhat disheartned with the fact that my brand new Maxima which only had 8 miles on it when purchased had alignment issues on the drive home. A brand new car should not have a crooked steering wheel and should not pull to the right on the highways. I am hoping the dealership can address and fix this issue ASAP.",5.0
1171,"August 18, 2010","Prior to the purchase of my Murano, I have been an Acura owner for 20 years+.  I knew I wanted an SUV and researched Acura, Honda, VW, Toyata, Kia and Nissan to make my decision.  It came down to either Acura or Nissan.  My decision to purchase the Nissan Murano SL was based upon several factors.  I think the most important factor was my salesman.  Chris Bennett went the extra mile to find exactly what I was looking for and went to another dealership to pick up the SUV and have it at Baker South within hours.  Upon meeting him and test driving the car, he was very knowledgeable, friendly and introduced me to all the features about the Nissan and the Baker Nissan South dealership (Family).  He even added a year of oil changes for my car.  Prior visits with other dealerships did not provide that type of interaction and service. 

The Murano SL is a luxurious, value-packaged, safe vehicle that I will enjoy for many years.  I added the extended warranty plan to my car and having met Edy, in service, and Kurt, in finance, as well as Baker South management, I will be certain to share this pleasant and accomodating experience with others.",5.0

1175,"August 11, 2010","The purchasing process is ok. But there're some problems about the after sales service. Everything of this car was fine but a small crack of side mirror when we're buying this car which is August 4th . So the sales man promised us it would be fixed after that day. Two days after which is August 6th, we're there taking our car home, we found some parts were MISSING, including a piece of cover on outside mirror, and a piece of door handle cover on driver's side. We feel terrible about these. If we can not trust the works of these small parts, how can we trust the works of other important parts?
And unfortunately, the shop was closed when we're taking car. So the sales told us he can get the parts the next day and fix it within 5 minutes (and it proved that the sales knows nothing about this part).
To avoid driving 2 hours back to College Station, where we live, and to save the fuel cost, we stayed at Houston for a night.
We, again, were there to fix those parts on August 7th. And waited about 2 hours. Then the employee of service drive department, Roy, said we have to wait 5 or more days until they get the complete parts but not a piece of mirror and door handle covers.
That means we waste 1 day at Houston and lots of fuel between College Station and Houston (even more, we might have to go back there AGAIN for the complete parts). What is even worse, the driver side door handle is out of order now (it falls out from the door).
We ever thought about cash back or other way to cancel this deal, but we don’t want to do this. Because we do need a car and looking for another one is a big work.
At first, we were happy about buying a car and thought we can recommend Baker Nissan Houston to our friends who coming to Texas and need cars .
But now we just want those parts to be ready and the door to be fixed as soon as possible.

1181,"July 29, 2010",This was my first new vehicle purchase and I was extremely amazed with the Benson and Jose at Baker Nissan South. I had been to and dealt with at least three other Nissan dealerships in the Houston area and was very disappointed and frustrated. I had began negotiating with Benson over the phone and by email and was able to meet with him afterwards. I liked that the person I initially spoke to on the phone was the person that I would be dealing with regarding the sale. At other dealers this was not the case. I felt like Benson and Jose both went above and beyond to work with me on the amount I wanted to send on a car and stuck by their word. It is not very often that you can seal a deal with just a handshake and feel secure that they will keep their word. This was truly a great experience and I thank them for their courtesies.  ,5.0

He also picked me up at the hotel with the vehicle and we had a nice chat on the way to the dealer. 

Despite the wait at the finance department (one hour that I didnt like), I found Jerry to be a good broker and someone who genuinely wanted my family to have a good deal. Because of him, we went to Baker Nissan (40 miles away from us) when we could have walked to Champion Nissan here in Katy.

1188,"July 21, 2010","Very honest and friendly people. I had been back and forth with my local nissan dealership and they were being very deceptive and unreasonable with me. I went to Baker Nissan's website and requested the truck I had been searching for and told them how much I wanted to pay. They offered me a deal no one else came close to if I came in that night to purchase it. Due to my work schedule, I had already committed to other things so there was no doubt I could come in on short notice. I called the dealership and spoke with a salesman who told me they would honor the quote if I came in my next available day. Baker Nissan is about a half hour drive from where i live so i was a bit unsure about makeing the drive due to my most recent expirence with my local nissan dealership. But as soon as I drive into the parking lot,the sales associate i spoke to over the phone was waiting for me outside and had the truck pulled up ready for me to test drive. Afterwards, the process was very easy. They gave me the exact quote i asked for. No one tried hassling the agreed price which was very nice because I had already shamed one too many car salesman through out this exprience. One thing i will comment on that was very frustrating was the wait and time. The associates were always coming and going with information, so we would have to wait a good half hour for one thing to get accomplished. I think i spent 5 hours at the dealership. Which i didnt complain about at the time because they were being as reasonable as could be, which is mostly what i cared about. 5 hours of my life is nothing compared to the truck i get to have for the next 5+ years.

1190,"April 30, 2009","This place is a joke, and I would never go there again nor would I recommend it to my worst enemy.

I did all my research on the car I was interested in buying and knew exactly what I wanted.  All I needed was to test drive and see the car in person.  I have a two-year old Mustang GT to trade that's in immaculate condition with extremely low mileage and could easily be sold by a a dealership for $23k+. 

Having said all that, the salesman we got was not only a rookie but he shouldn't be selling cars.  When I asked him simple questions about the car, such as where on the window sticker I could find the name of the color of the car, he couldn't tell me.  So not only could he not tell me the color (Graphite Metallic) he couldn't tell me where on the sticker I could find the name of the car.  I also inquired about a piece of equipment in the back of the vehicle, and he couldn't tell me what it was either (Cargo Cover).  I told him I wanted to test drive a car with Navigation, but he kept insisting a particular car had Navigation when it clearly did not have Navigation.  He ran off to get the keys to the vehicle I didn't even want to drive, and my husband and I were left to find one with Navigation on our own.  When he finally came back with the keys to the other car, he got annoyed that we once again told him we didn't want to test drive that car and, in fact, found one we did want to drive.  We went for a test drive and I wanted to enter the dealership's address in the Navigation System to test it out on the way back, and he didn't even know the address of the dealership!

Long story short, the man knew absolutely nothing about this car.  He pressured us repeatedly to pick a car based on color alone and kept us waiting in his office so long (on numerous occasions) that we finally decided to leave.  When he came back with an offer it was so ridiculous (MSRP for the new car and offered $8,000 less than what my Mustang is worth for a trade) that I told him we were beyond done and wanted our keys to leave.  Then they wouldn't give us our keys back after we asked three times and kept asking us to stay 5 more minutes.  When I was about to make a scene they finally gave us our keys back and asked us to stay 5 more minutes AGAIN and even followed us to our car.

1191,"November 06, 2007","I visited Baker Jackson's south location on loop 610 to have work done on my Maxima.  The ignition key cylinder was jamming up and needed replacement.  I ordered one from another dealer and installed it myself in my driveway in 15 minutes with household hand tools.  The problem was that  this car uses an immobilizer that requires the new keys to be programmed to the car.  I called this dealer and asked the fee for key programming and was quoted $70 for 2 keys.  My plan was to tape my old key near the immobilizer sensor and drive it over with the new cylinder installed to get in and out for $70.

Unfortunately for me the car would not start with this trick so I had to reinstall the old key cylinder and drive it to the dealership.  Anthony met me on the service drive and wrote up the work order.  This occured on a Saturday and the place was busy with people coming in for oil changes.  He told me they would try to get it done before 1 pm when the service depratment closed as I left the car at 9 am.  A few hours later he called and quoted me $280 with a labor rate of $95 per hour.   I did not have time to keep the car down so I went ahead and did it since no one but a Nissan dealer can program the keys.  

Anthony was very professional and friendly; his service was outstanding.  However, the dealer ripped me off in labor charges.  I am not a mechanic by profession and what took me 15 minutes to do at home in my driveway they billed me for over 2 hours of labor in a shop manned by professional mechanics.  If I had the time it would have been cheaper to had installed the cylinder in the car myself and then tow the car to the dealer for programming.  

I would not recommend this dealer because of the outragious price for service.  However, if you can not avoid them ask for Anthony in service and you will be treated well.",3.8
