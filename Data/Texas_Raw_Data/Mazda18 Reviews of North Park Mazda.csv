2,"December 16, 2019","My husband and I are very disappointed in the service and overall treatment given to us by the staff at North Park Mazda - San Antonio, with specific regards to the extreme pressure and haggling tactics that were thrusted upon us during the buying process.  We were FORCED (and I do mean FORCED) to purchase an extra ""Protection Paint Package"" that we had NOT agreed upon when we negotiated the price.  According to our salesman Gary, the GSM- Jeff Akeroyd, would not agree to the purchase price we had already agreed upon with Naomi Ortiz and John at the dealership.  In order for them to sell us the vehicle we wanted, we would have to purchase this extra protection package.  We went back and forth for some time stating how we did not want to purchase this package and were told the only way we could purchase the vehicle was to also purchase the package. You do have the option of just not purchasing the vehicle from this dealership- this is true, however after an extremely long day of test driving vehicles from different dealerships and not being from San Antonio, we were extremely tired from the long day and needed a vehicle for our daughter.  I must note that we will never buy or recommend purchasing a vehicle from North Park Mazda- San Antonio, as we did not expect to be treated with such disregard when we had already and specifically come to a mutual agreement on price.  We expected better service and treatment from this dealership and from their staff.  It's unfortunate that North Park Mazda does not live up to their own commitment to excellence with regards to their customers as they state on their website!",1.0
3,"August 01, 2019","We just picked up our FOURTH North Park Mazda car (Cx5 ) ! We keep coming back because we love everything about this dealership. The dealership itself is clean and attractive and  everyone (including the owner, Mr.  Khalig ) is friendly and always available  to answer any questions or offer assistance .  Our  Salesman (Richard Cortes) has always gone above and beyond, and bends over backwards to make sure that we walk  out of there with the car ( and the deal) that we want. AND lets face it once you drive it off the lot-it's the SERVICE that counts, and their service dept. is the BEST we've ever experienced ( and we've lived all over the U.S. and Europe!) From the Service Receptionist Kaala   to the service manager Robert Castro we always get the feeling that we are in good hands and are ALWAYS treated with courtesy and respect. This is an honest review, we have no personal affiliations with anyone at this dealership , we are from Boston Massachusetts and arrived here in Texas 5 years ago from The England.  I just wanted to let everyone know  about our wonderful experiences at North Park Mazda.

5,"August 28, 2018","My Mom (70+) needed a new car & I can't thank Richard Cortez enough for taking such good care of her.  Richard and I did all of the communication by phone & email.  He gave us a good price and took the extra time to make the entire experience less stressful for my mom.  In the past, the process of purchasing a new car has been overwhelming & stressful for her.  
I was not able to go with her to pick up the car, so her and her best friend made the trip (from Austin to San Antonio), while I was at work.  I told my mom, if anything was different from what we agreed upon, she was to walk out the door.  I also communicated to Richard that my mom understood all the terms we agreed upon, but that she sometimes needs a little extra time to process all of the other information.  I asked him to plan a little extra time and to slow the sale down so it would be less stressful for her.
My mom walked out of North Park Mazda with a new CX5.  She had nothing but nice things about Richard and the entire staff.  It was well worth the trip to San Antonio for the quality of service.  
Thank you Richard for taking the extra time!  I truly appreciate it, Lisa ",5.0
6,"March 11, 2017","The salesman, Michael Anderson, worked to get me the vehicle I wanted, at the payment I wanted. He was very helpful and knowledgeable of the vehicle.  The North Park staff was friendly and attentive from the time I drove up to the dealership to the time I left. Best buying experience ever!!",5.0

8,"January 13, 2017",y husband took his mazda in today to have the dealership take a look at an issue we have had with our brakes. The dealership returned the vehicle to him with hand tightened lug nuts. It is a 3 hour drive back home. Thankfully he made it home and caught the issue before his 11 hour drive back to new Mexico on monday. The dealership only offered him a $100 credit on his next visit back. This mistake could've left my husband seriously injured.,2.0
9,"May 05, 2016",customer service was great. They were patient and cooperative with all of our questions. Daniel was fun and family oriented and provided lots of information for what we were looking for.  Thank you.,5.0

11,"September 20, 2014","We are repeat customers at the North Park Family of Dealerships and had yet another great experience with North Park Mazda .Scott Brothers ,the Operations Manager made us feel like royalty, as did our Salesman , a very nice young man named Justin Pope. They worked with us until we got the exact color, features etc. we wanted. The owner Kristy Davis- Kahlig the Dealership owner was also Very gracious and kind. The Bottom line is we are just ordinary people who got treated as if we were special- come to think of it, if All Dealerships treated people this way. it would be a happier world! Can't wait to go back in a few years for another car! ",5.0
12,"March 13, 2014",Outstanding service as a repeat customer through USAA car buying services. Level of professionalism and customer service was high. AJ Ortiz was an excellent representative of the dealership and Mazda brand. The integrity and quality care I've consistently received here brought me back today; my positive experience working with AJ will bring me back the next time.,5.0
13,"March 13, 2014","I would recommend north park Mazda to everyone I know. They went out of their way to make me happy as a customer and put me something into I could afford. AJ Ortiz and David Cruz were phenomenal, very professional and were down to earth which was very comforting. I went to other dealerships and didn't compare to north park Mazda. In the future I would definitely go back. I'm satisfied all around",5.0
14,"September 25, 2013","I was a repeat customer, and they treated me ok, both times, however, my sole purpose in buying the car that I went there to purchase was to purchase the last year in this body style of car I was looking at.  This particular vehicle was supposed to change its body style in 2014 and from everything I researched and everything I learned from talking to people that was to be the case.  So, I wanted the last year of the body style.  I talked to my salesman before that, and he agreed that they were supposed to change with the 2014's.  I went down there and they gave me an excellent trade in price for my vehicle, and made me a great deal as far as price goes on another.  One of my saleman's co-workers was talking to me while my salesman was doing something business wise for someone else, and we discussed this last year body style thing, and as it turns out, he said no the new body style was not coming out till 2015.  My guy got back, and he said no they are coming out in 2014's.  Well, he got me on a technicality, because he would say he was not dishonest about the new body style coming out in 2014, because that is when the 2015's will come out..... in late 2014.  I was just mistaken and did not stop to think about that.  That was my fault, but since I know he as well as all of the others there knew it, he could have corrected me and explained where I was going wrong.  Instead he didn't, and the new 2014's are out on the dealership lots, and guess what?  they look just like my 2013 !  hmmmm.  Well, I feel stupid for not thinking this thing through better myself, but I can say that I do not believe a one of those men there were being honest when they sold me this car and did not stop me.  Yes, the mistake was mine all the way, but it was theirs too, because it showed me that they are not honest and did whatever they could to sell me a car, and the reason was probably due to the fact that they needed to hurry up and get them moved off the lot, so they would not have to pay taxes on them come the end of the year and to make room for their elaborate 2014's of the same body style !  Never again will I buy from them and I now see how they treat people and probably laugh at them all the way to the bank to deposit the customer's money.",3.4

16,"January 13, 2013","Watch out for bait and switch. Price was quoted over eMail, reneged in person, much higher price demanded.  I won't be going there again.",2.0
17,"October 14, 2010","BEWARE dealing with this dealership and it's service department. When my accelerator on my Tribute stuck on the highway (very serious problem and terrifying experience), I was told to bring the car in to be checked out by the dealer. North Park Mazda not only charged me over $100 to tell me what was wrong, they refused to accept responsibility for their faulty machinery or repair it. When I attempted to have my vehicle towed off their property after paying the fee, the tow-truck driver found that they had mis-placed my car and none of the employees knew where it was. I had to arrange and pay for another tow the following day. When I tried to talk to Tony in the service department about it, I was argued with, yelled at and hung up on, twice. This story may sound extreme, but it did happen. Please proceed with caution. I am completely disappointed with my experience there.",1.0
