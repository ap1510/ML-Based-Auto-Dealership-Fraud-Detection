22,"November 14, 2019","The showroom was very nice. Separate to that, I was especially disappointed for the way it turned out. Your address was misleading and to top that off you also wanted several thousand dollars down too? I was specifically told you had a bunch of cars not even requiring ANY down payment for my income bracket So very disappointing to this retired lady.

The journey even had place broke on the passenger seat.  I flooded during Imelda and it‚Äôs been a struggle to find something decent and Hyundai of silsbee did not help me at all.

41,"September 24, 2019","We visited Hyundai of Silsbee a couple months ago, to get an idea of what Hyundai had to offer. We knew that our current car was going to have to be replaced and that we wanted a Hyundai due to their outstanding warranty. Mikki Williams helped us during that visit. She was absolutely AWESOME! She was very helpful, showing us options to consider when we were ready to make a purchase. Despite the fact that we were not ready to purchase a new Hyundai at the time, she was very helpful and patient with us. She answered all of our questions and was never in a rush. Well a couple days ago, we were ready to see about getting a new vehicle. When we got to the dealer, we knew that we wanted Mikki to help us. Once again, she was great!!! Having a limited budget, she worked with us to find a vehicle that would fit our needs and desired monthly payment amount. She was very honest and sincere about helping us to purchase a new vehicle. No pressure at all. Her only goal was to help us replace our twenty two year old car. With Mikki's help, communicating our desires to Robert Bridle (the finance manager), Robert was able to get us an the car we wanted, within the monthly payment we desired. We left there feeling blessed. Rather than merely wanting to sell us a car, we felt that they genuinely wanted to help us to be able to get a new vehicle. We would highly recommend Hyundai of Silsbee. Like I wrote in the title, it was the best car buying experience We've ever encountered. If you are looking for a new vehicle, with an industry leading warranty, go see Mikki Williams at Hyundai of Silsbee!!! ",5.0

70,"July 07, 2019",Hyundai of Silsbee had the xxxxest service ever at a dealership. I took time out of my day after THEY sought out me personally for my truck just to waste 3 hours and not get what they had said they would get for it with it basically being brand new. Then when promised another deal they ended up backing out and like I said wasting basically my whole day. I have dealt with several different dealerships and this has been far the worst. The new owner should be a shame. The previous owner Tony was great and actually took the time to take care of his customers. Will never be going back there. ,1.6

89,"April 16, 2019","When I walked in the employees were definitely friendly & even smiled upon greeting. I worked w/ Lindsey which I believe it seemed to be new in this area or at this dealership. The manager that worked w/ her was Keith Brown. Mr. Brown was not at all what I expected w/ all the friendly employees, he was not easy to get talk with. Instead of the customer expressing their concerns & what they would like, he continued to speak over me. He would ask a question & if you did not respond ""YES or NO"" he would interrupt you by saying ""it's a YES or NO question"". Well I believe that he could have a little more friendlier. I was not pleased w/ him at all. & the way he spoke to the sales rep, Lindsey, I felt was even more rude. I felt so bad and embarrassed for her. You should not treat your employees or your customers as such. Unfortunately, I walked away w/ no resolution or vehicle. Which I don't believe that it was their fault of me walking away w/o a vehicle it was just that I was not able to afford what they were offering. All in All the major disappointment was customer service. Unless I was working w/ someone else I would not want to go back.   ",1.6

92,"April 09, 2019",Our salesman was Korri and manager was Elvis. Pleasant to work with.   Only thing the dealership can work on is making sure the online cash price is what is quoted to customer when they come in. It was somewhat misleading. ,5.0
93,"March 24, 2019","My husband and I have been in the market for a new small SUV since having our son. I was back and forth on the phone with a salesman from Hyundai of Silsbee. He called me to tell me we got the green check from the bank and could head on over to look at and sign paper work on the car that I wanted. Keep in mind my husband and I live all the way in Lake Charles so it‚Äôs about an hour drive with a 6 month old. When we got there our salesman had two other customers so we literally felt like we were sitting and waiting most of the time.. after test driving my vehicle they low balled me an amount that was below the KBB value. They then informed me that my notes would be way higher than what my husband and I told them we could pay monthly. Since they messed up when running our credit and didn‚Äôt check the dates on my husbands pay stubs he said we wouldn‚Äôt be in a vehicle today anyways and that he would take a look at it in the morning and give us a call. THE WORST PART, I show him my coupon for the $100 Visa for stopping in and he says he will take care of it.. I NEVER SAW IT AND EVEN AFFER REMINDING HIM OVER TEXT HE STILL IGNORED IT. The next day I texted over and over about any new details on the vehicle. No one responded. After they did respond, they wanted more money down and on a car we werent even interested in. After wasting our gas and time driving all that way, we left empty handed. No car. No gift card. Poor service. I have contacted the dealership via Facebook about the gift card and service and still no response. ",1.2
94,"March 21, 2019",Our salesperson was R. Simon. She was clueless about the sweepstakes and that was the main reason we came in. There was problems when I requested to speak with the managers. I asked for Paul he was off. Asked for Keith he was busy. Asked about Dale she never really gave an answer.  Walked away came back said she didn't know where Dale was. We're not sure if we're closing a deal or not. Never had to wait this long to purchase or not purchase a vehicle.  She said she would call tomorrow if deal goes through.  Confused customers....

The only problem that I incurred was that I completed an online form to get a free Visa card if I took a ""Test Drive"" and I did not receive it.  I have sent Korri a text and have not gotten a response.  I also talked to him about it the 1st day that I was in there.....  I know that it was very late when I finally got to finance and it was probably overlooked... Could someone please help me with this??????",5.0
120,"November 12, 2018","This dealership was unprofessional compared to other dealerships. Employees were all in sweat pants. One even had profanity on his shirt. They went on to explain several times that it was casual day. To me that means jeans and a nice polo. Not track suits that are falling off and workout leggings for women. If you are having to explain your wardrobe over and over it probably means that you shouldn't be wearing it. First impressions do count and the experience felt cheap and inappropriate. 

During the negotiations process we would agree on a number only for him to go back to his manager and come back with a much higher number. He made it seem like the number we agreed on was going to be good, but in reality he had no say in price. 

He also would keep showing us the money he would be loosing on the car. I'm sure this tactic does work for some people, but for us we cared about what we were going to be spending not how much he was loosing. 

There was also a hidden fee of 2,000 for a mandatory security system that we did not want. If not for that we maybe would have been able to work out a deal, but they were not forthcoming about the cost of this security system in the listed price and that felt wrong to me. He did say this was listed in an addendum online, but I'm not going to go hunting for hidden feature costs on the car. If there is a feature on the car that is mandatory, it should be in the list price or be optional. You wouldn't list a price and then in negotiations say oh yeah also there is a mandatory 2,000 fee for the leather seats that are already in the car. 

So all in all not a great experience. ",3.0

1. Music in showroom is to loud they were playing R&B at a loud level it was difficult hearing what the salesperson was saying and I noticed the receptionist was having to repeat herself on the phone. 

2. Making a customer wait to long to view the vehicle... I made an appointment and still had to wait nearly 25 minutes before I could actually look at the vehicle to much information is requested up front before you can even see a vehicle.

3. Salespersons need more training on product knowledge, perhaps the salesperson was new when I asked what the fuel mileage was of a vehicle I was looking at the person replied ""I Dont Know"" but probably gets good mileage.

214,"October 11, 2017","Everything was good, I just hated that I didn't get the internet price of $13,400 as listed. It was explained to me that because I was not Military, a flood victim etc, the incentives did not apply to me. I missed reading the fine print. I also didn't like that the APEX was added into the price and not an option to decline, because where I live and attend school no one steals Hyundai's so, the GPS in such an affordable car is pointless. I  paid cash but missed getting my St Luke's employee benefit incentive discounts at Silsbee Hyundai. I am a college student and my mom didn't understand that the internet price was just to make the pricing look boldly attractive. All in all I Got some incentives and forced to pay for Apex GPS. Bottom line I know not to ever believe what I see advertised at dealerships without investigating the prices first. I went $1600 over my car budget, but I will figure it all out. At least I don't have a car payment and a car with a pretty good warranty.",4.6

329,"April 07, 2017","I came in looking for a new car.It was a rainy saturday so i understand it is slow.I walked in with my husband and i saw a few people at their desk.We looked around the sales floor for about 10 min and nobody said anything to us.I finally had to walk up to someones desk and ask to be helped,which the girl was very rude.I then got directed to ms.wilson who was very nice and professional.Me and my husband then filled out a piece of paper on everything we were looking for in a new car,and the price we wanted to spend.So we ended up taking a new 2016 Pearl Hyundai Tuscon home for the night.For some reason the credit website they used was down and they couldn't run our credit which was understandable,but they assured us that what our price limit we wanted was definitely not an issue.Next day we came in when the had finally got the credit system to work we were informed that the price was 200 more a month than originally planned, because of tech packages like a push start button and smart trunk.I asked ms wilson if there was anything cheaper and she showed me one without all the extra packages.We got put back in her office and she left to talk to he manager about the price and if they could get it down any cheaper.My husband than pulled up the website and saw the black 2017 hyundai tuscon which was the cheapest one they had and had the black seats and everything we needed.He than asked ms wilson about it and she acted like she didnt want to show it to us.By then i was mad because why did we told her that in the beginning and i felt because it was the cheapest that is why they didnt want to show it to us.Anyway after the manager which made it seem like he was cutting us a deal on the car he saved us maybe 50 dollars off our note.Before we Signed the papers at that time my sister in law came in.And we let our sales person know that they referred us.She said no problem they will get $200 for the referral.That was 4 months ago and she still has yet to get it.The service people call all the time asking if i need and oil change and i always get told the same thing they are working on it.It is just crazy to me that yall advertise and call me and tell me about referrals yet,my person who referred me still hasnt recieved there part.

338,"March 27, 2017","I was very grateful that this dealership was trying to work with me to get a vehicle in my own name. It's been hard since I don't have the best credit, but after 3 days of being run around I had to take my down payment & trade in vehicle back & walk away. I've purchased 2 new vehicles before & never had this many problems. After 3 days & wasting my weekend I just feel like if this dealership really wanted to sell a vehicle someone would have made the deal. The third day that I went to the dealership I was told not to come after I was half way there because they were too busy to call the bank to negotiate my deal. I'm sorry but that was the straw that broke the camel's back for me. Especially since I live 40 mins away. I'm sorry but that is very bad customer service in my opinion. Also, they have this Apex security system on the vehicles that you supposedly HAVE to purchase. I don't like being told that I HAVE to purchase something like this when I don't want it. I feel like it should be an option if it is not included in price. This dealership & the Kia dealership in Silsbee are the only 2 dealerships that I have been to that do this type of thing & I don't think it is right. I would not recommend anyone to this dealership & will take my business elsewhere in the future.",2.2

407,"October 28, 2016",I worked with a new salesman (Gary Metts) who was very pleasant.

411,"August 23, 2016","Everyone was nice and helpful in finding me a new car. Although, I felt very pressured and rushed to buy the car that I did. I would have liked to been given more space and time to think away from the salesmen.  Also, the day after I bought my car I had to return to the dealership to sign papers because apparently someone messed up the paperwork I signed and put the wrong VIN number to the car I bought. I was very unhappy with having to drive back to the dealer because I live an hour away. I was also a bit taken aback that the manager of the dealership did not apologize for the mistake the dealership made. I work in hospitals and when the hospital makes a mistake not only is the person who made the mistake apologizing but so is the nursing manager. Yes, the dealership filled my gas tank up for the drive I had to make back to them, but my car gets 40mpg and I barely drove it so my gas gauge wasn't even on a half a tank. I had to ask for the financial manager to tell him my concerns, and to me that is unprofessional to have to ask for the manager when he already knew what was going on. I shouldn't have had to make the trip back to the dealership (the paperwork should have been right the first time), but since the paperwork was wrong on the VIN number the manager should have came out and apologized for my inconvenience. And I feel like I should have been able to look into more options that I might have liked better than the elantra instead of being pressured into buying it.",3.4
