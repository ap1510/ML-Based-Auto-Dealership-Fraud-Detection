0,"June 27, 2020","The sales process was quite bad, basically my feeling is that you're a scam. Charging u$s995 for a mandatory upgrade that was supposedly already applied to the vehicle is a scam.

Windows are not tint, there is no treatment on the paint (it was full of water marks), the N2 in the tires a total disaster (5psi difference between tires) so I either have to drive 50 miles to you or I will put regular air. I think the only thing that was truly added to the vehicle are the wheels safety locks (25u$s value).

So again, the sales process for me is a scam. Charging 995 for mandatory upgrade is a scam. Just put the right price online and that's it.

Kenneth was not willing to improve the price one single cent, on top of already charging 995 for non-existent upgrades.

Anyway, the price was good, so I closed the¬†deal. I give it a good thought and would have been a mistake for me losing the deal. But I would not recommend neither do business again with Sterling McCall.",1.0

Today's sales manager, who shouldn't be, Bobby Harris added nearly $4000 to the settled price. When I confronted him he said "" Should have bought it yesterday"" Really? Your a manager? Talking this way to a customer!! I promised Bobby I would place a review to every platform I can find to warn Houston off this crooked place! Yes we have written a letter to Chevrolet to inform them as well",1.0

6,"June 27, 2019","Sterling McCall Chevrolet was the first dealership I reached out to because their online price for a 2019 Chevy Colorado was thousands below any other dealer. Unfortunately, they were unable to honor that price because they could not even find out how they came up with such a discount. The Sales Manager, Christian Garcia, and sales people, Celia and Roy, all failed to get back to me. Anytime I asked a question they couldn‚Äôt answer, they just never responded or called me back. Fortunately, I was able to get the deal I wanted at Autonation Chevrolet West Austin. They were definitely worth the drive. They were transparent, responded immediately, and saved me three thousand dollars. I am certain Sterling McCall posts their online prices just to bait and switch you when you come in or blame you for their failure to deliver. I recommend you go elsewhere if you want to be treated with respect. ",1.0
7,"June 18, 2019","I came into this dealership hesitant about buying a new truck but my salesperson, Brent made it an awesome experience. He was very professional and polite.  What I liked most about him was his honesty. I would highly recommend working with him at this dealership.  ",5.0
8,"May 23, 2019","I have never seen such a practice. Went to the dealership. Looked around. A salesman came out. I asked about a used car and asked for his best price. We went back and forth a bit. We agreed on a price and total offer. He went inside to confirm, he came back out. We went back and forth a bit, agreed on a deal. He went back in to confirm the offer and came out and he said we are good - if you agree we have a deal. So I went in, took my license and started to write up the deal. I asked for the numbers and the manager comes out and starts to give me a song and dance how this was never agreed upon. I had my teenage kids there as well and we were like, you had made a verbal deal, confirmed it, and now you will not honor it. He went on to say we never agreed. That we were lying. The sales guy had no integrity. I would never recommend this dealership or any Sterling McCall network.  Shady business tactics. ",1.0

10,"April 26, 2019","Called @ 7:34 made appointment for 8:15 drop off. Was told to be there 20 mins before appt. I left work and was there by 7:50. Parked in the service entrance and over some time got moved up to the front of the line. Spoke to a guy in a red shirt, told him I had an appointment, no one came out. Then a guy in a blue shirt went and and told the service advisors I was waiting and a guy named Donavan came out shook my hand and asked if I had an appointment. He looked it up and said it was with Sergio. And walked back inside. I waited initial 8:35 and then I left. When I made the appointment I requested a confirmation email that I never received. Appointment was with a guy named Sergio, for a simply 5000 mile oil change, who never came out.  I clearly explained the I also needed to schedule the shuttle so I could get back to work but there was no sense of urgency with the service dept especially with Sergio.  I work in the equipment service industry and would not treat customers how I was treated.  I called as I left and spoke with a lady in the service center and explained to her my experience. She did apologize for them.  I do believe the service manager should be more involved out on the line with their service writers to see how they are treating the very customers who pay their salaries. Very disappointed with the service dept of this dealership. This may seem minor to some but if a simple oil change turns out to be a bad experience then how would a serious vehicle issue turn out.

11,"April 23, 2019","I am the last person to leave someone a negative feedback, but this fellow left me no choice but to warn the up coming customers to this dealership or perhaps this particular fellow.  (Pleasant Abraham)
I picked a car from their sister dealership down the street, liked it driven around and was sold on the price that was advertised for. 
I was there with preapproved from JSC bank with pretty decent financial rate. Did not want to get financed from the Dealer due to my own bank‚Äôs great rates. But since my super nice sales accisites (James/Wolf) insisted that they may offer me better rate. So, why not. I was agree.
I sure was pleased with their hospitality and help they provided during my decision. 
Everything went well until I was taken to this finance department. Let me mention that I was the only customer in waiting area waiting for these guys to take me in and help me get out soon they can. 
It took about 30-35 min. Which is okay. 
But it wasn‚Äôt that easy and ok as much as I thought it would or can be. This fellow I dealt with name (Pleasant Abraham) started working on my case. He was taking his sweet time which is understandable. But no smile on his face must be the work load, I don‚Äôt know. ü§∑???
We had 3,500.00 as a down payment. Once he was done running number around his screen. He straight up told us what our monthly payment will be. 
But I asked him what rate am I getting. He said 4.9% when I went there with 3.4% approved from JSC bank. Told him no we rather just get it done from our bank. He asked us if we have a paperwork to show him... after confirming everything he left the office and returned after while and goes back to his computer screen and gave us another monthly payment. 
My question remained the same what‚Äôs my % rate? He said he will match or beat by one point. ü§¶???
But what‚Äôs the point getting same rate after spending almost 2 hrs For same %. I said it‚Äôs okay we will just keep the banks offer. But thank you. 
Oh, boy.. This guy pissed off or what!? I don‚Äôt know. He with a smirking face gave me a look and said.. What do you want me to do !? Give you a 0%? 
That was pretty rude of him. I got shocked and said oh you are not as plasenst. Are you !? 
He replied I try to be. I acknowledge him that he is being rude. He straight up told me if I am the one who will sign the paper work? Since I wanted the car to be under my little brothers name and I was paying down payment to help him out. So, I said sure he said no you are not you can leave. 
I really was pissed off at this point I told him look we really have to go.. please finish the paper work it‚Äôs already passed 9:15-20 and I have 5 years old baby to pick up from a baby sitter. 
He said you guys can go deal with some one else. And my little brother ask me to stop let him finish. 
So, I figured if I say YES to everything he wants. 
Then I may end up See his pleasant side. 
(Which was no where to be found) smh 
This was my experience guys. I don‚Äôt know about others but this guy definitely don‚Äôt want people to be smart or question him. If you one of those who don‚Äôt like asking question then Mr, (pleasant Abraham) your guy. Good luck 
Or else request a different  finance Manager to deal with. 
Good luck. Because I didn‚Äôt have that after meeting this guy.",2.4
12,"March 04, 2019","Fist off they advertised a truck with what seemed like a decent price.  I emailed back n forth with the sales guy who never mentioned the price shown was for a truck without the customization they did and it wasn't prominent in the online add.  After test driving the truck and getting down to the deal is when I found out the real price.  So I decide, after spending a couple of hours there and the long drive, almost 1 hr, I start looking at another truck.  This is when they started the numbers game, I know all dealers do this to a certain extent but the sales guy and the sales manager start shifting numbers, where it s the same numbers just in different order ect.  Finance was no better either...same game, different department.  Long story short, it was one of those deals where after you just feel like you got taken advantage of from the time you set foot on the lot.  I would never buy another vehicle from Munday Chevrolet again or recommend them to anyone.  In fact 6 months later I bought a fairly new ""used"" car for my wife from Weisner a little further up 45N and it was a totally different experience from sales to finance.  No bait n switch or numbers games.  READ THE BAD REVIEWS AND STAY AWAY FROM MUNDAY CHEVROLET.",1.6
13,"June 26, 2018","I Received a letter in the mail OFFERING to buy my truck to bring it up to munday Chevrolet that they will buy my truck for $52,635.00 even if I don‚Äôt buy a truck. They offered me $7000,00 less and would not give me a print out so I could think it over. Said they won‚Äôt do that it‚Äôs in the system. Seems Really shady to me. Also the guy who sent me the offer would not even meet up with me. -Rodney Crow- .
I would not believe there offers they send to you in the mail and I wouldn‚Äôt trust  these guys.

16,"January 13, 2018","Twice the service advisor does not communicate to customer. Does not communicate with customer concerning recall. Does work on vehicle without communicating with customer. # 2 Does not write down problem with brakes issue. Trys to give customer back vehicle after having it for 5hrs without fixing issue with brakes.  Says brakes are in mint condition.  Does not communicate/ fix grinding issue. I the customer instructed service advisor to put vehicle back up on the rack to show issue of vehicle. Later senior brake guy find the problem where as the junior tech did not find problem. No oversite of junior tech.  This is a dealership. I expect them to know the chevy vehicles more so then any other shop, #3 Senior advisor does not speak to fellow coworkers when he comes in to work nor does he speak to customer after walking pass him twice. Customer met senior service advisor the day before. I do not recommend this dealership for service. You can purchase a vehicle their;however, I do not recommend the service department; however, i did have a better rapport with the two older service advisors (approximately  50 years of age). I will never come back there for service on any of my vehicles. After, being there for 5hrs. I got an oil change,car appraised  and the brakes looked at once. the second time, i initiate to have car back on rack to look at brake issue. I only received a free loan vehicle and only 10 percent off for my troubles. I later decline service on my vehicle. The two older service advisors are the recommended persons to communicate and go to for service needs. if you have to take your vehicle there for service. I continue to see the older service type person are more responsible like Chick-fil-A employees at all the locations  I been too.  I been too five so far.  I would appreciate this website correct the spelling of Chevrolet.

17,"January 12, 2018"," I felt like they lied to me when I got to the dealership they had told me they were going to do a diagnostics that was gonna cost me $137 and they were going to tell me what the issue with the vehicle was and then it was gonna be my decision if I want to pay to fix it they never told me they were going to guess to see what the vehicle had so they said there‚Äôs an issue With a  gateway module but their not sure if that‚Äôs going to fix the problem that was going to cost me $600 and not even know if that‚Äôs going to fix anything the whole reason why I want to a dealership it‚Äôs because my understanding is that they can find the issue  even if it‚Äôs going to cost me more money to fix it but not play the guessing game  and let‚Äôs see if we fix this if it does anything and if not will  move forward and charge you For more repairs that they can fine not knowing if that‚Äôs gonna do anything to the vehicle if I knew I was going to be stuck in the situation and they would‚Äôve told me from the beginning I would‚Äôve went to just any old papa mama shop and did asked to speak to the manager nothing got accomplished this service department really need some work I‚Äôll will probably not be coming here anymore They said the vehicle had a code of B1000 39 and they couldn‚Äôt even tell me where the part is located why would I have to pay $137 if they can tell me anything about the vehicle just that there‚Äôs a bad gateway module  and also when I went to pick up my vehicle because I decided not to fix it it seems like they wanted to kick me out of there as quickly as possible they were Really nice to me from the beginning but when they realize that I wasn‚Äôt going to pay to fix it because They were not  sure if that was going to fix the issue They were pretty much treated me very poorly And my vehicle is also under  warranty on the hybrid system and It has the light service hybrid system but they‚Äôre telling me that doesn‚Äôt cover it it doesn‚Äôt make any sense if my vehicle has warranty on a hybrid system until 100,000 miles and it has a light  service hybrid  system light on it but they kept telling me no that‚Äôs not part of the warranty",1.2

No call so I called again and Ricardo informed me that it would be 39 more minutes and he would call. He didn‚Äôt. I call again and this time no one is picking up the phone. I select the service department and they pickup and put you immediately on hold. I am now pissed!! I raise xxxx with the manager when I get to the dealership because I was told that it was ready and it is not. I asked the manager why did they schedule so many cars on a holiday weekend and inconvenience their customers that are trying to get on the highway for the holiday? He stated that Munday service appointments first and then walk ins. It‚Äôs quite clear that an appointment means nothing for the service department. The last time I took my car for an oil change one of my lugs came up missing. I honestly didn‚Äôt say anything because it took forever that appointment because they never did rotate my tires now check the air. My low air light was still on when I got in the car.

Then when I asked if it could be recalled from the auction, I was told,  the dealership is losing too much money on the car and my offer would just make it worse ....I guess a car going to auction is better.

A week later the car is still on their website....surprise, it‚Äôs available again.  I offered to pay the price advertised, gave the salesman the details for the buyers order and was told I would hear from the finance department in 30 minutes or so, depending on how busy they are. Hours past and then I learned the salesman  took the buyers order to ‚Äúthe tower‚Äù  and they added $2,000.00 to the advertised price because they were losing money on the deal.

64,"August 24, 2017","Monday morning I took my truck as I got a check engine sign. I arrived around 9am before I had to go to work, the service rep said it will be 2-3hours. I asked for a rental to get to me to work and he said he can only do a rental if it would have taken more than a day, but this will be done in 3hours. They offer shuttle service but that takes time, so I had a coworker pick me. I go to work and I don't hear anything until 330pm and I'm told it should be completed within another hour or so. So he called again at 415 and said it will be completed tomw so I will arrange you a rental for this evening. So then I had to get a shuttle pick me from my work which was a 45minute wait after since they came to get me 545. I told the service guy he should've just given me the rental in the morning as now you are just wasting my time. Anyways I did not get out of the dealership til 630ish. So Tuesday it should've been fixed but I don't hear anything back. Then Wednesday I get a call that the vehicle was ready for pickup. I go into pickup and returned the rental, upon asking what was wrong with the vehicle, he said it's the secondary fuel pump, the truck is only 1.5year old with barely 18m miles and I'm already having such issues. He didn't even enoxlain what might have caused or anything. The service I got I was super disqpointed. They need to hire people who are knowledgeable. They don't care about the customers"" urgency on anything. I would not recommend this service center to anyone. ",1.0

Absolutely no consideration what so ever!!! As to service advisor Connie,I would never deal with her again...prior to give the go to replace tire, I had found same tire cheaper at discount tire. I called Chevy informed service advisor, on which she told me just bring copy with me at the time of pick. I got there and had to wait 45 mins for the adjustment because advisor Connie did not inform the appropriate person. So, as you can see even customer advisor don't care!

82,"May 14, 2017","I was highly disappointed with my last visit at Monday Chevrolet.  First of all, I had made an appointment to test drive a vehicle (2017 Chevy Cruze Hatchback) in the show room and when I arrived for my appointment, the vehicle was still in the show room.  I had to wait another hour for the employees to track down all of the keys for all of the vehicles in the show room because all of cars had to be moved so I could test drive the vehicle I was interested in.  I would have understood if I had no appointment, but I was physically at the dealership earlier that day and told them I would be back at 6PM for a test drive.  Then, after the test drive, I knew I wanted to purchase the vehicle.  I was looking into a 3 year lease with 12,000 miles per year.  I am also a family member of a GM employee, so I receive an additional discount.  However, when they came out with the numbers, they wanted me to pay $450 per month for a CHEVY CRUZE.  If you look on Munday Chevrolet's website, the exact vehicle I wanted to purchase was only $175 per month.  When I brought up the website to the store manager, he said that the car has special wheels, which makes the price much higher.  He then said that he has to make some money and that was why he could not offer me a better price.  Yet, as a GM family member, the dealership is not supposed to make any money.  They are supposed to offer us the same deal they would offer themselves.  Additionally, wheels that cost $2,000-2,500 DO NOT more than double the cost of the car monthly.  However, the worst part was that I paid for my father to fly down from Massachusetts to help me buy the car.  As I am young and this is my first large purchase, I knew I would need him to co-sign.  Therefore, I felt swindled because clearly Monday Chevrolet has a major issue with false advertising.  I never would have flown my father down here to Texas for what was clearly a rip-off.  Also as a fun fact, my parents just singed a 3 year lease with 12,000 for a 2017 Lexus RX for $400 per month.  I find it hilarious that a high-end Lexus SUV costs LESS per month than a Chevy Cruze.  Next, after making the above known to the manager who was useless during this entire ordeal, we were finally able to speak with the employee in charge of leases.  She re-ran the numbers with our discount, and it turns out the vehicle would only cost $200 (without rims) or $275 (with rims).  I find it simply amazing that this is the only individual in the entire building that was able to come up with these numbers, especially after the manager had told us he had his 'best people running and re-running the numbers'.  After all of this, you will be surprised to discover that I did end up purchasing the vehicle.  This is only because I love that car and no other dealership in the area had that specific car with the correct packages and in the color I desired.  I really did not want to purchase this vehicle from Monday Chevrolet because I find their establishment completely repulsive.  The employee who took me on the test drive was unable to answer any of my questions, and the manager was only looking to take our money.  I will NEVER recommend Munday Chevrolet to anyone.  In fact, I have specifically told my friends to avoid this establishment at all costs.  As a GM employee family member, I am dumbfounded and disgusted that GM allows this kind of behavior in one of their dealerships.  I hope that something will be done in response to this survey.",1.4

84,"April 18, 2017","On March 15, 2017 I traded in my 2011 Toyota Camary to purchase a 2016 Chevrolet Trax. Upon trading in this vehicle my husband and I completed the new finance documents and were asked when the payment of the Camary would be due. I informed my Finance Manager Jackie Watson of my due date and she notated my March 21 payment. After receiving a call from the previous Finance company (Skopos Financial) a week later regarding my Toyota Camry car payment, I informed Skopos that I traded my vehicle in and Munday Chevrolet would have a check sent out for my remaining balance. After disconnecting the call I proceeded to contact my Munday Sales Representative Reggie Thomas, who told me that the check would be sent out to Skopos Financial who wasn‚Äôt aware of how this process went. I informed Reggie that they are threatening to file this on my credit report and he stated they could not legally report it unless it is 30 days behind. With several calls from Skopos and several calls to Munday, this matter has yet to be resolved. I messaged Reggie Thomas on April 12 and he told me that the check would be mailed out the next day. April 13 I messaged Reggie to follow up on our previous conversation and he stated the check had been mailed out. I called this morning to follow up with Skopos to make sure the check was received and I was informed that they had not received a check. My next month payment is due in 3 days and they informed me that if the check was mailed out on the 13th they would receive it in 10 days. This would make me officially 30 DAYS PAST DUE and would have a derogatory late payment reflecting on my credit report. I called into Munday this morning after receiving no response from Reggie and spoke with a sales manager who was clearly unconcerned about my frustration. This will be the second manager I have escalated to who did not attempt to address my problem. Financial Manager Tyler Bright and I spoke on March 31 when he contacted me to resign the financial documents and expressed an interest in resolving the disaster I was going through. Mr. Bright kept my husband and I waiting for 40 min when we came in to resign our documents and were eventually rerouted to the original Financial Manager Jackie Watson. I had previously expressed my dissatisfaction to Tyler with Jackie Watson, who repeatedly sent me to voicemail anytime I called her. So, to be sat with someone who could not be bothered to address my concerns previously left me in a angered state. It is apparent that neglect and selfishness are the personality traits of Munday Chevrolet once they have acquired all their signatures for payment. I have received no response via email, telephone, or text message regarding a situation that is affecting me caused by YOUR procrastination. I will no longer tolerate this outright disrespect and I demand this situation be rectified. ",1.6

Steve M is definitely a people person and great at what he does in deescalating issues and resolving them in a timely manner. That is the type of service that will keep me as a customer of Munday. Dan and Steve deserve recognition for their assistance with my vehicle.

91,"March 26, 2017","I have been researching and looking to buy a new suburban for quite a while. I had been to a couple of other dealerships but after looking online I went to Munday because they emailed me that they had the vehicle that would work for me. I began working with a salesman that approached me outside, (the salesman that emailed me wasn't there that day) I told him what I was looking for and that I was interested in trading me car in. We went to his ""office"" and he started looking stuff up, he said lets go look on the lot. I asked him if he could get my car appraised while we were looking, which I thought was odd that he wouldn't offer, he took my keys and 20 minutes or so he was back and we went to the lot. We walked around and I began asking questions, within the first few minutes I could tell I was way more knowledgeable than he was about the vehicles. He didn't know hardly anything about them and seemed the least bit interested in me asking all of these questions! Back inside I asked if my car had been appraised and he said oh yea of course, but still didn't have my keys or at least didn't give them back. At this point he brought his sales manager in, he brought some numbers over which included a very low appraisal for my car. I wasn't interested in the deal and was hoping to walk, but still didn't have my keys! They then pulled up a better model car than what I was interested in and brought over a deal for that one. He raised my appraisal amount up $4000 so now comparing the two deals it looked great, well when I pointed out that one deal had one price for the appraisal and the other had a different price he sort of looked at me like oh dumb woman, you weren't supposed to catch that! Then I brought up the vehicle I was emailed about, he worked up some numbers, which were amazing but miraculously the vehicle had just been sold! I asked if he could match those numbers to the car we had looked at earlier and unfortunately he couldn't pull that off! After over 2 hours I was finally able to get my keys back from them and made my way out. 
They were absolutely dishonest by bringing me in about a car that was no longer available and I completely felt hostage with them keeping my keys for so long. A horrible and uncomfortable experience overall!

My old loan is still not paid off and it's been almost three weeks and the wrong utility mat (that i purchased) was placed in the trunk of my car.  I've left several messages and haven't been able to reach someone. It's disheartening to be treated so well initially and disregarded after the purchase. The finance team was great to work with so I have no complaints there.  Hopefully this issue will get resolved soon. ",3.6

Well all i am going to say is Go see Larry Brown in the preowned department, he will get you done and done right and if he see an issue he will let you know what it is and what can be done to get the vehicle.

113,"July 27, 2016","I got into a car accident on June 6,2016, and my car (2013 Ford Focus)  was totaled. The accident wasn't my fault and the other lady's insurance paid off some money on my car. I owed about 13 thousand and some on the car and her insurance company only paid off $9,583.55. Leaving me a balance of about 3 thousand and some change, because I didn't have Gap insurance. My mom referred me to Munday Chevrolet to hopefully get a new car. I went to Munday on June 14,2016 and I met Michael Gilbreath Pre-Owned Sales Consultant. Right off the back I explained to Michael my situation and I also made sure I told him about the balance that I owed. I didn't want no surprises about anything. Michael said he could help me, he helped me look for a car, and he also allowed me to test drive the cars I was interested in. His service was just extremely outstanding, told me the truth and really took his time to help me. Michael's Finance Manager Joey Munoz told him that all I needed is a down payment of $500 and a letter saying that Allstate is paying off the $9,583.55. June 15,2016 I came back with everything that was asked of me and Mike Gibson took my payment. I received my keys to my Toyota Camry 2015 along with all my paperwork. About a week June 22,2016  later I brought my cousin to Michael so he could help him find a car. We aren't even there to talk about me and Joey told me TD Auto Finance LLC didn't finance me, because of the balance that I owed. Joey told me to go to my bank and get some temporary checks, and write out a fake check for 4 thousand dollars. Making it seem like I paid off the balance of my old car, so that the bank can see that it was taken care of. I did what he said because I was desperate to keep the car. That same day I went into my bank and got some checks. Filled out the check then I took a picture and emailed it to Joey ( Finance Manager) just like he told me. July 17, 2016 I tried to pay my car note to TD Auto Finance LLC online and it didn't work it was on a Sunday. The next day Monday Morning I called TD Auto Finance LLC and they told me I'm not in their system. I called Michael to ask him who am I financed with. Just like all my paperwork, he told me TD Auto Finance LLC. I called Mike Gibson another Finance Manger and I explained the problem. He told me it is something Munday messed up on and for me to wait to pay my note. About 20 minutes later Joey Munoz ( Finance Manger) calls me and told me, we only have two days to find me a bank that will finance me. If no bank would finance me I would have to give the car back and get my down payment back. I found out that I had a extended warranty and I needed to cancel that, so that would take off 2 thousand and some from the 3 thousand that I owed. I canceled my extended warranty and so now my balance left on my old car is only 1 thousand and some. Joey said that's still not going to work, and he asked if I could get someone to co-sign for me. July 18, 2016 I came back with my best friend so that she could co-sign for me. She had a copy of her social security card and Joey said he needs the original because the bank wouldn't take that. So my best friend and I left came back with in 15 minutes with her original. Even though we brought back her original social security and nothing had changed. Joey said that it's fraudulent and that the only things I could do now, is pay off the balance then come back. I didn't have all the money to pay off my balance at the time so Joey Munoz took my car key to the Toyota. Basically putting me out and he didn't want to no longer help me. I was supposed to get my refund that same day and that didn't even happen. I had to go back up to Munday two days later to get my refund. Joey Munoz lied to the general manger about what happened. So when I asked to speak with the general manager, he didn't even want to talk to me. I called corporate and no one ever called me back !

I will never go back to Munday Chevrolet the experience was just so unprofessional. Michael Gilbreath did everything that he could. Joey Munoz never communicated to me about what was going on until it was too late. I did everything that I was told to do and all in the end I loose the car. It was just lies on top of lies and how do you leave a dealership without being financed with a bank?",1.6

My entire vehicle purchase experience was wonderful, especially with having the opportunity to work with Mike in finance again!! Keith Moore sold me my 2010 Camaro through a previous dealership and since that excellent car buying experience, I have followed him to Munday for all my car buying needs. My recent purchase from Keith was a 2016 Tahoe LT Texas Edition but I would also like to mention that he was the finance manager on the 2016 Equinox that I purchased in December and he did an excellent job at that as well. He was reliable, honest and listened to my requests on past purchases and he was even better this time around!! I believe a lot of car salesman do not care about the individuals they sale to, just the sale itself but if you find the RIGHT salesman, just as I have in Keith Moore (I will continue to follow him if he decides to leave Munday), then I believe your car buying experience can be exceptional!! With all my purchases, I have told him upfront what I'm working with as far as a down payment, if I have any trades, how much I'm looking to spend and where I would like my monthly payments to be at and with all my purchases all I had to do was walk in, sign the papers (everything exactly as I requested) and drive away a HAPPY, HAPPY customer!!! I don't regret dealing with Keith or Munday Chevrolet and I will continue to buy from Keith and recommend him and the fine staff at Munday Chevrolet to EVERYONE I know‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶and as far as I‚Äôm concerned, Keith should be in a management position, he's that good!!

I was impressed with that level of service for such a minor vehicle to the Dealership, but apparently that is how Munday Chevrolet is.  It seems everyone is treated equally whether it is a $17,000 car or a $70,000 car.  You have no idea how important that little act was to me and I can not express my gratitude enough.

Not only he explained clearly the service to me at Munday service building. He also give some answers and instructions via emails on concerns I have had off my service schedule.

Munday does have excellent facilities for his customers coming for services.Those of us who has a tight schedule. My suggestion is to set up a schedule for service. It is pretty fast and you will be reminded a day before your service schedule.

Munday does have a team of professional service advisors with a  five-star service.

134,"October 21, 2015","This is my 2nd used car purchased from them, the reason? no high pressure sale tactics. The first car had a bad film on it, made the windshield not good, they wouldnt fix but sent me to a shop they used and I paid 150.00. Just traded that car for another better used car. Same thing, crud all over the vehicle, and when I noticed they hadnt cleaned it off as agreed I checked the air filter and cabin filter, both filthy. No oil change sticker either. So I had the oil changed 52 bucks, changed the filters out myself to save money, 35 bucks, and tried all types of cleaners for 2 days trying to get that stuff off the windshield and other glass. Finally found something that took it off but took alot of elbow grease. I called the salesperson through out this and he asked did the people who changed your oil look and see if it was dirty? and suggested I use steel wool on the glass. What a crock! Once you sign, you can bet nothing else will be done for you. I waited 2 hours for them to prep this vehicle and they didnt do it and charged me for it. Not one value stem, dirty filters, crud all over the car, and didnt change the oil. Given the opportunity to make this right, they claim after all this they still did a dealer prep. So now I know that I paid 150 for a windshield on the other vehicle was unnecessary as well. Buyer beware!!! they will lie and will not make it right if you prove to them with pictures that they didnt do it. They will not get anymore of my business and I was loyal customer. They are not close to my home and I went all that way thinking they would treat me fairly. I just had to buy this second vehicle before I compared their same tactics and same excuses.

It was like they were trying to wear us down as most of that time we were just left sitting there. I felt sorry for our salesman, who appeared very green and kept apologizing because his English wasn't so good.

A few weeks later we received a call from our salesman telling us to bring our vehicle in, they needed to inspect it again. Apparently this was due to the new registration laws. My husband called and our salesman told him it would probably take a couple of hours. My husband told them he didn't have two hours to wait and they said he could leave it there and they would give him a loaner to drive.

Once he got to the dealership however, he was told by the service writer they could get right on it.  After waiting for 2-1/2 hours he left the waiting room area to see if he could see our vehicle. This is when he ran into the service writer who looked surprised to see him. My husband is too kind ... I would have blown a gasket! The service writer only made eye contact and disappeared. 

A few minutes later the service writer reappeared and said that there was a problem .... Get this ...apparently everyone that does the inspections had left for the day. No more mister nice guy .... My husband explained that he had been waiting for 2-1/2 hours for something that should take 1/2 an hour and it was apparent that he had simply been forgotten about. 

In the end they actually stopped a guy from leaving, and he was able to inspect our vehicle which took all of 20 minutes. The inept customer service continued when my husband was waiting to check out and get his keys. He was told by the desk clerk someone would bring his vehicle around and she hung his keys on a hook waiting for yet another person to bring around a vehicle that was already sitting just out the door.

147,"May 21, 2015","I would think twice before getting your oil changed at Munday. I've been there several times but think I finally learned my lesson. My first oil change was a drive up (No Appt). Service guy told me 45 mins.... ended up being 2 hours. He was apologetic (didn't seem like it was the first time he had to apologize to a customer that day alone). However, I missed my meeting because my car was being serviced for 2 hrs. I was literally on the rack for an hour and a half to change the oil. And then they wanted to charge me like $20 extra because my tires were bigger. They are still tires, same amount of lug nuts, just a few inches taller. No extra work needed. Second visit, thought I had them this time. I called and made an appt. Drove in 15 mins till my appt. and bam!!!!  2 hours later my buzzer went off and truck was being pulled around. 2 hours again with an appt mind you!!!! Third time, yes I did it again, made an appt and arrived on a tight schedule so I asked the service guy before taking my truck with an ""appt"" and he told me it will take 2 hours. I told him no I do not have that kind of time and asked him why so long with an appt. and he pointed to the cars in front. I asked him if they have appts and he reluctantly said ""not all of them"". So why don't I go in front of those without appointments? He said he cannot do that and joked and said ""You know why it takes so long?"", why I said? He said ""Because they want you top walk around and buy a new truck."". I said well that is BS and not everyone wants a new car when they get their oil changes and I left. The fourth and probably the last time, I was driving by and said let me see how long they will tell me on a oil change without an appointment. Sure enough he told me 2 hours and I said no thank you. My biggest complaint more than the 2 hour oil changes is that whether you have an appointment or not means nothing. You still end up in the queue of which you got there. So, if you have a 2pm appt and 3 cars pull up at 1:50 without appt guess where you go??? That's right!!! To the rear!! Oh and if you complain about why its taking longer than they told you, they will say its the new system that sets up the appointments. ",2.2

I just noticed in your note you stated GMS (which is employee discount). I qualify for Supplier
Discount (not employee). Can you confirm that you will honor GM Supplier Discount on a new
2015 Vette order?
====================

With that 2nd written confirmation to compliment the phone calls I was having with their sales staff I took time off and traveled that week to their dealership and placed my order with supplier pricing credentials included, just as they told me to.  Everything was going good until the following week I received a call from them saying the general sales manager would no longer honor supplier pricing as they had promised me (in writing twice).  I guess they expected me to just keep the order with them since I already had it in place but I quickly cancelled it and then reached out to the general sales manager for an explanation.  Several days later and he still has not responded.  
I logged a complaint with the BBB and moved on to place my order elsewhere.

This was worsened when I discovered that the door handle still  needed to be ordered and the rotation had resulted in  the tire service monitor system malfunctioning. A week later I was notified that my door handle arrived. This time I wasn't going to sit for five hours, so I had my 75 year old mother drive me to the dealership where we left my car. I waited all day and finally called the dealership to discover that nothing had been done, and the car would need to be picked up in the morning.

We wanted something used and it didn't have to be fancy.  We were told no problem.  Also we advised them that my mother was in the market for a vehicle as well and had a large down payment.  
My mom fould the vehicle she wanted and after back and forth with the bank we selected a vehicle that they said the bank would accept.  We were there for hours waiting on what I don't know, only to be told that the bank closed and that they wouldn't have a response til the next business day which was Monday.
They called my mom and said they had everything taken care of and she could come in and get her car, they never called my husband and when he called they just said come out.  Then they called him back and asked if my mom would cosign for my husband.  He was like no, I just paid off a car 6 months ago and paid it off early with no late payments.

Needless to say we get out there and the salesman that was helping us was not there and SAL Watson helped us.  He was rude very arrogant.  He asked my husband again about my mom cosigning and my husband and mom said no.  He gave my mom one spr and she questioned it because of her credit score (he never had our paperwork in front of him to tell us exact figures) he left came back and said you are right the apr is less.  She asked what kind of deal can you work out if I pay cash for the car.  He was like nothing so I took over.  He demeanor and attitude was horrible.  He told us we came to them and I was like y'all call us and you can't make money unless someone buys a car.
Needless to say my mother took her money and left.  They just point blank told my husband they couldn't get him approved.
My husband went to another dealership and they said we have an approval from a bank that said y'all were already approved at Munday chevy with a co signor (which was my mom).  My husband was livid.  He nor my mom ever gave consent for the dealership to submit a loan with both of them on it.
We called the dealership and spoke to SAL, once again the arrogant attitude came out and he said my mom gave consent (lies) she was sitting there and said I never consented for y'all to do this.  SAL then starts laughing and joking with others in the background saying we have a disgruntal customer on the phone.
We hung up and called the manager, no response.

We are making it our person mission to tell everyone about the shady dealings of this dealership.

My husband went to Autonation Chevy on the gulf freeway and has the exact truck he wanted.  My mom went to Sterling mccall Nissan on sw freeway (excellent service) and has a brand new 2014 nissan versa sedan no cosignors.

Just the other day I received a denial letter from a finance company stating that my husband was approved at Munday cheverolet but the approval expired. (But I thought he couldn't get approved)

The process was easy, Hyder did most of the work, got me a great deal and threw in some extras that just made the purchase even more great. Even though I just bought this new vehicle I can see myself returning to buy another car from the same dealership.

Everyone I met with there was extremely helpful and polite along with being absolutely professional and made me feel at ease with buying my vehicle. I actually enjoyed the experience, it was painless.


The car I wanted wasn't in stock, I wanted one of the popular colors that the dealership did not have in stock, but that did not hinder Hyder from putting me in the exact car I was looking for.

I only spent 2 1/2 hours there and drove off with my first brand new car in 18 years.  Oscar and Mark were very supportive and friendly.  There was no haggling, and I did not feel pressured at all.

185,"July 22, 2013","I just want to let everyone know that I had the most awesome experience ever here at Munday Chevrolet. I am 26 years young and to have the guidance and direction of Hyder Alkhazali and Ryan was awesome. They answered everyone of my questions and I did not feel as if I was bothering them or annoying them as other car dealers make you feel. On Saturday, was the first time I bought a car in my name and I will forever be grateful and feel accomplished. Mike Gibson the financial manager was great as well.I didn't feel obligated to purchase any warranty or anything like that. He provided the details and explained the reason he suggested something for me and I went with his expertise! Genna Morris was very friendly and explained the details if my brand new car.

When the car arrived at the dealership, Hyder was quick to contact me.¬† My overall experience at the dealership far exceeded my expectations.¬† I have been to numerous other places both purchasing for myself and helping others.¬† I have always felt pressured or rushed to make decisions.¬† Talking to Hyder was very refreshing.¬† Everything was very well explained and I felt comfortable in my purchase throughout.",5.0

Hyder told me that he would love the chance to earn my business and that he would do what ever he could to make sure that I got what I wanted for the price I wanted. Well he did what he said he would and he earned my business by being strait forward, honest and not pushing me to get anything I did not want.

190,"June 25, 2013","Hyder Alkhazali is absolutely amazing! If you are in search of a vehicle, I highly recommend Hyder Alkhazali, with Munday Chevrolet. I have always been one to absolutely hate the stress of buying a car, the games they play, and the lack of morals and integrity that is missing in most of the industry. I usually walk in and say immediately... No BS, no haggling and definitely do not try to push numbers around to make a sale. But, from the moment I stepped foot on Munday Chevrolet's lot, I was totally amazed at the difference between this dealership and the other three.... I had stopped by earlier in the day. It was absolutely nothing like that. I was in search of my perfect vehicle and the right deal, without being pushed for less of a vehicle, or putting double the money down. Hyder immediately made the deal happen. No haggling, no good salesperson and bad Finance department games at all. No pushing for $2000 more down, or the feeling you were being taken advantage of. No walking out thinking, ""whoa"" what did I really just sign? Or why did I buy this truck? It's not even the one I wanted! Every single person there was real, had personality and not a smooth talker. I can honestly say, I will buy every car from Hyder. So, Munday Chevrolet, I want to give a great ""shout out"" to you for having Hyder Alkhazali. Honesty and Integrity is absolutely what I received from Hyder and Munday Chevrolet. Believe me, Hyder can make some miracles happen. Please ask for Hyder, he cares and you will see that right away. So, as you can tell I am ""super excited"" with my new Chevy Texas Edition black pickup and the business model of Munday Chevrolet. Thank you Hyder.",5.0
191,"June 22, 2013","Had a great experience at Munday Chevrolet. Hyder Alkhazali helped us find the perfect first car for my daughter. He was very patient as we had many concerns with safety, affordability and efficiency for a car for her. After our first visit he followed up with us, but was not pushy. He sent us photos and suggestions as to what he thought we might like and that was greatly appreciated. We feel we got a great car that met all of our needs and expectations and my daughter was thrilled, to say the least. We will definitely be going back to Hyder when it comes time to purchase a new family car in a few months. ",4.8

As we returned from a test drive he was out the door immediately so I know he was watching for our return. He indicated his sincerity that he wanted our business and he proved his sincerity by his work that resulted in his getting our business. He explained every step of the process and patiently explored all of our options to help us get the best deal and stay as close to our financial parameters. Buying a car is a long and tedious process but he made it very enjoyable.  We all shared alot of laughs. This was an eleven hour journey from the moment we stepped out of the house and started car shopping. We were so tired and yet when we entered Hyder's office after the test drive he was so thoughtful that there was a bottle of water for each of us, my son, my husband and myself.

196,"May 30, 2013","We showed up at Munday Chevrolet with the intent to purchase a Tahoe in the future --not on this day.  We told Arturo what we wanted in a Tahoe and he only showed us the models that had the items we told him were must haves. He was very honest and personable and a pleasure to work with.  He did his very best to get us everything we wanted while giving us a good deal!  His manager Daniel Kelly stepped in once we found the one and helped to get us the best deal possible.  Daniel even went to the extent to bring our 2 1/2 year old who had enough of car shopping a balloon to deter her attention for a little bit longer while we continued to negotiate.  Everyone there did a great job and was very sweet to our little girl who was antsy.  Daniel later met us in finance to bring her another toy to keep her mind occupied.    Our finance guy Mike Gibson was awesome as well.  He was super personable and made a spot on the floor and provided our child with a homemade coloring book while we signed papers.  

I have been back since for some after market items and both Daniel and Arturo remembered me and asked me how I was liking my Tahoe.  A salesman named Joshua was super helpful in explaining my entertainment system to me and walking around the dealership to help me find Arturo and Daniel.

What I experienced at Munday was totally unexpected. My salesman Hyder met me on the lot while I was looking at cars, he was friendly and very helpful in helping to select the car I was looking for. I never felt pressured or aggravated in the whole process. We did not have to play the game and waste several hours of the salesman running back and forth to the sales manager trying to haggler of the deal. We told him up front what we were looking for and he came back with it the first time. Once we picked the car out thru the negotiating, finance and waiting for the car to be detailed the whole process was only 2 hours. It was such a nice experience before I left I traded my other car in for a used Jeep I fell for on the lot. In a span of 3-1/2 hours I purchased 2 used cars.

We worked on some numbers and Jason helped with getting the trade in price where i wanted and getting the truck services and out the door for me. The finance agent, Mike was very helpful to me and quick as well with signing all the paperwork. I had a problem with the truck a day or two later, but instead of turning me away because it was a used truck with no warranty, they took it back in, put me in a 2013 loaner car and fixed me truck up. I would recommend this dealership to anyone because i have been to many dealership in Houston for several of my trucks over the years and these guys were great to me.

It is now another week later and no call. Have since read a couple of reports suggesting Zilliacks does what he wants and gets full support from the owner Bill Munday.

The sales person said all work was completed at their partner dealership less than 3 miles away.  Turns out Munday farms out the work to small incompetent auto shops in the ghetto 16 miles away.  While my rims were at the ghetto shop my Carmaro was at Munday and the put a huge DENT/SCRATCH in my door.  It was so bad it would take weeks for them to repair.  They would not replace with a new door even though I had just purchased the car from them the prior day.  Kevin, Munday GM, only offered me a salvaged door.  When I told Kevin I purchased a new car and wanted a new door he informed me Munday often uses salvage parts on ‚Äúnew cars‚Äù.  This seems very misleading to consumers who think they are buying a new car.  Also, Munday was incompetent they could not apply my racing stripes without air bubbles‚Ä¶ a 3 year old could have done better.

I recommend that Munday put Keith in a leadership role because he can definitely teach a thing or two about honesty, customer service and how to treat customers! In all my adult years of purchasing anything, never have I found a more AWESOME, KNOWLEDGEABLE, FRIENDLY, HONEST, salesman that has the ability to communicate via email so that everything is ready when you show up and all you have to do is sign the paperwork, this is extremely important in today's busy world.

216,"May 08, 2012","Extremely poor service from Enterprise Car Rental Onsite and poor assistance from Munday Chevrolet - what a disappointment.  I received excellent service from Louis over the phone (and when delivering my vehicle for service the next day).  I asked about car rental and he transferred my call to Enterprise Car Rental on site.  I spoke with a woman by the name of Ebony and told her I was dropping my car off for service the next day at 7:30 am and would need a car rental and she gave me an appointment for the following morning.  Things went downhill from there.  The following day, I dropped my car off at 7:30 and Louis directed me to the Enterprise cubicle in the dealership.  There was a note from Ebony stating that she was out back washing cars.  I waited for over 40 minutes for her to return.  I brought it to the attention of several people within the dealership and their attitude was that it wasn't their problem, it was enterprise's.  The receptionist at the front desk was only willing to page her (which wasn't effective) and told me that I would have to call the Enterprise 1-800 number.  I spoke with a Munday Chevrolet service manager who is located closest to the car rental desk and all he was willing to do was another ineffective page.  Ebony resurfaced around 8:10 and said that I technically wasn't at the enterprise desk at precisely 7:30 since I was dropping my vehicle off with Louis at service and she had no obligation to wait for me.  I asked to speak with her manager and she advised that I would have to call her manager on my cell phone.  I attempted to make that call and was placed on hold for another 10 minutes.  I explained to Ebony that the 40 minute delay was a huge inconvenience and she was not willing to offer any type of compensation or facilitate a call with her manager.  My experience at Munday was off to a great start but I was greatly disappointed when the Enterprise desk was left unmanned for 40 minutes at peak morning pickup hours and the Munday employees were uninterested in helping me resolve the issue and at least find the Enterprise employee.  While they say it is not their problem, it effects the overall customer experience and it could have been resolved by having someone walk to the back where Ebony was washing cars.

225,"May 14, 2011","My initial visit to the dealership turned out to be a very negative experience.  Had I not been dealing with a major health issue at the time and on strong pain meducation which clouded my normal cautious nature and reluctance to make such a major and costly decision I would have walked out several times during the negotions with the salesman, Burke.  I have to say this for him- he is persistent.  And I really did think I wanted an Equinox.  Problem was and still is, he did not seem to know much more about the vehicle than I did.  

After signing the contract with my foggy mind and having been hammered by this person for over two hours we went to introduce me to my new car  (or is it a truck??  I really do not know.  I was shocked when I got the license plates and they were for a truck).  The introduction to my new very high tech vehicle began with the following statement by the salesman who had all the time in the world until he got my money ""I am going to have to rush through this because they are calling me to come back inside"".  I did not realize the significance of that until I tried to drive off.  I did not even know how to get out of the lot, the air conditioner was on full-blast, the heated seats were very hot as was the outside temperature, and I knew how to operate none of it.   I realize that I am to blame for not being prepared to make such a purchase at that time and have wished numerous times that I could undo the whole thing.  I have been purchasing autos since I was 17.  I kept my last vehicle for over 10 years, loved it and wish I had it back instead of this car/truck, but since that cannot happen I will hopefully learn to like the Equinox.  Or at least to live with it since I really overpaid for the thing.

Anyway, I have had subsequent contact with others at your dealership who were very nice, knowledgable, and helpful.  Scott Mongonia took care of an auto body problem for me, which was serious in my estimation and required you all keeping my vehicle for several days.  He was wonderful and changed my whole attitude about the situation and the dealership.  He is professional, caring, knowledgable, and gets done exactly what is needed and what he promises.  when I came to pick up my Equinox he put me in the care of another person who is also a major asset to your business, Josue (can't find his card nor remember his last name). Josue spent over an hour going over all the technical stuff with which this LTZ is equipped.  He also told me to call him with other questions or help I needed at any time.  I left the lot that day feeling like things were going to be alright and that there are knowledgable and caring people at Munday that I will be able to call on when my vehicle needs attention in the future.

227,"April 04, 2011","Burke Showed us around the dealership and let us test drive the 3 vehicles we were interested in. We left and visited a Buick dealer and test drove their vehicle and decided the Chevrolet Equinox was the best deal for us. We went back to Munday Chevrolet and Burke had left for lunch and Bob assisted us.
My wife and I were completely satisfied with the dealership and staff.

228,"April 04, 2011",The car dealer had the nicest staff and is the on;y one I would recommend out if the 3 new car dealers I have purchaced from in the last 5 years.  I felt they offered a good price and a fair trade in.  This is also the first car dealer I have purchaced an extended warrenty from.,5.0
229,"March 14, 2011","This has to be the very best Dealership that I have ever used.  Friendly, courteous and willing to work with the customer to get the best Deal.  Goes the extra mile and makes the customer feel that they are Number 1.  I have used other Chevolet, Ford and Lincoln Dealers, and this group exeeds them by a mile.  I would reommend this Dealership and employee's to anyone who is serious about buying a car.  They listen to you and try their best to get what you want for the best price possible.  I can't say enough about them, especially Keith Moor.  This was my first experience at buying on line and will not be my last.  Outstanding, pretty much sums it up.  I went into this sale expecting the worst and wound up getting the best deal I could ask for.",5.0
230,"March 04, 2011","From the get go Mr. Navarro was very pleasant and eager to help us find the truck we loved. He went above and beyond to please me and my husband. I feel that he found me a good deal and was geniune in his behavior to make us feel happy and satisfied with our purchase. He made follow up calls and bargained for me back and forth till we got the truck we wanted at the price we wanted. I was very happy with him and appreciated all his work. Now when we got to our finance manager John Ivanic, well let me just tell you what a pleasure it was to deal with him again!! We did our paperwork with him in 11/2010 when we purchased or preowned 2009 Tahoe there. So it was like seeing an old friend. Again he made us feel welcomed and helped us achieve the best deal possible for us. He encouraged us to buy the GAP ins and overall was very helpful. When we got to the point of our orientation for our new truck with Josue Moreno, that also was a very nice experience. We learned alot and was very informative. He also was very nice and answered all our questions and made sure we left happy and satisfied with our purchase. We are very pleased with Munday and will continue to go there for future purchases because your staff truley is the best at what they do!!",5.0
231,"February 17, 2011","Josh Moreno is an outstanding sales professional. He treated my wife and myself like VIP's, with his courteous, cheery, and efficient conduct. His knowledge about his products is very impressive and he clearly answered all the questions that we had.
We did not feel one iota of sales pressure from Josh. I am 68 years old and I can honestly say that this is the most satisfying and pleasant vehicle purchase experience I've had, ever. Usually, finding, selecting and purchasing a vehicle is quite a tedious and time consuming process, an event I find necessary, but something I don't enjoy or find pleasant. Thanks, to Josh Moreno,the time we spent at Munday dealership turned out to be a very satisfying and pleasant experience. Two of his colleagues there are to be commended also. Mark Ake, the Finance Manager/Officer, and Genna Harris, Customer Service Director. Part of the buying process that I really don't look forward to are the paperwork process and customer service ""orientation"". Mark's efficiency in doing the financing and other paperwork is most impressive which made it seemed like a breeze. Usually, at this stage of the buying process, I would be quite exhausted and ready to call it a day, and I believe my wife shared this feeling with me over the many years of purchasing vehicles but Mark went through the ""tons"" of paperwork required, in such a courteous, cheery,and friendly way that I found myself actually enjoying the time I spent in his office. Genna's courteous, cheery, genial, and efficient way of explaining information, that my wife and I needed to know, was most pleasant and she even went out of her way to take us to the shop manager about an appointment for an oil change which I appreciated very much, but I really didn't need this free service. Thank you, Munday Chevrolet, you made our day because of your outstanding employees! We will buy our next vehicle from you again.

P.S.
Forgot to tell you that my son, who is in the U.S. Army Infantry, and his wife, bought two vehicles from your dealership about a couple of years ago and highly recommended Munday Chevrolet to us, which is why we went there in 2009 and bought a Silverado pick up truck. We just traded that one in for the 2011 Silverado pick up truck we bought from Josh Moreno.",5.0
232,"February 15, 2011","Both Matt Kaczmarski and John Wood went above and beyond to get me into my new Malibu. When I walked in, I had a negative attitude from hearing no from all of the other dealerships. But, they wouldn't let me loose my faith. Words can't express how grateful I am to them. They truly showed me great customer service :).

I had amazing help from Kevin Allen and Kieth Moore.  They made sure everything went smooth and quick.  It was a great expierence and I would recommend them to anyone.,5.0
234,"February 01, 2011",I was very pleased with how well everyone worked to get me into the brand new camero. They did everything that I asked and with a smile. I had went to another chevy dealership to get a trade in estimate on my suburban and they were horrible. Buying a car from Munday was fast and simple. I look forward to my next purchase with them and have already recommended them to others looking for a new vehicle.,5.0
235,"January 31, 2011",I walked in the delarship to test drive a vehicle. The one I was interested in did not meet my finances. The salesman went out of his way to help me make a good decision on the right vehicle for me. He was very knowledgeable and personable and treated me like I was his only customer. I have a poor financial record and the finance people were very helpful and knowledgeable in getting the loan I needed to drive out the door with a new vehicle. Customer Service helped me understand my new vehicle and was very anxious to help me understand all of the information that comes with a new vehicle.,5.0
236,"January 22, 2011","I purchased a couple of Astro Vans from Munday many years ago, so I already new that I was dealing with a great dealer ship that takes care of its customers.
I have a friend that works for Munday, so when I was ready to get my muscle car of  my dream‚Äôs he told me who to see. I met with Karl and it wasn't long that I got a great price for my trade in and new car. The next thing I knew is my wife and I was driving home in the dream of my life Car!! Everybody I worked with was great and very personable, which in this time of life, it‚Äôs hard to find. So today I was driving my new Blue 2011  Camaro SS2RS with white strips and everybody is looking and wishing that was them, just like I did before I got mine. I will let them know that Karl at  Munday can get them in their car of their dreams, without any hassles!

242,"December 27, 2010","My experience started with the GM, Kevin Allen. Mr. Allen advised the process would be non-aggressive & even enjoyable from his Staff. OMG, Munday Chevrolet really is a rare Auto Dealership. From Daniel/Sales to Mark/Finance, they offered me top dollar for my trade and secured a low financing rate for my new Tahoe. 

Almost forgot I was actually in an Auto Dealership environment. It's true, an ""Enjoyable"" experience from the front door of the Dealership to sitting in the drivers seat of my new 2011 Tahoe.   

Highly Recommend...............

Professionalism

Knowledge of Product

No Pressure to Buy

I had visited with my sales person several times so he knew exactly which car to go to.  Although he offered to show me other cars, I knew the first one was the one.  I am loving my 2011 Chevy Equinox.  It is comfortable and easy to handle and has so many features that help me get through my day.  I really LOVE the automatic hatch-it's the best!",5.0

247,"November 15, 2010","This is my second experience with Munday Chevrolet and the entire van/truck buying experience was wonderful, especially this time around because I followed Keith Moore from Mack Haik Chevrolet and he is the salesman that sold me my Camaro. He was excellent then and even better this time around. I believe ALL dealerships can have salesman that appear to be scam artist but if you find the RIGHT salesman, just as I have in Keith Moore (I will continue to follow him if he decides to leave Munday), then I believe your vehicle buying experience can be exceptional!! With both experiences I have told him upfront what I'm working with as far as a down payment, if I have any trades and all the information about those trades, how much I'm looking to spend and where I would like my monthly payments to be at. Both experiences all I had to do was walk in, pick out the vehicle I wanted, sign the papers (everything exactly as I requested) and drive away a HAPPY, HAPPY customer!!! I don't regret either deal I have made with Keith and I would recommend him to ANYONE I know and as far as I am concerned, he should be in a manager position, he's that good!!

Great job Kieth!!!",5.0

He was able to get our financing at the monthly payment  that we were hoping for,including the extended warranty. Also,Brian in service,for his going all out to help me when I needed to locate my license plates. The whole staff at Munday Chevrolet were all very professional and always willing to help us. They should all be commended for their dedication.

 My wife and I both would both like to say ,Thanks, for making our new car purchase such a great experiene...
