9,"May 03, 2019","Let my wife take her QX80  in for the first service @ 5k miles and the service advisor Keith told her she had to have a high speed wheel balance done. Charged her additional $50, for unnecessary service. That will be the first and last time I use their service department.  ",1.0

However, I want to thank Banca in housekeeping for keeping it so nice and clean. One can tell the difference when she isn‚Äôt there.

11,"January 13, 2019","My wife and I came to the Sewell Infiniti dealership in North Houston on New Years Eve 2018 only planning to consider buying a pre-owned QX80. We have always purchased pre-owned vehicles in the past, but after listening to our needs and budget, our Sales Associate Ryan Smith made us an offer on a brand new 2019 QX80 that we simply couldn‚Äôt refuse. Sewell was able to bring the price of a new car below what other dealerships were offering for a pre-owned vehicle. The vehicle we drove home in is beautiful, loaded with extras, and priced within our budget. 

Ryan Smith was incredibly helpful throughout the process. I have visited several Sewell competitors in the months leading up to our purchase and at each of them, the Sales Associate I worked with was disappointing. I would ask technical questions about the vehicles and they didn‚Äôt know the answers. They weren‚Äôt familiar with what vehicles they had in stock. They were less than professional in their communication styles. Mr. Smith represented a world of difference.

Mr. Smith actually listened to our needs and was direct and truthful when a vehicle wasn‚Äôt exactly what we wanted. He talked about the trade-offs of different model years and option packages. He was completely professional and communicated with the plain, simple honesty we were looking for. He is technically knowledgeable and made us aware of some vehicle functions that no one had ever pointed out before. Since the sale Mr. Smith has continued to be helpful by answering questions, assisting with maintenance scheduling, and providing advice.

If you‚Äôre considering the purchase of an Infiniti vehicle, see Ryan Smith at Sewell North Houston. Sewell Automotive should be proud to employ a Sales Associate like Ryan Smith.",5.0
12,"January 08, 2018","I can‚Äôt begin to describe how our experience was at this dealership, but I would like to say I totally recommend this place if you are looking for a car. Their online inventory is true to date and we were able to check out the car we wanted without once being pushed to check other cars, say more expensive, or any other nonsense. 
Our sales representative was a very nice understanding man, Shane Gee, and we were very pleased with his expertise and his ability to meet our particular needs, and adapt to what we wanted and making it happen.
What can I say, the are great, and they have really good prices as well compared to other dealerships in and around the Houston area. 
Totally recommend this dealership and if you want truly exceptional service, ask for Shane Gee.",5.0

14,"June 06, 2013","I was first introduced to Sewell Infiniti of Houston when Crystal Duong followed up on my Internet inquiry. We arranged a test drive on a JX35 for my wife and I that Sat.  Crystal was nothing but helpful. She showed us all of the features on the JX and after the test drive my wife and I both fell in love with the SUV. I asked Crystal if she was ready to sell us the JX but I wasn't going to make it easy. We wanted an emerald graphite exterior with graphite interior and it wasn't on the lot. Back in the office Anthony the sales mgr found one just like we wanted out of state, I figured since it had to be trucked in they would be harder to deal with on the price so I put on my boxing gloves and prepared to do battle. I had done my homework and knew what I wanted to pay and was ready for a long afternoon but within 15 minutes Crystal and Anthony had offered me a terrific deal. This was the first and only time that I truly enjoyed myself while buying a car. Sewell Infiniti has been exceptional after the sale as well, we have even rsvp'd on the technology class they offer to better understand the gadgets. I Would highly recommend Sewell Infiniti to any of my friends and family. ",5.0
15,"March 12, 2013","We went to Sewell Infiniti on March 9, 2013 as we were interested in purchasing a new vehicle.  We arrived at the lot and were immediately greeted by Anisia Morales. She efficiently answered all our questions regarding the 2 vehicles we were interested in, and then arranged test drives for both. She patiently waited for me to decide on which vehicle I wanted, offered guidance and practical opinions on my concerns, and even happily arranged an additional test drive for me. This was, by far, one of the most pleasant experiences we‚Äôve had in purchasing a new car and it‚Äôs all due to Anisia! She is an effective sales person who truly has the customer‚Äôs best interests in mind ‚Äì we really felt that she was working towards meeting our needs in the negotiating process.  Anisia, and her sales team, QUICKLY worked out a mutually agreeable sales price for the vehicle. This process took very little time as it is apparent that Sewell is committed to sell their vehicles at reasonable prices. We were then assisted by Darrell Kennedy in the financing department. He arranged equitable financing for the vehicle, and did not hard sell any upgrades or options. However, Infiniti does offer a variety of quality options such as prepaid maintenance on their vehicles with excellent price points. If you are interested in purchasing a new vehicle and desire a pleasant, trouble-free experience, I suggest you connect with Anisia Morales!",5.0
16,"February 27, 2013","Our experience with Eva @ Sewell Infiniti North Houston was fantastic.  We called on a Monday afternoon asking what they could do for us since we did not have a great experience at another infiniti dealership.  She called back within 20' with an offer, we went in the next day and drove home our new car.  GREAT and exceptional service.  This dealership is highly recommended.",5.0

We live in Austin and were looking to buy the New Infiniti Jx. 
We contacted our local Austin Infiniti who told us that it would take about 12 weeeks for them to get us the car we wanted. 
So we contacted other dealers in Houston. 
Matt and Bethany from Sewell Infiniti found the car we wanted within an hour of us contacting them. 
Since the car was in some other state, they made sure that they contacted the dealer there and booked the car for us. 

They got the car within two days to their dealership in Houston. 
All this while they kept us updated of the status. It was a fantastic experience. 
We got the car we wanted within a week's time. 

Thank you Matt and Bethany, it was a great working with you.
 We got a good deal plus the customer service was excellent.
 Also thank you for the cookies that we received at home through mail.
 
We highly recommend Sewell Infiniti to anyone looking to buy a car.",5.0
18,"October 13, 2012","After going out to purchase a new 2013 Ford Escape Platinum for my wife to use as a company vehicle, we decided to take a look at a certified pre-owned Infiniti crossover for comparison and turned into Sewell Infiniti of North Houston. We were met by Rob Armstrong and from the moment he introduced himself, we were treated with the highest level of respect and decency we have ever experienced at an automobile dealership. After showing us a few options, we decided upon an FX35 that was in great shape for a pre-owned vehicle and within no time we were driving out with my wife's new company vehicle. Since that time, our experience with Sewell Infiniti of North Houston has been nothing but pleasurable. Rob even had us bring the vehicle back into the dealership when we discovered there was no front license plate bracket on it and he had one installed in minutes at no further cost to us. I was more than willing to purchase one, but his level of service and professionalism AFTER the sale was a validation of the way Sewell treats the new members of their family to the dealership.  We will definitely be purchasing from Sewell in the future.",4.8
19,"July 27, 2012","I live in Austin and I was trying to buy an used car from Sewell Infiniti (Houston location). I send a request via email and received a call from Kelly Harris. Each time, I tried to get in touch with Kelly Harris or was promised by Kelly to get an answer.. it takes a few phone calls or email to get in touch with her. I was ready to make a deal 2 weekends.. but each time, Kelly drop the ball and not returning my call for answer or for my offer. This is a very frustrating experience dealing with a dealership that pride itself in customer service (What customer service?). The crazy part is that I receive a canned follow up email from Mark Polites - Sewell Infiniti of North Houston and after I send him an email expressing my frustration.. I did not receive any response. 

Obviously, Sewell is too rich to make a sales and I and my money will just have to go else where. ",1.0
20,"March 11, 2012","This was the quickest and easiest purchase ever. From the moment we walked in we were treated with the utmost respect, customer service is certainly number one at this dealership. I had been searching for a used car and was becoming very discouraged after dealing with other local dealerships. Sewell Infiniti stands far above the  rest.  Go see them, you won't be disappointed.",5.0
21,"January 20, 2012","Rob was very helpful in locating my car and always returned my calls and emails promptly and answered all of my questions satisfactorily. I want to buy all my future cars from him! Alicia picked us up at the airport on the other side of town and brought us to the dealership. Everyone at there was friendly, courteous and made us feel at ease. This was the best experience I've had when purchasing a vehicle.",5.0
22,"September 22, 2011","Our experience with J.Michael and Sewell couldn't have been better unless they had just given us the car.  This is my first infiniti but hopefully not my last.  We will definitely return to Sewell.  When my husband was trying to negotiate deals with other infiniti dealers, they acted as if they wanted to keep their cars instead of sell them. I was beginning to think I wouldn't get an infiniti. However, when he found J. Michael, things changed. J. Michael was professional, ready, and willing.  He went above and beyond to make the sale.  We drove all the way from Baton Rougeto get the car thinking that there may be some bottom line ""extras"" once we got there, but there wasn't.  The paperwork was ready when we got there, and I drove away in my new car in about 30 minutes. We tell everyone about our experience.  Thanks for being worthwhile and having good salesmen like J. Michael.  ",5.0
23,"February 16, 2010","This was the best buying experience in 40 years of buying cars. I bought a used Mustang convertible, but they treated me as if I was buying the most expensive Infinity on the lot. When I got the car home, after a couple of weeks, I discovered the fog lights were fake. The dealership was horrified they missed it and installed Genuine Ford foglights at no charge to me. I was planning on having to do this myself an know that this was at least 500.00 they put out AFTER the car was sold and delivered. 
Their after sale followup was fantastic - any issue I might have had I feel certain would have been corrected - had I had any. Since they are on the Nort side of town about 30 miles from my house, they even FedExed my license plates to me.
For a dealership to go this distance with a used car, not of their brand, I feel speaks volumes about the dealers committment to excellence. I often see commercials talking about customer satisfaction, but these people actually put their money where their mouth was.",5.0
