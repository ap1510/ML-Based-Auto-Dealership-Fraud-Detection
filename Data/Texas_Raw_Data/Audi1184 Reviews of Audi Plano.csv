0,"June 08, 2020","Yomi Bokini, the first salesman I've ever had pleasure doing business with. NO hard sell tactics, no talking about how I was going to pay for the vehicle, no asking about monthly payments. He seem more interested in if I liked the vehicle during my test drive. He didn't babble on needlessly about all the features of the car. He told it to us straight, whenever we had questions and if he didn't know the answer, he would go and find out right then and there. Finance manager was pleasant as well, sure he tried to get us to to buy warranties and the like, but I kindly told him no thank you on all added items. Thats his job, to try and get the customer to buy add ons. When we told him no , he didn't take it personally or try to pressure us to buy.A week after the sale, still treat you like your a person and not just sale. Can't say enough good things about this dealership. Even gave us a free window tint, after buying the car",5.0

2,"May 31, 2020","Hunter. Hunter. Hunter. This gentleman is amazing. Every time I need service done on my S5 he has taking great care of me. I had a issue where I had to go get emergency service done on my car at another Audi location. Called Hunter (Service Manager) he put me in a car and assisted the other Audi location with my car. Not only does Hunter make you feel important he takes care of you like family. Hunter if you get to see this you made sure this Veteran (Army) will be a lifetime customer.  
Also there is a gentleman that handles finance sad I can't remember his name at the time. He has a love for Peru like I do. Everytime he always check to make sure I am taking care of also. ",5.0
3,"March 31, 2020","On Sunday traveling I started my trusty Audi and was greeted with a Check Engine and glow plug light. This concerned me so much that I thought it best to go to the nearest dealership. Sadly I chose this place. After a normal check in, the service stopped. I was notified that my previous warranty repair was broken and surely the other dealer must have done shoddy work. Six months ago and 10k miles ago. After refusing to warranty by the service manager I was sent on my way. I will have the warranty repair done at my normal dealership tomorrow with the same standard  of service I have always enjoyed. I will not ever return to or do business with this dealership nor recommend to anyone as the value of that 5 to 6 hundred dollar part was far more important to them than my health or satisfaction.

18,"November 26, 2019","Very bad dealership. Not happy with them at all.
I bought a car from them, the car had some damage in the hood and bumper. It was showing nothing in the CarFax report which was really strange.

Business usually run on trust, my biggest mistake was trusting them.

They made me test drive a different car claiming that my car would have the exact same feature, which it did not.
They made me wait for a month to get the car(told me it would take a week to fix it), made me sign the contract for the car before the car was fixed and also said that my 5 car trial period would start after my car was fixed and I get my car.
Since my car didn't have the feature it was promised, I went back to return the car and they said that my 5 day trial period started the day I signed the contract.

They are not giving me my down payment money and keep stalling me.
Even Up to today, it's been more than 3 weeks that I have asked for a refund, they keep stalling me saying they can do nothing.

This dealership is shady. I suggest you not to go there. 

This was the first car I was buying with hard-earned money, they just made it a really bad experience for me.",1.0

We decided to go to Audi Plano, because who wouldn’t love and Audi? Joe was the first person to help us and he was excellent! He’s very knowledgeable and confidently answered every question we had (there was a lot lol). He was not pushy whatsoever and sat patiently as my fiancé and I went back and forth about finances and such. Overall a great experience and will definitely be back to Audi Plano to see Joe! Btw he put us in a 2019 Audi A4 and we love it!!!",4.8

26,"April 09, 2019","Hi

I took my 2011 Audi A4 for a 55000 miles service.
Bill came up to 2000$. (Oil change, coolant, brake fluid)

I was over billed 300+$ for Tire-rotate and Wheel balancing (which was never done)
They promised a refund for Tire works that was never done.

But later realized that they cheated me, I never got my refund.

Please stay away from Audi-Plano-Service.

27,"March 31, 2019","Joe Peer was wonderful to deal with. I'm horrible with names, but there was a manager in training that assisted as Joe initially was helping another customer. The finance person was not pushy, friendly, and explained everything in detail. I'm so excited about my new car. The bad reviews are unfortunate, because my experience was nothing but great. Even the young woman working the counter was extremely helpful and nice the moment I entered the building. ",5.0
28,"February 17, 2019","My salesperson Luis was awesome! Thanks Neal for the writing instrument! Only 2 reasons for 3 stars. Without them, the rating would have been 1 star. I had to call and email the manager and finance team everyday for a week. All documents and bank documents were ready on my end and in their possession. I securedb own bank loan and maybe that irritated them. Unacceptable behavior for a car dealership. I was offered many apologies for their lack of professionalism. I was surprised that I wasn't offered any other incentives..didn't even get a key chain. 
 :(  Audi is very different from other brands. ",3.0

Joe Peer has COMPLETE knowledge of his cars and made us feel very comfortable.   My wife and I have been driving Mercedes products for over 30 years and to make a change was difficult.  Mr Peer let us drive a A6 Audi and then after carefully comparing different cars, we came back to purchase the A6 Audi from Joe Peer at Plano Audi. Great Experience!",5.0
30,"January 30, 2019","Worst Experience Ever!! 

Audi Plano has to be by far the most condescending and rude Finance Team there is. To be treated like I was not good enough or could not afford the vehicle was just outrageous. 

I went in today for my 2nd appointment to pick out the color and options to see what kind of negotiation we could do and instead we got disrespected and laughed at by Trey, the Director of Finance and Peter in Finance. 

Thank you to Neil, Marcio, and Danny for coming back and trying to recover from the damage the others did. Thank you for being respectful and apologizing for their horrible behavior, even when you did not do the insulting. 

It’s sad, you could’ve had my business had we not experienced that discrimination. We didn’t ask you to do us any favors, we just ask for you to be transparent with the numbers. You instead chose to be disrespectful and treat me like I could not afford it (I hv excellent credit and make great $) and you had already made your decision on if you were even going to try and sale this vehicle to me as soon as u walked up. Shame on you for your derogatory behavior, remarks, and your terrible manners.

If u want an Audi...do yourself a favor and go to a different one!! If you want to get laughed at, walked away from, and treated like garbage, go to Audi of Plano.

To the Finance Department, learn some manners!!!! ",1.0

He walked over our options and made us understand our options. Joe is a great team player and Audi is very lucky to have him 

Thanks Joe

33,"November 09, 2018","I shopped around at several dealerships as most car buyers do, and was exceptionally pleased by the service I received from salesman Joe Peer. He was very attentive to my needs and was incredibly knowledgeable about all of the features Audi has to offer. If i shopped at Audi Plano first, I might not have gone anywhere else. I love my Q5!",5.0
34,"September 12, 2018","I'm not quite sure why there are so many negative reviews about this location out there. I did read them and was admittedly hesitant to give them a chance, but I am certainly glad I did. My sales person Marcio Velasquez was the absolute best. I don't know how he did it and wasn't going to ask too many questions, but he was able to work the impossible for me on an '18 A4 with the negative in my previous vehicle and cash out of pocket and still get me in exactly what I wanted with the lease terms I was looking for. I was always well informed and was not treated simply as another number but rather a valued customer. I strongly recommend working with him if you're in the market for a new Audi and form your own opinion of this dealership. Everything was clear cut from start to finish, not to mention I was in to test, negotiate and through finance in about 3 hours. At the very least, Audi Plano is definitely worth considering if you're in the market for a new Audi. From start to finish this was the most smooth process I have ever experienced in my years of purchasing vehicles.",5.0

44,"March 22, 2018","We simply had a great experience in the car buying process at Audi Plano.  Joe helped us in understanding the different options of the various cars we were interested in.  He was super patient as we took our time to drive and figure out the exact configuration that we wanted. 

Audi Plano didn't have the color that I wanted, so Joe did some legwork, found exactly what I was looking for and had it brought to the dealership.  I travel quite a bit so the majority of our negotiation was over email and text, which worked great for me.  What i appreciate about Joe was his ability to adapt to whatever communication would work for me at the time.  (be it phone, text or email)  

After getting the car, there was a flaw in the tint, which Joe personally took care of.  Even to the extent of driving to my house to swap cars while they got it fixed.  

I have purchased new and used cars from some of the popular luxury car dealers around Dallas, and I would say that the service I have received so far from Audi Plano has matched or exceeded my previous experiences.  

If you are considering Audi Plano, you should feel confident in the choice.  And be sure to ask for Joe.  He will be honest and direct with you.  None of the games you normally get through the experience.   ",5.0
45,"March 17, 2018","I need to be sincere and transparent. It was my firs time in an Audi Dealership. The first approach was very disappointing.

But later while reviewing we got the exact features and the interiors were very much matched the way we looked for.. and the sales person handled it very well... by the time we decided to go for it.... and the sales person started working on paper work where we were thinking to work on different banks to work for better rates... a person showed up all of a sudden asking for deposit Cheque in a very hard way.. I got taken up back for a moment as there was no communication about the cheque and I said that we will give the next business day and another guy came all of a sudden shouting that "" so you are not going make a deal today?"" again hard view. 
There are many friends who has bought from Plano I have never heard same day giving deposit cheque..
And they were forcing to give the deposit cheque and start the paper work for finance which was weird and was got surprised... treatment was very bad and we as a family got very upset as we have spent so much of time irrespective of having guests waiting back in home.

62,"June 14, 2017","Leased a 2016 TTS from this dealership in December 2016 after a whirlwind of issues just getting the deal papered. I was informed that the car had hail damage but had since been repaired and that there was an open recall on the vehicle that needed to be taken care of before I could pick it up and that it would take about 10 days to finish making my delivery date December 18th. A few days before the delivery date I got a call from the dealership saying that the part they were replacing broke while they were installing it thus pushing the delivery date back further! Finally on December 23rd I drove from Kanas City to Plano to pick up the TTS. The morning i was supposed to be picking my car up from Audi Plano I got yet another call informing me that while replacing the part that they broke they also broke the back up camera and the driver side seat controls. They got the driver seat ""fixed"" before I got there to pick it up. Showed up signed my paperwork and left. When I got back to Kansas City I took the TTS to the car wash and thats when i realized the there were dents on the roof, swirls ALL OVER the paint (which on a black car sticks out like a sore thumb) there were chips on the black wheels and deep scratches in various places on the body of the car. I took my car to Molle Audi here in Kansas City to have the driver seat fixed and the black wheels refinished thats when i found out the wheels were painted by Audi Plano and that my warranty on them was VOID!!! Not to mention after fixing the seat they went ahead and did an estimate to fix the wheels and the swirls and scratches in the paint coming to roughly about $19,000.00 in damages between the paint the wheels they also found water damage in the head rests of the back seat rust and corrosion on both seat motors and the drive shaft was rusted! I emailed my sales person, the finance manger i dealt with and the GM and NOT ONE of them responded.

67,"April 19, 2017",I will never use this dealership again. My daughter wanted an audi when I purchased her car but I chose not to go back. They are slick dealers and drive up the price. Do not purchase a car from this dealership. They are unscrupulous in their business practices. ,1.0
68,"April 14, 2017","Ricky was great as my salesman, but the sales manager was involved in the purchase, and it was not pleasant.
First, I submitted my car as a trade-in and was told the price offered was from the central office- the dealership had nothing to do with the price. They offered me $5k less than CarMax. Unacceptable. They finally agreed to meet The CarMax offer, but they took my car because they were ""shipping it to their Mercedes Benz dealership in Houston, where they already had buyers."" Not true. My car is still sitting on their used car lot. Apparently they were afraid I'd back out of the deal so they made up that story.
I LOVE the Audi I purchased from them, but will NEVER return to the dealership for service. I'll drive the extra 30 miles and get my car serviced from a dealership with integrity.
I could go on and on about my car buying experience, particularly the poor communication, but I'll end with this- Shop around and buy from a dealership that has integrity. This one doesn't. ",1.3

Joe Peer was our point of contact, he greeted us and treated us as one of his highest priority customers. We felt extremely welcomed to Audi Plano.  Joe was great to work with and went above and beyond in more than one form, not only apologized for the vehicle selling too swift, he went out of his way to search and successfully located the same exact vehicle we were looking for, he located one with the best of both worlds outcome: the vehicle was low mileage and a fabulous price. 
We proceeded with the purchase without actually looking at the vehicle.  We totally appreciate Joe for assisting throughout the entire process and to “top it off” Audi Plano finance located a better APR financial entity for us. We could not be more pleased with the whole experience and the professionalism that we received from Joe and Audi Plano.

89,"June 04, 2016","I have owned Audi A4 for 12 years and got it serviced at Boardwalk Audi and the same advisors provided great service. Every time they suggested a big repair I got a second opinion and it matched and I started trusting them.Then the mgmt changed I believe.  In 2013 they suggested I sell my A4 for a new Audi and they will give Audi  Loyalty discount. They suggested I go and sell it with Carmax for better price. I did that and came back the next week to buy a Q5 and guess what ?? They told me I can not get Audi Loyalty discount anymore since I don't own an Audi any longer.
Another incident on my Q5 service ...
I took my car for service  last december ( Dec 2015 ) . They performed service and told me my brakes were OK. Around April 2016 my Q5 started  giving brake noise. I took my Q5 for state inspection at Audi Plano and after getting it inspected they told  me I need to replace all 4 brake pads for $1550 . I could not believe my brake pads were already gone. So I got my car back and checked with another Audi dealer for the price and I got the same $1500 quote but they mentioned that the odds of all 4 brakes needing replacement at the same time are very low. I did not want to drive far so I went back to Audi Plano mentally prepared to spend $1500 . I drove around 800 miles between those visits . Then I hear that since I did not replace the brakes when they suggested ( 800 miles back ) I need to replace my rotors as well and the total cost is now $2200. I realized something is very wrong and took my car back and drove to another Audi dealer . They looked at it for 90 minutes and came back and told me the brakes and rotors are both fine and they don't need replacement. In fact they told me the brake noise was related to recall on Q5 and fixed it for free . Now I am very disappointed with Audi Plano after being a  loyal customer for 16 years. I feel they tried to cheat me and worst part is that it was with the same advisor I worked with for last 16 years.",1.4

For Once, i had to write this review so that people be aware of this service center.

I left my A6 at this facility to get my windshield noise fixed without taking out any of my stuff off the car (mistake on my part) as it was supposed to be a short term repair. When i got back home, i was surprised to see my watch which went missing, a bunch of quarters under the arm rest (they left a couple in there) and a gift card (they took the gift card and left the empty pouch). 

I took this up with the service manager who was unable to find any clues with their limited Video surveillance and was sorry for whatever happened and can file a police complaint if i like and thats about it. My watch ( gift from my wife on our wedding) will never be recovered.

104,"June 04, 2015","I Purchased a 2015 Audi a3. Recently the RIM around of the car-charger-port went on me. It is supposed to illuminate. 
anyways, I stopped by around 4:30pm on a wednesday evening. I explained to the rep. about the issue. A mechanic took a quick look and tells me it's working. But apparently, he was checking the charger port instead of the RIM. the rep totally misinterpreted what I just explained. anyways, the mechanic says that it will take some time to fix. Mechanic left the scene. Now the Rep takes my # and says someone will call me for an appointment. Why couldn't you make an appointment on the spot? Why do I have to wait for a call to make an appointment?

The very next day I get a call from Audi Plano service dept. First thing she says "" Hello Mr. ABC, your car is ready to pick up!"" I was really irritated that I did not even drop my car. Finally, she made an appointment.

I bring my car. Sherry Parker is the service adviser. We talked about the issue and she had me waiting on the sitting area for a loaner car. after waiting around 45 minutes when I went and asked for the status..she totally forgot about me. Then she managed a loaner which is really filthy , stinky. I hopped in to the loaner and there were two empty starbucks bottle on the front row and one empty Yahoo Milkshake bottle in the back seat. the whole car smells like raw fish. Apparently they did not detail the car.

So I have the loaner now...day1 passes by...day 2 passes bay...on day 3 I called for a status. Sherry doesn't have a business card or direct number. I had to call the main line and ask for her. and I always left VM and then she called me saying that it needs a part that will be procured from Germany and will take 3 weeks.

I picked up my car. Again, i never heard from them and I had to call the main number again on 4th week. So n So says that your part is already here and transferred me to Sherry. They first thing Sherry says when is a good time to drop by. I was upset that i had to call everytime for a status. so we made an appointment for saturday noon.

Friday I get an email from Audi that my appointment is all set for 2pm. I had to call the main number again and told them we agreed for 12pm not 2pm.

anyways, I showed up on saturday noon and Sherry says so you engine has a loud noise? I was like totally frustrated and told her that it's the RIM of the car-charger-port that does not illuminate anymore. She is totally clueless. then I have to explain again and she recalled her memories. 

She says it will take an hour and if I wanted to wait. I asked for a loaner so that I could grab my lunch in between. 

Guess what? she never called me . when i called the Main number again around 5pm or so as I did not receive any phone calls, the main receptionist says that service dept. is already close. My work ID is in my car. and now I can't get it until monday.

Monday I called twice (again the Main number). Everytime I call, receptionist says they are busy if I like to leave my number and Sherry will update. then I emailed Sherry as well for an update. no response.

Tuesday I just showed up at the front desk and did not even talk to Sherry. picked up my car. Upon signing off the papers at the front desk; the lady gave me a survey. As I was filling that out , Sherry shows up and says why am I giving her negative review. I did not bother to explain. just picked the car and left the dealership!

I had cars from BMW, Lexus , Acura and Infiniti.  This dealership is no where near to the others as far as services.

109,"September 28, 2014","Ever Since Auto Nation purchased what used to be a great Audi dealership, this is the worst experience I have ever dealt with in the 17-20 cars I and my family have purchased in the past 16 years.
My oldest daughter was told my her sales person he had a fully loaded 2015 A4 that she could trade her car for and have zero money down and a payment that was about $75 higher then her current payment. When she arrived to sign for her new car, the car she was promised she was now told wasn't available, so she was shown a basic A4 with no special features and the payment she was promised went up by $277.  That's lying and bait and switch.

I then went in to try to lease a Q7, was told we can't get you in the Q7, but because of all the incentives we CAN do the A8.  So I agreed to go with the A8.  I asked the Sales person and Finance person if this was a DONE deal, they said it was absolutely an approved deal and my car had already been taken to the back and was being detailed for me.  When I pushed for a time to come get my car, I was informed that NO, we can't get you that car.  NO INTEGRITY and LYING.

So next, my youngest daughter who currently drives a 2013 A5 was contacted by our Sales person Ricky ()he contacted her without any requests by her at all).  Ricky told my daughter he had a loaded 2016 A5 that he could get her into with ZERO money and down and wouldn't change her payment a cent.  So he peaked her interest and asked me about it.  I told RIcky I wanted to see the specs of the A5 and final payment terms.  It took a few days, but when I finally got the details of the A5 it was a s tripped down version with less features then her current car.  I told him, you said it was more features then she currently had.  So he said ok and got me the A5 with features comparable to what she currently has, but then said he needed cash down and a higher payment.  I argued that you initiated this deal and promised her a better A5 with zero down and exact same payment.  He also got the Finance Manager involved and he told me he would make it happen, but again after several days 1) they kept trying to go around me and talk to my daughter directly thinking they could take advantage of a younger girl.  But my daughter was smarter then them and kept forwarding Text messages and phone calls to me.  After I told them directly DO NOT contact my daughter direct they continued to do so.   Trying to con her into m ore money for a vehicle with less features then she has now.

So now you have Lying, Bait and Switch as well and bullying a young girl for money and putting her into a payment she couldn't afford.

Just to finish this up, the Sales Manager Jeremy and Finance Manager Philip couldn't figure out why I was upset and were confused as to why we thought this dealership was lying, fraudulent in practicing bait and switch and worst of all trying to bully a young girl.

They are so bad, they are also hiding their names from this dealership, most all of the names below no longer even work there and most of the people that I dealt with are not even listed below.

110,"September 08, 2014","I bought four (4) new tires from DFW Audi and was told that for the first year, there is a 100% coverage/replacement if anything should go wrong with the tire. Low and behold,my son ran over a nail going through a construction zone and Plano Audi was the closest dealership.    He wasn't wanting to drive back through traffic, etc on a donut so he took the tire in and left it with the dealership.

When he got the call the next day, we were told that the charge to replace the tire that was under 100% warranty (FYI- the tire didn't even have 5,000 miles on it yet) was $70 and change.  When he asked why, he was told we were responsible for taxes, labor and the pro-rated cost of the tire.  Now, is where I got involved.  

I called and spoke to Randy in Service and was told that my son was given incorrect information, the tire is covered at 100% but the cost of the tire is $135 and I paid $163 per tire plus taxes and labor.  Now, I'm not opposed to paying the taxes and labor but I am opposed to paying a mark up that's on a tire that I should have bought elsewhere.  And when I asked where that additional $30 charge is going because we both know it wasn't going to the manufacturer, I was told ""I don't know ma'am, it's just the difference in the tire cost"". Not to mention that this is a tire I was just told was covered at 100% for the first year. Baloney, it may only $30 but I know I'm not the first person this has happened to and I won't be the last. I also mentioned that I could have bought tires any place else and the tire would have been replaced with zero cost to me. Randy's response ""I don't care ma'am"".  

Next time, I'll buy from another company and get the true 100% road coverage.  We've also decided against buying a new Audi A-5. Congratulations Audi of Plano, you just ruined the Audi experience!",1.0

Her actual response was ""We close in 15 minutes. Can I get you a brochure and a card? You can call on Monday"". I was shocked and walked out. I eventually went to the stores facebook page and was going to post there when I saw the very receptionist pic as ""liking"" the page. I just so happened to click on it and saw this post word for word: ""I hate how inconsiderate people are. It is so rude to show up to a car dealership right before or after close. Be considerate of all the employees that have been working all day and want to go home to enjoy our families."" I WAS SHOCKED!! Really?? The paying customer was rude to show up during business hours???? We should tailor our 60 hour week to fit into your schedule?? I never did get to drive an Audi. She made buying my new BMW (after closing time on a Saturday) a pleasure.

112,"July 22, 2014",Kenneth Fleeger is the person you want to ask for when purchasing your new/used Audi.  Kenneth was absolutely spectacular in this car buying experience. He was never pushy never rude was extremely patient and he had a unique and fun as hell personality. I have actually sold cars before in the past and I was so impressed by his customer service skills and his respectful non pushy selling technique.  Kenneth is so likable that you would want to have him in your circle of friends.  Audi Plano is VERY lucky to have Kenneth.  Audi Plano went beyond our expectations on discounted price of the  new car and trade in value for our old car. This dealership is currently under major construction so the sales office is in a mobile trailer but I was so impressed with how well organized there system while not having a dealership to operate out of.  I highly recommend Audi Plano. We actually bought our first Audi from Audi Dallas about 7 months ago and they failed in every category from sales to service. We are such low key people that nothing really rattles us but the experience from Audi Dallas really rattled us.

A friend of ours owns one and loves his so we decided to stop in and check it out. We loved our Lexus and really thought we would end up purchasing another one. 
      From the minute Richard approached us to the time we drove our Q5 home, it was a very different experience. The first thing that was evident was Richards knowledge of the vehicles. His knowledge went beyond the typical sales features that they all run by you when you are looking at a car. He explained real differences between makes of cars both good versus bad, depending on what you are looking for in a car. If you are looking for a luxury car, a sports car, etc. he told us what cars would fit our expectations and then left it to us to make the final decision. He simply gave us the facts and let us decide. We felt like he really did want us to be happy with our purchase. We knew that of course he wanted to sell a car, that is his job, but even after we purchased our car, he has been available to help us with what ever we have needed. We are so happy with this car, that we purchased another Audi from Richard. These cars are amazing and all I can tell you is buying a car from Richard and dealing with Mitch and their team has been a pleasant change. Drop by and check them out.

114,"April 27, 2014","My purchase of an Audi A4 was nothing short of an enjoyable experience.  I showed up at Audi Plano hoping to compare an Audi A4 to an Acura TL.  Sizing down from an SUV to a luxury car, I was looking for something sporty, comfortable and reliable.  I wanted to be able to show up at the soccer game with my two kids and pull into a valet in downtown Dallas all in one day.  

My dad and I met Richard quickly and he was honest, upfront and knowledgeable about why we should move forward with an Audi.  We struck up a cordial relationship and had a great afternoon.  I never once felt pressured into buying anything, more excited to be a part of the Audi family.  Within just a few hours, I knew I had to have the A4.  Unlike the Acura TL, the A4 felt safer, drove smoother and had a little more sass.  It was more than what I thought I could afford and better than I could have imagined. I walked away with a sense of empowerment for having bought such a beautiful, quality car within my budget constraints.  

Since the purchase of my car, I have received several calls from the Audi Plano dealership and from Richard, checking in on my experience.  I would feel completely comfortable calling and asking questions or dropping the car off for services because the ""hassle"" just isn't there.  I will be a lifelong Audi customer from now on.  Even my dad is looking to buy one now!  I can't say enough how happy I am that I bought this car.  It is BEAUTIFUL--love it!",5.0

Let me start by saying I live in Houston, tx and was purchasing a vehicle on a Friday planning to drive to Plano to pick up on a Saturday. This Dealership has unethical business practices that are just too terrible to ignore. The whole process what long hard and complicated. Then after everything is finalized they sold the Audi Q7 I had sent financing from my personal bank to secure ownership of out from underneath me. I got a text message hours after financing was secured that said ""sorry the vehicle had sold"" after the dealership was closed for the evening. No one would answer our calls to explain or really even apologize like an adult. This type if behavior is unacceptable for any business and extremely unethical.

123,"February 21, 2014","After a terrible experience at Central Audi in Houston, I decided to call Audi Plano to see if they had the car that I wanted.  Sheer luck, Rich answered the phone and was AMAZING from the very first interaction.  

Audi Plano sold the car that I wanted just days before, but Rich offered to LOCATE the vehicle that I wanted and have it SHIPPED to the dealership in Houston - essentially, giving up this sale so that I could have the car that I wanted (which was more than the dealership in Houston wanted to do for me).  Immediately, I decided that if someone was willing to go the extra mile to make my ""new-car buying experience"" what it should be - a short flight to Dallas was the least I could do.

I thought that living in a different city would be a challenge, but Rich took the time to phone and email me (at my convenience) to hear about the car that I WANTED to buy and not what some dealership wanted to sell.  Rich searched the state and the ports to find my car within days.  

Rich and Mitch were fair in the negotiations and we settled on a price over an email!  The transition to Chris in Financing was equally seamless.  Chris was super kind and took time out to talk to me about the different post purchase options.  I knew what my finance rate and payments would be - and it was super easy!!  They even sent a notary to Houston to complete the paper work!!

Rich's great service didn't stop at the signing.  Rich kept in constant communication with me all the way to my pick up day!  Rich even offered to fetch me from the airport.  

When I got to the dealership, Rich, Mitch, and Chris were welcoming and I got the ""white glove"" treatment from Rich during my vehicle orientation.  Rich's experience was obvious - the vehicle orientation was smooth and very clear.  I'm so glad he made me complete the speech recognition set up - because I certainly wouldn't have done it on my own!  As if everything he did wasn't enough, Rich loaded a few songs in my Jukebox for my return drive home to Houston!

I'm so glad that Rich answered the phone the day I called.  He and the Audi Plano team recovered my ""new-car"" buying experience!  I'm definitely an Audi Fan and if I ever need another car - Rich is my man!

However, my loyalty towards BMW started to wane after Audi released the new SQ5. I became a true convert when I went to Audi Plano to test drive the car and met Rich Gouhin, who allowed me to test drive the Q5 3.0T and then the SQ5 immediately afterwards so that I could determine which vehicle met my needs the most. Although I wasn’t ready to buy that day, the phenomenal customer service I received from Rich Gouhin and his manager Mitch, made me call him back as soon as I was ready to purchase the vehicle.

During the test drive, I let Rich know that I worked for a company that had the Friends & Family discount and I thought this would lessen the level of customer service I received. Rich pleasantly proved me wrong. He educated me on the differences of all of the models and patiently waited as I figured out what color I wanted.

Rich was very warm and personable and the short amount time that my husband and I had to wait to get into the Finance office made it seem like we were hanging out with a good friend.

137,"December 17, 2013","To Whom It May Concern:

I am writing this letter to express my grave disappointment with my customer service today at Audi of
Plano. I rarely take note when off things happen in my everyday dealings and quickly write them off as
someone having a bad day or just being busy. Today, however, was different because it was outright
unacceptable. I currently drive an Audi that I purchased at the Plano Dealership and was immediately
impressed with the Customer Service given to me there and it was a deciding factor in my purchasing
decision. I even prepaid for car maintenance so that I could keep up my new automobile as it is my pride
and joy! Today I drove to the dealership to get an oil change and immediately felt like my positive
experience was not going to extend over into the service department. After pulling up and sitting in my
car for 5-7 minutes being looked at by employees who walked by but never spoken to I began to feel
frustrated but I again wrote it off as busyness. I then was approached begrudgingly by an employee with
a simple head nod instead of a greeting, a “Hello, how may I help you?” would have sufficed or dare I
say “Happy Holidays, may I help you?” but I received neither. After I explained my need for an oil change
whenever available I was told that they would have to see if they could fit me in which was
understandable. The associate walked away and I watched him go to the back and speak with other
associates. He then returned and quickly said they were too busy and could not fit me in today at all at
ANY time. This puzzled me since it is 9am in the morning but I had no choice but to believe them
although I felt they were not trying their best to please the customer in this instance. I asked when
would be a good time and he gave me a card and said, “Call this number and schedule an appointment.”
I sat there bewildered for a moment because I am sitting at the dealership where I wanted service and
was told to call a number? Proper customer service etiquette would have been to apologize for not
being able to assist me today but try to fit me in the next available time slot while I was there so that my
trip would not have felt in vain. This made me wonder if I was being told the correct information and
also made me question their willingness to help me. I drove away afterwards with that nagging
suspicion on my mind. After getting to work I called a friend and asked her to call the service
department and see if they could fit her in today for an oil change. Unfortunately after my return call
from my friend my concerns were justified when she informed me that they told her to come in as soon
as she could. I was infuriated! I am a young African American male and I feel that I was sent away simply
because they did not want to assist me. I feel I was not addressed timely when I arrived, was not
addressed professionally upon approach, and was not treated with the customer service level that I
would expect from a dealership of this magnitude and reputation. I could have gotten any car that I
wanted, but I chose Audi because I believe in the brand but with that brand comes a level of
responsibility on everyone’s part who chooses to represent it, from the person answering the phones to
the person selling the cars. I am writing this not to simply complain, but as a reminder that everyone
deserves to be treated with respect and dignity. I will not be returning to that location for any of my
customer service needs and am seriously considering my future with the brand. I would hope that this
letter serves as a reminder that ALL customers should be treated equally and fair and that no one should
be made to feel like they are undeserving of superior customer service and basic common decency.

Sincerely,
William Ross

The dealership was very easy to work with and were very accommodating, ensuring that they could get our monthly payments to a number with which we were comfortable. Rich, our sales representative, was extremely knowledgeable. He did not pressure us to move forward with a sale but instead showed us the value of  purchasing Audi and then worked with us to develop an offer that we could not refuse. Mitch, the sales manager, was wonderful to work with as well. He was very fair with both of our trade-ins and made us feel valued as a customer. They were respectful, professional and did not play games. My husband and I had intended to spend the day test driving a number of vehicles. Although we planned to make a relatively quick decision, buying our two new cars within a week, we had no intention of buying them at the very first dealership we went to.

The Q7 is just wonderful...offers a big car without feeling like a big car. The quality surpasses other vehicles we considered, and we are still figuring out all of the new technology. Rich did a lovely job going over the features of the car, helping us connect our phones, etc, and offered to have us come back anytime for additional help.

One suggestion for Audi as they rethink future design....inside storage in the front of the care is substantially lacking - glove compartment/center console are very small (we can't even fit a sunglasses case in one of them). Also, the 2nd cup holder is a strange place with a cover as if used, it removed the armrest for the passenger.

142,"November 06, 2013","Buying a car is not an experience that I enjoy, even when I've had a lot of time to compare and price vehicles.  So, when I was recently involved in an accident that totaled my vehicle, I was very concerned that my need for a car would make me an easy target during the buying process.  However, fortunately I found a great car at a great price at Audi Plano, and was even luckier to meet Rich Gouhin.

Rich knew I was there to test drive a specific used Mazda and I was able to get right in and take a test drive.  After we got back to the dealership, I was very impressed with Rich's willingness to help me get the numbers to work out.  There were no repeat trips to ""talk to the manager"" or long stretches of time where I had to sit and wait.  I simply explained my situation and what price range I needed to stay in, and Rich just made it happen.  It really was that simple.  I never felt like I was being taken advantage of during this buying process, and I am truly grateful to Rich (and manager Jeff Hummel) for making me feel like a valued customer.  Audi Plano has many beautiful new cars that sell much higher than my used car, but Rich treated my sale with the same care and consideration as if I had spent much more.

He took us on a test drive in three separate models that eventually led to us being at the dealership well after the scheduled close of business.  He was very informative on the test drives and showed great respect in not bringing the hard sale as is customary in the industry.

It is important to note that even though we have an Audi dealership in our local market, we were willing to drive 3.5 hours to take delivery from Richard.  He is a great example of what we hope to experience when purchasing a vehicle and an asset to the dealership..  .",4.8
147,"October 12, 2013","My girlfriend and I stopped by to test drive some new TDI cars and fell in love with a 2014 Q5. Pricing was competitive, sales and finance were transparent, helpful, and gracious, we never felt deceived or misled, and once she made a decision, we were done and on the road within the hour.

We've already been back for a complimentary wash, bought accessories, and had the windows tinted. Everyone I dealt with was eager to help out and, in the case of the window tinting, understanding and accommodating of my admittedly unconventional request.

I called ahead and asked them to let her think she was getting the car washed so they could tint the windows, and they pulled it off in under an hour. She had no idea and was completely surprised by it.  It made her day, which made my day, and I never would have thought a car dealership would have been willing to go to those lengths for a regular guy like me.",5.0

149,"September 27, 2013","My husband I and recently visited Audi Plano, of course we were 'just looking'.  Kim made our experience so inviting and comfortable to do business, as well as being so thorough when reviewing the features of the Q5 we just couldn't imagine ourselves in another car or dealership!  The customer service at this dealership was by far the best we have ever experienced in our 20+ years of car buying.  My husband typically dislikes the experience in the finance office, fearing pushy sales etc.  Kim assured us we were in good hands when he placed us in Dawn Searcy's office - and boy was he ever right!  Dawn was very gracious and easy to understand, she completely explained our manufacture warranty, and our options.  She went over everything, every document, all of our questions, gave us all the information we needed to choose the best option that fit our needs - she wasn't pushy at all.  I felt like we had bought a car from people we were friends with through the whole process.  Dawn made it easy to find the items we would need when we call our insurance company, made sure we were comfortable by bringing us water, and did it all in 35 minutes!  The quickest most thorough time I have ever had in the finance office when purchasing a car!!!  The finance Director stepped in the say hello and congratulate us, his name was Greg, and also very nice and professional!",5.0
150,"September 23, 2013","I recently purchased a 2014 Audi TT from Audi of Plano. I had been considering a TT for more than a year but had never been in to visit a dealership. We visited a couple of Audi dealerships in the area and our experiences at the two dealerships were so different. We were immediately greeted on entering Audi of Plano and we always felt like there was someone available to help us. I never felt intimidated. After meeting Corstiaan, I understand why the atmosphere is so friendly. He seems to be a great general manager who is friendly and down to earth. He was able to save for me the one TT that came in that weekend so I didn't have to worry I'd lose it.

I was referred to both Corstiaan and Richard through a mutual acquaintance. I was very happy to be able to work with Rich. He is such a friendly and charismatic person. My husband and I enjoyed meeting him and working with him to purchase my TT. My husband had found that there was one TT coupe coming in and so we knew what color it would be. Rich called and encouraged me to come in and check it out the day it came in. I was hesitant because I was thinking about another car (not an Audi) that I was interested in, but I'm so glad I went in that Saturday. I got to help Rich uncover the car and the second I saw it, I knew I wanted it. He let me spend all the time I wanted with the car. I appreciated that he did not try to overly sell me on it. He also seemed to genuinely care that I understood everything about the car so that I could appreciate it fully. The test drive with him was so much fun because he encouraged me to really test out what the TT could do. Rich was so easy to work with that I feel like other people should learn from him. It made the whole process so much easier. 

Once we came in for the paperwork and to finalize the deal, both Jeff and Rich were terrific. They were both so friendly and helpful. They helped my trade in go so smoothly. Jose was also very easy to work with for all of the financial paperwork. All in all it was a great experience. Rich has kept in touch with me over the past few weeks that I have had the car and I appreciate that. Even though there is another Audi dealership closer to my home, I will be making the trip over to Audi Plano for any service needs and questions that I have. I feel quite at home there.",5.0
151,"September 15, 2013","After visiting another Audi dealership and not being too happy with the service I received, I went in to Audi Plano looking to talk about a potential trade in on my TT, I was greeted promptly and was set up with Rich. He was very friendly, knowledgeable and I didn't feel ""pressured"". I told him what I was looking for (A5) and we went on two test drives of the cars that matched my description. I liked the cars, however I wasn't sure. Rich never once tried to pressure me and he made it known that if I had any questions he was willing to speak with me. I left that day and returned 2 days later. Rich was available to work with me as soon as he finished up with another client, once again we test drove the vehicle but I still wasn't sure. He allowed me to take the car home to decide and think about it. I decided that I did not want the A5 and returned it 2 days later. I spoke with Mitch and Rich who both assured me that they were there and willing to assist me, but that ultimately it was my decision and they'd do whatever it took to make sure I was happy. I thought about it over a few days and decided that the Q5 was what I wanted, I contacted Rich and he told me to come by the dealership to show me what they had. Every time I came to the dealership I was greeted by Mitch and or Rich and if they were with another customer they would let me know immediately that they would be with me shortly. I test drove the Q5 and fell in love with it, it was the one. Rich and Mitch worked with the numbers to make sure that I was satisfied and got an even better rate/monthly payment than I requested on a 2014 and gave me a great amount for my trade. Who wouldn't love that? I also had some other obstacles as I am a traveler and have a different residence but they were able to find a way for everything to work out. I appreciated the fact that they were both very professional, friendly, patient and never once did I feel pressured, I honestly felt like they were truly there to make me happy and I greatly enjoyed working with them both. The day I purchased my vehicle Rich even ordered me Jimmy John's because I was starving seeming as I came straight from work. After signing all the papers, it was clearly way passed closing time but Rich stayed behind to make sure everything was good with my car, that it was cleaned in and out and gave me a small tutorial of all the features. He told me that I could stop by or call anytime if I ever had any further questions. Overall I had a wonderful experience and would recommend for anyone to purchase a vehicle from this dealership and particularly to work with Mitch and Rich. ",4.6
152,"September 03, 2013","Richard Gouhln and Mitch Henson provided exceptional customer service. From start to finish and soon thereafter, they went above and beyond to ensure my complete satisfaction and covenience. On the other hand, however, my experience with the finance manager, Dawn Searcy, was absolutely horrid! Not only was she very unfriendly, but she also had very little product knowledge when selling me the extra care packages for my A6. She literally rushed me through the entire signing process, and outright expressed her frustration whenever I asked her a question. I would write more, but that would require way too much time (more time than I would like to spend on her). ",5.0

I will continue my search elsewhere. By far the worse customer service. Since they didnt get me in the store to crunch numbers and keep you there for hours they toss me to the side on the side of the road. I dislike when sales people assume you have no money. Such a shame. I will make my purchase elsewhere.

157,"July 06, 2013","Pros: Service is fabulous and the advisors are great! I'm always able to get my car in when I want, even if I call and say I want to bring it in immediately. Andrew is always willing to answer a million questions about my car and he actively tries to save me money where possible. They always have a loaner available for free, so I don't have to wait around.

Cons: You seem to be tied to one advisor once you start going there, so vehicle drop off, pick up, and status updates seem to only happen when they're working. Hasn't been an issue for me yet, but I could see this bothering someone who isn't willing to wait a day. It's still an Audi dealership, so the prices are still high. The process to get a loaner takes a little longer than I'd like; I wish they'd save my information so I don't have to show them again each time.",4.6

He was very friendly, never pushy and very patient with all my questions. As I wanted one of the first 2014, Richard made sure my special order was one of the first to be placed with at Audi Germany once the production slots opened up.

She not only continuously followed-up with me, but when I told her I liked everything but the price (and again I sent a similar note to the others simultaneously), as everyone was above my target price, she got Jose to call me 1st thing in the morning and we agreed to the price, and lo behold, I walked into the dealership the next day to pick up the car.

Guess what, while we were doing the paper work, 2 cars got sold in front of me, and it looked like I would not get a car that day. However, Debbie left us in the safe hands of Jose, and by the time we finished the paperwork, Debbie was back with the news that she just got a car that rolled off the truck, and it was getting ready for us to take home.

And finally, the time & effort she took to get my son (for whom I bought this) trained on all the hi-tech features was simply awesome.

They set the standards of professionalism higher than any dealership I have previously worked with. I have honestly never had anything less than the best experience with this store. I was immediately greeted by a sales manager, Jeff Hummel, who was incredibly friendly and knew just how to calm my nerves and lower any defenses I may have had walking into the store. He immediately offered me a beverage and gave me a tour of the facility showing me important areas of the dealership. He never pointed me in the direction of something, he accompanied me to the necessary area. He was absolutely outstanding. I couldn't believe a sales manager was so accommodating and readily accessible, there was no hesitation in his approach.  This gentleman exudes genuineness and professionalism. He immediately connected me with a sales person, Debbie McNeilly, who was absolutely wonderful! She is one of the friendliest people I have ever met. She listened to all of the most important needs I expressed and paid attention to even the most minor details. She took the time to walk through every detail with me, educating me on things I was unfamiliar with. She never made me feel rushed, or silly, as a matter of fact, I felt such a connection, it seemed as though I was a guest in her home, SO accommodating. She has maintained this even after the car buying experience, and has made me feel like so much more than just a number. Furthermore, Mitch Henson introduced himself and spoke to me further about the details of the process as I asked Debbie to speak with a sales manager to meet someone ""behind the scenes"". He was such a warm, friendly gentleman who made me feel even more at ease about the whole process. Mitch, like everyone else at Audi went above and beyond to make this car buying experience one of a kind! He also spent plenty of time going over things in detail which was helpful as my husband was not here for this experience and I didn't ever feel as though I was doing it alone, thanks to Mitch! He knew the right combination of what was important and how to reach this place, and shared ony the necessary information which made this experience exceptional-as my time is precious! At one point Mitch had to step away, and when he did so, he asked Jose Herrera to continue explaining some of the process to me. Jose was such a delight to work with as well! His personality was incredible and you could definitely tell he is extremely passionate about what he does with Audi. He was extremely knowledgable, and much like all of the staff, he went above and beyond any client's expectations! I felt as though I had known him forever. Lastly, Jose introduced me to Jeannette Sandin who completed the process. She was amazing, what a great end to a wonderful experience. She was incredibly down to earth and very knowledgeable. I didn't feel pressured or uncomfortable at any point with her. couldnt have asked for a better finance experience. Ultimately, I would like to say that Audi has a phenomenal team working at this dealership and they should all be recognized for their tremendous efforts. I have never experienced such an incredible, painless, and smooth car buying experience. These folks have this process 100% streamlined. Way to go Jeff Hummel, Debbie McNeilly, Mitch Henson, Jose Herrera, and Jeannette Sandin, you guys were phenomenal. I will continue to refer all family and friends to this store, as I have no doubt they will be taken care of. ",5.0

There were specific features that I knew I did and didn't want on my A4 and Craig worked with me since before my move to find cars that could match. He found a car in Colorado that was exactly what I wanted and when it sold right before I was to buy it, he got me a great deal on another A4 in his lot in Plano. I took it for a test drive and drove it off the lot that evening. Before leaving, I noticed a few scratches from them removing the car cover and he had me back to the dealership and got them removed. Craig also mailed me the front license plate holder when I realized they sold me the car without it already on for the state of Texas. 
I've had my manual Premium Plus A4 for two months now and I'm loving it! I'm very happy with the way things worked out. Thank you Craig and Boardwalk Audi! ",4.8

273,"January 09, 2013","My experience with Ricky Reed was great. He did an outstanding job explaining the features of the CPO A5 I purchased. His personal approach was not pushy, but he was confident and patient. I especially liked how he was able to accomodate my needs when he expressed it to his sales manager. And the sales management team was also accomodating.

Although we ran into a snag during the negotiation process, the General Manager has personally committed to fixing. That is top notch service and I am very pleased with their attention to customer satisfaction. I feel like Boardwalk is going an extra step to keep my business, and believe it is a great gesture. 

I would highly recommend them to all, especially women who will go through the car-buying process alone. They were honest and fair.

274,"January 08, 2013","This is the second vehicle we have purchased from Boardwalk Audi.  Richard Gouhin helped us navigate both purchases.  (Last December an A7, this December, a Q7) Richard has achieved the right balance of communicating sincere interest in meeting your needs, but he does so without becoming overly aggressive.  Whether I was bringing in our first Audi for service, or shopping for our recent purchase, Richard always had time to help assist me with whatever my needs were.  He has a great balance of professionalism and sincere, friendly interaction in addition to possessing great knowledge of the Audi line.  We would most definitely send a friend to Richard, and will go back to him again with any future Audi purchases.  


I would also like to highlight Jeff Hummel.  He is such a delight.  More times than not, our two young boys are with us when we go to the dealership.  Jeff - without exception - always takes time to visit with them, and make them feel comfortable and welcome in the dealership.  I don't think it can be overstated how much it means to a parent to see someone else take an interest in, and care for your children.  So Jeff - thank you so very much for taking time to invest in my sons.  They look for you when we drop in because they know you will have time for them.  Thanks Jeff!  It means so much to us.

I would assume they are. I got a car without a complete set of floormats - which is so cheeky to me and when I called it out to my salesman - no response other than That's weird.

He was intent on ensuring that everything went swimmingly well for me in my researching and buying experience. Thank you, Rich!

I closed the details of my deal with Mitch, and he was great as well.  We scoped out a number of viable options to ensure that I was pleased with the deal relative to what I'd already been offered by other dealerships, and Mitch was also very patient in answering my litany of questions.

Once I was ready to discuss pricing, Rich and Mitch worked with me to make sure that I receive the best pricing and was comfortable with my purchase. What I appreciated most was the transparency that these guys displayed. They were honest, direct and fair, which is something that I did not receive at Goodson Acura.

287,"December 30, 2012","Boardwalk Audi of Plano Texas did not just sell me an amazing machine in my 2012 Audi S4. At Boardwalk they also provided me with an amazing first time Audi buying experience.
 
I knew it was time to trade in my 50th Year Anniversary Corvette Z06 and step into an automobile with luxury, maturity, comfort, and class. I had previously driven models from Lexus, Mercedes, BMW and so forth but never an Audi. 

The Audi S4 was on my short list of cars that met my requirements so I made my way into Boardwalk to get a closer look. As I have had my fair share of notable experiences at dealerships, I braced for the worst. The worst never came. I walked the lot appreciating the beautiful automobiles without a salesperson waving me down.

Once I was ready, I walked onto the showroom floor and asked for a salesperson. 
Richard Gouhin was the sales representative I met. As I asked questions about Audi, I got the distinct feeling that this was not just a job for Richard. This was a career, a passion, and perhaps a calling. Richard told me stories of his own Audi driving experiences and even showed me his personal A6.

I asked to see the S4s that fit my requirements and off we went on a test drive. To be honest the car outclassed my driving knowledge and skills but Richard was there talking me through the abilities and behavior of this marvel of German engineering.
When I returned home, I told my wife that I had just drove a machine that made me feel as if it was made for me.

I spoke to Richard a few times over the week about Audi’s automobiles. The conversations were pleasant and without pressure.

As I drove home from work on Friday December 28th 2012 I called Richard to see if he was in the mood to sell me a car.

I braced myself for the gut wrenching experience of car buying haggling. The bad of it never came. The numbers were good on the trade in, the financing, and price of the Audi. They even got a bit better as I spent some time talking to Richard and the Sales Manager at Boardwalk Audi, Mitch Henson. Let us be honest, the numbers started very respectable and I figured if I could get them to be any more handsome I was doing great.

So many times, I have left dealerships feeling like I could have done better or got taken for a ride but not this time. With Richard and Mitch, buying my Audi S4 felt like I purchased the perfect automobile while hanging out with great gentlemen. They provided me with a positive and memorable experience.
 
I now call Richard my Auto Sales Consultant. He is responsible for my transition out of the world of toys and into serious and well-engineered automobiles.
 
Thank you Boardwalk Audi, all of your employees, Mitch, and especially Richard.
 
Thank you for bringing me into the fold of Audi drivers… or should I say Audi lovers.

He was very kind and helpful but unfortunately it appeared that the car had already been sold.  We continued to shop around and 30 minutes or so later I got a call from Rich.  He said that it turned out it was still available.  It meant a lot to me that he took the time to call me back.  If he wouldn't have, I would've never known the difference but because he did my wife and I were able to get the car we wanted.  We showed up at the dealership and Rich made us first-timers feel right at home.

I had previously spent thousands of dollars at Audi Dallas only to have my car experience the exact same problems 3 months later. I had my car towed to Boardwalk Audi in hopes that they may do a better job. To put it simply, my expectations were beyond exceeded. Not only did they personally deliver a loaner car to me all the way in Dallas (they are located in Plano, a good 20 minutes away), they kept in constant contact with me the entire time. The best part was that they not only fixed the mistakes the other dealership made, but they also went to the trouble of contacting the regional director of Audi to ensure that I wouldn't have to pay for the same problem to be fixed twice. When I went to pick up my car, I was greeted by three smiling gentlemen who helped me out of the car as if I was royalty. I was offered coffee, tea, anything I so desired; the check-out process was quick, and I got to meet the fabulous team who I had been in contact with while my car was being repaired. I was reunited with my car and back on the road within minutes. I cannot express how thankful and impressed I am with such a wonderful dealership. They made what could have been a stressful experience a positive one; such a great way to start the holidays! I have seriously considered baking them a giant batch of cookies to express my appreciation.

320,"December 17, 2012","I reasearched all cars in the Luxury Sedan class and ended up choosing the Audi A6. I shopped competing dealers and competing brands. The reason I purchased my Audi from Boardwalk is due to the dealer convenience (right off tollway) pricing(honored my supplier pricing from employer), flexibility of lease vs. finance, and the customer service from the sales staff. My Sales Associate Alex Feller was recommended to me by another customer as I was walking in the store for a test drive. Alex listened to everything I wanted and searched their inventory locally and nationally to find what I wanted by color and options. At the end of the day, they had what I wanted in a shipment that just arrived. I liked the A6, but I needed to spend more time in the car, so he arranged a half day test drive for me. This really helped me feel confident about my decision. When I was ready to purchase, Alex introduced me to both managers - Mitch & Jose, which then worked with us to answer any questions about leasing vs. financing. My trade in wasn't quoted as much as it had been elsewhere, but Mitch worked with me to make the price of the sale and trade in worth moving forward. I worked with Jeanette in the finance department and she was very helpful in explaining all of the steps along the way. I did have some difficulty with the difference in documents between sales and finance because they use different systems. Jeanette and the finance manager helped work through all the explanations though and I felt comfortable at the end.

I met Jared Mikeska for the first time and he was beyond awesome. He called me everyday to give me an update on my A-4 Cab. Returned all my calls immediately and actually made me laugh at times. No visit to Boardwalk would be complete if Alex Feller wasn't there. Although he moved into sales his smiling face and assurance that all will be well is a very welcome site! No doubt I will purchase my next vehicle from Alex. I have nothing but respect for him. I also met a young gentleman by the name of Robert (porter).

370,"November 07, 2012","Our experience with Boardwalk was quite surprising. For a dealer that deals exclusively with VW - Audi and Porsche by each other, they demonstrated sub par knowledge of their cars and customer service. 
For e.g. 
1. Not knowing what drive select is and if they had cars that had this option in inventory 
2. Not letting me know of the tmobile 7 day activation special 
3. Not knowing what ad Audi was running in regards to lease on their website
4. Not even being present when I came in later on his request to help with the tmobile activation. 
5. The lady at the front desk was so busy on her phone call that when asked for the manager Jose - she said he was not in, but he happened to be sitting right in his office.

He provided follow up calls and not in an overwhelming or pushy way. We went to Audi that Monday, met Craig and discussed price and we bought a vehicle.

498,"August 15, 2012","I would buy a new car from a dealership primarily because of relationships.  I left Park Place for that reason!  I like the whole Boardwalk Audi dealership a whole lot, but especially I would buy a car JUST because of David; as long as he is my service adviser!

499,"August 15, 2012","I was in the market for a new car and narrowed it down to the 2010 Audi A4.  I had compiled a list of 10 dealerships or so to visit over the next couple of weeks.  Boardwalk Audi was my first stop and my last.  Craig Entis showed me the exact car online and took it for a test drive.  The car was in excellent condition and was covered under their 100k mile warranty.  Boardwalk Audi gave me a reasonable trade-in value for my 2005 Volvo S40 T5.  

This was my third car purchase and by far the best experience i've had.  Craig was not pushy at all, asked what I was looking for in a car price, trade in value and loan interest rate - all in all he was able to get exactly what I wanted.  I am very satisfied with my car and the car purchasing experience overall.  I would recommend Boardwalk Audi to anyone in the market for an Audi.

Ask for Craig Entis.

505,"August 13, 2012","The first visit to the dealership set the wheels in motion (pun intended I guess) for ultimately leasing a car at there.  Great first impression... and 2nd and 3rd...

I had never been to any of the Boardwalk dealerships before as they're not the closest Audi place to us but we'd heard good things so I wanted to check 'em out.  Immediately after walking into the showroom the experience was different.  They've created a very relaxed atmosphere with plenty of people around to answer my questions.  I wasn't followed around the showroom floor like a suspect nor was stalked like prey!  Just casually dressed sales and customer service folks walking around helping.  I'd gone in eager to see the new 2013 Allroad but learned that they'd not received any yet and that if I wanted to order one, it would arrive in about 90 days.  The timeframe was right and being the early adopter I am, ordering one was OK with me!  The General Manager introduced himself and shared what was known about the yet unseen Allroad.  Corstiaan was as enthusiastic as I was about the new model but since little was known about the car, ordering was a bit of an adventurer but he assured me that if the car wasn't what I expected, he would be happy to have it in his inventory.  Enough said.  Ordered the car and marked my calendar!

The next contact came by way of an email from Corey letting me know he'd be taking care of me moving forward - just a nice letter of introduction with the promise to keep me informed on the progress.  A couple delivery updates letter and I received notification that the car was at the dealership waiting for me.  I was out of town at the time but Corey assured me there was no hurry and to swing by when I got back.  For me, this was another great example of how professional they are in that there was no pressure to get to the dealership to ""close a sale"" - rather a very relaxed approach, understanding that just as we waited for the car to be built, they could wait until I was in town to wrap things up.

About a week later I called saying I'd swing by the next morning.  Corey met me as I pulled up, quickly made some notes about our trade-in and then walked me into a private area where the Allroad was prep'd and ready to be demonstrated.  After reviewing the features of the car, he asked if I wanted to drive it before beginning the paperwork.  I appreciated his offer, letting me know that the sale was not a given until I drove the car and gave it the thumbs up.  The car was in fact everything I expected and more so we moved on to options and terms.  

I decided on a lease and in less than two hours, I was driving away in the Allroad with the payments we wanted and great terms.  They gave us what we expected for our trade-in and made the entire process easy and maybe even enjoyable - with no haggling over price, interest rates etc.  From the initial visit through to delivery of our new car, my experience with Boardwalk and everyone we dealt with was friendly, professional and surprisingly fun.  We will absolutely work with them again!",5.0

520,"August 06, 2012","I looked for many months for a vehicle before I purchased my car.  In those months I decided that, no matter what, I was not going into a dealership.  The people that I spoke with, met or tried to talk with were rude, uncaring and at times belittling.  But that all changed the day I called Boardwalk and Ricky Reed picked up the phone and took my call.  I told Ricky that I had seen a Lexus online and wanted to know if they still had it in stock.  After kindly confirming that it was, we made arrangements for a test drive that evening.  Upon arriving to the dealership, Ricky had the car pulled up and waiting for my arrival. He greeted me by name like I was an old friend.  It was obvious that I liked the car, but I had a lot of hesitation going from an SUV to a car.  There was no sales pitch or pressure from Ricky to purchase the car while we test drove it, he just let me enjoy the car while answering any questions that I had.  Within just a few miles I told him that I would take it.  After getting back to the dealership and agreeing upon a price that I was comfortable with, along with a few items that I was requesting be done to the vehicle, the paperwork was done in no time at all.  Although there was a small wait to wrap up the financing, it was actually quite enjoyable.  Different members of the Boardwalk team stopped by to say hello and to make sure I didn’t need anything.  One of the guys even helped me score a great point with Words with Friends.  The comradery at Boardwalk was incredible.  It seemed like there wasn’t a stranger to be had and everyone was so pleasant.  

Since I asked for a few things to be done on car, it took a few days before I picked up the vehicle.  However, that was even a delightful experience.  Boardwalk not only made sure that the work was done by a Lexus professional, Ricky arranged for me to have a vehicle to drive and he brought the vehicle to me.  During those few days, he kept in touch with me making sure I was aware of the progress of my car.  The customer service I received was fantastic.  I didn’t purchase a brand new Lexus or a brand new Audi; I purchased a 2008 Lexus IS 250 from an Audi dealership.  I can buy a vehicle anyplace, but because of the fantastic customer service received from Ricky Reed, Mitch Henson and the rest of Boardwalk team, my guess is that the next vehicle we purchase might just be an Audi!

He has been nothing but a pleasure to work with on multiple kinds of service.  Running around the state with three offices, it is so important to me to have a professional for support on the car.  In particular, recently I needed an additional key made and David went overboard to make sure that it was an easy process for me.  I know I can trust David and always look forward to going back.  I'm in sales, and he gets a 10 in my book.

523,"August 02, 2012","  My experience with everyone at Boardwalk Audi was unexpected and delightful.  I have purchased several luxury cars from Lexus and Mercedes so I have become accustomed to great car buying experiences.  I wasn’t expecting the ""red carpet"" treatment I got from Debbie and her sales Manager Jeff Hummel.  I am very busy and they kept that in mind from the 15 minutes test drive to the 20 minutes in the finance office it was the fastest and best experience I have had.  While there I was also introduced to the whole new car sales management team so should Debbie or Jeff be off on a day I come in I have other people to contact.  
 Debbie is extremely knowledgeable about the Audi product line and walked me through all the bells and whistles on my new A5 with ease.  She also was very patience as I learned how to use the voice commands and she even loaded and connected my I phone with all contacts.   This detail my seem minute but in both of the previous luxury cars I have purchased this was never done.  She took four extra steps past what I was expecting and I greatly appreciate the time she spent getting my new audi up to speed.  

Jeff Hummel really went above and beyond on all process and had all my paperwork ready for me when I arrived.  I went straight back to the finance office and was out in 20 minutes which never happens.  I was not pressured or bothered while I took the two weeks to research and explore my new car options.  Jeff and Debbie were very responsive via email and phone and I always got a phone call back within the hour with all my silly questions or concerns.  I appreciated that as I have very limited time in my day to take care of personal matters.
I look forward to my experiences with Audi as this is my first Audi purchase.  I also want to Thank Jeff and Debbie and the whole Boardwalk team for all their hard work and due diligence. Jeff and Debbie have made me an Audi customer for life :)

531,"July 30, 2012","My experience with Audi Boardwalk has been exceptional.  It started with the sales experience and has continued with dealership support for car maintenance and automotive care.

I found Richard Gouhin to engage me on a personal level.  This approach removed all stress and pressure during the car buying experience.  Richard has gone far and above as he contacted me regularly to schedule and follow-up on a couple of items that were part of the car deal.  These were simple requests for support in getting another set of auto keys and to resolve a small crack in my windshield.  By my own admittance, I can be difficult to reach and to return calls.  It would have been easy for Richard to move along, but he showed commitment to ensure these items were addressed.  I would recommend friends and family to Richard knowing they were in good hands in getting a quality car at a fair market value or better.  I also feel very comfortable to visit Richard when I come to the dealership for car washes and maintenance.  He is a very approachable person that understands the value of relationship building and networking with customers.

Mitch Henson furthered my car buying experience with a fair market value for my trade in vehicle.  Mitch and Richard both exhibited a high degree of trust and integrity when they realized that I had signoff off on the price of my car which was above my agreed upon price.  This was resolved in a professional manner.  I was very appreciative as it was something that I missed as I signed and initialized paperwork.

Greg Lippa coordinated the signing of paperwork for my financing.  Again, this experience was well above average.    I felt like a person in his office and not someone signing over revenue to the dealership.  In fact, Greg was so kind to discuss the process for auto financing upon my inquiry.  This discussion has led me to further seek information related to my personal finances as related to credit and financing.

Overall, I found that there was a common and positive theme within Boardwalk Audi related to customer care.  I have never been so comfortable in a car buying experience.  My family has an A6 and Q7 Audi.  My wife and I are extremely happy with our vehicles.  I will certainly use Boardwalk Audi to service my vehicles and to have first opportunity when the time comes to purchase another pre-owned or perhaps new vehicle.

553,"July 16, 2012","My experience with Rich Goudin at BOARDWALK Audi is what I wish for All new car buyers.  I met Rich 3 months ago when my husband and I told him I was beginning my new car search considering a 2012 AUDI A4, a BMW 5 series or a VOLVO S60. My professional background is sales/customer service for a prominent Dallas new home builder, therefore my customer service expectations tend to be stringent, Rich did not disappoint!  Although he knew from our initial meeting that I was not purchasing until June/July, Rich continued to touch base, always inquiring as to my car buying progress, always adding additional info that reinforced not only the value of making an intelligent decision for Audi but also engaging my desire for an ""exciting driving experience,"" very important to me, I LOVE to drive. Rich was building my customer experience with each contact, and also building a relationship. The success I've enjoyed in my business is most often a result of relentless relationship selling, and that's exactly what I received from Rich.  He knew my actual preference was the A6 but was hesitant due to already exceeding my comfortable price point, as well as being economically conservative regarding gas mileage. When the 2013 AUDI A6 2.0 arrived at the Houston port Rich called me to announce he had ""exactly what I was looking for""! I was leaving on a trip and while he created a sense of urgency, he did NOT become the arrogant seller with the, ""well, you're gonna miss it attitude.""  That would have been a deal breaker for me, I consider that attitude an insult to the buyer's intelligence as well as what my industry refers to as ""desperate selling."" Rich knew my trip schedule and left me a voicemail the day before I arrived home to set up an appointment.  I saw the car the first time with my 7 year old grandson in tow, knowing I wouldn't discuss details at that time, but I was so excited to see the car I went at my first opportunity!  Rich's response when he handed me the keys to test drive the car was, ""I'll get the little guy's booster seat from your car.""  After my test drive, I was sold, not only on my delightful AUDI A6 2.0, which we purchased the next morning, but also on Rich Goudin.  BOARDWALK would have been just another dealership on ""Dealership Row"" in Plano were it not for the knowledge and natural talent of Rich. On a side note, he spent over an hour introducing me to the electronic mysteries of my new car and encouraged me to ""get acquainted with it"" and the come back in for any help I might need with details! Rich is more than an asset to your BOARDWALK team, he is the knowledge today's Buyer's insist upon, he's the comfortable, no bull guy that EVERYONE is searching for when making a major investment, and he's the promise of future care that Buyer's demand in today's economy to feel confident making a financial commitment for their family's safe, sophisticated and wildly fun transportation!  He's my salesman for life, unless of course, I decide to deviate into BMW or back to VOLVO...at which time I'm sure he'll once again, bring me back to my senses, which means AUDI!  
DRIVE SAFELY!...with a smile on your face!

Debby Alcorn",5.0

In the service lounge, they checked in with me periodically, referred to me by name and did not shout out, ""Black A7"".

Also for the test drive they hooked me up with a technical guy..and I didn't expect much out of him. Though he tried to be helpful and nice, obviously he didn't know everything.

I first was helped the day before by Ricky Reed via phone call. He gave me the necessary information to think on before I visited the location. The day that I visited I set up a time to arrive and look at the car. Upon arrival, I saw that the car was parked and ready for a test drive. Alex then informed me that Mr Reed was running a specific errand for another customer. He gave me the keys and before we went on a test drive, Mr Henson called to make sure that I was arriving to look at the car. The test drive was fun in which it had all the different road types; winding roads, school zones, highways, bumpy roads, and a nasty railroad crossing that was fixed prior. 
Upon returning we sat in the comfy leather seats in the lobby and met Mr Reed. He knows what he is doing when it comes to cars and fitting them to the customer. He asked if we wanted anything to drink and how our day was. He was very personable and down to earth. He did not sugarcoat anything with the car. He informed us that the car was the least costly within an 800 mile area; I researched, he was not lying. After figuring the pricing and setting up the financing with the Credit Union, we talked about San Antonio and USAA. I respect veterans and our military. After the transfers and paperwork was complete Mr Henson and Mr Reed referred me to Bruce Blais. He is very informed on warranties and what they offer. I did not buy a warranty, but he was very helpful and not pushy. Upon returning, Mr Reed offered the gift bag, even though I did not buy an Audi, I still got the hat, keychain, and mints.  
Mr Reed is a great help and also gave a follow up call to make sure that I knew about free car washes that are offered by the dealership and how the car was working out for me.

When I pulled the car in to the service garage to have this checked out I spoke to a gentlemen (probably a valet guy)explaining to him what was going on.  He went to talk to his manager I believe.  Sorry, but don't remember either names.  He came back and said basically there was really nothing he could about it.  And that sometimes his blades do that too.  I again, really expressed to him about how really bad they were bouncing/skipping and how I felt this was not normal.  And that it was doing it even in heavy rain.  Finally after two visits back and forth to his manager and myself he brought another gentleman out.  I explained again.  The manager then brought a service technician out and this gentlemand said that it was probably due to some oil on the blades and possibly on the windsheild.  So he cleaned them with some glass cleaner.  I drove around the service/car lot to test it out.  It was still raining at the time so it was a good test.  The cleaning did not make a difference.  They bounced just as vigirous as before.  I drove back up the garage and this actually showed the service men/women so they could see for themselves.  They agreed that this was not normal.

I found the one that we bought from you on cars.com, I think.  Checking the decription of all the extras, we decided that we would like to see the car.  It seemed to be priced better than some of the others we had seen with similar extras.  I had been looking at the car for several weeks, online, and called to see if it was still available.  Ty Estes answered the phone.  I asked if the CR-V was still available and he said that he would have to check because they had been busy that morning.  Still talking to me on the phone, he walked out and seeing the car said that it was still available.  I told Ty that we would be there in about an hour to look at it and take a test drive.  He advised me to ask anyone there for him when we arrived and he would be glad to help us.  When we arrived we asked for Ty and were told that he was with a customer but would soon be with us.  We were offered refreshments and made to feel at home.  Ty was with us soon, got the car and we went for a test drive.  After the drive, Ty went over the car showing what all it had.  We were happy with it and went to Ty's office to discus the purchase.  My wife and I had already been preapproved for a loan with our credit union.  I asked about the ""advertised e price"" and Ty had to go to check about the price.  The price reduced the overall price by a few hundred dollars.  We had to wait for awhile before we were able to go to the financing office.  I'm sorry, I don't remember the gentleman's name.  There we were given a loan rate a little better than we had received from the credit union.  We were offered many options such as Extended Warrenty, Theft Protection and more.  We took advantage of the financing but did not purchase any of the other ""extras"".  I thought it took a little longer than necessary but overall it was a plesant experience.  Ty was helpful & courteous and my wife and I feel we got a good value for our money.  We would be very much at ease recommending this dealership and Ty to anyone wanting to purchase a new or preowned vehicle.",4.6

614,"June 15, 2012","We spent many weeks shopping for a new mid-size SUV and the overall dealership experience was important to us.  After looking at several brands, both the product and the experience at Audi caused us to put the Q5 at the top of our list.  From the moment we entered the dealership we felt welcomed and the staff was friendly but not aggressively selling in any way.  Our brand specialist was extremely passionate about cars in general and Audi's product specifically and had more knowledge then any of those we interacted with at BMW, Mercedes, or Lexus.  We made several visits before deciding on our vehicle and each experience helped us decide on the ideal configuration for our family.  We have taken ownership of our new vehicle and couldn't be more pleased with the car and the purchase experience.

And he told me to come back and take care of the 65,000 servie at a later time before the warranty expired.  The only reason ""quality or work"" was a 4 instead of a 5 is that I had te return to the dealership the next day as a new ""Check engine"" light started coming on the next day, leading me to think that either perhaps something was ""knocked loose"" when the mechanics were under the car for the checkup, or that it was not checked thoroughly after.

When i picked up my car the price quoted to Robert had changed. Robert called the body shop and had them adhere to the quoted price. The car is running as good as new now thanks to Robert.

682,"May 08, 2012","I had a great experience from the time I walked into Boardwalk Audi to the time I came and picked up my car. Robert went above and beyond getting me in and out as quick as possible.  While my car was in the shop, he called to update me several times on the progress.  My car doesn't have a console because I guess the previous owner decided to put in a cd player, so I asked Robert to check on putting one in for me. He called back the next day and said that it would cost too much and he just would hate for me to pay that much. Most service guys wouldn't have said that or they would have made you feel bad if you didn't want to spend the money. I appreciate honesty and I hope he doesn't get into trouble for not making that sale, but I assure you that you will get more business from me based on that and the way I was treated during this whole process.  Even the woman (sorry I can't remember her name) who checked out the rental car to me was very friendly and funny.  I had a lot of luggage to switch over from my car to the rental and they made sure someone helped me with everything. Thanks for such an enjoyable experience! I honestly didn't think that was a possibility at a service department. I will definitely be back.",5.0

Although I wasn't interested in purchasing it after driving it, I did notice a BMW 335i that I was interested in. I returned a week later to look further at it and was helped by Craig Entis. After a test drive showed engine problems with the car, Craig took it to the BMW dealer to get it repaired. I returned two weeks later for a pre-purchase inspection, and was able to quickly meet up with Craig again. I took it to a mechanic with no hassle, and after coming back, worked out a deal with Craig over the price. I received a very good price on the BMW and a fair offer on my trade. Craig was friendly and spent almost 45 minutes chatting with me about fast cars and bikes while waiting for the finance guy to finish with other customers.

715,"April 23, 2012","My Experience at Boardwalk was exceptional.  I had originally emailed the dealership inquiring about a used Q5.  I received a reply within minutes and was able to schedule a test drive that was conveinient for me.  Richard greeted me with a welcoming smile and immediately did his job.  Asking me questions about what the most important quality I was looking for in a vehicle for my family.  I explained that I was looking to get a vehicle with better gas milage as my current vehicle only got 12/18 miles per gallon.  Once he heard that he knew exactly which vehicles to look at.  I test drove the Q5 and loved it.  The drive was smooth and it was definitely roomy.  My only hesitation was that I already had an SUV and really didn't think we needed two.  So next was the Audi A6....a car that my husband has been eyeing for years.  

The feeling you get once you sit in the 2012 A6 2.0 is that of luxury.  The leather seats are large and comfortable.   The dash board offers the flexibility to customize it easily, a feature I have never seen in other vehicles of its class.  The onboard wifi and google map integration to the navagation system takes the 2012 A6 a step above the rest.  The large screen allows the driver to easily navagate all of the menus.  The A6 drives like no other.  The handling of the car is above any other vehicle I have driven in its class. After the test drive I knew that the A6 was for me.   I only needed to confirlm with my husband. Richard invited me to take whichever vehicle to my husband as he was at work.  I chose to take the Q5 as my husband was already knowledgable about the A6.  Once he drove the Q5 and we discussed what we were really looking for in our next vehicle we both agreed the A6 had all of the qualities we were looking for in our next vehicle.  The A6 is luxurious, spacious, and gets great gas mileage.  The best part of this whole experience was that there were several on the lot to choose from.  

The next step was negotiating the price....thankfully it was painless.  We were able to come to an agreement with a few emails and phone calls.  The information was clearly presented in writing and there were no suprises once I came to pick up my vehicle.  Richard was very flexible and accommodating in the timing of picking up my vehicle.  In fact, it was Richard's day off and he came in to make sure that everything went smooth.  Bruce in Finance made everything so easy.  Within 30 minutes, I was in my car going through all of the features on the car.  Once home I was able to use the onboard electronic mannual which features video clips to show you step by step how to do what you need.  

I highly recommend Boardwalk Audi if you are interested in purchasing a vehicle.  Ask for Richard as he is very knowledgable and will work with you to make you a satisfied customer.  ",4.8

752,"April 02, 2012","My wife & I were in the market for a CUV.  We had narrowed the choices down to a BMW X3 and Audi Q5.  My wife really wanted to stay with the Audi brand, so for the past few weeks I'd been looking on-line at the local dealer's Q5 inventory (which by the way is quite limited as the Q5 is very popular).  A couple of weeks ago I spotted a silver Q5 at Audi Dallas, so that set things into motion.

We new that we wanted to work with Corstiaan in some capacity as we had previous purchased 5 news Audis from him - each experience was a delight.   Corstiaan is the General Manager of the dealership, so I didn't  know if still ""got down in the dirt"" with respect to making individual car deals.  On 3/9 I sent an internet inquiry about a couple of Q5s that showed up on Boardwalk's website, but didn't contain specifics (colors / options ) about the vehicles as they were in the port, awaiting shipment to the dealership.  Anthony responded to the on-line inquiry and I stopped by the afternoon of 3/9.

Amazingly, when we looked at the inbound Q5s, one was equipped just about how I would have ordered it from the factory.  The only ""nice to have"" that it was missing was the B&O stereo upgrade (but the standard system is great).  It even had the trailer hitch that I need.  Having this specific vehicle was a 1000-to-1 longshot, but sometimes things just work out.  I should have bought a lottery ticket that evening.

We had a couple of trades I thought that would be a good fit for Boardwalk's used car department  (a 2006 A6 and a 2008 TT).  I had a number in mind for both my trades and the Q5, and after about 3 minutes Corstiaan, Anthony and I were all on the same page and agreed to a deal.

Anthony called to inform me that the Q5 arrived on 3/13.  He was kind enough to take some photos of it on the transporter and let me see it before it went thru PDI.  The only change needed was a swap of the front grille license plate filler, and this was done prior to delivery.

The afternoon of 3/13 my wife and I arrived at the dealership for delivery.  The car was flawlessly prepared and presented.  Anthony gave us very through demonstration of the features and verified with us that everything was perfect.

We then went to F&I where we went thru the paperwork with Bruce.  Bruce is a great guy, who even shares my enthusiasm for motorcycles.  After about 15 minutes we completed the necessary paperwork and were off to enjoy our Q5.

We then said our goodbyes to Anthony and Corstiaan.   My wife drove the Q5 off of the lot and it has been all she has talked about this week!

I can't say enough good things about Boardwalk Audi.  I have purchased cars from some excellent local dealerships (Park Place Lexus / Classic BMW / Plano Mercedes), but my experience with Boardwalk Audi surpassed those excellent experiences.  ",5.0
753,"April 02, 2012","We (my boyfriend and I) were in the market for 2005 Toyota 4Runner. We are from Oklahoma City and had pretty much exhausted our resources trying to find a 4Runner near home. The 4Runner we ended up buying was the first one we saw when looking online at vehicles in Texas. Before ever calling this dealership, we saw pictures of the vehicle online and could tell it was in really great condition. They put of TONS of pictures on their website. This definitely helped us since we were so far away and could not easily go look at the vehicle. I called the dealership to check and see if the 4Runner was still available and ended up talking to Ricky Reed. We could not have asked for a better salesman. I told him what we were interested in and he was quick and efficient at getting us the information we asked for. He was even honest and up front with us about a small amount of damage that was on the front bumper and back quarter panel of the 4Runner. Instead of trying to be like most car salesmen are, he took the risk of telling us there was some damage on it and even sent us pictures of it! Well over the course of a day, we went back and forth about price and such and ended up getting our 4Runner at a great price AND they fixed the damage for us! When we did finally make it to Texas to buy the vehicle, it was in the condition Ricky had told us. The interior was pristine, the body work was fixed and looked very nice, and the car drove great! When we got back home to Oklahoma, we had our mechanic friend check out 4Runner's engine and he even told us we made a great decision in buying this vehicle. We both really appreciated Ricky's honesty and the fact that he did not try to beat around the bush and lie about the damage. That meant so much to me and my boyfriend. We did not have a lot of interaction with the other staff at Boardwalk Audi, but any contact we made with the guys up there was very pleasant. They were all very friendly and helpful. I would definitely recommend this dealership to anyone who is in the market for a new Audi or a nice used car! Be sure to ask for Ricky though! Good job, Ricky! :)",5.0

Not only were the prices much lower than what I'd been experiencing on Craigslist, but the cars were in MUCH better condition. I was very surprised. It's a bit counter intuitive coming from a luxury dealership.

I got an EXTEMELY good value on my Toyota 4Runner (about $4-5k below book) and was floored by the first rate service given to me by the team at Boardwalk. No one else has ever taken such care with finishing touches. My vehicle was presented to me (fully detailed) in what looks like the holodeck from Star Trek with... a FULL tank of gas! Not even Toyota ever did that for me when I purchased a new vehicle.

Hats off to Alex Bieniek and the team at Boardwalk Audi for being committed to treating people with such class and extra care.

Cheers!

760,"March 28, 2012","When I went into the dealership, I didn't know if I wanted a convertible or a SUV.  That didn't trouble Ricky at all and he happily showed my husband and I both options.  Once I drove the A5, then I couldn't decide if i liked the white model or the black beauty.  Again, Ricky couldn't have been more patient and went back and forth with me looking at both.  I was still deciding when we left the dealership, and saw the gray S5...I looked at the price tag and immediately walked away.  I did tell my husband though, who went in to drive the S5 the next day.  He was so pumped, he convinced me to drive it.  Again, Ricky was patient, probably knowing this was a futile test drive based on my price reaction the day before.  When Ricky was telling and showing me all the additional bells and whistles about the car, I knew I was hooked.  When we came in Saturday to buy the car, Ricky had it all ready to go and perfectly glistening.  He had the car cleaned and it looked even more awesome than before.  Ricky took many random calls from my husband and I to respond to questions, and was always professional and friendly.  Before we left with our new ""baby"", Ricky took the time to show us the details of the dash and how to use everything.  He was happy to take whatever time we needed to feel comfortable in our new awesome car.  

When Ricky took us in to meet Bruce to finish the details of the purchase, Bruce was also very friendly and professional.  This part of the deal is the tedious part, but Bruce made it quick, informative, and painless.  What a nice surprise!

He had his most experience technician, Aaron Catelier, come out and meet me to discuss the problem I was having with my car.  Both gentlemen took the time to encourage me that the problem will be fixed. I was offered a brand new 2012 Audi A4 loaner car.  It was a fantastic vehicle to try out.  
I received multiple calls about the status while my car was being worked on. And when the car was finished, I returned to the facility and my car was sitting there all washed and clean.  I was greated again by David and Aaron.  They discussed the problem with my car and how it was repaired.  Both ended my experience with a firm handshake and I left happy and satisfied.

It had been 10 years since my last car purchase. Not really knowing what to expect... or what I wanted for that matter, I eventually procured a used A4. While only being able to reflect on 2 weeks of driving.... it is safe to say that I could not be more satisfied!  

From start to finish I felt as though the decisions being made were in my best interest.  Rich went above and beyond in making sure that absolutely EVERYTHING was sorted for me, right down to the small details that usually get overlooked.

It is a true attest to the statement that...
""Whether your buying a $20,000 car or a $100,000 dollar car you are treated the same."" And Rich proved that with a shadow of a doubt.

Upon further diagnosis, it needed more extensive repair in replacing some injectors. Boardwalk Audi took it upon themselves to rectify the problem and do all the additional parts replacement and labor at no cost to me.

851,"January 31, 2012","First, I would like to recognize Alex Feller. Alex was extremely familiar with the product he was selling and answered all of our questions with accurate information and without hesitation.  My wife and I quickly became comfortable with Alex and soon develop a sense of trust. This is a testament to his professionalism, salesmanship, and personality (top notch).  

Second, one issue I found concerning was the refusal of Boardwalk Audi's management (not Alex) to accept our check issued by Navy Federal Credit Union. Many customers would have walked out of the dealership (I almost did). After reflecting on the issue may have been the rush to receive funds (cashed check) prior to the end of the month was most likely the driving factor. It is my opinion that this is really a poor business practice and customer service. In my many years of automobile purchases, I have never experienced anything like this and it needs to be corrected at once!

Lastly, I want to make it clear that my wife and I are happy with our purchase and we're very fortunate to have had the pleasure of dealing with Alex Feller (true professional). We are hopeful that our future experiences with Boardwalk Audi's service department is as enjoyable as our experience with Alex.

Our mechanic found some issues.  I am dissapointed that the Audi service folks did not find it, but Ricky and the sales team quickly resolved the problems by fixing all of the issues.  My only downside on this is that I had to come back to the dealership several times to get the problems resolved, and as we live in Mckinney, that takes a bit of time for transit.

877,"January 11, 2012","We found our 2009 Audi A4 quattro on line and had the pleasure of working with Chris Garcia. From the very beginning, he was helpful, friendly and knowledgeable. Since we are in Oklahoma, we had to do everything over the phone and it was all positive. We managed to agree to a fair price and Chris gave us all the information needed to do the transaction. We had never bought a car in this manner but I must say it was extremely easy and we felt so comfortable with both our sales agent, Chris, and also the reputation of this dealership. When my husband drove a trailer to pick up the car, he found not only a beautiful and well run dealership but also the friendliest and nicest people. His comment to me was that there was a huge inventory of new cars and we were buying a used, less expensive car but he was treated like a million dollar buyer. Chris was available and in constant contact with us and when my husband arrived, everything was done and the car was ready to come to Oklahoma plus they handled all of our local paper work so it made it so much easier than having to deal with it later. It was our first time to use this method of buying a car out of state and this establishment. It was beyond our expectations. Our Audi is amazing and we feel very fortunate to have found this beautiful car and also this wonderful dealership and our sales person, Chris Garcia. It was worth the trip out of state and I am sure we will be back. ",5.0

Ricky did what he said and when we took delivery of the vehicle, he did everything he said he would.

921,"December 06, 2011","Working with Craig was very enjoyable.  He has a good sense of humor.  I first contacted your dealership unknowingly)through the internet looking for Audi factory incentives.  Craig called me within five minutes of making that inquiry to what seemed like a third party website.  We spent some time on the phone just talking about cars and not just about buying one.  I'm guessing I wasn't the typical Audi customer.  I am not a person of means and have so much money I just walk into a car dealership and pay sticker.  I was pretty demanding (in a nice way) and knew what I wanted to pay for the A5 we purchased.  With very little negotiating, Craig got us to that price.  He understood me as a customer and I'm guessing figured out that I was negotiating out of need and not greed.  I applaud him for that.  I saved money from the sticker price and the dealership still made money which is really what both parties are after in the first place.  

Craig has followed up with us on several occasions in regards to how the car is doing and how we are liking it.  He has also followed up in regards to a ""we owe"" that needed to be done to the car because of the time of day of the sale and the bad weather at the time.  Relationships in business are important and Craig seems to know how to cultivate the proper relationship with a customer.  This is the first Audi I have ever owned and it will not be the last.  I will be a customer with Boardwalk Audi for some time and I will tell people I know looking for an Audi or just a car in general to give Craig and Boardwalk a chance.

925,"December 02, 2011","For me and my wife, our first visit to the Audi dealer in Plano TX was less than satisfactory. The sales person at that time (a name I can't recall, lucky for him) reluctantly helped us but was more interested in answering and talking on his cell phone while he showed us a Q5 in the lot. Apparently we didn't look like real customers and he didn't have time for a test drive? However, after further online reviews, we went back the next weekend to do a 'do-over' and met with a new sales assolciate (Greg Pomeroy). He did a great job showing us what we wanted too see with a nice test drive of a Q5. We then placed a new 2012 Q5 on order in September and just recieved it after the Thanksgiving holidy. Greg provided a much better experience to the purchase of the Q5 doing an overall great job. But due to the initial experience I can't give that dealer an overall GREAT rating. Also, visually the quality of work on a Q5 seems super but I will not answer that resoponse until we have some time behind the wheel to see how well it holds up. As far the the purchase experience itself, it went very smoothly but I will abmit that I did feel like Audi's policy is not to give the customer any real deals, at least with a car you order with such low stock. Granted I was fortunet to get an employee discount from my own company for the Audi Q5 but the nickle/dime extra 'insurance' items at the purchase time seemed to be something that should have come with the purchase. My impression is that Audi either stands behind their vechicles or not without charging a few extra thousand for extra warrentte, paint or other insurance items that should be includded for the price. But I guess their isn't a company out there that wouldn't try to do the same..",4.0

I have nothing, but great things to say about the Boardwalk Audi dealership and their sales team. The facility is beautiful and all of the team is friendly and eager to help each and every customer. As soon as I met Jeff and Richard I knew that I was in good hands. I was convinced that the Q5 was the ideal vehicle for me and I had actually test driving the Q5 at another Audi dealership. I decided to visit Boardwalk Audi because I read reviews of their great sales team and immaculate facility. Once I visited the Boardwalk Audi dealership and met Jeff Hummel I knew that it was the right dealership to purchase my 2012 Q5. Richard Gouhin did everything that he could do satisfy my every need, Rich and Jeff worked closely together to get my behind the wheel of my Q5.

After searching in ebay/autotrader and other online sites, I found this car which exactly match with my old car. Only differences were this car is 2009, less miles and some more upgrades. I communicated through email and got response back with a sales manager assignment. On Monday I called Corey who is assigned and gave him an offer on road. The offer accepted and I faxed the credit request. Afternoon around 2 I reached the dealer, the car was ready. Only stuff pending was to sign papers. I was predetermined to purchase extended warranty because it is a European car, so no much issue in the cabin with the finance officer. Overall the transaction went really smooth with no sales talk or waste of time.

The reason I gave overall experience 4 and Price 4 is this. 

Price - The dealer I purchased by previous car in Atlanta, gave me same car (only difference is black color) with same options, same  year for $1500 less. Since I was urgent to buy car, I went with the one in Dallas.

Overall experience - The dealer who sold me the previous car, really did wonderful job on detailing the car, replacing tires, doing the service etc prior to shipping it to me. I felt the car was like new eventhough it had 36000 miles on it. But this car, I felt like the car was not detailed well interior or exterior. Shampoo work did not was not good. Also dings, scratches on the car was not fixed fully. But on positive note, Corey suggested to bring it back to fix all of those. 

I buy luxury used cars or new cars because of the experience I receive from the dealership, I do feel Boardwalk Audi and Corey is doing great job on giving me that experience. I recommend this dealer and the sales person.",4.6

My car was in the service area when I received a follow up call from Anthony Carvalho, I wasn't planning on buying or even trying to get a car that day but through a series of conversations that began the previous day about ""eventful situations"" that can happen to a person with my sister I went
to service area to get more information about my from Christian Greer .

I met Anthony out in the car park area while thinking through my situation , he asked me a few questions and to wait around to see what he could do for me. That simple request provided me with a new (for me)  certified 2008 Audi. Anthony's attitude was remarkably positive  as he worked through the possibilities for me. The manner in which he approached my situation kept me there wanting to see what could come of it all.  

Once the car was chosen , he gave half his ham & turkey sandwich (not bad either) :) , introduce me to Bruce in finance , who also helped me greatly, and stayed with me throughout the process.

This is my 3rd Audi and I experienced a wonderful service event from the employees of Boardwalk Audi.  My thanks Anthony and also Bruce

Thanks to Corey and his manager Jeff, I've decided to continue and made a purchase. Corey Small deserves a Star.

1018,"August 26, 2011","My husband and I bought a 2009 Honda Civic Coupe from Chris a few days back and it has been an awesome experience. Buying a used car is a stressful experience for most people and it is usually with much cautiousness that I approach a car sales person (kinda like the badger ad) but Chris put us at ease immediately with his honesty, eagerness and overall great customer service attitude. He was frank about what that has been done and NOT done to the car and he made no false promises. During the test drive on the first day, we heard a knocking sound and not only Chris heeded our concerns, he also took it in to the Honda dealership for us to get it fixed the very next morning. ALL the used car sales persons we have met before Chris shrug off our concerns and dismiss our worries with the typical &quot;it's a used car, of course it will come with xxx&quot;. That made us feel like just because we were interested in a lower priced car, we weren't as important. When a sales person does this, it will break the deal for me because I couldn't trust his/her words anymore. Our first-time application for financing was a little tedious, Chris has been the most patient while we spent hours sorting it out. Business manager Johnny Funes, likewise, exhibited impressive customer service attitude. There were hitches getting the insurance coverage and we had to look up information on his computer. We took a longer than expected time to wrap up what we had to do and were embarrassed to delay his work. Johnny was extremely patient and did not request we hurry (which we wouldn't have taken offence, :) and I must say, that was just so nice and helpful of him to let us have the time to do what we needed though in some way, it didn't have anything direct to do with the sales. Overall, I give Boardwalk Audi a million stars rating for service and will definitely do business with them again.",4.8

1030,"August 19, 2011","At first I had a negative experience at Boardwalk Audi.  I was trying to decide on make and model of a new car and decided to look at Audis.  When I walked in, I went over to look at a specific model, and was soon greeted by a sales guy.  He answered a few basic questions, and showed a couple of features on the car.  While I was looking at the car, some other potential customers walked into the showroom, and the sales guy said, ""I'll be back..."" and walked over to them.  He never came back.  I had been dumped.  After 20 minutes, I decided it was time to go to another car dealer and look at some competition.  The Audi I was looking at was very pretty, but I didn't see anything that was exceptional, as far as options.  

Right as I was leaving, I was approached by another sales representative; Greg Pomeroy.  He saw I was looking at a certain model, and starting showing me a ton of really cool features, and explaining them.  I was suddenly really psyched about this car. I mean REALLY psyched!  Then he popped the question: ""Would you like to take one for a drive?""  I said, ""Yes, but I was told by the last sales guy the version I am interested in was not currently in stock"".  Greg, said (as he walked me out to the version I had asked the last guy about)""He didn't know about this one"".  So,I drove it.  

Audi was the first make of several new cars I looked at.  3 weeks later after giving all the competitors a serious look and a test drive, in my head I kept coming back to the Audi!  I couldn't get that car out of my mind!  It drove like a dream, had amazing visibility and features.  Every other car I looked at just didn't compare.  It was like being single and going on a lot of dates with very successful, nice people, but not caring if I had a second date with any of them... except for that one!  There was that one special date you keep thinking about!  And so it was with the car search!  I finally had it narrowed down to 2 cars, and frankly the other was less expensive and had amazing features, but I see a million of them on the road.  I rarely see my Audi on the road.  It is gorgeous and really stands out as a special car in looks, handling and features.  I had to decide on which car to buy, and I asked myself, if I bought the Audi and I saw the other car go by, would I even care?  If I had bought the OTHER luxury car and I saw my Audi driving by, my heart would have sunk a little as I would have thought... ""I could have had that fun car! I probably should have gone with the Audi...""     

And, the facilitation of making the deal, financing, paper signing, getting my keys went seamlessly.  It wasn't the new car horror story I remember from my youth where I felt like I had been beaten down by the whole experience.  

So the reason I have a 2 day old Audi is because of a very nice, no pressure sales person (Greg Pomeroy, if you didn't get that name before!) who is enthusiastic about his cars, knows all the features and how they work, and knows his inventory!  If he hadn't walked up to me he did, I would definitely be driving a different make of luxury car. 

It turns out I was waiting for my dream car to arrive in about 2 weeks directly from Germany, when I suddenly get a call from Greg, saying that a car with all the features I want suddenly came available 2 hours before. Greg looks out for his customers, and he called me.  I ran down there, looked at it as they were closing, and bought it on the spot!  So, I rate Audi the highest on all categories, except dropped the ""all categories"" to a ""4"" due to that first sales guy.  I highly recommend Boardwalk Audi, and I would go straight to Greg Pomeroy if I was even interested in looking at them, even if you don't want to buy.  He just knows everything about his cars, and you will walk away being very impressed with Audis in general and Boardwalk Audi because of his enthusiasm and knowledge about his cars!",4.8

The next time i came the service advisors were inattentive as usual but a gentlemen greeted me when I pulled up by the name of Alex Feller and he was absolutely a delight.  He is the ONLY reason I kept coming back to Boardwalk Audi-Plano.  He would always greet me with a smile and was very helpful. He told me that the dealership was going through some changes and things would get better.  He introduced me to Christian Greer and David Adame and that made a world of difference. They too were on top of their game and great to work with. After one year of owning my car I would say that Boardwalk Audi's service department has definitely turned things around.

that you are in a emotional state of mind buying a nice car. you will not said a thing.

He's very knowledgeable and helpful in getting my car fixed right the first time, explaining to me the issues with the car, and ensuring I am not inconvenienced as a result.  David is one of the best service reps I've ever had the pleasure of dealing with and I've owned a lot of luxury cars (Porsche, Mercedes, BMW) but my Audi purchase has given me the best experience with a service center and an Audi fan for life.

Alex Feller, who also works in the service department at Audi is wonderfully helpful everytime I bring my car in for service.  Alex ensures I get in and out quickly weather its with a loaner car, ride home or some other convenience.  Alex also ensures that my car is clean and waiting for me to go when I arrive to pick up my vehicle and if there is an question with my bill has on more than one ocassion helped me understand the charges.  

Thanks to both David and Alex for the wonderful support and customer service they have provided me over the past two years!",4.8

HE is the reason I bought a second vehicle from this dealership..  Not only does he provide second to none customer service, he is extremely knowledgeable about the product he works with.  Why are his talents being wasted in the capacity of valet?  If there ever was anyone who would excel tremendously in sales, it is this very special young man.  He is so friendly and so knowledgeable.  His talents should be used on the showroom floor to help people buy cars.  He instantly makes you feel at ease.  His personality is so conducive to interaction.  I liked him the moment I met him.  He is an asset to the dealership and Audi's biggest fan.

To whom it may concern,
Today we are proud owners of new 2012 Audi Q5. Before we made this purchase, we took our time to research other manufactures and compare safety, price and functionality. We narrowed our search down by visiting several Audi dealerships in the area. Upon our first face to face meeting with Greg Pomerey, he was proactive in extending us help, having noticed we had been waiting quite some time on a very busy Saturday afternoon. He addressed every concern we had about each model and more important, answered every question respectfully and with genuine sincerity. At no time did we ever feel rushed or pressured. During the critical negotiations phase of buying our SUV, his positive attitude, knowledge, professionalism and patience surpassed all salespersons we have dealt with to date. In the future, I can with great confidence refer Greg to my family and friends. We thank him and Jose, the sales Manager (who was terrific too) for making our buying experience a pleasant one. Key factors that closed this deal were negotiations skills with genuine sincerity, never rushed, patience, price and product knowledge. 
 Sincerest Thanks to Boardwalk Audi and its representatives,
Mr. & Mrs. Mark Mason

1082,"July 28, 2011","This was the first time to visit an Audi dealership. Our son worked at one several years ago and always raved about Audis, so I thought I would test drive one just to compare with BMW and Jaguar. Chris Stone was busy with another customer, but took the time to let us test drive a couple of used cars knowing I was trying to downsize from a Jaguar XKR and wouldn't be a big ticket customer. I gave him my card when we left on a Saturday and next Tuesday he called to follow up. My husband and I were impressed with the car, but wanted to think about it. We were never pressured, but felt he was genuinely concerned with our situation (health issues). To make a long story short, we bought the car, traded in my husband's beloved Jag and financed it at a great interest rate. The car had some minor issues, which Chris drove a loaner to my work and picked up the car to have the repairs made. The service guys were also very nice and explained exactly what was wrong with the car. I was very impressed with the willingness of this dealership to help me even though I bought a used car.

To Whom it may concern;
We've had issues with the transmision on our 2003 Audi twice. The first transmission (approx 30k miles) had failed and was replaced by warranty in 2008.  Unfortunately, the newly replaced rebuilt tranmisstion went out again 2.5 year later. My wife loves this car and was crushed thinking we may need to junk the car since we no longer have the car covered under warranty. The estimate to fix the car was $8500.00.  I talked with the Servce Rep and was not getting breaks on the price. 

I called AUDI Headquarters and told them about my transmission issue and history and asked what could be done.  A few days later I received a call from Christina from Audi Customer Relations who had investigated our case. By the end of the week, she had contacted Boardwalk Audi and authorized a 75% discount on the transmission repair. I visited with Craig Bowen at Boardwalk Audi who helped us with the total costs of all repairs for the car, which would have totalled over $9k. 

Mr.Bowen at Boardwalk Audi was very concerned and committed to providing me superior customer service and keeping us happy as we have been customer of Boardwalk for many years. Working with people like Craig makes me return as a customer. We are very pleased with the arrangements that Christina/Audi HQ and Mr. Bowen/Boardwalk Audi were able to offer us, which helped us tremendously.  We are now able to once again enjoy driving this beautiful sporty convertible around town!  Thanks you Audi HQ and Boardwalk Audi of Plano, TX. Another happy customer...

She also did a great job with following up with me during and after the sale to be sure I was completely satisfied.

1131,"May 28, 2011","As this is our 4th Audi purchase in eight years, my wife and I felt we had a benchmark to compare Boardwalk Audi.  Our experience at Barrier Audi in Bellevue, WA from sales to service has always exceeded our expectations.  Therefore we came to expect the same from Boardwalk Audi.

Our first interaction with Boardwalk was with your service department when we moved to Dallas in 2010.  Without question, from customer service to work performed, Boardwalk met and even exceeded our expectations.  It is so refreshing to be served by people who genuinely seem to enjoy their jobs.  I want to single out David and Alex in the service department:  David for his obvious skill and knowledge of the Audi brand and to Alex for just being a breath of fresh air whom I look forward to interacting with on my visits to Boardwalk.  Both are reasons it was an easy decision to purchase our next Audi at Boardwalk because we knew we'd be taken care of.

Unfortunately, when it came time to buy our new vehicle, that's where things fell off a bit.  My first visit to the sales area was on the early evening of Friday, May 20th.  Upon entering, there was no one to greet me and after spending close to 10 minutes ""browsing"" the showroom floor,  I had to actually ask someone for assistance.  I was met by Rebecca Perry who was pleasant and extremely friendly. I explained to her that I was killing time while my wife was at an appointment.  After our brief interaction, I decided that my wife and I would return after I picked her up and we returned an hour later.

As current Audi owners, we didn't necessarily need to be ""sold"" on Audi.  However, from the beginning, I felt Rebecca tried a bit too hard to convince us of something we already knew.  Furthermore, as a salesperson myself, one of the most difficult things all salespeople suffer from is the art of listening instead of speaking.  We LOVE to hear ourselves talk.  Throughout our sales experience, there were a couple of instances where we felt we weren't being heard as much as Rebecca was waiting to tell us the next thing she wanted to say.

Additionally, we felt as if Rebecca's knowledge of the vehicle left a bit to be desired.  It became obvious to both my wife and I that we knew more about some of the features and controls of our Q5 than Rebecca did.  
One final example is that when we left the dealership on Friday evening for an engagement, we asked to have financials on a 42 and 48 month lease as well as a 60 and 72 month purchase with a promise to return on Saturday afternoon.  We watched as she wrote down everything we needed.

When we returned on Saturday, hoping to see numbers, not only did we not get financials but she proceeded to ask us for the information a 2nd time.  Now, I'm a reasonable guy and I know that the majority of people who ""promise"" to come back tomorrow never return.  Furthermore, we didn't run any credit that evening so we even allow for the fact that she couldn't get accurate information.  However, upon our return on Saturday she should have at least utilized the information we provided as a starting point to obtain true financials.  To come back the next day and be asked for the same information we saw her write down was a bit frustrating.

All this is not to say that we didn’t enjoy our overall sales experience.  We did.  I allow that my wife and I, she with a finance background and myself a seasoned sales professional, are not the easiest people to sell to.  We are, by our own definition, “sophisticated buyers who thoroughly educate themselves and have a clear idea of what we want.”  When we heard things like “I really thought we had a deal” and “I thought you were going to buy today” they really rang hollow.  I imagine that Rebecca is very successful at what she does as she has a friendly demeanor and engaging personality.  Where I would “coach” her is to be more of a listener and key in on what she hears.   The customer’s needs will become evident and they will help her close more deals than she can count.

I must point out that Jose was and is an absolute star.  He came in, heard what we wanted and made the deal happen.  We both enjoyed him and he helped navigate our way through what had become, up to that point, a bit of a clumsy experience.

Johnny in your finance department was phenomenal and it has nothing to do with the fact that we share the same name and are both left-handed.  We told him we were in a hurry and he had our paperwork done in about 15 minutes; we were able to make our appointment just a few minutes late.

Overall, I am a pleased with the experience and pleased with Boardwalk Audi. Has the experience exceeded my expectations?  Candidly, no, it hasn't.  But despite that I will recommend Boardwalk in the future and as long as I’m living here, we will make our Audi purchases there.  I’m further convinced that you will work towards exceeding my expectations in the future – of this I am confident. 

Thank you for enduring my long-winded response, but, as I said earlier, we salespeople love to hear ourselves talk (and write, apparently).

1135,"May 18, 2011","The paperwork took over an hour to complete on a cash deal.  The man who was doing the paper work was short, rude and not professional.  We were the only people in the dealership at that time so it isn't like he was overloaded.  He was unwilling to answer direct questions about charges on the bill and acted angry that we were questioning the charges.  If it weren't for Rebecca being so nice we would have walked on the deal because of his attitude.  When we went to pick up the car he presented us with a total that didn't include the deposit amount and I received a dirty look when I questioned his number.  Two days later and he was the same poor attitude bearing a wrong number. 

Rebecca is new to Audi.  She knows car sales and didn't waist our time looking at cars that didn't meet our criteria and for that we are very happy.  She was by far the best part of the experience.  It is very unfortunate that her support staff doesn't provide the same level of service that she is trying to.  

The manager was supposed to be at the delivery to show me (and Rebecca) how the car worked but he decided that he had other things to do so I was left with the manual to answer many of my questions.  I don't hold this against Rebecca since she is trying to get all of the current models mastered and did the best that she could to help me.  

This is the 3rd car that I have purchased from Boardwalk Porsche/Audi and I continue to find that the sales and service people do a great job, but once you get beyond that they continue to fall short.  There was no recognition that I was a past customer of the dealership or my loyalty to them.  It makes me hesitant to return to the dealership for service because of our treatment by the staff.",3.0

Second -- and this takes some explaining -- my last lease was a 2008 BMW 535i. Great car. The 2011 model, not so much. Bruce picked me up from the Dallas BMW place as I finalized the end of my BMW lease -- and my new Audi no less. That was a hoot. His is a soft sell approach; quick and accurate with his answers, and delivered in a lower key. Entirely satisfied with my purchase and with Boardwalk's approach.

1157,"March 09, 2011","We didn't intend on getting a car so quickly but with my son turning one it instantly catapulted my husband into the mania of ""tank buying."" By ""tank"" I mean the safest-longest lasting baby hauler we could find. We settled on the Q7 due to it's ""I'm still young enough to possibly fake being cool while shopping for groceries in my jammies-vibe"". 
So my determined and somewhat firm husband went off to ""test drive one"" - little did I know he would be coming home with one. Alas, our issues with snap decisions is made for another time. What you are looking for is how did you guys do. Well I will tell ya. 
The first time we came in a very nice young man helped us out with the car. We later found out that he wasn't even a sales man. Promote that young kid-he's the reason we stuck with you. He was young and worked in the maintenance department (I think) and helped out on the weekend. I believe his name was Chad. He was on the taller side, blonde, white kid (great I just described ever senior from Plano East). 
Anyways- he helped us out on our test drive and allowed us to experience the car without overly selling it or giving us mind numbing facts and figures. He respected our intellect and our driving experience-it was good. When we told him we were rushing off for an appointment with BMW (which wasn't even a lie to get out of the place it was the truth) he said ""Well then I know you will be back"". And back we came.
My husband dealt with Bruce for the buying/haggling/thumb wrestling portion of the experience. From what I heard from him the experience was respectful yet firm. He said he actually enjoyed it. He (my husband) can be quite the ""car czar"" when negotiating cars. I'm sure you guys have a much better term for people like him *tee hee*. When I came (after the deal was sealed) I met with Bruce (who has wonderful taste in both glasses and ties) he was very nice and helpful. I must say the length of time to buy a car is somewhat eye stabbing especially when dealing with a one year old baby in tow. BUT that's a whole other argument. 
The sales and financing team stayed well after the buying was done to help us into our car. Bruce personally stayed to walk us through the onboard computer mastermind of a car that we just bought. He was wonderful, reassuring, personable and a great teacher. I could honestly tell that he enjoyed interacting with people and teaching them about the cars. It really seemed like he loved the cars (I'm a teacher and I can spot a ""selling-it-in"" a mile away). 
So- ya. It was great! Kudos to you guys and all your shiny trophies, cool cars and caring sales staff. I hope everyone involved in this sale gets a bonus or a free car or something like that.....you guys give them to everyone right? 
Hope that the buying experience is as smooth as maintenance.

1176,"December 16, 2010",What a joke! I can't believe these guys are even still in business! Run... As far away from this place as you can. Want an Audi? Drive further away to another dealership. It'll be the best move you've ever made!  They employee's will flat out tell you they're to busy to provide great customer service and they wish they could do more. Sad but it's true. They're over-worked and don't do enough!,1.0
1177,"April 23, 2010","Emailed and spoke to internet rep on wednesday about used q7.  Made an offer from Houston for the truck and they sent me an official quote with their offer.  Went and got my financing done and called back on Friday to complete the deal.  When the internet agent went to the sales manager to get everything finalized he pulled his offer.  This was their response via email, didn't even have the guts to call me--""Unfortunately, there have have been some other charges for work that was done, added to the cost of this vehicle.  So, since the deal we orignally offered you was all ready losing quite a bit money and now with the added expense.............they will not even do the deal that you and I spoke about"".  If I dealt like that with my customers I'd be out of work real fast.  What ever happened to integrity and living up to your word.  At least pick up the phone and tell me in person.  Did everything change that much over the course of two days?  Used car salesman get the stigma for a reason.  Absolutely ridiculous.",1.0

1179,"September 10, 2009","I live in Missouri but discovered a used car online at Boardwalk Audi. I called the dealership and made an offer to the salesman on a Thursday, and they accepted. Friday goes by, Saturday, Sunday and Monday with no word from them. I saw online that the car was ""SOLD"" and I assumed of course it was to me. I finally called Monday, only to discover that even after they ""sold"" the car to me for a specified price, they had disregarded their word and sold it to someone else instead, and never even bothered to inform me of ANY of the transactions.

1180,"August 17, 2009","I went to Boardwalk for an alignment today and the entire experience was horrible. They promised me it would be ready in 1.5 hrs, so when I hadnt heard from them in 2.5 hrs, I called and they told me it would be 24 hours.   David also tells me the technician says my brakes are down to 5 mm and I need new ones.  Apparently they dont realize my boyfriend is in the auto industry as well, and knows that you do NOT need new brakes when they are at 5 mm.  So they were just trying to upsell me on brakes, and some sort of additional service that I dont recall the name of, but know that I dont need.

They gave me a total POS for a loan car - something called a Pontiac Aveo. I would have rather been given a golf cart.  Then they charged me $22 in shop supplies on an ALIGNMENT.  Ummmm hello, there are no supplies on an alignment!!! So now I get to go back tomorrow and bitch to the manager about the incorrect charges.... Total pain in the @ss experience.  I've had much better experiences with UP Audi, when Kim was still a service advisor. ",1.2
1181,"July 01, 2009","This was a perfect experience. The low preassure and complete attention that Bob gave to me made me feel like I was the only customer he has ever had. His manager, Nickie, made sure that everything went like I wanted it to. This has been an unbelievable experience. I will never go to another dealer or salesperson again. ",4.6
1182,"September 29, 2006",I went in to get my front license plate mounted as Audi by default does not make the car with a front license plate holder.  It is the LAW to have both a front and rear tag in Texas.  Roy said I would have to pay $120 to have the plate mounted.  I said it is the law to have a front plate and should be included in the purchase price of the car.  Roy said I should have negotiated having my plate mounted as part of the car purchase price.  I told him it wasn't even listed as an option.  He insisted I would have to pay to make my car street legal.,2.4
1183,"February 26, 2004","The service department in general is rude, understaffed, not attentive to customer needs, and not trustworthy.  I took my car in for service and received it back with several hundred more miles on it than when I dropped it off.  I was also given a hard time getting a loaner vehicle when I dropped it off, waited over an hour to leave the dealership and was late for a meeting in the process, and the service manager was completely unreceptive to my frustration with the entire experience.  In fact, rather than apologizing when I spoke to her about it later, she tried to downplay the incident and refused to take responsibility for anything.  Overall, this is the most arrogant, pooly trained, most overrated dealership in the Dallas area.  From a customer service standpoint, the service department is pathetic.  Sales is mediocre depending upon who works with you and the management couldn't care less.  In two words, don't bother.",2.0
