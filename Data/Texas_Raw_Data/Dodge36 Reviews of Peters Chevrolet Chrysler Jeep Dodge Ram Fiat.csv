0,"January 22, 2019","I bought a brand new Jeep Wrangler in December 2017 . I spent 32,000.
In July 2018 my information was used to finance a 2012 Ford pickup for 12,500.
Peters used my SSN ,name, phone number to secure a loan for another customer.
This was Identity Theft and Bank fraud according to the bank investigator where 
the loan was taken out. I had to fill out a affidavit to get the bank to stop calling 
me and get the loan taken off my credit report. It's now been over 6 months and 
there are still inquiries on my credit report that affects my rating. I can't get them
removed. Never again!",1.0
1,"January 15, 2019","Peter's claimed the part needed was no longer available and the tack could not get to part ti be replaced, did not have the tools necessary. After blowing out the new module the blame was placed on the weather.  The SSR was at the Dealership for three days. I took the SSR to a private auto repair. $1100.00 to repair Peters mistake and in two days found the part necessary and repairs made.",1.6
2,"September 14, 2018","I inquired about a used Corvette for sale at Peters Chevrolet. They do NOT have pics on their web site of this $50,000 car for sale. However it is the year model that I'm looking for, so I asked them to please send me pics of the car. Well, I get a call from a salesman name John. He said before I send pics let me know you looking for in this car. I was like, well, I don't even know if i'll like the car because I don't know how the paint looks, and if there is any damage. And he still won't send pics.....Really? your selling (trying to sell) a $50k but oh no, your not allowed to see pics of the car first. LOL. I live 2 hours away, I need to see pics first. Is that too much to ask? Well, at Peters Chevrolet I guess it is.",1.0
3,"October 03, 2012","I would highly recommend this dealership. Isaac was very knowledgeable, friendly and straight forward. Did the deal over the phone and everything was exactly as he said it would be. Drove 5 hours to get the best deal after researching other dealers on the internet for over a month. This was without a doubt the best car buying experience in 37 years of purchasing vehicles. Signed paperwork within 5 minutes. Dealership closed at 6:00 pm but Isaac went over every detail of our new truck until after 7:00pm. He truly cares about his customers and it shows in the way he does business.  We will definitely go back to Isaac and this dealer for our next vehicle purchase.",5.0
4,"June 05, 2011","  When you walk in and meet Terry, you get an immediate feeling of dealing with a person that wants to make you happy. I knew we were ""clicking"", for some reason or other, and finally asked if he was from around Longview. Come to fine out Terry graduated from the same school (Longview High) a year behind me. Unfortunately, we could not recall each other from back then, but threw out 20-30 names of mutual friends we went to school with. I knew then that was the reason we were getting along so well. Terry acted like I was the only customer that had ever walked into his office and made us feel right at home. 
  Terry was honest about what he could do for us, kept a smile going and made me want to buy my new truck right then and there and not look for a better deal, which I do not believe I could have found anyway. 
  With the world of the internet, it makes shopping and comparing so easy, but to meet and get to know a salesman like Terry, makes the new vehicle shopping experience worth the eye to eye contact. 
  If he would have been a pressuring, ""come on, I havn't got all day, I have other customers"" type of fellow, we would have walked out the door and never looked back and, trust me, I have before. 
  Now to the sales manager....give Terry a pat on the back and take him to lunch cuz these are the type of salesmen you can not afford to let walk out. If you had 3 of him, it would be worth 15 of the salesmen at the chevy place in Texarkana.",5.0
5,"June 02, 2011","Jace is a fantastic person and for the first time in a car buying expierence I actually felt as if he had me and my best interest at hand. I felt as if he were working hard to get me the best deal he could both for my trade and and on the price of the new car. Once I made it back to the finance department Floyd was very helpful and did an excellent job for me. Over all this was my best buying expierence to date. I will recommend Jace to all of my family, friends, and my clients when they are in the market for a new car.",5.0
6,"June 01, 2011","We were very happy with Issac and your dealership. We drove all the way from Arkansas to purchase the Dodge 3500 and it was worth it. We have dealt with other dealerships and the experience was not the best. I really appreciate the respect and customer care the employee's at Peters showed us.

Thank you for a very good experience!

7,"May 21, 2011","VERY IMPRESSED with David Hawkins.  He treated like family, very attentive and respectful.  I will diffently tell anyone I know to purchase the vehicle from Peters and have Dave Hawkins for their salesman.  He did all that he promised he would and more.  

Steven the finance manager did all he could for us to get in a better vehicle , and was also very pleasant to do business with.

David also has contacted us even after the sale to make sure everything was working out for us.  We just appreciate all that was done for us.",5.0

9,"May 04, 2011","I felt very cared for at Peter's.  Ron was very kind to me, as were Terri and Scott.  Other sales personnel were very nice to me.  I did not get everyone's name.  I really thought I had made new friends! I will recommend Ron and Peter's to anyone I know that is in the market for a vehicle.",5.0
10,"April 13, 2011","Great buying experience. The only issue we had was taking so long for our trade payoff check to reach the bank. So therefore I have a negative on my credit now because of this. Other than that, friendly service, great salesman, and the finance dept was awesome. ",4.8
11,"March 29, 2011","I was dealing with Marco Hernandez and he turned it over to Ron Luttrell to finish.  Marco is a friend of my husband.  We have bought other vehicles at this location before.  Everybody was super friendly and ready to wait on us!

13,"March 23, 2011","I bought a new Ram Cummins 2500 about a month ago. Peters had the truck I wanted, at the best price within a hundred mile radius -- in fact, they gave me the 2010 incentive price on a 2011 truck! The sales process was painless, and the vehicle is great so far. Working with my salesman was great, and when he had the day off when I wanted to come pick the truck up, Peters had another guy complete the deal with me seamlessly. These guys really understand teamwork and customer service.

I'll do business at Peters again, and also recommend the dealership to my friends.",5.0
14,"January 25, 2011",ron was very appreciative of our business and we really feel that he did all that he could do to make our sure our requests were met per what we requested in a vehicle. was not to pushy in making our decision and answered all of our questions or request very promptly. when we buy our next vehicle ron will be our first choice no matter what dearlership he is at,4.8
15,"January 24, 2011",Isaac did a great job taking care of the two issues that I had with the vehicle. They were the low tire pressure light not going off in the dash and discovering that the spare tire was missing later after I bought the truck. I would recommend Peters to others and will be happy to do business with them again. ,5.0
16,"January 21, 2011",Isaac was very friendly and easy to talk to.  He was a great salesperson.  I appreciate the fact he was very open and personable.  I drove a bit over 100 miles to pick up the Mazdaspeed3.  I have enjoyed the car thus far and will continue to enjoy driving it.,5.0
17,"January 21, 2011","Ron approached us when we arrived at Peters and made our car buying experience wonderful. It was speedy and painless. Ron followed up with us repeatedly to make sure everything was going good. I'm thankful Ron was our salesman! He continues to check on us and does whatever I may need him to do, ie: make an appointment for me to come in and get my oil change. He's also gone out of his way to pick up my vehicle for service. Thanks Ron!",5.0
18,"January 20, 2011","My boss told me about Isaac. He said he was pleased with him, so we asked for him when we came in. We were looking for another vehicle when we fist came in. Isaac was very helpful to get what I wanted. When the car came in I could not get to the dealership until the next day. The vehicle had already been sold. Isaac new I was also looking at Jeeps. He asked if we wanted to look at a Jeep. We really wanted the Jeep Grand Cherokee, so Isaac woked with us on price & trade-in. He was able to get it where we could afford. Isaac appears not only to care about Peter's & his job, but truly cares about his customers. I will & have recommended Peter""s & Isaac Tovar.",5.0
19,"January 19, 2011","Brian is very friendly and gave us a great price right off the back.  He didn't seem to be playing games.  I asked to be in and out of the dealership within 15 minutes (have the car washed and fueled, papers ready, etc.) and that is  what happened.  We didn't want to spend too much time there, since we live in New Mexico and had to get back.  
Thanks again!

20,"January 18, 2011","When I go shopping for a new vehicle, I look for a knowledgable, friendly, low pressure salesman. Isaac exceeded all my expectations and has taken care of any issues after the sale. My experience with the other local dealers does not even compare to the service I have had with Peters. Great Job!! ",5.0
21,"January 18, 2011","I live in Houston and had been looking locally for a ""near new"" dakota, without any luck.  I finally found what I had been looking for at Peters Dealership thur an internet posting.

The actual purchase was quick and first class in every step of the process. Isaac was on top of each stage of the purchase process which kept the transaction a stress free event. Isaac was professional and motivated to ensure I would be impressed with the customer service of the Peters Dealerships.  I was impressed !!",5.0
22,"January 18, 2011","The main problems i had with my 07 nitro are due to the vehicle which had nothing to do with the salesman. Brian was polite. and for the most part knowledgable. There was a couple thing he couldnt tell me, most was not important.He also made sure to follow up with me which is quite important.",4.6
23,"January 18, 2011","Isaac was very helpful in getting me the best price that he could. I could also tell that he really wanted my business. He made sure my family and I were comfortable and spent a great deal of time going over all the features of the vehicle with us, which I had never had happen before. In addition, the dealership did not try and sell me any extras that I did not want. The customer service and friendliness were the best I have experienced when buying a car. ",5.0
24,"January 18, 2011",Isaac has been such a joy to work with.  We have purchased two vehicles through him.  Great experiences and we love our vehicles.  Will definitely come back when it's time to purchase again.  Always hear from him on birthdays - great personal service.,5.0
25,"January 18, 2011","Issac Tovar is a nice guy.  He did everything that he could do to make me a deal.  He never hid anything and was very straight forward.  I did not get the price that I wanted for my trade in (the price I was offered at other dealerships).  However, they never said anything that they couldn't do.  We were able to make a deal and I have been happy with my truck to date.",4.0
26,"January 18, 2011","My relationship with this dealership was based on the understanding that I was looking for value in a used truck and that I expected an expediant process.  These criteria were met with  above expected results and subsequantly I will return the next time I am in the market.  Thank you Ron.

Sincerely,

Joel Nail ",4.8
27,"January 17, 2011",  Ron was very helpful with my wife and I in our situation. He was very informative and has probably changed my opinion of car dealers. When I get ready to trade again he will be the first person I visit. Since my wife and I bought our trucks Ron has checked on us several times and been quick to help in anyway needed.,4.8
28,"January 17, 2011",Brian was very helpful and really went out of his way to make my vehicle buying experience enjoyable and somewhat easy.Brian's great customer service is what made my auto buying experience enjoyable.The rest of the transaction was not very pleasant and very unprofessional on many levels including the finance company in which was chosen on my auto loan. ,4.5
29,"January 17, 2011",Peters Cars is the best dealership I've ever done business with.  They are honest and professional when dealing with their customers.  Even though their dealership is over two hours away we will go back to purchase our next vehicle.  We highly recommend Peters Cars to all of our friends and family.,5.0
30,"January 17, 2011","Great to work with.  Our deal was fair and they did some minor body work to the car which was done to our satisfaction.  They were prompt with the paperwork and called immediately once the body work had been completed, and again when the plates arrived.",4.8
31,"January 17, 2011","Looked at the car on Saturday at lunch and had things ready by 6:30 Saturday evening. Everything that was promised was handled promptly and done without any hassle at all. 
After having the car for a few weeks, i noticed a few problems. Called Ron and he set me up with an appointment for service. John took care of all problems and had the car back to me the same week as promised.
Great experience from sales and service/warranty departments.",5.0
32,"January 17, 2011","My experience with Ron Luttrell  was amazing!! The vehicle i purchased had some problems initially, but Ron made everything work out great. I locked my keys in car and he personally unlocked it. He is a valuable employee to have!! I would recommend Peter's to anyone strictly based on my experience with Ron.
