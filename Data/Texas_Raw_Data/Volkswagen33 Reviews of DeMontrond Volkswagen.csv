Mr. Geter knows a lot about Volkswagen vehicles, he helped me and showed so many cars till I found the one I want.
Ms. Ables is very attentive and a hard worker. 
If you are in the market for a Volkswagen, visit DeMontrond Volkswagen in Houston they will make sure that you leave happy with a car too. ",5.0
1,"February 23, 2020","Very poor. Brought in daughters 2010 Beetle for check engine light and oil leak, the first of January. Took care of engine light and after 800 dollars of flushes told my wife needs a new vacuum pump to repair oil leak. Almost March and the part to fix is on back order. Time to get part seems excessive. Charged money for a lot of preventive maintenance that could have waited, meanwhile necessary maintenance still not completed and daughter at college with no car the last two months. ",1.0
2,"November 17, 2019","AWFUL SERVICE !!! I love VOLKSWAGEN BUT THIS DEALERSHIP IS PURE xxxx! 

They’re service is the very worst !! They take your money easily but don’t service you as they’re supposed to. They take your money then go home and make you wait til next week so you can come and pick up your parts. 

NOBODY TELLS THE CUSTOMER AT WHAT TIME PARTS CLOSES BECAUSE Is not as important as charging the customer!! 

IM FLIPPING ISH RIGHT NOW BECAUSE I CANT FIX MY CAR BECAUSE OD THEIR BAD SERVICE AND LACK OF INFORMATION TO THE CUSTOMER. 
DONT GO HERE, GO TO DEMONTROND THEYRE FAR AWAY BUT I ENSURE YOU ERIC AND HIS STAFF WOULD TAKE VERY GOOD CARE OF YOU. 

VOLKSWAGEN I LOVE YOU BUT THIS PLACE IS DESTROYING YOUR REPUTATION SERVICE WISE !! ",1.0

4,"April 27, 2019","Ok so a simple oil change with an appointment with wait selected takes 3-4 hours on multiple attempts, an ac inspection is 2-3weeks out for months now. Not to mention I had an ac service included in this trip, when I arrived to waste my day they let me know I will have to come back and finish wasting my life because there is no ac tech available at this time even thought it was scheduled already..I travel for a living, come and go at the companys will so weeks away just does not happen. I bought the car here with the service included. That will never happen again as they just laughter about it and tell me ""it does not help that they have kids working for them"".... I am not laughing when I waste half my day off for an oil change.. makes vw look bad. Yet another vw dealer that has a horrible service department.. ",1.8
5,"March 22, 2019","I have been with Volkswagen ever since I bought my 2010 Super Beetle.  Every person on the Service Desk,,Wayne, Daniel, Jonathan, and especially Jessica, has been consistent in their information sharing and recommendations.  They hunt for the best deals for service work and, if I come in with a coupon or rebate item, they share whether it is a workable credit.item.  I've had two body shop trips for damage to the front end.  My girl comes back in top shape and freshly washed and swept..  I had received a coupon in the mail from a service center, shared the information with my folks at DeMontrond, and learned that they could give me a better price for the service.  Wish they had a pickup truck, as well.",4.6
6,"September 13, 2018","Dealer will not honor agreed upon final pricing since they increased the price of the vehicle on the website.  This appears to be a classic bait and switch.  Even with the final agreed price in writing, they refuse.  Therefore, any price online, even if not negotiated and you understand the fine print, will not be honored.  Be warned.",1.0
7,"April 13, 2018","Since 2013 I have only received maintenance on my vehicle from DeMontrond VW at North Freeway. NO MORE.  They recommend service for which they had performed on my car on Aug. 16, 2016. Went to an independent VW auto shop and was told the repair needed was totally different and less expensive.
Maybe because I am a senior citizen they thought I would not recognize their scam.",1.2

9,"December 12, 2017","I bought a brand new model 2018 SEL Premium Tiguan in August from DeMontrond Volkswagen in Houston, TX.  There were two exterior weather strips for front windshield appears to be defective. One of them, the tip was broken and the other one was having a hole on it. 

Prior to sign contract of the purchase on that day, Mr. Adam and Mr. Burger agreed to replace it by 2 brand new weather strips completely free. They told my wife and me that they will have Mr. Daniel Natoli, Service Department Manager to place special order and Mr. Daniel Natoli will contact me for the ETA of the weather strips. I have been following up with Mr. Daniel Natoli, Mr. Burger, and Mr. Adam for 4 months by phone and text but they did not fulfill their promise to contact me of the ETA at all especially Mr. Daniel Natoli was very rudely passes all my follow up calls to his foot soldier - Mr. Brian to handle my all follow up calls. 

From this situation, you can see their business ethic in their business practice should you do business with them from the Sales platform to the Service platform. If I have had the issue resolved before Christmas in the year of 2017, I will gladly update it here. 

Update On January 3rd, 2018 As Follow:
What a combat from the sales floor experience to the service experience as a new customer at DeMontrond Volkswagen in Houston, TX.  Finally, my brand new model 2018 SEL Premium Tiguan has the two exterior weather strips for front windshield to be replaced today. I am very happy of it as my late Birthday (Mid August of 2017), Thanksgiving (Nov of 2017), Christmas (Dec of 2017), and New Year (January of 2018) gift.

10,"November 20, 2017","Had been car shopping for about a month, did not have very well experiences in comparison to DeMontrond Volkswagen. Came in that day and came out with my beautiful car that day. Andres Reyes was very informative, anything asked he answered himself as best as he could. I really appreciated this!!! He was polite and never pushy. Would definitely recommend going to him at this dealership. Financing went good as will with Diego. ",4.8
11,"August 23, 2017","Went in looking for a new Jetta. Jasmine was a huge help, she wasn't pushy what so ever. I was looking for a Manual transmission which aren't very popular so they're not exactly easy to find. She was able to locate one and did everything to make the delivery as smooth as possible. ",5.0
12,"August 03, 2017","My experience here was awesome! I had my doubts just because Toyota, Hyundai, and even Honda turned me down because I as a 18 yr old college student didn't have credit! My last try was DeMontrond Volkswagen. I was really doubtful but I still  went in & there is when i  met Jasmine Johnson! She was really helpful & bubbly! She explained the lifetime warranty and an idea of my monthly payments. She showed me the variety of car selections they had, she was really awesome! It came down for to choose a white or gray Jetta.... I got the  Gray Volkswagen Jetta TSI! Best Buy Ive made! They gave me the opportunity to do a smart buy wish Is like a lease but then like financing. You have 4 yrs to pay a certain amount and 6 months before your contract is over you get to decide if you want to keep the car or trade it in. They also pay off your last 6 month IF you decide to trade it the car. If you decide to stay with the vehicle  you'd have a small amount to pay off the car for a year or two. I really appreciate DeMontrond for giving me a chance to not only get my first car but to help me build credit! Jasmine Johnson explained everything to me and was a great help! Also, franklyn adames was the best! He explained everything to me & was a great finance consultant! He knows what he's doing! Awesome employees! Also, the times I've gone to pick up paper work & jasmine hasn't been able to be there, Andres Reyes has been there! He's also a hard worker & a really cool guy! I recommend these 3 people here if you're ever are looking to buy at this dealership! Great job managers, for hiring them! ",5.0
13,"July 26, 2017","I have taken my 2002 Jetta here since 2013. Not only is the personnel knowledgeable about their brand (both in the shop and on the service drive) but they make taking your car to the dealership a worry-free process. Even when I've come in at busy times, I've been greeted by genuine people, and I know my car is always in great hands when I drop it off. This service department has worked around my schedule to get my car looked at and the Advisor/Manager has always kept me updated on the progress of the vehicle. The prices you pay are unbeatable, especially considering that it is certified work, Since bringing my car here, I will never take it anywhere else. ",5.0

15,"May 18, 2017","After working a deal from DeMontrond Volkswagen and receiving a price on a new 2017 VW GTI SE that was approved by the sales manager I drove 45 minutes to purchase my new car.
After arriving the price on the car was now much higher than they quoted me in my txt messages as was the amount they offered for my trade in.
With a difference of about 4-5K in the total deal I had to drive back home 45 minutes without a new car.

A real shame that they would not stand behind their written offer. ",2.2
16,"April 20, 2017","Took my Jetta in on 4/12/2017 because of a check engine light 7 days later I can no longer afford my rental I call because they never call and tell them that's it I'm picking my car up today! Dwayne calls me to let me no my car needs 1800.00 more to be fixed,,!i told him I don't have that you have had my car for 7 days and you just found this out?well 846.00 plus my rental 505.00 total 1351.00 my car is the same as when I went there on 4/12/2017 not 1 difference! All they did was take my money I wish I had read the reviews before I went there!",1.3
17,"April 03, 2017","I took my 2013 GLI in for service.  When I picked it up, my charger and charging cord were missing.  I know that whole don't leave any valuables crap, however, everything in any ones car is valuable to them.  So that whole thing is BS.  I told them about the missing item, let someone search my car so they could confirm it was missing.  They of course went to the service bay but it was not there.  Then the manager comes out and tells me, quote, ""it is your fault that someone stole this from your car"".  Too bad I cannot leave a zero. ",1.6
18,"February 28, 2017","I scheduled a service for my 2015 CC, which I recently got through swapping a lease, so this was my first service experience with VW. Other brands I've had experience with are BMW, Lexus, Infinity and GM. I want to thank the service technician who was dealt with me. When I scheduled the appointment, I indicated I would wait, but first he said a service like that would take at least 2 hours, then I had to faulty interior lights, so that could even take more hours and that I shouldn't wait. Bottom line, he didn't inspire at all trust. Things got to vague and awkward, so I just left and took my car. Now that I read all the reviews online, I am so glad I could walk away. I took my car to another place and what a difference! ",1.6
19,"December 15, 2016",From the first second we walked in the door they were there to help us we didn't have to find someone to help Andre's our car salesman and Mike his manager bent over backwards to get us in the car that we wanted and have been there to help every since no matter what we needed it is the best experience we have had and we have been looking for new cars for quite a while,5.0
20,"September 18, 2016",They have been lying to me from the day one. They don't care about their customers. Their Manager is an absolute crook! He will do anything to get you sign some initial papers so they can check your credit score. After that's done they would now just start playing with numbers. Nothing adds up or makes sense. If you ask for a fine print of the deal they won't even hand it out to you. Unethical business policy. I'll do whatever I can to make sure people avoid these crooks at any cost. ,1.0
21,"August 09, 2016","Purchased 2015 Passat in early 2015. Dealership screwed up paperwork and undercharged us; then called in a panic and overnighted revised paperwork next day to sign and overnight. NOTHING OFFERED FOR THEIR MISTAKE AND MY TIME TO CHANGE AND OVERNIGHT! After charging $275 for a 1.5-Hour, 30K maintenance appointment, the service department opted to leave off the brake fluid reservoir cap so my wife could drive 60 miles round trip (In Houston Traffic) the next day to have it fix. AGAIN, NOTHING OFFERED FOR THEIR MISTAKE; NOT EVEN A REQUESTED PHONE CALL CONCERNING THE ISSUE.

Overall, I suggest buying cars from a different dealership.  From personal experience I know of two DeMontrond dealerships with poor service departments.",1.0
22,"June 30, 2016","My wife's car got totaled and we didn't have full coverage because it was so old. 

Finding ourselves needing another vehicle I swallowed hard and started a process that I have always hated.

She took a shine to the VW Jetta so I reached out to Demontrond because they were close to my house and office. 

I ended up dealing with Adam Culbertson and man, what a PHENOMENAL experience with both him and the dealership.

No hard sale, very matter-of-fact negotiations, so refreshing. 

""Can you sell it to me for this price?""
 Yep. 
""Can I get it in this color?""
 Sure. 
""Ok can we get TT&L included?"" 
Haha...c'mon man. You know I can't do that. 
""Fair enough. Will I have to sit in the dealership forever?""
Nope..tell me when you want to come by, I'll have paperwork ready.

After a handful of emails, a couple quick phone calls and 15 minutes at the dealership I drove our new car home.

The service is spectacular. They keep us posted on when the manufacturer's schedule requires maintenance and we have no problem getting appointments that fit our schedule. What's more, because there's another Demontrond near my wife's office she can often drop it off on her way in and pick it up on her way home.

I have HORROR stories about so many other Houston dealerships but Demontrond VW is awesome. 

I'm sorry there are some other negative reviews on here...can't speak to those obviously but my experience is top notch.

Ask for Adam!! ",5.0
23,"January 08, 2016","Only reason for one start is you cant give a ZERO!
Went here to avoid driving across town to have a service done on my VW, they did not do all the services i paid for and when i went back to let them know about it they just made up stories about how i didn't know what all they had done to my car. I have owned and driven my VW for a year now and know that brake dust builds up on the front wheel on my VW like any other vehicle on the road for that matter, but when i showed up and tried to show him that my tires haven't been rotated he tried to convince me it had been done and that VW`s don't show the same brake dust on the front wheels as every other vehicle on the road and tried to convince me that they show brake dust on the rear tires!!
I made the mistake of allowing them to do a balance and alignment on my car hoping this was a one time thing but i was proven wrong again. I had lost my wheel key for the lugs, and asked the service writer to replace them with regular lugs when he did the service so i didn't have to keep up with another key, when i got the bill they were trying to charged me $45 to replace the lugs that they had to remove to balance the tires anyways!!! After 15 min of arguing they removed the charge and the tires are still in the same place as they were when i drove my car into there shop 3 weeks ago, haven never been rotated even though they took my 24.99 for doing the job.
I would suggest everyone that does business with them look your bill over before handing over the payment and make sure the work has been done and they are not double charging you for the work!!!",1.2
24,"July 07, 2015","I had a horrible experience when I came to the dealership back in the beginning of 2014 and never got a call back from NOONE! Came back to the dealership on 7/3/2015 and Kieth  Muhammand approached me and I told him what car was looking for and he told me to come back on the next day which was the fourth of July. I came on the fourth and kieth  Muhammand had a salesman to take over when I explained my situation with me totaling my last vehicle and I told him if they could not get the deal done with a decent rate do not pull my credit or waste my time, end result they pulled for hard inquires on my credit and sat there for over two hours. Do not waste your time here. I called the general manger 2 times and got nowhere there is ",1.0
25,"March 25, 2014","Demontrond - VW. I have a 2010 VW CC, and it is certified. First and foremost, buy a certified car. These vehicles have a lot of gadgets, and with a lot of ""bells and whistles"" comes a lot of opportunity for them to break. I have had my car in the shop four times over the past year, for vaious minor issues (fuel pump, radio issues, master brake cylinder, etc.). I bought my car at a different VW dealership on the south side of Houston that has not been helpful at all with the issues I have experienced. Daniel at Demontrond VW service has been by far the most helpful service advisor I HAVE EVER DEALT WITH. Ever. When I have vague (at best) descriptions about what is going on with my car, he takes it - sets me up with a loaner, and completely does his due dilligence to get it fixed - and everything so far has been covered by warranty with a small $50.00 deductible. They are extremely pleasant to deal with, quick, and punctual. 

As a matter of fact, although I will not buy another VW, I have been so impressed with the service center at Demontrond, I am planning on trading my car in for something a little more standard (Ford, GMC, etc.). The service has been so good at Demontrond that I will be buying another certified used car from the Demontrond group. Give them a try, and make your appointment with Daniel. He is the best, but the other guys are great too. Just try it - you won't be sorry.

26,"November 20, 2013",I guess DeMontrond has all the business they need. I requested an appointment for a state inspection and oil change via their web site and never received an answer. A few days later I called them. Got transferred to Brandon's voice mail and made a verbal request for service. No return call; had to find someone else. I won't be bothering DeMonstrond again.,1.0
27,"August 28, 2013","Lying, deceitful, switched jetta on sales agreement with lesser featured. Finance showed agreed upon numbers on monitor but printed out higher numbers. Finance arbitrarily tacked an additional 1290.00 onto the sales price of the car. Finance added more than the basic extended warranty despite being told the other features were not wanted. Finance lied about financing terms...verbally said it was one way while it was written in different terms. Told it would take 4 weeks (approximately) before I could access the account. Was asked to rate the dealership right away or VW wouldn't pay them. 
Once account was accessible, the addons and increased pricing was evident, along with terms of financing different than what we had discussed. 
Back to dealership and requested ALL add-ons be removed along with reimbursing the additional 1290.00 and the additional tax paid on that 1290.00. Cancellation form has all of the numbers. Finance said the additional 1290.00 tacked on was for a package called Titanium (which I was unfamiliar with). Actually, Titanium was one of the addons and was priced at approx. 700-800. 
Through the BBB, much of the monies on that cancellation form have been reimbursed (paid to the finance company) but finance charges were taken out, about 50.00, so far). Also, Demontrond still owes approximately 600.00 from the agreed upon cancellation form. I've sent copies of all paperwork to the BBB. Next step, consumer advocates...e.g., Emily Akin. ",1.6
28,"May 18, 2013","My VW had an ongoing problem that a few other places claimed to find and fix but they did not.  In desperation, I gave DeMontrond a try based on the recommendation of a friend.  I am so glad I did!  They found the true source of the problem  - quickly - and while they did have to order the part, it arrived promptly and was fixed - for good!  And the price wound up being less than what the other places charged!  I'm normally apprehensive when it comes to dealerships but I will continue to take my car there.  I even pass another VW dealership and a bunch of mom and pop type shops on the way.  The advisor was great, the estimate was pretty accurate . . . I am very pleased!  ",4.6
29,"February 16, 2013","I purchased a used vehicle about three weeks ago.  The car's appearance was in pretty good shape, and it had very low mileage.  This is the reason I purchased the vehicle.  The salesman said that they would clean up the car so I could pick it up later.  When I picked it up, the car had obviously not been touched since I had made the deal (when I first saw the car, there was a rag in the trunk; it was still there when I picked it up).  On top of it, after I took delivery the salesman informed me that they only had one key.  Yes, those keys that cost $300, plus reprogramming.  I guess I should have asked when we were negotiating the purchase price, but then again, who asks about keys when you are buying a car? You always expect two keys.  Few days later, I sent an email to the salesman if the dealership would agree to split the cost of another set of keys.  To date, the salesman has not responded to my email.  I definitely would not recommend this dealership.",2.2
