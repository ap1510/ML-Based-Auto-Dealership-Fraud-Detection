2,"March 14, 2020","I have been a loyal customer to Momentum VW in Upper Kirby since 2017. Brought my 2017 CC Rline for service along with fixing the window rattering issue in September, 2019 and was put in wait list of loaner car by service consultant. Mr. Artif. I was told the availability of the loaner car will be in the final week of November or 1st week of December, 2019. 4 months after September 2019, I did not receive any calls or emails in regard to my loaner car so that I called to the dealership. Service consultant, Mr. Artif told me that the wait list had been discontinued since December of 2019. Because of the new management with the new system in 2020 at the VW Upper Kirby dealership, all the old loaner wait list of 2019 did not carry over to 2020. Immediately afterward, the service consultant, Mr. Artif transferred me directly to the 800 number to book a loaner car reservation without providing me an apology. At the 3rd week of January, 2020, I was scheduled to pick up my loaner car at the dealership in order to have my CC window's rattling noice to be fixed. Unfortunately, the VW Upper Kirby dealership did not have any loaner car available for me so that I was sent to the nearby Enterprise Rent A Car location for my scheduled loaner car. Upon arrival to the Enterprise Rent A Car, I was being asked to put a car rental deposit in regardless of whether VW Upper Kirby dealership sent me for loaner car purpose. I immediately called to the service consultant Mr. Artif of VW Upper Kirby dealership to resolve the situation because I am not renting the car for pleasure initially and I was sent to pick up my loaner car while my CC is in the service for several days. Should it be my fault that VW Upper Kirby dealership did not have it's own loaner car available for me on the day I was scheduled for pick up? Why do I need to put a deposit to a car from Enterprise Rent A Car which I am not renting it for pleasure initially by contacting Enterprise Rent A Car myself originally? I was asked to return to the VW Upper Kirby dealership. Upon my arrival, I talked to the service consultant, Mr. Artif and he promised me to escalate my situation to the newbie manager, Mr. Scott in order to have in house loaner car for me without having to use their 3rd party business. Now, it has been 2 months since the 3rd week of January, 2020 (today is March 14th) and I still am not being contacted by the service consultant, Mr. Artif or newbie manager Mr. Scott from VW Upper Kirby dealership. In my case, you can clearly see how is the current business ethic of VW Upper Kirby dealership in the new management of 2020. Are you actually being valued as a value customer? Where is their promising word? Should you seek for somewhere else for your next car service? ",1.0
3,"January 26, 2020","Jason Richardson went above and beyond to help me find the perfect car I was looking for!  After he showed me several cars at the dealership, I settled on the exact one I wanted. Adam made the final purchase possible, and I drove my new car home on the same day. Thank you Jason and Adam!",5.0

5,"January 21, 2020","Jesus made the transaction as painless as a car negotiation can be.  There were no surprises when I arrived to make the purchase, no last minute additional fees.  The ""out the door"" price was exactly what we agreed.  Jesus also fully explained the cars features before I left.  I will recommend Momentum (and especially Jesus) to others.",4.8
6,"November 17, 2019", Ashone Johnson thank you for everything. Love my car. Easy process sent me all the information I needed. I truly appreciate him and Momentum VW.,5.0
7,"September 30, 2019",Called concerning a used car they just listed. Salesman put me on hold while he went and personally made sure the car was available. Made an appointment to test drive the car that afternoon and was greeted promptly when I walked in. Casual atmosphere and people made the experience worth the drive.,5.0
8,"July 05, 2019",I purchased a 2019 Jetta SEL Premium. The sales team was knowledgeable and friendly. They gave me a great deal on my trade-in and purchase. I would highly recommend purchasing from this dealership.,5.0
9,"January 05, 2019","Purchased a 2019 Tiguan SEL Premium from Momentum even though I live in Austin.  Did all dealer price quotes and negotiations on out the door price via email and Momentum beat the best local dealer price by ~$1200 so it was worth a drive to Houston for the purchase.  The dealership looks first rate and the staff are professional.  I ran into a couple issues which I realized only after taking delivery of the vehicle and driving back to Austin.  First was with the paperwork having the incorrect VIN but this was corrected quickly via email and FedEx.  The second was with the Tiguan containing an incorrect owner's manual in the glovebox, this was also handled quickly via email and FedEx.  Overall the dealership was unbeatable on price, provided great feedback during the info gathering stage and provided great support to resolve issues that arose post-sale.  I did not use their service center so have no feedback there",5.0
10,"July 24, 2018","I recently purchased a 2018 VW Atlas from Momentum.  I used a process identical to the last 3 cars I purchased successfully, sending around a list of identical vehicles from 6 regional dealers and asking each dealer to give me their best one-shot drive off quote via email.  Some dealers are reluctant to give up on the old business model, but I was looking to get the best price, cash deal, no trade-in with minimum time wasted in the dealership listening to traditional sales pitches.

Jose Maldanado gave me a very competitive price in writing quickly.  Once I told him he had won the bidding process and I would definitely buy from him, he held the car for me for several days.  I was in and out of the dealership in about 45 minutes this past Saturday AM.  Dana was perceptive that I didn't want to hear about all of the typical credit manager margin enhancers and he didn't waste my time trying to sell them to me.

Momentum gained a profitable sale with minimal sales resource effort and a happy customer.  I gained a great new car.  Thanks Momentum.  ",5.0

28,"September 13, 2017","I would have given this dealership 0 stars if I could. We had made an appointment to see a vehicle later on the same day when we called. The salesman asked if I wanted to set up an appointment to see the car and he would have it ready for us to test drive. However, upon arrival we'd found out that the vehicle we were interested in was sold. As we walked in at the appointed time after having driven for almost an hour through Houston rush hour traffic, Joey started rummaging through the papers on his desk and telling us that he ""was just looking up our information"" to give us a phone call about  what happened. To our question why the car was sold if he had customers, meaning us, coming by appointment to see it, he said that he was truly sorry, as he was.And that this had happened before...We did not know what to say to that. They make appointments, but it really does not mean that the vehicle he/she has made an appointment to see will be there. I guess appointments don't really mean anything and sounds like this is their common practice at this dealership...What sense does this make? Of course, the manager said he was also really sorry and offered help with finding similar vehicle; however, at the end, he did not even asked for our names or contact information. None of them did... We were very frustrated, as we wasted our entire evening in traffic to and from the dealership only to find out that no one really cared about their customers. And worst of all that they really don't care. Apologies without actions mean nothing. Make an appointment if you can elsewhere, who knows maybe they will have your car ready and waiting. Pass on these guys.",1.0
29,"September 12, 2017",Steve was very helping with helping us pick out our Atlas.  He was very informative and knowledgeable abt our vehicle. We are excited to work with Steve in the future. ,5.0
30,"August 22, 2017","I recently traded in my 2013 BMW 3-Series for a brand new 2018 VW Tiguan and my advisor Ashone helped to facilitate the transition and to ease any reservations I had about making the switch to VW. The new 2018 Tiguan is beautiful, sleek and absolutely perfect for me. I've gotten so many compliments and questions about it since I purchased it three days ago! Ashone has been helping our family for years and we have never had any problems with visits to the dealership. He helped my parents in 2013 to purchase a new Jetta and they recently transitioned to a gorgeous new red Passat this year. Ashone also helped my sister buy her first car last year, a sporty silver VW Golf TSI, which she completely fell in love with. I will definitely be recommending Momentum VW in upper Kirby and will tell all my friends, co-workers and family to ask for Ashone. I look forward to staying in the VW family! :) ",5.0

32,"August 11, 2017",I would definitely recommend this location to anyone looking for a car. I am a first time buyer in college and the process wasn't hard at all. Rashad helped me find a great car with low mileage in my price range without costing me an arm and a leg a month. I had been car shopping for a few days and none of the salesmen I believe were as comforting as Rashad. They took care of my first monthly payment and tinted my car for free. I am very pleased with my purchase. Thanks Momentum VW !,5.0

41,"May 26, 2017",The salesman Enrico Wood was very helpful.  We did the entire transaction over the phone and internet.  I waited in my own office working while they churned away their numbers and gave me a competitive price.  Total wait time at the dealership was one hour in and out with a new car.  I could not believe it!! Best experience I've ever had.  Neither the alesman or the finance guy we're pushy.  They understood how important time is for their customers.,5.0
42,"May 20, 2017","I just had the worst experience ever at this dealership! I came in on 5/16 
 around 6pm looking to purchase a vehicle 10k and under for my daughter who is graduating high school on June 2. I looked at the 2013 Kia Soul with 43k miles. I was told that the vehicle had not been inspected and was not ready to be sold. I test drove the vehicle and inspected the car as best as I could.  I told my sales guy that I was very interested in purchasing the car I just needed my husband to test drive the car for his approval. He told me I could come back tomorrow 5/17 and by that time the car would have been inspected and we could talk about a deal for the car. I called my financing company and got approval for the car only to get there today to find out that the vehicle was being sold to someone else. I spoke with 2 managers and asked why the vehicle was being sold to someone else when I had just made an offer the night before and the car supposedly needed to be inspected. I was told that I should have put money down on the car I told both managers that my sales guy did not tell me that I had to put anything down. I spoke with my sales guy at least three times and he never told me I had to put any money down. My sales guy said in front of both his mangers that he dropped the ball and made this mistake of not letting me know that I had to put money down on the car in which i had no problem doing.. So instead of both managers trying to make me the customer who put the first offer in on the car, financing ready to go, and spent 2 days, and 4 hours of my time.. they sold it to the other customer who spent less than 2 hours in the store. To make things worse one of the managers had the nerve to ask me if I wanted to look at another car. Really..... I came into your  dealership ready to buy a car for my daughter only to watch the car being sold to someone else right in front of my face and waste my time.",1.3

57,"March 19, 2017","After having experienced two other VW dealerships in Houston and receiving horrific service I filled out a electronic slip on momentum VW's site. The very next morning I was contacted by Cole Babieaux (yes I had to check his card to make sure I spelled it right).

From the moment of the first call I was blown away with the fantastic service. We talked for a few minutes and mentioned the car I choose online and my financial background and verify. It wasn't 25 minutes after the phone call I got another one from him with numbers of my monthly payment information. As soon as I visited the dealer that afternoon he greeted me at the door and even notice my girlfriend who was with me. Which every other dealership failed to do. He sat us down and talked to us about everything to double check and let us go see the car that I choose online. He had the car already washed and everything with the floor mats out and everything.

Once the paperwork was signed he went through the car with me explaining how to do certain things and how to use the touch screen and all of the other gadgets. I couldn't believe the service I got it was flawless. He stayed after closing on his time to show me these things and I cannot say enough good things for Cole and his team. I will not go anywhere but to his dealer and to use him for any future VW cars purchased. I left the dealer smiling and ready to enjoy my new ride.",5.0

Quite frankly the last straw along with various previously disputed invoices and charges (items listed that clearly were not addressed), I will recommend no one to this dealership for service or in general.",1.0
112,"November 11, 2015","My experience here is awful. I went to the shop on Friday morning to for regular maintenance and engine check. When they told me my battery failed and have to replace the catalyst converter, I agreed to the service and they admitted to give me 10% off from 2547 to 2274, and they said they would make it done tomorrow (Saturday) morning so I could get my car after Lunch. HOWEVER, I called the shop Sat at 1pm., my service management didnt pick up my call, then I called the shop, they told me the service would be closed at 2 so the earliest time i could get my car would be MONDAY! i am so disappointed and i knew they would not keep their promise, I HAVE TO RENT a car for Monday! I called them on Monday afternoon again, my service manager said the part would be at shop on Tuesday!  Again, I have to take taxis on Tuesday for going out in the morning. Finally, Tuesday afternoon, they called me the car was ready to go (they told me at 2, i was busy till 8, so i could only go to collect my car on Wed), and they picked me up from my place to the shop on Wed morning, which is good. THE BAD experience is not over! On the receipt, they didn't give me the 10% off as they promised, the price was 2547, without any discount! And my service manager was not even there, I did not know who to argue on the price, and I felt so bad about everything in the shop! Why they just could not keep their original promise? They told me they could get it fixed on the next day and I have a 10% off, so I signed the service agreement, but they definitely do the opposite! Will never come back to this shop.  I am new to Houston just 2 months, first time going to a dealer, feel so bad about the whole process. ",1.4
113,"June 29, 2015","I just purchased a used GTI from AutoNation this weekend and it needed a small part replaced.  I am new to VWs, so I thought I would call around to the Houston dealerships to do some price comparisons.  I am looking for the cord that suspends the rear cargo cover from the hatch.  

I called two different Momentum dealerships (Richmond and Clear Lake) and got two very different quotes for the same part: $25 at one and $30 at the other.  Now, five dollars may not seem like a great deal of money, but when considering the difference in percentage of total cost it is quite significant!  

However, the worst part of this little experiment, and the deciding factor in where I will do business in the future, is that the same part at Archer VW is only $19.58!  Do the math for yourself and decide which dealership is gouging its customers.",1.0
114,"April 15, 2015","Bill the service rep was friendly, polite and professional.  That is the ONLY good thing I can say about their service deparment.  In November we brought my 2009 Tiguan in because the check engine light was on and oil was leaking and were told the oil pressure had blown all the seals in my engine.  $3,500 later they told me my car was fixed.  Within a week an alarm started going off saying ""STOP ENGINE Oil Pressure See Manual"" I immediately took my car back in and after almost a week was told there was nothing wrong with my car and the alarm wouldn't go off when it was with them.  Within the next few weeks it had gone off three more times (they were aware it was going off, I had called them immediately and they did not seem overly concerned).  I brought it back in and after two weeks was told it was a sensor ($100). By now it was January.  I picked it up and the alarm went off again within a week.  I notified them that I would be bringing it back in, even though I was hearing from them they had no idea what to do or why it was happening.  Before I could get it back it broke down on me and I had to get it towed in.  After a $130 diagnostic fee they told me my timing belt needed to be replaced and it was completely separate from the oil pressure alarm which I could not believe.  We took it to another mechanic (that we knew and trusted) and were told he replaced the timing belt ($1,600) but he didn't think that was the problem because there were metal shavings in the oil.  Which means the real problem all along and what the alarm kept saying was that there was an OIL PRESSURE PROBLEM!!  But the thing is, once you have metal shavings in your oil your car is pretty much done and believe me it was.  It was February and after 3 months of telling VW Momentum that something was off with my oil pressure my car was worthless and they did absolutely NOTHING to make it right.  I made a complaint with VWCares and they replied within a day that the dealership would take no responisbility for the work they did on my car.  I used to love my car and VW and they could have made it right, maybe offer to fix it, give me a decent trade in value, ANYTHING, but they did NOTHING.  So please do yourself a favor and stay away from this dealership because they do NOT stand behind their work.  ",2.0
115,"February 17, 2015",I walked in and bought a used VW. I was very satisfied with that part of the experience. But then I had to take the car back for some added features I purchased. They no longer cared. They had their commission and lost interest. I had to inconvenience myself to take the car back a second time only to have it not satisfactory once again. They still didn't care. That made an effort to fix the problem but it was obvious their heart wasn't into it. ,1.2

121,"January 01, 2011","Let me start by saying that I have purchased 3 vehicles from them since 2005 Jetta and 2 Passats and 1 Jetta from Archer VW. The problems at the service department at Momentum is well know from other dealers around town. The service Manager Derek is incredibly unprofessional and must be related to the owner somehow because he is truly worthless. But more than him it is the culture at momentum to sell vehicles first, service is not even a concern and it has been this way since I bought my first Jetta in 2005. Here are 3 examples of backwards way they treat customers: 

1- September 2007 - my check engine light came on after 6,000 miles and I called the dealership immediately. She told me that it would be 3-4 weeks until they could fit me in...for a check engine light. I complained adn she said it was probably nothing anyways so just don't drive on it too much and it should be fine until the appointment!! I drove straight to the dealership and demanded that they look at it. They said it was probably the gas cap and unscewed it, then screwed it back on and told me to drive for 10-15 miles and see if it stops. It didn't it was a faulty sensor.

2- July 2008 Took my car in for a warranty service and they had to order a part so they gave my wife a loaner vehicle. She picked it up and on her way to work was pulled over for improper registration and tags on the vehicle. Then they told me to drive it back to the dealership and they would look into it. Eventually they agreed to bring another vehicle and exchange it. On teh way home the wheel well wall came apart and started dragging on the road in the middle of rush hour traffic. Once again they wanted me to use my insurance to tow it to the dealership. 

3- Today - got a free loaner car because when I was last in to have my antenna and lumbar motor replaced they messed up my trunk latch plus I had a warranty recall on the transmission. I got the loaner car and drove it 18 miles to my home, parked it in the garage. When I was returning the vehicle i had a flat tire. I called the dealership and they said I was responsible for it so I should take it to discount tire or something. Discount couldn't fix it because it was damage to the interior sidewall. They charged me $130 for a new tire, because it was my responsibility???? He said it was a cut and I said it was a blowout and that we would have to agree to disagree. I paid the fee knowing that this is the absolute last dollar I will ever pay to momentum...ever. I like my VW Passats, but it seems that it has to be taken in for service (non-maintenance) 2-3 times a year. $35K on a car deserves some respect and service. I have been patient and forgiving but this is the last straw. For the record Ken Reese, the service agent has been better than most at customer service, but the culture of the dealership overshadows his hard work.

I also experienced issues with their lack of attention to detail during the sale and the severe lack of follow up once the vehicle was sold.  ",1.0
122,"October 20, 2010","Lots of hidden fees.  They cannot sell a car for the price listed.  I know there is TT&L but an additional 1300 in fees is unacceptable.

They told me that was done and when I asked why I can not see the 7 pin connector they said it was installed but they must have not installed the plug. I mean they came up with some interesting lies. However when I needed to tow an RV trailer after a year or so I found out the tow package installed was an after market and to install the 4 pin connector they spliced into the car wires. . . . AVOID this dealer at all costs. 
VW's customer service was also not adequate to correct this issue and now I have a 50k POS that is nothing what I paid for.",1.6

While the transport company came to pick up the vehicle, he had to wait, because they lost the keys and had to make a new one.This dealer is a joke, how do they stay in business?

125,"May 11, 2009","N-O spells NO! This car dealership should be SHUT DOWN never to re-open ever again! We recently purchased a Toureg with Jersey Village and since we drove this car off the lot, it has been a piss-poor experience since then. I only WISH we would have read these reviews before purchasing there.

It started off with the ""We owe List."" Our salesman, Josh, agreed to drop off a loaner car to my husband's job and bring in the Toureg for service on a few items that were on the ""We Owe List"". We didn't hear from Josh all that week after several phone calls. After speaking to Val, the General Manager, who was inconsiderate of the fact that we lived on the opposite side of town and it would be too inconvenient for us to bring the Toureg in, we finally agreed to bring in the car on Friday to have it serviced. That's when we met Pete, our service rep. Pete said that the car should be ready by 5:00 on Friday...but here we are today, Monday, just wrapping up service at 6:00 p.m. 

Our 2 biggest complaints: 1. The driver side's window makes a whistling sound that implies that he window seal is not tight. But the service department has tried to convince us that it's normal for the Toureg to make that sound. So they're not trying to fix it.
2. The driver's side-mirror has tape holding it together! Yes, you read right! We noticed that there is a puncture in the blinker light that the previous owner must have tried to fix by placing clear tape on it to disguise the broken glass. Well, we just noticed it the day we brought it in for service and made Pete aware of it. We find out today that Val does not want to take care of it.

Needless to say, we are ABSOLUTELY reporting this to the BBB and we will take this wherever it needs to go to ensure another buyer does not have to go through the same nonsense that we've gone through!

126,"April 05, 2009","TERRIBLE service! Bought my car had problems within only a few months of purchase. The service department refused to fix the problems claiming that the car was in an accident (which the car wasn't in any accident under my care)and wasn't covered under warranty. They even pointed out the imperfections which gave them the idea it was in an accident. I bought the car certified and wasn't disclosed of any prior accident, which they claim they didn't know of any(but were quick to point out where it was visible of prior boday damage). AND if you are trading in a vehicle, I advise you to take your plates. The 'I'll take care of everything-attitude' is phony. My old plates ended up getting me a parking ticket in another state a year later. AND PLEASE don't take your car to the Momentum Body shop either. I already spoke with the insurance company about getting ripped off. They billed the insurance company for work and parts that were never properly installed or done. I'm still involved with this headache now..Momentum dealerships are huge in the Houston area...but after a year and a half of these problems and headaches, no matter what deal you think you are getting...you are not.

I took the vehicle elsewhere and they fixed it in about 1 hour at 1/10th of the price quoted me by this dealer- and that was after he had the car for a full two days, and for which I was not given a loaner despite my purchase of a 50K vehicle from them. I will NEVER go there again. I plan to file complaints with the BBB and the state of Texas based on my experiences there over tha past three years. All the service advisors leave after a few months.

I asked for the names of the Service and General managers.  I called both a couple times.  I left a message for the General Manager (it's been 7 days and he still hasn't returned my call!) and I asked to hold for the Service Manager, which I did, FOR ONE HOUR!  Since I had called on my cell phone, I continued to hold while someone drove me to the dealership.  I hung up the phone once I got in the dealership, and would you believe they told me he was gone for the day!  They offered a loaner car as the VERY last option, preferring that I make arrangements for the 2nd day to put my car into the shop.  The service repair was a simple reset of settings that were corrupted when I had my battery replaced.  Their estimate - $300!  DON'T go there!

When I told him not to proceed with repair he said that a 100 dollars investigation fee was due. When I called the day after to go pick up the car he claimed that the inspection still had not been done because the car had no insurance (the insurance certificate was in the glove compartment). I had to find a copy, scan it and send it to him. I finally got the car back one week after I left it. All this for a state inspection.
