0,"June 05, 2020","My experience with Griffith Ford has been both good and bad. Good was how awesome Eric the service representative I dealt with through my repairs. He kept me informed on my truck during the recall and repairs. Bad was their ineptitude to fix my truck. First, they said it was a hose and that if I replaced the hose (for $500) my truck would be running back to normal. Well, after $500 and 2 days later, I drive my truck off the lot and immediately the check engine light comes back on. I take it directly back to them, they look at it for about an hour and say it will cost $4,000 to repair. Long story short, I took it to another mechanic shop they diagnosed the problem for a $300 hose and 1 day my truck is perfect. Will not be taking my business back to Griffith for any service, recall, or when it's time to purchase a new vehicle. This the the perfect experience why people do not want to use dealerships for service repairs, they overcharge you and don't even fix the problem. I could have spent that $500 a lot wiser for my family, during these crazy times.",2.4
1,"February 20, 2020",The ended up charging for repairs that did not fix the vehicle. They refused to make it right. This is hands down one of the worst places to do business within Central Texas. You have so many options why choose this place? Choose a place that appreciates you as a customer and is competent. ,1.0

4,"January 03, 2020",Griffith Ford of San Marcos worked with us on a Ford Expedition and the whole process was amazing. Daniel Gonzales worked out a deal for us and even brought the vehicle to my hometown and made the transaction smooth..thanks Griffith Ford and especially Daniel!!,5.0
5,"December 21, 2019","Took my truck in for an oil change, tire rotation and multi-point check that Ford recommends. Was told I needed, among other things, a transmission shaft seal replacement. I asked how could that be if there was no leak? Anyway, I fell for it and regret it. AFTER the work was done, I had a transmission leak. I took it back and they wanted more money to fix the leak they caused. 

I feel very strongly I was scammed. I am never going back. ",1.4

7,"November 05, 2019","I worked with Vale to possibly purchase a 2019 F150. Once negotiations were turned over to his boss (His name was either Travis or Tony) it went downhill very quickly. He claimed that he came down a certain amount on the price, but when I ran the numbers it wasn't what he claimed. Once negotiations stalled out I got up to leave. Once I got into my truck to leave Vale came out, and said they would take $100 off. I said that's great. Let's start the paperwork. Once we started the paperwork I realized it was still the same offer. I let them know that they needed to update their paperwork to reflect the additional  $100 off, and they said that they couldn't do that and that the previous offer was the best they could do and I should just sign the paperwork. I left again, but forgot my driver's licence, and when I came back to get it they had a new offer with the additional $100 off. I let them know that it was too late at this point, and that I was frustrated with how they tried to lie about the price twice. I ended up buying the same truck for $500 cheaper at Mac Haik in Georgetown. Just make sure you check their offer on their paperwork because it's probably different from what they tell you. ",1.0
8,"October 11, 2019",I purchased a truck Griffith ford on 8/31/19. When sitting in finance guy Charlie Baldwin’s office he put a ford protect warranty in front of me. When I asked him what does it cover he looked me in the eye and said word for word it’s a bumper to bumper warranty like a new car! With that being said I agreed to purchase it. On 9/28/19 the truck left me on the side of the freeway. The truck has only 950 miles since purchased! Have it towed to a ford dealership. The diagnosis is a clogged dpf filter and it will be upwards of 3500.00 to repair! I say wait a minute I have a bumper to bumper warranty. They say no you have an extended warranty and the dpf is not covered! So I immediately call to Griffith. I speak with Kolby the salesman who sold me the truck. He says he will have someone call me. Got a call from Glenn small the service manager. He says oh it should be covered. Well I say it’s not and your employee Charlie Baldwin said it was a bumper to bumper warranty like a new car. He says let me look into it. Well I was not hearing anything so I end up talking to Steve the General manager. He says he is familiar with my situation and he will not be repairing my truck. Even though I was sold a warranty under false pretenses he had no care about the deception that is going on with his employees! Do not do business with these crooks! ,1.0
9,"May 02, 2019","Sal will do and say anything to get you into a car. He made promises that he did not keep.about the paint, and extra car key, and warranty that he continued to ignore me about after I drove off. Terrible dealership that should be ashamed to hire people like that",1.0
10,"May 01, 2019","I was aggravated by the sales tactics of the sales manager Tony, I still wanted the car enough and I got a good enough number that I went forward with the purchase. They corrected the one big item that needed to be done which was an alignment for the car. When I went to pick it up the next day after they had had it for 5-6 hours they hadn't addressed looking at a little trim piece that needed to be tacked down and they didn't have a 2nd key. They didn't give me any flack about giving me the 2nd key they even apologized that it wasn't there ready when I picked up the car. They didn't even bat an eyelash it was like they knew it was standard to until later.  I negotiated with him that I would return to San Marcos the 45-minute drive away from me and get the key made by them for a car wash and a tank of gas. So I made arrangements on a Monday for that Friday five days later. Friday morning starts with a voicemail and a text message stating that their key guy didn't want to come in today. Mind you I already have my appointment and my day set. But I was told if I didn't mind driving up the road a little bit and meeting him, they could get it done today.  Then I received the address , it took me to South Austin about 25 to 30 minute drive, not what I consider just a few minutes up the road. So I get to the address given to me which is the South Austin Nissan new car lot just to find out that I needed to be at the South Austin Nissan used car lot. Which on the other side of interstate, I had passed it on my way to the address that I was given. So now we are 50 minutes into the torture of my day. Key guy was very apologetic he didn't understand how I got the wrong address because he gave very specific instructions to the salesman. Then by text my salesman basically would not take responsibility or apologize for his mistake, until I just flat-out was like mistakes happen just apologized move on don't give me all these explanation of how you're not at fault and you are not responsible and you haven't wasted my time. I don't think I should have to teach adults how to own their mistakes and apologize, that's what I do with my children. Maybe he wasn't taught that by his parents but if nothing else the dealership should have gave him some basic customer service training. So now after about 30 minutes of the key being made and programmed we are now on the way 30 minutes back down to the dealership to get the car washed and the gas tank fill as promised. While waiting for the key I sent a picture of the small trim piece that hadn't been addressed the previous Friday. I figured since they're already like an hour and a half two hours into wasting my day the least they could do was look at it. Get to dealership and immediately they took it back to get washed, it wasn't hardly dirty but I had bug guts that I had a hard time getting out of the grill and I had asked them to address that. I was the next car inline and a few minutes later the salesman came back and told me that the bug stuff had to sit for 10 minutes, warning me that it was going to take more than you know the 20 minutes I would have expected to clean a car. Time kept passing and now we're at the hour and a half mark to get my car washed and my gas tank filled up. I figure they must be looking at that trim piece because it's taking so long, wrong! Insert sales manager Tony, he basically keep saying that he knew nothing about this and it wasn't part of our deal and blah blah blah blah blah. I told him it was the first thing his salesman told me when we were just looking at the car. Salesman didn't promise to fix it he said that he could get that looked at. if they had looked at it and it was something they couldn't repair or fix with some kind of little cheat I wouldn't have pushed to make them do anything. I guess buying a $14,000 car doesn't make me a priority like if I bought a $70,000 truck. Since the sales manager Tony is telling me they're not going to fix it I said okay well I need to get on the road now all of this wasted time is putting me in Friday rush hour 35 Austin to San Antonio traffic. But Tony the sales manager just couldn't shut his mouth, he kept denying not they were doing anything wrong and my response to that was it's not my fault if a salesman doesn't communicate well with his sales manager. It's a shame that they didn't value my time or my business enough to even look at the trim piece. Tony wouldn't shut up and let me just get in my car and leave so now I'm getting aggravated and raising my voice, mostly because I can see that he doesn't want me to raise my voice and make a spectacle. In the end I wished him that every personal business experience for the rest of year that he'd receive the customer service that he had given me. This is when I really offended Tony, which is funny because if he did such a good job of taking care of me why would that be offensive. Then he has the audacity to tell me that I should calm down, I shouldn't be acting like this in front of my children.  I wouldn't have raised my voice and I wouldn't have gotten upset if Tony wouldn't have just kept repeating the same lame excuses over and over and over again. And then he threw in that they were doing me this big favor by giving me a second key. How stupid is this man if he thinks acting like they did was some big favor, while I'm irritated about my wasted and undervalued time and a trim piece that was not looked at. I was irritated when he said he wasn't going to do anything. But then I was trying to get into my car and leave and he just wouldn't leave me alone. I told him it didn't matter how many times he said the same thing, it wouldn't make it true. This is Tony the sales manager, why wasn't he trained how to provide customer service.  I wish that either Hector or Tony or just smart enough to lie and say that it was looked at and they couldn't do anything, then I could have left and not have gotten so upset having Tony badger and mistreat me and follow me from the back of my car to my driver's door. It really is a shame that this is how my car buying experience had to conclude. I took the Griffith Ford letters off of the back of my car even though I wasn't sure if it would damage the paint. Because there's no way I was going to advertise and maybe have somebody do business with this dealership because of me and my car. It is a beautiful car and I don't want Griffith Ford to get any business or recognition or advertising since they are such a horrible dealership that does not care about their customers and they do not remotely know what customer service is. Thankfully I'm not stuck having future contact with with them. I did get a good car for a good price I just had to be mistreated and abused and talked down to the whole buying and picking up a key process.",2.2
11,"March 14, 2019",Took my car in for service and 3 days later found out the car had not even been looked at.  I'm disappointed with the lack of communication from the service advisor.

14,"November 30, 2018","On November 23, 2018 we went to Griffith Ford looking for info on a new car.  We met Adam Rizzo and Colby Kissinger, two very knowledgeable sales people,  We kept them busy for a couple hours answering questions and showing us several vehicles.  We test drove a couple and decided on an ESCAPE. Adam was very helpful, showing us how to use Android Auto and using Bluetooth.  If we had a question, they answered it.  We have been back a few times with other questions and have been taken care of very professionally.

16,"October 31, 2018","So I went in looking for one car. The sales team told me they had it there. They did not. They had a similar one that they tried to sell me for much more. The salesperson kept saying that she liked the smell of the car. It was late and I don't have the greatest sense of smell. It reeked of smoke. I ended up getting the car thinking it was a good deal. I took it home and multiple people commented that it reeked like smoke. Also the trunk shade was missing. When I called about it, the salesperson acted like she had no idea what i was talking about and kept deflecting until I asked to speak to a manager. then she somehow found the missing part. My car was not detailed like they promised and had dust everywhere and things on the dashboard. THEN the finance person called and texted me at work, not giving me any context demanding me to get my credit union to pay them. I feel like I got ripped off.",2.2
17,"October 22, 2018","If I could give a negative amount of stars I would.  When they say to good to be true, they mean it!  When we told them we didn't want most of the add ons they began taking away the original discount also, which I've never seen at any other dealership.  Then we told them we wanted some info before going to financing which never happened.  After telling them the deal was off in the finance office they struggled to return our keys trying to ""save"" the deal.  Once they did finally retrieve them and return them we headed out.  They chased us down as we were preparing to leave saying they ""thought"" they had found the info and to come back.  We left anyways and discussed the whole way home (1 & 1/2 hours) how many things just were wrong and how many times we should've walked away before we did!  So thankful we didn't purchase and have put them on our NEVER CALL AGAIN list of dealerships!",1.0

We are new to Texas and had a mileage checkup due.

27,"July 09, 2018","Great service all the way...
I was in need of service for my 2 month old Ford Fusion 2018 which recently blew up a tire. The dealership (Maxwell Ford) who sold me my car  and its very own service center replaced it and also coincided with my first maintenance check-up. 

The service center agent who handled my car, ""Alberto"" left a bad taste in my experience and left my car unfinished with the service. After I came the day after to report a problem, he dismissively told me that they can't service my car for the day and the next 4 to 5 days! Gave me alot of xxxxxxxx explanation and really unprofessional.

It concided with the upcoming fourth of July week so i was prompted to look elsewhere but unfortunately all the nearby Ford dealership/ Service center are fully booked for the whole week.

I resorted to check the Dealership outside Austin City limit and Ford Griffith save the day for me! They promptly asked me to leave my car to them for the rest of the to have it check and after just a day, everything is fully fix!

Ford Griffith San Marcos is truly one of the best in service. The service manager and the staff are all true professional.

Five star is not enough, two thumbs up all the way!",4.4
28,"July 07, 2018","First time car buyer. Was intimidated by the whole buying process, as I had never done it before. I walked in and was greeted by the receptionist. She got an internet sales manager to help me out. Pricing was true and far better than any other dealership in the surrounding areas. They got me a superb interest rate for being a first time car buyer! Extremely happy. Have referred my Father and Brother since my purchase! ",5.0
29,"June 23, 2018","We went in to trade off a 2016 f150, found a 2018 f150 and my wife also was asking about trading in her 2017 mustang. Our sales person ( Erick ) was helpful at 1st then turned for the worse once paperwork started. We told them we wanted 0 down and our personal bank would finance 90% they tried several times getting us in and out. But 4 weeks later we are still fighting with them on pricing after they changed the buyers order several times. After a few weeks later we found damage to the new car. Following up with them they told us “it was our fault”. Well little to say I’m ashamed we gave them our bussniess. We won’t make that same mistake next time. My bussniess will go back to the “coverts”. So if you wanna get lied to, told different story’s on pricing, and no customer service. DONT SHOP WITH GRIFFTH FORD “any location of there’s. 
Especially the rude losers at Griffth ford San Marcos

30,"June 21, 2018","Awful. Chris, Steve, and Tony are very rude and disrespectful. It disgusts me that I gave them my business. The used car I purchased was filthy when I picked it up. They agreed to issue a refund for the detail - that you pay for in the purchase - but never sent it. Then they flat out lied. They have negative reviews everywhere (Tony is known as a “bully”) just do some research and take your business to a dealership that appreciates its customers. ",1.0
31,"June 02, 2018","I walked into service for a truck issue, after Maxwell (Austin) and Truck City Ford (Buda) said it was the hitch rattling. Wes and Zeb are awesome and straight shooters.  I liked working with them so much, I had them refer me to a sales guy to purchase a car for my daughter. It took a day and we found the perfect car.  Gabriel and Erik are awesome sales guys.  The organization is no hastle, no commissioned sales reps. True consultants. Finance was made easy by a guy names Hopkins. The guy has been in finance for 20 years and owns the relationships with the banks.  They even supplied the bow to surprise her!!! Thank you for everything.

34,"February 17, 2018","They actually deserve no stars. I saw a beautiful 2018 F-150 on the web last week and sent an online request for information. Brandon Rizo with internet sales answered and said they had the truck and to come by for a test drive. I got sick and couldn't go. Today, I sent Brandon a text asking if the truck was still there as it still had my interest. He responded that it was. I told him I was taking off early from work and was heading up from San Antonio. When I arrived, I couldn't find the truck on the lot and knew something was up. I should've known when he was telling me that if I didn't like that truck he had others I could see. I let him know it was only this truck I was after. 
When i got there and couldn't find the truck I went inside where I was greeted by another associate who said Brandon was busy. Erick, internet sales Mgr came up to me, shook my hand and said that the truck was actually sold....not in the hour and a half between the text I received saying it was the and my arrival. 
Needless to say I immediately left. What a bunch of lying idiots. Sad to so for them that I had a friend with me who was also in the market for a new truck so they lost 2 sales. Had they been nice and honest, then maybe we could've talked.
I wasted pto and gas for nothing because of these liars. 
Do you teach all of your salesmen to lie? Is this your standard practice? I've attached the text from Brandon from today telling me the truck was there. What an a_______e.",1.0
35,"November 27, 2017","     I called Wednesday on my way home to make an appointment for Friday at 12pm with Jesse Ponce for 2 specific trucks.  He was very adamant about seeing only him, and not putting in an application online.  Gave him all the details he asked.  He said that he would text us his information.  He never did.  Neither one of us received an email nor a text from him.

     Friday, we drove an hour to be there, arriving half an hour early.  Adam Rizo came out to the parking lot, and I quickly explained we had an appointment with Jesse.  After a quick phone call, he came back and stated that Jesse was out sick.  I asked if he had given anyone the information I had given, and Adam stated no. One of the trucks we came to see was nowhere to be found.  Adam didn't even bother attempting to locate it. We drove the other one, a 2017 F250 4x4 FX4 diesel.  It had a pronounced shimmy in the steering wheel. Adam shrugged it off.  I asked him about towing capacity differences between the FX4 package and a standard XLT. He was not prepared for these questions.  Understandable to a degree, but there are mostly trucks on the lot, and one would assume that a salesman would know a bit more about the trucks. 

     Adam took our keys to have our 2013 F250 4x4 XLT appraised.  Then came and found us to crunch some numbers. They gave us the low end of the value of our truck, while having a decent dealer discount, they have a lot of unnecessary dealer add-on's.  I asked for our keys, and Adam patted his pocket and said, ""I have them.""  Justifiably, my husband was getting a bit perturbed.  Our truck was on the high end of the spectrum of condition, which would have put it $23-27K.  I asked for our keys for the second time.  They weren't willing to negotiate at all on the price.  I asked my husband if he wanted to go look at the truck at Jordan, and Adam proceeded to tell us that his buddy works at Jordan and they also have all the dealer add-on's, including lojack on all of their vehicles. I asked for our keys for the third time.

     Adam went and got his sales manager, and except for pulling off the ""Road Vantage"" for $699.00, he wasn't willing to haggle on the price either.  He kept asking, ""What is it going to take to get you in this vehicle today?""

     We mentioned the shimmy in the steering, and the poor trade-in appraisal.  My husband suggested that they pay tax/tags/title, but the sales manager complained that it was more than all the dealer add-ons.  (it was actually a little over $100 more.)  We were finished.  My husband asked for his keys three times in a row to the sales manager, and we FINALLY got our keys.

     We had to locate our truck, as it was tucked away on the left side of the building (not where they retrieved it from). 

     We purchased a truck that evening from Jordan Ford.  It was a step up from what we were looking at from Griffith, and just about the same price.  And guess what, there are no dealer add-on's at Jordan unless you specifically request it.  Not only were Adam and the sales manager slimy  and greedy in their tactics, they were completely dishonest. But wait, it doesn't stop there.

     The next morning, we are working on the house, and I noticed that I had two missed calls.  One was from Griffith Ford and the other was a cell number.  I had 1 voicemail. It ended up being from Jesse asking us to come back in.  

     I called the cell number, and it ended up being Adam Rizo.  He stated that he just left me a voicemail (a lie, as there was only 1 voicemail, and it was from Jesse).  I told him that we ended up going with a better truck for about the same price at a more honest dealership, and that if he truly had a friend that worked at Jordan, then he would have known that all dealer add-on's on new vehicles were requested by the customer from the Accessories Department.  I told him to have a good day, and hung up.

     I called the dealership and asked for Jesse to return his call.  I explained to him that I understood sudden sicknesses (although it was Black Friday), but I was disappointed that he didn't have the decency to either let us know that he was going to be out, or to give our information to another salesman or even his sales manager to prepare them for our visit. I told him that we were completely disgusted with our treatment, having drove an hour to be lied to and attempted to be taken advantage of.  

    The epitome of what America has come to expect from a car dealer.  Best suggestion? Avoid this, and go to Jordan.  You won't be ripped off there.  There are too many mentors and checks-and-balances to make sure of that.

     And btw, Griffith, Jordan doesn't charge for their dealer prep, either ;)",1.0
36,"October 13, 2017","Absolutely horrendous service, crappy attitude and a horrible little owner named Chris Griffith Jr.  I sent my son (a college student at Texas State) there last Friday to get a headlight fixed. They replaced the Headlight with a defective bulb that did not work. When nightfall came, he realized the light was still out. So he went back the next morning to have it replaced again. They wanted to charge him a diagnostic of about $170 + tax. So I called them and asked to replace the light and if that did not work I would pay for the diagnostic fee. The truck is in excellent condition and has never had a problem. My son finally left, after being rudely addressed to the service department. After my call to the Sales Mgr. we got an agreement and he said he would bring it in next Friday (today) so as not to miss class.  TODAY - the same fool was in service and refused to replace the light and told him he could fit him into the service schedule for 12 days out or he could leave the vehicle and they would try to look at it within the next week. My son called me and of course I make another call. I could not get the same sales manager on the phone (he was off) so I asked for the General Manager / Owner Chris Griffith Jr, they took my number and said he would call in a few minutes. At the same time I texted my son and asked him to go find him and explain the problem. My son found Chris Griffith, who handed him a card and said he never spoke to customers without an appointment and walked away. So Now I'm livid and spend an hour trying to get hold of these complete clowns - The service manager finally returns the call and says they will replace the bulb but if it does not work they will need to diagnose it (same agreement - which was fair, but different then what they kept telling my son - which was he needed to pay the diagnosis fee first - and to schedule an appointment 12 days later to have it diagnosed) . So I sent my Son back over to Griffith Ford - were after 2.5 hours the clowns finally check out the headlight and finally admit they gave me a defective headlight and replaced it. No apologies for being jack as-- and when I spoke with them later acted like they had done me a favor by not charging for labor to replace the faulty bulb they first put in a week earlier. My son had made 5 trips to these fools to handle this problem and dealt with rude fools, I spend more than an hour of my time dealing these incompetent a-ses. Faulty bulbs and parts they don't work will happen and I understand that. HORRENDOUS CUSTOMER SERVICE, RUDE STAFF, INCOMPETENT FOOL, I will not tolerate. SO think twice before you send your son, daughter or family member to this disgusting excuse of a (Griffith) Ford Dealership. Where they think they are doing you a favor fixing their mistakes and the owner who feels he's too important to speak with a customer having a service problem - NEVER WILL I AGAIN SEND MORE SON OR ANYONE ELSE TO GRIFFITH FORD FOR RUDE, HORRENDOUS SERVICE AND A PUNK OF KID FOR AN OWNER - The owner we dealt with was Chris Griffith Jr.  - Its always sad when the 2nd generation of the family fails!",1.0
37,"March 17, 2017","Unknowledgeable sales staff and poor customer service from the very get go of purchasing a vehicle. I already knew the vehicle I wanted and was significantly more knowledgeable ability it than the sales staff Andes able to get a decent deal in it so that part was initially not a big concern. BUT, whatever you do, do not take your vehicle here for service. Your vehicle could be on fire and after a day of doing nothing they will tell you nothing is wrong. Had to bring my brand new vehicle in here that was having obvious transmission issues and despite the ""mechanic"" being able to replicate the issue he told me that the it was not a problem and nothing was wrong. Took the vehicle to another dealership and they knew what was wrong before even inspecting the vehicle based on my description of the issue, then they proceeded to tell me that it is a known issue and ford will be phasing out that particular transmission soon because of the continued issue. Griffith ford has become an absolute joke and has no concern for its customers and it's a shame because I've been doing business here before it became Griffith.",1.0
38,"February 01, 2017","I started on the internet and received a call from Megan at Griffith Ford. She is polite, gracious and very willing to help you get the deal you need to pull the trigger and step into your next new vehicle. We drove there that evening and viewed our dream F150 Fx4. The sales manager went back and did his thing with her a few times and without wasting my time came to a fair price. The business manager Daniel did a great job going over what I wanted and also did a great job. I returned a few days later to get the IOU Rhinoliner sprayed in and I met there service dept. greeters. I was behind a very elderly gentlemen and the young men were extraordinarily patient and polite with him. My turn and they were sharp and helpful. Everything went as promised. Trust me you are in good hands with this dealership. It is a clean well run establishment. Everyone is friendly and professional. Big plus! They have great roads around the dealership to make your test drives a breeze without struggling with traffic. ",5.0
39,"November 19, 2016", Stopped here today to get an oil change and fuel filters replaced on my F2 50    First they said my oil drain plug was stripped and I've only had my truck serviced at Ford dealership before and it has never leaked oil    Then they tried to charge me $216 for the same thing I get done in Houston for $92    I argued and the service manager said he could take $20 off     He ended up taking $58 off but that was still way more expensive than normal   ,1.0
40,"October 31, 2016","I stopped by Griffith Ford in San Marcos with the intent to purchase a new 2016 Ford F150 on Thursday, 27-Oct-2016.  When it came time to discussing price, Griffith Ford was unable to give me the deal I was looking for. They were surprised when I showed them how other Ford dealerships in Austin were discounting $10,000 to $15,000 off MSRP on similar vehicles.  In addition to this, they gave a low ball offer for my trade-in.  I walked out of the dealership, quite disappointed at their performance.  The next day I stopped by Covert Ford in Austin and purchased a new 2016 Ford F150 with a $12,500 discount and fair deal on my trade-in.  Griffith Ford is like the margarine of dealerships or like the diet Coke of dealerships, not the real thing and unable to compete.  My advice:  Do your research and don't accept poor deals from Griffith Ford.",1.2
41,"June 18, 2016","Tanner was an A-1 sales rep-he went the extra mile to get the best deal for me. Mr Griffith and his son took came in to meet us and make sure we were good! Definately buying from them again!!

42,"June 17, 2016","The sales rep, Tanner - went out of his way to help me. He was an outstanding young man and I am impressed with his energy to work with me. However, the finance manager was less than professional and rude. He was so unprofessional after being told I was approved that I walked away from the deal. 
His name is Shaun or Shawn.  I will not be surprised if he remains an employee if he continues with his demeanor. So to my fellow Veterans in San Marcos - we have to depend on one another for advice and how we spend our hard earned money. Steer clear of Griffith Ford San Marcos - Courtesy and respect go a long way with me and the back office lacks both. No manager on site to resolve issue. ",1.0
43,"February 06, 2016","Griffith Ford san marcos,tx Took expedition in for starter ford corporate says new retail is $265/charged  $260 for rebuilt was told by service it was NEW. Had water disappearing on new engine they put in one year ago ,5 days later they say it's hoses and fittings. Labor time for starter 1.2 hrs from corporate but here 1.8 hrs. $55 to check for water leak if I had let them replace  2 heater hoses 1 T fitting charges  would have been  another $471!  Service manager looked up new starter ans said $475 wow. Way above corporate an the old service manager an service rep that put new engine in last year are no longer there i guess because thier honesty an concern for customers . Then the service rep offered to replace hoses for less at his home or mine??????  Behind his bosses back an over a company phone. Please Please don't go there and tell your friends ",1.0
44,"August 01, 2015","The service department is horrible.  They are unethical, dishonest and do not stand behind their work.  In my case they ordered the wrong parts and never could fix my vehicle.  Then they would not release my vehicle until I paid them close to $1000 for the wrong parts they ordered.  End result was I lost a lot of money and my vehicle was not fixed!",1.0
45,"November 06, 2012","If you need work on your Ford do not take it here. It took them 3 days to figure out what was wrong with my vehicle.  I had to get a friend who knows one of the techs to call them.  Two hours after my friend called they figured out what the problem was.  Then they tried to tell me my battery was bad and they could replace it.  The vehicle is  two years old.  I said no, and took it to autozone who could not find any problems with the battery.  I like Ford vehicles but will never come here for anything.  Almost forgot, the service manager Gus had no idea what was going on.  I called to check on the status of my vehicle, and he sounded very pissed off. ",1.0
46,"April 03, 2012",I was charged 1.5 hours for 45 min of work. I have been here twice and they are very slow (hours) to get the diagnosis done. There are better places to get your vehicle serviced in San Marcos. The service guys are friendly.,2.4
47,"April 08, 2011","I purchased a new 2009 Ford Super Duty Crew Cab Diesel 4x4 Pickup, very nice truck.  I decided to trade as we are done RV'ing.  Went to this dealer on April 8, 2011, the very same one I purchased the truck from.  They WILL NOT TAKE IT AS A TRADE!!!!  They want customer loyalty?",1.0
