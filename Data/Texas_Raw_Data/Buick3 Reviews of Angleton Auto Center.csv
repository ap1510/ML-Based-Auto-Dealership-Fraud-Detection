0,"September 10, 2011","We were looking for a truck and looked all across Texas. I found the truck we bought on ebay from this seller but i think they go by Gulf Coast Chevy now but the address is for this dealer off google maps. May be a name change. 

Anyways after working through ebay with Todd Baker We did a surprise drop in since it was close to where we live. After taking a test drive we came back and made a deal that we just could not let go. 

While we waited for finance to go through we decided to leave the dealer to go to Lake Jackson. I think they were worried we would not come back but they did not chase us down or try to keep us there (unlike some dealers i know). They called us while the wife and I were eating lunch and gave us the scoop and we told them done deal we will be back shortly.

Long story short this was the best and least hassle free buying experience we have had yet buying a vehicle. Everyone was was great to work with. If you check them out ask for Todd and tell him the Pennington's sent you.",4.8
