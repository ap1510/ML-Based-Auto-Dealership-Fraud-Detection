0,"April 27, 2020","I got an Escalade from Sewell mainly due to the fact that my dear friend couldn't stop singing praises to Sewell and the way they service their patrons..   Well needless to say I am sold.. They aren't the perfect place... lets be honest no dealership will ever be, however at Sewell you can rest assured that if anything isn't working for you, they will without a doubt walk the extra mile to make it right again... two people will make me for sure purchase again from Sewell 
a. Tim Austin (Sales Rep). 
b. TJ Narlock (Service Manager) THE ABSOLUTE BEST OF ALL!!!   ",5.0
1,"April 17, 2020","I went to purchase a used vehicle and asked to speak to the manager about my trade and I asked him if he was the manager because he didn't have a name tag that said he was the used car manager,I asked if he really is the manager and he got upset and would not sell me the vehicle,I exotic have a great experience but got a poor experience and was very dissapointed,a young used car manager very immature and unprofessional,don't buy a used car from them,go to another dealership who will treat you good and value their customers",1.0
2,"December 24, 2019","Sewell sells lemons! Ever since I purchased my 2017 XT5 from Sewell Cadillac of Houston, I’ve had nothing but issues with the car. We believe it was damaged on their lot during Harvey and never reported. Since, it’s had transmission issues, now random rust specks on the tailgate and just an ongoing array of issues with this car from storm damage. Buyers beware! 

Additionally, I took thisXT5 in for service work as the transmission lights were coming on stating not to drive it anymore. After having it towed across Houston to Sewell, I was told it was and electronic mechanism and they fixed it. I pick it up today, Christmas Eve, and the lights are now coming on. This dealership has nice people but their integrity and ethics are in question by me and many others I’ve spoken to. They should’ve never had this car for sale!",1.0
3,"February 23, 2019","My son who is  under 21 years old and bought his dream car from Kmal but only after three days of due diligence on Kmal and the manager Scott’s part .

These gentlemen don’t sell cars.
You pick one and they help you do whatever you need to gain financing.
My son didn’t know how to do many things but Kmal helped walk him through the process. Kmal is the best person to go meet with when you are ready to buy a car!! Customer after Care is also outstanding!!!",5.0
4,"January 29, 2019","I have redacted my initial review based on a phone conversation with the sale manager.  The review has increased from a 2 to 4 as the issue I was most  upset about was a misunderstanding  in regards to the apparent lack of active  noise cancelling in the XT4.  The sales manager provided documentation that clearly showed the XT4 ANC comes standard and is always on.  My wife still  feels it sounds different than initial car driven, so the sales manager has encouraged  us to  speak  with their  technology specialist.  I did  not give  a 5 star because my thoughts on the last minute lump sum dealer add-ons should have been disclosed earlier IMO.  I do appreciate the sales manager apologizing and he re-iterated they are transparent with their add-ons and place a sticker  in every car highlighting each add on, but not  directly to the window sticker.  I am starting to understand the Sewell customer satisfaction commitment.  In the end it was a miscommunication between the salesperson and  myself.  Curtis  St. Louis is a good salesperson and did his best to match my Wife's most desired options with a car on their lot based on our budget requirements.",4.2
5,"December 01, 2018","Ryan the service director and Sewell have truly been great to work with. Had an issue with my Cadillac CT6 that GM or Cadillac wasn’t will to fix. But Ryan took care of me after a few days. It is nice knowing Sewell stands behind the cars they sell. 
Thank you",4.8
6,"October 21, 2018","They are in decline. Their salesmen are passive aggressive after the fact. They do little digs after the sale. The salesmen don't want to help you with immediate normal questions after the purchase.
12/17 I bought a q7 2017 and ten months later when traded to another Sewell dealership I lost over $10k.
My equity check I was told would take 2 weeks then told 4-5 weeks. I wanted to hear why it would take that long because I know dealers are directly linked to the state. After 20 minutes of explaining and insults pretty much telling me not to ask because it's only been a week, I told the lady, because I'm smart lol, ""ok, then technically the car and the title are both mine and now I can call the state to inquire about the timing."" Then immediately I was told that in fact it has already been verified that my title was clear which was the only reason for the delay she said. Then she told me, "" it should be any day.""
That equals lies. Then the salesman called me passive aggressively saying I was causing trouble jokingly and asked had I been drinking because he could tell. Wow! They're exceptional until the deal is done but not standing by their own quality for trade ins.",3.0
7,"January 11, 2018","I bought a certified 2015 Cadillac XTS in Jan, 2017, with 6 years, 70000 miles bumper to bumper warranty. 

After several of driving, I found that the defroster of rear win-shield does not work at all. so I went to Sewell Cadillac Dallas first for a check, but they told me they could not where the problem is. Good thing is I'm in Dallas, TX and there are not so many times that I would need to use this defroster, so I just left with it without trying another Sewell dealership in Grapevine, which turns out to be the biggest mistake I made. 

Recently as the weather in Dallas is getting cold, and it takes me more than 15-20 minutes to wait for the rear win-shield get clear, because the xxxx defroster doesn't work at all. I had to go to Sewell Cadillac Grapevine for another check. I was told by the technician that something was disconnected/broken inside the circuit, which most likely happened when the glassed was tinted. They will need to take off the whole glass and get it fixed. Unfortunately, this is not covered by the warranty. they need me to talk with whoever sold me this car for a solution. So I called Sewell Cadillac. My salesperson was out, and his manager( Scott) answered the phone. 

The conversation with this guy was really frustrating. He didn't want to assume any responsibility for the problem they made--they sold me a car with a problem with the defroster and they just hide that to me. He refused to cover any cost to get this issue fixed, and asked me ""how could we know that the problem was not caused by you? you have bought this car for one year and anything could happen during this time..."" Come on, you think that I am such a bored person that I have to find some time to get my car out of work? I swear to God that I never even touched the rear win-shield since I bought this car!

This is really horrible experience. The sales with this dealership are liars and irresponsible. I love Cadillac, but shame on you--Sewell Cadillac of Houston!",1.0
8,"December 13, 2017","Sewell Cadillac is the most amazing Cadillac dealership! I just truly cannot say enough wonderful things about them. I have owned a Cadillac for the last 11 years. I don’t think I would get any other car for so many reasons. The customer service is just outstanding. Everyone is so helpful and attentive. Matt Mowrey always goes above and beyond and he should be recognized. The service department shines. Every single employee is so dedicated to their job and they run like a well oiled machine. There is never any waiting around or wondering what is going on. You are always taken care of like a queen or king. The communication is superb. 
The waiting area is always so tidy and nice. There is tv, drinks, snacks, whatever you want. They make you feel so comfortable. 
The dealership is always sparkling clean, even the shop... it’s insane! 
People are always holding doors open for you, greeting you, making sure you are taken care of, getting stuff out of your car and transferring to the complimentary loaner they provide, which is always so nice. 
Thank you Sewell for taking care of me and my family and of course my beautiful Cadillac Escalade.  We love y’all and appreciate you ??",5.0
9,"November 07, 2017","I beg you to seriously, seriously consider NOT doing business with Sewell Cadillac of Houston. If you do not heed this warning, you may end up with a horror story like mine. I have an older model xxx Cadillac; 130,000 miles. It has served me well…still has a strong engine and a very well kept, attractive body. Lately, it was intermittently over-cranking when I started the engine. To ensure that the problem would be identified properly, I took it to Sewell Cadillac of Houston for a major diagnosis. Considering the age of my car, I learned that there were several problems. I was told that correcting these issues would cost me $15,000. The service tech advised me to “buy another car” and asked to connect me with a sales associate. 

Most of the repairs were minor…nothing that would prohibit the car from functioning.  I chose to address a power steering fluid leak by replacing the power steering hose. I also chose to correct the over-cranking for which Sewell replaced several sensors, a seal, a plenum boot, a harness and another hose. My car was in Sewell’s service department from August 17 – September 5, 2017. Three weeks later, I was told that the repairs were done and my car was “fixed.”  I paid a repair invoice of $1500.85. The sun was shining, the birds were singing and all was right with the world...until it wasn’t. 

After driving the car for several days, I realized that my car was still over-cranking. I returned my car to Sewell’s service department on September 30. Four days later, I was told (via phone) that my car needed an additional $4200 repair to correct the over-cranking problem. Now, I was being told that the over-cranking issue would be corrected if I replaced the right and left catalytic converters. Imagine my surprise!  Hadn’t I already paid to correct the over-cranking problem? Once again, I was given the option of buying another car…hmmm. 

I feel violated, used, abused and bamboozled. Given the millions that Sewell reaps monthly, I’m certain that my $1500 was considered a drop in the bucket. However, its hard earned money that my husband and I paid (to no avail) to correct a problem that was not corrected. All we got out of the deal was a very expensive hose replacement.          

Here’s the good news… I did not purchase another car.  I did secure an EXCELLENT mechanic shop that repaired my over-cranking issue, costing $501.      

To the three associates that I spoke with…General Manager Dennis Noble, Service Director Ryan Nemic and Assistant Service Manager Mike Gust, I would like to say… Customer service is NOT taking someone’s money and artfully dismissing them with insincere politeness. Customer service is making sure that a customer leaves your place of business with an exceptional, quality sales/service experience. Earn you money, don’t steal it!

Needless to say, I WILL NEVER spend another nickel at Sewell Cadillac of Houston. Needless to say, I will warn family, friends, associates and even strangers against doing business with this company. They are unscrupulous thieves!

10,"May 10, 2017","Took my '05 STS into Sewell Cadillac Houston for 60K and 70K service. Matt Mowry was my Service coordinator. He was accurate in his diagnosis of my car's problems, he accurately quoted prices for the repairs, and he kept me informed during the two days the service department had the car. The technicians did a great job on the repairs and my car purrs like a kitten. In my experience very few people have taken the time to fully explain and keep me up-to-date like Matt did. Matt, Kristen and the cashier were all upbeat and positive. Their positive attitudes were greatly appreciated and represented Sewell Cadillac Houston very well. Thank you for the excellent service",4.8
11,"April 19, 2017","I moved to the Houston area from Detroit Michigan with my well maintained 2009 DTS with well documented maintenance records from lafantaine cadillac in Brighton Michigan.

Again I purchased this Cadillac brand new. 

While driving from Detroit to my new home in the Houston area  a message appeared across the dashboard which read "" SERVICE LANE DEPARTURE"" so on May 3, 2014 while driving through Houston I noticed the Sewell Cadillac sign so I immediately exited the Katy freeway and pull into the service department.

After having the issue of the lane departure diagnosed by the Sewell technicn I was told that the module went out and needed replacement the cost to me was $696.71

Even though that was steep but for a beautiful Cadillac that was ""BABIED"" since new well it was money well spent and I wouldn't have to worry about that for some time to come, but to my dismay almost 8 months later (January 2015) I experienced the same message telling me to service my lane departure system. Right then I called Sewell Cadillac where they fixed the problem on May 3, 2014 and explained that there's problem with lane departure system and that they serviced the 8 months earlier and could they repair or replace the module. Well later that day I brought the car in and explained the issue to the technicn and to my dismay told me that it would cost me another 696 or so dollars to fix the problem again. I advised him politely and he refused to replace the module even though the repair was still under warranty. 

That was the ABSOLUTE WORST EXPERIENCE EVER at a Cadillac dealership. With that I say to all STAY AWAY FROM SEWELL CADILLAC!!
IF I COULD GIVE THEM ZERO STARS I WOULD!

13,"February 25, 2013","Even though I work in downtown Houston, and there's a more ""convenient"" dealer within walking distance of my office, I researched dealers based on reputation, and the Sewell name is associated with top-notch experiences.  I know that Sewell has operation in Dallas, and I'm very pleased to see them in Houston now.  Sewell Cadillac is beautiful and immaculate facility, and all of the employees whom I dealt with contributed to a very good experience.  ",5.0
