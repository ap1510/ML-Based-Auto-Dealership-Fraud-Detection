5,"July 31, 2019","I had the best experience in leasing a vehicle with Fernandez Honda. I went online and submitted my request through Honda's website and typed one of San Antonio's zip codes. Within minutes Kevin Elias called me about my new car request. I told him exactly what I was looking for and he immediately started working with me. I was doing all my negotiations with him via cell phone. I reside in Corpus Christi and was looking for the best deal. Kevin Elias informed me about a leasing promotion Honda was offering and I was listening because this was in my price range. During the negotiations, I spoke with him very briefly because I was at work and just needed the best deal out there. I had done my homework and knew what vehicle and monthly payments I was was willing to accept. I was amazed by Kevin Elias prompt response. When I showed up to pick the vehicle, all I had to do was sign the paperwork. Everything was ready. I never wasted any time with negotiations and so forth. They were very straight forward. My experience was a breeze. The drive to San Antonio was worth my time and money. The kind of deal Fernandez Honda made me was exceptional. I could not have made the same agreement with the dealer in my own town. 
 Thank you Fernandez Honda for working with me so efficiently.

6,"July 12, 2019","Recently had a dead battery on my 2013 Honda Accord. The battery went dead in my garage and I did not have a set of jumper cables, the battery was under warranty. I called Joe Yracheta (service consultant) at Fernandez Honda and explained my situation. He said no problem, bring in the battery and he would take care of me. I did and he took great care of my situation. I left about 30 minutes later with a new battery. Great service!

10,"February 02, 2019","I purchased a pre-owned vehicle from Fernandez Honda on 31 Jan 10.  The sales consultant (Remi Vitales) was both friendly and professional.  He was good to work with and met my needs/desires completely.  The business manager (Oscar Fernando) was also professional, friendly and a real pleasure to work with.  He also met my needs/desires and was eager to go out of his way to provide assistance.  These two individuals should be commended for their work.  I'm fully satisfied with the vehicle I purchased.

Our sales person was Ruben Fuentez,  He is a very friendly professional who made sure that we, his customers, were comfortable and informed as to the progress of the deal.

51,"March 19, 2018","Slowest car purchase ever! Purchased a Honda CR-V from Fernandez Honda. Came in at 1:30. Decided to buy the car by 2:30, and it took 4 more hours to close a cash sale. They had 20+ sales staff but not enough people to close deals.  Gil ""G"" Martinez closed the deal efficiently once in his office and was very helpful. Tammy in sales got us through the test drive just fine. The part that fell apart was the lengthy time in between. We traded in an old car and they were slow to evaluate it. 

After waiting for 3 hours, I called the sales manager's cell phone (we met him at the beginning of the process, he gave us his card) and got a voicemail. I left a polite, but direct message that we were frustrated with the process. Received no call back. Waited another hour.

We were late to pick up our son and cancelled plans for a Friday night trip to visit family due to these delays.

The signs showed Mr. Shaw as Dealer of the Year. Not sure how this happened. I will never shop at Fernandez Honda again.",2.4

The first time I came to Fernandez Honda was in 2013 to trade-in the 1996 Honda Accord for a 2013 Honda CR-V.  A year later I traded the 2013 Honda CR-V for a 2014 Honda Accord EX-L.  Super vehicle with a super drive.  I loved it.  Every time I come in for a preventative maintenance I always see another vehicle I would love to have.  This time I traded in my 2014 Honda Accord for 2017 Honda CRV Touring.  Amazing vehicle!!!  I love it.  Freddy always makes the numbers work and I truly trust his judgement.  Fernandez Honda is the only dealership I trust and will remain a lifetime customer.  Thank you Freddy, Mejia, Lupe Lara, and Oscar Fernandez for a truly EXCELLENT experience.

167,"February 21, 2017","I went through an employer sponsored car buying program to locate a new vehicle.  Once I entered my information, Ernest Esteves of Fernandez Honda immediately reached out to me with a detailed price quote for a vehicle that fit my specifications.  The price was super competitive and there were no hidden fees.   I set up an appointment, and was able to test drive and then purchase the vehicle that same day.  The only somewhat negative aspect was that the process took 5 hours.  This was due to the time it took to get my trade-in appraised, plus a rather long wait for my turn in the business office. 

Everyone at the dealership was very professional, friendly and helpful.  Ernest did a great job going over all of the features of the vehicle and even followed up the next day to see if I had any questions.  Gilbert Martinez in the business office assisted me with all of the paperwork and made sure that I understood the warranty features.  I also appreciate the assistance given by Daniel (I didn't get his last name) in assessing g my trade-in.  I called a few times and was always greeted pleasantly by Evelyn Gomez.

196,"December 30, 2016","I had sold my car and went to Fernandez Honda to purchase a 2017 Honda Accord E-XL V6 White
Orchid Pearl. ( Car not in stock ) I have purchased many cars in my lifetime. That is a lot of sales-
men to deal with. I will say Mr. Joe Campos was the Best. If i had only one word to describe Joe's
Attitude - He treated me with ""Honor"" I could use a lot of Superlatives but thats the best.

For starters, Fernández Honda had lowest base price;  $685 under MSRP...lower than any other Honda dealer in San Antonio. They added an additional discount of over $2K per vehicle. THIS IS THE PLACE TO BUY YOUR HONDA!!!!  
We were looking at purchasing not 1 but 3 2017 Honda Civic Hatchbacks.  One EX, one EX-L w/ Nav, and a one Sport. GUNN’s “One Simple Price” was an average of only $237 under MSRP for each car.  Fiesta Honda kept wasting our time with games so we gave up dealing with them. Gillman’s prices with USAA were right at MSRP and they would not negotiate below that price.

238,"September 22, 2016","We were in San Antonio for the weekend to visit Sea World with my wife and daughter when we got into town late Thursday night I had a warning light begin to start flashing on my Accord. I was worried about what possible damage might occur if I continued to drive as well as being stranded in the middle of nowhere on our return trip to Houston. So I tried to schedule an appointment on line for service.

They were fully booked up for the next day but I decided to be there when they opened just in case I could get in. I met Joshua Verdin the service adviser and told him my situation he said he would make sure that a service technician would lock at my car.

Later I met and spoke with the service technician Daniel and he informed me what had been found but that he did not have the part available after explaining to him that I was from out of town and would have to remain in town until they got the part he told me he would see what he could do.

He returned after awhile and said he found the part and stayed over installing the part as well as running diagnostic recheck and driving test. to make sure my car was in good shape for our return trip.

Joshua and Daniel both went the extra mile to make sure our weekend as well as our return trip was fun and safe!

If I lived in San Antonio I know where I would be buying my next Honda.

Thank you Fernandez Honda.",5.0

240,"September 19, 2016","I took my car in for the window tint I purchased from them and after waiting an hour longer than what they told me it would take I got my car back only to have the trunk covered in white (my car was a dark blue/grey). I asked them if they could run it through the car wash they have since it was really dirty after the tint and they did. After waiting 20 minutes (no exaggeration) for the guy to come back with my car he tells  me he ran it through the wash twice and couldn't get the ""dirt"" off my car. I inspected my car and realized it was not dirt and instead some white residue that was embedding itself into the paint job of my car (which was only a week old). I tell the guy that I want them to wash it off since it was getting into the paint. The guy basically tells me it wasn't their fault and that there is nothing they can do. I tell him I wasn't leaving until they resolved the issue since it WAS their fault. After they inspect it for another 15 minutes they come back just to tell me what I already know and then start telling me it was just dirt or tree sap and that I parked it somewhere and didnt wash the car in time so it embedded itself into the paint. I tell them I don't park anywhere near trees on my daily route and they give me some spiel that they do the tint from the inside so it couldn't be from them. I realize that they do use a soap/adhesive for the back window when they apply it and know that its probably the adhesive from that that is on my trunk. I go through 3 people and everyone of them tells me I must have brought it in dirty or parked it close to a tree/dirty area. Finally the last guy talks to me and patronizes me the entire time and says that I must have parked it near people who where painting a car (some bs excuse) and that it looked like over spray. I told him that was not the case and he tells me that I ""must see the situation from their perspective"". 
I told him to see from mine, I bought that car a week ago and they already damaged it and wont at the very least take responsibility for it. 
He then tells me just to go buy a clay bar and basically take it off myself.

To put how bad the damage was it looked like 15+ years worth of sun damage done to the paint of the car in and hour and a half.

Also, during my car buying phase I was unfortunately matched with a salesman who was a complete jerk. He made rude, asinine remarks about the car I brought in to trade and even made an insulting remark about my fiance when we told him about an accident she was in. He was unprofessional and honestly I wish I had another salesperson. He wasted an hour of my time when I was trying to figure out what the rate of my loan would be and who the lender was (I was trying to see if I could get a lower rate than my bank USAA). After I find out the rate was going to be almost a point higher I decided I didn't was to go with the bank they offered me, a decision that would have cut an hour of my time to make. Over all my experience was frustrating and they kept pressuring me and saying things like, oh its only a small difference (money wise). The finance guy didn't even take off the adjusted amount and sold me the car for more than what they originally agreed for me to pay, a $90 difference.

It was sad because I really wanted my next car to be from this dealer since my previous car was purchased from here and my parents both bought 2 cars years ago from the dealer. Their service now is poor and  everyone is nice until you purchase a car from them, then they don't care so long as they car has been paid off buy the bank. Terrible place to shop for a car and I would recommend Fiesta, Gunn, or any other dealer if you are interested in a Honda.",1.8

332,"December 01, 2015","I had been getting my ""lifetime"" car detailing (detail) @ Fernandez Honda (promised to me from Anthony Deleon when I purchased my Accord back in 2004) for 12 years until they abruptly stopped after I took my Accord in for my detail last month.  

Although I had been getting my ""lifetime"" detail there for the past 12 years Adam Claiborne claims (as he belittled, humiliated, and disregarded everything I was saying like I was making everything up) that the detail promotion they were offering at that time was only for 5 years. I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I KNOW WHAT WAS PROMISED TO ME!! --THAT""S WHY I BOUGHT MY CAR FROM THERE VS SOMEWHERE CLOSER TO ME (Sea World area).

So, I then asked Adam if it was only for 5 years how did I get away with getting details for the past 7 years. He didn't have a good answer for me of course, but made it a point to let me know that I would no longer be getting free details there. By the way, there's a record in their system of all the years that I've gone, and my wife even took my car when I was in the Military, and deployed to Afghanistan in 2010.

I asked Adam why wouldn't they just honor something that they had been doing for the past 12 years to keep a loyal customer happy (i bought my Odyssey from there too).  After all, it's not like if I'm gonna be keeping my 04 Accord for too much longer.  As a matter of fact, I was looking to upgrade soon, but thanks to the disloyalty, mistrust, and misguidance from Fernandez Honda (particularly Adam Claiborne)--I will no longer be a customer there. 

Lastly, he told me that he would give me discount on future car details ... at that point, I just walked away.  It's like why would you offer any type of discount if you felt %100 content/comfortable with the decision of taking away my ""lifetime"" details. In other words, he obviously knew he was doing something wrong.

By the way, I went by Gunn Honda this past weekend to buy a part for my Accord, and their service was excellent, and will be going back there for future purchases. ",1.0

We were able to negotiate the deal over the phone. I took pictures of my trade in car and texted them to Henry, he gave me a great price quote for the trade in and it was honored without any problems when we got to the dealership. Henry had texted me a couple times during the week so he could have the paperwork ready for us when we arrived and the car and paperwork were ready. I was a little disappointed that the 1 hour time quote for us to be in and out actually took a bit over two hours but other than that the transaction was very smooth. Henry sat in the car with me and showed me the features and I found this to be quite helpful as I am a hands on learner. Henry also had the car detailed and in beautiful shape for us. Thank you Henry, it was a pleasure doing business with you!",5.0

393,"January 19, 2015","I was in the market for a vehicle for my mother.  I initially was looking at a small sedan.  Prior to my visit I looked at the online inventory on the company's website, and after doing some comparison I had a vehicle in mind.  I spoke to my salesperson Ruben Fuentes over the phone initially, and provided him with the vehicle's information I was interested in.  When I arrived at the store Mr. Fuentes had parked the vehicle around the side of the store, and it was ready for me to take on a test drive.  Before ""pulling the trigger"" I still wanted to compare the small sedan to the small SUV I ultimately decided on.  Mr. Fuentes was patient enough to show me the vehicles side-by-side, explained the features of each vehicle, and pointed out the pros and cons of one versus the other to meet my mother's needs.  I had made my mind up and was ready to proceed.  While I was filling out the paperwork Ruben's manager, Aaron Sanchez came by and asked if I had any questions regarding the paperwork provided.  He was very knowledgeable and was able to thoroughly explain some answers to questions that I had regarding the car facts I was provided with in my packet.  When I went on to do the finance portion I was greeted by Don Keoviva.  Mr. Keoviva made me feel that he was working on getting me the best possible rate out there.

I found them through Pen Fed's car buying service which uses TrueCar. Fred Mejia was the sales representative who worked with me and was outstanding. He contacted me very quickly and e-mailed me the price they were offering which was well below the TrueCar estimate. Fred was very knowledgeable and did an excellent job of showing me the van's features. There was no haggling about the price or back and forth between the sales office because the price he quoted was the actual price!  No games here, just straight forward good business. I truly wish all dealerships would operate this way. They also gave me an outstanding price on my trade in. The finance manager, Jeff Bouchard, was excellent as well. He made the process very easy.

All came back with several thousand more than what I was looking for. Im sure this was in hopes to haggle down but even after a few back and forth emails most only went down a few hundred to a thousand. The guys at Fernandez Honda very first response was two thousand less than what I had been looking to pay. These guys are up front with their pricing and do a great job of ensuring that your getting what you want. They even gave me $500 more for my trade than I had been offered elsewhere. Henry was awesome, he thoroughly explained everything about the vehicle to my wife and helped her set some of the things up, like syncing her phone to it all while I did the paperwork. They met and exceeded all of my expectations...except one. He told me it would take about 45 minutes to get the paperwork done and it took closer to 2 hours :(

413,"November 20, 2014","Let me start out by saying that typically I strongly dislike dealing with car salesmen.  That being said, dealing with Jesse Soto and his sales manager Gilbert Martinez was a pleasure.  Since I live in Houston, Jesse was willing to go out of his way to make sure all of my needs were attended to, all my questions were answered, and even came in on his day off to complete the sale because I was driving in from out of town.  Jesse told me he does not work on commission, and I believe it because I ended up with a smoking deal on a 1 year old Accord.  After paying for the car with the finance guy, I snuck around back to see my car being detailed and caught Jesse back there helping the detail team by vacuuming out my car then wiping it down with a rag.  Again, this was all done on his day off and in his good clothes (minus the dress jacket).  He was very courteous and professional throughout the entire process and even helped me sync my phone to the car's bluetooth before I left the dealership.

Tariq went above and beyond working with Adam Claiborne to beat the competition. All in all Tariq is amazing and what he does and defiantly deserves full credit for it.

421,"September 24, 2014","I took my Pilot in for a scheduled B1 service maintenance at the service department around 8:30am and opted to wait for it, since it is only a minor maintenance. It turns out that I waited until 4:00pm. I was patiently waiting for it but I am boiling inside. I keep checking the status of it with the service advisor J and get assurances from him that it will be done shortly, but still waited and waited and not being informed of the exact details of what is going on. Service advisor J apparently gave my service paperwork to service advisor-in-training M and I was told he already left for the day. I am very upset for the lack of professionalism and incompetence of service advisor-in-training M's work and service. I am very disappointed of how disorganized and irresponsible is the service team, if I did not make a follow-up of my car, most probably my car was forgotten. Service advisor J apologized and gave me some consolation of not charging me for the maintenance service and gave me my paperwork and sends me off. Upon looking at the paperwork, I am not sure if all of the B1 service has been done since I only see an oil change, multi point inspection, car wash and the warranty repair. I also did not see the multipoint inspection report that I used to get on my first maintenance service. Limited attention to details, lack of oversight and leadership in the service department and it looks like work was being done hastily. 
I am very disappointed of the service I received from Fernandez Honda on this visit. I already bought two cars from this dealership and I am bringing my cars to other Honda dealership for its maintenance. I have sent an email to their GM and Service Manager but haven't heard from any one of them as of this writing.

UPDATE: I received a call from the General Manager - Adam C.  after a few days, he apologize and assured me that it will never happen again. Adam set me up for another appointment to re-check and complete the B1 service. I took my Pilot back and the visit took less than an hour, the service advisor Kevin W. was excellent. ",3.0

442,"June 25, 2014","I knew going in which car i was going to purchase, I had already done my homework; my wife and i purchased a 2014 Accord.  The problem i have with this dealer is that they just wanted to close on the sale to go home and the service department did a poor job of delivering the vehicle.  When we received the car, the car was not completely wiped down around the doors and the door jams, truck and inside the hood; all was dusty and dirty.  So I cleaned the car at home the following day.  Moving on.  We ordered tint for the windows, body side moulding and pinstriping on the car and since it was late, Jordan stated that he would coordinate the services and call me on Monday with the details, we agreed.  

Four days later (Thursday) I had to call Jordan to obtain a status for the services, since he hadn't called me back.  Later that the day, Joey from the service department called me and  I took the car in the following Friday and picked it up that afternoon.  I was very disappointed when i picked up the car.  Although the items i mentioned above had been installed, there was dust, hand prints and evidence that some type of fluid was used to apply the pinstripe.  There was dried dripping water or some fluid all around the car.  But since it was late in the evening i just took the car home and cleaned it myself. 

Prior to buying the Accord at Fernandez Honda, my wife and I had purchased two (2) Cadillac's from Ken Batchelor, and everytime we took the car for service, the car had been washed and vacummed; i guess you do get what you pay for.  In all fairness, I believe we got a fair price on the car, but the service department needs to pick it up a notch.  Service really makes a diference and it defines what type of dealership your are.

The staff there were also very knowledgeable and friendly. My advice, if you are looking for a new honda, look no further, head straight to Fernandez Honda.",5.0

When I was ready I emailed 12 dealerships in the Central Texas area requesting a quote for my CR-V. Justin Salazar from Fernandez Honda was the first to respond. Out of the 9 dealers who responded with a quote Justin's was the best. So, after 20+ emails with various questions and receiving a prompt and honest answer to each, we settled on a price, Justine located a vehicle that I wanted, not once trying to sell me something that I didn't want and had on his lot. I really appreciated that. He had the vehicle transferred to his dealership and we made an appointment to come in to finalize the deal.

Dont waste your time, they are honest, not pressure you to buy immediately and with unprecedented prices.

515,"August 20, 2013","Good morning,

I am a customer of your Fernandez Honda Car Dealership in San Antonio. My family, some close friends and I have all purchased a vehicle through your company less than a year ago. I am writing you to inform you of the wonderful service I recently received from your employee, Rick Gallegos, who works in the service area.

I go to Fernandez Honda for all service needed for my new Honda Accord (2012). I always get expedient, courteous service from everyone at your store. However, just recently, when I needed a new hub-cap, I visited your store and was greeted by one of your service center employees. He was courteous, but not very well informed about my questions as to why my present hub-cap was in the condition it was in (which is why I needed it replaced). This employee called over Mr. Rick Gallegos. Mr. Gallegos' energy, attitude and knowledge made me confident that I came to the right place for service! He took the time to explain why my hub-cap was was warped as it was, and took the time to answer all of my questions. I was so impressed with his professionalism, knowledge of his trade, and patience. He never once seemed hurried, or annoyed that I had so many questions. He, in fact, made me feel as if I was the ONLY customer that needed attention. I have never received service of this caliber at your store, or any other service center (I used to own a Toyota). 

Therefore, I thought because Mr. Gallegos took the time to help me because he saw me as an important customer, I will in turn take the time to compliment him because he is an important asset to your store. I have already told many people (who own Hondas) of Mr. Gallegos' service, and they have made a mental note. 

I appreciate the professionalism and personable service I always receive from your employees. However, Mr. Gallegos' professionalism went above and beyond any service I have ever experienced anywhere! Thank you for your time.",5.0

528,"July 23, 2013","Tariq was the ultimate of a professional. Often as a female buying a vehicle, I am treated a bit less than equal. This was not my experience with Tariq. He asked questions about my goals in buying a car and he actually listened to my answers. Because of that, we found the perfect car for me within 30 minutes of our initial meeting.

He negociated the price for me with others in the office and provided me with a satisfactory price I could afford to pay. Upon my purchase, Tariq sat in the vehicle with me and guided me through the use of the buttons and gadgets I had no familiarity with. I left feeling extremely confident in my ability to find my way around the functions in this automobile.

At all times there was courtesy and an atmosphere of warmth. It is the first time in my life buying a car has not been a traumatic experience. I would recommend Fernadez Honda to anyone and I would refer them to Tariq with total confidence they would benefit from the experience as I did. Positive, positive, positve. Thank you Fernandez.",4.8
529,"July 22, 2013","I went to get my windows re-tinted on a 2013 Honda.  I met Lin( service manager) in the showroom and he walked me to my car to meet with Loue( the tint person) and I asked them how long it would take to get the two back seat windows re-tinted and Loue said ""about an hour.""  I was there for 4 hours and finally my car came out.  

I did not appreciate that I was there for so long and the windows look the same.  It took 4 hours to do two windows?  This is unacceptable as I am referred as a VIP since I have bought 4 cars from Fernandez.  I did not feel VIP at all---4 hours to do two windows? 

Someone should have informed me know that it was going to take longer than one hour.  I could accept that.  But no one said anything and I sat there watching cooking shows for four hours.  As a VIP, I need some kind of compensation.  I spent half my Friday to get two windows tinted---come on---this is ridiculous.

I hope it never happens again.  I drive over 35 miles to buy from Fernandez but now I might reconsider and go somewhere else where I can     be a real VIP and closer to my home.  What would you do?????  Let me know.

530,"July 22, 2013","I have been taking my 2005 Honda Accord, which I've kept, to Fernandez Honda for eight years, and I always told Aaron Sanchez, who worked in the Service Department at the time that because of his professional and friendly demeanor, I would buy my next Honda here.  One day while having my car serviced, one of my former students, Tariq Kassam, recognized me.  He informed me that he was a salesman here and gave me a coupon for my car's next oil change and his business card.  When I discovered he had been salesman of the year, I decided that I was closer to purchasing a vehicle, and it would be through him.  I finally surrendered to having a new monthly  payment for my 2013 CR-V.  Tariq, Fabian, Aaron, and Mark Anthony were all very professional, knowledgeable, friendly, patient with my myriad of questions, courteous, and encouraging.  Tariq especially is an exceptional young man (as he was in high school).  He placed no pressure on me and was helpful when I explained that my credit score may be lower than it ever has been in years.  He indeed made me feel like a VIP!  He patiently explained the features (blue tooth, Pandora, DVD player, cell phone sync/speed dial) to the SUV I was looking for and had me purchasing my lovely pearl white CR-V within hours, AND the dealership gave me a fantastic finance rate.  The whole purchasing process was without pressure and pleasant.  Tariq is an invaluable asset to Fernandez Honda and should be manager some day soon.??  Fernandez Honda Dealership is always a clean environment, and all staff is courteous and helpful.  Their hospitality is immeasurable and the waiting time for servicing is enhanced with coffee, freshly-baked cookies, cold bottled water , and/or popcorn.

534,"June 26, 2013","Tariq Kassam and his friendly staff provided a pleasant and expeditious process in buying our new Honda FIT.  From beginning to end they worked with us to get the price down, even absent a trade in vehicle.  In the end the price and downpayment we all arrived at was good enough that we abandoned our idea to lease the car and decided to go ahead and buy it instead.  We have three Hondas and two were purchased at Gunn, which was an okay experience, but that dealership is so far out of town that anyone living anywhere near Alamo Heights or south should definitely consider Fernandez Honda - particularly anyone working in downtown.

We were four hours from home when our car broke down in San Antonio and we needed to replace it right away. Coach was patient and didn't push us into anything, but let us determine what we were interested in and comfortable with. After we initially talked with him, we went down the road to another dealership where they were VERY pushy! We left quickly and returned to work with Coach. Once we selected the Accord, he drove us to the mechanic's so that we could get our things from our car and then stayed late to make sure that the purchase went through smoothly. He even promised to ship us our Thule roof rack, and when it was stolen from the car in the mechanic's parking lot, he drove there to talk to the manager and find out what happened.

In comparison to all the other Hondas I had researched, including ones in Austin, this was the best deal overall. Our finance manager, Mark Anthony, was also very friendly and made my experience even better. He made me feel that he was just as excited as I was in buying my first car. He answered and helped me understand every question I had for him.

After frequent trips to San Antonio we had been shopping for a car that would suit our frequent travel needs.  We had visited several dealerships in West Texas but I was immediately discouraged from buying any vehicle from two of the Honda dealerships due to unprofessional salesmen.  I was actually dreading the car shopping experience due to the past ones but was pleasantly surprised when Tariq Kassam approached us and offered assistance.  Mr. Kassam was helpful, courteous and demonstrated exceptional knowledge of the Honda Civic.  Mr. Kassam's pleasant demeanor made us comfortable asking numerous questions regarding the vehicle.  We never felt pressured to make a commitment on the purchase of a vehicle.  Ultimately, we decided to purchase the vehicle and the transaction went very smooth.  After a 5 hour drive back home my husband and I were pleasantly surprised to receive a follow up call from Mr. Kassam to ensure we had arrived safely and that we did not have any follow up questions on the vehicle.

Freddy greeted me and my daughter's Godmother in an eager and positive professional manner with a smile from ear to ear.  I had gone to Gillman Honda on Thursday, January 17 and met Marc Wright.  We met him around 8:15 pm and he showed us the Honda Insight and the Honda CRV.  I test drove both.  Mr. Wright kept referring me to a Honda Civic and I told him I wasn't interested in purchasing a Civic.  I told him I was already pre-approved by USAA with a 3.18% interest rate.  He said we can get you a better rate with Security Service.  Mr. Wright asked what color was I interested in and I said White Diamond Pearl.  He checked his inventory and he said they did not have one but that he would contact other dealerships to find the one I want.  On Friday, January 18, Mr. Wright called to say he called several dealerships and no one had the color I was interested in and he said he hated to turn away business but in my case he could not be of assistance to me but he said he would keep me posted if he did find the vehicle I wanted. Mr. Wright ask if I hadn't found a vehicle yet, would I mind him calling me back in the future and I told him not at all.  I told Mr. Wright if you have it fine and if you don't that was fine too then it wasn't meant to be.  Obviously, Mr. Wright did not want my business bad enough.  On Saturday, January 19, I went with the girls to a movie and lunch and afterwards me and my daughter's Godmother went to Fernandez Honda.  WOW!!! What a FANTASTIC experience.  I really felt that Freddy Mejia was there to be of service to me in finding the vehicle I wanted.  When we walked around the lot there were several White Diamond Pearl vehicles, but then I saw the metallic silver vehicle and that was it.  I test drove it and I was sold.  Freddy gave me a better deal on my interest rate and on the purchase price of the vehicle and he also gave me more for my 1996 Honda Accord trade-in.  The experience overall was very professional, no game playing, and it was all handled in a timely manner.  I was out in 4 hours or less.  I would have been gone from the dealership sooner in my new CRV, but Freddy took the time to show me how to use the bluetooth and the other vehicle options in my new CRV.  I'm so satisfied and very proud of Freddy's professional, kind, and courteous service.  He's truly an asset at Fernandez Honda.  With such great service, I will always be a Fernandez Honda Girl (Not A Gillman Girl) and will be more than happy to refer all my family and friends to Fernandez Honda.

584,"July 19, 2012","To whom it may concern,
We wanted to take the time to recognize and recommend Fernandez Honda and its employees.  We have purchased six vehicles from Fernandez Honda, and we've always recommended friends and family members as well. In turn, they have purchased several vehicles as well. This was our first dealing with Yasu. I have to say that he was great in assisting us with the sales process. Personally am disabled, and recently had spinal surgery and could not be at the dealership for any great length of time. Yasu was considerate of our situation and attempted to expedite the process as quickly and efficiently as possible. We actually did not come in the dealership with the intent to purchase a new vehicle but with the circumstances and the workings of your staff we ended up trading in a vehicle that we origionally purchased there as well for a new vehicle. Yasu worked really hard to ensure that we were satisfied with the deal and also attempted to ensure that he not only worked with us but also considered the fact that we had a limited amount of time due to my health issues. Yasu was available and atentative and insured that the process went smoothly.

The next individual that we would like to compliment was the financial gentleman that assisted us. Mark Anthony took into account that we've been longtime customers and have always relied on Fernandez Honda for all of her vehicle needs. We even have frequently utilized the service department on the regular basis. Mark Anthony worked the best deal out for the term that we wanted and then went so far to rework the deal and it's got us an even better rate. He really not only took the time to help us but went above and beyond in making sure that we were beyond happy with everything that transpired. Honestly I have difficulty in describing the high rate of satisfaction and exemplary service that we received. I don't know to put it into words. Coincidently Mark Anthony was the person I doubt with during my first experience at Fernandez. I remembered him from when I bought my first car there. I appreciated the fact that he recognizes long-term customers and appreciates individuals that come back.

I inquired of the service rep for a sales consultant we could talk with and I meet Tariq Kassam. Being a man of few words I mentioned to Mr. Kassam that I was interested in a bottom line cost for a new Honda Civic with the 2005 as a trade in and what could he do for me. After some small talk getting to know each other, Tariq showed me to a 2012 Civic and explained the many features and safety advantages of this car. We took a test drive and as we went about on the drive Tariq
explained the dash and buttons. We discussed the cost and trade in depth and he provided a list of opitions that were avilable for this car. As the process went I called my wife to let her know the cost and color of the Civic and we agreed on all aspects of the deal with the understanding my wife would have to see and agree to the finial cost and color of the car, I went and pick up my wife in the 2012 Civic and let her drive the car to the dealership upon her agreeing on all aspects of the deal. Now we have another Honda Civic that has more room.

We were starting to get very frustrated because we didn't feel like we were being given a fair deal at every dealership we visited throughout Texas.  Finally, we came across Fernandez Honda!  They were $2300 cheaper than the Dallas area dealerships and $4000 cheaper than all West Texas dealerships!  ""Coach"" gave us a very fair deal online and didn't push us to come in until we were happy.  It was worth the 5 hour drive!  We were treated great and they were just as kind when we didn't finance with them or didn't buy anything extra that they asked us to buy.

Through their drive to create a great customer experience they were able to salvage the glitch and make the sale. As a result I would gladly recommend there services to friends and family who not only want a great vehicle but awesome customer service.

I have been to Gunn Honda with a close friend & was able to see their customer service. I have to say that the customer service was not there.

Although it was unlikely that we would ever return to this particular dealership and knowing our position as retired seniors, they were very fair regarding pricing. But that was not the least of it! Parts were delayed an extra 2 days due to the ice storms around Dallas during the week leading up to Super Bowl Sunday. Obviously, this had nothing to do with any fault by Fernandez Honda. However, as the work was being completed on day 3, and entirely without prompting from us, the very courteous service manager was introduced to us by our service consultant Rudy.

Very courteous and carefully explains what your technicians have found while not trying to push unnecessary repairs on me.  Aaron is an obvious asset to your business and probably deserves a raise!  Well done!

627,"February 12, 2011","I have been taking my Honda Civic and Acura Integra for regular maintenance for over 5 years. Every time I go, I experience great customer service. They take the time to explain what they will be doing to the vehicle, what they suggest, and what they did. They are very transparent and honest with me. When I have a question about my vehicles, Aaron will take the time to answer a call and explain. What other service employee do you know willing to take the time to walk you through how to get into your vehicle after missplacing your keyless entry remote. Its not just about the service you get when you take your vehicle in to the dealership but the service you get around the clock. I wouldn't take my vehicles anywhere else. ",5.0
628,"February 05, 2011",The service I received at Fernandez Honda was top notch.  I would definitely recommend them to any friends or relatives.  They gave great recommendations and multiple options for servicing my vehicle.  I will definitely be back for service or probably to purchase a new car in the near future.  ,5.0

Subject: Another note of appreciation

Mr. Claiborne -

I wanted to write to you to say thank you.  Aaron Sanchez exceeded my expectations once again.  Last week I brought my Honda Odyssey into Fernandez Honda for routine maintenance on the power steering pump, which was making noises. Aaron applied a credit to my billing, because there was a factor recall, which applied to the power steering system. He was honest, and I realize that not everyone in the world volunteers discounts, when they apply.

What is more remarkable is that my front bumper was displaced, and one of the fog lights was broken. Aaron suggested that he make the repairs, since he had good relations with suppliers and contractors to Fernandez Honda.
Aaron promised me a competitive quote, and for less than $300, he found a capable and qualified vendor who repainted, and then re-placed the same bumper to the Odyssey. The vendor also supplied a new fog light. I could not believe my eyes, when I saw my van. The front bumper looked brand new.

What can I say? I've written these emails to you before, but what I want you to know is that solid employees are hard to find. Please pass this note of gratitude to Aaron, and please be aware that he sells value for Fernandez Honda. (I spent over $2,000 on the final billing.) Aaron has convinced me that he will save me money when he can, but that he sells value. Nothing is done on the cheap, but everything is done on value.

What more can I say?  I bought my Odyssey from Fernandez Honda in 2005, and since then I have been a returning customer -- because of Aaron.


Very Respectfully,

630,"February 04, 2011","The staff at Fernandez Honda is knowledgable, courteous, and all service is very prompt. I purchased a car there and would recommend the experience to anyone looking for a new car (or used for that matter). They know their product and ALL service visits since have been great.",5.0
631,"February 03, 2011","There were a couple of problems with my car.  One was fixed promptly, but they couldn't exactly pinpoint what the second problem was.  I appreciated the option of leaving the car longer to try to diagnose rather than just trying to fix things even when they were not sure.  Some mechanics can take advantage of a situation like this and they did not.  Service advisor was very nice and followed up with phone calls when he said he would.  They also had free popcorn and bottled water and a very spacious and upscale waiting area.  Next time I will wait there instead of worrying about getting a ride!",5.0
632,"February 03, 2011","Went there to have my oil changed as it was due. Mr Sanchez recommended that some other work be done.  He was not pushy or demanding but very informative.  Although I did not have the work done at that time, I will be returning to have work done again as Mr Sanchez recommended due to the excellent customer service I received.  ",5.0
633,"February 03, 2011","Fernandez Honda strives to be the best in class and they live up to their expectations.  I've not only purchased my accord there, but I take ""pepper"" (my car) in for regular service maintenance too.  They are professional, courteous, and reliable. Being a female, dealerships and service centers can be intimidating; however, Fernandez Honda has never made me feel uncomfortable.  They go out their way to make sure your car needs are met. I appreciate their award-winning customer service and I am proud to be their regular customer.  Keep up the great work!",5.0
634,"February 03, 2011","Fernandez Honda was an exceptional dealer to work with.  They responded to me with information about inventory in a timely manner.  They were accurate in their description of the vehicle.  Mainly, they made my purchase experience a pleasant one.  Fernandez Honda was very professional throughout the process.",5.0
635,"February 03, 2011","We looked online for our Pilot. There were many cars posted to choose from. In the end we decided on a 2 year old maroon number. We got new tires and it seemed brand new! David and the entire staff were quite helpful. So are the email service reminders. This way, when we are unable to make it to the dealer, we know what service needs to be done and can avoid the ""up sell"" at the quickie lubes. My sister drove down from Dallas to get her new Pilot. gv",5.0
636,"February 03, 2011",I have purchased two used vehicles from Fernandez Honda and have been extremely satisfied with both experiences.  I've also heard the same thing from the people that I referred there.  The prices were reasonable and the salespeople were pleasant and courteous.  There was no rush or pressure.  They let me decide and then helped me make the purchase happen.  I'll go back next time I need a car.,5.0
637,"February 03, 2011","This dealership provides the best customer service around.  They are all extremely helpful and have addressed all my needs at a great value.  Additionally, they do a good job of following up later to make sure that everything was fixed to my satisfaction.  I wouldn't take my car anywhere else.",5.0
638,"December 13, 2010",I just purchased my second Honda from Fernandez Honda a new 2010 Honda Insight - great car. They went out of their way to help me with my purchase. Great dealership they always make me feel at home. I am a single woman and have to rely on the dealership. The service department is fantistic - I would not take my Honda anywhere else. I am blessed to have this dealership to help me.,5.0
639,"December 06, 2010","The Fernandez Honda auto team exemplifies customer service. While treating customers with kindness and respect, Aaron conducts himself as a true professional to make sure that Honda car owners receive quality service in a timely manner. He also takes the time to make customers aware of upcoming service needs. In my most recent visit, Aaron pointed out a few maintenance items that I may want to consider within the next several months. In addition to our discussion, I also came home to find these documented recommendations sent to my personal email. The service team is very trustworthy and honest, and they work very hard to take good care of customers. I always leave with a good feeling about doing business with Fernandez Honda.",5.0
640,"October 14, 2009","This dealership must have changed management. I used to come in here for my oil changes and enjoyed the pleasant atmosphere of its waiting lobby. However, a few weeks ago, I went in for my regular oil change and I immediately noticed the former soothing atmosphere in the lobby was gone. The service staff had no familiar faces at all! But, I figured I was already there, so I went ahead with the oil change. 

As I'm sitting waiting for the oil change, which they said would take 1.5 hours, I am approached by the service guy after about 20 minutes. I was about to be overjoyed, until he tells me that I need a 50000 mile check up (I had just had one @ 45000). I declined, then he tells me that my brakes were worn down & only about 1cm left or something like that. Also, my strut needed to be replaced b/c it's dangerous to even drive a mile! I blew him off & told him I didn't have the $$ over & over before he let it go. I have the $$, but I felt he saw that I'm female and thought I wouldn't be savvy enough to realize he was BS'ing me.

So, through a friend, I found an independent mechanic, who specializes in Lexus, Toyotas & Hondas. When I told him what the service guy said, the mechanic just started laughing! I went to another guy and got the same reaction...in fact, the 2nd independent mechanic told me the brake pad wasn't even close to being as worn down as what I was told. 

DO NOT BE SCAMMED BY THIS DEALERSHIP!!! THEY ARE AWFUL, LYING PEOPLE WHO DESERVE TO ROT IN...well, they deserve to just rot!",1.4
641,"April 23, 2009","I had previously bought a used car from Fernandez Honda and I was happy with the car and service.  (Our original saleman Angel no longer works there.)  We received a letter stating that they wanted to buy back my Honda and that they would put us in a new Honda at a discount price.  Sounds like a good deal.  My husband and I went in to check it out.  I knew that I owed a couple of thousand more on my car than what I could get as a trade in, but I figured that with the discount price on a new car it would still be a good deal.  I was right about the amount being less for the trade in however there was no discount price offered only the MSRP. It was a complete waste of time.   Apparently our salesman told the manager that I wanted a $30,000 vehicle at the same payment as my trade in.  Not true.  He never even showed us a car.  Instead he went straight to figuring out my trade in value while my husband and I walked around looking at the outside of vehicles.  Doesn't sound like a very good sales strategy.  The ""Buy Back Manager"" told us that about 75 people had already come in because of the letter and he was able to get about 15 people into a new car at the same payment. Only about 20% of the customers leave happy!  We weren't and we will never give Fernandez Honda our business again.  On the plus side they were never rude, they just didn't seem interested in selling us a car.    ",2.0
642,"January 22, 2007","I shopped around all over for a 2004 Honda Accord EX Coupe. After I got all my estimates, I called Jaime Anteola, Internet manager at Fernandez Honda. 
He asked me ""What would it take to earn your business.""
I told him I wanted my Honda Accord for $19,200.00 drive out price. He agreed and I showed up the next day with a blank check from capitol one auto finance. 
I highly recommend the blank check system. That way you hold all the cards during negotiatons.
