0,"May 10, 2020","Beware of Hidden fees!!! BAIT & SWITCH!
The price they listed on their website is not what they will quote you in person! I also used the USAA TrueCar app which gives Military discount price but they don’t follow it. What is the point of having those apps as a tool for car buying guide if dealership doesn’t follow it. The salesman and manager will always find a way to make an excuse and blame something like inaccurate prices on USAA TrueCar app that promises accuracy and instant price breakdown on vehicles from dealership that they partnered with. I mean c’mon it’s 2020, stop living like it’s 1985! People can find the answer over the internet nowadays and compare. It’s disappointing and that they treat people like veteran customers with a whopping extra $2100 on the top of a used car valued under $15k!!! By the law, consumers only pay for Tax, Title, and License (registration). Document fees should be at the maximum of $150. I was told that the $2100 is to recoup the cost for the reconditioning of the vehicle and when I checked the battery the sticker was dated 06/18 which is 2 years old!!! Make sure y’all check the battery stickers for date (warranty) and tires are stamped with dates because that’s how manufacturers keep track of the warranty! Don’t let dealership ripoff honest people and don’t let Honda Burleson take your hard earned money. Only pay for what is listed on the website and the Actual Vehicle Value. Any extras like tint, wheel locks, and etc are not required to pay by the law! Dealership installed items are gimmicks! I understand the work that is done but if they are going to charge me extra $2100 for reconditioning then why they didn’t even fix the bumper damage of the car. The only thing that is relevant to the repairs are the new tires and that’s it! When I talked to the manager I told him that I don’t want to pay for dealership fee $2100 because it’s not listed on their website. They will try to argue and show you the generic message (footnotes*) thinking they can somehow make you believe that you are required to pay extra because you are stupid enough not to understand the internet price and basic math! Stop making excuses, be fair and honest to customers. Don’t even mention transparency if you can’t itemized the items for charging extra $2100. It’s a xxxx used car! Not an antique. Car buying experience should be fun but my salesman asks me questions like I’m a dollar sign! Be knowledgeable on the product and explain the functionality of the vehicle before proceeding with the price and then don’t go to your manager when you can’t decide about the final price because you don’t make the finance decisions! You’re a salesman for a reason so earn your title, managers manages employees and not customers! I can’t even imagine how they make sales in new car department...

1,"April 11, 2020",My salesman was Marcus Jamison.  This man is very honest and truly wants to help you get your car with the best deal.  Awesome guy!!! I love Honda of Burleson.  ,5.0
2,"March 12, 2020","The price they advertise online is not what they quote you in person.  We found one of their used cars online and went in to look at it.  I knew there would be extra fees for TTL, but after test driving it we were told the actual price was about $5,000 higher than what it was listed for.  The salesman explained that the additional cost was for the reconditioning fee for work they did on the car to get it ready to sell.  I can understand there being work that needs to be done on the cars and the dealership wanting to recoup that cost.  My issue is why not include that in the advertised price. When we asked our salesman about this he said that no dealership includes that extra cost in their advertised price and if Burleson Honda did no one would come look at their cars because they would be advertised for higher than other dealerships around. I don't know how accurate that statement is.  We felt very deceived.  The added amount took the price out of our budget.   After the back and forth drama that occurs in buying cars they did come down on their price some but we still paid about $2,000 over the advertised price.  Looking back I wish we had got up and walked out but we were in a real crunch with needing a new car.  It just leaves me wondering what else they were deceptive about.  Did they really do the work they claim they did?   As we are starting to look for another used car for my husband we'll look elsewhere since this dealship was deceptive with us.

Felix and Marcus were great, but 2 folks who are not on the list, Kevin Boren and Janett Navarez were fantastic.  We were insistent about getting a red Pilot and even though they did not have one on site, they found one and gave us a loaner and got our price down also.  They went above and beyond.",5.0
18,"July 25, 2019","My name is Stan Waldrip and my wife is Gayle. We decided to stop by Burleson Honda to test drive a new Honda Pilot. We met salesman, Chris Brown. Chris bent over backwards to sell us on the Honda product. He went that extra mile to make sure that we had a pleasant experience.  My wife and I were so excited that we traded our 2015 Acura RDX on a brand new 2019 Honda Pilot!  Thank you Chris Brown for a Great Experience!!",5.0
19,"July 22, 2019","We were shopping for a new car for our 19 year old college student, and wanted to help her start building credit. Diego Barona met us, showed us the new Civics, took time to let her test drive a couple different ones, and answered all our questions and concerns.
We bought a new red civic sport ( Honda’s red is stunning by the way) and the whole process was smooth. Diego made her first time buying a car, a good experience, and made us feel our decision was the best one going with a Honda
Financing was quick and easy with Mike and Dillon 
And the Dealership itself was so nice and comfortable which means a lot because we have our cars serviced at the dealer we get them from
I cannot day enough good things about these guys and Burleson Honda

20,"July 22, 2019","So technically, I've owned a Honda before. My mom passed down Honda Civic to me when I was 17 and it was the first car I ever drove. She bought that car when I was six and I drove it all the way into college. I might still be running for all I know. So my love for Honda runs deep even though this is the first time I ever bought my own. The experience at Burleson was great. I started off online doing my research and was connected with Chris Witherspoon. Being able to email and text message made everything much easier and more convenient during my work hours. Burleson Honda was the least harassing dealership I dealt with during the process and came down lower to beat another quote I had been given. They had the color I wanted, a good price, patient salesman dealing with my schedule, and tasty Muffins with Starbucks coffee in the waiting room. When we got to the finance department I worked with Dylan and he was great as well. Informative of all the warranties but never pushy. When there were mistakes on the paperwork he was never bothered to start over and made sure that everything was perfect and the exact deal I had agreed to. I decided to purchase the mechanical warranty and maintenance plan. I definitely look forward to coming here for all my needs to take care of my new car.",4.6
21,"July 15, 2019","I initially went through the website to ask a few questions. I was quickly connected to my awesome salesman Felix Santos via text, per my request. After answering my questions he asked me to bring my trade in to the dealership for a quote on a trade in. From there is history! I finally got the Honda I have always wanted!!

24,"June 23, 2019","On June 15, 2019, my wife and I drove all the way to Burleson Honda from Lewisville, Texas to look at a 2018 Toyota RAV4.  That day, I contacted Burleson Honda and had the pleasure of talking to Jerry Leverett.  Jerry advised the RAV4 was available and he would run it through the car wash if I was planing on visiting.  After arriving at the dealership we were immediately met by Jerry who showed us the RAV4 and a Honda CRV to compare.  At the end of the day we bought the RAV4 and drove it home that evening after agreeing to a reasonable price with Benjamin Bazi.  Both Jerry and Ben were professional and did not use pressure tactics.  The entire transaction took approximately 3 hours it was fast and efficient.  Thank you Honda of Burleson!",5.0

48,"March 04, 2019","Fern Salas is the person to go to for the most relaxed purchase experience. It started last year when I was just perusing through the dealership lot and he was the one that greeted me. We kept in contact and respected my preferred method of being contacted and the timelines that I set for him on when to contact me. This past weekend I went to purchase a Red Tag Accord Sport 2.0, he let me test drive it like it was my first-time test driving the vehicle. I went the following day to make the purchase but I found out about the disappearance of the Lifetime Warranty.  It was a shock, and I hesitated to continue with the purchase. Fern didn't pressure me to close the deal that day because he didn't want me to have buyer's remorse. I came back and purchased the vehicle today. No Buyer's remorse here. ",5.0
49,"March 03, 2019","I purchased a 2019 fro Burleson Honda on 2/28/19. I looked at several vehicles at this dealership as well as several others.  This dealership was given a high recommendation by one of my neighbors and from what I experienced, I agree with the high rating. 

My salesman at Burleson Honda was Diego Barona and I thoroughly enjoyed working with him.  He was low key, knowledgeable of the Honda line, and answered many questions concerning the vehicles I was interested in.  When I changed my mind and switched vehicles to the Pilot, he quickly showed me options to meet my needs I discussed. 

All in all he was very knowledgeable, very courteous, and enjoyable to deal with. I highly recommend choosing him as your salesman if you need one.  Additionally, I found all other employees at this dealership, including Kevin Baker (New Car Sales Manager) and Jeremy Hann (Service Manager) equally knowledgeable and friendly. 

Overall a great place to buy your next new vehicle. ",5.0

51,"February 28, 2019","BUYERS PLEASE BEWARE OF THIS DEALERSHIP!!!! PLEASE DO NOT LOOK AT THEIR GOOD RATING, WHICH IS SURPRISING!!!! PLEASE DO NOT DO ANY BUSINESS WITH THESE CROOKS!!!! THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME I'M BUYING CAR. I WILL PAY MORE MONEY TO SOME OTHER DEALERSHIP, BUT NOT TO BURLESON HONDA!!!!  ( I KNOW THIS REVIEW IS LONG BUT IT WILL SAVE YOU TIME AND RESPECT) PLEASE READ THE REVIEW!!
In my dealings with multiple dealerships, this was the far most worst experience ever. My family has owned Honda for years and that's all my family drives. 
I went to buy a car from them and test drove couple of them. Finally made a choice and told them to bring the numbers. They offered the vehicle for $17995 and these guys bring me the numbers for $24,600. What is kind of deal is this. They hide hidden numbers, without asking me they added $3000 as a warranty on A CERTIFIED USED HONDA!!!! I walked out of the dealership, but Jose Fuentes, the sales manager, came running after us in the parking lot asking for our business. We agreed on the negotiated price. Now came time for finance. They would not agree on the finance rate. We told them we would do cash out buy and they agreed. During all this time they were taking soooooo long to do things, it was time for me to go to work. We agreed that we pay the down payment and come on Monday and finish the final document signing. 
Come Monday, the sales man came and asked me if I still wanted to finance? I thought they are my neighborhood dealership they should get business as well so I agreed to finance. Over the weekend they offered an interest rate, which was within our range. So I told them give me the same  interest rate, I will finance. Marcus McRae, the finance director, who should really apologize the way he behaved approached me and said flat out NO they will not offer the interest rate. This really upset me. I told them what happened to paper on which took my sign and they offered the deal on Saturday. He thought that i would not ask for it. I asked them to call Jose and he  comes and tells me, ""Oh that was just estimate deal"". Folks we are business operating family, when the deal is on the table its a solid when agreed upon. Because Jose Fuentes, on Saturday told me if I increase the down payment he would get me the interest rate, which I did and agreed to pay more down payment. My uncle was with me and he said we would pay the down payment through the company business card. On Saturday, they agreed to charge the credit card. But fast-forward Monday, we were made to sit around for an hour, THE SALES MAN, Allanzo, says he will assist to sign MY finance papers because all the other ""Finance Managers are busy on calls"". A sales man, where is the respect to the customer. After all the paper work is finished Allonzo tell me they cannot charge the card provided. They cannot charge $4000 on a company card because they got new GM and he changed the rules. What kind of business are these guys running. I told them I would give them my company check. I had to drive to 45 mins each way to and fro to get my company check because I did not have access to my personal check with me. I come back and give them the check, they tell me no we cant take the check after 45 mins. This really angered me. They are playing jokes with the customers. Folks, now this had become a very painstaking process. I told them will they charge my personal American Express which they did. Now when I asked Marcus McRae, why wasn’t there a finance manager signing my papers his excuse was that Allonzo is a finance manager in training, which for no reason he could answer any of my questions. I'm an educated person who knows how a person becomes finance manager, being in the business world for so long. Marcus went on to even say why I was starting something, when there is nothing, stating that a salesperson signing my finance document who is not a certified finance manager. Now why would anyone make any business deals with this place, which shows such disrespect and contempt to their customers? Please make a wise choice and avoid this dealership",1.0

This is a large, clean, professional place to buy a car.

58,"February 01, 2019","I originally was planned to buy a Civic from a local Honda dealership in North Richland Hills, which is a lot closer to the house, but a coworker directed me to Burleson Honda because of their lifetime warranty options. And let me say I haven't seen or heard of any warranties that come close. 
So I got online and found a similar Civic I was looking at NRH Honda and contacted Mike Pham. After a very brief description of what I was looking for, Mike was off and running. We set up a time to look and possibly buy the car on the spot. Mike was GREAT. Had the car ready and paper work in order, along with any questions I had. One problem...I had a rental car I had been driving around in for two weeks and wasn't able to take the car. Mike went way beyond what I'm sure he needed to and offered to drop it off for me in the morning. I drove the car home that night.

I also have to give xxxxxxto the finance manager, Mr. Craine for being a cool, down to earth guy. VERY PERSONABLE, and not your typical smug finance guy that just wants to sell a warranty package. Plus they already offer LifeTime on your PowerTrains.
With that being said......the enhanced warranty package sells itself. 

YOU WILL NOT FIND ANOTHER DEALERSHIP WITH BETTER LIFETIME WARRANTY OPTIONS

Love this place.....lets hope their service dept. is as impressive. (we'll see soon enough)

62,"January 16, 2019","Purchased a Honda Pilot in early December. Salesman was nice. However after sale, service is awful. Never received license plates for vehicle from dealer. Called and emailed several dealer personnel numerous times for status of plates. Dealer did not return calls or emails. Finally, personally went to tax office to purchase my plates on last day of temporary tags. After approving financing through Honda at dealership, several weeks later I received a letter from Burleson Honda that they could not honor financing because my credit score was too low. I have an excellent credit score that is in the mid 800's. Emailed the finance manager, salesman, and general sales manager to find out what was going on since I had already made a monthly payment, down payment, and trade in. They never responded to my emails. Due to my business, I purchase numerous cars and trucks from dealers annually. In 49 years of purchasing vehicles from many dealers, this is the worst experience and dealer I have ever encountered.",1.6
63,"January 16, 2019","We spent quite a few hours with Allonzo test driving cars and taking home the one we ultimately decided on. The time just flew by, Allonzo is so nice and laid back it felt like we were hanging out with an old friend. My wife and I couldn't have had a more pleasant time and we were both more than happy to leave with the car we wanted thanks to him. Everyone one else we spoke to at Honda Burelson were also super friendly, T.J for example helped finalize our sale and again he was friendly and awesome to talk to. 

Overall just a great experience. We live about 30 minutes away in Fort Worth and became tried of the pushy salesmen near us. We decided to drive down to Burelson and try our luck there and we left with a new car the same day. Thank you!",5.0
64,"January 02, 2019","Six months ago, I bought a 2018 Honda Civic LX-P from Clark Bartlett and I had the best car buying experience. 

Unfortunately, that Civic was totaled out a couple weeks ago because some deer ran out in the road and... I nailed one. I was in the market for another new car, and I didn't even consider anything or anyone else but Burleson Honda.

I contacted Clark; we got together, and once again, he made my car buying experience more than exceptional. Clark has had my best interests at heart both times and it has been noticeable. It was so noticeable the first time I bought, that I knew I wouldn't buy a car from anyone else. I purchased a 2019 Honda Civic LX from Clark Bartlett.

I am a young lady, coming out from divorce and getting back on my own two feet... becoming independent all over again.
I thought that I would end up financially screwed because I didn't have the down payment as before, and no co-signer. I had doubts, you could say. However, Burleson Honda once again made it a painless, easy, and downright beneficial experience for me. ",5.0
65,"December 03, 2018","My experience with this dealership was totally different from any other dealership I have visited. Charlie Martinez was my sales representative, and he did an amazing job of finding a car that met my needs and budget. Before I left, I notice some white paint on my car and informed Charlie about it. He told me to come back in a few days and he would have someone get that off for me. I come back a few days later and Charlie true to his word had someone get the paint off. Not only did he help with the paint situation but he also had my car washed and put gas in my tank.

Marcus McCrae assisted on the financial side by explaining my options ,contracts,and addressed my concerns. He was very patient with me with all my questions and gave me advice for being a first time car buyer.

 Both of them were friendly and their willingness to help me exceeded my expectations. I did not feel pressured one bit about buying the car like at most dealerships.  They definitely made my first car buying experience nice and easy, and I would definitely recommend this dealership to others!",5.0

93,"July 24, 2018","Was in the market for a new car for my family. Test drove a few makes and models of SUV's and kept coming back to the Pilot since my family has had little to no troubles with Honda's in the past. Since I knew exactly what I wanted and the budget I wanted to keep, I felt I didn't need to spend a whole day in a dealership. Since the Pilot felt great driving, I knew exactly what I wanted as far as trim level, colors, warranties, pricing, etc. I noticed that there was quite a few new 2017 Pilots still on various lots around the metroplex. I had no issues with a car manufactured last year since the 2018 had not changed and the warranties still began the same day I drove off the lot.  I figured these dealerships would love to sell me one of these to make space for a current year. I reached out to five different Honda dealerships in the DFW area to obtain best pricing. I was amazed that only one dealership would send me any quotes and do any kind of serious negotiations online. A sales rep from one dealership would only tell me if I was in the"" ballpark"" to a price I wanted in an email but never gave me a price. The same rep began texting me and I advised him I was not coming to the dealership until we spoke of hard price online. I was advised it was against the dealership policy to do any negotiations online and could not send any quotes. A sales manager from the same dealership followed up by sending me a couple of text messages, I told him the same thing I needed a hard price to work off of. He asked me what my price was, his response was only a range of $5-6K more the price I knew was good and fair, that was not in the my ""Ballpark"". Thankfully I did not waste my time and energy initially going to that dealership, I am pretty sure I would not have been a happy camper with a final price. Burleson Honda had no issues with sending me multiple quotes, going back and forth until both parties came to an agreement. Was also able to handle all of the financing online.  I simply showed up to the dealership, drove the vehicle around the block, signed papers with the sales rep and finance manager, and drove away happy. The process took a little over an hour to complete in person. I understand dealerships still prefer for customers to show up in person for the complete sales process but in today's technology, consumers can do all the research before stepping foot in a dealership at a much quicker pace and more thoroughly. Pricing comparisons,  dealership reviews, financing, car reviews are all available online for consumers to review simply by going to a search engine. If I know exactly what I want and know what is a good price, there shouldn't be much wasted time and energy dealing with a dealership. The longest part should be the test drive! Thank you Burleson Honda for making my car buying experience very positive, I look forward to dealing with you again in the near future. ",5.0

The first time I bought a lemon so I went into this with extreme skepticism and my reservations however I desperately needed a new car. I’ve had my eye on the Honda Fit for a long time and knew if I found the right one for the right price I would drive it off the lot. My brother did some research on my behalf and found exactly what I was looking for at Honda Burleson! I worked with Cesar ( who happened to be on his first day at this location) and was immediately greeted with welcomed enthusiasm. He listened to my needs and worked with me to make sure I was 100% satisfied with my purchase. I also had a very specific budget I was working with. He was able to get me off the lot for even less than I anticipated! Finance worked with me too. I bought the car cash but had to wait for a check to clear. I paid a portion and the rest the week after I came back from a trip out of town with no issues. The next day I drove it to Houston for a family event. It drove like a dream! The only thing I noticed was the dome light didn’t come on. When I took it back to give them my check, I told Cesar what was up. Without hesitation he took it to service and the fixed it right away! I am madly in love with my fit. I work as a professional makeup artist. I went to my first gig this weekend and was able to fit a directors chair, large training kit, Popup light, computer bag and some clothes all in the hatch back with room to spare!

As a woman, I was anxious about having to go through this challenge. But my treatment at Burleson Honda was completely respectful and empowering. From the beginning of the process in communicating with the virtual sales manager, Katie Santos, to actually purchasing my car with the help of my outstanding salesperson Justin Donelson, I felt valued and important. 

This dealership really stood by their word through every stage of my purchase: from honoring their price without tricky add-on's, to finding my perfect car quickly so I did not have to wait and worry. Katie and Justin kept in constant touch with me to let me know what was happening. Most importantly, when I arrived at the dealership to pick up my car, it was ready and in beautiful condition, and the paperwork was a breeze.

Burleson Honda has my loyalty and ongoing business, and I would never hesitate to recommend them to others.

Wouldn't you know it, he said let me go talk to my manager. He said they hadn't run my credit yet. So this 12% was based on what? Trying to scam someone? I had already told them that I have PTSD and wouldn't be able to haggle. As I tried to leave I was chased down in the parking lot and yelled at and called rude. After I left they called and said they didn't realize I was a VIP and that they could give me what I asked for in cost and APR. Too late. I went to another dealership and without a moment of haggling had the price and APR I wanted. Today I got a letter in the mail stating they couldn't approve my credit.

As another opportunity arose this year for another accessible van, I reached out hoping the last experience was a fluke but it was apparent the dealership has made no effort to treat those with disabilities with respect.
I may be only one customer but the availability of a much larger network to those with disabilities is significant.

All I know is when I take my car to the dealership I take it for them to physically look at my car and for them to tell me what it needs, not for them to pull an assumption out of their xxx.

137,"May 27, 2017","When I initially came in, I came in thinking I was going only for an oil change, until my service agent made me aware that we also needed the 90,000 mile maintenance done. When I asked what that included he said the oil change, tire rotation, air filters changed and coolant fluid changed. I was expecting the oil change and so it wasn't that much more, so why not, when I asked the agent the cost he said 84.95, and it would take 4-5 hours. Agent offered either a shuttle, or possible a loaner, which loaner is what we did. This started at 10:30 for the drop, at 4, I hadn't heard back, so I called to see the status, he said they were just about wrapping up, he would call me when done. Shortly after, service agent called back, said car was being washed and we could pick the car up. I was busy, and sent my husband to get the car, to his surprise the bill was $800+ so he called to verify with me that that was correct. I told him that that was definitely NOT the price I was quoted, but 84.95 plus 20 for something else that I can't recall. My husband explained this to Eric, and I could hear Eric explaining to my husband how much each of these things were. This explanation of cost was not reviewed with my, I was just given a straight price. After asking to speak to a manager, we talked to Jim the service manager, I told him exactly what happened and he was able to honor the original price quoted. We really do appreciate how Jim handled things. At this point, in the future I will ask how much things cost individually to assure no miscommunication so that this doesn't happen again, but also a learning tool for the service agents to not just quote one price, but review each service cost so that the customer know how much things are and where their money is going.

We were not even introduced to anyone in the service department nor offered any incentives to bring the Pilot back for service.  In fact, no one even said ""thank you"" for our $40,000 purchase.  The dealership offered me a price on my trade-in and then lowered the offer, stating it could not be sold on the lot but would have to be taken to auction because of a slight repair where a dog ran into the fender.  When I went back to the dealership for a service issue, my trade-in was on their used car lot for sale (and after talking to a friend of mine this dealership told them the same thing about their car).

201,"March 17, 2017","The good: the list price for the 2014 Honda Odyssey was relatively low, so I drove from Oklahoma to check it out. The list prices for the Honda Odyssey are higher than the retail blue book value. I was wrong in looking up the blue book value for this Odyssey having an alloy wheel option, which it didn't have, making the blue book value even lower than the list price.

The bad: there is a lot of it, and there is no excuse. Carl Rathburn, before I drove 5 hours, told me on the phone that as an out of state customer, I could finance using any bank in Texas. I am a USAA member, and USAA IS based in Texas, and therefore it was easy to think I could buy using financing through USAA. Carl told me it would be accepted. Then I get there, and was informed by Carl and a sales manager that they could not take my USAA financing, because I lived in Oklahoma, and that it was a company rule. The reasons: IF the payment didn't work, then they could not easily come to Oklahoma to take back the van I would have just bought, and so they cannot take USAA customers from outside Texas. Never mind that you could drive 5 hours within Texas. So that was a crap reason for the company rule. Now for the additional facts: Honda of Burleson is a USAA Certified Dealer. I found the van I purchased through USAA's Car Buying Service, which gave me a price. Honda of Burleson is supposed to honor their agreement with USAA and accept USAA financing, and for me, they did not, violating their deal they have with USAA. I was instead stuck with their dealer financing, not in a position to apply to any other Texas-based banks' loans due to time, and their dealer financing was an entire 1.99% higher APR than my pre-approved USAA loan.

The cherry on top, the rub my face in the dirt, is that their dealer financing bank, TD Auto Finance, has no location in Texas. On the TD website, they have locations to contact them in Michigan, Maine, and South Carolina.

Later, when I got my permanent license plate, I discovered the screws for the license plate do not match up with the holes, so you can only just start to screw them in.

Also, they did not come down on their list price at all after I counter-offered, so other Honda shoppers will want to remember that if they shop at Honda of Burleson. My reasons why they should have were that it was missing a key ($200 or so to replace) and there were about 800 more miles than they listed it as having. It was also above the retail value by I think at least $2000, however, I did not mention that like I should have.

My experience with Honda of Burleson was dissatisfactory. Carl Rathburn, at best, was too lazy to figure out that they would not accept my USAA financing before I visited, and at worst, lied about it to get me to come see the van. I do not know which it was. And it is a lie that I was going to be required to use a bank based in Texas when Honda of Burleson hypocritically does not have a dealer financer based in Texas. Unfortunately, I have to admit I was screwed and I regret making the deal, which is partly my own fault, I know.",2.3

211,"March 02, 2017","My daughter was driving in from Louisiana over this past weekend when her steering column started smoking. Needless to say, this was the final straw. I was not about to send my daughter and grandson back home in that car. We did a quick search online at a dealership that I respect and use. They had a couple of used Hondas that she wanted to look at Saturday morning. We stopped in Friday night here in Burleson, where's we meet a wonderful young man named Derek who was willing to help her look at the type car she wanted even knowing that we were going somewhere else. Needless to say Saturday after looking at the other dealership's offering, she got back on line for the Burleson Honda dealership, found a Toyota that was a better fit and we came back home. Even though they are a Honda dealership we were able to get the car she wanted WITH the lifetime power train warranty at a better deal. Tim Bae and the guys even worked out a fabulous finance deal due to this being an unplanned purchase.  We will definitely be back!!!!",5.0

217,"February 21, 2017","Although I scheduled a service appointment for 3:45 and arrived at that exact time, there was no one to greet me at the service drive. I had not specified an advisor because I just needed a standard oil and filter change along with a tire rotation. It was around 4:00 before Andre was assigned to me and handled the appointment. He was very friendly and did everything he could to help me out with the costs of the service. 

The BUT in my review title refers not to the advisor or the actual service which were both excellent, but to the dealerships (or perhaps Honda's) policy of sending out coupons that are ineffective for my vehicle. You would think that with all of the detail they already have on my vehicle, they would send a coupon I could actually use! I am specifically referring to a coupon that shows a cost of $29.95 for an oil and filter change. But in the small print it says ""additional charge for synthetic oil"". Well, of course my vehicle uses synthetic oil. (Which I believe all newer model Hondas are equipped with). So, instead of an expected cost of $29.95, the cost for the synthetic oil change is $49.95. This difference in cost should be noted in LARGE BOLD PRINT not small print on the coupon. Better yet, don't send me a coupon that I cannot use! Send me a coupon for changing synthetic oil or don't send me a coupon at all!

Too bad marketing cannot be as good as the service. ",4.2
218,"February 21, 2017","We received excellent service for the oil change and inspection of our CR-V. The only negative is that when driving up to the service area it's not clear which lanes to use and which to avoid. There are three lanes under the covered area, and evidently they use the left two lanes for incoming vehicles, and the right lane (as you look at the area from the front) for the outgoing vehicles. However, people were parking their cars in all three lanes. Very confusing, and something that some simple signage would help to alleviate.",4.4
219,"February 19, 2017",They go the extra way to make sure I utilitize my time there by making sure all my recalls are done.  They make sure all my request are done cause I made sure to let them know cause last time they forgot to rotate my daughters tires and mine during an oil change. ,5.0

Then in the afternoon he said the car has arrived and will take couple of hours to get it inspected and install the accessories.

Matthew took me and my friends out to show the car and took a test drive, everything was perfect. Then did some paperwork and he introduced me to Mike Dowdle ( From Finance) to do the reset of the paper work. He is so good at what he does and he is so fast with all the paperwork (I Dont know how he does that). By 7:45 PM i was out of the dealership with the New Car. My friend who joined me to take the delivery of the car was shocked, he has brought 4 New car and it took 4 hours minimum time to get a new car and he said to me the next honda car he is going to buy from you guys.

Best thing what i liked about your Team is they never tried to sell me anything and the whole experience was amazing.

I would really like to appreciate Matthew and Mike for their great work.",5.0

However,  they did not clean the inside of my car after the sale, no big deal I thought.  I removed the crayons and toys from under the seat and cleaned the interior.  However, when I recently started having a commonly known issue with 2012 Pilots (I known now!) I took my car to the dealership for a diagnostic.  I was told it wasn't the issue the engine code brought back but probably bad gas.  A week later, I paid out $400 to have the code issue (cylinder 3 misfire) fixed by Kwik Kar.  I am now dealing with another cylinder head going out.  Not a happy customer, when I am I give credit where due.  Not here!

However, Brandon was very up front and quoted the lowest drive out price I received from anyone.  He assured me there would be no hidden costs and no games when it came time to sign the paperwork.  Additionally, there was no pressure to hurry in or the quote would expire.  Sure enough when I went to sign and pickup the car, it was exactly what we agreed. I was in and out very quickly.

A week or so later, Brandon touched base with me to ensure everything was great with the car.  I explained we had a problem with the tint on the back glass.  We set up an appointment to bring the car in.  In 30 minutes he had the tint fixed and also brought the car back washed, cleaned the interior, and also filled it up with gas.  Totally unexpected.

302,"August 18, 2016","We purchased my wife's 2014 Accord from HoB and were overall very pleased with the sales staff.  At the time of purchase we were talked into purchasing a service contract based on an assurance that the vehicle required synthetic oil, which made the service contract reasonably priced.  After we had a chance to read the owners' manual we learned that synthetic oil was not required or recommended, but my wife elected to keep the service contract anyway.  After her most recent visit for an oil change I noticed an oil stain on the garage floor the next day.  Thinking perhaps that some oil had spilled and dripped off the bottom of the car I just cleaned up the spill.  However, the next day there was another oil stain under the car.  I put the car up on jack stands and discovered that the oil pan drain bolt wasn't even finger tight.  I tightened the drain bolt and cleaned the mess off the floor and the bottom of the oil pan.  I called HoB and left a phone message for the Service Manager to call me back, as I thought he should be aware of the situation.  It's been over 6 weeks and he's never returned the phone call.  My wife was displeased enough that she wrote a letter to the General Manager requesting cancellation of the service contract and explaining why.  She faxed the letter to HoB and received a fax confirmation, but there has never been any response from the dealership.  We did subsequently receive a partial refund from Honda on the service contract, but my wife is so soured by her service experiences and the dealership's lack of response when contacted that she said she wouldn't consider buying another car from HoB.

305,"August 08, 2016","I purchased my 2013 Honda Civic on March 22, 2013 and at that time I also purchased the Honda Maintenance Package for 6 Years / 80k Miles. My sales guy, Staven Corey was flat out AMAZING!!! Staying hours past closing to make sure I was taken care of.  However, since that time, every single time I come in, Honda of Burleson does not show record that I have purchased this Honda Vehicle Maintenance Package.  Every single time I come in, I have to argue with Honda of Burleson about what I have paid for and what it covers with proof from my paperwork.  Every single time I come in, Honda of Burleson states that they have put added notes on my account and this won't happen again.  Every single time I come in, I bring my full folder of records with me that have the proof with the written print out from their own database as to the ""special note"" Honda of Burleson put in on my account/in to the database that should resolve all issues.  

This has been going on for over 3 Years!!!  After 11 appointments, I have am very frustrated and will leave negative reviews online so that others see how horrible they are at following through with a customer after a sale.

I have spoken to Management / Leadership 3 different times asking this to be fixed one final time.  On top of speaking with the service representatives (Scott Lyons, Kale Moreland, John Moreno, Samuel Maldonado, Tracy Shipman, Zachary White) and clerks at checkout each and every single time I come in.  And let's not forget the numerous text message conversations with Kailey, the person who follows up with me via text each and every time I have service, begging me to please fill out the survey if I get one. The last time I contacted Kailey, she said I would hear from management. I asked to hear within 3 days of our conversation.  It has been over a week and as of yet I have not received a text message, email, letter or phone call.  This is absolutely unacceptable and extremely poor for your own staff to promise things that you as management do not follow through on.  However, I am not surprised.  I have gotten lots and lots of promises from you and you have yet to keep one of them. 

Please know, if I EVER get a survey, it will be filled out, but I will not be like others who do not authentically disclose the issues I have with Honda of Burleson and the areas they need to improve for anyone and everyone to see. I will be honest and I will write a thorough review.  I will not be giving anyone outside of Staven Corey an excellent review.  Staven was amazing, staying hours past closing to make me a happy customer.  Always wanting me to stop and say hello when I am there.  Always caring about what is going on in my life not just how my Honda Civic is doing for me.  Honda of Burleson Management need to take lessons from him.",1.6

I sent an inquiry on a CPO car on their lot and was promptly replied by Carl R.  Through emails I discussed with him that I was very busy at work and with the kids, but that I was very interested in this certain car.  I verified that it was in fact a CPO car, mostly due to another individuals review that she was sold a car believed to be CPO and was not (you can read that review here on Dealer Rater as well), in which he assured me it would be.  So I stated that I was bringing my own funding and wanted the full price of the vehicle so that I could be prepared and ready to go if the car was to my liking.  Here is when the bomb dropped for me, nearly $2000 was being charge above and beyond the internet pricing for ""Certification"" fees.  Not only is this a ridiculous mark up to call the car ""CPO"", but even more ridiculous on a 4 year old car!!!  I currently own a car very similar to the one I inquired about and could not believe what the total price of their car was to be, the TRUE price, not the one advertised.  Carl assured me they would not lose my business over ""a couple of hundred dollars"", his words.  Well maybe not over a couple of hundred, but most surely over 2 grand!!!

They make you feel welcomed every time. A special thank you to Jim Orta and Ralph Labault for making my visit there a pleasure. Hands down the best dealership in Burleson!!!

340,"March 28, 2016","I just purchased my 4th new Honda from HOB. Three of my purchases were with TJ Brewington when he was ins sales prior to moving up into the finance dept. He is simply a great guy and straight shooter with no hassle pricing and exceptional service. And with my 4th recent purchase I had the privilege to meet Fernando (FERN) Salas my new sales rep. who replicated the same great service as I have always received. He is personable, respectful, patient and upfront and that is why I keep going back to HOB and referring friends to them. I highly suggest you stop by and say hi to FERN on your next purchase.

Best Regards,
Kirk Koehler

341,"March 26, 2016",Brandon was very helpful & patient. This is my second car to buy from Honda of Burleson and I was even more amazed the second go round! He found me exactly what I needed and helped me stay within my budget! He also delivered my car to me because I have been without one! Everyone I worked with was very helpful and made a usually very stressful situation easy and smooth. I will definitely return here for my next vehicle! ,5.0

He knew everything about the car we were interested in and gave us the best advice to trade in our current Honda CRV and lease the new Pilot. On a scale of 1-10 I would give Billy and Mike Dowdle a 10 for their service, care, and respect provided during our new care leasing experience. We felt very comfortable and at ease throughout the process. I never felt pressured or pushed into any decision. I also was glad that the purchase did not take all day to complete. Please let both of them know how great they were and how much we appreciated their kindness and professionalism. ",5.0

353,"February 24, 2016","Where do I start with this dealership.  First, I'll address the pros.  The building was very modern and clean.  Definitely was a pleasant environment to sit in.   However, that's it.  Cons, were many.  So I found a used vehicle online which was absolutely perfect in terms of what I was looking for.  Scheduled a test drive and again was pleased with it.  But after inspection found various body damage on the vehicle.  Requested that the price be dropped down and was obviously met with opposition. Ok, not a big deal.  I felt I was still getting a good deal regardless.  Still moved forward to financing the vehicle.  After wasting 3 hours at the dealership with our salesman I was told that me and my cosigner had to provide proof of income along with other documentation before the bank approved.  We were assured that we were going to be approved.  Although I am sub-prime borrower due to my divorce all my vehicle payment histories have been on time and my cosigner's credit was perfect.  No worries right? Wrong.  The next day after emailing all the documentation requested I find out the salesman was sick.  But, he had another one to cover down for him.  Unfortunately this salesman never answered his phone, nor put any effort into finishing the deal.  So after submitting numerous documents for income and proof of residency ( even though we are military and only staying in town for three months).  We finally got an answer back that financing was rejected.  Now granted, we were putting money down on this vehicle and I just sold my car to another dealership.  However, they tried using a local credit union to finance a vehicle and insisted that we provide proof of residency.  I told these guys in the beginning that I was plating the car in my home state. But, they kept pushing that I get Texas plates.  Why would I get plates for a state I'm just visiting and happen to find a good deal? Now back home we were approved for financing for 35k on a 2016 truck at the Dodge dealership, but here in Burleson we get rejected for a 25,000 used truck? Doesn't make any sense.  
I don't know how new sales is, so I won't generalize on it.  However, do not go here for a used vehicle.  The salesman will not negotiate, they will lie to you along with wasting your time, lack of communication, even how they linger at the door deters people away, and the dealership lacks lender resources.  I like the state of Texas, but I hope this dealership isn't an example of how car selling is done here.  Thank you. ",1.6
354,"February 21, 2016","5 stars for brandon lane and Honda or burleson. Keep and my gf where first time car buys he made this experience totally painless.  Didn't try and push a single thing on us. Not once did I feel uncomfortable during the entire process. We came in gave him the car color and everything we wanted down to the vin number, didn't try and push more expensive cars or features that we didn't need or want. Walked us through the best financing  which we would be best for us and our budget.  Totally layed back experience.  I can't stress this enough ,Honda of burleson is where I will do all my future maintenance on my car and buy another car now the future. Just for the customer service alone.

358,"February 15, 2016","Purchased a new 2016 Pilot from Billy Mitchell.  Billy was very courteous and helpful throughout the looking and purchase process.
We tried two other dealers much closer to our house first.  One berated and insulted us both on the used and new car lot and the other wouldn't negotiate on price--neither was the case at Honda of Burleson.  Every employee was courteous and they were willing to negotiate the price enough to make my wife and I happy.  I will be sending my friends on the 1-1/2hr trip to this location from now on.

Mike Dowdle in the Finance Dept. was also very courteous and didn't play any of the typical 'financing games'.

My husband and I were sure they would try and play games once they had us there and we would return home w our old car. They did not, and we drive back w tons of room and a smooth, nice, new ride. They did have to make a minor adjustment to the trade in, but we told them to be fair or we are leaving. They were very fair, and in their defense it has to be very hard to give a trade-in value car unseen. They gave us a fair new trade in and we accepted. We were in and out and the most amazing part is we SAVED SO MUCH MONEY going here!!! Even if you include our hotel and meals, we still saved a bunch. Our small town local dealer could not compete at all!!! Brandon was honest and wonderful and when my husband needs a new car, we will be locating Brandon Lane and calling him first!!! Thanks Brandon!

Just one less thing for me to fuss with, especially with a 2 year old! After a bit of wait to meet with Joey to get the financing finalized, it was refreshing to speak to someone who was so candid about the process and even helped us out with adding on the service package for very little extra cash per month.

We love Honda of Burleson.  I have used this dealership for maintenance since they opened. We decided to purchase an inexpensive reliable used car as a back-up vehicle.  Our salesperson, David Kraning, was very professional and knowledgeable.  His main goal was to meet the customers needs. He did not try to pressure us to buy a vehicle that was outside of our budget. Overall, this was a very pleasant buying experience.

Weeks later paint started to chip off from front bumper and upon more inspection, noticed the hood had been replaced, rear door on driver didn't align, hood didn't align, and when I returned they offered me less than what I paid, plus out my down payment, and all other fees I was charged.I was lied about this car not having any reports. I went with a new car and was presented with a final price and upon signing papers and asked what the price was it went up $3000, so once that got corrected overlooked paperwork again and the new paperwork showed our interest rate going up with out being told.

372,"January 25, 2016","My wife and I were looking for a used Honda Pilot with low mileage. We live in SW Fort Worth and we were driving home from dinner and saw online that Honda of Burleson had a vehicle on their lot that we were interested in. We stopped by Saturday evening about an hour before closing and Tim Bae set us up for a very brief test drive as we had to get home to our kids. On Monday morning I took off from work and though Tim was not available, another associate-Don-was more than happy to help until Tim arrived. The staff new I had to be at work soon and they did their best to help entertain my 2 year old and 2 month old while we were there. After agreeing to purchase the car, TJ helped us in the finance office. He recognized that the kids were not going to last much longer and I was running late to work so we zipped through all the paper work and we were out the door. I bought a vehicle in the past from a family friend who was a finance manager at a dealership in Dallas and even with the inside help, it did not go as smoothly and efficiently as this purchase did.

379,"January 07, 2016","There is a reason why this dealership has very competitive prices. They purchase their used vehicles in auctions. From there, they do none to very little maintanance work on the cars. I purchased a 2013 Honda Civic with 16k miles. After 15 minutes of driving the vehicle off the lot I had a TPMS service light come on. also, the vehicle was not cleaned from the interior as I specifically asked them to do. I took my car to another Honda dealership to service the TPMS light. There they told me that the vehicle had actually been in some sort of accident because it has a replacement front bumper and the quarter panel was not flush with the door. Even though the car fax showed no accidents, and no airbag deployment. The sales personnel is friendly and all, but they sell poor uplift vehicles.

I told Billy I wanted a price check and showed the lowest price I've gotten so far for the 2015 Honda Civic EX. I steeled myself for a listing price of a couple hundred dollars above what I gave them, due to their free Lifetime Powertrain Warranty. To my surprise and disbelief, I was given an OTD price lower than what I've gotten! With that price, the Lifetime Powertrain Warranty, cleanliness of the dealership (plus the free coffe and etc.) and the friendliness of the staff, I had to say 'Yes To The Car' of course! Billy helped my brother and I fill out the sales forms, answered our questions, test drive and explained the car and was extremely helpful. TJ was also extremely helpful with the financial part.

416,"September 18, 2015","Dear Readers:

On Wednesday, September 16, I went to Honda of Burleson to trade in my 2012 Honda Accord. Since the warranty was about to expire, I wanted to get a new Honda for the same payments I'd been making. 

I called and spoke with Taylor.  She was waiting on us when we walked into the showroom.  From start to finish, she was courteous, knowledgeable, and professional.  She worked hard to get me exactly what I wanted.  It took several times going back and forth with one of the Sales Managers to meet my expectations, but she did it! Thank you, Taylor! 

I also want to commend the young man with whom she was working, Tim.  While new, he was also courteous and professional. Both of these young people represented themselves and dealership with integrity and poise.

For many years I have worked with a well-known leasing company in the DFW area, but they were unable to meet my expectations, so I took my business elsewhere. I decided to give Honda of Burleson a try, and I was so glad, too!

I walked out a very happy customer. I love my new Honda 2015, the champagne color is classy, and the newer, up-to-date features are great.  Honda is a great product, so you can't go wrong. 

I'd also like to commend TJ in Finance for his courteous and professional work. It was getting late in the evening and while covering all bases, he did so in an expedient manner.  This gentleman knows his business! Thanks, TJ!

Thank you, Taylor, Tim, and TJ for your help.  I hope to see you again in three years when this lease is up.

429,"August 24, 2015"," I cannot brag enough about the experience I had at this dealership. I had set out that day to check out and test drive a couple cars, not really dead set on buying something immediately. It was my first time purchasing a vehicle, as my first car was given to me. 

First I went to the Nissan dealership down the road and had a terrible experience. The floor manager couldn't seem to understand that I wanted to look around and try a few cars out since I have only ever driven a truck. He got very rude and offended I wouldn't but his car. So by the time I got to Honda I felt very discouraged and was dreading getting out to walk around because I expected another vulture to come pester me. 

I could not have been more wrong. I was immediately greeted by Chris, who was extremely upbeat and friendly.I wound up test driving the 2015 Honda Civic and fell in love. I didn't think there was any way I could afford a new car as a college student, but man did we try!!! Chris worked so hard to get the payments worked out for me. He was extremely honest and forward about my options giving his personal testimony on leasing and such. Unfortunately, I just couldnt quite make the payments since I really had no wiggle room in my  budget, but they did get extremely close. 

Later that night though Chris messaged me, with options of slightly used cars that he thought we could make work. We kept in touch throughout the week until I could come in again and look. When I came in Saturday morning he kept his promise that I would leave with a car that day. He had the perfect car ready for me when I came in. The exact same as the new one, just a year old and VERY lightly used. I could not be happier! I got an amazing deal. My friend who went somewhere else got the same car but 2 years older, and still has higher payments than I do. 

I dealt a little with Rowdy who was very polite, and TJ helped me back in finance. He was also very friendly and I never felt pressured into something I wasn't comfortable with. 

Everyone I ran in to at this dealership was so nice, and not at all like what you dread when coming in to buy a car. Chris has continued to check on me and make sure I was happy and offer to help if I needed any assistance like with figuring out my Bluetooth set up or anything. This was a perfect first experience buying a car. I would definitely come back and I'll recommend them to anyone I know! ",5.0
430,"August 22, 2015","We have been LOYAL Honda owners for over 30 years.  After moving to the Metoplex, we found a huge variation between dealerships and their ideas of providing value to customers.  Everything from being charged for Lo-Jac as a dealer installed mandatory option to having to negotiate the free factory included floor mats kept us focused on one dealership.  Fortunately that dealership has been taken over by Berkshire Hathaway and that led us to Honda of Burleson.
The people there are tremendously customer focused, politely asking the simple: ""How may I help you?"" and ""What else can we do for you?"" Their knowledge of the vehicles and clear commitment to making the customer happy and committed to returning is exceptional.
Special Kudos to our sales Person, Lisa DeMay, infectious in her cheerfulness, relentless in her pursuit of the vehicle we wanted but was not in their inventory, thoughtful in her follow through and clearly interested in our repeat business and not just this sale.

There are so many things he and the staff did for me that I can't thank them enough for. After shopping around a hand-full of dealerships, walking into Honda of Burleson felt like coming home. It was easy and mostly painless and I was in and out in about 3 hours!

515,"May 06, 2014","I flew to Dallas from Orange County, CA to inspect, purchase (hopefully), and drive home a 2007 Honda CR-V EX with around 38,000 miles on it (an impossible number; should have been my first clue) at one of those small used car dealers with strangely low prices. The dealer, For Less Autohaus, was located in a warehouse in an industrial area east of DFW airport (should have been my second). When I discovered the concealed frame damage, and was yelled at by the dealer in his office for calling him out on it, and told that I could take a taxi home, for all that he cared, I was more than a bit distressed (don't think for a second that y'alls liberal use of state administered lethal injection cocktails didn't figure into my calm demeanor in the reception room as I waited for my photographer friend and his wife to pick me up; see, it works!).

I had now spent $275 of my mother's $12,000 new (to her) car budget, and was faced with the prospect of not only biting another $250 chunk out of it for a short notice return flight home, but of calling her and telling her that the vehicle that she was so excited about was in fact a scam.

Heartbreak.

On the ride back to my friends' home in Highland Village, we searched AutoTrader.com again, and found a 2008 Honda CR-V EX with under 43,000 miles on it at Honda Of Burleson over in... oh yeah, Burleson. It had a clean CarFax, was (maybe of utmost importance) offered for sale by a Honda dealership, and looked super clean.

We called the next day to ask some questions about the condition (had it been smoked in, any blemishes, etc.). Joey answered the phone, and told me about the inside driver door handle being a little beat up. I gave him the short version of my reception in Texas by Dallas' Persian-American independent used car dealer contingency, texted him a photo of the cashiers check made out to For Less Autohaus that I had in my hand as evidence, and asked him to immediately knock $1000 USD off the price of the vehicle in question in order to restore my faith in humanity. Joey asked his manager if he thought that was a good idea. He didn't. Joey told me that internet pricing was not usually negotiable, especially over the phone, but if I were on the property... Who knows?

I had my buddy drive me from Highland Village to Burleson, a journey of just over an hour in Wednesday afternoon traffic. My plan was to surprise Joey, offer him way too little for the car, and before he knew what'd happened to him, I'd be speeding toward California, pumping my fist in the air the whole way. The receptionist was very friendly, and summoned Joey almost immediately.

Joey shook my hand with a smile, and then started to tell a very cruel joke that started with the lines, ""The car's gone. It's sold."" It wasn't that funny, though. I did my best to pretend that I was unaffected by this development, and Joey did his best to pretend that he was sorry about it. He was actually convincing. We shook hands before I left the lot, and as we headed back up the 35W toward home, I actually had sort of come to terms with the fact that I would be flying out tomorrow instead of driving. I didn't feel defeated. I thought to myself, ""It just wasn't God's plan for me to buy a car here."".

I enjoyed my last night in town at LSA Burger Bar in Old Denton. The Chili Willie burger is not likely North Texas' best, but the view over the square was good, and the live entertainment was decent. But it was loud. Ears bleeding loud. So loud, that when my phone was trying to alert me to the incoming 817 area code call, I scarcely noticed. I flashed the phone's screen to show everyone at the table why I was jumping up from the table and walking quickly to the stair (easier than screaming at them over the music), and answered the phone when I was just out of line of sight of the music act's sound system, and just about out of rings. On the other end of the call was Joey Zana.

He got right down to business. The girl who had agreed to buy the car earlier had returned the car for a supposed lack of circulation in her extremities, or something (""cold feet"" I think he called it). The CR-V was up for grabs again, and I was next on the list. I was coy. I told him that I'd need to think about it, and I revisited the idea of negotiating the price downward to reflect the emotional distress that I had endured. He politely declined. I told him that I would need to give it a think, and call him back. I waited a suitable amount of time, and sent him a text message signaling my intention to pick up the car in the morning. 

I showed up to Honda of Burleson late the next morning, and the car was parked in front of the showroom. I walked around the little sport-ute, and immediately noticed more than a couple of previously undisclosed door dings. Joey announced them to me anyway, and let me know that if there were time, he would have the dents removed professionally by the dealership's ""guys"". I told him not to worry, that he could subtract that cost from the price of the vehicle, and when I got the vehicle safely across the California state line, I could have my ""guys"" fix 'er up just as easily.

Let me stop my story to say this, before I forget: I don't know if it was because I'd had such an unpleasant experience at the previous Dallas area dealer that I'd visited, or if it was because of the relief that I was feeling, having found a car. But I remember thinking to myself, and remarking to my wife, that everyone at this dealership was really friendly. Genuinely. There's cordial, professional, and helpful. And then there's genuinely friendly. Every employee in this building who spoke to me fell into the latter camp. Even the people who only uttered one phrase or sentence in passing. Really nice. Really cool. In fact, I was texting Joey, the salesman, 'til 11pm last night. First taking care of business, then cracking jokes.

There was only one guy at the dealership who didn't show me his teeth, or turn the corners of his mouth up when he looked at me. Mike, the finance manager, holds what must be an uncomfortable position in the enterprise. Imagine being the only unfriendly guy in a crowd of happy people. He must feel like everyone else is drinking the Kool Aid, or that he's the only sane one, or the only grown up, or the only realist. It's got to be weird. Anyway, just minimize contact with him if you can, I suppose. When it was explained to Mike that the customer (yours truly) was told that there would likely be no fees other than the sale price, plus vehicle inventory tax, and that customary fees were added anyway, Mike defended those fees like they were his mother's honor. He made no apologies for them, the miscommunication, or the situation, and I think he even strengthened his resolve to keep the corners of his mouth pointed at the floor. After he confronted my new friend Joey about the miscommunication in front of me (more than a little uncomfortable), sales manager Rowdy, sitting next to Mike and overhearing the confrontation, delivered what must have been a demoralizing blow to his frowning colleague. ""Just roll the price back."" Big shock. Another friendly and helpful employee. Poor Mike must get ganged up on a lot like that at his work.

When Joey and I got back to his desk, he apologized for Mike and the situation. He told me that he's a good guy ('cause that's what good guys do), and committed to get me out of the building with my new (to me) car as quickly as he could, as I had my wife and our friends sitting at a table in the showroom for a good while now, sucking down sweet tea and telling stories to each other to pass the time. 

Joey made good on his promise. I rejoined my friends, and the time passed quickly. Every time that he needed a copy of something from me, or a signature somewhere, he came speedwalking around the corner, and disappeared in the same fashion. We had our keys in hand before too long, and we gave him hugs goodbye. And after a very late lunch with our friends, and some drawn out goodbyes, we aimed the car at California and mashed the gas pedal, pumping our fists in the air the whole way. ",4.8

517,"April 22, 2014","This was hands down the best car buying experience I've EVER had, and let me tell you why!  First off, I have been to several dealerships here in the DFW area for 2-3 weeks and kept getting mixed experiences, from the good, down right to the bad.  Finally, after weeks of trying to figure out exactly what I wanted, I finally decided on the exact color, trim and car that I wanted.  The ONLY problem.....was there wasn't a single new one in the DFW area, EXCEPT for Honda of Burleson!  I reached out to Honda of Burleson on Thursday April 17th and got an immediate response from my salesman, Eddie Urbina.  I responded back and asked for some pictures because it said something related to the pictures not being available yet.  Eddie asked for my cell and told me he'd send pictures.  A few minutes later, he informed me that they haven't received the vehicle yet but that it was due to come to the dealership on Saturday April 19th.  I explained my situation to him through text on what I've been dealing with the past few weeks, and he informed me that he could do a deal with me via phone!  That in itself, I was shocked considering I kept getting the ""run around"" from all of these other dealerships in the DFW area (Frisco, Irving, Dallas).

At this point, Eddie informed me that he could send me over a form to get further information on my trade, and that he could get me #'s by a certain time.  That is exactly what he did! He was able to evaluate my trade, and get my exactly where I wanted to be the SAME day.  Let me just tell you, that I have bought 8 cars (this Honda Accord Coupe EX 2014 model in BLUE was my 8th one) and he made it so extremely easy and quick, and basically ALL of the deal was completed through a TEXT MESSAGE! How awesome is that? He made my life so much easier, and I got the car that I wanted.

I literally agreed to the deal the same day, and signed the paperwork with my credit union the next day.  Come Saturday (just 2 days later), he informed me that the vehicle was there, sent me pictures and told me that no one would be in my vehicle except the people to detail it, and that was it!  He kept me up-to-date on ever single process, what was going on, answered any and ALL questions that I had, and was always responsive!  By far, the best salesman I've had in my car buying experience and I would highly HIGHLY highly recommend Eddie to anyone that is needing a new Honda!

In regards to my finance manager, Jerrod Nieman, he was awesome as well!  I literally only had to deal with 2 people at the dealership the day I arrived (keep in mind I live in Irving, TX so I had to drive to Burleson about 45 mins away, but it was totally worth the drive!) -- I get there and Eddie comes straight out and goes to show me my car!  After he shows me everything with my car, he takes me into the office to sign the final paperwork with Jerrod.  Let me tell you, Jerrod was awesome as well!  You know that feeling that you always dread when going into the ""finance office"" to sign the paperwork and you're terrified to deal w/them or hear them try to sell you on different products?  Well with Jerrod, I didn't dread that feeling.  Immediately he made you feel comfortable and at home, and was great at his position!  Everything was quick and easy, great conversation, great display of products and how they work, and got me right in and out with my paperwork and I was finished!

I'm writing this long review for 2 reasons: 1) I don't ever write reviews over my experiences and 2) this was an experience that I feel I should shout out to the world about because it was just awesome, and who can say that for their 8th car buying experience?  Everything was great - and on top of everything, the added bonus of a lifetime/forever warranty on your power train, a great salesman & a great finance office, this experience was and is worth the drive and I will ALWAYS recommend this dealership and team to all of my friends & family!

I have always been somewhat hesitant when it comes to purchasing a new car.  
The moment that I met Lisa Malagisi I was put at ease by her professionalism.  He set me at ease and gave me a sense of trustworthiness.  
She spent several hours working with me on attaining the best possible deal that would fit my needs.  We discussed leases versus buying.  
After much thought, I decided that purchasing would be the right choice and she worked with me to get the best results that I would feel comfortable with.

551,"January 10, 2014","Horrible buying experience. I contacted the dealership to see if they could help me find a certified used odyssey with low mileage. I was promptly contacted back that they had one. We drove two hours, and after specifically asking again if it was certified, we purchased it. The next day I notice the manuals are missing and the keyless entry isn't working so I call to question this and find out that the vehicle was not certified, but that I could drive another 2 hours back to have it done for $800, but that that would void my ""lifetime power train warranty."" I opted to return the vehicle instead, now I'm out time, gas money, and lost time at work. Buyer beware: When I pressed the matter, I was told that they do not certify ANY of their used vehicles. That's the agreement they have with the 3rd party who provides the lifetime warranty. Even though they have cars listed in their inventory as ""certified pre-owned,"" they are not certified, but ""certifiable,"" meaning you can pay an extra $1k to have it inspected. They list a certified price though?  No thanks. They kept trying to explain why their warranty was better, as if that made their deceptive advertising somehow ok. I asked to speak with a manger more than once during this experience and I never did. Only dealt with the two salesmen (Carl and Eddie) and the finance guy (Robert). I was told that since they handled the sale I had to deal directly with them. When I brought the car back, I was left waiting for 2 hrs and found out they had pulled my credit record multiple times after having been asked NOT to do that. Poor poor poor service. Will never darken their doorstep again. There's a reason they are the only Honda dealership that offers the lifetime warranty, because the other dealerships aren't shady enough to pull bait and switch on their customers. ",1.4

I was about to file a restraining order when I decided to complain to someone higher then the area manager of Burleson Honda. Read the fine print because when they sold me the power train warranty they failed to mention that in order to keep the warranty ALL services would have to be done through them and BEFORE recommended time per the Manuel, not during or after BEFORE! They are quick to sell you a product but don't take the time to explain how their policy works. When I went in very disappointed that I had paid for a service (prepaid maint.work) i wasn't receiving, I was told that its my responsibility to inform them that I had prepaid.

Then went to go drive and purchase vehicle and guess what it was sold. My guess is they sold it with bad transmission,and told the customer to make a claim thru their 3rd party lifetime powertrain warranty. Insurance fraud if you ask me. After agreeing to let their body shop take care of damage to cadillac instead of making claim on there insurance, this is how I was treated. Been a week so far waiting on Cadillac, I suspect it will take another week if I'm  lucky. Poor communication between sales people and managers costing me time and money.

Richard is super professional and does not try to over sell and under serve. He was amazing and took care of my friends needs right on and within the budget set. 

What makes Richard even more outstanding is the fact he helped me with a question regarding a sale from another dealership. He went way out of his way and honestly answered my questions and in a manner not to make anyone look bad or himself better simply honest and up front. He went in detail what to expect as a customer with Honda of Burleson.

They are here to help customers in all processes of buying a car and not set to rush how fast they sell a car.

Beware the ""roof to floor, bumper to bumper"" warrenty they offer. You have to sit there until they find the problem, then get it approved to be covered under warrenty, then they will get you a rental car. If you need a car they make you rent one but say you are responsible for paying for it until they find the problem and get it covered under warranty.  I have sat there for 6+ hours and they never offered a loaner car or found the problem. On top of that if they don't find whats wrong then they want you to pay a $90 dollar diagnostic fee. Since purchase (Aug '12) car has been in to the shop for multiple issues. The latest is the ac going out and they haven't been able to find a problem in 2 visits totaling over 10 hours.

560,"March 20, 2013","My journey for a car began in October of last year when my wife and I began to seek to replace her car. When we walked onto the lot, the first person to greet us was Ben Bunte -- we explained what we were looking for and the price range we were hoping to meet. He then took us to the lot and showed us vehicles that were both in the price range and met our expectations. Ultimately, we did not purchase from them at this time and opted for a new vehicle from another dealer. 

Three months later, we decided it was time to replace my 11 year old car with something more reliable and newer. I immediately contacted Ben and explained to him what I was looking for -- a 2011 Chevy HHR for around $12-13k or something comparable. When I showed up on the lot that day he showed me three different vehicles (they didn't have any HHR's at that time) and all three met my requirements -- but I really wanted an HHR. A few days later, they received an HHR. Ben contacted me and I came down and test drove the car. I have a strong aversion to red cars, and this HHR was red so I again decided to wait. 

I began looking around at other dealers to see what was out there. I stopped in at a competitor and test drove one of their cars -- but the car was a very poor quality car listed for around the same price that Honda of Burleson had it listed. After running through the high pressure sales deal, I declined to purchase from this dealer because of the sales tactics used and the very limited, 30 day warranty on the vehicle. Let's face it, the Lifetime Warranty that Honda or Burleson offers is the most compelling reason to purchase a used car from them. 

In the mean time, Ben was working hard for me. He would constantly send me text messages letting me know of vehicles that matched my criteria. Then one day, he texted me to tell me a couple had just come in and traded a Silver HHR. Before the car was even detailed he contacted me and I came in to test drive the vehicle. We then ran the numbers -- this was the first time Ben asked any sales related questions. When he came back with the offer, every number was listed, the price of their car, all fees and the trade in value of my car. There was no guessing at how much tax I was paying, what the cost of TTL would be -- all were fully disclosed allowing me to see exactly how much I was going to need to pay for the vehicle. This is a refreshing change from so many dealers that just list the price of the car and then add that horrible ""+TTL"" to the end of the price.

We worked all of the numbers and had an agreed deal that night. I explained that I needed to run everything by my wife and I would return the following day to complete the paperwork. Rowdy Gibbs came out to make sure I was satisfied with everything about the deal, and I explained that everything looked good. Neither Ben or Rowdy placed any pressure on me to complete the deal right then and there -- no begging to have my wife come in and talk through the deal. The next day, Ben was scheduled to be off spending time with his family so we set a time to come complete the paperwork. 

As the documents were being drawn up, Ben and I shared some great stories about how his grandparents were very instrumental in his development as a musician, where he went to school to study music and where he plays now. He even showed me a picture of his instruments (a double bass, piano and guitar). Let's just say, he's very personable! 

After about 90 minutes, I was in the finance office working with David Tinsley to complete the paperwork and financial part of the deal. He carefully explained everything and provided all of my options. After signing everything, I was driving away from the dealership and pleased with the deal and the process of purchasing.

I was quoted a price on the phone as well as through email, drove an hour to look at this vehicle and found no unwanted surprises.  The only surprise I found was the level of professionalism from my Salesman, which was exemplary.  This was truly the first and only fast as well as pleasant vehicle buying experiance I've ever had.  I would recommend not only this dealership but my salesman very highly to anyone looking to purchase a new Honda vehicle.  Thank you, Rick!",5.0
578,"October 09, 2012",I give this review because my family and I saw the great welcome from the time we walked in till the time we left.  Chris Yates is a great salesman he knows how to get or find the best deal that will work for your budget. He shows his concerns that he care by calling and checking on you he als good at offering refreshments. He showed me my car inside and out and explained everything into detail. He's the best I am happy and enjoying my new ride comfortably. :),5.0
579,"October 07, 2012",Staven politely met us in the parking lot and introduced himself. He  was willing to show us several cars as we were undecided. Our original plan was just to look at cars and think about buying in the future. We liked the size of the CR-V and we thought it was priced good. Staven allowed us a test drive and then we spoke with the manager. Staven let us know up front that we were his first customers.  Staven did not hesitate to get help when needed and we had no problem with him taking extra time in learning the process. We decided to get the CR-V and then spoke with Dean Smith to do the financing. Overall the process went smoothly and we were able to get Staven his first sale! Thanks go out to Staven and to all the others who helped us in this process.,4.8
580,"October 05, 2012","This dealership is only worried about the sale and that is it, there is no customer service after the sale of the vehicle. You would think a salesperson would give a customer a second key to their vehicle at a cost of $160.00 to get a future sale of a vehicle costing at least $25,000.00 in return. It called customer satifaction and they totally missed gaining a customer for life. I would never recommend this dealer to any of my friends and I will never shop there for another car.

581,"October 02, 2012","Honda of Burleson is ***** (5 STAR)!

Where do I begin?  WOW!  I had 5 other Honda dealership respond to an inquiry I had made regarding my interest in the 2012 Honda Civic LX.  Honda Burleson stood out of the 6 dealerships (all of which wanted my business, and all of which seemed very professional).  Out of the 6 dealerships that contacted us, Mike Wassen was the driving force that led us to meet him first (at least) so that is where we started.  From the very moment we stepped into the dealership until the moment we left the dealership we were treated ***** star.  The price negotiation on the new car was seemlessly easy and price negotiation was what my wife and I were well pleased with the price of the new car as agreed.  Then we had the dealership evaluate our trade (which we had maintained in mint condition).  Without going into details of what the trade was, and all that, what must be understood here, is that again, Honda of Burleson gave us a trade value that was what my wife and I felt to be very reasonable.  We sought good advice from our Banker and others in the auto sales profession before we pulled the trigger to start shopping.

We feel that Honda of Burleson is:         ***** (5 star)
Honda's quality of cars is:                ***** (5 star)
Our experience from arrival to departure:  ***** (5 star)
Robert Cassel (finance)                    ***** (5 star)

Michael Wassell (our sales PRO)            ****** (6 star) yes, 6 star.

For those of you reading this review on dealer rater, please know that I am a hard evaluator, meaning that if I have poor service from a waiter or waitress then I don't leave them a tip.  If I have excellent/superb service I leave at least a 30% tip and often a personal note, and sometimes I will speak to a manager.

Michael Wassell will be our salesman by choice when we are back in the market for a new Honda!  He made it all work out great!

She was very knowlegable about the vehicle I selected and she worked with my schedule to meet with me over a couple of days after work.  Angela arranged for my son to test-drive the vehicle and even helped me get beter financing than my credit union offered. The dealership is beautiful.  Everyone I met was was polite and helpful.

588,"August 27, 2012","I went to several Honda dealers before purchasing my Honda Civic from Burleson Honda, I went back to Honda of Burleson because upon my intial visit Victor Bernal was very honest, kind, and did not make me feel pressured or bullied (I experienced this at McDavid Honda in Irving), on that initial visit Victor and I didnt reach a sales agreement but he said he would do some research and try to find the model of car I was wanting, he currently didnt have what I was looking for, he was honest, friendly, and very genuine, this I discovered during my time at other dealerships is a rare and beautiful thing! Establishing a warm, upfront and honest relationship combined with Victor doing exactly what he said he would do, (found the model I wanted and gave me, what I believe to be an extremely fair price) made me WANT to return and purchase a vehicle. Upon purchasing my Civic, Mike Wassell walk me to the car, got in with me and proceeded to show me how the vehicle worked, he linked my phone to my car, showed me how to set up voice recognition, and together we went thru everything the car had to offer and all its functions (there are about a billion, and I am having fun using every one of them!) Mike was exactly like Victor, a gentleman, kind, sincere and answered every question I had with patience and understanding, I have had to return to HOnda of Burleson for further ""schooling"" and Mike has always been available and willing to give me a 100% of his time and attention, he has shown ""Job"" like patience and for that I am extremely grateful! I have also visited the service department and find that kindness, consideration, and respect is a refreshingly contagious ""disease"" that is running rampant throughout the entire dealership :)  Not only is HOnda of Burleson my new dealership for purchase/repairs/addons but I can say they are also my friends!

Needless to say we were very concerned. We called Angela, knowing that we did not have a warranty, just asking if they would tow it in and check it out for us. We did not expect them to do the repairs, just wanted them to find out what the problem was so we would know what we were looking at. Angela and Jennifer both were so kind, they had the car picked up, checked it out and the sales department took care of all the expenses of the complete repairs.  This dealership has so much integrity, they went above and beyond what they are were called to do.

636,"May 28, 2012","On February 1st, 2012, we purchased a pre-owned 2009 Mitsubishi from Fern for cash. It was a great car, a great experience, and Fern was everything we hoped for in a salesman. All of our questions were answered (and we had some good ones!), we were treated with respect, all staff members that we dealt with were helpful and courteous, and the car has met all of our expectations. We bought a certified pre-owned wityh remaining factory warranty plus Honda of Burleson's Lifetime Warranty. I don't expect any unpleasant surprises with this car. We would highly recommend Fern and Honda of Burleson to any and all of our friends.

We have also dealt with the service department on two occasions (routine maintenance and an inspection on another vehicle) and they were one of the most professional service departments we have ever dealt with, far superior to anything else in Johnson County.

We were so pleased that, when another vehicle became available that met my needs, I returned to Fern and bought a second pre-owned vehicle. See my next review.

640,"May 11, 2012","I came in and met with Rick Simpson on March 10th.  I purchased a 2005 Honda Accord.  The car wasn't ready that afternoon, so I came back on the 13th.  Just two days later the car wouldn't start.  I called Rick that morning and he said he would have someone come out.  As the day went on and I hadn't heard back from him I called and he said he was real busy and had a lot of appointments but he could come out after work.  It wasn't until I called Shannon two days later that a tow truck was sent out to get the car.  At that time I asked for a refund and he said no, it doesn't work that way.  I was given a loaner car while they tried to fix my car.  After a week, I called to check the status and Shannon said he was just fixing to call me (his standard response).  When I came to pick up my car, I was told the problem with my car wasn't the car but rather the key so they had a new key cut for the car.  I drove the car for two days and again on the third day, it wouldn't start.  I called Shannon and he sent Rick out and he was visably not happy to be sent out here.  Again my car was kept at the dealership for a week and again I had to initiate contact about the status of the car.  This time I was told the issue was the ignition switch.  I, again, drove the car for two days and again on the third day it wouldn't start.  By now, this unreliable car had cost me time off work and missed doctor appointments.  I called Shannon and he told me they were just I would just going to switch out my car for another comparable car.  Several weeks passed before Shannon called and said he hasn't been able to find me another car.  Finally after close to two months, I was finally going to get a refund. I wouldn't recommend this dealership to anyone.  It seems like most, if not all, of the used cars have come from auctions which doesn't seem to be a good thing.       ",1.6

It was the easiest car buying experience I have ever had.  The drive from Houston was definitely worth it.  Just moments after I pulled into the dealership, I was taken to my car which was personally reserved for me and already had the spoiler installed that I requested.  I was so impressed!  It made me feel like a rock star.  Ben was so kind and genuine - he really has a true passion for customer service.  That alone was the biggest seller for me!  Chris was also such a gentleman and made me feel at ease with not an ounce of pressure.  All pertinent information was explained to me very thoroughly without boring me to tears and taking all day, which was a pleasant surprise from my last car buying experience in Houston eight years ago.

He had been encouraging me to buy Honda and after breakfast together, we came by to see what we could do about purchasing a Honda. I had contacted the internet sales department in advance and met Rick Simpson right away upon arriving at the dealership.  Rick was very helpful and did a GREAT job helping me find the best deal for my needs. My brother had bought a like-new-used Civic and was very satisfied, but after the great experience I had, he wished he had known about internet sales!

My brother was with, as I said before, and he couldn't understand the long wait either as he had not had that experience.  The end result was a very good experience and I am a satisfied customer!  I only wish I had gotten the spoiler! But the increase in monthly payment seemed a little out of order.  The car is GREAT! but in my excitement I didn't notice the vanity mirrors aren't lighted. Driving to work 45 min each way at 5am and 7pm I found that a bonus.  That seems a small thing but on a car with a moonroof I wasn't expecting anything less.

3rd time I called and asked for the sales mgr - Victor called me right back - set a time to meet with me about two particular vehicles - 
When I arrived at the dealership - I was so excited - Victor met me in person - told me he had the cars I had talked with him about and introduced me to Fern a salesman who had such knowledge about the automobiles - built my confidence back in the dealership - which by the way is a truly magnificent facility and incredible experience on its own -- and the start of a car purchase became a wonderful and quick experience.

688,"January 19, 2012","The only way to do justice to what these guys did for us is just to tell you what happened. At 4am on the wednesday before Christmas my wife and I where cruising north on I-35 headed for Kansas City for the Holiday. In the back seat of our older Mercedes sedan slept or two sons. Lost in thought and beginning to feel the weight of my eye lids, I heard a slit noise, low and faint, then Thump, Thump, Thump, loud and getting louder with ever passing second. It was the right rear axle, I recognized the sound from the last time it went out 5 years earlier. Instantly I know our trip was over and just then my wife sat up from here half dozing sleep and said ""What is that?..."" Slowing down I shared my shade tree diagnoses with her, as we both glanced back at our kids sleeping peacefully. At this point I could see nothing on the horizon, no gas stations coming up, no farm road exit to pull off to, nothing... Just wide open Interstate, pitch black and desolate.
I slowed enough to slow the tempo of the thumping and hoped to buy some extra miles, and just then the familiar yellow light of the golden arches appeared in the distance. Yes, we would at least make it there, I thought. Pulling in we let the boys continue to sleep and my wife and I closed or eyes to clear our heads and try and rest for a few hours until they opened. When they did we took the boys in to eat and play, while we plained our next moves. We had a few scenarios, rent a car and continue on, rent a car and go home, have my brother bring his flat bed trailer up and tow it back to Boerne, but in the back of my mind I trusted a voice that said, ""What about trading it in...?"" We had been plaining on buying a van after the first of the year... Why not now? 
 So I went to the manager of McE Dee's and ask about car dealerships, Honda of Burleson had just open a few miles up I-35 she said, so I called and at 8 am on a wednesday morning Don Lawson answered. With in 30 minutes he was sighting in the parking lot of McE Dee's in one of two used Honda Odyssey's they had. As we visited he drove us up the road to the dealership, and after discovering the other van was perfect for us, Don and his team set to work. 
Now these guy's could have easily tried to rack us over the coals, or play ever game you may expect (or what I would have expected if I wasn't in that exact moment), but I'm telling you these guy's cared. Not out of just some sense of wanting to ""Make a Sale"", but a sense of compassion, professionalism, and just down right kindness. This is a Very rare quality in this era, and one I will Never forget. 
We hung out in there first class facilities while our kids played in the playrooms, watched TV, and used there computers. And by mid-afternoon the Very Far deal was struck, and we were the proud owners of a gently used mini van. These guy's saved our bacon, no two way's about. Yes, we could have rented a car or fixed ours, or gone home, but something about this experience really restored a faith in me that had become cynical I suppose.
When I'm old and grey (an even right now) I'll look back and remember with a fond, Thankful, glad heart. Thank You Honda of Burleson, Don Lawson, your management team and anyone I might be forgetting, you saved our Holiday, and much, much, more.

I was previously informed that the towing package would need to include coolant provisions for the transmission in order to maintain the warranty.  Jeremy was unsure of this necessity, as he appeared especially knowledgeable about this subject, but he intended to follow up our conversation with the answer and a price for the installation.  That afternoon Jeremy called me again and verified my facts about the towing package, and though he was not able to absorb the total cost of the installation into my offered price, he was able to provide a very competitive total price for the vehicle plus the towing package.  The next day when I needed to continue to discuss aspects of the vehicle, Jeremy handled my phone calls, even on his day off (i.e., out of the office).  I also received assistance from Richard Valdes, who upon request provided me additional details concerning the vehicle as well as some photos by email.  The photos really helped my family feel comfortable about the grey interior, since it was not our first choice.  Jeremy was always respectful, friendly, and informative and let the positive aspects of the vehicle convince me to make the purchase without being obnoxious or manipulative.  On 1/7/12 my family drove from Waco to Burleson to view the car and make a decision whether or not to buy it.  Jeremy honored the price he had previously quoted me and helped to make the buying process easy and understandable and the dealership was extremely family-friendly.  In addition, we were provided all the details concerning the financing and the various warranties covering the vehicle and also decided to purchase an extended warranty.  The following week, Jeremy kept me informed of the towing package installation status and met my family in Hillsboro with the vehicle on Wednesday.  On 1/16/12 I was personally contacted by my financing agent that had worked with me at Burleson to inform me of a mistake in the paperwork.  Even though this correction would lower my interest rate and potentially result in less money for Honda, the agent demonstrated his integrity and desire to provide honest service.  I still feel that most Honda vehicles are overpriced; however, I am optimistic that I received a fair deal and that I will be pleasantly surprised with the long-term performance of the car.  I feel that Jeremy and his supporting staff provided fantastic service, and if I buy another Honda, I will look no further than Honda of Burleson.",4.8
690,"January 16, 2012","I was in an accident the week before Christmas, and my car was totaled. Noone was hurt, but the timing was terrible!  I wanted a 2011 because of the reduced prices and interest rates.  However, every lot I visited only had a few left. I test-drove 5 different makes of small SUVs and decided I liked the Honda CR-V best. I then went to 3 Honda dealerships before deciding to purchase at Honda of Burleson. There were only two 2011 CR-Vs on the lot. They weren't exactly what I had in mind, so Jeremy Clark went above and beyond to get a car from another dealership that I would be happy with. (It took several days of negotiating to secure the car.) Then, when I wasn't able to come and get the car, he brought it to me at my place of employment. All done with good humor and a smile! Chris Wilson was also very helpful with the financing, explaining the various warrenties, and putting together a package that suited my needs. The life-time warrenty exclusive to your dealership was also a plus. The whole experience was very pleasant and satisfying.....I will recommend your dealership and these two particular employees to all my friends and colleagues!",5.0

The evening before the day we were suppose to pick up the vehicle my husband took the trade-in to the dealership so that they could finish the transaction the next day. Please let me note the only reason they did not finish the transaction that evening was because my daughter had to study for her college exams and could not make it that evening to sign the paperwork.

My husband left the trade-in and keys at the dealership only to be called the next afternoon while on the road headed to the dealership to be told that the vehicle he thought he was about to buy was sold by another store manager. Where is the communication in this dealership? What kind of dealership is this??? Who makes a deal, takes the trade-in and then sells the vehicle that you thought had your name on it. Honda of Burleson that's who!!! This dealership didn't even make a good attempt to rectify their error. So instead we bought our Honda at Bankston Ford.

720,"September 09, 2011","I found a 2007 Honda Fit advertised on the Honda of Burleson (TX) Website at a great price. The fact that the Fit was a Certified Pre-Owned Vehicle made for a quick phone call. Unfortunately, I never received a call back from the salesman who promised he would get back to me when the car was ready to be shown. A week later I called the dealership again. With good fortune I made contact with Don Lawson in their used car sales department. From that point on the process went as smooth as butter. I drove up from the Austin area to meet with Don to check out a Certified Pre-Owned, 2008 Honda Fit (the 2007 had been sold). I found the car to be in excellent shape apart from a couple of minor dings which Don promised to fix. Back to Austin I went to sell my car. Two weeks later I hopped the AMTRAK train to Ft. Worth. Upon my arrival the Honda of Burleson courtesy van was standing by to take me to the dealership. Thanks, Don, that was much appreciated.
Were the dings fixed? No, apparently staff turnover in their body shop prevented that, but Don promised the dings would be fixed if I could make a return trip. He even offered a loaner car when doing so. My only other reservation about my experience has to do with the finance package. I know there are many options when it comes to finance rates for auto purchases. At the close-out with the accounting rep., what Honda of Burleson was prepared to offer me came with no mention of other rate options. 
With a beautifully appointed, spanking new dealership, it’s obvious Honda of Burleson is out to make the car buying experience as pleasant as possible. I give these friendly folks a thumbs up.

  Don Lawson delivered on all accounts. He got the car we wanted, within the timeframe we had and very close to the budgeted amount we had to work with. On top of that, he was very professional and at the same time so kind and thoughtful.
When I came to pick the car up, he went over the whole car with me to ensure I knew everything I needed to know about the car.
  Also, since my husband couldn't be there to sign the papers, the finance dept. next day aired them to my husband and everything went off without a hitch.
  The only little problem, was the pinstriping. It was not trimmed between the door and the fender. Very minor detail. We brought it back to the dealership and it was taken care of immediately.

729,"August 18, 2011","Buy a car...or get a root canal? Usually I would choose the root canal! However my experience with Honda of Burleson has changed that choice.
I had to make an unplanned car purchase quickly and since my previous car was a well-loved Honda, I was happy to see Honda of Burleson arrive in my city. I went in on the Saturday of their grand opening- not the best time to discuss a deal as a band made conversation almost impossible. I spoke to a gentleman who was not a permanent employee, but was helping out due to the grand opening. Since I had gone online and found a Honda Certified pre-owned car that I liked, I negotiated a price without the silly, non-sensical games most dealers love to play. VERY surprising!
When I returned Monday to finalize my deal, I dealt with Ben, a delightful talented classical musician who also happens to be a great salesperson! We wrapped everything up, but then I faced the dreaded ""finance"" office. The last time I purchased my Honda, I was held ""hostage"" for 3 hours in the finance office as he tried to coerce me to buy every warranty, insurance and whatever known to man.
I am happy to say that Tony in finance made me a believer in Honda of Burleson as well. 
He was personable, fun, professional and quick! No hassles, no pressuring.

We were greeted by friendly, and courteous employees every time we drove onto the dealership lot, regardless if it was quiting time. Each employee we spoke with was very knowledgable about the Honda Product(s) and the dealership for which they are working. Honda of Burleson advertises that they offer a ""Dealership experience worth talking about"" and they do. Our New Vehicle Saleman, Don Lawson, (as well as Daniel Collins who filled in for Don in his absence)worked for us as opposed to just trying to sell us a car we didn't need, want or couldn't afford. As a matter of fact, we were very specific with what vehicle we wanted. They did not have that vehicle on the lot, however, they found one, and had it brought to Burleson the next day. Don has, and continues, to go beyond just selling us a vehicle. He continues to follow up with us, making sure we are fully satisfied. And he continues to answer our many questions about our new Honda Pilot. He doesn't pass us along to the service guy or some other person, he takes time out of his schedule, finds our answer and gets back to us in a timely manner. Dean Smith spent much time with us after hours on our first visit, sharing his knowledge of the Pilot as well as giving us a personal tour of the dealership, explaining along the way Honda of Burleson's philopshy and customer service practices. When it came time to finance, Chris Wilson was informative in all of our options. He was helpful in helping us select the right warranty/insurance package to meet our needs. Again, never making us feel that he was in a hurry to leave (as it was after hours once again) or that he was trying to sell us lots of ""extras"" that we did not need or want. 

We are very satisfied with our Honda Pilot, our salesman and sales team, and with Honda of Burleson. We not only did business with them, we have formed relationships with each of them.
