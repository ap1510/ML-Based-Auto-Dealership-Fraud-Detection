0,"December 07, 2019",Traded in my vehicle at the Bayer Ford dealership for a vehicle they had listed on their website. Brian Weaver was my salesmen and made my experience very smooth and enjoyable! I will be back to service my vehicle and for future purchases. ,5.0

2,"April 27, 2019","We bought a car from Bayer and we will go back to Bayer every time we need an auto. We had a discount program through my employer which had a time limit. Bayer and especially Chas Bayer did an amazing job of getting the paperwork finished and our purchase completed. We brought the car in for servicing and Chas noticed the tires weren’t performing to his standards and replaced them. We didn’t even have to ask. Great, honest person who works hard to take care of his customers. Best car buying experience out there.

3,"June 01, 2011","I am the 67 year old mother of Drdaddy and I lived this bullying given out by Chas Bayer all because I did not buy a vehicle from him.  He told me how I had betrayed my community even though he had a ford saleman on staff who had been told twice I was going to buy a new car and nobody even gave me a courtesy call.  He then continued to lecture me for 10 more minutes and then at the end he made the following comment as I recall, ""if you aren't going to trust us to sell you a car, then you had better just not trust our service department.""  I took that as a slight of hand threat if I tried to bring my new little Fiesta in for service which he is bound to do.  I have been encouraged by others in my city to write the Ford Motor Corporation concerning the bullying of the elderly which as soon as I can get the addresses I plan on doing.  I have never bought a car from any other town and was racing a clock for special financing when they never even contacted me.  My son was trying to buy it from Georgia as I am not car buying sauvey and when he called to react to Mr. Bayer's bullying of his Mom, he was also threatened by him to move it to the street to settle it.  What happen to a simple,""gee, we wish we could have had your business but we dropped the ball this time, but next time don't fail to use our service if we treat you right.  I will never go back to this dealership as long as this ""man"" is in charge since he would bully a senior citizen and other people in my community best be warned.",1.0
4,"June 01, 2011","Recently attempted to purchase a car with my mom, a longtime Comanche resident, though I live several states away. When she first approached the Bayer salesman through a mutual friend in my absence, she was told they would happily get her in a new Fiesta at about $4000 OVER sticker. 

After talking with me, my mom really wanted to buy local so we ended up giving Bayer one more chance, but we needed to buy that weekend, and the salesman did not return our phone call asking to match several other much more reasonable prices from other dealers. So, we ended up purchasing from a reputable dealer the next day in a nearby city. 

This is when the story gets even worse. When the owner of Bayer Auto, Chas Bayer, found out my mother had purchased somewhere else, he verbally abused her and warned her that she better not ever bring her new car in for service at his dealership since she did not buy from him and trust him enough to sell her a car. 

She called me in tears. When I called Chas Bayer to confront him over the way he treated my mother, it quickly degenerated into a shouting match, and he actually challenged me to come down and fight him. You cannot make this stuff up. Stay away. You have been warned. ",1.0
