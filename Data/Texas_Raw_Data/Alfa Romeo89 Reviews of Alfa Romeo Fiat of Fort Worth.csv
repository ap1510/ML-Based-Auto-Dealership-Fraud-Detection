0,"June 18, 2020","TONY CANALES (SOME TYPE OF MANAGER) CALLED ME AND JUMPED ME FROM WRITING THIS REVIEW. DIDNT CALL TO FIX IT, JUST TELL ME HOW THEY WERE RIGHT! 

WORST EXPERIENCE AND SERVICE I HAVE EVER KNOWN! THEY HIT MY CREDIT 4 TIMES AFTER I LEFT THE DEALERSHIP WITH A 792 Credit Score! WE LEFT WITH A PLATINUM ESCALADE THAT WE FOUND OUT AFTER WE GOT TO ARKANSAS THE OIL HADN'T BEEN CHANGED AND THE WINDSHIELD WIPER FLUID WAS EMPTY. THERE WAS AN OLD SERPENTINE BELT THAT WAS HANGING DOWN UNDERNEATH THE CAR, BUT WE WERE CHARGED FOR AN INSPECTION!! THEY CHARGED US $2500 FOR A WARRANTY THEY SAID WOULD ONLY COST US $892. EVERY TIME WE CALLED BACK AFTER THE PURCHASE THEY TRANSFERRED US TO A VOICEMAIL, OR PLAYED RAP MUSIC IN THE PHONE AND HUNG UP, OR PICKED UP AND HUNG UP. THIS COMPANY WOULD NOT COMPENSATE US FOR ANY OF THE ISSUES WE INCURRED! WE ARE SCARED TO DEATH SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN TO OUR CAR, BECAUSE OD HOW SHADY THIS COMPANY IS AS A WHOLE! THEY SUBMITTED ALL INFORMATION (REGISTRATION, THE LENDER, AND MY NAME IN THEIR SYSTEM IS WRONG) THEY COULDN’T EVEN FIND THAT I BOUGHT A CAR FROM THEM WHEN I CALLED.",1.0
1,"June 17, 2020","BEWARE!  As you can tell from the poor ratings online, this dealership should be avoided.  Unfortunately, they have a bit of a monopoly in DFW as the next closest major Alfa dealership is several hours away. There is a dealer in Hurst, but their selection is limited. Primarily a Maserati dealer I think.  If you must have an Alfa (as was or case), and Hurst doesn't have your model, it's worth the drive to Houston/Austin to avoid these guys.

A long story but I'll be as brief as possible. We're 2nd time Alfa leasees. We had a bad experience with the Dallas dealership which was shut down by the state due to fraudulent activity (see Kamkad Alfa). That left us with FTW as our closest dealer at over an hour away. We were hesitant about going with Alfa again, especially a dealer so far away, but the car is great, and after multiple talks with FTW we felt comfortable that we were dealing with a reputable dealer.  

We were VERY clear from day 1 about the car we wanted and they had only 1 car that fit.  We negotiated all details and even had a follow up call to review before making the trek to FTW. Upon arrival we quickly realized we had been lied to. At first we were told the car was ready to go and paperwork would be ready shortly.  Just sign and drive away!  After about 30 minutes our salesman came out with a bunch of numbers jotted down on a sheet and a lot of excuses about why they weren't what he promised.  Payments were almost double.  And that was with $ down.  We were told 
Zero down with our lease return.  We asked to speak with a manager.  The manager apologized and said our salesman was new and shouldn't have lied to us.  He was supposedly given a severe reprimand and sent home for the day.  He proceeded to convince us to consider other cars or let him talk to finance to see what they could do on the car we wanted.  We were not in the mood to deal with them at this point and asked them to return our car so we could leave and perhaps consider coming back another day.  After about another 30-40 minutes, (lost our keys?) our original salesman comes back from his smoke break, cigs in hand and seemingly unaffected after his reprimand.  Much to our surprise he wasn't sent home, but he magically found another car that had everything we wanted, minus a moon roof, at close to the price originally quoted.  We wanted the moon roof, but agreed to take a look. It was not remotely the same car.  It was a base model, lacking almost every option we asked for.  The salesman literally sat in the car and argued that it was the exact same car. We again demanded our keys, finally got them, and left.  

I called to speak to someone in management on our way home and vented.  A few days later we were contacted by Preston Wheeler. He apologized for everything again. We reiterated we were still interested in the car, just be honest and tell us what it's actually going to cost. After multiple conversations and texts confirming details we came to an agreement and were again headed to FTW. We met Preston and reconfirmed details. We sat down with Finance (can't recall his name but he was great) and everything was in order. We signed, made our down payment and we were done!  More $ than originally agreed to, but we were happy.  

A week later, we’re contacted by Ally Bank saying we owe another $1000 for a missing key, hail damage, and new tires. The key situation was straightened out but we still owe over $700 for the other items. The hail damage is a lie.  The car was immaculate.  2 years old, 8000 miles, highly desirable option package with hard to find color combo. There were literally 2 pin xxxxx size dings on the entire car. You had to search hard to even see them. The front tires DID need replacing. There was an alignment issue the FTW service department never figured out after 3 trips to inspect.  Both of these items are irrelevant as we were assured during negotiations, and again after our lease return was inspected by FTW Alfa, that any additional costs would not fall to us. We owed a down payment and last month's lease payment, period. 

Since signing papers, Preston has become more difficult to reach. He initially tried to blame Ally, saying they have final say on damage/repairs/inspection on lease returns.  This is sort of accurate, except we confirmed with two people at Ally that they merely receive an inspection report from the dealership’s people, so this is definitely FTW Alfa driven. The car was immediately shipped to auction so no way to prove damage now. And again, irrelevant as we were told our responsibility for that car was done.  

Anyhow, that's our story. We've been leasing/buying cars for 30 years and shouldn't have been so naive. I didn't think a high end dealership would still utilize these tactics in this day and age, but live and learn. If you have no choice but to deal with these guys, don’t be conned into taking them at their word. Get every last detail documented before you sign!",1.0
2,"June 06, 2020","This car dealership is the worse place to purchase a vehicle car.  Stay away from this dealership, as the customer service is absolutely horrible!  I purchased my Alfa Romeo Guilia in October 2018 from this dealership, which was one of the worse buying experiences of my life!  I had a terrible experience today (6/6/2020) while attempting to purchase a a new car.  Total games and a waste of my time!!",1.0
3,"April 13, 2020","I was looking for a pre owned suv over a two month period.  This is during the Corona virus pandemic and all of my browsing was on line.  I found a vehicle I liked and set up appointment with Cole at the Ft Worth location.   The vehicle was clean and sanitized and I felt comfortable driving the vehicle.  They followed all social distancing guidelines and were very respectful of my space.   Cole was very helpful and professional and answered all my questions.  No high pressure, sale was fast and easy and I appreciated being treated fairly. Will definitely look up Cole and the dealership next time I purchase my next car.",4.6
4,"January 14, 2020","I purchased a 2016 Range Rover from your dealership. My salesman was Chase Tennyson, and he was excellent throughout the process. I found him to be knowledgeable, courteous, but most important ""honest""   There were a few items that the dealership promised subsequent to my leaving the dealership with my new vehicle. Mr Tennyson tracked these items daily and provided me with status updates to ensure I was up to speed on the latest. Although Mr. Tennyson has only been with the dealership for a short period, he will undoubtedly continue to be a valued e.ployee!",5.0

6,"September 15, 2019","Una mala experiencia que no olvidare jamas,compramos un auto,pagamos 2000 down,pero faltaba la inspeccion del vehiculo y ya era muy tarde,cuando  regresamos al dia siguiente nos dijeron que habia un inconveniente  del banco,querian 6000 down,les dijimos que asi no habria negocio ,les pedimos los 2000 que habiamos pagado y lo regresaron a la tarjeta,nos pidieron un cocomprador ,estuvimos todo el dia esperando que mi amigo llegara ,desde Dallas,ciudad de donde somos todos,luego le cobraron a mi esposa nuevamente 2000 down porque mi amigo fue aceptado pero cuando nos dieron los papeles a firmar querian poner a mi amigo como comprador y mi esposa como cocompradora ,nos dijeron que en el estado de texas ambos son iguales,entonces les dije si son iguales ponga a mi esposa como compradora y mi amigo como cocomprador y no aceptaron,luego me pidieron 4000 dolares down para poner a mi esposa como compradora,les dije que no ,es un auto de 20000,es mas de un 10 por ciento ,mi esposa con credito de 710 pero primera compradora entiendo ,pero eso es un abuso,les pedi que me regresaran mis 2000 nuevamente a la tarjeta,cuando mi esposa reviso la cuenta del banco no teniamos ni los 2000 anteriores ni los 2000 ultimos,eso fue un jueves y hoy sábado todavia estamos esperando que los 4000 regresen a la cuenta.Revisen bien los documentos que firman,,no confien en ellos,tal vez pensaron que como somos hispanos caeriamos en su trampa,nosotros nos somos de aqui ,pero estudiamos no somos estupidos,no se dejen llevar porque les gustes un auto y estas personas se aprovechen de esto,,ah ya he comprado 2 autos en otros dealers y nunca habia visto esto,solo tengan cuidado!

A bad experience that I will never forget, we bought a car, we paid 2000 down, but the vehicle inspection was missing and it was already too late, when we returned the next day they told us that there was a problem with the bank, they wanted 6000 down, we told them that  there would be no business, we asked for the 2000 that we had paid and they returned it to the card, they asked us for a co-buyer, we were waiting all day for my friend to arrive, from Dallas, city of where we are all, then they charged my wife again 2000  down because my friend was accepted but when they gave us the papers to sign they wanted to put my friend as a buyer and my wife as a co-buyer, they told us that in the state of texas they are both the same, so I told them if they are the same put my wife as  buyer and my friend as a co-buyer and they didn't accept, then they asked me 4000 dollars down to put my wife as a buyer, I told them no, it's a 20,000 car, it's more than 10 percent, my wife with credit  710 but first buyer I understand, but that is an abuse, I asked them to return my 2000 back to the card, when my wife checked the bank account we had neither the previous 2000 nor the last 2000, that was a Thursday and today Saturday  We are still waiting for the 4000 to return to the account. Review the documents they sign, , do not trust them, maybe they thought that as we are Hispanic we would fall into their trap, we are from here,  but we study we are not stupid, do not get carried away because you like a car and these people take advantage of this, , ah I have already bought 2 cars in other dealers and I had never seen this, , just be careful!",1.0

I drove 3 hours to see a specific used vehicle only to get there and be told they sent the vehicle to auction that morning. Seriously? Not only was my sales person “busy” when I arrived for our confirmed appointment, the vehicle we had been discussing for several days is gone.

25,"November 14, 2018","This dealership sold me a car with a bad transmission and catalytic converter!!!
I had it for only a week before the check engine light came on and I found out. Now, I know that buying a used car with more than 100k miles on it means that the upkeep is going to be more necessary.... I am young and typically buy cars with more miles on it. The first red flag though, was when I had ALREADY signed all the paperwork and suddenly the sales and management team wouldn't allow me to drive it off the lot because an unknown part was being ordered. I asked service, management, and sales team members what part it was and no one would tell me. If this happens to you, don't take it home. I thought since I had already signed all the paperwork that everything is set in stone but I found out after everything turned out to be a scam that I didn't have to take it if they refuse to tell me what is wrong with the car even if I signed the contract. 

I was asked to come in so they could ""make it right"" and ""fix me up"" to be told that if I wanted to stay in my budget I needed to buy a fiat............
Then I was told that the $4,500 that I put down on the car a week before the car had ""sudden"" issues would not be applied with the trade in, and not only that... but NONE of the $4,500 I gave them for the down payment on a car that had a bad transmission (One of the most important parts of a car) would not be applied to the trade in. They also lied to me about the carfax (I was only shown 2 pages of it... make sure to check it ON YOUR OWN) and the inspection rights I was told while the deal was being made 
were not in my legal rights. So I suggest you take pictures of everything they show you and make you sign so that they cannot turn around and show you something different after the deal is made. 

Above all, I asked to speak to the owner and he was no where to be found. Then the one sent to talk to me was a manager who blamed me because I bought a car that turned up having issues after JUST A WEEK. They finally showed me everything and it turns out 700 miles were put on the car between the last emissions test and the day they sold it to me (700 miles in only 2 days). Even though I had asked them to do a full test on it before I even came in the day I made the deal!

If you want to waste your money and be lied to during a 5+ hour car buying experience, and then be treated like a fool and bullied after signing paperwork that binds you to that car, then you should certainly go to Alfa Romeo Fiat of Fort Worth.",1.0

36,"June 21, 2018","Spent 6hrs at the dealership only to be shown cars i did not want and be told i could not afford the car without them making any sort of offer to me. For 5hrs they showed me used cars, and after repeating myself many a times that i did not want a used car, the went and showed me another used car. Proceeded to then lose my license and almost refuse to even give me money so that i could get it replaced. Worst experience I've ever had with any dealership, will never be here again, not even to service the vehicle. Will be going to the Alfa/Maserati dealership instead. With FIAT being pulled from the US and Alfa's no longer being in FIAT dealerships, i am hopeful that this place closes down. I'd rather be in a prison camp in North Korea for the next 100yrs than recommend this dealership to anyone.",1.4

I got several calls after I made the appointment from a salesman, I was supposed to be able to go direct to the Finance manager. They took my keys, I tried to get my car back but the pushy salesman wouldn't let me have them he had a reason for everything, called my husband to come over and we were there until almost 11 PM from 5 PM. this is why I hate car shopping! I do not like the FIAT we ended up with, they kept saying about the ""bells and whistles"" I traded in a TOP OF THE LINE lincoln MKX nowhere near what I had!! I was supposed to get the second FOB in the mail, along with the manual neither have arrived, have called several times with no resolution. we were pre-approved but yet they hard hit out credit 4 times. WTH! Never again! NEVER Again and I have to go here for my maintenance? This is so far away and I truly do not want to deal with them ever again. I ordered leather seats cost $1000 someone should call me back! Not to mention I want to change the color, didn't notice on the back there were two scratches, my daughter noticed! NO one called they did the pressure sale, or as I like to say the ""bait and switch"" and now no one will call. I have a FOB for our old car to give them. Would love to get rid of this car so I don't have to deal with them every time I get in it reminds me of the HORRIBLE experience (I don't care how nice they were) it was HORRIBLE word of advice - let someone go home when they say they want their car back so they can go home!

51,"December 11, 2017","My sales rep, Hakim and the sales manager, Joel were both very good to work with to make sure I was getting the best deal possible on the Fiat 124 Spider Abarth. I was from out of state, visiting family in the area and had seen on their website that they had among the best prices I had found for the vehicle that I have been looking for, so I went into the dealership. Hakim and Joel worked with me to get the price I felt was fair and they arranged to ship the car to my home at no additional charge. They also explored every possible rebate option that I qualified to receive, further reducing the cost of the car. The car didn't ship for about 10 days, which was disappointing since I was anxious to drive my new car while the weather was still good, but it took some time to find a driver coming my direction. When the car arrived, there was only one key fob. When I called Hakim and Joel about it they were surprised and searched the parts department, locating the second key fob and sent it to me via FedEx. Eric in finance was good at explaining my options but was accepting of my decision not to purchase any of the additional services or products. A person from the office (I believe her name is Anna) contacted me regarding the car registration form for my state, saying it had a strike through and she was afraid the DMV might have an issue with it, so she sent a new form via FedEx for me to sign and take into my local DMV. When I went to the dealership, I didn't intend to buy the car, because I wasn't in a position to drive it back to my home state, but I wanted to see if the internet price was legitimate. Hakim and Joel were willing to do whatever they could to make it worth my while to buy from them rather than from the dealer in my home state or the neighboring state where I bought my Fiat 500. I'm glad I went into the dealership that day. I have identified some problems, but if I had lived in the area and driven the car off the lot, those problems wouldn't have been an issue. Give this dealership a chance to earn your business, I believe you will be as happy with that decision as I am",5.0

I purchased a beautiful Alfa Romeo Stelvio and Justin was extremely knowledgeable and helpful throughout the process.

They were all professional, friendly and pressure-free.",5.0

Needing to negotiate over the phone while my college student test drove and picked out a used vehicle for college, Justin’s help was awesome.  He helped my daughter pick out a reliable, fashionable, safe car within budget and with little hassle. He treated my daughter with the utmost respect and care. She was in great hands while I was across the country.  And we got a great deal!  Thank you Justin!",5.0

I was luckily paired with Justin Tidwell. Having never bought a car before, I was nervous to walk into a dealership. Justin made the whole experience relaxing and comfortable. I felt confident in his opinions in the cars I was looking at. He helped me find my perfect car, free of pressure and full of confidence!

56,"November 28, 2017","Went to dealership on a Saturday night and test drove 2 vehicles, and told salesman we would call him  on Monday after decision was made. I text the salesman first thing Monday morning to let him know the one we chose and would fill out credit app when he got back to me. Salesman got back to me and told me everything was good. We spoke and discussed the vehicle for the most part of the day, they even ran my credit report and created a hard inquiry on my credit report. They said they already pushed my info to the banks, then told me they didn't, then told me they did. I get to the dealership and wait for close to an hour on my sales person to even sit with me instead of him passing me off, but I understand the business so I brushed it aside. As I was waiting I noticed they had the same make and model vehicle out front but it wasn't the one we chose. The one out front had less features. My spouse then arrives from cheer practice with my daughter in which she left early to make it to dealership coming all the way from Southlake. Salesman hands us paper to fill out and as I'm filling out he says car is ready out front. I told him they pulled the wrong car, he goes back outside confused then goes to GM desk. A mgr came out and told me they sold the car yesterday, as in Sunday lol. We replied, ""I thought y'all closed on Sunday?"". Then he replied, ""I meant Saturday night"". This was comical because we stayed past close on Saturday night and car was still there. I feel they tried to slip us in another vehicle under our noses. Either our salesman held the wrong car which means he doesn't have a good memory, or they sold the car the day I was filling everything out which would have been fine had they told me before having me go up there and having a totally different car ready. Having worked in multiple dealerships, there are ones you go to and they keep it real to earn your business; even telling you that they can't help you.....then there are these guys who give a bad name to the business. I should have had an idea of the business during our 1st visit where there was a customer who had already purchased a vehicle complaining that nobody would help her, guess that how they treat you once they got your money.  Buyers beware!",1.8

They will run your credit 4 to 7 times with different banks. They lie so much. I was sick of it I took the car back. Had to call the police to get my money back. I paid to tint the windows they didn’t want to give me my money nor a copy of the paperwork so now I have to take them to court. Don’t buy from them!

I would like to recognize two of the finest and professional sales employees: Justin and Joel, who
are an asset to the Alfa Romeo Fiat organization and it warrants recognition.These two gentlemen were very informative and knowledgeable and pursued the sale non-stop until it was consummated. Justin and Joel deserve recognition for their efforts that made my- buying experience absolutely wonderful.I am a 74 years old and purchased many cars in my lifetime and never experienced true professionalism as I did at Alfa Romeo Fiat of Fort Worth with Justin and Joel.

62,"November 06, 2017","We were told when we looked at car that they would “definitely be able to take care of the current damage to the car (dents)”. Haggling was obnoxious and involved four different people for over three hours with two crying babies in tow. We were able to agree on a price for the car and as we were beginning the paperwork we were told that “they were not going to repair the dents because they came down on the price”. We are very happy with the Pre-owned vehicle at the price we got it for but not happy with the customer service that we experienced with the managing staff. Katie-sales rep and Chanel-finance, were pleasant to work with. I understand sales but they played dirty games here and we would likely not recommend this dealership to family and friends because of our experience.  ",2.6
63,"October 25, 2017","5 days. Still waiting. Still no license. Tony seems to have refused it's return. Some sort of personal vendetta. He has held my property. Theft is a bit of a stretch... but then again... he refuses to return it.

He called me on the phone and said to say what I am saying here to his face. He has my address. Still waiting.

He will do whatever is needed to keep a person on property until a vehicle is sold, including holding personal items such as car keys for 2 hours as well as your drivers license.

79,"July 23, 2017","This is an in depth review of my experience trying to get a simple price quote from the Ewing Alfa Romeo dealership in Forth Worth, TX

I emailed this dealership inquiring about the new Alfa Romeo Giulia Ti sedan. I received a response from Paul Garrett (Sales Manager) with a lease quote - correct VIN but was quoted for base model for 39 months and 10K miles (I had asked for 24/36 months and 15K miles). Next day I received an email from Joel Martinez (Assistant Sales Manager) asking for some more information so I could get accurate numbers for my lease quote based on the miles/months I had asked for. Same day I also receive an email from Myra Lopez (Internet Sales Manager) who asked me for more information (if I am a USAA member or had any competing car) so that I can get the best possible deal. By the afternoon I get a quote from Myra Lopez for the same 39 months but this time for 15K miles. So I have now dealt with 3 people, and gotten no accurate information. I ask to give me numbers for 24 and 36 months and want a clarification on the Money Factor and residual (since they are way off from what other dealerships quoted me - all Alfa Romeo dealerships in Dallas, TX quoted me based on rates from ALLY bank so residuals and Money Factor should be same, plus they also give tax credits to the dealership, which I wanted to know more about). This is when Myra Lopez tells me that the Selling Price of the car is incorrect and asks me about who quoted me those numbers. She tells me that her manager Joel will clarify. After attaching the quote (that THEY sent me), I get an email back from Joel asking me the same question about who send me the quote. Common guys - Do you want to sell a car or not? After that there is radio silence and now it has been 3 days and no response. 
If this is how they treat potential new customers, I can only imagine the after sales and service will be. Big mistake even considering this dealership. I will be writing to Alfa Romeo corporate to express my frustration.

82,"June 03, 2017","I was unsure of what 2nd car to purchase for our family. I don't like the process of buying a car. When my wife and I arrived at the dealership, the place looked to be in transition. A nice salesman, Cody, greeted us promptly. He was very calm in his demeanor. He and the rest of the team were warm and not pushy. The car we selected sold itself. Cody and the team did not get in the way of that. They were clear communicators the whole time.

83,"May 17, 2017","On Saturday, May 13, 2017 I purchased a Fiat 500x. When I arrived I was greeted by Brandon Sasso. He proceeded to tell me about how he would be getting my windows tinted by someone else because they don't provide that service at the dealership. He said he would get me the contact information before I left. Approximately 8:30 pm I asked him for the information he change his story and said I will call you Monday. Monday came and went. I called Tuesday, May 16, 2017 at 9:17 and spoke with the finance manager Michael Crosley. After signing my contract on Saturday evening he expressed to me that if I needed anything to call him. I did. His response was I will call you back later (May 16th). Since he did not call me back I called at 4:00 pm. and he was gone for the day. So I asked to speak to Brandon he unfortunately was out to lunch. REALLY! Well the receptionist assured me he would call me back he didn't. Oh did I forget to mention they could not locate my second key to my new care. I was told in writing I would receive it via Fed Ex. As of today I have not.

Be wary of the typical car dealership games where the floor manager and finance manager tell you something completely different than the sales associate",1.2
88,"January 28, 2017","I was very disappointed with my experience at this dealership.  I located the vehicle through USAA car buying service .  I called in advance and asked for a guaranteed total which included tax, tag and title, and any other dealer fees. I explained that I had previously had a very negative experience with dishonest care salesman and wanted this to be better.  I did not want to play games. The salesman gave me a price that was acceptable to me. I explained that I had a 2.15 hr drive to the dealership and I was ready to buy for the agreed price.  He also told me he could get me a loan in the 1s as my bank was offering 2.25 for 48 months.  When we arrived, we asked the salesman (William) to show us the finance docs, so we could see everything on paper.  He told us that the finance guy (Mike) would go over everything with us later and promised that everything was as discussed on the phone.  Shortly after, Mike had us start signing all the finance docs.  When we finally got to the numbers, the sales price shown on the paper was 500 more than what was agree to on the phone.  He explained that this was the price after the dealer fees were added to the sales price.  I told him this was unacceptable.  He left the room to discuss this with the manager and then came back and said that they agreed to give me the original price.  We continue signing papers and then he tells us our monthly payments.  We ask to see the document that shows how the payments were calculated.  It shows us paying 4.5% for 72 months.  Way more than we were promised. I explained that William had told us that we qualified for interest rates in the 1s.  He brought William in the room with us who said that's what he was told, then they brought in the guy who he said had told him that and he denied it.  The Finance Director, Amir then placed all the blame on WIlliam.  The whole experience was very uncomfortable.  I felt like everyone I dealt with was dishonest.  We ended up leaving with our vehicle.  1/2 way home I realized that in all the excitement, Mike (finance guy) had forgotten to take our 500 deposit.  We decided to wait for the dealership to contact us.  They called first thing in the morning and asked if we would pay over the phone.  I told them I would send a check.  I was upset about their treatment of me the day prior, so I was not going out of my way to accommodate them.  They did not want to accept a check, and asked if they could come pick up the money.  We agreed.  Mike said someone would be here later in the afternoon.  We waited at home all day long and no one ever came.  When I called to find out when they would arrive, Mike said they would not be able to make it today and would have to come the next day. I asked why no one had called earlier and he replied that they just got busy.  I then called the sales manager, Crayton Ronyon (spelling ??) to tell him about my negative experience at his dealership, hoping I would get some sort of sincere apology, but all he did was throw his employees under the bus and place all the blame on them.  He  did not accept and responsibility for what happened.  I would not recommend this dealership to anyone.  These guys are SHADY.  Nothing but a bunch of dishonest creeps.  ",1.6
