0,"June 01, 2020","Took van in for repairs, completed repairs but broke windshield, replaced windshield scratched dash up and left greasy fingerprints all over headliner, cleaned fingerprints but left large round stains in the areas where the fingerprints were. Nolan Casares at the service desk was great ( absolutely no complaints whatsoever about this guy, he was totally professional and polite ) took the van to have it detailed again right away. Once the van was done being detailed the service manager and myself walked out to inspect the car... some of the round stains were gone but two were still there, service manager David Quinn said they were just supposed to clean the fingerprints and implied I had put them there stating no chemicals they use leave stains and was really passive aggressive and honestly just an xxx, took the car to have it detailed AGAIN, came back and stated they were water stains and they got them out. Funny their chemicals don’t stain but water does right? As we were walking to the van he then stated” I noticed you have a sunroof too” implying the water was from the sunroof leaking I guess. Took absolutely no accountability for the stains or anything at all and never once apologized for anything. We had to take the van back 3 times for issues that were totally their fault and the service manager was still a complete jerk. I will never return to this dealership for any reason....if my truck blew up in their driveway I’d walk to town rather than even ask to use the phone at this place. ",1.0
1,"January 13, 2020","I purchased 2 vehicles from these guys, and both times when I tried to cancel the extended warranty and the gap insurance the finance manager Ryan Faglie lied to me about processing the refunds. They are quick to take your money and very slow to pay you back for any refunds. Which is usually typical of  of car dealerships unfortunately. Also buyer beware, they try to force you to purchase $300.00 worth of useless coupons for their service department. Both times I almost backed out on the deal until they took this off the table. PLEASE GO OVER YOUR FIGURES IN FINANCE TWICE AND DO YOUR HOMEWORK!!! THE FINANCE MANGER IS VERY SHADY....
To many places to go buy a  car from, I would pass on this place!!!",1.4

30,"May 25, 2016","So, two days after purchasing the truck, it died at a store.  It is having battery issues that we are working on getting resolved. 
My willingness to recommend this dealership depends on the resolution of the battery issue and a hope that there are no other immediate issues with the vehicle.  I cannot yet rate the dealership or recommend it. So, the answer above should be a maybe, depending on other factors.
I will say on the day of the sale, the sales staff was very friendly and helpful.  ",3.7

Fprtunately,  I had to travel through Gonzales, TX. and saw the Benny Boyd Dealership.  Decided to stop...  They had exactly what I wanted, there were no sales man / manager conferences -just- down to earth communications - NO PRESSURE!  We agreed upon a price and I purchased that day...

46,"April 08, 2016","While working in Gonzalez had a minor hiccup with my water pump.  Got truck over to Benny Boyd.  Since my truck is my mobile office, I requested that they check everything out while she was out for a day or two fixing the pump.  Vince called with list of items, including the water pump that needed attention.  He quoted dollar amount.  The service was performed as promised andbin time frame promised.  Thanks Vince and the entire service department at BB Gonzalez.",4.8
47,"April 04, 2016","this service call did not go very smooth for me. My AC was found to be leaking. My service advisor thought I had a 2014 but I had a 2015. So he wasn't aware that the 2015 required the new type of antifreeze which cost the customer a lot of money. He went ahead and had them to put in the new antifreeze without consulting me and this new antifreeze cost twice as much as the old. So to make a long story short, I ended up having to pay over $300.00 for a repair that I didn't authorize nor was I informed that this was taking place until  after it was almost finished. The service advisor said that my car was the first one that was done with the new antifreeze so he wasn't aware that it cost so much either. Well, that's unacceptable because if this is your business you should be made aware of all the pricing so that you can inform the customer ahead of time and get the approval before the work is completed. ",3.6
48,"April 04, 2016","The Vehicle wasn't where it should have been. First it was Bastrop, then Gonzales, then Lagrange and Lampasas.  It wasn't cleaned, the computer said chance oil, service said the oil had been changed, floor mats missing, and mixed match Tires, new Tires on the back and old Tires on the front. It was explained to me about the Tire tread and the Law and all, but who does that, new Tires on the rear and worn Tires on the front. In total, I made three trips to Gonzales from my home in Pflugerville to get things right. After buying new Tires for the front, I must say that at this point, I'm very satisfied with this Vehicle and how it performs.",4.4
49,"April 01, 2016","This was my first time using a Benny Boyd Dealership other than the one at Lampasas. I have to say the Benny Boyd Dealership at Gonzales was an excellent experience. The staff was friendly and kept me up to date on the progress of my Dodge truck. They answered all my questions as best they could. The waiting room was clean and comfortable. I walked into the showroom and met several nice sales people. Also, there seemed to be a large selection of new and preowned vehicles. I would recommend Benny Boyd at Gonzales to my friends without hesitation.",4.6

65,"March 07, 2016","FIRST OF ALL, When I purchased my truck at the Gonzales, TX  Benny Boyd October 28, 2015, I was referred by my brother,  who by the way, NEVER received his $100 referral fee as promised.  Today is March 7, 2016. 
I purchased the Express 5 warranty with the no-hassle understanding if anything needed repair or replacement,  it would be simple and handled at the dealership.  I didn't expect to get so much runaround for everything covered. Chip repair had to be sub-contracted. The tire repair turned into a replacement and the Parts/Service manager, David Quinn, insisted I had to pay first,  then fill out paperwork for reimbursement.  This paperwork was MIA at his office; I was responsible for calling and getting the paperwork.  Once I received the paperwork,  then he'd be ""happy to help fill it out,"" with me when I'd swing by. I don't live in Gonzales, so swinging by was not an option.  One day prior, I scheduled an appointment for the repair, assuming it meant I'd get in the shop before the walk ins. I was incorrect. I was told my warranty covered a rental car in lieu of waiting for my vehicle to be repaired (at time of purchase by their finance personnel).  Again I was misinformed. 
The ""appointment "" was simply to reserve time with an advisor for my vehicle.  Nothing else. As I sat and waited, advisor Kayla Fitch was informing a potential customer that, indeed, they had ""loaner cars"" for use throughout the day so the customer would be able to do some shopping in town. I was never offered a loaner vehicle.  I waited 2 hours for my tire to eventually get replaced, because the plug that I had used to temporarily stop the air leakage made the hole too big to repair. 
I asked twice for a loaner car: upon arrivAL and one hour later. It was at that time that service Mgr. Quinn informed me it would be only 30 minutes longer. He was wrong too, for it took a full hour longer before I had possession of my vehicle again. 
Advisor Fitch informed me that my replacement tire would be, ""Only $179.95, "" a price I wasn't excited about,  but understood tires aren't cheap.  Once again, price increased by $60 plus once I was at check out. I voiced my confusion and Fitch simply replied, ""This is with tax. "" I was not at all amused with her false information, lack of communication with this customer, and strong interest in her personal phone at her workstation. 
After paying, I requested the Service manager. Eight minutes later I voiced my concerns to him, and, of course, he defended his employee, threw his hands up about the paperwork for my reimbursement,  and attempted to tell me that they ""Do our best to get vehicles out as quickly as possible. "" Not so in my case. 
I called Express 5, spoke with Chris, who disagreed with David Quinn. When I printed out the paperwork for reimbursement,  the cover paper clearly states dealership needs to call for payment.

70,"February 18, 2016","Everyone that gets a new car is in love with those who help them...but...they have had to tell me no.  Last year, it is what it is.  If you have decent enough credit and a down payment, they will be able to help you.  They were polite and kind during my ""let down"" last year inviting me to come back again.  I did because they were so kind and helpful.  I am sure glad I went back to them.  I went in again this year, and they were able to help me.  They helped me find the car that was in by budget, but one I wanted.  They were so nice, and they were helpful.  I had a large enough budget to play with, I changed my mind...and they cheerfully understood and simply resubmitted new paperwork.  I really enjoye working with them and my car is a 2014 dream on wheels!  I got traditional bank financing, but if I wouldn't have been able to, they DO have vehicles that are on a ""buy here pay here"" program.  Either way, they will do what they can to help you.",4.8

74,"February 12, 2016","If you can find a better new car sales team in the State of Texas then please tell me.  My whole transaction was done over the phone and they brought the car of my dreams to me.  Where many dealers wouldn't even talk a number unless I stepped on their show room floor this dealership never required me to come and visit their dealership that is over 100 miles away.  As far as I'm concerned this dealership is right next door.  The whole transaction took two days after we identified what car I wanted (beat this, they went and found one for me since they didn't have exactly what I wanted) and two professional looking individuals came to my house to have me sign paperwork, go over the new car, and then take my trade.  I would call this Internet buying or would call this home buying as all the other Internet sales teams wanted to drag me onto their showroom floor.

Ryan (salesman) called his other dealerships and had the van brought to the lot before we got to the dealership.  It was just what I wanted so we purchased the van.  We got it for a good price.  The price was less that the other dealers around us.  If I were to buy another vehicle, I will go back to Benny Boyd and work with Ryan.  Thanks for the excellent experience.  ",5.0
87,"January 06, 2016","Great services. Very friendly. Awesome deals. Best we could find.

 The prices are the best, we did a lot of shopping around before we went there. Even their used cars were low mileage and had a great price on them.

Chris Mora, Newton Whiddon, Wesly Doss and Robert Mendez. Also they have been
there after the sale to answer any questions.

I feel confident in my purchase after dealing with the great employees at benny boyd gonzales. I live a good 2 hours away from this dealership and pass many on the way to it, yet I choose their superior service.  It's hard to make this experience as easy and fun as these guys did for me. Thanks for all your hard work!!",5.0

I am even more impressed with the service I continue to receive after purchasing a vehicle from them. Ed Fabela walked me through my car buying from start to finish and has contacted me since then just to see if I need anything. I would recommend Benny Boyd to anyone looking for a new vehicle.,5.0
