1,"March 20, 2020","I did not buy a car here, but I used the body shop to repair my new car which was hit in an accident. They did an amazing job. I was a little worried about the car being brand new, and everything looking right. The paint job and repair blended perfectly. They were fast and eager to help. Kudos to Erik and his crew! I highly recommend them if you need body work done on your car. ",5.0
2,"March 06, 2020","In the middle of a family member's hospital stay, my trusty old chevy's door handle broke off. I called All American Chevy, and Eric in the mechanic shop, ordered the part and even offered to come out to the hospital to put it on. We had the good fortune to be able to go home from hospital before the part came in the next day, We had been thinking about trading in, so decided to go take a look while they put on the handles. 
Gerald Smith and staff were wonderful and were able to get us in to a 2020 Chevy for about the same as what we were paying on the old one!  Thanks for really caring about my family.",5.0

11,"September 25, 2017","Long story short, the dealer runs an auction and lies to their customers. Basically if you begin the process of purchasing a vehicle and someone during the process offers them more they sale the car without giving you a curtosy. Casey and Josh lake integrity.

Go with ""Les Stanford"" Chevrolet, I found the right corvette and they were honest and professional with the whole process.

12,"January 14, 2017","PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do not take your car here for repairs.  
I took my car in and told them specifically what it was doing.  They kept my car for 2 weeks and charged me 500.00.  I picked my car up and it was doing the exact same thing it was doing when I took it in.  I called the next day and told them my car was not fixed.  They picked my car up and left me a loaner car.  After another week, they called and told me that they couldn't find anything wrong with my car.
I took my car to another mechanic, and it cost 400.00 to get it fixed.  It has run perfectly ever since.
The mechanic said the part All American put on my car had nothing to do with what was wrong.

As a single mom, this has been extremely hard on me financially.

PLEASE go somewhere else!",1.0

15,"August 31, 2016",I took my 2015 traverse in to check vibration noise in the front end. We drove the car and both agreed that the noise was on the front left and he assured me that if it was a wheel bearing it would be covered in the 60k drivetrain warranty. Well they then called and said it was not covered and cost $387. I agreed to fix it but when I picked up the car it still made the same noise. They had replaced the right side. They finally agreed to do the left side for the cost of the part but I couldnt wait that long so I fixed myself about 1 hr. and half cost. Point is they clearly made a mistake and tried to just pass it along which they did get their way. talked to others who had same type experiences.,1.0

20,"July 16, 2015","My son was driving from Florida to NM and came in with a broken axle, an ABS problem, and rotor and brake pad problems in the afternoon. The dealership had all the parts and stayed late to get my son back on the road the same day. Could not ask for better service than that. I'd definitely recommend All American Chevrolet to anyone that wants service.",4.6
21,"July 08, 2015","My Mother bought a 2015 Jeep Patriot at All American Chevrolet Slaton Tx. It had a brake squeal as soon as we got it. My Mother took it back and they said they could do nothing. ""Nothing"" except deglaze the brakes. After my getting involved and several attempts I called a Dodge Dealer in Lubbock. Without looking at it they stated they would turn the rotors and install new brakes. At this time the Jeep only has 2,000 miles. This means when we started it had about 500 miles and that's because I told her to see if it would go away, being it was new. 

Do Not Buy A Vehicle From All-American Chevrolet. The GM Mickey is a liar and fake. This is not a 5 Star Dealership. It is a Minus 3 Star Dealership. Don't forget the GM Mickey is a liar and Fake.

27,"December 25, 2013","We had a great experience at All American Chevrolet!  The SUV we wanted to see was in Midland.  Rob Hill (Sales Manager) offered to have it delivered here for me to look at.  He had it here that same day, and the weather was bad to add to the trouble.  He kept me updated the entire time.  When we arrived at the dealership Monica Salem (Internet Sales Manager) assisted us with the vehicle and initial paperwork.  The vehicle is in great condition and the price was great. The vehicle only had one of the computer chip keys and no key fobs, there was also a large crack in the windshield.  Rob and Monica made sure the windshield was replaced as well as the keys and key fobs!  Outstanding customer service!!  I did not encounter the usual back and forth negotiation bull crap.  We quickly and simply came to an agreement...NO HASSLE, it was great! Paul Herrera (Finance Director) was able to get me a great finance rate and answer all of my questions. Rob, Monica and Paul were very helpful and made my car buying experience great and hassle free.  I appreciate that very much.  I would definitely recommend them to anyone looking to buy new or used. I will certainly pay them a visit the next time I'm in the market for another vehicle. Thanks Rob, Monica and Paul...my best car buying experience to date!

Monica is a very honest individual and never did I feel that she was just trying to make a sell. I would recommend this dealership and most especially Monica. ",5.0
29,"August 07, 2013","My overall experience was good. I enjoyed doing buisness with Cameron. He was working hard to make the deal work. I have bought a lot of vehicles over my lifetime and is was a pleasure to see a young man really trying to work with his customers. The only thing I was dissapointed in was I told the new truck would be full of fuel and ready to go. Well, this did not happen and when ask about it, I was told management was not going to let Cameron fill the truck. I blame management for this. It was disappointing because I believe it was part of the deal. Management, a word of advice do not tell a customer something you do not intend to do. Cameron Stubblefield it was a please working with you. ",4.4

32,"May 30, 2013",I did not expect to buy a brand new car when I went into All American.  The sales girl I worked with was Minica and fr her to finishing in the business office they made the while car buying experience much more enjoyable than I have ever had before.

Thanks again guys! :),4.8
34,"March 27, 2013","I went to this dealership only because they had the exact truck I wanted. It was about 30 min from house and this quickly became a huge problem. When I bought the truck, I got it for a decent price but it was dirty because the week prior a dust storm passed through. I would miss a small dent in the hood because of this. I then went to Finance Manager Paul Herrera and this is where my problems started. It was a brand new truck so I didn't opt for any of the extra warranties. I made a mistake I admit signing all my paperwork quick because I was really late for work. I looked at my paperwork when I had a chance and Paul added $3500 extra warranties and said he would fix it. Never did. He kept telling me he would call me to remove it whenever my plates came in. Well they came in and he kept giving me the run around. He said he would give me a full tank of gas for running back and forth for paperwork. Never did. When I left my car for detailing for 4 hrs and came back, didn't even touch the inside. After they washed it, I noticed a dent in the hood and you guessed it, the dealership didn't do anything to fix it. One of the fuses already went out, and that wasn't fixed. I cancelled the warranties over the phone through the insurance headquarters, but meanwhile my monthly payment is an extra $70 a month for the 5 years. Cameron was a good salemans through the buying process, but failed to check in or fix any of the many problems I had afterwards. Overall, just poor customer service once you sign the dotted line. I made so many empty trips to this dealership and should have just gave my business to the local dealerlship.",1.2

38,"October 05, 2012","What a pleasant surprise it was to find a dealership that was straightforward and honest.  From the moment I walked in until I drove my new Tahoe home the buying process was actually enjoyable.  The salesman I worked with was Levi and he did everything to make buying a new vehicle pleasant and enjoyable (yes, you read correctly). The entire dealership was honest, straight forward and knew how to treat customers. I really enjoyed meeting and working with Levi who did a fantastic job of finding just the right Tahoe, getting me financed and out the door in a short amount of time.  I will continue to purchase my vehicles from here and will recommend them to all my family and friends.

39,"September 05, 2012","Hiram and Ruben have fed us nothing but lies the whole time we have been dealing with them. The finance manager is the only one that did a good job. After purchasing our vehicle they called and said they would come pick it up from us do a couple of small repairs to armrests, oil change, and detail and have it back to us in the same day. YEAH RIGHT, that did not happen!!! They picked it up, the service dept called 4 hours later and asked why they had the vehicle and what needed to be done when the salesman was suppose to tell them, they rushed to get it out the same day as we had been told, then Hiram and Ruben lied over and over again to us and said they would bring it when they closed, we waited up until 11:00 pm and no show, the next day (today) we will bring it as soon as we get done delivering another vehicle we were told, 6 hours later still no vehicle and numerous excuses as to why. Hoping to get my vehicle back soon since I was suppose to have it yesterday!!!!!!! Update: Finally got my vehicle back the end of the second day. The arm rests were fixed as best they could be, the oil change was done, the detail was NOT! They sort of washed the outside, streaking the windows, and did nothing to the inside except maybe squirt some air freshener in it. There was still dust and spills down the sides of the seats, the carpet had not been done or anything. The people in service seemed to be nice and helpful though, not sure if they are in charge of the detailing or not.",2.8
40,"August 27, 2012","Levi was the most Awesome and welcoming salesperson.  I came in nervous about being able to get a vehicle, and with him it wasn't an option, he was going to work with me until we got me in one.  When I left the dealership, I left feeling more like a family member than a client, and for me-- that is what it is all about.
He never said ""I don't know"", if he wasn't sure, it was always, ""I'll find out, or I'll check"" there was no question left unanswered.  I feel that this dealership is very fortunate to have Levi on their team, it is people like him that will help take away the ""car salesman"" stigma ( you know what I mean )
Thanks for everything and I will for sure send my friends there, it is worth the short drive.
Levi, thank you for being such a sweet, supportive and caring person.

52,"November 30, 2011","This dealership has exceeded my expectations by far. On previous car purchases from other dealerships in the Lubbock area, from walking in the other dealerships front door to driving away in my new vehicle has taken 5+ hours and left me exhausted from all the haggling and games I had to play to get my new vehicle.

Not so with All American Chevrolet. These guys are truly professionals. Kris Harmon answered my internet request on a Sunday, and had the new Chevrolet Avalanche I eventually purchased ready to test drive on my lunch break from work the following Monday. From the start of the test drive to making a deal took about 45 minutes TOTAL! No endless haggling and beating around the bush, just a fair price for all parties involved on my new truck and a fair price for my trade in.

5 Stars! Will shop All American Chevy first for my next car purchase",5.0

Once I made my decision to buy, Kris was willing to work with me to ensure I got the monthly payment I wanted at the interest rate I wanted, without an increase in my down payment or any concessions on my part.  Everyone at All American was accommodating about the fact that I was in a hurry and insured I didn't have to wait long to get everything done.     ",5.0

64,"April 04, 2011","I have never been so spoiled by a dealership.  Due to my job requirements, I only communicated with Ellis Hill by email.  I supposed over a two day period we communicated close to 35 times via email.  EVERY question I asked was answered and with enthusiasm.

Our purchasing experience was great.  In a laid-back envionment we chatted and worked on a good deal that served the purpuses of all concerned.  Small town dealerships are actually very attentive and appreciative.  

I look forward to receiving equally excellent care as a post-purchase consumer.  These people intend to keep you shopping there by their service and attention.  

All American is ""all right"".

I especially want to thank Staci Madrid he worked with me he was very honest & efficiant made me feel not only as a customer, but as a friend he wanted to make sure that I felt like he cared & wasn't trying to just make a sale. I really appreciated that I wasn't just a number to him. I had a prior experience at another dealership with a salesmen who practically left me almost in tears it's the frustration that I had with him I felt like he had been deceitful & when he knew he wasn't going to make a sale he moved on to the next person . It made a bad impression so I felt like all salesmen are that way. I decided to try again I am so glad I did thanks to staci I am so greatful for his time

we had tried to buy from the new ford house in Plainview, Texas.  They could not get the truck approved.
I really think they did not try very hard.  it tookthem over 4 weeks.  it took All American one day on the new truck and on the used because it was saturday we knew by monday.  

we have bought autos over 20 years and i can not remember being treated so well.

I would go back to this dealership in the near future to purchase my vehicle.  The only thing i would like them to change is if we could have one closer, had to do a 2 in half drive, but at the end it was worth the drive.  ",5.0
70,"February 23, 2011",This was my best car buying experience yet! Austen Lindsey was exactly what I was looking for in a sales person. He was not pushy or desperate seeming and listened to exactly what I told him that I was looking for. He showed me exactly the truck I described to him and didn't try to upsale me a vehicle that cost  $10000 more with features I was adament about NOT wanting. I had been to 4 other dealerships in the Lubbock area that morning and left angry because of salemen who wouldn't listen and didn't seem that interested in selling a vehicle. Austen and the salesteam worked very hard to make a deal and make sure I left in the truck I wanted at the price  I was willing to pay. I have recommended All American and especially Austen Lindsey to everyone I know and will continue to do so in the future. Keep up the good work All American!,5.0

75,"February 13, 2010",After looking all around Lubbock and Dallas we contacted Alex and he guaranteed he would do everything to earn our business. We were upside down with our trade in and he put us in a top of the line used vehicle (newer than our trade-in and with every feature possible) with a lower payment and interest rate than our original car loan.

Two days later they called and said they were still trying to work on some things, we weren't getting our hopes high well... because i had that feeling that it just wasn't gonna work out. The next day i was at work and i went out for break and checked my cell and had missed calls like crazy from Alex and Mack. I listened to my messages and Mack's message said ""to call back him"" and then after Alex's message said ""got good news, come pick up your car"" when i heard that i was like no way it can't be so i called Alex and it was so TRUE!!!!!

79,"January 14, 2010","I contacted Joshua by internet to see if All American still had a couple of Tahoe's that were listed on their website. From the first response to the time that we signed papers on my wife and I's new Tahoe, Joshua and Alex did a fantastic job of making sure that our wants and needs were taken care of. We had so issues with trade in, but they were not the fault of anyone at All American. Just had to do with the amount owed on the trade and what it was worth. In the end, we work a deal and got it done. My wife and I are very happy with the personal service that we got at All American in Slaton. I will recommend them to anyone seeking a new or used car in the future.

I utilized All American's Internet search & purchase capabilities to throughly review the current inventory, research Dodge trucks in general and to interact with Alex personally regarding what I needed in the way of a new truck. Alex was very helpful and sent me numerous emails during the process to answer all my questions and to pave the way for my face to face visit. Once I came into the dealership, I spent very little time in getting to the point of sale on a truck because we had covered all that ground before hand. I was in and out in a fairly short time and was very satisfied with the overall sales process. Given how busy we all are today, buying via the Internet is an excellent way to minimize the time lost in searching for and buying a car or truck. ",5.0

Dealing with Alex was kind of like dealing with family and I do not personally know him.  He never gave up on me.  I know I might of been difficult at times, but he stuck by me and asked me to believe him...I am sure glad I did.  Seems like everytime we were so sure of the car and the price I wanted...something would go wrong..either trouble w/financing..or someone else had already sold the vehicle.  After all that..He found me the perfect vehicle...for the perfect price.  It was all about being patient and that is something Alex has...He never stopped looking until he found what I wanted, and he NEVER lied to me...He always kept me posted on the exact situation that was going on...I will definately recommend him and his services to all my family and friends in the near future..Thank you Alex..I don't think I could thank you enough....
