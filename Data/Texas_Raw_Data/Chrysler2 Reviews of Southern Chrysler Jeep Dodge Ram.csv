0,"August 29, 2014","Drove into Southern Chrysler to LOOK at a car. The salesman pretty much threw himself in front of my car to get me to stop. But, I gave him a chance. I had a 2011 GMC Yukon, 58K miles Great condition, (it had a few dings nothing major). I was looking at a 2014 Dodge Charger. I brought my husband back to look at the car (he was leery of this dealership) started making a deal. The salesman came back and said that my Yukon was clean and a great vehicle according to the sales manager who drove it and he wouldn't mind having it for himself. They told us that they would give us $20K for it because that's what the blue book price had it listed at. WRONG!!!!!!! They had it listed at trade-in $25K - $27K! LIE #1! The Charger was stickered at $30K. and they told us that they had come off the price $4000. LIE #2! Come to find out after the deal that was the buyer incentive rebate. THEY didn't come off anything! They said that they would throw in having my windows tinted and a special spray that protect the inside and outside. All we would finance would be $4000. Okay it all LOOKED good on paper once they moved around a few numbers. I took the car into have the spray and the windows tinted. My car was there ALL day. They only did the spray on protectant. I was told they ran out of time and they would call me to let me know when to bring it back for the tint. I HAD TO CALL THEM!!! After a week. We have 3yr old twins and they took our car seats out themselves after I ask them if I need to remove them when I had the windows tinted. ""Oh no, they don't need to be removed"". LIE #3. They removed them did not tell me and did not secure them back when they put them back in the car. So I am driving down the highway and a truck pulls out in front of us I slam on my brakes to keep from hitting him and my children come flying to the front seat. I did not look at the car seats when I picked the car up because I was told they did not need to be removed. Had I of known that they had been removed I would have checked to make sure they were secured correctly. My children's SAFETY may not be important to Southern Chrysler Dodge. But it is to me! Now almost 5 weeks after we have bought the car we still have NO license plates or registration. I will NEVER send anyone to this dealership. I am MAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I feel Cheated!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! They LIED to us!!!!!!!!!! Oh, by the way they had my trade-in on their lot after a week for sale for $29K. REALLY it was only worth $20K according to them. A almost $10K profit, must be nice to screw people over like that!",1.8
