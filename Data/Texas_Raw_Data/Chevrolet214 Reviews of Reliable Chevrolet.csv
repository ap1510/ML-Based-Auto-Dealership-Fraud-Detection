0,"June 19, 2020","Recently I had a tire tread that was on the highway get kicked up by the vehicle in front of me and it damaged the driver side front panel by the headlight causing it to be pushed underneath my wheel well and knocked the sensor loose from the front bumper. I work down the street from Reliable so being this happened on my way to work I figure I would drop it off to have the repairs done there making it easier to pick it up once its finished. plus the fact that I have bought 2 trucks from them in the recent past. keep in my mind this my new truck that I just purchased back in October of 2019. A few weeks go by and finally my truck is ready for pick up. Excited to get my truck back I rush over to go get it on my lunch break. On my way home that evening I noticed the sound system in my truck doesn't sound the same. Come to find out my subwoofer and my amplifier are no longer working at all, but were working perfectly when I turned it over to them for the repairs. I make it a point to call the next morning and explain my concern but nobody is there. So I run down the street to the service area and was not welcomed by anyone. After walking inside and explaining the issue I was told you have to take it back to the collision center and not them. So over the weekend I start noticing that there is a loud sound coming from my driver side seat underneath when I drive over any rough terrain. Also I notice a sound coming from the dash to the left of the steering wheel. Then I just happened to notice the same fender that they replaced is now starting to pull away from the truck. At this point I'm very annoyed but figured ill call Monday and get this all sorted out. Monday comes and I call the guy who helped me through this whole process and explain the issues I'm having and we agreed I would bring it by that Wednesday and he would address the issues. I drop it off to him on Wednesday and I leave in a loaner vehicle and he stated he would try to have ready the next day. So later the next day I get the call that my truck is ready but he couldn't hear any sounds coming from inside the cab except for my seat belts hitting against the door panels. That not what the noise is by far. So he states come by and we will take a drive so I can show him the sounds. Well 15 min later I come by and he is not there so I leave with my truck due to having to be back at work. Here it is the next day and not only do I noticed that my fender that was fixed is now sticking out too far and equal to the other side, but my remote start is not working, mind you it was working all the way up until the day I dropped it off on Wednesday, and now my check engine light is on. Ran back by on my lunch break AGAIN and was told by the manager (not sure of his name) to make some time to leave it to have the bumper adjusted to fix the fender poking out and to schedule with the service department to have them look at the remote start and the check engine light. I have nothing against the sales team here and I have would buy a truck from these guys again but after the treatment I was given by the other departments I will never be back to do business here again. 

On a side note...Torrin Taylor and Billy Suggs are awesome and I thank you for my previous 2 trucks I purchased with you. ",1.2

4,"December 04, 2019",Every car I've ever purchased has been from Reliable--and there's a reason for that. Reliable continues to provide excellent service. I worked with JuanCarlos to purchase my 2020 Traverse. He was probably the best salesman I've ever worked with. He wasn't pushy (my biggest pet peeve when buying anything). He was extremely friendly. He was knowledgeable. I will continue to recommend Reliable and JuanCarlos to anyone I know that is in the market for a car. ,5.0
5,"November 29, 2019","Reliable performed a standard Oil and Filter change and applied the Zactek paint protection. My vehicle looked great, both inside and outside, after the cleaning and applying the protection. I also had a cable that was hanging down under the car and it was repaired very neatly. The entire service call took about three hours and was completed very professionally. Excellent Service Department. Highly recommend Reliable Chevrolet for both vehicle purchase and service. ",5.0

18,"July 19, 2019","Antelope Valley Chevrolet had been telling me for over a year that my car's rear brake pads were at 3mm and would need to be replaced soon.  When I traveled home to Richardson, I decided to take my car to Reliable Chevrolet to have the brakes pads replaced.  I try to divide the car repairs on my 2009 Cobalt between the two dealerships. Both provide excellent service and always understand my concerns.  Best part - my car was driving better, the tires were at exactly the tire pressure on the door, and my car had been vacuumed and washed.",5.0

25,"April 02, 2019","After trying other dealers and getting poor service, I went to Reliable.  That was 16 years ago. Brent Lewellyn has been our family service representative ever since.

27,"March 18, 2019","I have been a loyal customer for over 10years and spent over $250,000 at Reliable and you would think I could trust them. I called and talked to my regular salesman( Perry) about a vehicle advertised on the internet. I wanted to make sure the price was correct and the vehicle was available, he said yes.
I arrived the next day and the vehicle was waiting for me. I told him that I would take it. After waiting for over four hours the paperwork was finished.
A few days I was reviewing the paperwork and found a mistake, I went back to the dealership and spoke to the sales manager (Tim). He asked if those were my initials on the contract, I said yes. There is nothing we can do you signed.
I made the mistake of trusting my salesman and the dealership. This is the most expensive  mistake in my life, as a senior citizen and a disabled veteran I plenty of time to write to anyone that will listen about my treatment at Reliable Chevrolet.

28,"March 12, 2019","I was in the market for a $60,000 2019 Chevrolet Silverado Crew Cab, 4x4, LTZ, Z71 with Leveling Kit. I first dealt with Keith Collins until he quickly started ignoring my phone calls and e-mails. Then I dealt with Derrek Hosser (their General Sales Manager) who gave me even less attention. Then I went to David Williams who worked across the street at the time in their pre-owned division, who at first treated me okay but only after one week lost interest and stopped returning my phone calls and e-mails.

Folks if I’m going to spend my hard earned $60k on a brand new Chevrolet truck, I’m only going to do business with a dealership that will earn my business.

I will never shop at Reliable Chevrolet in Richardson, TX again.",1.0

35,"January 18, 2019","I purchased a 2016 Nissan Pathfinder from them October 2018 and it was the worst decision I've ever made. After purchasing the car many things went wrong. I had to get an oil change within the first month of having the car and they would not pay for it. They tried telling me that the oil change was done and they didn't reset the button however, the mechanic that did the oil change let me know it was needed. Tyler who was my sales person at reliable chevrolet the used trucks has been horrible as well. One of my tired went flat also before my first payment and I couldn't get the tire changed because there is a lock and I was not provided the key. So I had to buy fix-a-flat patch the tire and drive 10 mph from Garland, TX to Richardson. When I dropped the car off they were supposed to inspect all 4 tires. The mechanic I took my car to told me the tires are bad tires and the insides of the tires are horrible. I had to also replace the brakes the used trucks department of reliable chevrolet falsified the carfax and said they put new brakes on 2 months prior to me buying the vehicle however when I went to get new brakes the pads were rotted and the rotors were so bad I could hear them crunching when braking. All in all they sold me an unsafe car and I would never purchase anything from them. The sales guy Tyler keeps calling to say ""you can't prove this or that"" after purchasing this car I've paid over $1,000 in repairs. Also, do not take your car there to get repaired either they don't complete anything, never have loaner cars, and are backed up for no reason. Also, I still have yet to receive my license plates haha. This dealership as a whole is horrific. ",1.4
36,"January 14, 2019",I purchased a truck from Tyler Roliard and it was the easiest and quickest vehicle purchase I have ever been a part of. Not sure why I was dreading purchasing a truck.,5.0
37,"December 23, 2018","Eddy did a great job. From when my wife went there alone, they didn’t do the normal “take advantage of a woman”.... the process was very easy and simple compared to the 4 other dealerships that we walked away from because they were dishonest and wanted to milk us for every penny! Reliable Chevrolet cut right to the point and was fair for everyone.... 

Will use again next time we need a vehicle!!!!",5.0

44,"October 09, 2018","My wife noticed the (i) information light was on and the monitor was displaying 21 PSI. We could not find the nail, so we drove the car across town to the service department and we met Service Consultant Michael McDonald who took the time and was kneeling down rubbing the tire until he found it. The tire was replaced without charge and the customer service was OUTSTANDING. If you are a first time visitor... we highly recommend Michael McDonald as your Service Consultant.   ",5.0
45,"September 12, 2018","I have taken my truck to the shop over 10 times for warranty issues and they always deny my claim until I persist. They told me my engine was fine until I insisted it was not. They eventually admitted that it was shedding pieces of metal and they replaced some internal parts instead of replacing the engine. 2000 miles later I bring it to the shop because every time I check the oil there are 5 to 10 metal slivers on the dipstick. They admitted that my engine was shedding pieces of metal and had major issues but also told me that they can’t do anything until the engine seizes up on me or fails completely. I have a baby on the way and I do not want to be stuck on the freeway with a seized up engine. I only have 25,000 miles on the truck and it is only three years old. They should’ve replaced my engine 3000 miles ago rather than just replace some of the internal parts that had the most damage. They also admitted that my steering wheel is clicking when I turn the corner but said there is nothing they can do. They will always pretend you’re crazy and your vehicle is fine if you request a repair under warranty ",1.4

47,"August 17, 2018","I had my 2011 Silverado in for 30,000 mile service and later as I got on the highway my steering wheel was moving back and forth at 60 - 65 mph. We were planning a trip to Kentucky so I took the truck in to have Brent check out the balance of the tires. He said they were short handed and wasn't sure he could get to it. I needed it fixed to leave town. He said to leave it and he would see what he could do. I offered to go to another dealer but left it in Brent's care. Bren called a couple hours later and said it was fixed and the tires were out of balance. He test drove the truck and it was fine. I went to pick up the truck and I was surprised that I had to pay another 69.95 for tire balance when I had paid $1000.00 for 30,000 mile service a couple weeks prior, which included a ire balance which I had to pay for twice. But I like Brent's service and the dealership where I have bought all my trucks and suv's in the past.",4.6
48,"August 15, 2018","Center console on my 2017 Silverado died while on vacation to Indiana, went to Reliable when I returned for repair on a Saturday.  While the rep told me it might be Monday or Tuesday before they could check it out...he offered a loaner pickup (like mine) without my asking.

50,"July 23, 2018","I normally hate the car buying experience and put it off for a long time before I go to the dealership.  I usually do my research and print off the cars I am interested in to  make things faster.   When I got to there I told Keith, the sales person, my first pick of the Tahoes they had listed.  They had it in stock and I drove it and bought it.  The price was actually better than I expected.  I got exactly what I wanted and a good price.   The sales people were very knowledgeable, accommodating, and friendly.  The only problem for me was the long wait for the finance manager.  I know my credit score was excellent so no problem there but I had to wait about an hour just for him to call me in the office and then wait while he printed out each long lease form and then sign them all.   I think there must be some way to speed that along.  Over all, I was happy with the experience. ",5.0

184,"March 31, 2016",Our experience was very delightful. We went in on the information provided from an ad sent by True Car. Everything that was advertised proved to be correct. Once there the sales personnel did not try to interest us in another vehicle. We made the deal we went in for and drove the Chevy Silverado 1500 home that day.,5.0

190,"March 28, 2015","I dropped my car off at the service department early on Saturday morning. When I arrive, I was greeted with poor customer service from the start. All I needed was a diagnostic ran to figure out what was going on with my truck. I left my truck there close to 8:15am and called to check on it around 11:40am because I hadn't heard from anyone. They guy I spoke to said that they needed more time and that they would call me. At 4pm I had to call again and this time spoke to Bill, who told me that they hadn't even touched my car at all! It spent the entire day with them and they couldn't even run a diagnostic on it? Something doesn't make sense here. Nothing about this dealership is ""reliable"" and I will be taking my business elsewhere.",1.0

193,"July 28, 2014","My review is only based on the buying of the car, nothing can be said about the service department, as I haven't had any service done to the car yet, but will edit my review when that happens. Unfortunately there is a tear in the fabric on the roof of my car near the moon roof that needs to be replaced, and am waiting for the part to come in.  Was looking for a 2014 Impala 2LTZ, and found one at Reliable that fit what my wife and I were looking for. Met Francis, who was nice and showed us the car and let us test drive it. Next day after some more looking, and set on that being the car we wanted, we started the process of buying. Eventually met up with their financial guy, Jeff, who was a blast to talk to. He walked us through on everything (numbers, warranty, etc) and we pulled the trigger and bought the car. Everyone was friendly, no strong sales pitch, I guess since they aren't working on commission. Only negative was the amount of time all this took, over 5 hours, and when we were signing the paperwork for the car, the shop was suppose to have cleaned the car, detailed it a bit from the inside, and twice it looked like someone just went in with a wet rag and forgot spots to clean all over the place. Francis ended up driving the car back to the service shop and making them clean it a third time, and mind you we never said anything about how they cleaned the car, he took it upon himself to see and request they clean the interior right. Beyond that, it was a very positive experience and would recommend the dealership to those looking. As stated, don't know how the service department is, but once I do experience that, I will update my review.. (hence 4 stars for now, until I experience how their service department is with me and the work that will be needed to fix the tear in my car)  This is my first experience buying a Chevy/GM product, so I truly hope all goes well.",4.8

After telling the finance guy i only wanted to pay the price of the car and tt&l 4 times he said that sense they had won dealer of the year he wanted to do me some good and he got me a better interest rate got me a 6000mile 6month warranty
that would cover electrical. They say that i have a sensor in fuel system not working and of course it is not covered by warranty the finance guy shoved down my throat. I think they sold me a defected car and i think they knew about it.

209,"September 16, 2011","To be fair this is only in regard to the service dept. I have had VERY good experiences with sales and body work at the same dealer.

I have NEVER written a review about anything, but their service department is a haven for the lazy and apathetic. 

I dropped off my truck for a routine oil change and detailing. I'm assuming they changed the oil, but all joking aside, my truck was more dirty than when I left it there. I still had dust on the dash, wrappers in the cup holder, dirt on the floorboards, EXTREMELY dirty windows; a perfect example of what quality of work is generated when you employ people who don't care.

I came in to pick up my vehicle after a two week work trip, set down my bags outside, and was not given any form of even the most basic courtesy; the guy wanted me to WALK to 2 other departments just to get my keys, i finally got frustrated and told him he needed to ""pick up that phone in front of him and make this happen because I don't have time to do his job for him."" 

WOULD NOT RECOMMEND

211,"April 28, 2011","Mr. Aldridge was very helpful, particularly in the financing process. This was our second purchase from Reliable Chevrolet and because of our first experience with Mr. Aldridge, we returned for the purchase of our second Chevrolet (a 2011 Equinox). He was very thorough and patient in explaining the technology, bells and whistles, of the vehicle as well. 
Since I had reviewed the Equinox selection on the Reliable website I knew pretty much  what I wanted. The financial information was done via the website and telephone, and that made the buying process very easy and quick. Mr. Aldridge made some suggestions as to some of the options, etc. we might consider, so that when we finally went to the dealership and sat in the new Equinox it was the perfect vehicle for us.
