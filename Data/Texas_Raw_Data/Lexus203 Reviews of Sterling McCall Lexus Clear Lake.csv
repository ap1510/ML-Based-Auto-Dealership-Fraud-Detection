0,"January 27, 2020","I’ve been going to the Clear Lake Lexus since I bought my vehicle in 2017. I’ve been having issues with one of my tires being low. I would take it to get it fix, but they always told me everything was fine and would only put air In it. Finally after two years of complaining they found a small leak on the tire. When I asked why they took too long to find the leak, Service representative Sam told me because after two years the hole was big enough to detect. I’m very dissatisfied with this quality of service. I’ve wasted a large amount of time and money, for gas, for them not to resolve the issue after the first time it was reported. I was never offered any compensation for my loss of time and money all I was given was a bill for removal of the two year old nail, told to pay, and passively told to leave. I don’t mind paying for repairs; that’s the expectation of being a car owner. But what appeared to be a simple repair ended up costing me more than just the 19.99 they charged me. I love my Lexus and in the future I will probably by a second. However I sincerely hope service is changed for the better before then. ",1.0
1,"December 17, 2019","What a terrible experience! Please do not go in this establishment, because you will have to wait many, many hours to purchase a vehicle. Than when you do purchase ""said"" vehicle, you will still need to wait. 
Inspection
Fuel
Oil Change
Wash
I was there 5.5 hours on Saturday, and they did not accomplish but one of these. The inspection. WOW! I was asked to go eat and the car will be ready. So, I did go eat, fill up my truck. I was gone for about an hour wasting time, and my (now mine) car was not ready. I still had to wait another hour or two. Unacceptable, and someone need s to run a tighter ship, in the service department. I expected more from this dealership. I was very disappointed in the service the salesman Brian Emirler. I was at the ford dealership for 1 hour and purchased a F150 Platinum for my wife. iN AND OUT, NO HASSLE FOR A $60,000 PLUS VEHICLE. I bought a used mustang, and they kept me hostage for hours. Stay away! ",1.0
2,"October 04, 2019","I looked at the car over the weekend of 9/28/19. I went to look at the car on 10/1/19, made choice on 10/2/19. Daniel was off for two days and I didn't want to bother him. I called the entire morning of 10/3/19. I finally got a call back after 3pm. I completed the paperwork on 10/3/19 @ 7:30pm. Ron stated the car would be ready on 10/4/19 which was the reason I started calling at 9am on 10/3/19 so that the car would be ready. I was very happy that I was able to purchase this car with no money down. But, due to them not calling me back in a timely fashion, now I'm not getting the car at all. This is the worse service I've ever gotten in my 20years of buying cars.",1.6
3,"December 16, 2018","Brought my car in for Service. I do believe that everyone that works in service must be making 6 figure salaries. That is the only explanation I can give for the prices they charge. One example I wanted to update my GPS. You no longer can buy a disc you have to have service do it they wanted to charge $189 for the USB Drive which is not yours to keep then they wanted to charge close to $200 to download the information.
They charged me $275.05 in labor to change out a sensor. They charged me $235.00 in labor for rear brakes. I dont know if this is just Clear Lake Service. I will be talking to Lexus Corp. about their charges.",1.8

5,"April 20, 2018","Lexus called me to schedule an appointment.  I got to the appointment and stood for 15 minutes waiting on a valet to take my car keys.  There was no one.  Beware, this dealership overbooks their service appointments.  They were packed.

Also, if you have a Lexus GS 350, beware of the tires.  They will, without warning, come off.  I had to replace them with Michelin's at my own expense after they refused to replace the tires -- at the time of the incident, my car had 5,000 miles on it. ",1.0

46,"October 31, 2017","First off, let me let you know that this e-mail will fall on deaf ears since my wife's sales person (David Marrow) is held is such high regard with your dealership that he is probably above reproach.

My wife and I went through Hurricane Harvey and had four and a half feet of water in our home. We lost our vehicles and came looking at your dealership for a replacement.

Another thing, we had just purchased a replacement vehicle from another local dealership. At this dealership and after looking at the vehicle, we decided that we were interested in making the purchase. We also let them know that the tires were in pretty bad shape and the leather seats needed some repairs. This dealership purchased us a new set of tires and had the leather seat repairs done prior to our purchase. They also lowered the asking price by a few thousand dollars. Since they treated us so well, we made the purchase. We are now considered part of their family.

My wife (Lisa Bourg) found a vehicle that she liked on your web site and decided to go in and take a look at it. Lisa went in and she was met just inside the doors by your sales person David Marrow. He showed her the vehicle and she decided that she liked it enough to have me meet her on a different day to take a look at it. After looking, at the vehicle, we noticed that the front tires were down to the tread markers. We went inside and sat down with Mr. Marrow. Mr. Marrow disclosed that the vehicle had been damaged on the right rear quarter panel and rear bumper. He said that the damage may had been caused by one of your dealership's employees. He also said that they would repair the damage before we took the vehicle. I mentioned to Mr. Marrow that the front tires needed to be replaced and asked if your dealership would have them replaced. After a while of Mr. Marrow leaving to speak with what we suppose was the on duty used car manager, Mr. Marrow came back and told us that ""your dealership"" did not have the money to replace the tires. I reminded him of the excellent customer service that we had recently had and asked him if your dealership would just let us walk out without the vehicle over the price of two tires. Mr. Marrow told us that your dealership would let us walk out. What a way to run a business. I was ready to leave but my wife liked the vehicle. A counter offer from your used car manager would have been nice but your dealership did nothing extra to help these flood victims out and make us want to recommend your dealership to any future auto buyers. We decided to go ahead and make the purchase. It is a shame that your dealership does not conduct an inspection of the used vehicles you take in so that you can offer them a certified. We understand that many things that need to be addressed prior to selling a car are taken care of prior to becoming a certified used car.

My wife also wanted the windows to be tinted prior to our picking up the vehicle. All of these things were completed and we arrived to pick up the vehicle. Upon inspecting the right rear quarter panel and rear bumper repairs, I decided to take a look at the inside of the vehicle. I noticed that there was some damage on the driver's arm rest that was pretty bad and that the speaker in the driver's door was making a loud buzzing sound. Both of these things needed to be repaired. We mentioned these things to Mr. Marrow and he told us that it is a used vehicle. I asked Mr. Marrow if he knew about the damage to the arm rest prior to my wife ever looking at the vehicle. Mr. Marrow told us that he did know about the damage but he did not consider it to be an issue so he did not disclose the damage to us. First off, Mr. Marrow is not purchasing the vehicle and as an employee of what is supposed to be an honest, reputable dealership had an obligation to disclose any and all issues that the vehicle had. He offered to have your upholstery repair person look at the arm rest and asked my wife to send him a photo of the damaged arm rest so that he could set up a time for us to meet with the repair person. My wife sent Mr. Marrow the photo but we have never heard from Mr. Marrow or the repair person or anyone else from your dealership again. Since my wife liked the vehicle, we decided to go ahead and complete the purchase.

Just before we left, Mr. Marrow told us that since we made the purchase that we were now considered to be ""part of the Lexus of Clear lake Family"". He told us that your dealership feeds the staff pretty good on Saturdays and that we were always invited to come in for a free lunch. My wife and I do not feel even close to being family members of Lexus of Clear lake.

As a result, we have had to pay a third party to repair the arm rest and we will be purchasing two new tires and having the speaker in the driver's door repaired or replaced. Not only will we not be coming in for a free lunch, but we will not ever come in to look at any vehicles (we still have one to replace) or will we recommend your dealership or Mr. Marrow to any future possible customers. You know how the saying goes.....happy customers rarely tell anyone of their experiences but unhappy customers tell everyone. ",2.2

85,"July 26, 2017","I have bought 4 or 5 LS series since 1990 and have received outstanding service, On 7-25-17 I turned my LS460 in for wheel balancing and a detail of the car. At the Service area my service tech had moved from an office to a cubicle area shared by 2 techs---and no chair or privacy to be with the customer. A key factor in buying another Lexus is the service. What is going on here??
Another change is now you go to a service reception area to obtain a loaner which has 3-4 workers. It took 27 minutes to obtain the paperwork for the loaner----in the past my service tech had it done in a few minutes---What is going on here?? 
The overall facility is outstanding---great customer waiting area--open area with TV--quiet area--and work area with devices. Coffee and refreshments available--very clean and comfortable.
But who and why the service tech changes--RETHINK them whoever you are!!

We're from GA and were traveling in the area when our Lexus had a serious problem. The tie bar for the front right tire suddenly snapped and the tire was facing at a right angle to the left tire which was facing straight. The car was jumping, lurching and difficult to stop. We were fine but on the road in a small town late on a Saturday afternoon. We were able to get our insurance tow service to respond but now had to find a place to take the vehicle. I called the nearest Lexus dealership, Lexus of Clear Lake. Our Lexus that we had never had any problems with and with over 200K miles, was no longer under warranty. 

I spoke with Michelle and immediately, she wanted to know if we were okay and safe. She got the pertinent info and said to have the tow brought to their shop, they would expect us. After After 30 minutes the tow co. called to say they'd be there in 15 mins. Michelle also called to be sure we were okay and that we did have a tow or they would send someone. When we arrived at Lexus of Clear Lake, Michelle greeted us and said Sierra would take care of us but was tied up at the moment. Instead of having us wait, Michelle said she would get us started. Sierra soon took over and we were speaking with the Maintenance staff within 10 minutes. 

They were an excellent team, showed true empathy for our situation and did an outstanding job in getting us a Loaner vehicle and on our way quickly.

145,"August 01, 2016","Don't trust these liars.

Never in my life have I ever dealt with a used car dealership as unprofessional, shady, and full of outright liars as with Lexus of Clear Lake. My wife and I were interested in purchasing a used Accord from the dealership, negotiated a price, applied on line and was approved, arranged the downpayment, and was told the paperwork was being FedEx-ed to us (we live in Austin).We arranged to have needed repairs done at a fellow Group 1 dealership, along with a pick up time, and the ability to turn in the rental car in Houston when we drove down. Well turns out, the dealership (without consulting us mind you) wanted to hit its monthly goal, so on the last day of the month the dealership turned around and sold it to someone else. 

So not only did the dealership lie to us, waste a week of our time, forcing us to start back and square one and pay for a rental car out of our pocket, but they also ran my wife's credit without delivering the promised goods. I know you aren't supposed to trust a used car salesman, and in this case it appears as if the dealership went behind the back of its salesman, which takes shadiness to a whole new level. I would not trust this dealership with your time, your money, or your credit as they are FLAT OUT liars.

Do yourself a favor and go somewhere wear they do as they say, honor the contracts they write, or at the very least, tell you before they sell the car you thought you already bought. I cannot stress enough that this was not a verbal or handshake deal, the paperwork was ready to be signed, and these crooks sold it to someone else. Completely unbelievable. Avoid these crooks at all costs. Thanks for nothing.

149,"April 25, 2016","I recently purchased a Certified Pre Owned 2013 ES 350 with 18,000 miles on it. Almost immediately, I notice as I'm backing out of my driveway, the brakes are scratching a little bit and something seems off. I take my care in for my initial 5,000 mile oil change and mention to the dealership about the brakes. They explain this car only needs an oil change at 10k miles and to come back and then they will look at the brakes and change my oil for me (first oil change is no cost). 

When I did come back at 10k miles, I'm told the reason my brakes are giving me problems is that the rotors are bad. It was at this point, I also noticed I had 3 Michelin tires and 1 other brand tire. This all seemed pretty fishy to me. I talked to the manager of the CPO program and after a lot of back and forth, I asked him to see the CPO inspection report they use to 'certify' a car. Well the report showed no problems with the brakes and 4 matching tires. I brought this to their attention and I was told the warped rotors were probably caused by me driving through water and the mismatched tires was probably just a typo (even though the report is just checked off). They then offer to take a used tire off another car or just find a used tire that matches my other 3. I declined this offer. 

I reached out the GM, Mike Shaw, but he was  no help. He dug his heels in that rotors are a wear and tear item only. When I asked him to comment on the CPO report being wrong about the tires, he totally stopped responding to my emails. 

PLEASE don't fall for the ""Certified Pre Owned"" trap that I fell into. I paid more money thinking my car was thoroughly inspected to considered 'certified' but obviously this is not the case. If you do consider buying one, make them show you the report, and go over your car from head to toe. Also keep in mind, Clear Lake Lexus is just another used car dealer. The put profits ahead of customer satisfaction. Don't pay extra and don't fall for the CPO 'marketing' hype. I learned this the hard way. ",1.0
150,"April 14, 2016","I am VERY dissatisfied with the service and experience of Lexus of Clear Lake. I purchased a 2014 Hyundai Equus from this dealership approximately 2 weeks ago and have had repeated failures in communication and service since then. I am a prior Lexus owner  (several times )who has previously had exceptional service and experiences at local Lexus dealerships. I have never bought a car out of state but considered purchasing from this dealership (since I live in North Carolina) given my positive past experiences and the exceptional reputation of the brand. What followed was truly disappointing and frustrating: 
The sale seemed to be proceeding well  - up until the delivery of the car. The car was picked up to be shipped by the transporter without notifying the salesperson. I was told the car was to be delivered late at the end the work week. Instead, I received a call in my office in the middle the workweek during a busy patient day. I was told that my car was to be delivered sometime that afternoon. I was unprepared to physically meet the transporter since I am healthcare provider and was seeing patients still very late. The transportation company was inflexible insisted that I accept the car that afternoon (even insisting delivery  at my office when I was seeing patients). After several negotiated attempts,  I finally agreed to delivery at 8 PM that night (as communicated by the sales person). The driver did not arrive till almost 10 PM as I was trying to put my daughter to bed. He was extremely rude and insistent that I accept delivery of the vehicle. The condition of the vehicle was not what I had seen in the pictures. The vehicle was absolutely filthy on the outside and dirty on the inside. The rear tire was almost flat and there was virtually no fuel in the tank. 
Additionally it took over a week and a half to get my sales paperwork from the dealership. I had the car without the sales contract.
 I complained about the rude experience, poor condition, and lack of my copies of the sales documents to the dealership that evening. My salesperson apologized by saying  -”this never happens but I should have been happy that they delivered the car early”  He mentioned that the concerns would be communicated this to upper management. After several phone calls to repeat my complaints- The dealership simply offered $50 for “detailing” or they could “just come by and pick up the car if I wasn't satisfied”. I would not accept the first offer and mentioned that picking up a financed car was not as easy as just handing them the car keys at this point. I asked to speak to the general manager Mike Shaw. I received a text from the salesperson mentioning that I could call him at my convenience. I have left him several messages with no reply. I have called the ”customer service manager” and left several messages with no reply. Almost a week has passed with zero contact from the dealership.
I have had to pay to thoroughly clean the entire car(inside and out)  and replace the rear tire that will not hold air. No one will take my calls or answers the phone.  Now that I have purchased the car, I am ignored.  I have never had such a poor experience at a Lexus dealership.  I will never again make the mistake of purchasing a premium car sight unseen.  Very frustrating and disappointing!

164,"April 10, 2015","Bad service department. We had  a terrible experience yesterday 4/9/2015 for recall service. Will not recommend Lexus to anyone and will not buy Lexus ever again. Service adviser RYAN RODRIGUEZ made no attempt to speak with us and told us to reschedule because they were too busy.


Brought in my Lexus IS250 for a fuel gasket recall that may cause fire. I had a 1030 appointment and brought someone to pick me up while car is the shop for an est 4 hours of work per letter received by Lexus. 

Arrived at 1015 and was told to wait for our service adviser RYAN RODRIGUEZ. 15 minutes passed and it was 1030 we checked in with the friendly receptionist and she told us he just stepped out and will call us up shortly. Ryan came and shouted for a Cindy with no response and left. I received a phone call with voice-mail that he was looking for us and called me Cindy. We walked up to the receptionist and told her what had happened and she went to get him and he was nowhere to be found. Told us to wait again. Another 15 passed and we asked for him again. He was busy with someone else. 

At this point we realized he skipped us. We ask for someone else to help us. Receptionist talks to him again and he walked out to the receptionist and told her to have us reschedule as they don't have a loaner available. 

I am baffled, we didn't need a loaner. I just came to drop the car off and I've been waiting 45  min to drop my car off. I asked for someone else or even a supervisor after the 4th attempt to just drop my car off and all I get was wait for Ryan who I overheard told me to reschedule.

When I did get to talk to a manager. JESSE RODRIGUEZ he told me that he will take care of it and took down my number so he could call us when its done. 

Got a call at 1300 by Ryan called saying the car will be done tomorrow at noon. I asked for  loaner and he says he is out of loaners. I ask to speak to Jesse the manager and he tried to get him for me and came with some excuse and told me that they will try to get a second team to have it fixed by today or find a loaner for me.

Car was done at 1700 and picked it up. RYAN who I saw in his office didn't even want to see me, he made the receptionist give me the paperwork to sign. 

No explanation of what was done to the car. The paperwork shows they did more than one recall.  When I dropped of the car I didn't sign anything. They didn't call me to tell me what was going too get done. 

I came in with the intention of looking for another Lexus while my car was in service and will never consider Lexus ever again. Lexus standards are higher than any other brand as they compete with BMW or Mercedes and this stint really shows they need to improve on their professionalism and customer service. 

I praise the receptionist for good service as she sensed that we were getting upset and trying not to show it. She went to get the manager when Ryan was too busy on the 4th attempt to have someone else to just accept the car for our appointment. Jesse the manager tried to get everything squared and would look for where the miscommunication occurred. I did not hear from him and see him. Really bad customer service.

Will be looking to trade in car with BMW next.",1.0

We were told certain features were included in car which were not than APOLOGIZED for.  Some features stopped working few days later, it took almost a YEAR to fix and APOLOGIZED for.  I was asked to come in on Tuesday for repair ANYTIME after 10 am. I came at 11 am as advised and told to come back at 1 as the gentlemen who handles the work was not going to be there until after lunch.

It has been a very horrible experience for us since we purchased our car from them.  All we get are APOLOGIZES which doesn't fix the problem. From what I've seen, i think because we are Asians, they don't give us any importance.  It has been a terrible experience and I would not recommend anyone to this dealership.  I've purchased a Toyota and a Acura and never had such an experience.

I had to get Lexus Customer Serivce involved before my matter could be resolved which was also a horrible experience. Every person i spoke to gave me a different answer EVERYTIME, than the person i spoke to next, would apologize for the information i was given prior :(

When I explained that we had scheduled a loaner car, he was defensive and exclaimed, ""who told you that?"" While never making eye contact, keeping his back to us while typing on his computer. 

After leaving Mr. Sweet's office, I asked to speak to a manager. Scott Tyler spoke with us and was very professional and listened to our concerns. I appreciate Scott taking the time to speak with us however, this is our last purchase at Lexus of Clear Lake.

182,"October 14, 2011","A major reason for continually purchasing vehices is the after the sale experience. Tim Day at Clear Lake Lexus is one of those unique individuals who totally enjoys his role as Service Technician (Master Certified) And &amp;amp;amp;quot;advocate&amp;amp;amp;quot; for the customer. I have been going to this dealership since 2000 and return for all of my automotive maintenance--a key reason is Tim and the 100% satisfaction level that I achieve each and every time. He is immediately responsive to my each and every need--explaining the issue and the options for resolution in a logical, thorough manner so it can be understood by both the layman and technically inclined individual. Tim personally works with me when I arrive for maintenance or have a question--when he is on vacation, I stil receive very good service--but Tim is the ultimate customer interface individual for me at Clear Lake Lexus. I will be purchasing another vehicle there when the new model is announced---Tim is the most significant reason for me buying it at this dealership. In today's world of stress and everyone being so busy--it is more than just nice to have a person such as Tim who cares to your every need with your Lexus car who I also consider to be a friend.

The overall environment at Clear Lake Lexus has constantly evoled into what it is today--an experience that supports the casual and busines requirements of the customer.This includes an area for parents with children, complete Wi-Fi, TV area, quiet area for the working individual, sales, and restrooms plus parts/serice.

Note: I recently had an issue with the front passenger seat belt--would not lock into the slot, Tim immediately ordered the replacement part to have it repaired. While waiting, Tim went to retrieve my handicap plaque for me--noticed that the glove box had an issue. It is this attention to ensuring customer satisfaction and the attention to detail on servicing the Lexus vehicles that make Tim Day stand out far above others in his field. I might add that he had the full support of the service and repair management to ensure the prompt resolution at an extremely favorable resolution.

Danny Smith was the salesman who was suppose to be assisting us, however he was not even interested in helping us out, perhaps it was due to our age or maybe even ethnicity. Danny was unaware what was even listed on the lexus.com price for the vehicle I was interested in. Danny was also unfamiliar with the three packages which Lexus cells with their vehicle. He tried to belittle us multiple times, first asking me in a condensing manner how long I have been driving. Then he simply told us outside his office in front of the automatic entry doors that he would simply not negotiate. Danny additionally asked a gentleman behind the counter if he could knock down $5.00 off the price, which was the last straw. I cannot speak for any other person at this dealership, for I am not sure how they treat their customers, but if you plan on purchasing a vehicle from Lexus of Clear Lake, do yourself a favor and DO NOT DO BUSINESS with DANNY SMITH.
