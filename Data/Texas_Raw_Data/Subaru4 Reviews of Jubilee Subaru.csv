0,"March 10, 2018","Brought my Subaru here for an EVAP issue. They replaced TWO AIR valves. The vehicle showed NO SIGNS of the air intake system needing repair and the engine code even said EVAP. $2100 and multiple lies from Emmanuel the service adviser, Dave the service manager, and Bart the GM and we are told $700 more to fix the initial problem because they deceived us.

We will be looking into a lawyer. Do yourself a favor and go else where. They are scam artists and liars!",1.0
1,"June 27, 2017", They didn't disclose their hiring practices accurately on a craigslist ad for one so I doubt they disclose everything to prospective buyers. I'm in the market for a new Subaru after recently totaling my last one in a wreck so I figured I would stop by and talk with someone about the job opening as well as purchasing a new vehicle. After the experience I had today I will definitely buy a new car elsewhere. I made a long drive into Waco only to be treated rudely and told no one had time to meet with me. The receptionist was rude and the entire staff seemed subdued. I didn't see a single smile in the whole place. They alienated someone who is not only over-qualified for the open position they have but a potential Subaru buyer as well. ,1.0
2,"March 31, 2017","Bought a new BRZ here and was blown away by the low pressure sales staff, I came in and test drove several times before I was ready to do anything and then when I bought the finance manager was very thorough and happy to answer all of my questions and walk me through the contract. I haven't had a chance to bring my BRZ in for service yet but Brent did set up my first appointment and assured me that the vehicle included 2 years of complimentary maintenance.",5.0
3,"December 23, 2015","Purchased a new Outback in 2012 and added a gold service warranty plan ($100 deductible) at a great price from Subaru.  Such a good price for basically ""bumper to bumper, assumed would never have to use it. 2012 Outback now has 87K miles and only one other early repair needed.  

Took car in for problem with car jumping and dying as I would come to a stop at stop signs. Service department wanted me to sign a form for $95 charge to diagnose the issue. I tried to explain I had the gold plan for warranty work but finally gave up.

Service department indicated new torque converter needed so I picked up the car for a planned trip and they  preordered  the parts and indicated they would keep car overnight so bring in Monday morning.  Tuesday noon no update so call to dealership and they indicated they were using the tool needed for my repair on another car and would start working on mine Tuesday afternoon and should be completed either Wednesday or Thursday. They indicated they would call me with an update but I ended up having to call them on Tuesday to get the update. 

I got call Wednesday morning they had converter removed and repair should be completed on Wednesday afternoon.  Second call that it was completed.  Made the mistake of voicing my concerns about timing and had a short very unpleasant visit with, I understand the General Manager.  Now I understand why they might have some customer service issues.  

Thankfully my warranty is about to expire because I would not want to go back to them, based on the GM's attitude including his indication he did not want my business. 

Bottom line is the estimated 5 hour repair job took them three days to complete and the GM indicated that was ""good"" service. I wonder what they would consider unsatisfactory service.
