Purchased a newer used vehicle from Sherman Chevrolet and the car started skipping the very same day on our way home. Newer vehicle with 40,000 miles and when I returned the SUV they told me the car needed a new transmission. UGH!! I purchased the vehicle because I thought dealerships did a thorough inspection of used vehicles before they are put on the lot. We paid nearly $35,000 for a vehicle that we learned two days later needed a new transmission??? I was livid - but I guess that explains the hard sale in the finance room for the extended warranty that we planned to purchase through our bank. Might I add we took the vehicle back within days and it took nearly a month to fix. While the car was in the shop I ask the service manager to fix the winshield that had a small chip and buff out a scratch on the side of the car. When I returned to pick up the car nearly a month later and after calling serveral times to ask what was taking so long for the transmission. They returned my car to me dirty, with no gas, the windshield had not been fixed nor the scratch buffed out on the side of the car. I clearly expressed to the manager that I was unhappy. I ask the manager for a number for Corporate - the manager said he was uncomfortable giving me the number and told me they would have someone contact me - REALLY!!! Just an overrall horrible car buying experience. They did go ahead and wash the car but told me I had to fix the chipped windshield and scratch on my own which I would have had them do - had they communicated that to me during the nearly month long they had my new car. BUYER Please BEWARE and get EVERYTHING IN WRITING when dealing with Sherman Chevrolet.

2,"November 18, 2018","They loaned the car I wanted to buy out through the service department, and still expected me to sign the sales contract on it while I was there (even though someone else was driving it all weekend!). What a waste of my time, and a pointless pull of my credit report. They did not offer/honor the available Chevrolet rebates, lying and telling me ""it was already built in to the price"". I will stay far away from these scam artists and stick with Holiday Chevrolet!",1.0
