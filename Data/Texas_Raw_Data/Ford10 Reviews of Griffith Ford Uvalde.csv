0,"June 19, 2020",I am a repeat customer of Griffith Ford. Arnoldo Silva and his associates have always gone to great lengths to get me the car I need at the price I can afford. This is my second Ford Escape. They are always so friendly and easy to communicate with. They made the car buying experience a breeze.,5.0

8,"August 03, 2015",Took truck in with a leaking water pump staff was super friendly and mechanic was very knowledgable but something has now happened where truck is getting hot. Called the service center back to hear mechanic is not at work call back tomorrow. when I did he had no recollection of what could have happened. Asked to talk to service manager and he also wasn't at work left my phone number and called back 4 other times with no luck getting him or a return call. Asked for pricing on a new truck and it took them 8 hrs to get back with me. Now 3 weeks later still have a truck getting hot and no help dealing with it. I live 4 hrs away and my local ford dealer won't warranty this work since they had nothing to do with the initial work!! ,2.8
9,"July 16, 2013","My husband and I heard a noise coming from the rear of the vehicle. I assumed it was the brakes. To confirm we brought the car in to have the brakes inspected. After a long wait, the mechanic came in and advised that the brakes were fine and it was the motor mounts on the car that needed to be replaced and stated in the repair quote that it would be $1200 or around to have all three replaced. Of course that is a large sum of money and we decided to wait til we could pay for it. After a couple of weeks, we heard the noise again, and again, we noticed it was coming from the rear of the car. My husband removed the drum brake cover and there it was, a piece had fallen off of the brake and one side was so warn. They advised that our brakes were fine and that was clearly not the case and tried to manipulate us into believing that the motor mounts needed to be replaced, but in fact that was not the case at all and they never checked the brakes properly!!!! I feel that they delibertly lied to make more money. The motor mounts do not need to be replaced.",2.6
