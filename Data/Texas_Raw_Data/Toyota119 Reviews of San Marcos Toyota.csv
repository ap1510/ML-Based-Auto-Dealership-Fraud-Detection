0,"April 29, 2020","We would like to give a big shout out to Megan in Sales and Cowen in Finance, for giving us a wonderful experience at San Marcos Toyota.

My wife and I were looking for a larger SUV, and consistently ran into high pressure sales tactics and other issues at Houston area dealerships where we live.

We expanded our search to a 200-mile radius, and found a Certified Sequoia at SMT with low miles and the exact features we were searching for.  Despite the challenges of the pandemic, Megan was very responsive and answered all our questions remotely for a week until we were able to make the 3 hour drive to see the vehicle in person.

When we arrived at SMT, the vehicle was clean/parked out front and exactly in the immaculate condition advertised.  Megan worked around our schedule and even came in on her day off to meet us.  She was honest, patient, and knowledgeable during our test drive, and we did not feel pressured at any time.  We ultimately decided to purchase the vehicle, and the entire process went smoothly.  During financing, Cowen was a straight shooter and overall we felt that we received a great deal.  They both worked extremely hard to earn our business and respected our time, knowing that we had to drive back to Houston on the same day.

We highly recommend San Marcos Toyota for anyone in the market for a new or used vehicle, and will be reaching out to them in the future when it's time to replace our other vehicle.

2,"March 16, 2020","San Marcos Toyota is the worst. They sucker you in to buying a vehicle then adding an extended bumper to bumper warranty only to be told later on that the check engine light/trac light issue may not be covered by your warranty and the full diagnostics cost and repairs would be the owner’s responsibility. Law suits across the U.S., regarding rodents chewing through electric wires are arising due to soy versus petroleum based wiring and that it’s not their fault that a rodent chewed through the wires. In fact the Assistant Service Manager Michael Holder, compared the situation as being no different if he himself were to go under the hood of my vehicle and snip one of my wires. As if animals know that they ought to be aware of right from wrong. This is very disappointing in the sense that I’ve spent thousands of dollars with their dealership and their companies products, that obviously they will not honor. Dishonest salesman, personnel and companies like San Marcos Toyota, should be ashamed of themselves for pushing hard to get you to sign on the dotted line, only to be pushed out the door as just another suckered customer. 

Saddened customer ",1.0

My overall experience on buying my first brand new car was pretty cool. ",5.0
8,"September 27, 2019",I love working with people who are happy to do good work - ie a fair car buying experience. There is nothing worse than meeting with a car salesman and telling them your budget only for them to turn around and show you a fabulous car that is out of your range. I went in with a mission and price point and Charles exceeded all expectations in that experience. ,5.0
9,"September 13, 2019","When buying a car from out of state, you have to trust the condition report of the vehicle. I was flat out lied to. Absolutely horrible. Won’t pass inspection. Dash warning lights on. Leaks, multiple sensor issues, and the manager refuses to do anything. Typical used car salesman mentality. Lie, cheat, steal. ",1.0

15,"July 30, 2019",1st visit to this dealership. Very pleased with service and a thorough explanation of their findings. The service advisor Bryan Bond was excellent and the service staff were focused and stayed on task. Came here because of bad experiences at NE San Antonio Dealership. I’ll definitely be back. Thanks Richard Hudkins,5.0
16,"July 30, 2019",Went to get a headlight fixed.  It had a short.  They said although I had the platinum extended warranty the short wasn’t covered.  I expected to pay for the headlight but was quoted over $300.  I obviously went elsewhere but was still charged for the short.  Was told they would try and file the claim for warranty on Monday morning and call me to let me know if it was covered.  Never got a call back.  The service advisor was friendly during the process but the pricing and lack of warranty coverage were very disappointing.  Less than impressed with the experience.  ,3.0

22,"July 14, 2019","Got the car I wanted in quick order. After shopping around Austin, I wound up driving down to San Marcos to see if I could find what I wanted at a good price. The Toyota Representatives were friendly, knowledgeable and courteous. ",5.0
23,"July 10, 2019","We came in on a Monday ready to close the deal. The person we dealt with clearly was not a salesman, even though it stated he was on his shirt and business card. He gave us the dealerships so called “best” offer, which I might add was the only offer or number that was ever spoken out of his lying mouth. He then stated another dealership in town had put in that exact same offer. We kindly said no thank you, that will not work for us. He didn’t say one word to us and let us walk out the door. No counter offer, no let me talk to the boss, nothin was said after that. San Marcos Toyota stated they sale vehicles to other dealerships versus consumers. Less than 24 hrs later they dropped the price of the vehicle by almost $1,000.00. Clearly San Marcos Toyota bold face lied to us. They never had an agreement with a different dealership evidently or why would the drop the price of a vehicle that had been setting on their lot 81+ days! Good business usually doesn’t start out with lies. 

We were very interested in a certain vehicle which it why we were persistent and drove the 4hr drive again to the dealership today to close the deal with a different sales associate. We were told our vehicle would be “completely detailed” and that’s a direct quote! Our purchased vehicle was ran through the wash with oil slapped on the tires. The inside wasn’t even touched! The sticker glue is still on the windshield and side window. Maybe San Marcos Toyota has different standards than the rest of the world. We actually are business owners and have never and will never treat our clients this way. Our 1st experience here was horrible customer service and our 2nd wasn’t much better. We spent over 4+ hrs in this dealership so we think this is a fair review of our experience here. If you are looking to be treated fair, kind, and a valued customer I would not recommend San Marcos Toyota.  If sales are down San Marcos Toyota please consider this constructive feedback",1.8

26,"July 05, 2019",We met Manny and discussed the purchase of a new Avalon. Manny was very knowledgeable of the cars and he didn’t have a high pressure sales attitude.  We had a great pleasurable experience.  The dealership was clean bright and everyone was a pleasure to work with. ,5.0

32,"June 20, 2019","They are always great. The service advisors are attentive and maintain communication. The only thing I would ask is that if you see a customer standing around and you work there, ask if they’ve been helped. I was standing around for about 10 minutes and not one person asked. The service was great but the cashiers were just looking at me stand there when I went to pick up my vehicle. This is the reason for 4 starts and not 5. ",4.4

38,"June 07, 2019","1. The customer service is hot and cold. Half the employees I interacted with were professional and pleasant, and half were terribly unprofessional, and obviously didnt want to help you or be at work. 
2. The radio, and USB ports beneath it in the bottom console, went out 2 weeks after I bought the Camry. I took it in to diagnose and fix. They assure me it's just a bad radio. I say what about the charging ports,  isnt it possibly something else, and that has caused radio and ports to stop working. They're confident it's just a bad radio. So they replace it. 
3. I pick the car up after work. It's late so I just trust it's all good. Bc they said everything's working and its fixed. I drive off lot, 2 mins later try to turn on the radio, IT DOESNT WORK. 
4. I Immediately called the service manager that I was working with, he doesnt answer.
5. Next day he hasnt returned my call, I wait until lunch time, and finally call back 3 more times before I can get someone to assist. 
6. Take the car back to them that day, and they have no clue what the issue is. I explain I'm leaving on a road trip in two days, and now wont have a working radio. Great.
7. The 2nd service manager, while less pleasant in person than the first, did try to help after I told him I'm traveling soon and am frustrated with this whole situation; so he offered me a rental to take on my trip, and they could keep my car and rediagnose issue and get it fixed while I was gone. Unfortunately he said I could only have it 5 days, and my trip was 7 days. Seems asinine not to extend it two days, so your customer who just bought a car 7 weeks ago isnt inconvenieced again. I've been to the service dept 3 times in 12 days. 
Fed up.

75,"April 26, 2019","Took 2018 Tacoma in for warranty repair on 4/15/19.  Cab was leaking on driver’s side with water pooling under carpet/mat.  Issue was occurring for quite sometime before it was discovered.  A moldy/musty smell inside the cab started to occur resulting in discovery of the wet carpet and mat since weather tech floor mats were installed in the truck at purchase.  Service first called on 4/16/19 and said it was the windshield after testing.  On 4/17/19 service called back to say it was leaking under the cowling and not the windshield.  Service called back on 4/18/19 to inform me that the rubber grommet around the wiring harness on the firewall was ripped and that’s where the leak was coming from.  Service stated that the wiring harness would have to be replaced in order to replace the grommet.  Service stated this would not be covered under warranty since three extra wires for auxiliary lights had been pushed through the grommet causing the rip.  I explained that one of the wires had been installed by them when they added auxiliary lights to the hood hinges when the truck was new.  I also explained that the other two wires were installed through the same hole they made.  Service advisor claimed that I must have ripped it.  I told them to stop work on the truck, that I would be there the next morning and that I wanted to see this leak in the grommet.  I had already look at and inspected this area for the leak before taking it to the dealer.  4/19/19 while at the dealer Iasked to see proof of the leak at the grommet.  Advisor brings out the mechanic that supposedly did the testing.  He stated they put a water hose running under the cowling and let it run for 10-15 minutes and that he sprayed the grommet with a squirt bottle.  Upon inspection there was no water where the three wires went through the grommet however there was water in the molded opening where the wiring harness goes through the firewall.  I asked them to reenact the test.  The advisor went and pulled a tech out of the body shop and they retested with the hose.  I videotaped the retest no leak was occurring at the grommet.  I also explained that under normal vehicle function I don’t drive down the highway with my hood up which would be the only way water would get to that grommet as test with the squirt bottle.  During this time all three of them discovered collectively that the leak was occurring on a seam at the very corner of the drivers side firewall and fender well.  They would have to pull fender / inner fender well to get to the seam.  I videotaped and inspected the inside cab firewall and found no leak at the grommet or around it,  none of the wiring was wet from a leak, the carpet pad up against the grommet and harness was dry as well.  The leak was continueing and following the same path Ihad described when the vehicle was brought in, which was along the drivers door kick plate.  At this point had this new discovery of the actual location of the leak not been found, observed, recorded, I would have owed San Marcos Toyota $231 & change for diagnoses and $105 a Day times 5 plus tax before the repair had even started.  I left the truck there with new vindication that the repair for the leaking cab and the removal of the moldy/musty smell would be resolved.  Approximately 4 hours later the service advisor called to say the truck was fixed and ready to go.  I explained this late in the afternoon that I would have to pick it up the next morning.   Picked up the truck on the morning of 4/20/19.  Upon inspecting the vehicle and receiving explanation of the repair, rubberized undercoating had been sprayed on the inner fender well, that’s it.  Inside the cab still had the moldy/musty smell,  the kick plate and side plate were in the back seat.  I lifted the carpet and under pad, both were soaked with water from the day before.  I asked for an explanation and the advisor said that they left the kick plates the way they were when the vehicle was brought in.  I stated that out of courtesy they could have been reinstalled.  I asked for an explanation for the wet carpet and pad and before he could say anything I stated that it was dry when I brought it in.  He just gave me an explanation that he worked in the detailing business and that I just needed to shut the windows turn on the vehicle and turn the heater on high for a couple of hours “that’s what he did when he was in detailing.”  I asked about replacing the moldy carpet and pad and he said it was above him.  This dealership it absolutely the worst and most shoddy “make something up, blame it on the customer, make some money, say it’s not warranty” I’ve ever seen, heard of or have ever been too.  I will not ever purchase a vehicle from here ever again.  I will however write a comprehensive and detailed statement over this and two other previous issues with this dealer.  Yes, this is not the first time down this road with this dealer, hence the videos.  It’s a shame you can’t give negative stars for a rating.",1.0
76,"April 26, 2019"," I started looking for a car in early March, after selling my last car. I kind of had my heart set on a 4runner, so on my way home from work, I stopped by to see what their pre-owned selection was like, and to start getting a feel for exactly what I was looking for in a 4runner. I was met with a smile by Big Mike. I let him know that I was not able to buy a car that day, but I wanted to see what they had because I needed a car soon. He was kind and enthusiastic as he showed me what they had in my price range. We went for a drive so I could get a feel for a newer one (we already have a 2002). He answered all of my questions and provided me with his card if I had anymore questions. Life for busy for a month and half, and I put the car search on hold. But Big Mike would periodically text to check in on how the search was going and to ask if he could do anything or help me with anything. Unlike other people I’ve dealt with who work at a dealership, he was far from pushy. He didn’t badger me, just a kind reminder that he was there to help when I was ready to start looking again. Easter weekend I was finally ready, and Big Mike helped me pick out exactly what I wanted. He found a car that was under my budget, and because of that, I was able to replace all the cloth seats with leather seats. So far, I am more than happy with the purchase, and the help and patience that I got from him. 

The truth is, many places sell pre-owned 4runners. And while they do sell fast, the main reason I came back to San Marcos Toyota to see Big Mike was not because of something I saw on their lot, but because they are so kind and patient didn’t just treat me like a number. I never felt pressured into my purchase. They did not use high pressure sell tactics just to get a sale. They listened to what I needed and basically let me call most of the shots. All my questions were answered, I got advice that I asked for, and I felt supported in my purchase. 

Best car buying experience by far!",5.0

Cowen in finance helped tremendously with Corolla purchase along with Paul and Craig also used car sales manager. We purchased last part of February. Came back 3 weeks later and traded our Tacoma in on a Tundra. How we made second purchase was calling Charles and asking him if he could ask Cowen was it possible to trade Tacoma in and to ask Cowen did he think it was possible to get same deal as Corolla. Charles after speaking with Cowen said come to San Marcos Toyota, we arrived at dealership and Charles was showing us 3 trucks we requested to look at 1 was a Tundra with TSS package and 2 Tacoma pickups different colors after test driving Tundra really no need in test driving Tacoma’s we really liked the Tundra. Cowen said take Truck home he would be ready by noon with response to financing. He called Monday like he said he stated financed through Toyota like Corolla but this time he outdid the financing job interest rate was amazing on Corolla when he told me rate on Tundra was to hard to believe he nocked it out of the park we are very happy with San Marcos Toyota Cowen and all of management and salesman Charles ",5.0

Mike was thorough, helped us explore all of our options (down payments, trade-ins, financing, etc.), and even made sure we could get the vehicle that day!  

Since our purchase, Mike has followed up with us to make sure our vehicle is everything we hoped for and to offer anything else we may need.  If you are looking for a vehicle, whether new or preowned, hands down, go to San Marcos Toyota and ask for Mike Hickey.  He will treat you with first class service, which can sometimes be hard to find these days.  There was no pressure to purchase and in fact, his positive attitude (no pushiness!), knowledge about the brand, and enthusiasm about US getting a new vehicle were all selling points.

99,"January 03, 2019","We recently purchased a used vehicle from this  dealership. Not only was it a painstakingly long process, to which they did not demonstrate ANY sense of urgency in the matter and only apologized for dragging the process out after our 4th time of asking how much longer it would take, but we feel that this dealership does not value the safety of their customers at all. 

We test drove the vehicle and noticed that the brakes felt a little tight, but because each vehicle is different we thought it was just a matter of it being a different vehicle.

I brought the vehicle in for a brake test after having it for only 3 days and it not feeling right. 
The service manager at the shop I brought it into informed us that the brake booster was going out and that if it goes out, the vehicle will not stop and this can absolutely result in injury or death. He went as far as to tell us that he could not in good conscience have us drive the vehicle out from that shop because they would be liable if anything went wrong and that if we declined the repair we would need to have it towed. 
We of course agreed to do the repair as this is a major safety concern, and have now after only 3 days of ownership of the vehicle have a $1,000 bill added.

This means one of two things at Toyota of San Marcos:

One, they don't do a full inspection of the vehicles on their lots to ensure that they are safe.  Regardless of their no warranty, or as-is condition, this vehicle in the condition that it  was in shouldn't have even been able to be test driven off the lot.

Two, they don't care about the safety of their customers once the car is off their lot because what matters to them is the sale. 
A follow-up call was made from a salesman there because they were unaware that we had even purchased a vehicle from them, and even after explaining that we were unsatisfied with the purchase, we were told we'd get a call back and considering the severity of the issue with the vehicle, no callback was made. 

This speaks volumes to the values at this dealership and we will never recommend this dealership to anyone, nor repeat business with them again. 

Shame on them for selling a vehicle that they neither looked into fully or did and didn't care once the sale was made!

After a short time he came back and told me that the tire man and himself could not find any defective area on the tire.  The problem was consistent with hitting a curb or something along the road.

103,"October 07, 2016","DO Not Work here! Worst pay plan in my 25 year history of Automobile sales. My pre interview I was given a pay % that were not true. I was then instructed to take a urinalysis and upon completion I was then given the company packet with pay plan. The first used vehicle I sold, I was given an amount my commission would be, because I did an excellent job of selling the company value. I was later told that there was a  repair order done a month prior that hadn't been posted yet, so then I received $100 mini. 
I sold 4 vehicles my first four days there 5 in 10 days. One had been on the lot 149 days and I had a flat tire on my way to work so Wham $50.00 mini. Oh did I mention the people that bought the first vehicle from me got bumped in finance because another customer who had been there an hour shorter was financing the vehicle and mine was a cash customer.
While I was there, a younger salesmen was told that he can only be paid a certain amount because they payed him hourly and he hadn't clocked in. He stated nobody showed him how to clock in. This happened to myself and another senior salesman, who was short on his ridiculous pay. The hours are long and arduous, yet you still don't get paid the correct amount, because they conspired to not tell new people how to clock in  It is almost criminal.

 I had to quit because I'm diabetic and I was driving 90 - 100 minutes a day each way, by the end of the day, I'd be suffering from dehydration and it caused kidney issues. I stayed longer because the sales manager Kyle and my manager Bill Brown kept saying things will get better. I do feel that their hands are tied when it comes to treatment of employees. The used car managers are new and often put far less than fair market value in vehicles because they're afraid of making a mistake causing customers to flee and go to other places.

As far as the service department, they have rude service writers and 1 real good older guy and a young guy that do their best to maintain customer  satisfaction. 
The final straw was yesterday when I went to pick up my final check as they said ""your final check is here"" I drove 105 miles only to find out my final check was not there it would not be ready until the 10th.
 I was not aware that every single deal advertise on the internet would be $100 and no bonuses are paid on used cars. During a meeting it was mentioned no salesman and qualified for a bonus in 4 months.  

 San Marcos customers, if it appears your salesman may be a little short with you, it is not their fault, nor is it the fault of the sales manager or employees, it is just the culture of that dealership itself. You can change managers all you want. You can put false reviews on the internet but you never change the culture of the place and that sucks for the people of San Marcos and its surrounding areas.

105,"July 02, 2016","I had a very positive experience with San Marcos Toyota in buying a new 2016 Rav4.  Karlton Kopecky, my sales person, was very helpful.  I made several internet requests to Toyota dealers in major Texas city metro areas for their best prices on similar Rav4s.  These dealers did provide this information to me either by email messages or telephone calls.  Karlton gave me a initial quote that I thought was still above what I wanted to spend.  On his own initiative, Karlton sent me an follow-up email message which brought the Rav4 down to what I wanted to pay.  Before making the purchase, I (1) had my financing pre-arranged with a credit union; (2) found an extended warranty from another company other than Toyota to cover the vehicle for several years; (3) did not have a trade-in; (4) told Karlton that I was not going to pay for some add-on items by the dealership that were listed below the MSRP sticker that some dealers were providing at no cost, and (4) a definite drive out price before I even went to the dealership.  Something that it also very important to me is the fact that San Marcos Toyota is an A+ Accredited Business with the Central Texas Better Business Bureau (BBB).  I made an appointment with Karlton as to when I would come to the dealership to purchase the vehicle.  With all of these pre-arrangements, the entire experience went well for me.

109,"August 08, 2015","I went into the dealership to look at some new cars. I was approached by the sale person, Manny, which seemed to be bothered that he had to get out onto the lot. I told him that I was looking at the 2015 Corollas so he took me to look at them and then took me for a test drive. During the test drive, he was very quiet and not telling me anything about the car. I had to ask him questions for him to say anything. When I did ask him questions, he seem a little lost so I let it pass. I completed the test drive and started talking numbers. I told him that when I had went to another dealership, that they told me that they would give me a certain amount for my car and he stated that I should had got it in writing with a rude tone. I told him that that is what I wanted and he told me that he did not know if that would be possible. He went on and asked me what it would take to get me into the car and I told him the right numbers before we can talk about buying the car. He told me that he was talking numbers so I told to go and see what is the best they could give me for my car. He came back with a low ball number and I told him the amount I wanted and nothing less. He went back and got what I wanted so he went and told the finance person to start the paperwork. When he came back, he stated that I should come back tomorrow and get my things out of the old car. He stated that because they were about to close. When he went to check with the finance person, I told another salesperson to tell Manny that the deal was off. 

So, I decided to give the dealership a second chance. I went in for an oil change and started looking at cars again. This time Sam came to help me. Sam was professional and very knowledgeable. Everything he told me, he made it happen. We went on a test drive and he was telling me about different features. He got me a good trade in amount and he made sure I was happy. He stayed after hours to take care of the deal. When I was waiting for the finance person, Sam was going over the warranty info when the finance person came in and told Sam that he better hurry up and get me to sign before I walk out on him again. I was real close to walking out again because of this moron statement but I stuck it out. 

I will probably never again buy from this dealership because of their lack of professionalism. Whenever I decide to buy another car, I hope to get Sam again but with some other dealership. I really hope this never happen to anyone else. ",4.3

  We found what we/I wanted and went to San Marcos, Toyota as that is where we bought the 2002,I had all maintenance and any repairs done there as well. So,we trusted them. If we walked in the door and felt rushed,or pushed we have no problem walking out.

    They did ask if they could try and beat the financing that the bank offered and we said sure. They did and we are happy with our purchase.

117,"March 05, 2012","San Marcos Toyota is the poster boy for all the reasons that people avoid dealerships. They are shamefully dishonest and absolutely out to rip you off. I'm a ""car guy"" and have been to them twice in the past 8 years for service items that only a dealer can perform. I was completely disgusted both times by their tactics of lying about what's broken, lying about what it costs, and as a bonus, just being completely rude. 
The real kicker is their tactic of presenting you with a list (unrequested) of ALL THE THINGS THAT MUST BE FIXED ON YOUR CAR. The list will total thousands of dollars. Of course, they say, some are more urgent than others, so let's prioritize the tasks and take care of them on several visits.
I can only imagine how they prey on people that are not ""car guys"" like your grandmother or maybe your daughter who attends Texas State. 
I am confident that this is endemic in the dealership, as both instances were years apart and with different personnel. The owner of San Marcos Toyorts should be ashamed of himself for creating and allowing this pit of snakes to prey on the public.

118,"October 11, 2008","Shopping for a car is not the easiest thing to do. In fact I have to say I just dislike the whole process. About 3 weeks ago we decided we should get a new car as our old trusted Camry (11 year’s old over 200,000 miles) was on its last legs. My Wife and I had spent 2 weeks shopping at stores (on Sundays when they were closed) and online at home. We had narrowed our search down to a Corolla or a Matrix. 
Down to the last few steps we were ready make contact with a real person. We had sent for quotes to 8 dealers. We got six responses, two had no quote and were blatantly automated emails with the usual sales pitch call us stuff (Hot Air). The other four had a detailed quote and the best two were the quickest and best presented. We chose these as our top two dealers as there quotes were both reasonable and believable!

The Phone Call! The phone was answered quickly and I could tell this guy was not a native Texan (no offence). I told him we would like to come and test drive both a Matrix and a Corolla. “No problem” he said, “I will have them ready for you when you get here”. That he did, He was very good with his presentation which gave me the impression that he really knew what he was talking about even making sure my wife understood what he was talking about. Then asked him for a price quote (We never told him we had shopped him on line we were just trying to compare the virtual world to the reality).
We went inside and sat on the showroom floor, and not stuck in an office somewhere. Offered a cup of Joe (not the best but drinkable) and he arrived back with a Price quote on the Corolla we picked. It was readable and typed up, and a sample payment chart. The price was very similar to the quote we got online, and seemed to have more rebate than when we first looked.
Then he said he would give us a few minutes to look over the numbers and left us alone. He seemed confident we would buy. When he returned he had a folder in his hand and asked how we would like to pay for the car. Mentioning that we can assist in Financing or we accept cash, personal checks, of our own Banks Financing (which we had an open draft in our pocket). 
We accepted his price, and he started to get everything ready for us to go and sign the papers, He did suggest that we give the Business Manager an opportunity to see if Toyota could get us some competitive financing suggesting we could keep a line of credit with our bank for emergencies. My wife thought this would be worth a try as we are planning to re model our kitchen in spring.
We finally got to meet with the Business Manager her name was Patsy, very nice and explained everything in detail. We may have taken up to much time by reading everything, she never rushed us. In the end we got a slightly better rate from Toyota even got an extra $400 as a college Grad Rebate. Even though I am 58 the Sales person still asked me if I had graduated college in the last 2 years, said he always likes to ask as he can't tell by looking. I had just completed my PhD which qualified me.
We finally finished the deal in just about 2 hour’s, We were ready to leave which we felt was perfect amount of time as we asked lots of questions.
Andrew took us to our car which was clean and full of gas. Before we left he did a quick summary of the controls making sure that we could use them. He did mention to us that we were welcome back for our first oil change on the Dealership, pointing to the express lube. Just before we drove of he had us look around the car, we noticed a tiny scratch. Andrew Confidently took control and took care of the issue. He let us drive another car to go get something to eat. When we came back it look liked it was never there. We were very happy at the passion and effort he took to solve the issue he even brought the Customer Relations Manager to meet us.
Over all we felt that we ""May"" have got $100 or $200 more better deal at another Toyota Dealership. We never purchase at the first place we visit, but I did not think that would have been a good investment of my time. Andrew had mentioned he has been at that dealership since 2003 this was assuring me he would be there after the sale if I had a question. I would have no problem sending him my friends and family to him. He was the exception to the rule or maybe it is that the type of salesperson these days are better equipped to be more customer orientated.
