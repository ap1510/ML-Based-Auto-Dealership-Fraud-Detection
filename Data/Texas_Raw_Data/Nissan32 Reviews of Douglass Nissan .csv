3,"February 15, 2019","We've been battling with this dealership for about eight months now. They are sending our bills to a different address in another town. How can they get paperwork that we filled out and mess it up that bad. This is a privacy issue and a definite inconvenience. We have tried to get them to correct their errors but only get lies assuring us it will be fixed. We have reported them to the Better Business Bureau, still not corrected. An attorney is next on or list. Buying a vehicle from them has turned into a nightmare. ",1.0
4,"January 30, 2019","I had to take my car in for a repair on Monday, January 14, 2019. Matt Gomez was very helpful in getting me taken care of in a timely manner. I was very satisfied with the work and the service. He explained everything to me and kept me updated with everything that was going on. I waited for a survey to come to my email and didn't receive one so I decided to come write a review. I felt the need to let everyone know how awesome he was. Thank you so much Matt Gomez.

5,"January 19, 2019","We live about 90 miles from dealership, called to see if a certain Murano that showed on Internet was still in stock.  Upon arriving, it was up front and available for test drive.  Discussed with salesperson, received fair purchase price with trade in, rebates, and dealer discount,  We went to lunch while they vehicle was in make-ready,  Pick it up and drove home.  All quick, efficient, and professional.   ",5.0
6,"January 18, 2019","The dealership is friendly, helpful, knowledgeable, and will work with you on a reasonable price. John was patient and definitely kept in touch as I was making a decision on my purchase. They were able to find the vehicle I wanted. ",4.8
7,"January 08, 2019","Took my daughter""s car in last week.  There was a recall on the airbags.  Was told it would take an hour and a half per airbag.  Made an appointment and took it in at 8:00 am.  Picked the car up at 4:30ish (way longer than 3 hours).  The steering wheel was crooked, which my daughter did not like.  So called to ask about fixing it. They said sure it can be fixed but we do not take the steering wheel off to do the airbag recall repair.  Made an appointment.  Took the car in at 7:30 am.  Told them that we needed the car by noon so my daughter could make it to an appointment in another town.  They said sure no problem. Went to get the car at 12:30 and it had not even been looked at.  Today was a total waste of time and gas.  Took the car and left.  They asked when we would be bringing the car back and my reply was ""We won't be"".  Appointments should be honored. It should not matter if it is a recall or a patron pay job.  I have been extremely disappointed in Nissan every time we have needed to have them fix a problem with the car.  Toyota NEVER treated me like this.  If you are not able to keep a reasonable schedule, do NOT make appointments. 1.8.2019",1.0

10,"September 24, 2018","I have bought several cars at Douglass Nissan. I have always been given what I think are the best deals and have been treated with respect. Being an “older” widow, I sometimes worry that I could be taken advantage of. But not at Douglass Nissan. They always treat with the utmost respect and I really feel like they have my best interest at heart. ",5.0

20,"November 07, 2017","Dominic Preston is the greatest salesman, showed us every thing we wanted to see and nothing we didn't. 
Made sure we knew how to operate our vehicle before leaving.  We literally were in and out in less than four hours and came out with what we wanted for the price and terms we wanted.  We cannot say enough good about our experience.  Will definitely be a return buyer when that time comes.",5.0

23,"June 27, 2017",I found a slightly used 2016 Genesis on line at Douglass Nissan.  I was contacted by a very pleasant sales manager Dane Goddard.  I expressed my concern about purchasing a vehicle sight unseen. He went out of his way to assure me that the car was like new.  Dane sent me a video walking around the entire car inside and out.  He gave me an equitable price and filled the tank with gas.  The car was shipped to me just northwest of Chicago.  It arrived clean and in excellent condition.  Dane Goddard called me several times and sent several emails in order to get the sale done.   I could not have had a better experience!,5.0

29,"January 06, 2014","I bought a used Nissan Sentra from this dealership and the process was very smooth.. Jimmy even brought the car to my home for a test drive as I didn't have any means to goto the dealership.. The whole deal took a few hours to complete and the dealership was very accommodating.. After I bought the car, they even helped me complete my insurance and loan formalities (even though I didn't take the loan from the dealership).. It was a very pleasant experience.. I would highly recommend this dealership.. ",4.5
30,"April 28, 2013","Purchased 2013 Nissan Pathfinder Platinum Premium package.Being from Louisiana I had to relay to what Mr Adam Dunker Business Manager @ DN would tell me trough the e mail exchange's. Never meat the person nor ever been doing business before with this dealership.Mr Adam was answering all my questions in written and without hesitation. Once I made my offer which was aprox. $1500 USD lower than asking price professional reply with acceptance came back without trying to get more money. I asked for invoice . Same was received within an hour. There was no hidden fee's and or charges.Made my deposit and actually paid 50% by MWT. Remember I haven't see the vehicle as yet.
Arrived at dealership next day and was treated with courtesy. It was this Saturday April 27th 2013. I questioned about the recall. Mr Adam checked the history and found out that one of the recalls would be due. He called parts manager who was already at home and asked him to come back to provide the part needed. Needless to say , manager came and vehicle was ready within two hours. While waiting I was provide with courtesy driver and vehicle who took me to the nearby restaurant. When I came back car was ready. I drove back home some 465 miles and had no problem's. This is what car sales business used to be all about . Strait forward,honest and open without tricks  and hidden fee's and false advertisements.  I say BRAVO for Douglass Nissan and Mr Adam along with THANK YOU.

31,"December 10, 2009","This dealership was happy to service my 300ZX turbo after an accident. They made the experience as painless as possible and explained in detail the work to be done, as well as the detailed results of the final alignment. The sales and service staff always greet me with a happy hello, and ask me how I've been. It really makes you feel like you belong to a family. I would recommend this dealer to anyone!",4.6
