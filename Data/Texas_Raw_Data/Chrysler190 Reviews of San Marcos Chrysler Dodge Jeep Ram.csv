0,"June 21, 2020","Terribly disappointed in my experience at San Marcos Chrysler/Dodge/Jeep.. First time ever buying a used vehicle, and the dealership refused to honor the advertised price online. Once I agreed to the price as advertised online (on several websites), test drove the vechicle, paid a mechanic to look it and was literally returning to the dealership to purchase the vechicle I was informed that there was a $2,396 addendum to the vechicle price. I was informed by the used car sales manager that this addendum is added to the cost of all used vehicles at this dealership. The addendum included such things as window tinting, paint protection plan,  nitro added to the tires and VIN etching. I informed the used car sales manager that I was never told about the addendum (the sales associate confirmed he never disclosed it to me until 10 minutes before I returned to the lot) and I told the used car sales manager that I did not want these services. I was happy to waive them and purchase the vechicle as originally planned. He informed me that these items and costs were already performed and built into their price on the vechicle but not included in the online price. I informed him that the windows on the vechicle were not even to tinted to which he offered to have them tinted in the future but that he would not/could not waive the cost. I then informed him that I would waive any possible claim under the paint protection plan, he said that too was included in the price of the vechicle. When I asked to see the terms of the paint protection plan I was informed that there are no written details/contract, but rather I should
just come back to the dealership if there was an issue in the future. When I asked for proof that I was purchasing the paint protection plan I was informed there was no paperwork available to verify that either. 

I ended up purchasing the vechicle because I had already invested time and money (mechanic review) into the vechicle, but It was an absolutely horrible experience. You may expect this type of treatment and dishonest advertising and dealing from a typical used car lot but I expect a much higher degree of professionalism and experience at a franchise dealership. I believe the manufacturer should review the practices of this dealership before renewing or expanding their franchise.

I also asked the used car sales manager for an opportunity to visit with the general manager only to be informed that he was unavailable and that they would not try and contact him.

Terribly disappointed in San Marcos Chrysler/Dodge/Jeep.",1.0
1,"June 19, 2020","Service advisor, Rolando, gave me critical information to get my vehicle started and back in motion. He then was instrumental in getting the vehicle fixed and placed us in a loaner car for the duration. ",5.0

3,"June 16, 2020","Took 2005 Jeep in for their experienced technicians to diagnose why the check engine light was on. After weeks of evidently repeated miss diagnosis and replacing parts that put a severe strain on the pocket book, we had picked it back up again with the assurance again that it was repaired. The next day the light came back on (a Friday). Took it back in. Tuesday we call to get an update to hear that they want another $3800. The code says to replace the catalytic converter and they think the exhaust manifold has a crack. ENOUGH!!! Have we been continually charged for parts because they were unable to read the code(s) correctly? My husband is retired and I work for Amazon. I am going in for surgery on my left knee. No way could we come up with that money and my confidence in their technicians is nil. I am soooo exasperated and soooo upset. My husband has gone to pick up the Jeep without them doing these repairs. We could have found a much cheaper parts changer. ",1.0

Armando took care of our appraisal for our trade while we were on our test drive and we agreed on numbers within 15 min after the test drive. They had our Jeep cleaned up with a full tank of gas before we were out of the finance office so we were on our way right after signing the paperwork. Finance was great also. They were able to save us thousands by finding a bank that offered a better interest rate. All around a great place to buy a vehicle.,5.0

19,"May 19, 2020","Went to check out a used vehicle my son saw on the website and talked via phone to salesman.  Upon arrival, we saw they use a second ad-on sticker for $2,396 over the cost of the car.  The car had factory tint, yet they added 399. Paint protection is 699, and the chips were still there and scratches were clearly visible. VIN etching was 799 and nitrogen with road hazard protection was 499.  The vehicle was priced at 8999.00 on the web and second sticker raised it to 11,395  or 27% more. Then add the +150.00tax on the fake sticker items, I am required to use a person's name in the review. James Cruz is the Internet Manager, although we never spoke face to face he is in charge of the Internet ads and fails to mention a second sticker that increases to cost dramatically.",1.0

33,"April 09, 2020",Went in for a recall and oil change. I ran in to Mr X and told him I was interested in a Durango still. I told him what I want but they only had a few in stock. He sent me off for a test drive. In a GT plus. I then came back and he surprised me with a white RT with everything I wanted. I ended up getting the RT with a good deal. MR X is a great in sales and will surprise you. Great place to buy second car i have got from San Marcos dodge.

35,"April 02, 2020","Dealership has advertised price of $34299 and then on a USED truck adds a charge for tint $499. VIN etching $599, paint protection $599, and $399 for nitrogen in the tires. They are misleading on the advertised price adding all these overblown options that were probably already charged to the original buyer when the vehicle was new.  This is a SINGLE cab pickup and they charge $499 for tint you can get for $99! Do not let them screw you by forcing all these adds to your NEW vehicle much less a USED vehicle!",1.0

37,"March 27, 2020","Had my truck serviced at San Marco's dodge. They changed the oil,both fuel filters,air filter and rotated my tires. They did it in less than 2 hours. Plus washed it at no charge. When it was time to pay they gave me discounts that saved me alot of money. I highly recommend them. If you have a dodge diesel truck that's the place to go to have work done.",5.0

40,"March 18, 2020",I took my car in for oil change and a warranty work. I had a sensor go bad  on the rear folding seat and although I was only 16 miles from my 36000 warranty experation they were happy to make the repair. Stephanie was my service advisor and she pointed out that if I purchased some kind of oil change plan that included tire rotation I could same $60 per service.

52,"February 07, 2020","I usually have a good experience at san Marcos dodge  but this time is was horrible.  First they could not find my service contact, they lost my wheel lock from the last time i got my car service.  They check my tires stating it was at 6  .I asked them to recheck  my tires and it was at  2. I'm still waiting on a phone call from them to see if they found my service contact. I know the car wash is complementary but it was poorly completed.  ",2.0

56,"January 26, 2020","I can't praise Rolando and the service team for doing such a fantastic job helping me with my car.

62,"January 02, 2020","Nothing is scheduled according to when techs will actually be there. Wasted trip for no reason. Have to call them to confirm information they said they will contact you about. 

Missing Key on a brand new truck, could not find it.

Upsell maintenance plans with no notice that they offer 2 free oil changes in the first year until after you signed everything and are about to drive away.

When communicating with them they reply in rushed responses just to get you to come in... again for a wasted trip because no one is actually there to correct your (brand new!) vehicle.",1.2

65,"December 29, 2019","I walked in originally having done research for inventory next door. However once the staff realized this they informed me and gave me proper directions but also offered to help me with their current inventory list and any questions I had. Turned out I got a way better deal than I would have going next door or at any other dealership I had been to. Everyone was super friendly, their numbers and prices were straight forward, and so was the staff. I was not once at unease at any point in time during my visit. I am definitely going to recommend this dealer to anyone I know looking for a vehicle. My sales person Alejandro Dominguez was pleasant and informative. This is the place to go. I can not thank them enough. ",5.0
66,"December 24, 2019","Great service. I thought I’d be there longer seeing how many people were in the waiting room, but all went well & got a free wash. ",5.0
67,"December 22, 2019","I Made an appointment for 7am mainly because the car shakes while idling. I Waited 3 hours for Fred the service advisor to inform me that my left and right motor mounts are worn. Not to mention they knew the car had bad motor mounts but didn’t replace it because it wasn’t a ""safety issue"", which was never brought up when I bought the car. Furthermore he told me the car was too old to repair and the warranty doesn’t cover it, without verifying if my extended warranty covered it.  It'll be $800 to fix parts and labor. My fiancée and I went to the dealership before our flight to obtain my licenses plates and copy of the documents because I never received them in the mail secondly the temp tags expired on November 26th and we got pulled over on our way there. During our visit there I told the finance manager Colton Sterling about the motor mounts he said the vehicle is covered under warranty and to come back on Wednesday after our vacation to get it repaired. We returned to the dealership after our vacation and talked again with Colton. He made us wait for an estimate and to see if its covered or not from the service department for an hour. On top of that all he did was write down the parts and labor on a sticky note which was still $800 to fix with a phone number. He also informed me to call that number to see if its covered or not because they couldn't repair it due to a Christmas party the next day. In addition if it's covered I can get it fixed at any shop and they’ll take care of it. So I called the insurance company and they mentioned the vehicle being covered and that I had to only get it repaired at that dealership and to contact the service department. As a customer I don’t feel comfortable with this dealership repairing my vehicle after they’ve been giving me the run around for months. What I did like about this dealership was the outstanding customer service from the salesman David and the finance advisor Matt that I received when purchasing the vehicle but I'm disappointed about the service I've received  afterward. Not only I wasted multiple trips during my vacation to take care of the issue, I was given misleading information about my car being repaired under warranty or not. This issue could've been resolved with the 1st visit which will most likely be my last visit. I've notice the finance manager Colton Sterling values having a Christmas party the next day rather than taking care and retaining a customer. ",1.0

71,"November 25, 2019",There is only one reason I would ever consider recommending this dealership and that being the help I received from one service advisor who’s name I didn’t catch but extension was 241.

74,"November 18, 2019","Warning, San Marcos Ram service dept. demanded $135 diagnostic fee although repairs would occur following week as I needed to return when warranty insurance co. open. 

Per Terry Wagner, service mgr (advisor was Jonathan), he would rather lose me as customer to collect $ for no repair, rather than me return for repairs covered by extended warranty!

The sales team has some stand up knowledgeable folks on board. Highly recommend a purchase from them. 

However, do NOT finance through them. Their finance staff is shady and takes them forever before you actually realize they're never going to help you. Stick with USAA or Randolph if you're going to finance! ",4.8

82,"September 29, 2019","While the quality of service was fine, the work organization was very poor., and disorganized. I was there just for an oil change, and I was there waiting for 4.5 hours. I have been to other dealerships where the wait times is no longer than 1 hour, and this is for a dealership that has a heavy load of customers waiting on all varieties of car repairs. That is the excuse that this Dodge dealership used. This dealership did not have mechanics just dedicated to oil changes.  I was very unhappy with the wait time, and I doubt that I will use their services again.",3.0

My car always gets washed when done, even though it may not need it as I keep it very clean. This trip there was more work performed and it was a busy day. When the car was returned I was given a free oil change for my wait. When I got home I noticed oil on my car hood and a black greasy hand print where the hood had been closed. Somehow this was also missed when washed. My only reason for not giving you 5 stars.",4.4

88,"August 16, 2019","I recently visited on a Saturday morning after a check engine light came on my Jeep. I was met and greeted by Gilbert and he handled the entire process. He let me know there was a recall on my Jeep and they had the parts in stock. He also had a technician check the codes and ended up also needing a thermostat, also all parts in stock. I asked if the could also change oil and perform a State Inspection. Gilbert went above and beyond to get my vehicle in and started on immediately. Gilbert is the ideal Service Advisor and showed his professionalism off on my visit. I would have to say this was the best experience I ever received at ANY dealer.

111,"March 25, 2019","If you want to have a truly horrible experience trying to buy a car, I can highly recommend San Marcos Chrysler Dodge. 

I drove down from Austin and drove (the car) Saturday. (The sales guy) takes my info to the finance folks and comes back with a quote that's $4K -- FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS -- more than the advertised price (which was only $17K to start). He says something about needing to maintain the vehicles and fine print on the website then asks what it would take to make a deal. I give him an OTD number about $500 less than advertised price, which -- stupid me -- I assumed that was a real price used as a start of negotiating. Sales guy is gone long enough, and I can see him wandering around in the finance office, that I think he's going to come back with final paperwork. Instead, it's just the same piece of paper with some new numbers that include a sales price that's still TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS more than list on both CarGurus and your website. I told him that was not acceptable, got up and walked out.

I looked at the fine print on their website and it mentions the typical TT&L, a negotiable fee of up to $115 and ""documentation charges"". All of that was listed on sales guy's paper separate from the sales prices of $4K and $2K above the advertised price. So where did those numbers come from and how do they relate to the advertised price?

I was told earlier that the web price was the best price. Clearly, that was not true. I would not have wasted three hours, including driving down and back, if I had known this was how the dealership treats its customers

This is not how legit businesses do business -- and why so many people HATE the idea of buying a car.

Their website says, ""We treat you like family!""

I'm really glad I'm not related to them.",1.6

My husband and I took them to look at a couple of pickups in New Braunfels, but he didn't see what he wanted so we drove to San Marcos Dodge.  He found a pickup he liked that was equipped for his needs - towing package with trailer brakes and navigation. We spent several hours at the dealership getting the run around, so we were leaving and got sucked back in (biggest mistake was going back in).  Anyway, a deal was made, promises were made.  LONG story short they only had one set of keys for a new pickup (why I don't know) but they promised they would get them a new set, paperwork took forever, and they were told to take the pickup and come back on Monday and they would have the paperwork and the set of keys for the pickup.  Paperwork was completed on Monday; second set of keys were not available, and they were told to come back again to get the keys.  Of course, they had to go back home; so my father-in-law kept in contact with the one of the salesman and scheduled a time to come back and pick up the key.  It was January 2018 they drove back to San Marcos (5-hour trip) for the key and they told them they could not give it to them!  Needless to say, they spent over $500 for the second set of keys (remote) and $500 for them to hook up the trailer brakes that it was supposed to be equipped with.  They were told it was equipped with navigation, tow package w/trailer brakes - found out after the fact it had neither (just recently found out it had no trailer brakes when they tried pulling their camper.)  They had an all-around bad experience with San Marcos Dodge.  They were nice and friendly when trying to make the sale but after the fact you are nothing to them!!  No customer service whatsoever!

148,"August 06, 2018","Go to another dealership, not here. The service manager Terry and service advisor Erik were two individuals who made the process unbearable for the customer. 

I dropped off my vehicle (2015 Dodge Charger R/T Premium, all of the bells and whistles) on June 7 (morning) and picked up on June 22. Upon vehicle delivery, I worked with Erik and handed him a list of issues (backup camera intermittently going out along with video that I sent to the service manager, transmission stalls in shifting, brake noise where pads and drums are in great condition, front impact sensor going off at unnecessary times, mechanical odor from ac, software updates from service bulletins, etc.) as well as possible reasons for the issue. Erik told me that it will be seen within a couple of days and expect an update. Since I heard nothing, I called on June 9 a total of 4 times from the morning to the afternoon to finally receive a call from Erik to say that it will be June 11. On June 11, I received no calls or updates. June 12, I call and speak with the service manager Terry who says that he will handle, and I tell Terry that I do not want to work with Erik anymore. So, I receive an update from Erik who gives the smallest bits of info as I had to ask very specific questions to get any answers...part of which he does not have any answers because he has to ask the tech. I ask him why is he giving me updates if he does not know the info. No response from him. Anyway, I email Terry that I did not want to work with Erik, so he responds, ""I don’t let my advisors switch just because it gets hard."" I respond ""difficult for the advisor or the customer?"" which he never answers, and I asked him in person without a response as well. This is also working with warranty to cover the issues with no help from the dealership's service. Anyway, June 13-21 is a continuation of this cluster F situation.

On June 19, Erik (yes, still have to work with him) calls to let me know that my car is ready, gives me a total, then asks if I want my battery replaced because it is dead. So, I ask what do mean dead. He tells me when the warranty person that they had to jump start the car. On June 20, I call warranty and learn that there is no report from the warranty person. I contact the dealership where the service manager says that the warranty person saw the instrument panel go haywire, etc., and that he thought it was a done deal to get the car repaired. Erik is standing there with his thumb up his butt and not saying anything. One June 21, I purchase a battery and install it at the dealership to have the warranty person come back out and review the vehicle. Note: I did not bring any tools, and with no one to lend a small wrench, I had to go back home, get my tools, and install the battery...no thanks to anyone. I tell Erik possible issues if the battery died because it was starting up right away when I dropped it off. So, I go ahead and contact Dodge corporation and give them feedback on this dealership, and Dodge said that they document it and relay to the area manager that is not an employee of the dealership. I receive the info on the area manager and reach out to Joshual Avila who responds and says that he will see what he can do to resolve the matter.

On June 22, I go to the dealership because my vehicle is ready. Nothing was found to be wrong by the warranty person. I run into the service manager who thought all was fixed, and I said no. So, we go and speak with the technician. THIS IS WHAT I SHOULD HAVE DONE IN THE BEGINNING. The tech tells me all that he did and what he found, then he tells me about the warranty person. I learned why there is no report because the warranty person could not review the vehicle with a dead battery, meaning that Erik lied...actually he lied a number of times, part by omission by not answering my questions or too afraid to answer when he knew the answer. Then, Terry's claim of the instrument panel going haywire, was actually to another vehicle, not mine. Erik knew this and said nothing, but he was too stupid and inconsiderate towards the customer. The technician tells me that he had a previous mix up (same week) with another customer due to the service manager intervening with bad information. So, the service manager is also part of the issue.

After checkout with the cashier, I ask to speak with Joshual Avila who I had no idea was at the dealership during this last round of idiocracy. During my conversation with Joshual, he continually tells me sorry for what I think. I tell him, ""for what I think? This is what I experienced."" Then, he tells me that he can be my contact for future service needs...knowing that he had responded via email saying that my vehicle is ready and good to go...Really? Nothing good about the run around and bad treatment that I received. So, I tell him that I should have spent $3,000 more for a better vehicle and an all-around better service experience. Then, I told him that I am getting rid of the Dodge and buying a different make. He says that he is sorry to hear that and says that you have another Dodge vehicle that we can continue to service. I just looked at him and thought what an idiot because it is like he heard nothing of what I said and simply does not care for the customer and what they experience.

Well, I have handled part of the problem. After being a Dodge/Chrysler owner for 30 years, this experience was so bad that I gladly traded in both of my Dodge vehicles for other makes. Dodge, you can thank San Marcos Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram (SMCDJR) for this. I hope the owner of the dealership sees this review as I am sure that he will want to know about it as I have the dates and times of my calls and emails.

As I was calling around for cars, I spoke to San Marcos Nissan, and I asked if the service department was shared with Dodge or separate. The person told me that it is separate. I said good because I hated working with the SMCDJR service department, and the person tells me ""I don't blame you."" I was like nice...from your neighboring dealership.

I purchased a NISSAN with the truck trade, and I purchased a CADILLAC with the charger trade. I have owned another CADILLAC for over 3 years, and the service is what service is supposed to be...4 years/50K miles (from in-service date) bumper-to-bumper including maintenance on all models (7 years/100K miles on certified which I got). At CADILLAC, I drive up, the service advisor knows who I am (their system auto pulls my vehicle info and mine), gathers my concerns, responds while placing into the system, receive daily updates, technicians work indoors (climate controlled area)...to boot, they have complimentary CADILLAC loaner vehicles if I want one as they service my vehicle...remember, I was out of my vehicle for 16 days which was a major burden to me as I live in San Marcos and work in Austin, but did SMCDJR take that into consideration? Nope, they lost no sleep and simply could care less. If you have received bad service from SMCDJR with their crooked tactics of lying, placing the burden onto the customer to pressure into bad options, etc., I highly recommend writing a review to have them make changes on their front end service people as the technicians appear to be fulfilling their end but are receiving the shaft from the service advisor and service manager.

TAKE YOUR CAR TO ANOTHER DEALERSHIP FOR TRUE SERVICE WORK AS IT WILL BE WORTH THE HOUR DRIVE. IT TOOK 16 DAYS IN SERVICE TO GET MY BATTERY REPLACED...AND I AM THE ONE WHO REPLACED IT. BUT THEY HAD NO PROBLEM IN CHARGING ME A DIAGNOSTIC FEE.

TERRY WAGNER, why are wanting me to contact you? I do not want to hear anything unless you are willing to reimburse my costs as you cannot give me back the time that I wasted with your dealership. JOSHUAL AVILA, no need to speak to you because I have experienced your help which went nowhere. SMCJDR says that they are ""Hiring Winners""...for who? Well, not the customer.",1.0

He was honest in what options would best serve our family and budget.  In 25 years of buying, selling and trading vehicles; this is by far the BEST car buying experience we have ever experienced.  We had endless questions & inevitably consumed a large portion of his afternoon/evening trying to find the perfect fit for us.  However, he never made us feel rushed or as if we were inconveniencing him in any way.  His knowledge of the product he represents and markets was reassuring and impressive.  We will definitely be referring our friends and family to this dealership & to Mr. Robinson.  We also have every intention of being repeat customers to this establishment.

So many factors into the quality of service provided here that I can't list them all but will try.   I was greeted at my vehicle and was put in the system as soon as i got there.  Fealt welcomed and was instantly provided with options and information for serveral things I wanted to discuss about maintenance.  The waiting area is great.  I was given updates on status, and was comfortable with nice seating, coffee and doughnuts.

166,"June 12, 2017","So first off, I would say don't take your vehicle here to be serviced. Like others, I wish I would have read the reviews before taking my vehicle here.  There is obviously an issue with the way this place operates. The feeling I got from the folks at the front desk of the service department was, they get a lot of returning customers with complaints. A revolving door. I know that dealerships are more expensive but thought that the knowledge and experience with the maker of my vehicle would compensate for the price difference, I was wrong. 
 	 I brought my vehicle in for an issue I was having with vibration from the front driver's side wheel. I believed it was a bad wheel bearing. This was self-diagnosed, to the best of my abilities, through some research and knowing a little about automobile repair.  I knew that (for my vehicle) the front wheel bearings had to be pressed in, needing an expensive tool that I did not have.  As well, my horn was not working and I know little to nothing about electrical repairs. It specifically states on paperwork (CUSTOMER STATES HEARS A WHOOP WHOOP NOISE FROM LEFT FRONT AT SLOWER SPEED)
  	Three days after dropping my vehicle off I pay a $568 bill just to get in my vehicle and have the exact same issues going on.   Hearing the exact same noise from when I brought the vehicle in, I exit the highway and head back to the dealership, where I end up talking to Brian who gets in the vehicle with me for a drive and he tells me ""yes, it is your front driver side bearing that is bad but we replaced your rear driver side bearing because it was worse"" Ok? The paperwork I got states ""test drove after bearing replacement and notice CVT transmission noisy.” Obviously, no one test drove it afterward because it only took a matter of seconds for Brian to hear the bearing, also my horn was still not working. Brian's excuse was that the mechanic working on my vehicle was an ""older"" gentleman. This was at the close of business so I told Brian I would return the following day.  
I'm not the type of person to start a scene in a public place and gave Brian, Randall (who took my vehicle in), and Terry every chance to correct the situation.  All I was told, was to bring the vehicle back in to be fixed when I had time. No estimate, no discount, no sorry for wasting your time, just “bring your vehicle back in when you have time and we'll fix it”. I should have never gotten my vehicle back in this condition, with the same issues I brought it in with. It should have been fixed the first time. I would have gladly paid for both bearings to be replaced while it was already in the shop. That didn’t happen though. 
I ended up being referred, by a friend, to a locally-owned mom-and-pop automotive repair establishment (all “older” mechanics) where they were friendly, fixed my vehicle in two days (including the horn) and for less than it cost me for just one driver's side rear wheel bearing replacement from this dealership.  I’m currently deciding between either a Dodge or Chevy pickup, if I decide to go, Dodge, I'll have to make the trip to somewhere else to get it.

What is this sign a confidentiality agreement

Mr. Hilley,
Since seeing recent statements that you have posted on our Yelp account our general manager has requested that you sign a document stating that you will cease and desist any and all statements, written or otherwise, on any type of forum in regards to our dealership. Since we have gone to great lengths to try to repair the situation we feel that we need to protect our reputation as a business. This will be required before you will receive the check for the payment of repair for your vehicle.

Mr. Hilley,
Then unfortunately we will not be able to cut a check for the reapir costs of the vehicle. This is required by our dealership if you would like the $1,549.38 to repair the vehicle. I politely ask you to reconsider. We would like to settle this in a civil manner and this is what we have been advised to do.
