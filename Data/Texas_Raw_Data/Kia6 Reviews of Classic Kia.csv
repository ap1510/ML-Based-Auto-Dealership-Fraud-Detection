It was a very refreshing experience. He will be my only car sales man from now on and kia classic has my business for life!!",5.0
1,"March 22, 2020",I would not recommend classic kia to anyone I know . Be warned.  They pulled the ole switch-a-roo on me. And I was a repeat customer. I repeat- DO NOT BUY FROM THESE PEOPLE!!!!,1.0
2,"August 13, 2019","Both Frank and Josh were great Sales reps and helped us find the exact car we were looking for. We came all the way from Austin after dealing with several other dealers who were difficult to work with. It was 100% worth it! 

Frank stayed in contact frequently while our vehicle was being delivered to the dealership. Both he and Josh sent us pictures of our vehicle when it arrived. We made the drive and within just a few hours of test driving (Josh made sure to go over every feature) and discussing finance (there we no surprises at all), we were on the road home in our new car. 

My wife is incredibly happy with her new car and working with Classic Kia has been the best car buying experience we've had. Thanks Frank and Josh for treating us like family!",5.0

4,"June 12, 2019",Classic is the absolute BEST dealer in the entire southeast Texas area. They have always been good to me with each purchase made from both the sales and service department. I have done business with them for the past couple years and I plan to continue using them for any future purchases made. I recommend them to EVERY person that is in the market. The management is just incomparable with other dealers. They will get you the most unbeatable price and make sure you are happy with your purchase instead of rushing you into the decision. I hope everyone makes the decision to go see them so that they too can have the same experience.,5.0
