5,"June 16, 2020","Purchased a truck form this dealership. Had three diagnostic tests completed on the truck. One of the tests turned out to be a lie. Found out after purchase within 1000 miles but I drove from Austin to Maine with the truck so could not go back to complain. Broke down in Bristol Tennessee. Called the dealership 6 times, no return call or correspondence. Contacted Ford Corporate, they got through to the GM who stated he would call back in 15 minutes ( mind you this is A MONTH later ) No return call. When I call, they state they are transferring the call. It gets transferred, rings twice and then dial tone. Highly recommend going to another ford dealer. Classless customer service ",1.0

21,"May 16, 2020","I've hesitated to write this review but have now learned that not only are the dealership sales tactics untruthful but the service department charges for services promised but not performed.

Purchasing my 2019 F150 was agonizing, everything the sales person said was later changed or forgotten. Financing was based on lies and half truths. The service department promised a service for which I paid and had to pay for again at another dealer because Maxwell failed to provide the service as agreed.

I will not recommend Maxwell Ford to anyone and will do everything in my power to see to it that no one is a future customer.",1.4

Edgar was timely and prompt in his communication working through the details of the deal and transportation arrangements.

Edgar  did a great job for us in the process of purchasing our new vehicle. Highly recommend ",5.0
30,"May 05, 2020","I was excited to work with Maxwell Ford at first. However, once I bought my car it was nothing but problems. I bought a brand new 2019 Ford Edge and there were two big issues:

1. The tint on the drivers window was already bubbling (looked like it had little pieces of dirt under it) so they did fix that as agreed at purchase.. however, after it was fixed it was still there.. I asked the salesperson Josh, to get it fixed again, he said he would ask it they could and never got back with me. I texted a few times, and even went up there and asked about it. He said, ""let me find out"".. I heard nothing... it has now been 6 months and the issue has not been fixed and needs to be ASAP

2. There is a foggy spot between the glass panes on the passenger side windshield.. they are refusing to fix it as ""they do not handle glass issues""

Then there is the issue with Service:

I have created an appointment to get my oil changed with vale service, however every time I do they either say it will take several hours or cannot pick the care up via the valet service because they got slammed. When I asked about it I was told that an appointment doesn't actually guarantee a time or that your car will be worked on at that time. It is just a ""reminder"" or a time to actually have the car at the agency.. even though they never actually picked it up. 

I am severely disappointed with this dealership. Once you buy the car it is like you no longer exist.",1.8

33,"April 30, 2020","I went to do the research and test on a New Ford F150 Truck for my cousin's behalf. I was met at the door by Mayra C. She was so polite and professional from the beginning. She asked if I was working with any 1 and I replied no, & told her it was her lucky day. I was here to buy a truck. I had the stock numbers ready and she went to get the 3 I wanted. Excellent presentations on all 3. For me the important thing was knowing about the 3 different engine, driving and feeling them on the road. Mayra explained them to me and gave me her professional opinion while we went on the test drives. I liked how she had patients and didn't rush me on the test drives and gave me all the time in the world. I appreciate that in a sales person. Patients, knowledge of their product, and allowing time to make a informative decision. We finally selected the Silver F150 XLT V-8 engine with leather package and bed liner. The negation was quick and their sales manager was fair on the price and we felt satisfied with the process and deal we got. Called the cousins to come see their new truck and sign the papers. We got the right price for us plus the finance manager offered us great premium extended warranty and maintenance package that we felt happy & complete with pricing as well. Overall the experience was easy, non-pressured, and not what I expected. We are surprisingly happy with our new truck and thank you again Mayra C. for all you did to make My cousin Noelia & Marlon's first new Truck a reality. They deserve it and God put you in our path at the right moment. HAPPY, HAPPY, FORD TRUCK OWNERS!!!!! ",5.0

45,"April 08, 2020","We recently moved to Austin. We took our car to Maxwell for steering recall work. We were told it needed $1500 in additional work on the steering arms and they could not do the recall without also doing the additional work.  We called our old dealership in our previous state and asked if that was true.  Would the steering arms have to be replaced in order to do the recall?  Our old dealership told us that the recall could be done even if we chose not to have additional work done.  We took the car to a different dealership in Austin.  They did the recall work, inspected the steering arms, and said they did not see any additional problems with the car. I will not go back to Maxwell in the future.",1.0

51,"March 19, 2020",I was sold a vehicle that had a “30 point inspection” Guaranteed by the salesman Edgar and brought it home and the horn didn’t work. Took it to my local ford dealership and the horn is completely missing out of the vehicle and it’s not covered under warranty. It was also $140 just for them to diagnose it. A seat in the back row was ripped which is also not covered under warranty that this salesman did not seem to mention when we bought the vehicle as well. I have contacted them and have yet to hear back. I will be contacting the Better Business Bureau to let them know that this dealership sold me an illegal vehicle that wouldn’t pass inspection. ,1.0

68,"February 29, 2020","I bought a sweet 2018 Jeep Wrangler, really cool vehicle overall. It has an after market 3inch lift on 35s and rides great. My salesman Edgar Cruz was very helpful setting up an appointment time, having the vehicle ready upon my arrival, and great communication skills. The Jeep is equipped with a manual transmission, Edgar did a good job helping me polish up on my rusty shifting skills. Everyone was very nice and the process was quick and efficient. After purchasing the vehicle and driving it home on the free way I noticed it was out of alignment and had serious radio/sound system issues. I contacted the dealership and they immediately set up a time to have it properly serviced and fixed!

I expected the vehicle to be in tip top condition as described. Despite the issues, I am happy with Maxwell Fords ability to take initiative and fix the problems.

76,"February 25, 2020","After buying a 2014 truck from Maxwell Ford on a Tuesday and driving back 4.5 hours to Big Springs, then driving the truck 2 hours on Wednesday. The trucks steering components WENT OUT as we were driving down the road, (and their shop supposically did a safety inspection on the truck) I'm talking about the steering rod, tie rod, and stabilizer shocks WERE ALL SHOT TO CRAP.  After reaching a representative of Maxwell Ford, we were told that they would only cover 1/2 the repair cost. They did however, finally agree to pay the full price. But the shop we had to have our truck repaired at was just a mechanical shop and didn't do alignments. I contacted our salesman about where to take the truck for the alignment since this was a result of the steering repair issue, only to be told....

96,"January 31, 2020","I have been searching on line for a used car for several weeks and in the process came across so many dealerships that would not stop calling and nagging me because of the on line search. 
Then I found Maxwell Ford and the best part of that was also finding Edgar. He was very knowledgeable, honest, non pushy and helpful. I have not purchased the car yet, It's been 3 days since my test drive. Working on personal, finanical  snags.  I have reached out to him for a few answers and Edgar has been so polite in helping even though I have not started any purchase process with him. 
Anyone shopping for a used car needs Edgar.

97,"January 29, 2020","Well I’d emailed with Edgar several days before coming in to test drive a 2014 Jeep Wrangler. He was very quick to respond and answer my questions (of which I had many since this was my first car purchase!) I come in for a test drive, and he brings the Jeep right out, and I fell in love. With the Jeep (sorry, Edgar). My friend was meeting me there, and she got lost in the parking lot, so Edgar got out of the car we were getting ready to test drive and found her on the wrong side of the dealership. Another example of Edgar’s greatness. We went on a fun little test drive around the neighborhoods near the dealership, since it was rush hour. After our little cruise, we go inside, and we haggle a bit over the price of the Jeep and the value of my trade in. We made a lot of demands, and Edgar really did try his hardest to get us what we asked for. We didn’t get as low as we wanted, BUT NOT TO WORRY - Edgar supplied us with Nutty Buddy’s, in addition to washing and filling up the Jeep. What a guy! 10/10, highly recommend. Friendly tip: bring an exotic fish to your negotiation with Edgar. Just trust me. 
Then Edgar ditched us (rude) so we could finish the paperwork with Andy in the back. Andy was very efficient and explained everything perfectly. And did I mention he’s British?

99,"January 16, 2020","I noticed a truck online which they had and went to the dealer to purchase. I test drove the vehicle and then we proceeded to talk price which was 2000 dollars over the advertised price. They were willing to sell the vehicle at 1000 over the advertised price and finally came down more after more negotiation (I did not read the find print which is why they did not go to 2000 under the advertised price) The sales person was very knowledgeable in some areas and others he was not and it showed. After purchasing the vehicle and driving for a couple days I noticed the AC was not blowing cold air. After taking the vehicle in, I discovered the truck needs around $400 worth of work. The salesperson was made aware of this and did nothing, but when the manager saw this review he offered his assistance and has paid for the repairs.

I was told it be ready by Monday. They never called to tell me it was completed. I had to call and follow up with them. I got my truck 10 days after purchase. Make sure when you buy a car from them that the oil change was done before driving it home. My truck alerted me that an oil change was needed on my drive home. Called miguel when i  got home and he told me to bring it in for an oil change when Im free on them. Tried to call to make an appointment and got no response from miguel. Tried several  times and still nothing. Now when we picked up the car we found out theres one key. Josh says he's gonna call previous owner and let me know if they get it. Once again had to call him several times. Once i got a hold of him he asks me if it was in contract. Kinda hard to have that in a contract whwn i didnt know there was 1 key until  after the ink dried. These folks only care about the sale the after sale is horrible.

Took it back to them immediately and they said after having the truck 24 hours it was underfied at the factory and that was not their fault or problem. They do not pre inspect trucks before leaving just ask for 5 star reviews so they make the most commission. After the fact service is terrible!!!!

113,"May 03, 2019","An advertisement on website of Maxwell said Ford Fiesta $8,288 with payments of $125 per month. I am 18 and it was going to be my first car and loan. After talking for 15 minutes to a salesman, he brought in someone else. I started over. Then, they came to me after being gone for 20 minutes and said the car was unavailable and in servicing and not ready to put back out on the lot until next Tuesday. We couldn't look at it because of paint fumes from spray painting the bumper.

When Travis came back, he said he was sorry and we had to start over with a salesman named Trent. He said the other car was not available. The day before, Eddie told us to make the 1 and half hour drive to the dealership and the car was ready to take home with us if all went well. Lie.

Now, Trent said he had another car that matched our requirements and drove it around to the front. It was a 2008 instead of the 2015 Fiesta advertised and had a sticker price of $2,500 more.

Then, I said I would like to buy the one in service and he brought out a paper for me to agree to for a 2013 Ford Fiesta with a list price of $12,000 and a sales price of $10,000. By now this was getting old how I was being treated.

In conclusion, I was told by Eddie of Maxwell the car was available and a deal could be worked out and we just needed to drive 1 and half hour and meet him at 10:30. He failed to meet with us and gave Travis to us not saying the car was not available.

I suggest anyone reading this review be very cautious when responding to an advertisement that is so good it gets your attention.  Oh, and yes, when Eddie told us later that it was a stick shift and not an automatic he said someone else does the internet and it was probably a typo.

I called four times over the next 4 days.  On Friday, I was told that my truck was still waiting, up it was the 'next one to go into the shop'...  I heard this same excuse on the previous days, every time I called, the truck was the 'next one to go in'.  Apparently there only one mechanic that can review a possible oil leak.  I told them to pull my truck out of line, I will take it Leif Johnson.  The Server person hung up on me...  Quite the professional attitude for calming irate customers.  Just hang up the phone.

121,"December 31, 2018","What a ridiculous experience I've had with Maxwell Ford.  Two interactions in six months, and both were less than stellar.  In summary: 
1) No ability/willingness to give customers a reasonable-for-the-work being performed waiting period 
2) Poor understanding of service contracts - first response is ""it's not covered"".  Make sure you know your rights.
3) Generally poor customer service.  
4) ADVICE:  Be a good advocate for yourself, particularly if you are female.
The whole tale follows:
The first - an oil change - necessitated a three hour wait for a booked service ""because we like to get everyone in at the same time"".  I have a service maintenance plan, which I asked to use for a piece of door trim (I was just out of the warranty period).  According to the service technician the loose trim would require a new door, which wasn't covered by the contract.  I accepted him at his word, and castigated myself for leaving it until after the warranty had lapsed.  It was only a piece of trim so I bought some super glue to fix it.  I then checked the contract which says that something is covered as long as it's not specifically excluded.  Surprise, surprise, the door wasn't excluded.  I chalked it up to experience.
My latest run-in happened when I invoked the wheel-and-tire coverage I purchased in addition to my service contract.  I damaged two tires and wheels falling into a pot hole, and needed to have them replaced.  I took the damaged parts down to Maxwell (again, a scheduled service), and my technician's first response was ""they're not covered"".  Anticipating idiocy, I had familiarized myself with the contract, which covers ""road hazards, and specifically puts pot holes in that category (unlike road works, which are specifically excluded).  I pointed out the appropriate clause.  Technician seemed surprised ""I didn't know it covered pot hole"" (makes me wonder how many people have been cheated out of replacements).  The tires and wheels were replaced after two trips (i.e. two separate three hour waits), and I thought I was done.  Apparently not; I barely reached home when John, the technician, called to say he needed the DOT numbers from the tires for their records.  I gave him same.  All done?  No, I received another call about a week later to say I needed to come in (a 20 mile drive) so that he could look at the numbers as ""I have him the wrong ones"".  I declined to make that wasted journey, and suggested I send a picture of the tires.  The pictures I showed the same DOT numbers I had given John a week earlier.",2.0

I informed him that I had watched a YouTube video about how easy this could be accomplished, not to mention affordably. He had the same answer after hearing this and re-affirmed to me that this is not something Ford will do, and it would cost me thousands of dollars along with a return of the initial system I have. 

After hanging up with him, I immediately called Leif Johnson Ford. They were friendly, positive and provided a quick ""yes, we can do that for you - no problem"",

131,"March 09, 2018","Long story here.  I was contacted by my sales person Blake Engels that they had found the Mustang I wanted, so I went in yesterday to talk numbers.  After spending about 30 minutes with Blake and crunching numbers, I finally committed to buying the car.  Once verbally committed, I had to wait about an hour before I sat down with the finance guy.  Everything went great with him and signed all the papers and was told that my car would be on their lot either the following day or the next (the car was located at one of their sister dealerships).  Well come today I text Blake asking for an update and he calls me about an hour later and proceeds to tell me that they no longer have that car…I’m sorry, but how can a dealership possibly sell me a car they don’t even have?!?  I asked him that exact question and he told me the excuse that the car was there that morning, but must have been sold while negotiations were going on with us.  Can someone tell me why in the world they would not check first to make sure it was still available after they got my commitment while I waited an ENTIRE HOUR before signing papers??  I asked that too and again their response was more bs saying they did in fact call the guy, but he just didn’t answer.  Right.  Blake tried to convince me to maybe change the color since they had one available in a different color, but I told him I was dead set on the color (after all they did just sell me a car IN THAT COLOR).  He told me he’d call me right back and 30 minutes later he does call me back and says they’ve located another car and that all was good and he’d call me back in a few days when it was ready.  I asked how he could find another mustang that quickly that had exactly everything I wanted (and had already put a down payment and signed papers for) and that’s when he goes welllll it’s exactly like the one you bought EXCEPT it doesn’t have the active valve exhaust…I honestly couldn’t believe he was going let me drive a car off the lot that had less features than what I had purchased.  I believe he would not have given me the truth had I not asked.  At this point I was done with the bs Blake kept trying to tell me and I told him I wanted his supervisor’s name and would be at the dealership in 10 minutes to talk to them.  When I got to the dealership I spoke to 3 different people and they all told me the same bs and all tried to push the Mustang with less features than the one I had already bought.  I told all 3 of them that I didn’t want to do business with them anymore and I just wanted my refund and all paperwork cancelled.  I had to say this multiple times to every single one of them, as they would not listen.  I was there for a good hour before I was finally able to get my refund and paperwork cancelled.

I didn’t feel at ease with them, so I took it to a trusted neighborhood shop, and they ensured me that the damage was moreso cosmetic (rust from living in snowy areas), and nothing that would make my car fall apart while driving.

He didn't give me my military discount or the wheel alignment discount of $59.99. The only discount I received was some FDA VIP DISCOUNT.

308,"July 30, 2017","I called during the week to make an appointment and ask about getting three things checked out which are all under warranty since vehicle only has 31k miles. Appt was made for Friday AM.

Drove up on Friday at 7am to get an oil change and get three things inspected: window/wind noise on hwy, engine doesn't shut off when off, and Bluetooth not connecting. I also asked if they could take a look at console because there are always ants there for no reason.

Woman who greets me is very nice and says they probably won't look at it today but hopefully before Monday since their open on Saturday. 

Monday afternoon, I get a call that they haven't even looked at it because they are backed up. She will try and get it looked at the next day.

Tuesday afternoon, I get a call that they haven't looked at it but will try and get oil change done the next day. 

Wednesday afternoon, I don't get a call. Thursday afternoon - no call. And by Friday I'm thinking this is pretty ridiculous because I need my car and I couldn't continue to borrow my father-in-law's car.

So we call and ask to speak with a manager who says he doesn't know why I thought it would be fast because they always take 7-10 days to complete jobs. And that they are actually the fastest then any other dealership. I mention that if I was told it would take 7-10 days I would have declined and just got the oil change. He tells me the oil change was done and they will get to warranty work soon. 

I didn't pick up my vehicle until the next week Tuesday. A month later I'm disappointed to report that the Bluetooth still doesn't work properly, there is still noise on the Hwy, and now the tire lights went on. We checked the tire pressure and they were all at 30 with one tire a little below. Tire pressure should have been inspected with the multipoint inspection and now I don't believe they did anything.

It didn't take long at all to complete the work once they got to it. They need a better system because if they can't even look at a car until 7 days after being dropped off then something needs to change. They should allow the option to customers who are able to be on a waiting list and get called that they can bring their car in the next day or two days before. That way cars aren't sitting there for a week until they get to it. I get that you never know how long one job will take but there has to be an average and another way to do business. Not everyone can be without a car for two weeks.

I didn't even mention that the waiting room is small. When I first dropped off the car we had to wait because the complimentary shuttle driver called in so they asked a mechanic to drive us home. When I did pick up the car they asked if I wanted a car wash which I believe is a given and should have been done already. Then when they brought me my car they told me the car wash was broken. Pretty sad all around and has motivated us to sell our 2016 Ford Escape and get a Honda or Toyota which has wonderful dealership service from past experience.",1.0

I took it to the BMW dealership (which was 20+ miles away) and they said there's nothing wrong with it & that there's nothing to check since the light wasn't on. (which is what i told the ford dealership before). The person who checked my BMW at their dealership gave me her card for the Ford dealership to contact her in the event they had any questions. So i take it back to the ford dealership, and they said the light was on again and it would drop my trade-in value significantly! Now if anyone can explain how that light magically comes on when they're appraising it, but doesn't come on when i leave nor over the next two days... but when they appraise it again, its on?! Long story short, i know when business are acting in a manner to maximize on an opportunity & that's exactly what they tried! Such classlessness & a tremendous lack of integrity in their processes.

423,"May 31, 2017","After seeing a great price on an internet advertisement for an F150 truck, I called and spoke with a salesman to confirm the inventory was available at the stated internet price before visiting and they said yes. I test drove and was then told of $1,800 of dealer add-ons (unadvertised) that I would have to pay for and they would only do the deal if I took a low ball price on a trade-in.. When I asked them to remove the trade-in from negotiations, they actually refused to do the deal altogether unless I traded in because they would lose money at their advertised price plus the $1,800.  They played all sorts of games (back to the manager 4 times) that I thought dealers gave up in the dark ages. I guess they thought we had spent so much time we would not go elsewhere.

Then they had the gall to say all dealers do the same thing and include unadvertised add-ons like they do.

That was the biggest lie. We went to Covert at 183 and got a price less than Maxwells advertised teaser price (with the $1,800 dealer add-ons). No games (back and forth to the manager). Picked our truck and closed the deal in 90 minutes.

Don't waste your time with Maxwell, go see Covert.

I went to Maxwell Ford on Tuesday December the 20th for an oil change. I had to get a rental car to be able to drive for work. I tried calling the service advisor and the service manager for any update the following days but never heard from anyone until a Friday afternoon. Honeslty the costumer service by these employees is the worse I've ever experienced at this location by the time I picked the truck up and check the job done the oil stick was below the low level. My question is ""What did they do 4 days with my truck???"" I can't belive they did a very poor job in so many days. Plus my truck has two dings on the side and broken oil stick. This service was deplorable. Be aware of this location how they treat their customers so better go to different location because here they will take any advantage from you.",1.0
431,"December 22, 2016","I took my new edge into Maxwell to get 3 things fixed that had not worked since I bought the NEW vehicle.  One: the adaptive steering went out and transmission light would stay on.  2: the second row seat left side would not fold down with the push button feature. 3:  the rear windshield wiper blade was completely warped.  Took it in in Sept.  they kept it for over a week.  Never called.  I had to call to find out what was going on.   It wasn't looked at for DAYS AFTER MY APPOINTMENT!!  They said the adaptive steering was a code problem, and were looking at the seat problem.  The next day I was told the adaptive steering and seat issue needed parts that were ""emergency ordered""  Again a few days later,  I call to see what's going on.  NO PARTS.  I pick up my vehicle with a promise to be called when parts came in.  SIMPLE WINDSHIELD WIPER REPLACEMENT NOT DONE!!   SKIP to Nov and my parts are finally in.  Am promised a rental car by Matt.  Make the appt. to bring it in.  NO Rental for me on the lot. Luckily new service technician Alex calls to see if he can get me one.  Says it will take 15 mins tops.  I say I'll come back another day as my mother is in hospital and I don't have time for this.  Promised 15 mins tops.  45 minutes later,  I ask for my vehicle back as I don't have time for this!!!  Alex personally takes me to get a rental car off the lot.  They keep my car for a week.  I have to call to see what's going on with it.  Am told that it is not fixed, more parts being ordered, and I can come get it.  When I show up Alex is at lunch.  It takes 2 other people to find my vehicle.  The technician I spoke with tells me that it's not fixed.  It was like pulling teeth to get him to tell me what was wrong with each of the 3 things and why they couldn't be fixed.   3 he says?  When Matt passed me off to Alex, my rear windshield wiper was not on the paper work.  STILL NOT FIXED!!!  As the technician walks me to my car to look at wiper blade,  we both notice that the driver side window is down and it IS RAINING!!  He says they can replace blade right now.  I said I don't have the time.  I get in my vehicle and roll up the window and  turn on AC.  As it comes blasting out of the vents so does an odor of something comparable to greasy fried fish!!!  I am PISSED OFF at Maxwell Ford!  I am promised a good detailing on my car by Alex if I bring my car in.   I travel for a living, and don't have time.  I had to detail it on my own dime as it smelled for days!!  To top it off it looks as if something very sharp was placed on my front passenger seat and almost punctured a hole in it.  
The very best Part?   I took my vehicle to Truck City who was able to fix the rear seat issue and replace the wiper blade very quickly.  Unfortunately because Maxwell drilled holes into my steering wheel and ruined it,  Maxwell will have to do that work!!! ( A new steering wheel has been emergency ordered again.  Was supposed to arrive on Nov 30.  Am being told after Jan 01 now!)  
Maxwell Ford sucks!  When I called Matt as I'm told he's in charge of the service dept. to find out what is going on,   All I got was a generated email from him saying ""Service ticket has been completed!""  xxxxxxxx!!!  All 3 things were NOT fixed by Maxwell.    I don't think they talk to each other up there.  The only nice thing I can say is that Alex is nice and professional.  that's it.  Service sucks!",1.0
432,"December 16, 2016","Jennifer Odom: If you want to find someone who is not only knowledgeable about every truck on the lot and has a good sense of humor while doing it, go see Jennifer Odom at Maxwell. She was a critical resource while considering an F-150 and was even better after I purchased it in making sure I got everything I needed done. Thank you so much Jennifer for making the buying process painless and easy. My truck is exactly what I needed and wanted and I wouldn’t have gotten there without your help and knowledge. I’ll have this truck for a long time, but when I get around to purchasing another one, I won’t go to anyone but Jennifer. ",5.0
433,"November 17, 2016","I purchased a cute little ford fiesta that was a really great deal from Rene Sanchez. I was excited to have a second car in the family. They got me into a really good payment and got me a good deal on a warranty. The next day I had an unexpected issue with the car and brought it into the service department. Anthony was the guy who is taking care of me and he did a fantastic job staying in communication with me through the whole process. They set me up in a loaner car and helped me get to work on time. The repairs took only a few days and they stayed in communication with me the entire time of what was going on. Let me tell you the car that I purchased wasn't that expensive, but I feel like I bought a $60,000 car based off of the service alone. It made me feel really good to have someone treat me with such respect. I would recommend purchasing a car from these guys any day and they have my future business.",5.0

435,"October 30, 2016","Let me tell you about my horrible experience at Maxwell Ford.  I'd like to preface this with the fact that my car is a 2014 Ford Fusion.  That's right, it's 2 years old with about 27K miles on it.

My first appointment was 10/15/2016.  My car is not starting in the mornings.  I can eventually get it started (just by trying over and over again) and when I do, it starts for the rest of the day.  Typically, the next morning, it won't start again.  Sometimes it does.  Sometimes it takes longer than other times. I relay all of this to the person I make the appointment with.  When I get there, it takes them forever to come and actually greet me.  One guy says ""I'll send sometime over"" and then comes back around a few minutes later and asks why I'm here again. Anyway, I finally get someone to come help me - Alex - who is less than impressed with his job and even more so with my car issue. He says, well, they can't do anything if they can't duplicate the issue and if it's starting every time right now, chances are slim that they're going to be able to find out what's wrong with it (at this point it hadn't been doing it for a couple of days). So he tells me he's going to check the battery and if that's all good, it's up to me if I want to leave it but again, he can't guarantee anything. So he checks the battery - it's good. I end up taking it because he doesn't think they'll be able to duplicate the issue. Great, thanks Alex.  There's probably not something wrong with my car.  He tells me to ""go a road trip"".  Okay, thank you for the advice but I shouldn't have to road trip just to get my car to work properly. 

Surprise, surprise, it happens again! This time it's worse - it's taking longer than normal to start and it's becoming a big pain in the xxx.  So I make another appointment and when I do, I try to send a video of what's happening prior to me bringing it in. They won't allow me to do that because, again, if they can't duplicate the issue it doesn't matter. I'm not too impressed with this answer but it is what it is. I get assigned to my service person, Jackie. She's worse than Alex.

Basically, I drop my car off the night of 10/26/2016 so that hopefully the car won't start on the morning of the 27th and hopefully they'll be able to ""duplicate the issue"" and fix my car. I only did this per the suggestion of Freddie, who talked to me when Jackie was out. He was the ONLY decent person I've dealt with at Maxwell Ford.  Still not extremely helpful but at least nice and acted like he cared, even if he didn't. That goes a long ways, folks.  

Anyway, after explaining the issue to Alex for the 11th time when I dropped the car off, I left it there.  It didn't start the next morning.  I didn't find this out until noon, though. Because I had to call and check on my car.  Every single interaction I had with Maxwell Ford was ME calling to check up on my car.  I swear if I would have never called them, they would still have it with no word to me about anything. I had appointment at 7:30am the next morning, my car was there more than 12 hours ahead of time. You should have called by 10am at the latest.  So I find out that my car doesn't start the next morning, which means - THEY DUPLICATED THE ISSUE!! Turns out that wasn't helpful. Basically, they still couldn't figure out what was wrong with it. When they did finally get it started, Jackie calls me and says ""they got it started, it's starting every time now"". Was she even listening to me when I told her what the issue was? YES, JACKIE.  That's what it does!  It doesn't start in the mornings and then it starts for the rest of the day.  Jesus.  So I said, no I'm not taking my car home if you've done NOTHING to fix it. That was Friday (the 28th).  So she calls me the next day, the 29th (after I call her to check the status, mind you) - she says it started and he can't find anything wrong with it.  You can come pick it up.  So at this point I pretty much know they've done nothing to fix my car but I can't wait to get it away from them so I pick it up anyway. I go to start it this morning (next day) and I'll let you guess what happened.  I'm now going to have to start this process with a new ford dealership. I'm hoping they are at least better to work with and have more decency for their customers.  Thanks for absolutely nothing, Maxwell Ford!",1.8

438,"October 23, 2016","So, the Service Center at Maxwell Ford would've received 5 stars if I hadn't gone through the frustration with their persons whom answer their phones. 
So, let's start- 3-4 weeks ago, I called to schedule an oil change. (You don't need to schedule) Their reply, ""oh you don't need one (oil change) until 5000 miles"". LOL. To which I said, well, How do you know what my mileage is? 
Then I stated, My car keeps feeling like it was to take off on it's own when I'm in park, like at a red light. The guys reply, ""Oh, it's probably nothing"". What the? To which I say, ""Oh, it's normal for a brand new car to want to take off by itself?"" Sarcasm on my part, filled with frustration. I tell him I'll call back after I check my mileage.
Last week- I call reference to needing an oil change and noticing on their website, at my login, that I have a re-call. The gentleman agrees to put me on for Saturday Morning, 730 am. As for the re-call, he says it'll take 2-3 days to repair. To which I ask about a loaner vehicle. He says, ""oh no, we don't do that"". I say, ""But it's a brand new car, My very 1st oil change, I shouldn't have to do this"". He says, ""Well, if the re-call isn't fixed, your car could all of sudden stop, or reduce speed like from 70 mph to 40 or worse 20 mph. : / eeek! Yes, Okay, let's get this done, but I have a job, need a car. NO other vehicle in my household. He says he'll transfer me to new car sales. ""They can help"" he says. Transferred to silence and no one ever answered.
Yesterday, Oct 22, 2016. I drove into Maxwell Ford, expecting an oil change, and knowing I'll have to speak to someone to get the re-call issue addressed. (Throttle replacement). I speak to a young man named Albert- very nice,(Albert tells me my wait will be 2-3 hours) who then sends John Mikolasek to me. I think this gentleman must've certainly come straight out of the 60-70's because he had that kind of respectful friendliness, and a listening ear with absolutely no type of condescending flair nor looks. John is genuinely nice! ( or he's a darn good actor-giggle)
He takes my vehicle information for the inspection, and tells me he'll get-Matt, one of their managers. As I wait in the lobby, probably no longer than 15-30 minutes, John tells me that Matt Clegg is now ready to speak to me. What? So he was serious? About getting me help?
So, Matt, tells me, ""I'll tell you what."" or something along those lines. ""Let's get the oil change and the throttle issue fixed today"". ""If you don't mind waiting 2-3 hours, I have a technician just waiting to get started on that sort of an issue"". What? Someone pinch me. I asked Matt if I could pinch him, to which, he politely said, ""ah... no"". I reply, ""I just want to make sure that you're real"". We joke, talk about football- namely last week's UT win, of which I'd attended. : ) I go back to the waiting area. and it took just 2 hours and about 7 minutes for the job to be done. I started my timer right after I spoke to the 1st guy-Albert- and sorry, I didn't get his last name. He as also extremely pleasant. Oh and let's not leave out, Susan Watt and the exit desk. She was very nice, reminded me of a smiling emoji. : ) When I mentioned that I was going to Formula 1, she said, ""oh wait, we have a program for Formula 1 in here, Let me walk out with you and get you one"". 
What the? I thought I was going to wake up in bed and realize that this wonderful TEAM had just been a dream. It wasn't a dream. This TEAM made me say, their coffee was good, I got to watch some football, and deal with absolutely no frustration. (Except the one I drove up with when I thought I was going to get the run around that I'd gotten on the phone before speaking to this group)
So, The only reason this review is not 5 stars, is due to their phone service. 4 calls, two said i needed appointment, two said I didn't, 1 said throttle issue would be 2-3 days AND that they couldn't help with a loaner vehicle. AND the 1st one thought he could read my cars mileage over the phone. LOL... 
Thank God their on sight TEAM does not reflect the phone TEAM. Please repair your phone TEAM. They need help with customer service. 
Susan, John, Matt Clegg, and Albert- Hats off to ya! Keep up the good work!",4.7
439,"October 17, 2016","I used to swear by Maxwell Ford and I refused to buy a vehicle anywhere else but recently, I've had a pretty rude awakening in the form of their service department. 

We've used their service department before this while our Expedition was still under warranty and each time there were a few issues with things like communication and speed of service, but nothing big enough for me to swear off of them forever. But this last visit takes the cake.

So the story starts on a Sunday. Our Expedition starts feeling ""weird"" and the engine light comes on. My husband and I immediatly make a plan to take it in to be serviced the next day but the car decides it just can't make it that long and stalls out completley by that afternoon. We realize that it's a Sunday and there's nothing really open but we try to make whatever arrangments we can to get the car towed to Maxwell Ford and get a rental. But because just about everything is closed, we can't get much done until the next day. Monday comes and once again we try to sync up with the service department at Maxwell Ford and just like in the past, there's communication issues, lots of ""we'll call you back""s and not knowing who is handling what. Finally, on Tuesday, we get the car into the service center and get a rental. 

First, we find out that we are 500 miles past our warranty so everything will have to be done out of pocket. Then, the guy at the service center tells us that he needs to run a diagnostic on it which will take all night. Then suddenly, a few hours later, he calls us to tell us the diagnostic is done and that our engine is completely fried. He says we are 20,000 miles past needing an oil change which caused sludge to build up in the engine and now we need to get the entire engine replaced, which will cost more than the car is worth. He says that he'll do us a favor though and work to get us a $500 credit for our vehicle that we can put towards getting a new car, granted we get it there. In the meantime, the charge for the ""diagnostic"" is $260.

We believe him, because quite frankly, we're idiots when it comes to cars. We know we can't afford a new car and all of this, including the rental was already taking a huge hit to our wallets. But we go home and start pooling money together, trying to free up whatever we can so we can afford car payments, and then we go back to talk to a car salesman. The salesman was nice enough, was working extra hard to make something work within our price range but then he said a few things that tipped us off that we might be being scammed. So instead of buying a new car, we payed what we owed the service department and had our Expedition towed back to our house.

A week from the initial breakdown, we take to car to another mechanic for a second opinion. It takes the guy all of 15 minutes to look at the car and tell us we were ripped off. Yes, there was sludge in the engine and we badly needed an oil change, but the engine was running fine. He put 5 quarts of oil in it to start draining the sludge and cranked it up - and the car ran perfectly. The official diagnosis - We needed an oil change, a new oil filter, a new oil sensor, and a new air filter - all of which would only cost us around $200 parts and labor. THAT'S IT.

Apparently, Maxwell Ford is in the business of scamming people who don't know much about cars. They would have gotten our car, been able to make a few minor repairs and sell it for a good $9,000+ as a used car PLUS make an additional $10,000 from us financing a new used car through them. Not to mention the $260 ""diagnostic"" charge that I'm pretty certain consisted of a mechanic just pulling out the oil dipstick and seeing sludge. 

Beware of scam artists, especially the ones that hide behind reputable branding.

They told me they'd have my service rep (Hunter) call me back. Never received a call back and they had done zero work on it Wednesday the 6 hours it was there Wednesday.

452,"March 22, 2016","This review is the culmination of several visits from the past year or two. I have never written a negative review before, but my experiences with this service department in particular has led me to post this.  I bought my truck from another Ford Dealership, but I live in South Austin, so I thought I would get my truck serviced at my nearest dealership.  I have had nothing but positive experiences with the other dealership, so I figured I would get another similar experience here.  On the first few attempts at obtaining warranty service work for an issue which I aligned with my regular oil changes, I walked in (when they opened), made appointments, and tried everything I could in order to get my trucked serviced within my busy schedule.  At the end of the day, I would always get a phone call stating ""we were unable to get to your service work today, so we'll try to get to it tomorrow"".  Being a busy person and thinking either by walking in or setting an appointment, they would surely be able to get it done, but that was never the case. To the shops credit, they would do the oil change, but the warranty work was never completed.  Finally, I found the perfect time to take my truck in. I was leaving on vacation for 5 days and thought, surely, this would be enough time for them to complete the work and I can pick up my truck when I return. NOPE!  My truck was not ready until 2 days after I returned!  Finally, the last straw occurred recently, as I gave the shop one last shot to make right.  I took my truck in for a regular oil change.  I paid for the Works, which includes an oil change and tire rotation.  Was I surprised when I figured out that the tires were NOT rotated? Nope!  How do I know this?  From a marking on one of my tires that was still in the same tire position.  This service department is a case study in incompetence, poor customer service, and frustration. I was not surprised to see the many negative reviews as I perused the yelp reviews.  Do not utilize this service department unless you are prepared to be frustrated, angry, fed up, and NOT have your vehicle serviced as it should be. I will never again feel like an idiot waiting for someone to help me at the service bay (even when I did have an appt), as the Maxwell Ford employees looked at me from their offices, walked passed me, and would not even attempt to ask me if I needed help (EVERY SINGLE TIME).  I guarantee all of the above will happen if you take your vehicle here.  ",1.0

456,"January 21, 2016","To whom it may concern, 

Today, 1/20/2016, I went to the Maxwell dealership on 5000 IH-35 Austin, TX 78745 and dropped off my vehicle for an estimate on what it would cost for my 2009 Ford F-150 to get the brake pads redone.  I apologize for the lengthiness of this note but if you are getting service at this location it would be best for you to read through.  I had a coupon I get on a monthly basis and my brakes were starting to make noise so I decided to go and use it.  I often get my oil changed here and have also purchased several vehicles from Maxwell so I’ve always felt like they are reputable company.  Today that changed.  I dropped off my vehicle around 8:00am and took the shuttle back to work.  On the way back to work I got a phone call saying from the representative named Anthony Vento that I may need may brake work done and further replacements and that they would call me back.  At 9:12am I receive a phone call from Anthony and he states that what I thought would be roughly $200 or so with tax and whatever else would really end up being $1350 because they were taking $150 off with my coupon.  They also told me I had a leak with a power steering belt as well.  At that point I said “I understand my brakes need to be done but do I really need the back rotors replaced also”.  “Can you figure it out and let me know what it would cost if I didn’t replace them and what the cost would be then”. (I was only expecting to pay $200 or so when I first got there)  Anthony told me he was going to speak to his technician and see if I needed them and call me back.  I ate breakfast with a coworker and was telling him how expensive it seemed and as we spoke I called “Brake Check” and they let me know they could do it for around $600 plus tax or so for everything I was getting at Maxwell.  I was pretty surprised so called Anthony back at 10:19 since I hadn’t heard from him and let him know through a message I would rather hold off on the brakes since I had found a more reasonable place but wanted to move forward with the oil change and the power steering hose.  I called back at 11:57, 11:58 and 11:59 until I got answer because his mailbox was full and I could no longer leave messages.  At that point he told me the back rotors were too worn and would need to be replaced also.  I told him I had called brake check and that it would be too expensive for me to fix them there at Maxwell, when he said that they were already working on the vehicle.  I told him I was still waiting on the final price and he thought I approved the work when I was still trying to find pricing.  I also told him I had left him a message and had said I didn’t want the work done.  At that point he told me he had misunderstood and thought I wanted the work done.  I told him I wasn’t sure where he got that from since I was still trying to see if the back rotors even needed replacing.  He told me he was going to talk to his managers and get back to me on the confusion.  I waited for a bit and called him back at 12:28 and told him if he had spoke to his managers and wanted all work stopped on my vehicle at that point.  At that point he told me “that was problem, my truck was completed”.  I couldn’t believe what was going on.  I told him I was really confused and didn’t know what was going on, and that I hadn’t gave a “go” for any work.  He told me he misunderstood and that he thought I wanted the work complete.  I told him I never gave a “yes” to go ahead and that I had gone in to spend $200 per there coupon and now I was looking at $1350 plus.  He told me he was going to speak with his manager and get back to me.  Anthony called me back at 12:55 and told me he had spoken the parts manager and the service manager and they were reducing the price but they would not get me to the “Brake Check” price.  I told him I didn’t know what was going on and that I wanted to speak to someone in person and would be headed there as soon as my work permitted and that I wanted to speak to his manager as well.  He then proceeded to tell me I needed to meet him half way with the price because of what they were they doing for me… Sorry, but this continues for…
I get dropped off at the dealership and Anthony tells me to wait for his manager (Ruben Fernandez-Service Director) in the lobby. I sit there for about 15 minutes as I hear him laughing with the people in his office but its fine, I’m a manager also and I know he is attending to his business.  After a while Ruben calls me into his office and shakes my hand and stares at me for a bit and asks me how he can help me.  I ask him if he knows what my situation is and he states he does and proceeds to tell me with both hands behind his head and reclined on his chair that I just had $1300 worth of repairs on my truck and that he is not letting it go without payment.  I explain to him my situation and talk to him about everything that has happened and he tells me that he spoke with his team and he feels I agreed on the repairs and that is what it should be.  At that point I ask him why I would feel inclined to call other establishments and ask for price quotes when I would have agreed at with Maxwell ford.  It just did not make sense.  His arrogance astonished me when at that point he was asking me to pay a very substantial bill.  At that point I asked him to call Anthony because I felt it necessary to have him tell me that I had agreed to any type of work done on my vehicle at all.  He called in Anthony and while he did so he had another phone where he explained to what I can only assume was another unsatisfied customer about how understaffed he was, and how he knew his department was broken, but that he should understand that he had moved his vehicle in front of 25 of other vehicles so he didn’t understand while he was still unhappy.  At that point I understood the level of service I would be getting.  Anthony walked into the room along with the service manager whose name I believe is Paul Ward.  I asked Anthony at what point he believed I agreed to have the work done and he said when I said “it needs to be done” was like me saying “go ahead and do it”.  At this point Ruben tells me “I would have thought the same thing”.  “To me it’s a yes and go forward with it.”  At that point I call my cousin who is an attorney because I cannot I am getting treated this way and pretty much ambushed and he tells me I’m not releasing the vehicle, I’m following everything by the book.  Then Ruben tells the service manager tell him (me) what you heard.  Service Manager tells me, and this is a quote “I was walking by and I heard you say go ahead and do it, let me know when it’s done”.  I have never met this person, or spoken to him but they recognized my voice and knew I was telling Anthony to go forward on the work on my vehicle.  I ended up paying today $801+ change.  My name is Israel Villalon.  I’ve worked for Target for almost 15 years as an Executive Team Leader.  I’m not afraid to say who I am because I know I did nothing wrong.  I just want everyone to know about the unethical behavior that is happing at this establishment.  It was embarrassing what happened to me today.  I have never met such an un-genuine person as Ruben today and getting taken into an office only to be made to feel like a liar.  I have always been a Ford guy and like I said previously have purchased several vehicles from Maxwell but well look elsewhere going forward along with my family and friends.  I will also make it my duty to make sure everyone knows about what happened to me today at Maxwell Ford – Motor Mile –South Austin.

She told me in a later phone conversation that the rig would be ready most likely by the end of the day (Monday), but for sure before noon on Tuesday.

I decided that was worth a try. I went down to the dealership and started talking with a salesman he proceeded to tell me that the car I had bought for 26k in 2012 was only going to be worth 8k and that if I wanted to move forward with the 2014 mustang gt I was looking at I was going to need to commit to the $500 monthly payments.

Even after the sale was agreed on and completed, he took the time to introduce us to our new car and make sure all of our questions were answered.

466,"June 27, 2015","First off, I do not write many bad reviews. But this experience was my worst at a dealer. Here is the experience. I was very specifically looking for the 50th anniversary Mustang. They had two. The sales rep was standing by the car and looked at me with a strange look as I checked to see if it was unlocked. It was locked and my wife asked to see it. The sales rep responded with ""its locked"". Not an offer the get the Key. He walked away a bit before I stopped him and said, please go get the key so that I may see the inside of this vehicle. He did oblige at that moment. NOW, we test drive, no problems. Unfortunately I know far more about the vehicle that the person trying to sell me the car. So I can not ask my questions. Again, I can let that slide, they don't make a lot of money and cant know it all. This particular car was on Autotrader from the dealer and the dealers website. I checked both before I got there. The window still say 30K over sticker and I confirmed that would not be there based on the fact the vehicle was on special at sticker price. Again, I am fine here. Now I say, I will take the car. The rep then comes back after a manager told them to add a markup even though it was advertised at sticker. They tried to convince me that I had to pay a markup above their advertised price that was on their site and on auto trader. After some banter, I told them I am leaving as it is dishonest. Magically, now they can sell it at the advertised price.... I am not an uniformed shopper, so it is disappointing that the dealer would bully and lie directly to my face like that and to also have zero respect for the customer to begin with as they come to see the vehicle. I will drive to Houston before I would confidently give this dealer my business. ",1.0

They never even performed a diagnostic on the car.  They said they took it out on the road to test the issue I brought it in for, but there was no mileage change on the paperwork or odometer.  They said the car had too many miles to bother to do a diagnostic that I should just blindly( my word) just completely replace the engine.   When I questioned why they didn't perform a diagnostic or call me and ask my if  wanted any kind of diagnostic, but simply just say ""replace the engine"", there was no direct answer.   It's my decision if I want them to perform a diagnostic and to give me options to make a decision, not for them to decide they didn't want to do it.

I was so impressed with his patience, and sincere desire to find a car that I would be happy with on every level. I have had many salesmen in the past work me over due to their desire to sell me a vehicle based on THEIR desire to either move a vehicle, earn a commision , or any of a number of selfish reasons that made it clear to me that my needs were not a priority. Carlos would rather not sell me a vehicle at all than sell me the wrong one.

I met with Paul and gave him a detailed list of my issues.
After waiting 10 hours and not hearing anything from the service department, I called Paul's direct line and he did not answer.  When I finally reached Paul after calling the main service line, he informed me that they did not get to my car today???

494,"May 11, 2013","I dropped in on a Friday, early afternoon to explore the possibility of trading my 2011 Taures for a 2012 Wrangler that they had. I immediately explained that I was short on time. I Provieded the salesman  Collin Farmer with my maximum budget and asked that they appraise my trade in. They took my keys, and kept them until roughly 7pm when I demanded that they give them back to me. As they continually shoved numbers in front of me that were far above my maximum budget, I continually thanked Collin for his time and explained that I needed to be somewhere. he kept asking me to give them a shot. Eventually, the manager, Scott Robinson agreed to my budget numbers. They congratulated me on my purchase, and had me sign under the numbers to agree that we had a deal. Several hours later, I was FINALLY invited to finance to sight the paperwork. I was completely shocked when the finance manager laid out a completely different deal than we had ageed upon. Monthly payments were almost 10% higher! I stood up and asked him if they were going to honor the deal that they had agreed to or not. He asked to explain. I told him it was a simple yes or no answer. His answer was no. Apparently they had added too much to the Jeeps sales price for the bank to accept.

1. This process should have been far more expedient. I'm fine that they could make a deal that I was comfortable with and I explained that as I tried to leave no less than five times. To keep me for almost 5 hours and cause me to miss an appointment, all for nothing, is inexcusable.
2. They did not, in my case honor the numbers that Scott Robinson proposed and had me agree to with my signature. 

Perhaps this was an anomaly, but it was for me a terrible experience. I feel that I was clearly deceived into staying there. Every time I tried to leave, they told me what they had to to keep me there only to completely change the terms after almost 5 hours. VERY DECEPTIVE. If you can't do a mutually agreeable transaction, be honest and let the customer know.

495,"May 08, 2013","My husband and I bought a truck from Maxwell Ford in June 2012. We were so pleased with Matt’ Mauer’s service that we went back to them on April 5, 2013. I had made it a point to get pre-approved prior to going to the dealership but when we got there, Matt said that I wasn’t really “pre-approved” through my bank and that I needed to fill out another application. I told him that yes I was and he said that the finance manager said I wasn’t approved for the amount of my car. It was a Friday evening so I couldn’t call my bank. Earlier in the day, my bank had asked that I ask the dealership to send over a purchase order and they wouldn’t do it because they said we would take care of all the paperwork when I got there. I argued with them about me being pre-approved and they said I was wrong. The finance manager even came out and talked to me. Then they said to put my husband on the loan and my husband refused and said to forget the whole thing we were leaving. Then all of a sudden the finance manager comes back and says that the bank manager called and said to make an exception for me! Who me? Who am I to make an exception for?! I ended up getting my car, and have called up there numerous times for my plates and keypad entry code. No one has answers and my salesman from what Brenda told me quit. He took vacation and then quit the next Monday. What the heck is going on over there? I strongly recommend you stay away from this place and take your business elsewhere! Our first experience was good and you’d think they would want to keep our business since we were buying another car there, but instead they chose to be snakes and be sneaky. I honestly think our salesman felt bad for what they were doing to us and wanted no part in it. Now I am left with them running my credit A LOT of times, no license plates (yet), no keypad entry code and a very bad taste in my mouth from these people. Oh yeah, the CEO, Bill Scott’s name is on the survey they send afterwards. I filled out the survey and emailed the CEO. No response. I guess he enjoys running a dealership that is based on lies, deception, deceitfulness, manipulation, dishonesty, but especially a disservice to anyone who comes near them.

499,"February 28, 2013",Denny Tharp at Maxwell Ford was someone that created a great sales experience for me. I was looking to get a new car and had a pretty good idea of what I wanted to get. He didn't try to upsell me to a car out of my budget of something I didn't want. He was very thorough and helped me get to a price I was comfortable with. He even walked into the finance office with me and set the expectation for them to give me the best rate. ,5.0

501,"November 30, 2012",I went in to maxwell ford on black friday hoping to find a good deal but I didn't  I found something even better. My sales man Edgar helped me find the best car to meet my needs with all the extra luxury I wanted. on top of that he helped me get a ton of rebates from ford and showed me that with the company I worked for I got a corporate discount. I initially went in with the intention of not paying more than 30k for a brand new car. Well I didn't I got it a little over twenty and then he helped me find financing for days until we found a bank that gave me a better deal than I could of imagined. Now I have a brand new luxurious car with a payment that doesn't break the bank. I didn't get a good deal with Edgar I got the best deal possible. I wouldn't consider going anywhere else from now on. He's a car sales man on the customers side.,4.8

505,"November 25, 2012","We visited other dealers before visiting Maxwell Ford. Each dealer we visited would tell you one thing and then after spending hours there, they would not follow through. It was (what we thought) the ""typical"" car buying experience. We found the car we wanted on line at Maxwell Ford's website and called and spoke to Edgar Cruz before we planned on driving down. He was very responsive and called us back within minutes to confirm the car was available. When we arrived we were greeted right away and everyone we saw asked us if we had been helped yet. Edgar was wonderful! He wasn't pushy, knew what we were looking for and what we wanted for our trade. Maxwell Ford gave us everything we wanted...the exact amount we asked for on our trade, a great deal on our pre-owned Altima and working with Edgar made our entire experience even better. I would recommend Edgar to anyone who is looking for a new or pre-onwed car. He is very knowledgable and will work hard to make you happy. We had to wait a bit for the finance department but Edgar kept on checking with us and made sure we were doing OK. Overall this was the most pleasant buying experience we have ever had.

511,"November 12, 2012","I was very happy with my 2009 Focus when I first purchased it. The only thing that kind of threw me off was the fact that Jeff ASKED me to give him 5 stars on a review. That is ridiculous, I will give you however many stars you deserve (which is very little due to the service we have had after we gave them our money).

The day after we bought it we were hearing an odd noise coming from the tires. We called to see if we could take it in for them to check it out and they said they could take a look at it that day. Well, they weren't able to look at it until the next day after I had to find a ride to work. Jeff said there was nothing ""major"" wrong with it. I'm sorry, but there shouldn't be ANYTHING wrong with it. He apologized saying that he worded that wrong and there was nothing at all wrong with it. My boyfriend was not pleased with that answer so he called to talk with the service department. When he talked to them they told him that the noise was because the tires were cupping. In my opinion, they should have had new tires put on the car for safety reasons. We decided to get a second opinion just to make sure there was nothing else wrong with the car. The guy we took it to said both the front and back were out of alignment pretty bad and that it had to have happened by hitting a curb or something (which I did NOT do). We ended up having to pay $80 to get it aligned. When I took in the bill to Maxwell they didn't want to pay anything since it could have happened by hitting a pot hole right after we left the dealership. I'm pretty sure I would have remembered hitting something major seeing as I had the car for less than a week! After arguing back and forth with them they agreed to pay for half. It should have already been done but them but half is better than nothing. 

And guess what happened a few months later? I got a letter in the mail the end of October from Sirius radio saying that my 3 month trial is up in November. This was the first time I even heard of having a free trial so I called sirius to explain that I didn't know I had the trial and asked if it could be extended. They let me know that it is the dealerships responsibility to let us know since it is negotiated into the price of the vehicle and that I would have to talk to them about getting it extended. Well, here I am two and a half weeks after I called Jeff about it and he still hasn't called me backt. I called to find of what was taking so long a week ago and his excuse was that he hasn't been able to get ahold of them. I was able to talk to someone the first time I called so I find that hard to believe. 

So after my experience with their customer service, I would not recommend them. I love my car but the dealership just doesn't give a crap about you after they sell you the car. ",2.6
512,"October 20, 2012","I will say i made the salesman's job a bit easy, since i am a researched buyer.  I will learn as much as i can about something I'm interested in before i buy it, so when i drove up to Maxwell Ford to look at a used Infiniti QX4, all i really needed help with was seeing the vehicle, test driving it, and then ultimately finalizing the sale.  I didn't require info on the vehicle, nor did i need help deciding which vehicle was right for me.  I drove in knowing exactly what i wanted to see.  That being said, Edgar Cruz was quick to help me, and made the whole &quot;sales&quot; experience as effortless and simple as possible.  We went for a test drive, and he was more than happy to oblige my somewhat &quot;excessive&quot; testing when test driving.

When i had decided i wanted to buy the car, we started the paperwork process, which even the best of salesman couldn't make a pleasant process, but none the less, Mr. Cruz did a fine job of making it as painless as possible.  The process of buying cars at dealerships has never been something i enjoyed, but i will say my dealings with Mr. Cruz and Maxwell Ford was the best experience I've had at a dealership yet, they were kind, friendly, and worked with me on my requirements.

As for the haggling, the only issue i had during the &quot;Haggle&quot; process, was what they valued my trade, which was low low low (again, reason i hate dealerships).  I was stern but polite with Mr. Cruz, and said they had to do better.  Mr. Cruz asked me what i expected, and after telling him, after a quick visit with the powers that be, he came back with some more acceptable numbers.  Still below what i thought my trade was worth, but within the range i deemed acceptable.  We came to an agreement, pending financing numbers, which were better than i expected.  I do not blame Mr. Cruz for the low ball offer on my trade, nor do i blame Maxwell Ford.  This is simply something one would expect from a dealership, and if your not firm in what you expect, and arm yourself with some knowledge prior to your visit, they can take advantage of you.  To be clear, i expected a low offer regardless of what dealership i visited.

Financial department visit was quick, easy, and well explained.  Unfortunately i cant remember the name of the guy i dealt with, but he was very nice, and walked me through the things i didnt understand, and further informed me on the things i did.  They were able to get me a better interest rate than i expected, and got my payments right where i wanted them for a short term loan.

Overall i left the dealership pleased.  I cant speak to the full extent of Mr. Cruz's knowledge about the vehicle he sold me, since A: it was an Infiniti brand at a Ford dealership, and B: I believe Mr. Cruz recognized that i had studied up on the car before arriving.  However, being a car guy myself, i did ask him some questions about some of the new Ford models, particularly the Focus ST, the Mustang GT 5.0, and the new Eco-boost engines.  He seemed very knowledgable on these topics,  so i got the feeling he was competent at giving accurate info on cars he sells.  The dealership was clean, and had a nice waiting area.  As stated above, this was the best dealer visit ive ever had, but i hate dealerships in general, so in MY opinion, there were much more pleasant ways to spend a saturday morning, but this was the best of my experiences at dealerships.  The experience was far from horrible though, and they did get me in and out a lot faster than i had anticipated.

im a good hour drive from Maxwell Ford, so a repeat visit in the future wouldn't be ideal for me unless they had a specific car or the best price, but if those circumstances did present themselves, i would not hesitate to make the drive up to do business with them again, and i would encourage anyone in the Austin area to pay them a visit.

The salesman who i dealt with is named Edgar Cruz.  I believe him to be a good salesman, not because its his job, but because he seemed to be a genuinely nice guy.  He never gave me the impression he was trying to sell me something, but rather followed me along the process, and kindly opened the doors to help me get to where i wanted to go with my car purchase.  I would definitely recommend Mr. Cruz. ",4.8

531,"September 12, 2012","	On Saturday, June 23, 2012 I contacted Maxwell Ford at 5000 S IH 35 regarding a pre-owned Silver, 2008 Dodge Avenger SXT with approximately 82,000 miles, list price $10,995 that I had located on their website. Upon confirming the vehicle was still available and upon completion of my research (Edmunds, CarFax etc), I proceeded to drive over to Maxwell Ford to have a look at the car. I was greeted by my Salesman, Charles Lewis. We began the usual rigmarole and I advised I was only looking and not in a rush to purchase that moment (as I had been shopping around for a few weeks prior and quite frankly had my guard up by this time.) I looked the vehicle over and made arrangements to return later that day when my boyfriend was off work to test drive the vehicle together. As planned, my boyfriend and I returned to the dealer to test drive the vehicle which at that time, all tested out okay. I was told new tires and front brakes were put on the vehicle (an approximate $1,000.00 cost to the dealer) and that it was in excellent condition (other than the dent and detailing service that had not been completed as it was pulled out of the shop for us to look at). After going back and forth with Charles and the General Sales Manager, Steve Cargo (who was not extremely helpful and borderline rude) they allowed us to take the vehicle for the weekend to drive, I’m assuming to promote the sale. After an approximate 20 minute drive, I began to feel a knocking in my steering while driving on a completely smooth straight road. I then began to here a rattling sound coming from the steering column area. My boyfriend drove the vehicle the next day and was also able to reproduce the knocking feeling and rattling sound.
	After work on Monday, June the 25th before returning to the dealer, we had a trusted certified mechanic inspect the vehicle who confirmed my concerns as well as finding a few others upon a closer inspection. We found the following items: Excessive knocking/rattling in steering, which he also felt was coming from the steering shaft area, poorly machined/rutted front rotors (which were supposedly included in the front brake job) as well as an annoying brake squeal (not sure from front or rear), a coolant leak, an oil leak (although we weren’t completely able to pin point from where as it was dirty; oil pan area) inoperative 3rd brake light on trunk lid, inoperative windshield washer (one hose was tucked up into the hood of the vehicle instead of connected as it should have been), low hanging front bumper, and a pushed in driver’s side AC vent. I compiled a typed list of theses issues and presented it to Charles who then brought in the Sales Manager, Scott Robinson. Charles and Scott were both adamant that the majority of my concerns couldn’t be valid as the vehicle was inspected by their “Master Technicians” and even proceeded to mark of what he felt could not have been problems (brakes and oil leak). Scott agreed to come out and check the vehicle over with us. He agreed to address all of the concerns on our list minus providing an owner’s manual and spare tire. He agreed the steering needed be fixed by what I had told him and that the brake light was a safety concern (his words). We then went back inside and continued our negotiations. Based on my research and the mileage, I felt the vehicle was a little overpriced to begin with, but had previously been told by Mr. Steve Cargo that the price was non-negotiable as the internet pricing was set for a “no haggle experience”. I expressed that I would not be interested in purchasing the vehicle without all the listed items being fixed and that I would also like to be provided all RO’s and parts warranties for the repairs made. Scott stated that they would agree to fix these issues if I signed a paper agreeing to purchase the vehicle. I agreed but stated that I was doing so in good faith that these repairs would be completed and that I did not feel comfortable signing for the purchase of the vehicle until it was completely repaired. He would not agree to repair the vehicle previous to me purchasing it but stated that by him signing the paper it bound them to make the repairs and if repairs were not made it would be “a breach of our agreement and the contract would be null and void” (his exact words). By this time it was once again late in the evening so we agreed to “sleep on it” and come back the next day. On June 26th, 2012 we were told we got a bit better interest rate that we anticipated and the vehicle purchase price had changed to $10,380. We completed all the paper work and left with the vehicle that afternoon. Apparently the paper work had been drawn up on the 25th because that is when everything is dated; however we did not sign or leave with the vehicle until Tuesday the 26th. 
	On Monday, July 2, 2012 I dropped the vehicle off for repairs to be made and was provided a loaner vehicle. On Tuesday, July 10, 2012 I returned to the dealership to pick the vehicle up. I inquired on the work that was done and was told the body work was completed at Maxwell and the car was then sent to a 3rd party, Leonard’s Garage at 4401 South 1st Street, Austin, (512) 445-2892. I was told they corrected the knocking/rattling by lubing the steering shaft because it was “bone dry” and had also replaced the batter due to a check engine light that had come on while in their possession. When asked whether the 3rd brake light, rotors, coolant leak, oil leak and AC vent had been addressed I was told they were unsure and had to go speak with the Sales Manager and the man in charge of the service department. Upon his return, I find out none of these issues were addressed and was asked to leave the vehicle with them once more. They filled my loaner up with gas (because they wanted to “keep me happy” they said) and sent me on my way. Two days later, Thursday, July 12, 2012 I was called to pick the vehicle back up. Again, I Charles asked if everything had been addressed and was told he “believed so”. As I get down the road from the dealership, the steering starts knocking and rattling and as I suspected, the 3rd brake light was still inoperative and the coolant leak or oil leaks had not corrected much less checked, not to mention the grease handprints on my visor and headliner. So basically, all they did was replace the AC vent in the two day period. 
	The following day, Friday, July 13th, 2012 I once again contacted both Scott Robinson and Charles Lewis and advised them the steering still was not corrected and my brake light was still inoperative and requested to be provided with documentation showing that the coolant system had been pressure tested as well as the car being tested for oil leaks. I was told they would take the vehicle back and send it back to Leonard’s Garage to have the steering fixed, all the while somewhat ignoring my other requests. Monday, July 16th, I took the vehicle back in for the 3rd time along with another typed list of the remaining things that needed to be addressed. However, before taking the car to Maxwell, I drove around for 20 minutes to get the knocking going in the steering, contacted Jason at Leonard’s garage and took the vehicle by their shop to show them first hand what issue I was having. Jason sent me on a test drive with Brian who witnessed the rattling and knocking of the steering. I then took the car over to Maxwell with a near full tank of gas, dropped it off, and picked up my loaner (with a quarter tank of gas).  On Friday, July 20th, almost a month after purchasing my vehicle, I was told the vehicle was ready to be picked up. They had found a leak in the radiator causing the coolant leak; they found 2 small oil leaks but chose to make no repairs to them. Once again, as I leave the dealer with less than a quarter of a tank of gas, I find the 3rd brake light is still inoperative and the steering still knocks and rattles. I was pleased the coolant leak was repaired however I was quite disappointed to know they verified my concern of an oil leak but chose not to correct it even though they signed a paper saying they would do so. Needless to say, I was burnt out and put off calling them again until Monday the 23rd of July, 2012. I first contacted Scott Robinson and advised him that the steering issue had still not been corrected and I wanted to know what they were going to do to resolve this once and for all. Scott basically told me that repairs were not successful because “apparently there was no defective part”. I simply advised that if they did not stand behind our contractual agreement I would have to enlist the services of an attorney where he promptly cut me off and hung up in my face. I then contacted Charles Lewis who went on to say that with the age/mileage of this vehicle I can not expect it to be “showroom quality” and that I “may have to live with some rattles”.  Upon contacting Jason back at Leonard’s to discuss what their findings were and what repair was performed I was told the steering shaft had been lubed again, the same exact ineffective repair that was performed the first time. I then took the vehicle to South Point Dodge. After once again driving around for 20-30 minutes I took Service Advisor, Allan Becerra on a test drive. He too acknowledged the steering knock/rattle and advised I would need to leave the vehicle with them for diagnosis. I filled him in on the history and he stated he knew Steve Cargo personally and would contact him on his cell to see what they could do to help me out. When contacting Allan back, he advised they would be willing to look at it but was told that Maxwell would no longer provide me a loaner vehicle and there was no guarantee that they would cover the cost of repair.
A couple of weeks later, I contacted Jason at Leonard’s Garage to ask them to fax me the RO from the 2nd shaft lubing. He asked me how the steering was and I advised it was not corrected but due to the dealer’s unwillingness to fix it and provide me alternate transportation, I was taking other avenues. He told me that if I needed anything to let them know and that all they had to do was change out the part and it would fix it permanently. He also stated he would even contact the dealership to see what they could do to help…of course I never heard back from him or Maxwell Ford. 
The vehicle has still not been repaired as I do not feel I should have to claim this on my extended warranty I purchased and pay the $100 deductible for an issue the dealer should have corrected in the 16 days they had it. I did however correct the small brake light issue by purchasing a $5 bulb from Autozone, yet another thing they could have easily done. My brakes still squeal on every stop and the steering has actually gotten worse; it now makes noises on turns and makes a horrible groaning noise when turning the wheel from left to right while cold and in park. The steering rattle sounds like it is going to fall apart in your hands.  Also, intermittently, when turning with the blinker on and straightening back out, the opposite blinker will come on for a couple of seconds as if something is catching on the blinker arm.
I feel the actions taken by Maxwell Ford were deceptive and they completely and knowingly breached our contract. I have spent much time, money and gas attempting to resolve these few little issue that, had they been handled with care and urgency could have been corrected on the first attempt not to mention they sold a vehicle that really was not yet in the condition to be sold. Unfortunately for them, they sold it to someone who is not completely stupid or they would have been totally off the hook. I sure they bargained on someone buying “as is” and not being held accountable for the defects their “Master Technicians” conveniently missed.   This experience has left a bad taste and I will never do business with Maxwell Ford again – I would suggest the same to you!!

536,"July 25, 2012","The sales experience was very pleasant, Jeffery was very helpful in every aspect of the buying experience, He called while we were on our way to the dealership to give better directions than my GPS unit. This was a cash deal so very little paperwork was required.
Overall My wife and I thought this was one of the most pleasant car buying experiences we have had",5.0
537,"January 30, 2012","We were greeted by a salesman in the lot, we were looking at a BMW 330i they had.  Firstly it was marked on the car at 4000 dollars more than they had it listed on the internet, so our guard was up at the start.  The car was nice and in good shape, so we asked to drive it.  The salesman went in to get a dealer plate, unknown to us, some of his other customers had popped in.  He left us waiting in the showroom for 20 minutes while he attended to people that came after us, my wife and I were so disgusted that we walked out.  I called the sales manager to report what happened, he was unavailable.  I have as of yet, never received a phone call nor an apology for our unprofessional treatment.  
-THE SUM UP-
The salesman we dealt with needs to learn proper etiquette, this seems consistent all the way up the ladder.  I would rather pay 2000 dollars more for a car if the sales process was professional and honest.",1.5
538,"January 19, 2012","We had an absolutely wonderful experience with this dealership and particularly with sales associate, Jemma Kechichian.  She was a pleasure to work with and after driving foreign cars for 20 years, I am back to Ford, in no small part due to her excellent customer service.  The 2012 Ford Focus is proving to be an amazing car and I thank her for her knowledge and great customer care. She found us exactly what we were looking for at the best possible price - we really trust her.  Great experience for us! ",5.0
539,"December 12, 2011","Avoid this dealer at all costs, both sales and service! This IS NOT a Nyle Maxwell dealer, it is owned by investment group(A1 Auto) and their quality and customer service absolutely suck. I purchased a $50000+ truck from them at their recommendation for towing and all was fine until I towed with it! The dealer(sales staff) knew EXACTLY what I was towing and promised I'd be fine. 1st time out towing and the truck starts falling apart, collapsed leaf springs and a horrible vibration while towing. I took the truck back for repairs and this is when the BS started. The service dept tried blaming me for all the issues w/ the truck, stating I overloaded it, even though it was rated for MUCH heavier by Ford. They even tried to void my warranty which FoMoCo took care of. The only HONEST person at this dealer was the mechanic working on my truck, and after the General Manager BILL SCOTT got involved, this mechanic suddenly changed his story and said the truck was fine. It's funny how your mind gets changed when your job is on the line. Bill Scott is the head of all of the problems with this dealer. I have many saved emails to share showing what a low class crook this man is. All of his employees act like him, a used car salesman, crook that only wants to make a buck and then he is DONE with you, his customer! Ford Motor company has had so many complaints on this dealer that they offered me a free extended bumper/bumper warranty for having so many problems at the dealership level. They(Ford Mo Co) also contacted another dealer and set up service for me and recommended I stay away from Maxwell Ford. Live and learn...",1.2
540,"November 27, 2011","Very good customer service - answered our questions, returned our calls in a timely manner...stayed late to close the deal.  We would definitely used Maxwell Ford again and also Jeff Lynch who was our salesman.  They were not pushy.",4.8
541,"September 09, 2011","Absolutely HORRIBLE experience! I was looking to purchase a 2011 Escape or a 2012 Escape. I spent nearly two hours looking at the available cars on Thursday 9/8/2011 at Maxwell Ford. I indicated my desires but basically located the cars I liked on my own as the dealer who finally approached myself and my parents in the lot was Charles Lewis and he could not answer questions I had (although I had already done my research and knew what I was looking for)and when I asked to see inside some of the vehicles, he stated he would have to go get keys but never did! I narrowed down my selection to two vehicles (a 2011 & a 2012). I went inside with Charles as my father and I indicated we wanted quotes for both of the vehicles I selected for 48 and 60 month terms. I was looking for a deal! I was inside for over an hour while Charles went back and fourth from his desk to the front counter and finally came back with a generic quote form and tried to tell me to lease to meet my terms. I told him no that I wanted to purchase at which time I completed a credit application. 20 minutes later Charles returns and hand writes my asked for terms on the back of my initial info. sheet and tells me to sign this to purchase the vehicle today. I told him no and indicated I would be looking elsewhere and left. The entire time I was at Maxwell Ford I was never approached by a manager or any other sales persons to help. My 65+ year old parents walked around the lot then sat in the car. It appeared to me that Mr. Lewis or anyone else was actually interested in selling me a car. I told him he had my number and call if he got a deal and quote together. I then requested internet quotes from Maxwell Ford and Leif Johnson Ford for the cars I was interested in. Leif Johnson contacted me by phone and email immediately and were able to give me quotes over the phone and with follow-up emails. They were extremely professional. I got a GENERIC email from Charles saying that he spoke to his manager and could meet my terms for purchase on the 2012 (although I had indicated interest in the 2011 & 2012) but did NOT give an actual quote. I still had NOT received a quote as I had asked for in the first place!!! I never had any other follow-up from Maxwell Ford. I took a chance after doing further research that evening and called Maxwell Ford, spoke to Charles and stated that if the 2011 Escape I was interested in was still available I would be in at 9am the next day to purchase it if he indeed to could meet or match (Leif Johnson Ford's)terms as Maxwell had the color car and options I wanted. Charles indicated that the car was available and he would be available at 9am Friday to work out the deal. I was there at 9am sharp and Charles finally met with me at 9:15am after his meeting ""upstairs"". The window washer was more friendly and helpful than Charles was this morning. The first thing I asked Charles was if the car was available as my father and I could NOT locate it in the lot. Charles had me go to his desk area and he began to ramble on that I was wrong and the car I wanted was the 2012 Escape 4-cyl. at which time I presented him with the sticker price of the car I wanted from online ( and the car he actually showed me the inside of because it was unlocked on the lot!) and told him that was the car I wanted and no other. He would NOT listen to me and when I presented him with the quote from Leif Johnson he told me that was for LEASE!!! Again, NOT listening to me nor reading the information I handed him!!! After another 10 minutes, Charles returned from the front desk, told me that car was sold and that he had in fact shown me a 2012 (NOT the 2011) and proceeded to speak to me like I was mistaken and he said ""I'm confused!"" What's confusing about, ""This is the car I want, Is it still available?"" Yes or No???? I got up and walked out informing him I would take my money and my business to someone who wants it!!! The entire experience upset me and I was even more upset when I received a call from Charles at 10am which states again, I was mistaken in the car I wanted!!! I have told every person who will listen today what a horrible experience I had at Maxwell Ford. I do NOT appreciate Maxwell Ford allowing Charles to contact me and yet another Sales person named Mike who left a voicemail stating he wants to work a deal! Where was Mike or the manager when I was on property trying to buy a car! If you truly wanted my business, perhaps you should have stuck with the Ford standards and showed me you cared by showing me the service department, talking about options, details of warranties, a greeting from the manager or even simply opening up the cars to show me the insides! (yes, I am very familier with Ford's standards as my parents just purchased an Explorer last year) They were lucky because they had a good experience at Lewisville Country Ford. I will be taking my money & business elsewhere and I would NOT like to be contacted by Maxwell Ford ever again! Perhaps if they were serious customer service driven professionals, they would have had a manager call me or at least have the un-trained and impersonal Mr. Lewis apologize for accusing me of being WRONG!!!! Anyone wanting to buy a new car, don't waste your time....Try Leif Johnson Ford, they call you back, answer your questions, are patient and willing to work with getting you the right car that YOU WANT!!! This horrible experience has caused me to even re-think my decision about buying a Ford!!! ",1.4
542,"August 31, 2011","We contacted Maxwell through their web special site and were called by Jemma Kechichian. We were told the Escape we wanted was still available, however another person was present at the dealership with another salesman, dealing on the same vehicle.

Before we left to go to the dealership the other interested party bought the vehicle. Jemma was able to offer us another Escape, at the same price, but better equipped and that we liked even more. 

We explained our situation as retirees and were shown several options for financing and Jemma came up with a financing solution that worked for our specific requirements and saved us money.

Jemma was professional, courteous, knowledgeable, friendly and did not pressure us in any way. 

This was the most pleasant experience we've ever had buying a car.

He was willing to work with us on the price and made the deal feel very relaxed.  Jeff was professional and did not push us into a used car. He communicated with us very well throughout the sales process and then all the paperwork.  We bought a 2008 Subaru.  Shoppers should not go to a dealer until they know competitive used auto prices and then be patient and take advantage of ""Internet prices"".  I'll go back and see if Jeff can help us when we need another car.",4.8
544,"July 05, 2011","Jemma was great to work with, very prompt & very courtesy.
  
When she didn’t hear from me for a while she made contact but without pressure or strong arm tactics.
 
She had things ready when promised, went over all the details and left me smiling as I drove away in my new truck.
 
She further made a follow up call to make sure all was well and I was satisfied. She is A-1 !!!!

What more could I ask for?

I will go back again!

545,"June 30, 2011","Just purchased a new F150 at Maxwell using their internet quote service.  I had done a lot of research up front, new what I wanted and had a good idea of what price I was willing to pay.  

I contacted over 7 dealers and Jemma at Maxwell was the only one who took a look at what I wanted, found me the truck I wanted and gave me a good price straight up. At the dealership, no surprises or strong arm tactics from the sales manager or finance department just a smooth transaction with most of the time spent with Jemma educating me on all the features of my new vehicle.  

I was really impressed with how smoothly the whole transaction went and walked away with what everybody wants,an honest deal that is a 'win-win'.

Great experience at Maxwell.  Stellar performance by Jemma and the entire Maxwell crew.

He was very accessible and went above and beyond to make us feel confident that we were getting the best deal on our 2010 Ford Flex possible.  He was very informed and went out of his way to stay late (after closing) to close the deal- since we had drove in from out of town.  He was not in the least pushy, as we found most salesmen to be, and really let the deal speak for itself.  We left the dealership that night feeling very confident, with no doubts in our mind, that we made the best decision in purchasing from Jeff Lynch at Maxwell Ford in Austin.",4.8

Took my truck back 4 times already, missing work and two weeks without my truck.  They've installed parts I didn't need and when I point that out, they tell me I did need them.  They put the wrong parts and tell me to bring it back, and they'll ""put the correct parts on at no cost to you.""  Gee thanks!

548,"November 22, 2010","Issue #1
On 10/2009 I brought my Mustang in for an oil change and was told I had an oil leak in my rear main seal. I was never given a quote to fix this issue, and it took me several times calling the dealership to finally find out how much it would be to fix the rear main seal. Now after that time I did start to notice a small puddle under my car from time to time, I was told this was a very bad leak and being an oil leak I was checking my oil every day. I never saw a change in the level and it seemed to be holding its oil.

Issue #2
On 03/2010 I brought my Mustang back into the shop for its next oil change and asked the gentleman how long it would take to get my oil changed and if when it is up on the lift if they could show me this rear main seal leak. I was told it would only be 20-30 minutes to change the oil and they would call me when they were done so I could look at this leak. An hour and a half went by and my car was still not ready and when I finally asked when my car would be ready to be looked at, they took me out to the shop at that time to look at it.

Now there was fluid by the rear main seal and when I touched it I noticed it was transmission fluid not oil. When I went to check out and noticed the price of the oil change was really low, I asked what oil they used they said all climate oil. This really upset me because the notes when they changed the oil stated full synthetic, and that is what I have been using in my Mustang. The dealership did offer to put the correct oil in my car, but I did not have anymore time to waste at the dealership, I had to get back to work. Later that night I purchased oil and an oil filter and changed the oil myself back to full synthetic, and I dropped the transmission pan cleaned off the transmission gasket (as they are reusable) and changed the transmission filter and to this day I have not had a leak in my Mustang.


Issue #3
On 10/2010 I took my Explorer to Maxwell Collision Center in the Maxwell dealership because my Explorer had been rear ended. I was dealing with Sue Rodriguez, who I must say was such a pleasure to work with, and made my experience with the collision center the best I have ever had. I asked Sue to please take my Explorer to the service department to have the oil changed that I had a free one with my Ford Loyalty card. I know the oil change was completed, but I was unsure if they did the multi-point inspection. 

After taking possession of my Explorer on 11/12/2010 and driving it less than 100 miles on 11/20/2010 at 5:45 pm I noticed when I was driving when I hit the breaks it was pulling to the right and I started to hear noise coming from the front driver tire. I purchased new break pads and replaced them the next morning to find the front driver inside break pad was metal to metal (attached picture of the pads) and the other front pads were worn down so low that they were almost metal to metal. 

When I received my Explorer I never got a copy of the oil change bill or the multi point inspection. This really scares me because I could have really messed up my break system causing me hundreds of dollars out of pocket, or even worse getting into an accident, and not just an accident but an accident that could have caused a fatality, due to Maxwell Ford’s negligence.  

On 11/22/2010 @ 9:20 am I called the dealership to ask them to please fax me a copy of the multi-point inspection, as well as the service invoice. Upon reviewing the multi-point inspection I found that they did know about the break pads and no one from the dealership informed me of the bad state they were in. Further review of the multi –point inspection I found as well they marked my Steering, steering linkage, and ball joins required immediate attention. This again is another issue I was not informed on.

After reading the multi-point inspection I called Maxwell Ford collision center and spoke with Sue Rodriguez and asked her if she ever received a copy of the multi-point inspection or if they informed her of the bad condition of my breaks, or steering, steering linkage, and ball joints. Sue had informed me no one from service told her of the issues with my truck, and if they would have she would have called me right away. 

I called and spoke with Kyle in the service department and I was told he was a new service manager for Maxwell Ford and informed him of all my concerns as listed above. As I was speaking with Kyle I must say I did not feel he addressed this issue with the urgency that it needed and to be honest to me it felt like he did not care about my concerns at all. Kyle did listen to me, but when I was speaking with Sue it seemed like she was more upset that I was put back into my Explorer and no one from the service department told her of the issues with my Explorer. At this point Kyle took my contact information and told me he would have Jim Ramsey call me back and slammed the phone down.

I have yet to hear from Jim Ramsey!!!

549,"November 05, 2010",I purchased my vehicle and was asked to return to redo the contracts several weeks later because the financing had some problems and fell through.  The deal I made did not go as discussed with the finance manager and I would recommend that potential customers shop around before committing to this dealership.

Two things should have tipped me off and I was stupid enough not to stop right then:  Unwilling to give me a price over the phone, and then when I got there, they pulled out the 4-square scam.  After 4 hours, they wore me down and I was ready to make a deal - but it just didn't feel right - they were really scamming me on the trade-in and the financing.  Just about then a salesman from Covert gave me a call and over the phone offered me a much better deal. I took off when to the other dealership bought the vehicle and got much better financing.
Just to be fair - it seemed to me that Clem, the salesman, was a fairly nice fellow.  I think the corrupt behavior was more in the management layers of the dealership.",1.8

It was late (after 8 pm on a Saturday), so I was told that they would contact me on Monday to finalize deal.  I called and emailed several times with no response.  This is a total lack of accountability and professionalism that is unacceptable.  I purchased my current vehicle from Maxwell and had it serviced there, and I did not expect to encounter such poor customer service.  I definately deserved a return phone call even if they were unable to follow through with the deal that was negotiated.  I even sent an email to management and did not receive a response.  It has been a week now, so there is no doubt that I will not be receiving a return phone call or response to my email messages.

Although the other one was not fixed, it was never broken and still works.  They wanted to charge me an extra $300 for something that was not broken.
The second time (within 2 weeks), my car was not accelerating.  I took it into the shop and it was ""diagnosed"" as having no compression in one of the motors cylinders.  I was told that I had to either have the engine opened or the whole engine replaced (2004 Ford Explorer) at a cost of $4-6 thousand dollars.  I called a recommended shop and the mechanic told me over the phone that it sounded like a broken $8 exhaust spring valve, which it turned out to be.  Total cost was less than $600.

Other dealerships offer the vehicle at list price (already a big profit for the dealership) and don't seem to need to price gouge/take advantage of their customers.   They will likely make their $2000 on someone, but it won't be me.  Moreover, another dealership will earn my money for this vehicle and my future business.  My recommendation to anyone looking for a new car is to try another dealer in/around town.",1.5
