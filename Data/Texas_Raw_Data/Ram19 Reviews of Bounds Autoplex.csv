0,"June 05, 2017","We have bought our last several cars from Bounds. Knowing the family gave us confidence we were in good hands. Anytime there seemed to be a glitch, it was quickly tended to and corrected. All seven cars were well priced and we got good trades for our old cars. My husband died and I am about to embark on a new car search. Even though I now live in the Hill Country, I'm probably going back to Bounds. I know I can trust them and they will do me right. ",4.2
1,"January 21, 2016","I brought my car in for transmission work. After 3wks and multiple phone calls I finally was told I needed a new transmission. They cut me a deal on labor from $105-$95. Bad part is I should have let them charge me $105. They charged me 10hrs labor for a job that everyone else in the industry charges 8hrs or less. $1400 for the transmission which they marked up over $600. Wow!! Finally after 6wks I got my car back and they had the nerve to ask if I wanted them to do some other work. If your vehicle is not in for warranty work, you better get pricing up front and do a little research before you say O.K. First and Last time I use them. Almost forgot, the core price they quoted was not the truth either.",1.8
2,"March 05, 2015","I bought a new dodge truck from bounds about 12 months ago. I received a coupon in the mail for oil change tire rotation and normal inspection. The coupon said $29.95  so I took it in and they said It needed a new air filter and like a dummy I said replace it. when I got to pay for it they said I owed  almost $170.00  they said they forgot about the coupon  and corrected it to $80.dollars  I was told the new air filter was $35dollars. which seems awful high. I paid the 80 dollars. I will never buy anything from this dealership ever again, you have lost a customer. also I checked for air filter prices around town and the very best filter was only $18 . if you go to this dealership. beware.

3,"February 11, 2015","The dealership owner refuses to honor the deal made by the salesman. Part of the truck purchase was to have a spray in bed liner done by a local shop, the dealer agreed to have it done as part of the truck sale. Now the  deal is done and they are claiming they lost money on the deal, they will not do the spray in liner . It's not my fault the salesman was an incompetent person, he agreed to the terms, even the business manager signed off on the deal.  The owner refuses to honor their commitment. They are dishonest and very rude. The sales manager even hung up on me and the salesman refuses to take my calls. They kept calling me when they wanted to make a sale, now they have obligations to fill and will not honor their deal. Jan Beverly was very rude and didn't care if I was a satisfied customer or not. She had absolutely no regard for customer service. This is a very dishonest and disrespectful dealership. One thing about being a bad business in a small town, word travels fast. Integrity and honesty should be at the forefront of their business and treating the customer fairly and honestly. This dealership does not do that at any level. It is a very poor way to do business and keep repeat customers.",1.0

5,"August 27, 2012","Looked for car on internet.  Received a call from Meagan. She was very helpful, checked out all options on the car.  Set up an appointment to go to the dealership. Customer service was excellent from walking in the door to leaving with my new car.  Price was right both on new car and trade.  Great, friendly, no pressure sales person.",5.0
6,"June 29, 2012",Mr. Keller went out of his way to find the car I wanted. He even took the time to come to my home and look at my trade in. ,4.6
7,"May 02, 2012","My wife and I have nothing but praise for the used car sales staff at Bounds Autoplex, Livingston, Texas.  Jan, Billy and Susan answered our questions thoroughly through every step of the purchase. I’ve never had a more pleasant experience purchasing an automobile. The entire process from test drive to final purchase took less than 3.5 hours.  I would be remised if I didn’t mention Johnny who provided background information on the 2007 Chrysler Aspen and added to our decision to purchase the auto.

8,"March 15, 2012","I went into Bonds Autoplex in Livingston looking for a new 2012 Black Camaro. D.L. did a great job at finding me the Camaro of my dreams. I told him exactly what I wanted and he was able to find me the perfect Camaro that met all of my requirements. Not only did he find my car, but did so in a timely manner with a great price I couldn't pass up. Thank you D.L. and Bonds Autoplex for such a great car buying experience!",5.0
9,"March 14, 2012","Ordered a new Sierra SLT 2500 from Bounds.  Everyone was extremely nice from the first moment I walked in the dealership.  Rocky and David were both wonderful to work with on the new car but I actually enjoyed shooting the breeze with them even more.

I chose Bounds after visiting several other dealerships and not getting the same warm reception.

My next vehicle will definitely be bought at Bounds, and I highly recommend that anyone in the surrounding area drive to Livingston, Texas and visit Bounds.",5.0
10,"March 12, 2012","My wife wanted to get an SUV style vehicle to replace her sedan. I researched numerous SUV style vehicles of other makes and models. We narrowed our choice down to the GMC Terrain. I then researched for a Terrain with the minimum options we wanted on it. We located one in Livingston, Texas. I called Jan Beverly tosee if it was stillon the lot, and it was. This was on a Friday. I told her we would call Saturday at lunct to see if it was still there. We got there Saturday afternoonaround 3:30pm. Met with Jan who introduced us to Ashley Lanier. From there Ashley showed us the vehicle andlet us test drive it. It was just thevehicle we had been searching for. Ashley started the process of making the vehicle ours. She was very thourough and competent with our paperwork. She even offered us a refreshment will we completed thepaperwork. From there we completed the peperwork with the finance personnel. I was really impressed on the effeciency of everything. Onceit was now ours to driveoff the lot, Ashley had the vehicle prepped and washed and ready to go over thecontrols and options on the vehicle with my wife. She was very thoourogh and only went as fast as to where Wanita understood the controls and options. Ashley stayed well past the closing hours to ensure to answer questions from Wanita and was comfortable with the contorls.  This definitely shows that Ashley is dedicated to Customer Satisfaction. In the future I will remember Bounds Autoplex for any new car purchases....

11,"March 09, 2012","I was in the marked for a change in transportation and needed a 4-door truck to replace my 2-door Jeep Wrangler.  My intent was to better accommodate my two daughters (< 5 Y/O) and to get better gas mileage.  Having done some research online, I preferred a late-model Toyota Tacoma for those considerations and for its safety rating.
While traveling home to Jasper, TX from Houston, TX, I noticed Bounds Autoplex at about the midway point of my journey in Livingston, TX and decided to peruse their inventory.  This was my first physical attempt to shop for a truck, of which I expected to be many.  The truck that I bought that day, a 2008 Chevrolet Colorado, offered everything I was looking for and impressed me as a good deal, given the price and low mileage.
Johnny Barrera was very friendly and accommodating, giving me little pressure during the process of making the sale.  He got me an acceptable offer on the trade-in value for my Jeep and within about 2 hours of my driving onto the lot, we had completed the sale.
The dealership was good enough to let me drive the truck home that day (2-hours one-way) and to return the title for my Jeep via mail instead of having to make the round trip to do so.
Two weeks after the sale, Johnny was good enough to purchase a missing cup holder for the back bench seat with his own funds and to personally replace a non-functioning reverse light.  He has provided incomparable service and I have subsequently recommended him to my father, who is also in the market for a vehicle.",5.0

Everyone was more than just knowledgable and helpful, they were honest and very supportive of their military service members That's what sealed the deal for us. Thanks for the great experience and a good looking merchandise ;)

14,"January 19, 2012",We were involved is a bad wreck out of town and 350 miles away from home. We needed to replace our 2007 Suburban quickly. We shopped the Houston area Dealers but chose to get our replacement from Bounds. The people were straightforward with not  only the price but scheduling the pickup of the new vehicle. I would highly recommend that you check this dealer out when you are in the market for a new or used car. I will be for future purchases.  ,5.0
15,"January 16, 2012","When my husband told me we would be driving to Livingston to buy a car I thought he had gone crazy. What could Livingston have that Richmond doesn't. Well I soon found out. Our experience was nothing but good. Upon arrival we got nothing but kindness and consideration for our drive out there. Ashley began our process and was there until the very end. I have an 18 month old son and he was so happy to be able to walk around and see all the people. Everyone was so nice and helpful to us. I felt like we were at a friend's house, not a auto dealership. 

Would I recommend Bound Autoplex...yes, most definetly. I gave the overall experience a 4 only because I heard an older gentleman make a comment about an older Hispanic woman behind her back that I thought was a little offensive. Nothing horrible, just a little snyde. 

Overall we had a good experience with fair pricing. We would drive out there again if we found something we were looking for way out in Livingston. ",4.6
16,"January 14, 2012","I felt everyone I dealt with was very friendly. I was also very impressed with how honest and knowledgable Ashley Lanier was. When I left to go think about seriously buying a car... I knew I would go back to her, she made it a very easygoing experience for me! Everyone was really a pleasure to deal with! And that's the honest truth!!",5.0
17,"December 30, 2011","This dealership was fantastic.  The employees were super easy to work with.  They made the buying experience very  pleasant.

This is the way your product (Chevrolet) should be represented- a super product sold by professional people.  ",5.0
18,"October 20, 2011",I have bought three Dodge vehicles from Bounds. They have always been very friendly and helpful in both sales and service. I have my vehicles serviced at Bounds and have found the service department to be very professional and helpful. I would highly recommend this dealer.  ,5.0
