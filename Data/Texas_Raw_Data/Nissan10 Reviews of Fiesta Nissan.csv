0,"May 07, 2020","I called the dealer because of a recall notice we received in the mail. I spoke with Linda Perez on 5/4, and was given an appt for the next day 5/5. Upon arriving Linda immediately took care of my vehicles need with the recall notice and also said that it was time for an oil change. Shuttle brought me home and my vehicle was ready in a timely manner. Thanks Linda. Excellent service!",5.0

7,"November 16, 2018",I went to get the tires checked because one of them was making a noise. The doors were still open so I drove in. I told Linda the lady working that the tires needed to be checked. She got someone to put air. I asked if there was anything wrong she said itâ€™s the weather!! In the morning my tire was flat. I put enough air to get me to the dealership where I dropped it off. I called back and told Linda that I went to get it checked to avoid a flat. She would not stop talking and making excuses. Every time I tried to say something she would not let me speak. I thanked her n told her it was pointless to say anything n she said yeah. I hung up! Not going back there again! I will stick to the Nissan on Jackson Rd.,1.2

9,"June 13, 2018","After 5 calls and promised me to call me back from my previous dealer Sevice shop to help me fix  the problems with my car , I decide to go here Fiesta Nissan, and as soon as got there Mr Albert helped me right away he took the ball they dropped, they check my carâ€™s problem, order the parts and fixed it, and also Iâ€™m feel more grateful because that weekend I had to leave on a vacation trip and if my car it wouldnâ€™t be ready everything would be ruined.
Thank you so much Mr Albert.",5.0
