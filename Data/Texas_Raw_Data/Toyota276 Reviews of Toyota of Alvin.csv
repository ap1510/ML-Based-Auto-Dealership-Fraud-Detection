He was ready with the car when we arrived since we called ahead to see the vehicle. He was very pleasant and patient while we made a decision! See Austin for your next vehicle!  Mary F.",4.0
1,"May 21, 2020","Just received a used car I bought from out of state. I worked with Al Ruiz as the sales guy, and it took basically two calls to agree to a sales price (me calling in an offer, and him reasonably countering).  I had 4 dealers at the time I was trying to buy from similar car and they would basically laugh at my offers, not even considering (bs about reasonable price already). No pressure during the sale from Al, only courtesy and respect from him. I have not come across a single salesperson in my car buying history who was as nice as he was.  I might (no, i WAS) probably more rude to him due to the history of the typical salesperson one thinks of, and Al is far from it.  Big thanks to him and his management for working on the sale.  Even shipping department was quick to follow up once the car was in my driveway to make sure it was to my satisfaction.  This remote buying could have been a horrible experience, but i was as happy as a kid when it arrived yesterday. Cheers Al!  
PS: in typical fashion, 3 of those dealers have contacted me in the last three days wanting to negotiate... Too late buddy...",5.0
2,"May 11, 2020","I could repeat all the things everyone else says about what con men these people are, but I won't bother.  Just don't be fooled by the occasional glowing 5.0 review here.  Those have to be fake.  Nobody could possibly find anything legitimate good to say about this dealership.  This is the worst place, and the most dishonest people I have ever been to and tried to buy a car from.  When they were under the previous owners, it was a good place, but not anymore.  ",1.0
3,"April 22, 2020",We needed a Cash car for my daughter and found one online. The salesman called me and made an appointment to look at the car. We drove an hour to get there. The car wasn't even there. It was at a repair shop then they tried to sell us cars we were not interested in at all. BiG BiG disappointment. Don't come here I got the feeling they do a lot of bait and switch tactics. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL. ,1.0

They quote you a low price, then when it's time to sign the contract, they distract you from seeing the insanely high final cost.
They specialize in taking advantage of women that are not automobile and paperwork savvy.",1.0

9,"February 22, 2020",They really scammed my mom out of her paid off car when she traded it for a Tacoma. The Tacoma was supposedly being sold for 31k then minus 11k for her trade in. But somehow when she got her payment notice a month later it showed the pay off at 45k. So they really screwed her and then stole her car. ,1.0

12,"October 01, 2019","I have nothing good to say about this dealership from sales, to finance, to service and customer service. I bought a 2019 Toyota Sienna SE in January. I dealt with Cowboy as my salesman and he refused to give me the discounts the dealership gave me for being a repeat customer. The car I wanted they did not have in stock and had to get it from another dealership. Finance refused to give me a copy of the forms I signed that first day and made me put my $10,000. Down that night with no receipt when they got the car in days later a second finance man waited on me and added extra charges on to my financing. When I drove home and looked at the paperwork I saw I did not get my discounts and even worse that is not the car I agreed on the 1st day. CalledCowboy immediately when I got home after picking up my car and Customer service too many times to count never a reply after they told me they would check into it and get back with me. Went back for service and complained in person to Cowboy and finance and they said sorry we can’t help you your paperwork has gone into storage. Cowboy assured me he would get a copy and send it to me. I have never heard a word from them to this day. October 1,2019. I hope that dealership folds up and saves someone else from getting cheated and lied to. Next Toyota I buy will be at Community Toyota in Baytown. I live in Channelview and should have never driven to Alvin looking for a better deal. One upset and taken advantage of lady. ",1.0
13,"September 25, 2019","The finance dept has made me lose all respect for this dealership. I cancelled my extended warranty 3 months ago and it has not been proved.  The loan company (mind you,  it's Toyota Financial) have told me on 2 separate time periods that they haven't received any paperwork.  Countless calls has been fruitless for the last 3 months. No one calls me back like they said they will.  I no longer trust anything they say, especially Adam Delagarza and Brian Perez.",2.6
14,"September 24, 2019","I had to take my 2019 Toyota Corolla for the 10,000 mile oil change and tire rotation which is free. When they came back and told me my car was ready and they went over my paperwork everything look good to them but I saw they had a check mark on the air filter line and I ask what is this and he said it was dirty and I ask to see the man in charge. Little did they know that the Saturday before I took it in I came to there place and brought a air filter which I put it in my car Sunday and the only place I drove my car was there to get a oil change. The guy look like he swallowed a cat. I told him I wonted to see the man in charge and they open my hood and took the air filter out and he said your right there nothing wrong with this. He said he was going to talk to the man in charge and said nothing to me just walked away    As long as my oil change is free but I wouldn’t take it there after  these people lying all the time ",1.0
15,"July 19, 2019","Take a trip with me if you will. I have been searching for a while for the perfect truck, I know exactly what I am looking for (Diesel,4x4, leather, etc.) I have searched high and low for a truck that has what I want and is within my price range. 

Enter, Toyota of Alvin. I pull onto the lot and a young man name Bruno pops up next to my drivers window like a chick-fil-a employee in the drive through line. ""Hello sir"" he says, ""how can I help you today?"" I give him the spill or what I am looking for and imagine my surprise when he says.. ""I have the truck for you"". He takes me to a white Dodge 2500 and says ""this is your truck"". (Its not black like the ad pictured, Im sure its a stock photo...)
 $41,000.00 dollar sticker and he says "" I can probably do 38"".  It has everything I want, low miles, great price, all the bells and whistles. 
At this point I am happier than a fat kid whose mom accidentally put 2 snack packs in his lunchbox. He proceeds to hand me the car fax, no wrecks, came to Houston mid August 2017 from Utah but he swears ""It didn't flood during Harvey."" I tell him I want to take the truck for 24 hours, take it to have it looked over by some people and have them look it over.  ""No problem"" he says as he hands me the keys.
I'm off in this nice truck and I love it, but as I am driving I notice it pulls kinda hard to the right.. Maybe it needs an alignment, no big deal. I pull up to have the truck looked at, and this is where it gets fun. One fender flare is aftermarket, put on with the wrong screws and the paint doesn't match 100%. There's over spray on the frame (which they tried to hide with black spray paint) the door trim, the bed liner all of it. The entire rear half of this truck has been repainted, you can even see inside the doors there are marks the body shop put on the doors to line the gaps.
 My buddy says ""the truck was wrecked 100% but it was put back together very well, the paint guy however was an amateur."" He feels confident in the truck none the less and says its structurally sound.. Its not looking good so I decide to make one more stop. 

I take it to a local upholstery shop and say, ""I want you to tell me if this truck has been flooded."" 10 minutes and some pretty decent waiting room coffee later, the tech asks me to walk back with him. Behind the door panels there is still water marks all the way around the truck! Under the carpet shows signs of flooding, even inside the glove-box he shows me evidence of water. He looks at me and says.. ""This truck was 100% flooded at one point in its life..""

I take it back to Toyota of Alvin and tell Bruno, ""this isn't the truck for me"". Its obviously been wrecked and had water in it"". I proceed to show him all of the evidence from my day trip. He tells me ""I am gonna make it right, I had no idea it was flooded."" I sit and wait at his desk for about 20 minutes and he walks back with a piece of paper with some numbers on it here's where it gets golden:

 The initial asking price of the truck was $41,000.00.
He proceeds to tell me they are going to take $1,000.00 dollars off because it got flooded. (I start laughing uncontrollably) He then proceeds to tell me that they did $6,000.00 worth of repairs to the vehicle that was not on the window sticker bringing the truck to $47,000.00 (minus the 1k for the flood damage 46,000.00 total)
They then offer me $5,000.00 less than Texas Direct Auto offered me for my car and tells me the out the door price for this truck is now over $50,000.00!!!

My laughter quickly turns to anger, and I tell this guy he has to be joking and that's the most dishonest approach to selling a vehicle I have ever seen. I asked him if the vehicle was never wrecked, why did it need almost 6k in repairs? His answer???? ""Well we had to change the oil and stuff"". I walk out to leave and notice that to top it all off, my car that I left there overnight now has a flat tire..... Interesting right??

I will never spend a dime with Toyota of Alvin, and I would advise all of you to take caution when looking at a car they are selling or a car that's even driven past their storefront. I have never met a more dishonest car dealership.",1.0
16,"July 17, 2019","Went to Toyota of Alvin for a used car for my granddaughter that was advertised on line for 9400.00 ish internet price. Got there and the sticker price was for 12,500 ish.  Took the car (2012 Honda Accord) for a test drive with Maurice. Proceeded to work on a deal. First Maurice stated that the cheapest it could get it to was 13,000 ish and I said WHAT? He stated the priced of 9400. did not include all the things they had to do to the car....WHAT? Then he left and came back and said ""Well you won't believe this but the car is being sold to someone elese this very minute and it is being sold to a special finance person and he is paying sticker price and is about to sign the bottom line and has never seen or driven the car. The only way I could beat him is to pay 12,500 plus! WHAT?! All I could say is have a nice day and we walked away stunned. I have been a loyal Toyota of Alvin customer for many years. That loyalty was severed last week. Shame on them. The car is still there for sale and advetised today for 8800. ish. WTH",1.0

18,"July 12, 2019","I'll cut the story short, but they basically tried 3 times to add into the math up to $10,000 in ""math errors"" to the bottom line.  Very clever about it, watch them closely, and add up everything before you sign anything.  Better yet, just go to an honest dealership - this ain't it.  I think I got out of there with a decent deal, but I think they would pick your pocket and rob their own mother if they got the chance.  ",1.5
19,"June 28, 2019",Overall a good dealership and my sales person Al Ruiz fought for the deal I wanted. His sales director Eric fought for my business and made it happen. I’m happy to be driving away in my new Tacoma and if you need a new Toyota go see Al or Eric. ,5.0
20,"June 25, 2019","You all, please, DO NOT go here. It was my first time purchasing a car and they were well aware of that. They took COMPLETE advantage of me in the 5-7 hours spent there. They verbally told me one deal, but ended up charging me for another. By the time the ""deal"" got down onto paper, there were so many numbers, words, writing, etc, that I was overwhelmed. Shame on me for not knowing better to read and ask every single question that I could think of. I was told I would be paying 46k drive out, but it turns out to be 51k. They used my positive equity (essentially MY MONEY) to work it into this ""deal"". Five months down the road, I find out that this 4Runner I bought OFF THE SHOW ROOM FLOOR had a leak on it from when THEY installed the roof rack that was already pre-existing when I purchased it. I took my truck back 3 times in the matter of a month and a half. That is another review of its own.

We purchased two cars in one night. My brother's car they were so sure had ""APEX Security"" and that they ""could not remove it"" from the package because we did not want/need it. So, the deal they made for his Camry, was that we would have APEX Security on it and about 40 miles (because that is what we test drove). My brother wanted red leather seats. They said they found a car identical to what we want/need. It would be in 3-5 business days. Sure! No problem... it came in early... WITH 358 MILES ON IT, a scratch on the bumper, and fingerprints all over. They had the audacity to try and have us drive off the lot with that. xxxx NO... The same car, a couple months later I need to locate it, I call them for the information to be able to set up APEX. The GM of Sales told me... ""oh, your car doesn't have APEX because you did not want it."" EXCUSE ME?! YOU ALL SOLD ME THE xxxx CAR WITH IT AND TOLD ME I COULD NOT REMOVE IT FROM THE PACKAGE. (Best believe NO money was taken off the deal when they delivered it WITHOUT the APEX). Y'all, I can go on and on with how TERRIBLE this place is. Literally, I will openly give you a call and let you know how ridiculous this place is. They are AWFUL and I will NEVER be back there for ANY reason.

Please, please, PLEASE, I am BEGGING YOU, do NOT go to Toyota of Alvin. There are SO MANY wonderful Toyota Dealerships, considering our location. DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE! DO NOT DO IT. 

Oh, and don't forget... my BRAND NEW truck off the SHOW ROOM FLOOR had a LEAK in it for FIVE months before it was discovered and ""fixed"". (Feel free to call me regarding that matter... it went up to Headquarters which was... meh, half help.) Seriously DO NOT GO THERE, Y'ALL! Take it as a warning. It is AWFUL THERE from up top down to the bottom. ",1.0
21,"June 19, 2019","We have had two terrible experiences while dealing with Toyota of Alvin and specifically their salesman who goes by the name of ""Cowboy"". We first went to Toyota of Alvin 3 1/2 years ago to lease a car. When working out the deal for the lease, we explained to them that we needed to included extra mileage since we would be using this car to commute to work. They increased the monthly payment which we understood. That lease was due this past February, so we returned to lease another. This is when everything went wrong. We were approached by Cowboy.  We told him that we were there to turn in our lease and to lease another. This is when his acting began. He was good... He told us that he could offer us a better deal if we bought a brand new car instead of leasing. If we bought a brand new car, they wouldn't charge us for a couple of scratches on the car that we were turning in and our payments would be lower. We decided to trust him and that was our first mistake. Two weeks later we get a bill from Toyota for the wear on the lease car, and the extra mileage. We tried to call Cowboy back several times to discuss this with him, but he would NEVER return our calls. This is when I decided to call him from a different phone and told the receptionist a different name while pretending to want to talk to Cowboy about buying a car. He answered the call, of course, then I preceded to tell him who I really was. I explained everything to him again, and he knew exactly who I was. He called me by my entire name. He promised to call back after he spoke to his manager, but that never happened. Its been over 2 months since then, and nothing. We have contacted the head of Toyota and they have been very apologetic about how we were treated at this particular dealership. They have had many complaints from Toyota of Alvin. I never write complaints, but I feel very strongly about the shadiness we have experienced with Toyota of Alvin and I want to make sure that others know not to fall for it. We have since bought Toyota's from Maik Haik Toyota in League City and Auto Nation Toyota and they were both AMAZING!!!  ",1.0
22,"May 19, 2019","Be very cautious about their fees, especially with used cars. I recently bought a preowned car from this dealership where I negotiated a deal which I felt was a great deal, although assuming the +TTL would assume a couple of hundred for dealer fee's and and of course the sales tax of the car however when it came to signing the documentation with finance I noticed the fee of $1785 for paint and protection which I wasn't told about previously therefore I inquired about the fee and was told it was no longer a paint and protection fee but rather a reconditioning fee for work that was done to the car as a part of their servicing of a used car, mind you the car I was buying was a 2018 car with 17,000 miles one would assume what kind of work would you need?? After my inquiry the sales manager came over and told me how disappointed he was since he would have thought I would be happy with the deal however my point was clear, what is this fee and why should I pay it, and after somewhat of a patronizing conversation from the sales manager he left and I thought to myself this wasn't right and time to leave. After advising the finance person that I have no confidence I decided to leave although  the sales person asked if he could help, I mentioned the fee and how unhappy I was, he mentioned he would get it reduced which he did although my $500 which by at this time my energy was somewhat lacking, I thought regardless of the fee the car was great (emotions) kicked in and I proceeded to purchase the car.  My advice is, please make sure you're only being charged the TTL (Tax Title and License fees) for which you've agreed and don't trust their sales manager on this aspect. I love the car although that element with this dealership needs some serious work. Kudos to the Sales Rep who intervened to help.",2.2
23,"May 09, 2019","The price on the Apex GPS system changed 3 times before we finally signed all the papers.  The F&I person is a lying piece of garbage and general sales manager isn't any better.  I'm still waiting for them to cancel the Apex and get the money refunded, 2 weeks after requesting it.  I wish there were a state agency I could go to over the crappy way they treat people.  So far I've been able to cancel the Gap insurance and maintenance agreement, which only took about 2 dozen phone calls to dead end numbers and hours on hold, and then found tire and wheel coverage is on the contract, which I knew nothing about and would not have purchased.  I still don't see it on the contract, so they hid it somewhere.  To call them liars and thieves is giving them a big compliment.",1.0
24,"April 25, 2019","This place is a Toyota dealership so you wouldn’t think they used sleazy and unethical sales tactics...THEY DO! Toyota should seriously remove their name from such trash.

Gave us the whole spiel and even test drive it with us THEN told us the price was $2,000 more than the advertised price plus t, t & l?! VERY SKETCHY! Do not trust them at all. Very unprofessional.

25,"March 13, 2019","I recently purchased two vehicles from this dealership, one for me and one for my husband.  We were both really excited.  We had a really long wait in the dealership (longer than normal).  Our sales person was great to us, and Bruno even bought us snacks while we waited for fiance.  That part went okay too.  Where they lose me and my family from ever shopping with them again, is post-sale.  There were issues that came up with my trade-in and I tried on multiple occasions to get someone in finance to call me back.  NO ONE EVER DID.  The front desk person was telling me always that they're too busy and she assured she'd have someone call. Never.  I was dilegent in calling them and was to the point of taking a vacation day from my job so I could go in person to get someone to answer me. My sales person called about a different matter, so I asked him to help me with an update on the status of this trade-in issue, it's a big deal and will affect my credit. He lied. He said they took care of it. 2 weeks later my husband picks up our plates (6 weeks with the new cars) and they're just now dealing with the issue.

We sat up a time for Saturday for me to drive back over and when I arrived the manager tells me again that the person who writes the checks is not there.  I am highly upset at this point.  I asked him to get somebody to write me a check,  he stated he couldn't get anyone today and I would need to come back on Monday,  I asked to speak with his boss he left and sent a salesman over with some paperwork and asked me to leave, which I gladly did.

This was not disclosed at the time of the purchase and quite frankly had I of known at this time I would have requested that anything aftermarket be returned to factory spec so the extended warranty would be honored for malfunctions. 
You would think that reputable dealer would not hesitate to spend a measly $300 to make this issue right to retain business and grow the business through referrals. Unfortunately Toyota of Alvin is not one of those dealers. I will be picking up my vehicle and taking it to Ron Carter to do the repairs. Toyota of Alvin will not see another dime from me.

I clearly explained in English that I want a 2017 or 2018 Tundra with leather. It was raining and this guy didn't want to get wet! He found a car and we jumped in. We flew around the parking lot. He would jump out look at a truck jump back in and fly around a little more. We ended up right back where we started looking at a vehicle with a LIFT for $72,000, MSRP was 52,000. This so called sales man walked away from me for a total of four times! I wouldn't buy a vehicle from TOYOTA OF ALVIN if it was the last dealership on the face of the planet.

So my mother and I get over there to test drive a car they said was available and Frank Oloh informed us that they didn't have it anymore because it got flooded. So he tried to get me to buy another 4Runner which didn't have a sunroof. I told him I had to have a sunroof so he said they could add one. Um, no thanks. Then he proceeded to attempt to sell me a 2014 for $10k more which I repeatedly told him I wasn't willing to pay that much. My mom told him to come down on price and all he had to say was it was already reduced. Then as we were leaving we took a look at the 2014 and the leather on the drivers seat had creases in it and the console was horribly scratched up. Definitely not worth $34k. Frank is the definition of a sleazy salesman and I wouldn't set foot back in this crap shack if it was the last dealership left in Texas. I have difficulty even giving it 1 star.

47,"July 07, 2017","O.K.  Overall, kinda the run of the mill dealership experience.  Except for the F&I guy. 
 Chris Tinsley.  Really cool dude.  Found a truck online, drove 3 hours from Austin, started great, went south, then ended fabulous.

First, the cons:

Dealt with Frank Oloh.  Nice guy.  Hard to understand.  He did tell me a FLAT OUT LIE.  Basically, I was underwater on my Camaro.  Toyota of Alvin would NOT beat Carmax's offer to buy my Camaro.  They basically said, ""Take it to Carmax.""  Which I did.  Strike 1.  I said, ""I'm under water on that Camaro; will my finance company take a credit card to make up the difference?""
""Of course,"" said Frank.  Money is money.  Your finance company will take any payment they can get.""
So, I bring my car to Carmax.  Remember, I'm underwater.  They take the appraisal that was done.  SUre, we'll buy your car, they said.  But you have to make up the difference with a debit card. 
What?????  I just bought a car contingent on my using credit to make up the difference.  Anyway, no finance company, anywhere will allow you to make up the difference between what you owe and what the car's worth with a credit card.  No one.  I was lied to.  And bought a truck based on that lie.
Strike 2.  

I got a really crap terms.  Strike 3.  But I really wanted the truck, drove three hours to get it, and agreed to the terms.  I get it.  I am an adult.  Shame on me.  

Pros:

Then, as I'm waiting to sign the paperwork with the F&I guy, he walks up, out of nowhere, and says, I really got you a fantastic deal.  Lowered your interest rate, lowered your payments, and now you can afford gap and a 2 year warranty.  The F&I guy basically fixed everything.  So, in a nutshell, yes, get a car from this dealer, watch what they say, make phone calls to friends and do your research regarding what you are promised, and get the right F&I person.  Common sense.  But stop negotiation to check on claims made by salesmen.  Use your phone, call a bank, whatever you have to do.

Timing wasn't good, but they called everyday 2times a day for a week. So we found time in our schedule (i.e. took the day off work) to make the 1.5 hour drive (one way) over there.   We talked to the manger and sales person 3 times to confirm the vehicle was there, even 1 hour before we got there. They assured us it was. Got to the dealership and of course the sales lady we dealt with was busy in a ""meeting"".  Then they took down information as to what criteria we were looking for in a vehicle.  The new sales person came back to tell us the vehicle we were looking at was sold, but they had other vehicles for us to look at.  No Thank You!  No apologies or concern for the trouble they caused.

50,"November 06, 2016","This is by far the worst car buying ever.  This place did not honor promises and is a disaster at customer service.  Do yourself a favor and avoid this place, but if you insist on buying a car there, be aware of the so-called Apex GPS and do not take for granted what they tell you. Ask for the Apex price (it is not free) and get it in writing.  Also, check the math before you sign any paper.  They put in front of me a contract that had $1,100 more than the correct amount. Thankfully, I asked for the backup numbers and caught their “mistake”. 
  
The car was a demo with almost 10,000 miles due for oil change. (Yes, they were selling a new car due up for service.) Mr. Oloh, the salesman, told me to come back the next day for service at any time, no appointment needed.  Mr. Oloh said it would take 45 minutes, but I drove out of the dealer 3+ hours later.  As an excuse, service said the car had to be detailed, but I still had to spend time myself cleaning goo out the windows when I got home.  I don't have a problem if it takes 3 hours, but they should have told me that rather than keep telling me the car ""will be here shortly"".  May be telling me I needed an appointment would have been the correct thing to do. 

Later, staff became non-responsive to my calls and emails when trying to resolve the issue with ApexGPS. I had more bad experiences, in particular with the finance manager and the lack of respect with my time, that I am not writing here for the sake of brevity.

Last, I never got the Toyota survey about my experience with this place. Dealer is to send the customers' contact information, and they knew I was upset.  I let the readers draw their conclusions why I didn’t get the survey.

She appears to be functioning in the capacity of a Carnival Barker to get you into the dealership for ""processing"".  She has no authority and her word is none binding and worthless on anything she says.    Kind of a long story, so briefly, I was baited with the option of two 2015 Siennas, (new, left over from last year) she said priced in the mid 30's.  I asked, do you mean $35K or less?  If so, I'm interested.   She said yes, come on in, but she called and answered my email question on price over the phone (no tracks).  I went in. The price was $37,500.  I left.  Later wrote and offered them a $37500 firm drive out price but, for one particular vehicle of two they had shown me.  I wrote that the offer was for the white one, NOT the silver one.  She wrote back that her manager would GLADLY accept that offer, come on in.  I went in, they showed me the silver one.  I refused saying I wanted the white one.  They brought it up from the back.  I told Frank Oloh ""let's go over the numbers again before I send my wife home,"" so there will be no mistakes or confusion.  He said they were correct, and I could send my My wife home.  He gave me a key to the vehicle.  We sat down and he started paper work.  When finished he got up and went to back.  A guy with an ""ear bob"" came out, (so unprofessional) and  Frank disappeared.   Mr. ""ear bob"" told me they could not sell the vehicle for $37500 drive out.  He said  I was ""not even close on my offer to what that had to have.""  I asked why then did Melissa  say  in writing that her manager would gladly accept that offer.  He apologized and disappeared, leaving me sitting at a table by myself in the show room, ""just twiddling my thumbs"" and stranded without a vehicle to leave in.   Frank came back to his desk in a little while.  I gave him the key back and he would not even look at me...said nothing then disappeared leaving me there.  I called my wife to come back to pick me up, meanwhile, I just stood around outside, embarrassed and humiliated waiting until she came to get me.  I purchased my Sienna at a reputable dealership a few days later in a clean no hassle deal.   Contacted Toyota Corp. with report....nice,concerned,  but said they could really not do anything.  If I were ""Mr. Toyota"", whoever that is, I would have some leverage on a dealership who  humiliated my potential customer in that manner.

It was only a minor annoyance until it bit me badly one day when it locked me out of my truck with the engine running. I went into the dealership and talked to the service manager (Jimmy) for about 20 minutes describing the incident. Although he promised to investigate, he never did.
I wrote to Toyota describing the problem and they replied they had notified the dealership and that Kelli Pope would be contacting me. She did, and I went through the whole problem with her. She said she would investigate but I never heard from Kelli again. The problem kept happening but I had taken steps to insure I was never locked out of my vehicle with the engine running again.
So now it is 2016 and my lease is about to expire so I decide to buy the Tundra. No big deal, the dealership arranges financing and I now own my 2013 Tundra. A month later I discover that my credit score dropped 27 points because Toyota of Alvin caused 3 hard inquiries into my credit report in ONE day. I asked the dealership why, with my excellent credit score of 741, it took 3 hard inquiries to finance my Tundra. Over a week later Toyota of Alvin still has not responded to my question.
Totally unresponsive dealership, and it is easy to see why it has a C- rating with the BBB.

After spending hours shopping online, Toyota of Alvin had the vehicle we were looking for.. not once, but twice.  We are an hour away, but definitely worth the drive.  Austin greeted us upon arrival and had the car pulled up and ready for a test drive.   He was very knowledgeable about every aspect of the car.  Frank helped us get the best price for both the new car as well as our trade in value on our truck.  After making the deal, Toni delivered goodies for purchasing and discussed service and everything that was available to us through the dealership.  Wesley in financing made the final phase of the purchase as painless as possible.  Even though it was closing time, he was very thorough.

88,"August 14, 2015","I wish this place had a negative star...I am in the market to purchase a van for my special needs child.  I was in communication with John since July and regarding a specific sienna.  After he gave me a price, I finally decided to go and check out the car.  I live over an hour and  drive each way.  At 5:30pm in the evening I decided to go and pick up my FAMILY! and drive to Alvin to look at the car and purchase it.  When we got there John and Leah greeted me and said that they will set me up with a Sales person.  I was taken back a little because I thought I had already communicated with John this whole time and now I have to deal with another sales man.  So I was engaged with a sales man met up with him and said he will go and get the car.  It took him 20 minutes to finally bring the car in.  When he brought it, the car seemed to be driven because it had  347 miles and it was very dirty inside.  He tells us to take a spin and when I asked him if he will come with us to show us the details of the car, he said no you go ahead and test drive it. 

I test drove the car and immediately I felt that the car is not right.  I drove the car back to the dealership and he said ok lets go and do the paperwork. The salesman didn't even 
take us to his desk to figure out the price instead he immediately started to fill in the credit application and I asked, that I don't want to fill in the credit information until we agree on the price that we had talked about and that is where it all started.  

He started explaining to me about the process and that I don't tell him how to do his job and that he has been here since 9 in morning and that he wants to make sure that I dont wast his time.  I was shocked to hear this words from him.  Wasting his time, I just drove over an hour  with my family and he thinks I am here to waste his time.  So then he stops the application process and wants a signature from me saying that if the price is right I will buy the car from him, I completely refused to do that how can i sign on a blank page!  he explained to me about the ""process"" again and finally I told him that I don't want to deal with him anymore as I don't feel comfortable at all. 

After a few minutes the ""manager"" by the name Kevin comes to us and shows us the paper with the price of the car.  I told him that we have already negotiated the price and showed him the email trail and the price. He said no and that I am mistaken and said that is not possible.  I showed him the email and made him read the entire email trail word by word and asked him at what point was I mistaken and he said that it is a mistake and walks off and tells us to leave the dealership.  I was very shocked by this type of behavior from a manager.  I asked him specific questions about the details of the car and he said he doesn't know anything about those.  

I spent over an hour driving, paid tolls, made special arrangement for my special needs child and now the guy tells me to leave the dealership! This is not right...I would definitely not recommend this dealership to anybody, from reading other reviews it looks they do a bait and switch, where they tell you a price and make you come in and then sucker you into buying another car.  

Oh by the way, I have not heard anything back from Leah or John or an apologies from anybody about this.

I came back to get the Prius 4 and they gave me the True Car deal for the 3 on the 4.,5.0
113,"August 15, 2014","I TRUSTED  the Toyota name. I remember the new smell of my dads first brand new car. It was a Toyota. So when my friend kept calling me saying he was working there &  could get me a really good deal on a car, and take my trade in I was all for it.  I ended up not getting a Toyota but  financed a 2007 Dodge Nitro from here June 14, 2014. Pretty much the worst decision I've ever made. I walked out of this place three times during the ""negotiation"" process.   I should have trusted my gut and never let them hassle me into getting a car.   there is ONLY  one thing they are good at and that's it is "" Sales"" They could probably sell raid to a roach. 

However, Since I've had  the car, it has been nothing but a huge 5-year long headache. The car has been to service 3 different times since June 14th. Today is Aug. 15th. Majority of the time they've had it. I may have driven it a total of 1.5 weeks. The first time they had it (9) days. The next time (15)  days and they picked it up THE EVERY SAME DAY IT WAS DROPPED BACK OFF TO ME ATFER HAVING IT TWO WHOLE WEEKS,  now they've had it ( 10) days and counting. So basically they've had it almost a full month.  I was told by (3) different employees that my car was never even inspected by service when it was traded in!!  The car is not even safe to be on the road with!!! Each time I get my car back it runs worse then before. The last time my car was returned to me, it could not believe that a Toyota employee drove 14.3 miles in that car and actually  dropped it off to me, The wheel was heavy, the gas petal is hard to push! Something is not right. If I was the employee I would have turned around and took the car back to service. They have given me loaner cars and I appreciate that, even though they had me in a mini-van that was messing up my dating life. But that's a whole other story. My problem with Toyota of Alvin is this, buying a car is a really big deal, I am now stuck in a 5 year loan and stuck with a lemon. They aren't even able to tell me what's wrong with my car. When I call them, no one is able to tell me anything. All they tell me is, they will have someone else call me. They never ever call back. My second car payment is due today and I haven't even had the darn car. do you know how unsettling that is?? But since they already have their money from the bank, they don't care about me, or my car. They just needed to get the car sold. I'm not sure why these sites make you leave stars, TOYOTA OF ALVIN DESERVES ZERO STARS! Ive left several messages for KELLY POPE she never calls back, I did talk to her once in person when she brought me out some Starbucks coffee, how sweet right? Well it was just water in a Starbucks cup. She told me she would get things taken care of but that was 7/17/14 and she hasn't called me since. She  just has my sales associate call me.  I already have his number, address, and wife's number, why do you continue to have him call me, if IM LEAVING MESSAGES FOR YOU!!!! how does that make any sense?? She's a customer service manager? No one has called me after they picked it back up after they told me everything was fixed. I REPEAT, DO NOT BUY A CAR FROM HERE!! ",1.0

As part of the special price, we had to agree to finance through them.  We had been told that ahead of time, and had agreed to it.  The rate was not bad- 1.9%.  Everything still going good.

After being there for over 3 hours (busy, short a finance officer, understandable) we were ready to sign the paperwork.  On the closing statement there were two additional charges- $495 each for paint protection and theft protection.  When we stated that we did not wish to purchase either, we were informed it was already included on the truck, and could not be removed. No prior mention of these charges, not included on sticker... Only mention we saw on these items was on an upside sheet where you have the option of adding gap protection, extended warranty, etc.....Apparently these items ARE NOT an option- you have to take one of the packages. 

So- over 3 hours wasted.  If they had been upfront when we first arrived on the cost of the vehicle, we probably would not have purchased it, but also would not be upset with their business practices.  ",1.4

I am a big advocate of word of mouth advertising and I'll tell you that Ron Carter has earned that from me.  Shop Alvin.  Shop Ron Carter!!!",4.8

Miriam, in the custom department, worked so hard and was absolutely on top of my add ons and made sure the quality was impeccable. I got exactly the interior I wanted.

145,"August 21, 2012"," I went in to take a look at the used vehicles on the lot. Found the one for me. Traded in my truck in my father's name. After signing the paperwork my finance guy told me I could sign with my Credit Union and void the finance agreement with Ron Carter. Now that two weeks have past with Ron Carter not completing the the financing with my CU I have to be the ""middle Man"" between the two. Which by all means is HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. 

 Not to mention that the truck that is in my father's name is not only waiting to be  paid off by Ron Carter but is being being sold right now. How can you sell a truck that is not even paid off. Now I have been trying to call Ron Carter since last Thursday with only getting voice mail boxes from all sorts of employees. With not one single call back. 

 I will NEVER do business with Ron Carter Toyota again after this horrible experience. I have bought a Cobalt from the Chevy side and a Lancer from the used lot off of HWY 6. Those were the best experiences I had with Ron Carter. Sorry Ron Carter Toyota you guys need to get your priorities straight. ",2.6

147,"July 06, 2012","Bought a used vehicle from Ron Carter Toyota. Agreed on a drive out price and signed the paperwork. No one mentioned that one of the fees was over $380 for Vehicle Anti-Theft Insurance. When we noticed we were charged for insurance that we did not want and that was not disclosed to us we called the dealership and were told the owner requires that it be purchased with any vehicle. So if you don't allow them to profit from an insurance policy sale there is no deal. It's take it or leave it. Bad Business forcing the customer to buy a product to do business with the dealership. Even worse not mentioning that you have to buy an insurance product during the deal. 

After having to talk at length with more than one manager and refusing to be placated by inexpensive Dealer services like detailing and filling up my vehicle with gas I finally found out that the General Manager is the person with the authority to resolve the issue. Kim Eddy made the right decision to reimburse my money for the insurance policy. There is no telling how many people don't realize this has happened to them. The dealership needs to change how it does business.  ",2.3

He asked Shannon to check the availability and make sure it was still on the lot, before we drove the distance. Shannon called back right away, and when we arrived, he was very courteous and not the least bit pushy, which was so refreshing compared to how we were treated at other Toyota/Scion dealerships. 
Although we did not purchase this specific car, we ended up buying a 2012 RAV 4, and again, Shannon and the general manager located the one we wanted and went ""that extra mile"" for us, which is indeed a rarity in this day and time. We are very happy with our decision, and later today, [7/05/12 @ 1:00] we will have our first experience with the service department. Then I will be happy to rate the first 2 categories of this survey. 
I cannot close without kudos to David Le as well. He was just terrific also, and was very thorough when we were signing all the papers to finalize purchase. He also fine tuned our warranty package to suit our needs, and gave us the lug nuts free of charge.
I will definitely recommend Ron Carter Toyota, Shannon George, and David Le. Thanks for the opportunity to express our opinion.

We shopped around for quite a while and with many different dealers.  We queried Ron Carter via their internet sales department and soon received a call from John Hitzel.  After serious negotiations with several dealers over several days we simply could not believe the deal that John and James gave us OVER THE PHONE!  Expecting that the numbers would ""mysteriously"" change once we actually went into the dealership, we decided to visit Ron Carter.  John and James were true to their words.  Not one number was different than promised.  After agreeing on the sale price we visited David Le in financing (expecting the ""hard sell"" that up to that point we didn't have to endure)!!!  David was straight forward, honest, efficient and a pleasure to deal with.

My husband went in on 5/19 for a routine maintenance  on his Tundra and while he was waiting he saw a Chevy Tahoe in your used parking lot. He fell in love with it. He knew this would be perfect with our recent life change. With mother and grandmother moving in and I needed a bigger vehicle. I was going to try and wait at least a year but with our family increasing by two more people I needed the room. Robert, Sammy and David made this happen. I was able to trade in my 4Runner and get a Chevy Tahoe off your used car lot. My payment only went up $50.00. These guys are awesome. They treat us with the upmost respect every time we come in, even when my two year old is running round like a wild Comanche. I could not have asked for a better experience.

183,"January 29, 2012","I took my 2007 Toyota Camry LE to Ron Carter Toyota in Alvin TX for an oil change and tire rotation on Dec. 23, 2011. After leaving the dealership, we drove to Lousianna for the evening. While on our trip there on I-10, we lost the oil pan drain plug near Orange, TX. because it was not wrench tightened. We heard a loud pop on the bottom of the car and not knowing it was our oil pan plug hitting the bottom of the car we continued to travel approx. 10 to 15 mins. at 70 mph. We crossed the state line and we noticed the oil light come on at the 7 mile exit in Louisianna. The engine began to knock loudly. I called the dealership and talked to Roger Hebert and their GM to explain what had happened and told them that they needed to arrange for a wrecker to come and get the car and take it to Ron Carter and to arrange a rental car for us to drive home.  I met with their GM, Service MGR and their ""Loss Prevention Rep"" the next morning to discuss the damages and they said that they would completely rebuild the engine to my satisfaction. Now, after all this, Ron Carter presented me with the paperwork reflecting what repairs they had made to the engine where it reflected that they did not replace the internal rod bearings or main bearings. Essentially all that was rebuilt was the cylinder head.Ron Carter continually refuses to rebuild the engine to meet my satisfaction. Now all they want to do is purchase my vehicle, or for me to accept the vehicle ""as is"" with a certified warranty with an additional 55,000 miles. (This vehicle has been serviced regularly at 5,000 mile intervals at Ron Carter since new and I have never had any problems with this vehicle until this time when Ron Carter admitted responsibility for not installing the drain plug after the oil change.) I have consulted several Toyota Delearships and independent mechanics and they all recommended either replacing the engine or totally rebuilding the engine replacing all the internal parts due to the high friction of not having oil.

He made me NO promises but said he would get with finance dept and see what could be done.  I filled out online app, submitted it and within an hour he called me back with a positive feeling.  I drove from La Porte to Alvin to look at this car- we test drove it - got all my paperwork done and I was out of there within 2 hours.  Very reasonable!  Next day John Paul was out, but Sammy Yanes took over and by the end 7 pm that evening I drove the car home.  If Sammy said he would call me back within 5 mins, he called me back within 5 mins.

I drove the car back to Ron Carter from the dealership across town with the salesman. I loved the car, the price was right and it was exactly what I wanted. I came into the dealership with a preapproved car loan. after 2 DAYS and 3 trips, Ashley, the chain smoking, frantic, disorganized loan officer, rejected my preapproval, reran my credit without my permission, had me put 500.00 down, walked away from the final signing and dumped the whole thing into the lap of Bobby, the harsh, rude, abrasive loan manager to sign the final paperwork. When It was time to FINALLY drive away with my perfect new car, I was told it was washed and filled with gas, which it was not!

My son went in to purchase a used truck, well they automatically raised the price by three thousand dollars over what was on the internet for the vehicle. The dealership took all of his information and checked for a credit history. This is where I came into the picture. The dealership told my son that he did not quailfy to finance the truck and to see if he could get a co-signer. My son called me and asked if I would co-sign for his loan. I went to the dealership and gave them my information and they approved the sale. The dealership told my son to take the truck and that they would let him know who the financer was on Monday. Well on Monday the dealer calls and requests income and residency verification for my son and I. Seems that the dealership put the horse before the cart and the banks turned my son down because he has no credit. My son had traded in a Kia that had just been paid off and had also filled the truck up with $81.00 worth of fuel. When we went to turn the truck in we asked about the fuel and were told that they did not charge my son for driving the truck for a day so they would not reimburse my son for the fuel. We took the Kia and asked for something to prove that my son had turned the truck in to the dealership. The sales-person returned with a hand written note that stated that this truck was returned. The note did not say what truck or to who it was returned or by whom it was returned. Very unprofessional if you ask me. As we drove off in the Kia, my daughter noticed that the dealer had removed the inspection sticker from the windshield. When we got home, my daughter called the dealership and asked about the inspection sticker and was told that she would have to take the car and have it reinspected then bring proof that the car had been inspected to the dealership and they would send her a check to cover the cost of the inspection.

195,"July 11, 2011","Historically, purchasing a vehicle is a stressful, time consuming process.  Art Moreno changed my attitude about that.  Art took the time to answer every question I had regarding my new Tundra, showed me his entire inventory, looked up the inventory at other dealers for me, and stayed till 11:00 p.m. to help me work through the options.  He made the process interesting and painless, and was extremely friendly and attentive, rather than the typical, pushy type of salesman I've experienced in the past.  You can rest assured I will recommend him to all of my family and friends, and he should be considered the standard by which all car sales people are measured.

Bobby (Finance) and Bill (Service) were also very friendly and helpful at every step of the process.

It was a pleasure purchasing my vehicle from your organization!

I was treated  more as a friend than just someone purchasing a used truck.

I most highly reccommend Mr. Moreno to Anyone in the market of purchasing a new or used Toyota.
You can rest assured, the next Toyota I purchase, will be from M. Moreno.
In my opinion, Mr. Moreno should be the mark that all other car sales professionals strive to set their standards of customer satisfaction.

They are 60 miles away from where I live so I was very clear on price and terms with Shirley, the sales women that I was dealing with was very polite on the phone and understood that I would be purchasing a vehicle this week. She knew that I had a long drive and needed the terms of the deal set before I would make that drive with my wife, 3yr old son, and 12mo baby. The deal was on a 2010 Toyota Corolla Stock #: PT2315 for $12500 which I had negotiated with Shirley down from their advertised price of $13,995. Of course after I haul my family 60 miles to get the car Shirley is a no show and they will not budge from $13,995. I had Shirley's cell number so I called and she basically said tough luck. Zach the Salesman that I was dealing with confirmed when I first arrived that the $12500 deal was still valid. But of course when it came time to look at the paperwork they were no where near that. After wasting about an hour of my time pretending that he ""negotiating"" a price with the sales manager he came back with the same offer. The sales manager then came out to tell me there was nothing that I could do. I had Shirley on the phone at the time I was talking to him, but he would not talk to her.

Not because we couldn't afford one or our credit was bad.. but because we never have wanted to take the hit of the loss of value when that new car rolls off the lot.. So we were really not in the market to buy a brand new car on our visit to Ron Carter on 1-12-2011...  So what happen is; We received a flyer in the mail saying Ron Carter was interested in buying my wifes 2005 Toyota Rav4 (which we purchased ""pre-owned"" from Ron Carter) and they were offering 0% financing or $1500/ plus $500 off from the flyer.. So we decided to go see if they really meant business.. We figured it was just a ploy to get us up to the sales center.. But after some very informative conversing with our sales associate (Zeke), we felt like they did mean business and wanted to sell us the vehicle my wife was interested in.. Zeke was very informative, very professional and made sure he put us in the car my wife wanted at the price we wanted to pay..

Two days after buying the vehicle Zeke called us to check up on us and asked if we were still happy with our purchase.. I did advise him of a slight noise the Camry was making up towards the right front wheel area of the car when the brakes are applied.. He said he would make sure the service department would be ready to take a look at this when I go Saturday Jan.15th to have the Xzilion added to the car.. I guess we will see how well the service department does on this issue..
 
But our overall experience with Zeke and Sales staff was A+ .. I will definitely recommend Ron Carter to anyone in the market for a new or used vehicle...   ",5.0

The dealership itself was very clean and well kept. The rest of the sales staff was very friendly. After we decided on the corolla Sammy introduced us to the parts associates and service advisors. overall we had an enjoyable buying experience and I will recomend Sammy and Ron carter to my friends.,5.0
258,"January 11, 2011",We had a Tundra and an Avalon that we wanted to trade in on a Sequoia. Wesley went out of his way to help us.  We were at the dealership in our car.  He went to Pearland with us to bring back our Tundra.  My husband had a lot of tools in the truck and was unable at the time to lift anything.  Wesley went home with us and unloaded the tools out of the Tundra and then drove the Tundra back to Ron Carter in Alvin.  I would recommend the Ron Carter Dealership all the time and I would Recommend Wesley to anyone I recommend Ron Carter to.  He is an asset to Ron Carter.,5.0
259,"January 08, 2011","We needed a reliable vehicle fast and no hassles... and that's what we got!  My wife stopped in to view a Camry (advertised at $199/month lease).  With the help of Britanny she found what she needed and was allowed to take it home and let me drive it (I was at home with kids). We drove back with our trade-in and signed the papers without any hassles and it was ours that evening.  If I would have been with my wife originally, this transaction might have taken less than 60 minutes!  Great deal... Great service... as advertised!  ",5.0
260,"January 04, 2011","When I go there, I was actually going to just test frive a new used 2010 Jeep Commander.  I was there for a toyota but have always liked the Jeep and saw it. 
Wesley, the guy who made everything happen, then walked up and I told him why I was there.  just to test drive.  I wasn't going to buy.  At all.  Did not think I could get out from under my other car.  A Ford Fusion, 2006, with 125 thousand miles on it. I owed 7,102.  Kelly Blue Book said like 4,200. Wesley asked me if I could drive out of here would I.  Of coarse I said yes but did not think it was going to happen.  In the end, they paid it off and made it happen.  It was awesome.  Wesley did everything he could and came through as well as the manager.",5.0
261,"December 31, 2010","The sales associate made purchasing the car of my choice a very pleasant and satisfying experience.  There was no pressure, and I felt that I was in control of the process at all times.  I was prepared with a price that I wanted to pay and it was accepted without having to negotiate.  At no point did I consider going to any other dealer.",4.8
262,"December 30, 2010","Salesman was great and Dennis handled the financing package well, as he always does.  Easy to deal with, black/white terms, price is what we expected, appreciated the additional off due to mileage already on car.  

Car was delivered as expected, will need help with bluetooth link for iPhone.  Can't figure that out.  ",5.0
263,"December 29, 2010","Overall our experience was very good. John Paul's customer service and personality were exceptional. He and Todd Taylor did a good job at getting our questions answered and making sure the vehicle was ready to go. John Paul was new but it seemed as if he and been there for a while. He was relaxed and seemed to respond well with Todd Taylor. Todd's experience in sales was obvious by the way he conducted himself. My wife liked the way John Paul did not make her feel pressured and gave her time to make her decision. Todd Taylor listened to what our  families needs were and actually changed our minds in what we thought we wanted to buy. His experience led us to the perfect vehicle for us, the Sienna, which I very much so appreciated. So a big thanks to JP and Todd for assisting us with our purchase. The sales manager who decided final price and trade should be fired and could use customer service lessons from JP and Todd. The customer service manager who helped resolve a minor issue at the end was very polite, professional and went out of his way to make sure we were satisfied (I apologize I can't remember his name). In the future I hope to do all my vehicle business with John Paul. He sold me on Toyota and I will insist he is my salesperson for any future business.",4.2
264,"December 29, 2010",Another great experience at Ron Carter - Willing to understand our needs in purchasing a new vehicle after 11 1/2 years - John Paul was very courteous and attentive to our needs.  We will recommend Ron Carter and John Paul to friends and family in the future.,5.0
265,"December 28, 2010","
This is our second time to purchase a vehicle at Ron Carter. Once again we felt like we got a good deal on a quality vehicle.  John Paul was very helpful in helping us make the a decision about which car to buy.  He listened and made suggestions that fit our needs in a car. In the end we chose a Corolla and I think we made the right choice.  We took a lot of time test driving different cars and asking John Paul questions and he was helpful the entire time.  Although John Paul spent a lot of time with us, he never gave us the feeling that we ""owed him a sale"" - I have felt this way at other dealers.  Thanks for your time and low pressure, it definitely makes the difference in return business and referrals.  We got a great deal on the car as well; we definitely feel satisfied with our experience at Ron Carter, and would recommend John Paul to our friends.",4.8
266,"December 13, 2010",GREAT SALESMAN! GREAT PRICE! We will definately return and refer customers. They have a very friendly staff. fast service. We bought a Tundra for a very good price. The finance guy was also very friendly and helpful. We plan on taking the vehicle back for service at this location.,5.0
267,"December 03, 2010","My experience with Ron Carter Toyota was by far the best car buying experience I have ever had.  John Paul had the car I was looking for ready to test drive before I arrived to our morning appointment. He explained in detail all the options and safety features Toyota had to offer on new models convincing me I had come to the right place. John Paul was very knowledgable of his inventory and since the price was so unbeatable I was actually able to get the sport edition I never thought I could afford! I am so happy with my new Toyota and will refer all my family friends and co workers to Ron Carter Toyota and John Paul. The entire sales staff, including mangers Dennis and Harry were friendly and so happy to congratulate me on my first car purchase ever! I also would like to say that the ladies Joni and Kim in the finance department made the paperwork the easiest part of the day. Everything was explained very well and in only a matter of minutes I was comfortable and confident I was getting the best deal with top of the line customer service. I will definitely be coming back to Ron Carter Toyota for all my future purchases. ",5.0
268,"November 19, 2010","I was driving through the parking lot looking at Toyota Tundra when Zeke drove up to me on a golf cart with a great big smile, asking how can I help you. I informed him I was looking for a white Toyota Tundra CrewMax 5.7L with 381hp.  He was really nice and knowledgeable of both trucks that we test drove.  That made me feel very comfortable, with this being my very first time purchasing a new vehicle.  My overall experience with Zeke and Ron Carter was excellent; I got the truck I wanted at the price I wanted to pay.  I will most definitely come back to Ron Carter Toyota to purchase another vehicle, and i will refer other friends, family members and co-worker to Ron Carter.",4.8
269,"November 18, 2010","From the start, this Salesman was a professional.  I visited the dealership twice, and on both occasions, John Paul and management understood what I was expecting from them. John Paul listened intently to my expectations, understanding immediately which questions to ask to zero in on my needs.  John Paul proposed offerings that were within my price range and remained with me every step of the way through the process.  I spoke to management twice during my visits, and each time I walked away satisfied.  Every time I have purchased a new vehicle, I had buyer's remorse within 2 weeks; I do not have that with this purchase or dealership.  John Paul and the management team at Ron Carter are top-notch professionals who have earned my business and accolades, and will be the only dealership I will refer my friends to.",5.0
270,"November 17, 2010",My buying experience with Zeke was great and I would recommend him to my friends and family.  He didn't use pressure tactics and tried to get me in the vehicle I wanted.  I haven't bought a car in a while so it was a great experience at great dealership.,5.0
271,"November 16, 2010","not the lowest price but not the highest price either, middle of the road. dealership needs to recognize and address time value of customers. vehicle was not ready at time of pickup and some levels of communication need improvement, more coaching rather than complete systematic overhaul. not all customers need coddling, some like to get down to business and either yes or no, then move on. anxious to see followup after the sale, so far great, but time tells the story.

Asim kept us up-to-date on the status of our vehicle order, and went out of his way to get us a good deal on our trade-in.  We would definitely use him again on another vehicle purchase.",4.8
