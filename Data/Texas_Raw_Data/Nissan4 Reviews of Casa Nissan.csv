I will think twice next time I come in. I might even bring a snail to the waiting area and see how long it takes to cross to montana and MAYBE my car will be ready",1.0
1,"April 30, 2015",I've been trying to trade in my Volkswagen Jetta for something better. I went to a few dealership but everyone wanted to offer me peanuts on my trade in. I did an on-line inquiry and minutes later Juan Chavez contacted me by phone. I explained to him the situation and he assured me that he was going to do everything in his power to help me out. It turns out that Casa Nissan gave me an excellent deal on my trade in and got me driving in a brand new 2015 Nissan Sentra. The best part is they lowered my payment and I have no payment due for 90 days!!!!,5.0
2,"February 05, 2015","GARBAGE. I got ripped off for a murano, the contract said battery would be replaced, next day i tow the car in to hear that they ""FORGOT"" to replace it. Stops again a few days later, i tow it to my mechanic instead, said the battery was old. Bunch of liars. The week after i find the fuel sensor was deficient, couldve gotten into a serious accident when it ran out on the highway. Im setting up a case to take them to court.",1.0
