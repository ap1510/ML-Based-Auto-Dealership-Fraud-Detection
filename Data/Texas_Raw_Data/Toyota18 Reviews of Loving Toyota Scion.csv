1,"May 05, 2018","Repair work  at this dealership is good, but be very vigilant with the service advisors; make sure to get everything in writing and ask lots of questions; don't assume they will do everything you ask, make sure to get an update before they drive your vehicle out of the service department; they get very defensive when you question them; also double check your bill, question everything ",3.2
2,"January 04, 2018",Excellent service and knowledge. The dealership reached out to other in state dealerships to find what I was looking for. I am grateful for their collaboration.,5.0
3,"November 11, 2016",Worst service ever. They took around 2 hours to get my car ready. I learned from last time to get there early for my apt. I got there 30 min early for my 12:30 apt and they didn't even move my car to a bay until 12:45...i asked the guy how long it would take and he told me about 45 min. That was a lie. I get the car back and they hadn't even filled up the tires like I had asked them to do. I literally went in for an oil change and tire rotation. This was pathetic service. ,1.0

7,"September 25, 2015","I knew what I wanted--an affordable truck--and I was not pressured to add costly features. I was in a hurry and things were done quickly and efficiently. Discussion about the price of the new truck and the allowance on my trade was straightforward. Extended warranty and service plan options were clearly explained. Once the new Tundra was ordered, I was kept informed regarding the arrival date and there was no hassle when I brought in my trade and switched. ",4.8
8,"July 12, 2015","First off. I don't write reviews. Ever. But I will make an exception here. Loving Mazda in Lufkin sold my dad the works on a little hatchback CX-5. I think he financed around 35K on the car. I was hot when I found out because my dad has Frontal Lobe dementia and cant speak or write. In fact he cant drive now, less than a year after buying the car from Loving. Before I go any further let me say that I was in the process of moving my dad out of the area when I first approached the Loving dealerships. It was an extremely weird and awful time for me in my life because of the stress I was taking on by moving my dad out of his home. I explained to Loving that I wanted to get my dad into a different car that would make sense for us (we were moving into the mountains of Colorado). To make a very long story short...They ignored me; they waited for me to call repeatedly before making any effort to find a suitable vehicle. And when one was found, I drove to Lufkin and it wasn't on the lot.  By this time I was desperate because we were leaving town and I had to tow his belongings back to my house. In my desperation I traded his car in for something else. And, I was jerked around for hours waiting for a trade value, the process was miss-managed and convoluted. I was lied to about the towing capacity, mislead about the interest rate and generally treated like I was in the way. Why in the xxxx I ever let myself fall for it I'll never know. I can say this about Loving, they know how to make tons of money off of gullible people that are hurting like I was at the time.  In fact, even after writing a letter to upper management they still ignore me to this day. If your looking for a company with 0 integrity and an eye for stuffing their own pockets then find a Loving dealership near you and buy a car from them. They will love your money all the way to the bank.",1.0
9,"January 30, 2015","Prior to going to Loving Toyota in Lufkin, I had bad experiences with car dealerships.  I was MORE than pleased with their very helpful and caring staff. I got exactly what I wanted and I didn't feel pressured at all. They worked hard to get me the best deal possible. I recommend this dealership to everyone from first time buyers to experienced buyers.",5.0
10,"July 03, 2014",Trey and Paula at this dealership will lie to you if you do not use the sales man name Scott. I bought a 2013 toyota and was told to keep it a year an I could trade it back in. But when it comes to trade it in Paula and trey are full of it. Trey will laugh in ur face and tell u bs. Paula will lie and go back on her world. Then when u ask to talk to mr loving trey will laugh at u and say that he answer to him. Well I'm sorry but I will never buy a car from loving toyota in lufkin Texas ever agian. Yes they have nice people working there but the three that is name in this makes it a bad dealership. ,1.0
11,"April 07, 2014","I traded in a 2013 Avalon XLS on a 2014 Avalon Limited. In the negotiation for the trade in value of the 2013 I was told that the most that could be given on the car was $26,000 with just over 20K miles. It had some miner bug damage on the front bumper and hood. I was told by Mr. Honeywell that they were going to spend $1500 to have it repainted so they could give the vehicle the Toyota Certified Guarantee.

Upon returning to the dealership after two weeks, I found my car on the Toyota Certified Guarantee used car lot with a front license plate stating it was Certified. The car bumper and hood was not painted and it was listed for $32,995. They are also advertising it on their Website as a Limited Edition when it is an XLS. I was so mad that I spoke to everyone from the salesman to the general manager asking for my $1500 that I feel like they dishonestly misled me so they could give me less for my trade in. I was given a long list of excuses from it was scheduled to be painted to there was not enough room to store the car in the rear of the dealership which I verified was untruthful.

After talking to the general manager Robert Gill he said there was no way that he was going to return my $1500 which is why I am writing this review. I was also denied access to the owner of the dealership Mr. Joe Loving .   BUYER BE AWARE!!!!!",1.0

13,"December 01, 2013","To Whom It May Concern,

We went to Lufkin Toyota and worked with them for a couple of days to be sure we all understood the packages and options we wanted. Lufkin Toyota does not want to do business and after the experience we received Friday, 29 November 2013, we will not be doing any business with them again in this lifetime. Their dealership is the most unprofessional, rudest bunch of people I have ever met.
I waited patiently for my brother and sister to finish up their truck buying. After a couple hours went by, I became impatient and joined them at the dealership to see what the hold up was. When I arrived I found the one that is responsible for making offers on trade-ins cooking a turkey in the side lot with two other workers. After checking out their cooking methods and having friendly conversations with them he informed us he would be right there to help us. More time went by and still he did not come. After talking to another salesman and venting my frustrations about the whole situation he directed me to another salesman. It was very obvious the man was inside enjoying his turkey and still eating his meal when he approached us. It was very unprofessional and rude to say the least.  
Once the man got to the truck to review our trade-in, I explained we were going to check with some other dealerships to see what they could offer and he became very defensive. He informed me that if we bought a Toyota from any other dealership besides his, that his dealership would not be able to service it for us. He also informed me that I was wasting his time for having him review our trade-in only go to another dealership that could or would under sell his prices. 
Personally if the guy would have been respectful and treated me as a customer and not like someone who interrupted his lunch and turkey-cooking, we would have bought the truck that day and been on our way, despite our time being wasted while we waited for them to cook and then eat said turkey.
I was aggravated but tried to brush that guy off, then went back inside to talk with another salesman, who finally gave us his best price for the truck which truthfully was the MSRP.  Had we known that, we would have not wasted so much of our time or his. The trade in value was ok and was more than our bottom dollar preset before we got there. Then when we thanked him for his time and began to leave. He also became very rude and unprofessional. We did not need him to try and strong arm us into buying the truck. If the dealership had just shown us some common courtesy and professionalism the trade would have been done. 

FYI, I warn you if you want a fair trade, to be treated with respect, and deal with professional people do not go to Loving Toyota in Lufkin, TX, because they do not deal in this manner. They will lie to you, take advantage of you, and be rude to you just because they can.  In my opinion, rating them at 1 star would be too much.

----------THIS IS A FOLLOW UP REVIEW TO THE ONE I POSTED A FEW DAYS BACK:----------

To Whom It May Concern:

After getting bad customer service at Loving Toyota in Lufkin, TX, I emailed sixteen other Toyota dealerships in the East Texas area to see if anyone else would like to sell me a 2014 Toyota Tundra. After several dealerships responded with their best prices, there were two that stood out from the rest.

Danny Cole‚Äôs in Marshall, Texas and Fred Haas in Spring, Texas, both came in with great prices and one came back with an offer on our trade-in that we could not turn down. Danny Cole‚Äôs in Marshall, Texas end up saving us $6,723.00 more than what Loving Toyota in Lufkin, TX offered us for the same 2014 Toyota Tundra and the same trade-in.

Fred Haas in Spring, Texas also offered us best price on the 2014 Toyota Tundra but their offer on our trade-in was $2,000 less than what Danny Cole‚Äôs offered us.

So, long story short, if you‚Äôre looking for a great deal at the best price, go to Danny Cole‚Äôs in Marshall, Texas or Fred Haas in Spring, Texas. Both of these dealerships are professional, know how to treat a customer, and will offer you a fair price on a new vehicle.

Best regards,

14,"August 17, 2013","Best dealership I have ever dealt with - we requested a truck that wasn't on their lot around 5 pm on a Friday & they had it at the dealership cleaned up & ready the next day. No one else would even entertain the idea when we talked to them. The dealership was clean, had a great selection & everyone was so friendly. They also had the best price that we found within 150 miles. Highly, highly recommend. ",5.0
15,"March 19, 2013","I bought a new Prius last spring. The sales experience was great. I got a fair price for my trade in (more than Car Max offered) and the car I wanted. I really liked the sales person - I think his name was Serven.

The service department, on the othar hand, cannot be trusted. The services writer told me the car needed the transmission and radiator fluids changed at 30,000 miles at a cost of around $500. According to Toyota, it isn't needed until after 100,000 miles.

They also would not help me get a prepaid maintenance issue straightened out. I dealer in another state checked the wrong service when I brought it in for an oil change, costing me one of the prepaid services. The Service Manager told me that it was not their mistake.

The salesman agreed to pay for the oil change out of his own pocket.

In summary, the sales department was great and I can recommend purchjasing a car there. As to service, I will not go back. I go to another dealer over 75 miles farther away.",4.3
16,"November 11, 2012","Went into the dealership just to look around, I met the most amazing salesman/person Nick Gilbert, He was not pushy in anyway. He got to know me and asked what I wanted. I purchased a new Toyota Tundra and absolutely love it. I would totally recommend this dealership. ",5.0
17,"September 26, 2012","Went in three weeks ago to buy a new truck. The worst dealership in the state, My wife and I sat there 2.5 hours with not one piece of paper put in front of us. Better yet when it came time to close they booted us out the door. They did try to call us and I tried to work something out until I just gave up because no one would make a call back on my trade-in so we went some place else. I'm shocked they keep the lights on at this place. ",1.4
