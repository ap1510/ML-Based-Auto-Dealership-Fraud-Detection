2,"March 28, 2019","This is the second time I have bought a vehicle from All American Chevrolet.  I will never be going back to purchase another vehicle there for the fact that Brent Poso is very unprofessional.  Not only did he help with the financing yesterday with my vehicle for my significant other, but also continued to text him after hours till 12 A.M.  This is not only unprofessional and causing a disruption into my own personal life, but this is considered harassment.  They have completely lost my business and if I could return the car today I would definitely do that.",1.0

My 2015 Equinox would not start (thought it might be the battery)called All American Chevrolet of Midland talked to Tom told me to bring it in this morning and they would check it out and get it fixed today.

9,"December 05, 2018","When I went in I know what vehicle I wanted, how it was to be equipped. A unit had just been delivered into inventory. I had to wait 9 days for wheels to come in, but salesman keeped me updated with status. I, unlike some, understood the waiting process and was willing to do so.",5.0
10,"November 28, 2018","I took my 2013 dually in because it was stuck in first gear. I figured from past dealer service experiences that I was probably looking at a 1-2 week wait to get my truck back. I fully understand that thinking given the current work load here in the Permian Basin..... well to my surprise when I walked in I was greeted by a Service Advisor by the name of Michael Fabbri and he told me, after I explained what my perceived problem was with my truck, that they would try and get to it by Friday if possible. I was elated..... beat the heck out of  the 1-2 week I was expecting!!! He offered a courtesy driver to take me out to try and find a rental. I told Michael I would be back to get my personal belongings after I secured a rental vehicle. Well donâ€™t try to get a rental at 1530 hrs and get one on the spot..... donâ€™t happen in West Texas!!!!
When I arrived back at the dealership; with no rental and in full acceptance that I would have to pick up my truck and bring it back at a later date when I found a rental; I was astonished to see that my truck was in the service department with the hood up.... I went into the service area and told them I needed my truck back as I could not find a rental. The service person.... didnâ€™t get his name but he is a big tall bearded fellow, told me he thought they could get right on it and have it out to me today. TOTALLY BLEW MY MIND!!!!
Michael asked if I would like to wait in the waiting area and came to check on me several times. Once Michael got his intel he came to me and got my approval on a price before they did anything. 
I can not thank All American Chevy enough for having the good sense and forethought to hire someone like Michael......This is OLD SCHOOL service advisor protocol.... should be Service Provider but I guess advisor fits better in the world we live in now!
I would HIGHLY RECOMEND, ADVISE, ENCOURAGE, SUGGEST that if you need ANYTHING service related (Chevy) that you pull right on up in that covered parking area and go in the Service Department door and holler.... Hey! Whereâ€™s Michael.....
My mind is still blown!!!!!!!!
10 Star Rating from me!!!!!",5.0

I honestly only came to this location expecting professional and great service but got the total opposite:( I was told itâ€™d be ready in 6days and it wasnâ€™t ready till 3weeks later! And to have to come back because of ridiculous mistakes these people made and I feel like they simply donâ€™t care! I would never leave a bad review but in this case I just canâ€™t help it Iâ€™m frustrated and hurt that they have me here acting like Iâ€™m the only one seeing the paint job has bubbles on it I have a brand new vehicle and after it being serviced here it now looks like a wrecked car with a xxxxty paint job :( this place is ridiculous you definitely donâ€™t get what you pay for!!

34,"September 28, 2017","We visited AAC, 6:00 in the evening, to inquire about an used ford truck posted online. We were passed onto a gentleman, that told us where it would be if it was still on the property. We cruised around, didn't see it.  We got off, again, and the gentleman passed us on to Adrian. On the way out, Adrian was very sincere and knowledgeable of the vehicle we were inquiring about. It had sold just days before. He asked pertinent questions regarding our preference for a Ford, after all, we were at a Chevy House. He was very respectful and informative of the chevys on the lot. After traveling all day, looking for the perfect truck, we were bummed about the ford selling, as it was priced very fair, and was THE one. We really thought we would never go back to AAC. 

We cruised to Rogers Ford, next door. Couldn't find anyone. My husband went back to Adrian, as he was interested in seeing this truck Adrian thought would be comparable. Adrian was screwing on dealer tags when we found him. He was so kind and juggled his role nicely and respectfully. 

He test drove the vehicle with us, and took time to get to know our family and how we would use this truck for our family. He tailored his teaching of the trucks features to our lifestyle. We were so impressed with his salesmanship. Again, we had spoke with several that day. 

Adrian was very straight forward about the truck, it's features, the pricing, and the process. We were happy to purchase from Adrian, and his team member Joel. They both were very hospitable, honest, patient, and made the process light and enjoyable. ",5.0

64,"January 12, 2017","This summer I finally bought my dream car, a corvette. It's used but was purchased in great condition with approximately 1,215 miles. After I had it for about a week I came to learn that there as a recall on that particular model. Fixing the problem would require disassembly of the headliner and sun visors. So I took it to All-American Chevrolet of Midland, Texas. Hey - they're a Chevrolet dealership and therefore would have trustworthy and competent technicians doing the work on my pride and joy, right? NO. 
The car was there about 3 weeks. That wasn't a problem though. Car dealerships are busy places. Anyay, I stopped by one afternoon to check on the progress (really they told me after I dropped it off that it would be ready by the end of the week. I'd show up and it wouldn't be. That happened a couple of times.) On one of those occasions I got to talking to the guy in the service department. He appeared to be a real automotive enthusiast and bragged about how he and the other guys liked to thrash the sporty cars that come in for service at All-American when they ""move them around on the lot"" or bring them back to the front for delivery to customers. That was a little disconcerting. 
Well the day finally came when the work was complete and I got the call to come get my car. They had said they would wash it. It was filthy. Not a big deal. I was just happy to finally have transportation again. The interior of the car was reassembled and I assumed the relatively simple work had been completed effectively. The interior lights on my new car have not worked since then, and the engine still makes a noise it never made before.
After having the work done, I was told by other Chevrolet owners in Midland that you should never take your car to All-American for service. I wish I had known that before. So to anybody out there needing work on your new or newer Chevrolet - take it some place else if you care about it. Thanks.",1.4

90,"September 19, 2016","A simple oil change takes two hours. Another time I had dropped my truck off to have the thermostat changed to fix my heater before leaving on a vacation. Simple fix. An hour at best. Two weeks later when I got home it still wasn't done. The staff is nice but the service department is a joke. I don't care if my oil changes are free, I'll be paying to have them done somewhere else. Every time I think I'll give them one more chance, maybe it was an off day. And they remind me that this is not the case.

100,"January 18, 2016","I began searching for a new and or used car several months ago, test driving the new 2016 Honda Civic EX Turbo, 2015 Nissan Altima, 2016 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid, and even a 2015 Toyota 4 Runner. Of all these new cars, I highly recommend the Civic, winner of the 2016 North American car of the year, a far more prestigious award than a single magazine can ever award.  However, I soon realized that buying a good used car a few years old offers far more value than  you will ever get buying a new car, regardless of the brand.  If you are buying a used car, Honda and Toyota, in my humble opinion have the best track records for long term reliability and  resale value.  I also wanted a hybrid, because of their efficiency and low cost ownership.  Most people don't realize this, but brake pads last much longer on a hybrid and the starters on these cars are extremely durable and reliable.  They have to be, because of the thousands of cycles engaged by the start/stop engineering system.  Additionally, by capturing the heat and storing this energy for use later during the brake regeneration, the brake pads have a much longer life.  Uncaptured heat deterioates brake pads much more quickly in a normal gas engine. 
       Well, after much research, I began looking for a 2013-2015 Toyota Avalon Hybrid.  It met all of my needs, had great styling, luxury, room, reliability, durability, resale value, a large trunk for a hybrid at 14 cu. feet, and had a combined epa mpg of 40.   Remember, Toyota invented the hybrid.   Since I work for a major airlines, I began searching nationwide at several major used car websites.  I was willing to buy from an owner or dealer, as long as the price was right.   When I saw this 2014 Toyota Avalon Hybrid Limited for only $22,877 I knew I had a winner.  FYI, the cars lists for over $44,000 new.
So, I called my credit union and was able to secure 1.9% financing for 48 months.  Jesus assisted me, stating we can do everything over the phone and internet  and you can pick up your car the next day.
He was absolutely right.  My credit union faxed the forms to me, I signed and dated them and emailed them back in a pdf attachment.  I financed sales tax, license, all fees and did not have to pay anything down.  Of course, my excellent credit rating allowed all of this to transpire.  I called my insurance company and added this car to my policy.  
      Jesus picked me and my girlfriend up at the Midland airport on Saturday, the next day.  He handed me the keys right off the bat and I drove the car to the dealership with my girlfriend next to me in the front seat.  He asked if we were hungry and offered us hamburgers with Dr Pepper to drink.   After all, this is the All-American Chevy dealer in Midland and this was an All-American lunch.  
Kylie had us sign the remaining papers in the finance office, explaining everything before I even signed it.  She gave me copies of all the signed papers and then Jesus showed me how to operate most of the major controls in the Avalon.  He even paired our phones and entered my home address  into the navigation system.  We left for San Antonio in a clean car with a full tank of gas and huge smiles.  One final note, I did not think this car had the optional technology package until I began driving home.   After I engaged the cruise control and was talking to my girlfriend, the car suddenly braked on it's own.  Evidently, I was getting too close to the car in front of me.  This technology package also includes automatic bright lights.  The car also has a rear spoiler.  The only option it did not have were the 18 inch wheels.   Quite frankly, they make the car ride rougher according to most expert reviewers and are  a poor value for $1,799.  
     In summary, this was by far the best car buying experience I have ever had.  
I was able to buy a great used car not far from my home at a really good price and Jesus made everything so easy.  I highly recommend the All American Chevy dealer in Midland, Tx.

110,"May 21, 2015","We went in to the dealership 3 different times interested in a new Chevy Silverado 1500.  We weren't really ready to buy the first two times we were there, and our experience was fine.  We went in the third time, finally ready to buy, with a solid comparison to another truck we were offered in Austin.  They were able to find us close to the same truck on their lot, so we decided to sit down and negotiate.  Their first offer was literally $12K more than the truck in Austin, so we laughed at that.  After about two hours of back and forth and waiting around for what seemed like days, they ended up coming down to around $35K, which was just a couple thousand more than the Austin truck.  Still out of our price range, we decided to leave, but with no hard feelings.  Dax was very friendly and nice to work with and we left disappointed but not angry at all with the dealership for not being able to meet our price.  Once we got home, after much discussion, we decided that the end price they offered was doable, so we called Dave (the general mgr or owner) to let him know that we wanted to come back and get the truck.  The receptionist told us he was with a customer but would call us right back.  This was at 4:30pm on a Saturday afternoon.  5:30pm rolled around and we still hadn't heard anything, so we called again and were told he was still with the same customer but he would definitely call us back.  7:30 rolls around (THREE hours after we called back), and I convince my already fed up husband to call one more time.....this time the receptionist puts us on hold to go find Dave.  She tells us that she just spoke with him and he will call us back in 2 minutes.  We literally never heard back.  We called to buy a truck, and the call was literally never returned.  After wasting about 8 hours of our day, we went to Austin the next week and bought the exact same truck for $2000 less than Midland was offering.  I wouldn't ever buy a car out here, especially not from here.  We also plan to drive to Odessa for our servicing needs.",1.2
111,"March 25, 2015","Have been a loyal customer for 20 plus years, have bought multiple new cars here. Came in recently to purchase a Traverse or similar and was treated horribly! After selecting the vehicle I wanted was told my payments were twice as what was expected! One glance at the paperwork showed they were adding $20,000 onto the price of the Traverse! When I pointed this out and started to leave I was told that I was ""upside down that much"" on a Malibu I had purchased 3 years ago THERE! I was then told I can search elsewhere. I explained to Carlos that if I purchased elsewhere I would never be back, at which time he said he agreed and understood. Two days later I purchased a new Buick Enclave in Abilene for EXACTLY what Carlos reported I would never be able to do. So, thus ending a 20+ year relationship. Hope it was worth it! Go somewhere else and check around! Familiarity is not always best! BUYER BEWARE!",1.8
112,"January 30, 2015","Went in to check out Silverados and I don't think it could have taken any longer than it did. I was interested in a very close set of requirements and it took 3-4 hours to find it, fill out any sort of paperwork, negotiate the price, or anything else punctuated by long periods of waiting around doing absolutely nothing. 

It took so long the first day that we had to return again the next day after getting preapproved for a loan at a bank. After many hours of waiting yet again, they tried to push us to dealer financing at an outrageous 6 percent (bank gave us 1.8) despite having been told we had our own financing previously, so they wasted my time preparing the paperwork for it. Finally, after several hours more waiting, the final paperwork was ready to be signed and I took the truck home which only started another circus

The 'new' truck was dirty and hadn't been washed, and after I personally washed it I discovered numerous swirl marks in the paint. One key was missing and has yet to be replaced multiple weeks later though this was disclosed upon sale. There were charcoal briquettes in the bed and I found a fingernail clipping next to one of the air vents (really?). After airing up the tires (which had low pressure), I found a huge dent that had been concealed by mud, and discovered that the odometer was off by a factor of two from the disclosure statement. Yet again, I had to return to the dealership.

After yet another significant wait, they agreed to pay to repair the dent and fixed the mileage form/title the next day. Their explanation for the mileage discrepancy was a clerical error or that it was from another dealership when the evidence points to it having been a loaner, demo, or employee joy ride despite denials (1k+ miles on a new vehicle that has been on your lot since manufacture? yeah okay.). I dropped the truck off a few days later at the body shop only to discover that no one had actually submitted the necessary paperwork authorizing the repair, and that the body shop people had no idea what I was talking about. This lead to yet another hour+ long wait as the problem was sorted out wherein I was told I could leave the truck there to be repaired. 

At this point, the finance side of the operation had to be asked multiple times to send the buy order to the bank so they could approve my loan.

So, after 5+ days of my truck being at the bodyshop, I called and asked what the status of the repair was only to be told that no one had actually submitted any paperwork so I had just been without a vehicle for 5 days for no reason without any notification that something was wrong. Great. So yet another trip to the dealership to talk to a manager wherein he discovered that someone dropped the ball and the sales manager hadn't gotten and/or submitted the paperwork. Even more waiting. Finally, it seems to have been sorted out and I received an estimate for repairing the dent and a date to drop the truck off.

The new date to drop off the truck was rescheduled to a later date by the body shop adding another several days. Finally, I was able to drop the truck off to be repaired and left. Another 5 days later, I call the body shop to check the status of the repair and initially have a difficult time actually getting a hold of anyone in the body shop. The next day, I attempted to call again and was told that the status would be checked and I would be called back shortly. I was never called back. This happened three times. Finally, I was told that the truck was in paint and ostensibly would be ready shortly. The next day I called again, had difficulty reaching anyone again with another 'we'll check and call you back shortly' fail. Finally after reaching someone, I find out that the truck wasn't actually in paint and is only now in paint so add 3 more days to the ETA because they're closed on the weekends. 

After waiting through the weekend, I called on Monday when it was supposed to be ready. Surprise, surprise. It wasn't. ""It will be ready tomorrow, we will call you when it is"". So the next day comes around, and I wait for the phone call. Completely unsurprisingly and in line with all the other phone calls, they never actually called me. I called an hour before they closed and lo and behold it was indeed ready. Hallelujah, the crisis is over right? Nope.

I drive over to pick it up and the first thing I notice is a bunch of new swirl marks in the paint where they had washed it improperly. Furthermore, they forgot to replace 4x4 sticker on the replaced panel. I go in, and apparently the person who was in charge of my repair is not there that day so they struggle for 10 minutes to find my paperwork so I can just leave.

After getting my keys and leaving the lot with my vehicle, I turned on my left blinker only to discover that it is not working properly with a message on the dash. They screwed up the wiring when replacing the rear panel. Fantastic. So I get to drop my vehicle off at the dealership yet again, for who knows how long. They said it would only take a day to rectify, but since every single other estimate has been incorrect, who knows.

Not a single aspect of the sale went well. The scratched/dented condition of the 'new' vehicle, the loss of paperwork, the required multiple trips to the dealership, the incompetence of the body shop, and the seemingly terrible organizational structure wherein I must have talked to 5-6 people for hours were all unacceptable. So far, I estimate at least 8+ hours spent waiting at the dealership or attempting phone calls. 

Absolute nightmare of an experience. I will not ever do business with the dealership again, and I will recommend everyone I know to stay far, far away.

The only positive part of the experience was the help of one of the Sales Managers, Lionel Jones.",1.4

115,"September 23, 2014","We came in looking for a used truck in the low $20,000s.  We were very clear about our requirements: $25,000 max with no down payment aside from our trade in.  Explained to Gina that we didn't care what brand or color, just that it be a four door with decent leg room as we have two growing children.

Two hours of gritting my teeth as she ignores me and speaks only to my husband later we finally get the price of the truck she's pushing on us.  $28,995, and they want a $2500 down payment!  No, we already told you our max is $25,000 and there is no down payment.  

This led to more nonsense that lead nowhere until we had to leave to pick up our children.  ""Just ten minutes"" she says, and since she still has the key to our vehicle we said fine, but after that we MUST leave.  Ten minutes are up, she is nowhere to be seen, so we get up and start heading to the door to see if that will get her attention.  It got someone's attention, I assume from what came next he was supposed to be the good cop to her bad.  

Eventually I had to physically take the key to our vehicle out of his hand where he was fidgeting with it. ""Oh is this yours?""  Yes, and we are leaving NOW.

The finance guy-Brendan, wrote on a blank piece of paper the 'numbers', then slid contract over for signatures. It was pretty slick actually, practiced theft as it turned out.
When I brought this to the attention of the dealership, I was ignored, then when I attempted to get a solution through the BBB, they blew off the BBB and me.

Like having surgery and having the hospital that stitches are optional. No more flying under the radar for All American Midland.

DO NOT BUY HERE. You've been warned.",1.0
