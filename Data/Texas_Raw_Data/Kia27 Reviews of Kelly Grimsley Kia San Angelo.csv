7,"September 19, 2019","Man let me tell you that purchasing a car from Kelly Grimsley is always great Charles and his staff are awesome people to work with and I‚Äôm not gonna tell you that they treat you like family that‚Äôs so lame. But I will say that they value your time and Patronage and listen to what you‚Äôre looking for and the payment you can afford. I just purchase my second Kia Optima and will continue buying from them cause of the great people like Charles the manager and Dwayne who helped me with my car and theirs Ricky another salesman who can help you and then theirs the service writer guys Chance and Bryan who‚Äôll take care of you when you need your car serviced.

19,"March 09, 2019","First I would like to say,  that any dealership I've gone to. I would try to avoid the salesman because they could be pushy and don't take no for an answer. I'm the type that if I see a salesman coming I would just drive away. The experience I have had with other dealerships have just been stressful. You tell them you want one car, but they want you to buy a new car. They always say I can't approve you for this one, but I can get you this one. With that being said with Kelly Grimsly Kia, This has been the second time, I have bought a vehicle at this dealership. Robert Lopez, was such a great salesman. He let me take my time and help me test drive several cars. He didn't ask for my information right way. He didn't suggest another car.  Once I made my decision,  he worked very hard to get the payment I was comfortable with.  Robert made buying my car super easy and not stressful at all. ",5.0

Professional, courteous, and a very positive experience with him and Charles, the general manager. I highly recommend this dealership to anyone who is looking for a great experience in buying a car",5.0
