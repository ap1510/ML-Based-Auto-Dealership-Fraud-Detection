1,"June 02, 2020","The whole process was easy. With the coronavirus restrictions I called ahead and told them what we were interested in. Todd Parker had it waiting when we arrived. It was what we were looking for, the price was right and I got what I needed for my trade, Thanks to Todd, Dana, all the staff at Jim bass. Great deal.",5.0
2,"May 06, 2020","I found the exact car I wanted online and at a great price.  I live 183 miles away from the dealership.  I took care of the details over the phone.  Everyone I spoke to was extremely nice and helpful.   One of the two salesmen I spoke to asked me if I was interested in purchasing a “Mazda Wrap Warranty” of which I declined.  I was not asked if I wanted to purchase anything else. Over the cost of the car.   I drove the thee hours to pick up the car and when I arrived everything was ready to go, all I had to do was sign the paperwork.  It was the easiest car purchase I have ever made.  While going over the finances, the finance manager quickly tried the pass over the “Pro Package” for $599.00 already figured into the purchase price.  I asked him what that was, and he said that it included wheel locks, nitrogen in the tires, and Chrystal Fusion for the windshield.  I told him that I did not ask for the “Pro Package” and was not asked if I wanted it.  The finance manager asked the salesman about it and he shrugged his shoulders and never gave an answer.  What was I going to do at that point, wait until they deflated the nitrogen out of the tires and refilled them with air, wait until the removed the wheel locks, wait while they removed the Chrystal Fusion from the windshield, wait until they changed all the financing to remove the $599.00?  Genuine Mazda wheel locks cost $48.00.  It costs up to $180.00 to fill tries with nitrogen.  That leaves $371.00.  Who knows what the Chrystal Fusion cost?   What would have been a great car buying experience is not so great with the “Pro Package” almost forced on me.  What makes me more and more mad about this, is that I sat there and signed the papers.  I should have gone home, but I drove three hours there and had to drive three hours back.  I guess I should not complain, I was the one who signed the papers.",3.6

9,"January 27, 2020","Adam Tiner, was the guy who helped me get into my new F150. He was patient and he was knowledgeable. I was unable to go into the dealership until I felt confident in the deal. Adam worked with me over the phone and got the deal set up! Based on Mr. Tiner, I am led to believe that the staff at Jim Bass Ford in San Angelo, TX are the best around. Thanks again.",4.8
10,"January 15, 2020","I came in looking for a specific used vehicle I had seen listed online on their website. I was shown financing options asked what specificity I liked or needed with this particular make and model and was asked if I’d want to consider looking at financing for a year newer (so new) vehicle in the same make and model as it’d only be around $3,000 more and financing would be better so the monthly payments would come out to maybe only $20-$30 more a month and I’d get a better warranty. Stan listened to my questions and provided answers without making me feel like I was pressured to go with a new verses used vehicle. He also helped get my monthly payments to the initial amount I came in saying I wanted to stay under. ",5.0
11,"January 13, 2020",We have purchased 5 new vehicles and one used car since we moved back to San Angelo in 2016.  Each purchase has been amazing and effortless. I would highly recommend JBF.  ,5.0
12,"January 13, 2020","Bought a lightly used Honda CR-V. Due to some less than fun experiences with other dealers, I limited my research to internet and a few email inquiries. Found the CR-V I ultimately bought on the internet and went to San Angelo and Jim Bass Ford to test drive the car. Sorry I didn’t spend more time with the dealers salesmen. They were excellent. Helpful, informative and responsive to my needs. Actually included two keys and an owner’s manual with the used car. Answered important questions by email before our visit. If you have interest in a new or used car at a Jim Bass dealership, contact a representative for exceptional service.",5.0

Then after driving it and Joe showing my son and me all of the extras on it that I hadn't had before, I was sold.  I planned to just go vehicle shopping but I felt nothing would change my mind and just be a waste of time.  I hope I won't be disappointed and I don't think I will be.",5.0

23,"November 08, 2019","Was looking for a truck for my son's graduation and came across a 2018 F-150 at Jim Bass Ford.  Butch Lands first caught me in the lot looking (he's in charge of inventory).  We talked about what I was looking for and told me the difference in a CPO and the other trucks on the lot.  He hunted down Mike Smith for me once we finished talking.  Worked with Mike Smith, as I always do, and we had a deal wrapped up in under an hour.  Chon took care of all the paper work and I was out in under a couple of hours total.  Whenever I look for a truck, this is the first place I look and Mike is the first dealer I talk to.",5.0

26,"September 24, 2019","My wife and I just bought our 3rd new vehicle from Jim Bass in the past year.  I was not intending to purchase a new truck, but saw the ""buy a newer vehicle for less or the same payment"" advertisement on TV.  I went online and filled out the form and got a call from Todd Parker 30 minutes later asking me ""when are you going to come get your new truck?""  The ad was legit, and I drove off the lot today with a new truck at the nearly the same price as my 2018 truck...same type truck plus 4x4...nicer truck, near the previous payment.  Thank you Todd Parker and Chon Munoz!",5.0
27,"September 23, 2019",We bought a car from Jim Bass Ford in San Angelo recently. Our salesman Mike Smith was exceptional from beginning to end. He made it extremely easy to buy a vehicle. He went above and beyond to show us features of the car even with it being past time for him to get off work. We dealt with two finance people and both were friendly and helpful answering all our questions. This is the second vehicle in a row we have bought from Jim Bass Ford/Nissan. We have had great customer service both times with our salesman and every person we dealt with during the buying process. ,5.0

29,"September 04, 2019","This is a ok dealership. Pay attention to the price they quote because the only way to get the quote is to finance at a high interest. I went through Ford Motor Credit and did not get the price that was quoted. I was quoted over the phone 40,426 and Car Gurus showed 40,926 but since I financed through Ford Motor Credit the price was 43,867. That is a little disappointing since the salesman on the phone did not say that the price was depending on who you finance through. ",3.3
30,"August 27, 2019","I had Andrew approach me while I was looking around the lot and he showed me this one Nissan vehicle and that was all it took, I hadn't really planned on purchasing, but you know how that is when you find something with ALL the bells and whistles you wanted and this one had them all. I had be playing with the idea of buying a Jeep Grand Cherokee but they didn't have a C D player in them or the color of vehicle I wanted and I just don't really like the Dodge dealership, my personal preference, the Nissan Rogue had a C D player, lift gate, sun roof or moon roof whatever, nice leather seats and I think that's what sold me I LOVED loved the color, thanks Andrew I had fun shopping with you, I will forsure send any business your way Laurie Wood Cowley",4.8

My hats off to Candi for his professionalism in getting things taken care of and his honesty. He made sure we were taken care of before we left and answered all my questions.

44,"March 19, 2019",Salesman was very friendly and patient with us while we were looking for a new car. Very helpful in helping us choose one and knowledgeable about the vehicles we looked at also. Took his time with us and didn’t push us into buying the first one we drove. He knew a lot about the cars we drove and told us a lot about them. (Very helpful for us). Didn’t feel like we had to hurry up and make a purchase. ,5.0
45,"March 16, 2019","Wow. They must delete negative comments from facebook or something, because , my wife and i went in there with our hat in our hands and everything (to the penny) that we had. Upon discovering how much they could get from us credit wise (not much) we were shown the vehicles in our price range. First i was informed about a feature that ""came"" with my car called ""Crystal fusion"" .. magic stuff that is (fake statistic) times better than Rain-x.. and you get your windshield fixed or replaced if it incurs damage.... cool right? ""Crystal Fusion"" is made of the exact same polysiloxane polymer as Rain-x , as a matter of fact, xxxx near criminally so. it was presented as ""comes with my car""...feeding on my assumption that it was a manufacturers feature instead of , ""we sprayed(or didn't no proof) on the car your looking at so it ""comes"" with it....and by with it, he meant with a 599.00 windshield replacement and snake oil squirting contract ,even though we both knew we had to have full coverage to leave the lot financed. look out. CRYSTAL FUSION is the new ""undercoating"" . there must be a nice bonus incentive in place for the underhanded delivery.    the vehicle came from the factory with 5 year drive train, bumper to bumper, and roadside assistance.. included in my itemized recipt was a 2155.00 extended service plan that i did not know i was buying as he kept using assuring tones of ease and comfort as he slid paper after paper to be signed...stating.... this is just for this... this is just for that. Then! they screwed us. With not even knowing if we could even get a car they assured us they could cut and squeeze to help us out.. if we didnt get a car there..our little family's first new car... then we were going to have to buy a 2000 dollar hunk of junk from a private citzen until that broke. we needed a light at the end of a tunnel. But the train saw suckers on the track.... that's not all folks!   we were stuck with all TT&L costs and our 21,415 msrp car is costing us 28,029. thanks for the ""help!"" Ryan.... and p.s. bro, nitrogen is a smaller molecule than oxygen and therefore denser. (reference from b.s. nitrogen in tires distraction)   UPDATE. The morning after I left this review on their fb, I recieved a 9 am call from Dana the social media pitbull confronting me very aggressively about my opinion and told me that what had happened to me and my wife didnt happen. He threatened and when I clarified his intent he recanted.  Well they cant delete this one... Nor every other I will now post thanksvto Dana's ""courtesy"" call. I cant wait to look this dude in the eye on our appointment monday.",1.8

58,"August 02, 2017","I had a TERRIBLE sales experience with Jim Bass Ford last year so we went to the Ford Dealer in Sweetwater Texas which was the BEST car buying experience I've ever had. We decided convenience over the drive back to Sweetwater for our first oil change thinking it's just an oil change...the oil change / wheel rotation guy put several large scratches into my passengers side painted alloy wheel. They said they would fix it 'free of charge', well I would expect to get it fixed for 'free' since they messed it up. I also asked that they compensate me for my time that I have to waste bringing my new Explorer back to get the wheel etched and repainted. The 'Service Manger' said they would not ""buy my Loyalty"". They said they would pay for my car rental, but it's an in house rental anyway so how is that any type of compensation? Jim Bass won't retain my business. The service manager didn't even have the decency to talk to me personally, customer service is non existent.

**Update: The repair was done and looked like a teenager with sandpaper and a can of gray spray paint 'fixed' the wheel. I was again upset and dissapointed. They handed me my car key and said my car was around the corner; no review or any concern for my opinion. I returned to the service desk and demanded to speak to the service manager. The service gentleman (the actual service employees are great) asked to see what I was upset about and agreed the repair was garbage. The service manager returned from his lunch, didn't introduce himself, didn't shake my hand, just stooped to look at the repair. He stood and asked the service gent if they had my info and to order a new wheel. He turned to me and I had to ask who he was, at that point he introduced himself and said he would take care of me. Two days later they put a new wheel on and my new car is back to looking new.

**The only employee the cares about customer service is Tony Martinez, throughout this whole process he has been an amazingly patient and understanding individual. They should get lessons on customer service from him.",1.4

61,"August 07, 2016","I searched high and low, nationwide, on the internet for my dream, 2010 Explorer, 4x4, V-8, either a Limited or Eddie Bauer.  I found my dream here , before my salesman (Charlie Mijares) even knew it was on the lot.  Man, am I happy he decided to check that out, after he had already told me they didn't have that vehicle.  Charlie was a great guy to deal with.  I was a little unhappy with how long it took finance to do their job though.  It took a full day to purchase this vehicle.  It was worth the wait though for a vehicle that is almost impossible to find.  She only had 19,038 miles on her, with documentation showing oil changes every 1500-2800 miles, and she was a 1 owner.   She had every option I've ever heard of on an Explorer and more.  I did not know that any vehicle had a hard disk drive.  I was shocked to find out that I can save every song, from every one of my over 300 CD's on that HDD, and have them at my disposal whenever I like without having to fumble around with my CD's ever again.  One of the most awesome features I've ever had on any vehicle.  LOL  I LOVE my new to me truck.  Thank you Jim Bass Ford.",4.0

I text the salesman that I purchased it from and his response was  (SORRY FOR THE INCONVENIENCE )  And that was it, nothing else.     He didn't offer a tow truck or ask if i needed help with a motel , or anything.     Once they get your money they are done with you.

66,"August 15, 2015","Bought an F-150 in Jan. Salesmen from the nearby J.B. Nissan lot intercepted me in Ford lot. After night of negotiations, showed up the next morning to sign and pick up car. The closing price on final documents was $2500 higher than what agreed. Spent $2,000 to get best warranty available. Had some questions on it. They gave me a tiny two page pamphlet. Sales force was not knowledgeable on my vehicle. It was amateur hour!

Went into today for the ""works service"" which includes oil change and tire rotation. Due to their reputation, I marked one tire so I could verify they did the work I paid for. Wasn't greeted when I walked in. When they pulled up the vehicle for payment, I saw that the tires had not been moved. Pretty shameful. Safe yourself a lot of time and effort and take you vehicle to Arrow Ford in Abilene. They made us feel like superstars about  a year ago when we bought an SUV.",2.0

69,"April 28, 2015",I had such an incredible experience. Trey was the salesperson I had the pleasure of working with. He was very polite and upfront. I would give Jim Bass five stars just on him alone. This is a place you can go to get a good deal on a car. They actually gave me what my car was worth instead of trying to rip me off! I had brought my Mazda3 in to get the front brakes done and while perusing the lot found a charger I was absolutely in love with. Well Trey made it happen. I traded in my Mazda3 (which they covered the brake job I just had done) and drove home with a charger!  Not to mention that the car I bought was not over priced. Their finance department worked with me to ensure I was able to get a good interest rate and was able to drive my new car home that night. I even came back the next day to have the Jim Bass sticker removed from my car and they didn't give me any trouble. I was in and out just like the day I bought the car. I highly suggest that anyone in the market for a new car checks this place out! You will not be disappointed. ,5.0
70,"February 17, 2015","In the 80s, the normal scummy dealer scam was ""undercoating,"" for which they charged 4-10 times the market price.  It was almost a national thing, well known, something to be avoided at all costs.  
I went into Jim Bass Ford to buy a less than 2 year old pickup.  I didn't see what I wanted on the front lot, so the salesman drove me around back to look at 'just arrived, not even cleaned up' trucks.  Found one I liked.  
What do they do?  Decent price, but they added almost $1000 for a tailgate lock and 'windshield coating.'  Seriously?   Tailgate lock was listed at $299 and the windshield coating at several hundred more.  I said, ""I don't need either.""  ""Sorry, sir, they are already installed...""  
""Take them off,"" I said.  ""We can't...""  
The lock - the EXACT lock- sells for $19.99 at Autozone and O'Reillys, and the 'windshield coating' is as useful as undercoating was.  I watched them 'install' the windshield coating on another truck, and it took less than 3 minutes.  AWESOME!
Way to go, Jim Bass, keep the 80s going, and keep on perpetuating the stereotype of Dealers Behaving Badly.

71,"February 06, 2015","I went into Jim Bass Ford, and as a woman I was very surprised at how well I was greeted and walked through everything so thoroughly. The salesman even talked with my young daughter!! A friend of mine shared the same sort of experience, which is why she recommended me to you. I love in Brady and Jim Bass is very much worth the drive for my business! Thank you all",5.0
72,"December 07, 2014",We had bought 3 cars from the Bass Bunch so far so when we decided to buy one for my Mom we of course decided it would be from them. Went down at 10:30 on Fri and asked for our salesman we like to use and he came right out and showed us around the lot at cars he thought would be a good car for my Mom. We found the one we liked and he said give me about an hour and I will work up some numbers and call you back. Not even 30 mins later he called and said the terms we asked for were good and come on down and pick it up!  Drove back down there signed the papers and drove off! It by far is the BEST process dealing with them!  In the past I've dealt with dealerships where I have left the lot saying I'd rather ride a bike then deal with them. That is not the case with the Bass Bunch!  Love how easy they make it and the customer service after the sale is top notch!  We've been dealing with them for over 10 years and we wouldn't buy a car from anyone else!  ,5.0
73,"November 11, 2014","I've been buying cars and trucks from Jim Bass Ford for over 30 years and never once  had a bad experience ! It's actually the only dealership I enjoy visiting because I feel like family the moment I walk into the dealership or service center ! Free Wifi, coffee, newspaper, flat screen TV, free shuttle service if needed and a stress free experience!  Once you start buying from Jim Bass Ford your HOOKED for life!!! Plus the Bass family is very involved with our community and charitable events throughout the year, they love giving back and that even makes another reason why I enjoy shopping and service at Jim Bass Ford!

PS: My son with graduate Texas Tech soon and and I haven't told him about his new truck for graduation :)

74,"September 15, 2014","I saw a truck on their website for 12 thousand. For me and my fiance (just starting out) this was perfect! So I called the dealer, set up a time to come see it 2 days later and test drive it. I gave them my info and the rep on the phone said he would email all his contact info to me. I never got his info. Well, the day of the appointment arrives, and me and my fiance drive an hour and 15 mins to the dealer just to be told they sold the truck the day before. On top of that, we weren't even put into the system for an appointment. On top of THAT, they then had us sitting around for 3 and a half hours so they could see what the best deal they could do for us. Apparently, it was to offer a truck for 7,000 more, with 10,000 in interest. Explain to me, if the truck is 18,988.00, and you do a down payment of 2500.00 (which would bring it down to 16,498.00) and they give you an Apr of 10.2%, a 63 month term, and payments of 456 a month, why that all comes to 9 very 30,000.00?? They're cons. They see young people and try to take advantage of them. They don't have any courtesy, and should just be shut down! Again, if I went in there for a 12,000 dollar truck, what in the xxxx makes someone think I can afford 30,000?? 9th and the truck they tried to sell me for 30k, had almost 100k miles.",1.6

90,"August 17, 2012","What a wonderful experience!  These guys are a class act and went above and beyond anything I have experienced at other dealerships.  This makes the 5th vehicle that my wife and I have purchased from them and each time it gets easier and easier!  We could make the short trip to Austin to possibly get a better price but it is not worth it to us as we live in San Angelo and would be having our service done here on whatever we buy.  This brings me to another aspect of their dealership: service.  Mr. Rose and his crew in service are always willing to help and squeeze us in for a quick oil change or tire rotation each time we need one.  We are always greeted by a friendly face and if we need a ride the shuttle guy, Bill, is always a pleasure to ride with!  The Bass's are wonderful people who, in my opinion, believe in taking care of the customer and reinvest in the community as I always see their name associated with different charities and organizations across the Concho Valley!

This is not the first experience I have had like this with them either.  I purchased my vehicle from them and purchased the warranty through them so I have had to deal them on several occassions now.  My warranty running out will be the best thing that ever happened as I will NEVER EVER go back for anything from them. There are multiple reviews just like mine if you do a little research so before you purchase a vehicle from them or use their service department, please read up and see how they REALLY treat their customers.",1.5

94,"March 27, 2012","I took my Expedition to Jim Bass Ford because the door handle was broken on the passenger side. I thought they might have a part in stock and it would be a quick fix. Although the service guy was pretty helpful, he told me it would take three days to get done AND with a straight face told me it would cost $440 to fix because ""the whole regulator"" had to be replaced. $440 FOR ONE BROKEN DOOR HANDLE. I laughed out loud and left. 

That afternoon my dad and I took fifteen minutes in my driveway to fix it...and I'm not making this up...WITH A 15 CENT ZIP TIE. I didn't even have to buy a replacement part! I used the parts already there. That was six months ago and the door handle is still working fine. NOw, I know that a Ford shop won't want to fix something with a zip tie, but how dishonest is it if the KNOW that I could do that at home FOR FREE and don't tell me? Instead trying to reach into my pocket and STEAL almost $500. 

The WORST part came today, when for the third time received a 1-800 call with no voicemail. I finally called back out of curiousity and it was Jim Bass Ford trying to sell me services!! Can you imagine trying to screw somebody out of almost $500 and then having the nerve to cold call them trying to sell them something else?? Never EVER going there again. Any redneck mechanic who works under a shade tree would be PROUD to tell you he could fix something with a 15 cent zip tie. Not Jim Bass Ford. Screwing you out of your hard earned money seems to be the name of the game there and from reading the above posts I guess I wasn't the only one they tried it on. Buyer and consumer be aware. JIm Bass Ford is a horrible choice. Go ANYWHERE but here. ",2.0

96,"December 16, 2011","An employee of mine took a Ford F350 to Bass Ford because the truck was hesitating and had very little power. He was on the road between Edinburg Texas and Plains Texas. He thought it needed a fuel filter, but Bass Ford told him they thought it was the transmission. They said they would have to charge 300.00 for diagnostics. We agreed to the 300.00 charge, and after diagnostics they told us we needed a new or rebuilt transmission. They would put a new transmission in for 4400.00 or rebuilt for 4100.00.
This price seemed extremely high, so we had the truck towed to Seminole to have the transmission rebuilt for 2,400.00. The only problem was once the company in Seminole started work, he discovered there was nothing wrong with the transmission. He had a company nearby that worked on diesel engines take a look at it, and they told us we needed a fuel filter. They put the filter on for $180.00 and the truck runs great. Too bad I had to pay Bass Ford 300.00, then pay 250.00 to get it towed to Seminole to get that $180.00 filter.

My biggest question is whether the service department at Bass Ford is inept, or were they just trying to rip me off?",1.4
97,"September 29, 2011","I was recently over in San Angelo- 750 miles from home. My vehicle was acting up and it was electrical. I took it to Jim Bass Ford and they told me I needed an alternator, o2 sensor, and fuel pump and it would cost $1500. I told them I just needed to get home, what would get me home? They said an alternator. I told them that Sears checked the alternator and battery and that they were fine. They repeated that was what it needed. So, I told them okay.
I paid $480 for the alternator (which is 1/4 of my monthly income). I got 1 hour out of town at 9pm and my van completely shut down. It wouldn't turn on, the lights wouldn't work, etc. I ended up calling 911 with 4 kids in the car and sitting there for 3 hours waiting for police, a ride, and a tow truck. I had it towed back to JB and they said it started right up and wouldn't fail to start once they jumped it, but now it was over heating and the engine was knocking and I needed to trade it in.
I told them I couldn't afford to do that out of state. They refused to give me a refund and said that I had signed for the alternator. They're lying about what they said to the BBB. And, as of right now, I'm at home from a rent a car which cost almost $300 and my car is in a drive way in San Angelo.
I have owned 4 Ford automobiles in my life- I'm only 33. I can tell you that this will be the last one!

98,"August 17, 2011","The salesman, Butch Strain, was very easy to work with and seemed very willing to work with me. But, because there were NO HYBRIDS on the lot, I was going to place an order for what I wanted. Mr Strain had to check with Mr Bass, one of the owners. 

Mr Bass required a ""non-refundable $500.00 deposit"" before he would allow a Hybrid to be ordered. That was an immediate deal breaker for me since I know any number of things could happen to the Ford Fusion Hybrid I wanted before the delivery.
Mr Bass also seemed like he did not want any Hybrids on their lot at all, which is a real shame, since I really would have liked to keep my business local.

I did buy my Ford Fusion Hybrid from a different dealership that not only would order exactly what I wanted, but required no deposit for the order, worked quite well with me and I received a cheaper price than I was quoted at Jim Bass Ford. I was very pleased with the other dealership and fully intend to contact them when we do look for a new pick-up truck.",1.7
