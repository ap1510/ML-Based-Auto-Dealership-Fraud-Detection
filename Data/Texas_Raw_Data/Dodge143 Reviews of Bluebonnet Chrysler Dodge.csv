0,"December 27, 2019","We were looking at used 2018 RAM 2500 today from Blue Bonnet Dodge and were less than satisfied by their approach to doing business. Their inventory is scattered over multiple lots and was very disorganized. Once we finally tracked down the truck, an employee needed to pull it out of the parking space so that we could go on a test drive. The salesman ensured that the said employee was a ""professional"" when it comes to pulling trucks out of their space. I thought little of the comment due to the simple nature of the task at hand. To my surprise, the employee took a sharp right turn out of the spot and scraped the bed of the truck that we were interested in, into the truck parked next to it, causing damage to both vehicles. There was now a basketball sized dent in the truck with scratches to match. There was little acknowledgement of the incident as if the event was a routine occurrence. The salesman simply said ""that will buff right out."" There was no effort made to ensure that the damage would be fixed before a sale would be made. Needless to say, a sale was not made that day. This is the worst dealership that I have experienced. ",1.8
1,"December 11, 2019","Dishonest, Shady, and Bait and Switch, is how I would describe my experience with Bluebonnet Dodge. I spent 2 days trying to buy a used truck from them.  I agreed to buy the truck for a price that they offered only if it checked out with my mechanic. After paying my mechanic $125.00 and leaving the truck with him all day it was determined that the truck needed close to $1500 worth of safety related mechanical repairs so I returned it to Bluebonnet and told the sales person that I could not pay the agreed upon price due to the repairs needed. The sales person went to Drew and made a counter offer witch included them fixing the safety related mechanical problem (broken steering box). We agreed to an out the door price and we filled out the paperwork to get the money from my bank. While we were waiting for them to complete the paperwork and complete the make ready on the truck DREW approached us and said that he had made a mistake on the price and that the they could not sell us the truck for the agreed upon amount. He then made us another offer that was almost $2000 more or them not repairing the steering box. When we said no and started to leave he made another offer to split the difference and not repair the truck and that it was going to come out of his personal pocket. I  told him that I felt like we had been deceived and that it was all very shady because we had already made a deal. He had actually used white out and changed all of the numbers to on all of the documents that we had already signed. He had covered up the original offer price and had filled in an amount that was $1000 more than their very own original offer. Drew claimed that he was being honest when he claimed to have made a mistake on the paperwork and the he had several other offers on the truck. It's more likely that he had a better offer or someone else or he could pawn the broken truck off on without having to make the repairs. Ironically after reading several reviews online I discovered that this exact same situation has happened to other people at this dealership. Honest mistake or dishonest sales tactics?  This place wreaks of dishonesty and shady deals.

2,"December 26, 2018","We purchased a new 2018 Ram 5500 cab and chassis from BlueBonnet Dodge about 6 weeks ago and our experience through the whole process was less than enjoyable to say the least.

We were always told they would call us back shortly and days would go by before we heard anything we would end up having to call them to get the status of securing the truck. Then securing the loan the same thing, and then even after we had to keep bugging them to finalize the deal with all the paperwork, then once the paperwork finally arrived of course it wasn't correct and had to be amended. 

Finally weeks later the truck was ready for pickup and I flew from Phoenix, AZ to San Antonio, TX to pick up the truck and drive it back. At the last minute Steve changes plans and tells us that he can't meet us to pick up the truck and will hide the keys somewhere for us find them so we can pick the truck up ourselves. He couldn't even take 15-30 mins out of his schedule to meet and greet and shake our hand on the deal and wish us the best with our new truck purchase of $70,000. Though he made his commission off the deal. 

When driving the truck back to AZ we realized the back slider glass window had an air leak causes an annoying whistling noise in the cab the whole way home. Then the cruise control decides to stop working and will only work when it wants to, next the rear parking sensor on the passenger side just start alarming for no reason everytime in reverse. Then the 12 volt phone charger in the front of the cab stop working all together, all which are now our problem and require us to take the truck into only a commercial dealership for repairs and told they need the truck for a week to fix everything.

Meanwhile this is a work truck that has to be on the road to make money every month to afford the monthly payment and commercial insurance required.

Lastly the temporary registration tag runs out on Christmas day and we have not received a permanent plate from AZ motor vehicles, so we call local motor vehicle office and were told they never even received any paperwork regarding the vehicle and that we need to contact the dealership. 

Today I called Steve to inform him and he tells me that he will call me back in 20 mins, about 2hrs later I call the dealership and was told Krystan was busy and would have to call me back, after insisting on talking to him I was transferred to Krystan and explained the situation and was told the lady that handles titles was out of the office and he would have to get back to me, I said fine but I needed a new temporary plate so I can drive the vehicle, he replied no problem I will email one over to you today, perfect!!! 

5pm today we still have not received a temporary plate by email and I received a text message from Steve telling me that they were working on it but still waiting on the title lady which lead me to write this review about my unbelievable experience of the very poor customer service I have received and the far worst of any car dealership experience I have ever had over the last 30 yrs. 

Do yourself the favor and save yourself the aggravation and time wasted and find another dealership that will treat you better then BlueBonnet Dodge ever will or knows how.",1.0
3,"October 27, 2018","This is absolutely the worst dealer I have ever done business with in my 66 years of buying new vehicles. I have had issues with my faulty brakes since I drove my new tuck off of their lot. First they said the brakes just needed seated. Now14,000 miles later and couple trips back to the shop and I still have horrible brakes. Not safe to drive. You can her the lose parts in the brake system. I also just got a notice of my third factory recall. The simply to refused to even take the wheels off and examine these  faulty brakes. I made a service appointment and they didn't even begin look at my truck until 5 days later. They had it for 11 days an did little more than drive it around the block. These people are flat out shade mechanic crooks. Their smart arse service department manager told me to take my truck to another dealer. Real nice way to stand behind your product! Run, run, run, from these people, There is ZERO service after the sell. I'm filing a lemon law complaint with the State of Texas. I should not have to drive a truck with brakes that are broken and do not function correctly. I've never sen such pure neglect in incompetency coupled with very very poor attitudes. I bought a very expensive lifetime warranty and I can 't even get the most simplest of things repaired. ",1.0
4,"April 16, 2018","Service Dept is a disappointment, once the sale of the vehicle is completed they cannot provide customer service in the service Dept. Service writers are rude and gave me the impression they do not care. Pull in the service drive and nobody comes out to wait on you, go in the service office and your presence is ignored, they give me the impression the customer bothers them! I donâ€™t like this reception so, I will go to another dealership for service and sales. ",1.0
5,"January 19, 2018","I needed a another van.  Rodney found what I wanted right away.  We discussed other available vehicles, but he didn't burden me with a lot of the ""you ought to think about upgrading"" hype.  He met my needs - fast.  The expertise within the Service Department staff has never disappointed me.  If you want a massage or something besides popcorn find a high priced outfit with lots of overhead; need a decent vehicle at an affordable price and a friendly staff to maintain it, come here.  ",5.0
6,"November 11, 2017","I had a concern with my invoice and a specific charge that was what I perceived as part of my agreement with the dealership. Jose Soria, the internet sales manager reviewed and addressed  my concern with professionalism and kindness and refunded the difference of my dispute. He gained a dedicated customer.",5.0
7,"August 10, 2017","I made an appointment for warranty service at this location.  I arrived at the agreed time (0730) and was told that I would receive a call once they diagnosed the issue.  After not receiving a call by 2:30 pm in the afternoon I called only to be told that my vehicle has NOT been even looked at due to their busy schedule.  I am being told by my service adviser that making an appointment DOES NOT constitute that my vehicle will be repaired, it just puts me in line!  Someone needs to explain this to me!  If this is the Dodge Ram service that is expected, I would've purchased a Ford!  How does one make an appointment to be put in line...???  Luckily this isn't a restaurant where you make a reservation and left to sit there for a few days waiting to eat!",1.5
8,"August 05, 2017","I had my best new car buying experience with Bluebonnet.   After months of searching,  Bluebonnet offers the lowest internet pricing,  and largest inventory in the state of Texas.   I had researched the market in north Texas,  Austin,  and San Antonio.   It is definitely worth my four hours of driving to pick up my dream car. 

My sales,  Jeorge Ramirez, was very friendly and cursterious. When I arrived, he had already pulled out my top two choices for test drives, and further taking me to their offsite storage lot to see their 50+ Pacificas.  Once I selected my final choice,  there is not much negotiation needed because they had the lowest price.  I would definitely recommend new car buyers to contact Mr. Jeorge Ramirez for the most enjoying and rewarding car buying experience. 

The finance department was another great help.   Mr. Thomas Alan was friendly to prepared my paperwork.   And, of course,  he tried very professionally to sell me the extended warranty,  and gap insurance.  After I rejected both offers,  Mr.  Alan continuous with his patienting effort to sell me the synthetic oil change and tire rotation service.   I finally touched by his professionalism in sales,  and agreed to his third sales offer.  BUT,  thirty hours after I happily drove my car to 
my vacation site,  buyers remorse kicked in as I found out that Chrysler website offered the same deal that costed 50% less than Mr. Alan's offer.   So,  my other advise to car buyers is that do NOT agree to buy anything other than the vehicle in the finance office.  

Just think about that you have spent months on car researching,  and hours with your best sales to pick out your dream car,  did you give yourself the same amount of time in researching the sales item from the finance office that is not related to signing the contract on the vehicle. 

My five star rating is mainly based on Jeorge,  because I knew that finance office in any dealership will not easily let you walk out without buying something.  In my case,  I am surprised at the deep markup of 50% more than Chrysler website.  I can only blame myself for not doing enough research on the unanticipated sales item from the friendly finance office. 

At the end,  I do truely recommend this dealership,  because it just got the best pricing and service....",5.0
9,"July 27, 2017","First I agreed and bought a new pickup. about and hour later the salesman called and said that he had errored and the truck would be $4,500 more. But due to the error they would reduce that by $1,000. That brought the truck down to 24,500 trade. I did not respond so the next morning I get a call where they reduced the price another $1,000 so now we are at $23,500 trade. I ask, would you trust this outfit or move on. I then get a email from a Baswell that says they have lowered their prices more to give them a call. I picked 4 different pickups out that would work for me with one being the top one. I finally got a call back from the salesman and he came up with a cost of $24,500 TRADE. this pickup is of lessor value and now they want more. The other thing I do go along with is the fact that they add things on and charge you for them when you don't want them. The high light is when they charge you $499 for a spray in box protector and it is already on the window sticker for that price. I caught them doing this twice.",1.8

11,"June 29, 2017","Two days ago, I walked into Blubonnet after speaking with Jacob P. I wanted to see a 2017 Ram Sport. Well to make a long story short, I drove home with one a couple of hours later. Jeorge R. was great!!! He answered all of my questions. Great service in finance! Matt helped to get me the best rate available... The team responding quickly with the vehicle I wanted... These folks are amazing! This was by far the easiest vehicle purchase process I have ever experienced. I highly recommend buying from Bluebonnet!",5.0

14,"February 13, 2017","I met Jeff Wegnan Friday afternoon, Feb 10th, 2017 when searching for a new Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Rubicon Hard Rock edition. He had just what my wife and I were looking for--I looked it over for a bit and we went inside.to talk.  Pricing was very straight-forward and my questions were answered on the spot.  He and others took a look at my trade-in to arrive at an extremely fair value for both sides.  Saturday morning, my wife and I went back ... she took one look at the Jeep and fell instantly in love with it.  We went almost immediately into the paperwork/financing phase of the adventure and in a very short time we were the proud new owners of the Jeep.  This is the best car purchase process in our lives (age 60+) and I can only heap praise on Jeff and his professionalism and the staff at Bluebonnet. ",5.0
15,"December 17, 2016","I contacted this dealership because I was wanting to trade-in my current truck for a 2500 Laramie.  They are a little bit of a drive for me so I asked them via email for an estimated trade-in amount on my truck.  Of course they tell me I have to come into the dealership so they can appraise it.  This is sales tactic #1, get them into the door.

So I drive out there and take a quick look at one of the rams.  We have to cross a busy street to do this as a lot of their inventory is located in a different area.  So we run across the street, my wife carrying my new born.  Look at one of the trucks.  Yes I like it, I have already done research prior and have already been to other dealerships.  

So we run back across the street were I'm now trying to get them to just give me a trade-in amount on my truck.  The salesman (Clint Laubacj) comes back and says his manager says they can't give me a trade-in amount unless I test ride one of the trucks first.  Sales tactic #2, get them into a new vehicle.

Now the truck I'm wanting options wise, is a couple miles down the road in yet another lot they own.  So I ride over there with Clint and test ride the new Ram.  We get back to the dealership and they are still not giving me a trade-in amount.  They write up the numbers to purchase the new truck and want me to initial it.  I'm not going to agree to buy your truck unless you give me an amount on my trade-in FIRST!  Sales tactic #3, keep the numbers vague and just try to make a deal. 

So I leave and message them the next day.  I told them how much a competing dealership is offering me for my truck.  I asked them if they will match it.  But I do get a response the next day.  Now its sales tactic #4.  They look into some kind of system and find out how much I paid for my truck.  My truck was a left over model year, and was purchased with a trade-in that the previous dealer really wanted and made a lot of money off of.  Because of that I had got a good deal on my current truck.  But because of that reason, this dealership now knows how much I have in it.  And because of that comes back with a low ball offer.  

These type of dealerships are the ones you want to look out for.  Do your research.  Read the reviews.  Don't let them screw you over.  And walk away when they start playing their typical sales tactics.  Read my warning and go elsewhere.  There are so many dealerships available and online tools at your disposal.  Don't let this dealership take advantage of you. ",1.2
16,"October 10, 2016","I wish I could say that the service department was great and took pride in their work, but unfortunately that's not the case. I took my 2016 town and country in for a recall and a warranty repair.  At the time the service advisor made it seem that everything was going to be great. They had the vehicle for almost 2 weeks.  When I got the vehicle back, it was in worse condition than when I turned it in. They left grease marks all over the back of the DVD screens and on the the leather passenger seat. I guess they wanted me to know they were in the vehicle. Also they did secure the plastic under the front bumper. The driver side was hanging off because they put the clip on the plastic but failed to clip it in the bumper prior to clipping it in the plastic. Also they put a big chip in the paint in the rear bumper. One last thing when I got it back, the remote start system does not work right. It dies every time I put my foot on the brake and push the start button. It makes me wonder what else is wrong with the vehicle since they can't even take care of the little things like wiping off the grease. If you want your vehicle back in worse condition than when you dropped it off, take it here. Another negative is I had to call three days in a row just to talk to the advisor because he would not return my calls. Now I have to go back in to get it fixed and it's a 45 min drive. It's a big inconvenience because the dealership couldn't get it right the first time. Thanks Bluebonnet.",1.0
17,"September 08, 2016","Starting with salesman, he was exceptional, took the time to return my calls, explained everything on the vehicle, worked with our schedule. Then, the Finance Manager, there is no words to explain my gratitude towards this young man, he went far and beyond to get a better deal, he is very professional, very friendly, and spectacular finance expert.  I will definetely recommend BlueBonnet, I drove from McAllen and chose BlueBonnet because of their professionalism and customer service, something my local dealer does not have.",5.0
18,"August 05, 2016","First off, I would like to say STAY AWAY FROM BLUEBONNET CHRYSLER DODGE.

Tom Allen was a great salesman, assuming that he did not know about all of the problems with the truck when he sold it to me.  The rest of the staff I have talked to at Bluebonnet have not done anything for me, except put around 100 extra miles on my truck, wasted time, and gas with nothing improving on my truck.  

I purchased the truck in early May.  I have taken the Dodge Ram up to Bluebonnet Chrysler Dodge three times so far in a span of one month.  I took the truck to a repair shop, and they told me that the rotors were warped and that's why my brakes sounded horrible.  The first time I took it up there, the used car manager said the problem would be fixed and gave me a loaner vehicle.  The next morning, I received a call from the used car manager that the loaner vehicle had been purchased, and asked me if I would drive the vehicle up to the dealership to get a new loaner, or they could have someone drive down to me.  I offered to drive the loaner up to BB Dodge because I was happy with the dealership for taking care of my truck's problems.  In return, the used car manager told me that I would get a year's worth of car washes to The Wash Tub.  After returning the loaner, and getting a different loaner, I was on my way back to San Antonio.  The used car manager never gave me the car wash voucher, but that was fine, as I really just wanted to fix my truck.

I got a call eight days later from the service department, and they stated that there was nothing wrong with the truck (I guess my brakes were just randomly squeaking for no reason?).  After this, I drove back up to the dealership, traded out the loaner, and got back in my 2008 Dodge Ram.  Before I even made it back to San Antonio, I noticed the brakes were squeaking.  I took it into two other repair shops in San Antonio.  Both repair shops, once again, stated that the back rotors needed to at least be resurfaced, and possibly be replaced.  So I took the truck back up to New Braunfels on the 29th of June, and the used car manager was not there.  I talked with the service department, and they could not even locate my name on the system.  They had the name as Nicholas Barista in the system as owning the truck.  This made there be a long delay in even being able to talk with the service department, because it showed that I wasn't even the owner of the vehicle.  I talked with someone else at Bluebonnet since the used car manager was not there.  We agreed I would bring the vehicle back when the used car manager got back.

When I was back home in Indiana for the 4th of July, I was in contact with Veronica Diaz about my title, because I tried to register the truck in Indiana.  I never received a title, because Veronica said my finance manager was supposed to follow up with me and see where I wanted to register my vehicle, in Indiana or Texas.  So my title was sitting with Veronica for two months because I never had a follow up that was supposed to happen, and that has made it so I just received my license plate and registration now, two and a half months after the purchase of the truck.

Finally, on Saturday June 9th, I took my truck back to the dealership for the third time.  I met with the used car manager, and he talked with the service department.  Instead of giving me a loaner and actually making an effort to look at the truck, the service department stated that there couldn't be anything wrong with the rotors.  They just did a quick fix on it, as the service manager believed it was just dust in the brakes causing the squeaking.  So they ""fixed"" the truck, and on the drive back once again, the brakes sounded worse than they ever have.  They still sound like that today.  

I bought a vehicle from an actual certified dealership instead of a used car dealership so that if I had a problem, I thought it would be taken care of.  Bluebonnet dodge, even if it was a random occurrence, made no effort with the customer in this case.

I have emailed the general manager of the whole dealership, and never heard a word back.  Gave him the whole outline of what happened, and he never tried to alleviate the situation.  Worst place I have ever dealt with in my life.

20,"March 18, 2016","Went to buy a car on Feb. 17, 2016.  Spoke with a Jose Soria.  That car I wanted was sold 15 mins. before I got there. A Nissan Versa Note  After arriving, I spoke with Jose and told him I did not want to buy rental.  He SOLD me not only a rental but a pre-cert. ford fiesta, vin. 3FADP4EJ2DM215779, 2013 model.  I thought being a female that something's had changed about our treatment in places like this.  I found out, it was no different.

I bought the car since I had a standard for 17 years and my body just couldn't handle the shifting anymore.  I informed Jose that I was using my car and $700.00 IN CASH as down payment on my car and that I forgot my title and would bring that on Saturday.

Long story short, went into finance to start paperwork and the cash was in a bank envelope and placed it on the guys desk.  Paid another $92.00 and some change to bring it down to $9,500.00 even.  On the way home I noticed there was a problem with the engine as if the car wanted to die.  Went back the following Wed. 2-24-16 for Jose to check it out.  I had received a call from Jose about the $700.00 in cash. Informed him of what I did and the guy picked up all the paperwork and put it in an envelope.

When we met with the main manger, the finance guy and Jose Soria, the finance guy said that I was going to bring the money in that Sat. with the title.  Why would I take $700.00 IN CASH HOME, to bring it back?????  REALLY?  So, buy the head manger, I was told to go home a look in nocks and cranes or between the wall and bed to see if that's were it fell.  I told him how could it have fallen at home, when I sat out in the parking lot counting the money.  In the mean time, the finance guy didn't talk---HE started --BY YELLING---""YOUR A LIAR!!!!""  Very professional dude.  Sad thing is, there were FIVE guys standing outside the door listening to all this and the sad thing----- an OLDER LADY who was a CUSTOMER standing there hearing all this.  What a SHAME.  

No many ever found, took me over a week and a half to get my car back, Jose Soria said they sold it, I told him it was against the law to sell a car without the title he said they could.  I still have my contract that states I paid the $700.00, the trade in and the $92.00 and change that both ME and the FIANCE GUY SIGNED.

To this date, I still don't have the $700.00 that was missed placed, they wanted me to give them another $700.00 or have it placed on my payment and during this WHOLE time, where is my CAR.  AS stated, I finally got that back, still waiting for the $700.00.  I will be seeking legal counsel in this matter to try and get the $700.00 in cash back that was misplaced.  Good NEWS:  I forgot to place a stamp on the envelope, so I THANK God, I got the title back.  So bye- bye to part of that money that was my income tax check.  

Now I own a NISSIAN 2016, a Nissan as I wanted at first, couldn't put the $700.00 cash down like I would have like to since they STILL haven't found it, BUT  NISSIANS RULE.  As for the 2013 PRE.-CERT ford fiesta good and ready to go???  Yeah, it stood up to the FORD name.  I was almost a FOUND ON ROAD DEAD when it almost staled on me going home from work in Austin.",1.0
21,"January 02, 2016","I drove 4 hours from Dallas to check out a Challenger on the BBDodge lot, and ended up buying it.  Tom Allen was my salesman, and he was great!  No pressure, just a great experience.  Jacob Campbell was the Finance Manager who helped me negotiate a lower interest rate on my loan, and was very patient with all my questions.  I left the dealership happy with the deal and the car.  Great job guys, thank you.

23,"December 09, 2015","I drove 14 hours to San Antonio for a different truck that was grossly misrepresented. On my way home feeling completely disappointed we found a couple trucks on bb's website. When I arrived at the dealership ""Big Al"" took me to the vehicles and was incredible! The next morning I drove home in our 2013 F350. The service at their used lot is excellent and I will drive the 14 hours to work with them again!",5.0
24,"October 22, 2015","Well to start off, the initial sale was moderate to say the least. The sales rep knew little to nothing about the car itself (despite claiming his daughter owned one) and when I would point things out (small crack in the windshield, sunroof didn't close properly but it opened fine, didn't know how to shift out of manu-matic) he would just chuckle and shrug them off. I should have said no deal right there. Despite my gut I went ahead with the sale and during said sale I presented my financing to which they replied let me see if I can do better, another thing I should have said don't waste your time with. The next few weeks i got letters from 6 different credit agencies stating they had inquired my credit to see about financing. THANKS FOR THAT GUYS! 

After I got the car home I was happy.  On the 4th day after the sale I went out to my car to go to a lunch meeting I had. Lo and behold my car would not start. This was on sunday. I called them FIRST THING 8am monday morning and the secretary said ""oh everyone is in a meeting I'll have them call you back"" So I gave her my number and expected a call within the hour. 9:30 rolls around I give em another call. Everyone was no longer in a meeting and now they just decided to not call me back. So I talked to greg and told him the issue to which he replied let me talk to the sales manager. 11am I havent heard anything back so I called them and long story short he kept asking ""did I buy any extended warranty on it"" There is no way in hell anyone should need a warranty to cover something 4 days after the sales date. I don't care what you call it that is 100% bad business. Just asking is downright insulting. So after kindly telling greg that he was going to have the car towed and fixed and with much ""hand holding"" (calling and checking up and basically having to do his job for him) the car was picked up (tuesday) and off to the shop. At this point its out of my hands all i can do is wait for an update. which came the next day. ""Good news we got your car running again!"" to which my response was ""What was wrong with it."" Gregs response was ""Well we opened it up and nothing looked wrong so we just closed it back up and tried starting it a little later and it just started up. It seemed to be because the wheels were turned.""  I was baffeled but just wanted to get my car back and not have to deal with these guys again.

fast forward 8 weeks.

1400: left for work as usual, got to work and parked in one of the usual spots with wheels straight. 
1830 I went downstairs to go to dinner, at which point I put the key in the ignition and the car wont start. Same symptoms as last time. everything works but the windows and the car wont start. being that it was late in the day i did not think they would be open so I had to wait till monday, which meant not only did i have to find a ride home I also was stranded all day sunday. Monday morning I called and talked to greg and let him know this was happening again. he again brought up the warranty thing to which i replied ""I didn't think i was going to need a warranty within the first 90 days of having the car, that seems very unresonable"" I understand at a certain point what happens to the vehicle is my responsibility but being that this is the exact same issue and they didnt fix anything last time they should be more willing to help. needless to say I continued my hand holding that I had to do last time. called during my dinner break at around 1800 again with no response.
9/17/2013:Called all morning for Greg on his cell and through the office. Finally at around Noon I got a hold of him and he had the gall to tell me ""I didn't call you back because I didn't have any news"" At which point i filed a BBBcomplaint and left multiple voicemails on the Manager's voicemail, Brett Westbrook.

25,"October 09, 2015","Just want to give a shout out and big thanks to those that helped me at bluebonnet dodge.
I knew what I was looking for ""a scat pack challenger with shaker package.  I saw one on line at your dealership 3 hours away but no one here even had one on order.  I connected with Tom Allen in sales and he took me step by step through the process staying in touch along the way.  He was very helpful and no pressure.  I would recommend Tom and Bluebonnet dodge to anyone looking to purchase a new vehicle.  It cant go without saying Michelle Voss in finance is the one that made it all happen and closed the deal she worked hard to get me a great interest rate and a payment I was happy with (finance is the hardest part in buying a new car for me many just don't seem to care) With Michelle she worked hard for ME and just gave me a good feeling about the whole experience.
I drove down on a Saturday all papers were ready to sign and was out in 30 minutes driving my awesome new car home!
Thanks guys

I live in Mont Belvieu near Baytown. I called on Wednesday September 22 and spoke to Gregg Lutman about the Ram Outdoorsman. I could not believe the price of this loaded-out truck, $37,499. After finding out everything on this truck I asked him what's next. I was able to do everything online. They held the truck for 3 days with no money down! No other dealer has offered this. Once i arrived at the dealership they had the truck ready; washed, tagged out, tank full of gas.I test drove it and signed paperwork...out in 3 hrs. Best experience ever. Great job Bluebonnet!",5.0

28,"May 11, 2015","I recently purchased a pre-owned  2012 Subaru Impreza from Jacob Plont back in Feb 2015. The process was easy I got the car I wanted and Jacob got the sale a win win. While there is always the chance I might have paid a little more than I really wanted to, I had looked several places for this model. Needless to say there were none within the traveling distance I wanted to go to, or to waste time from my schedule to shop. In the end I paid what I felt was comfortable for me. Price is not always the deciding factor convenience is worth paying for.
There were a few things that the car needed before I was ready to take it in particular an open recall plus I had also ordered window tint also thanks for the full tank of gas. One of the other issues was that the rear tire TPS Tire Pressure sensor was not the correct type for the Subaru brand.  Jacob had set up an open appointment with their sister dealership Subaru of San Antonio at the Dominion. The day they took it to Subaru for the recall they did not have the part to repair the sensor so I took delivery with a promise to get a repair at a future date.  While I would have liked the dealership to have taken care of the repair 3 months ago, they were true to their promise and finally today, I am here getting it fixed. The one thing I can come away with was they ability of Jacob to follow through, responding to my nagging texts and been up front. 
On a final note I would hope that in the future while staging a car for a test drive the sales team could back the car into the spaces at the dealership. It can be awkward backing out into traffic, especially in a vehicle your not quite used to.

30,"December 18, 2014","I had a passing interest in looking for a newer vehicle.  I happened to be in the area of the Bluebonnet dealership and had seen on-line the type of car I was looking for.  Since I was there I stopped by not really expecting much since I wasn't really serious in buying that afternoon.

I met with Jeff Wegman and told him what I was looking for.  He checked his list and surprise surprise they had almost the exact car I was looking for in my price range.  Funny thing though, the car wasn't officially listed yet.  It was still in ""make-ready"".  Jeff wasted no time in tracking the keys and the car down so that I could take a look.

The car was in great shape.  Not only was I able to look at the car I was able to take a test drive the same car before ""make-ready"" had gotten to do their job.

Long story short, it was the car for me.  That's where Jeff went to bat for me yet again.  I was dead set on my price.  I had no wiggle room.  He was able to get his manager and finance to reduce the price by $500 so that I was within my budget and make the sale.

All in all... very professional, super friendly, and didn't hide or purposely try to make the process confusing.  The whole team was very straight forward and transparent with every process.  Why they needed this information and what the next step was going to be.  If I had any questions they were right there to talk me through it and explain it until I understood whatever it was.

Blue Bonnet has a well deserved great reputation in our area and they more than lived up to it me.

I highly recommend this dealership.  Whether its for a used car like me or a new car.  Go to Blue Bonnet and let the team take good care of you.  You won't regret it in the least.  You will have a hassle and stress free experience and get a great deal in the same process.",5.0

41,"June 15, 2014","I understand that, with the advent of the internet, used truck sales can be sold instantly (either on Ebay, or a buyer can ""beat me to it"", which was the case with the original truck I was going to buy).   It turned out that I was disappointed when my first truck selection was ""sold"" prior to me being able to get to New Braunfels, but this ended up being best for me.  You see.... Michael called me back to advise that the truck I wanted was sold already...but he (and Taylor) got together and let me know that they just gotten in another used truck that would exceed my needs for towing, and was right in my price-range.   That is the difference with Bluebonnet.  They take the time out to find out the needs of the customer, and then work hard to advise which vehicles meet (or in this case, exceed) your needs.   Other dealers might force the buyer into ""any old truck""....just to make a sale (or make more profit).   I felt like family in the entire process.  They were mindful of my time, and got me ""in and out"" in no time....even with Robert arranging the financing on a weekend!   What really set Bluebonnet apart was the fact that Michael called me back the next week, not only to ask if I was satisfied with the truck, but to let me know that he was able to quote me a great rate to get an additional keyfob/key to the truck cut and programmed.  There wouldn't be any ""follow up"" with most any other dealerships --- they would be on to the next sale.

They washed the vehicle and returned it after dark (it was covered in a thick layer of dirt). The next morning we noticed the many hail dents in the hood and the water on our carport slab. Thinking it might have been overfilled we didn't do anything. To make a long story short, within a week the water pump had to be replaced for about $550. The Excursion felt strange on the road so I had a mechanic check the alingment and had to spend $1,275 to rebuild the ball joints, tie rod ends and other pieces which made it obvious when the front axle was repaired, they had to put it back together very carefully since all of the parts were extremely worn out.

74,"December 26, 2011","Salesman: TAYLOR ADKINS


I have purchased 2 other Dodge Ram trucks from Bluebonnet and was very pleased with their service. This purchase though was quite unique!. I was priveleged to be helped by a salesman named TAYLOR ADKINS. Taylor did not posess the normal used car salesman personality that everyone hates, rather he treated me like a friend and guided me through the whole process. Second, I must say it was very nice to work with Taylor because he had the anwser to every question I had, from the vehicle information,pricing, and financing. Finally in buying a used vehicle you dont always get everything you need, (ie) floor mats. I was totally happy with my 2009 Dodge RAM, but it had no floor mats, Taylor worked something out and made sure i was taken care of. Finally, if the managers of Bluebonnet ever read this website, I sure hope you pay attention to Taylor's sales and customer attention because he should be a manager one day, and maybe train other saleman how to handle customers. I would also like to add that the service department helped me with a few issues and they sure have it down as well, being friendly, explaining your issues and wait time are superb at BB Dodge. Thanks so much, and you can rest assur I will return to Bluebonnet for our next vehicle.

I have never been less pressured, or more comfortable. Lenore made me feel as if I had known her my entire life. She was sincere, honest, and helped us get the exact truck that we wanted, at the best price that we had found. I trusted her judgement, and more importantly, her word. The gentleman in the finance department, who's name I can't remember, was also a tremendous help. We had been pre-approved by our bank, but he managed to get us a better rate through one of your lenders. Lenore got us a great deal, and the finance person,made it even a better deal.

Blue Bonnet took us right in and we walked out the next day with $938.72 less in our bank account but at least a car that ran, temporarily.  

Exactly one month and around 800 miles later the car started doing the exact same thing.  We called Blue Bonnet and again they took us right in.  They called later that day to tell us they were going to have to replace the same part plus refurbish the entire transmission.  This time it would cost us $2,200.  They were not willing to give us any credit, except for the warrantied part, for the money we had already spent even though their fix this time included the exact same thing they had just done.  Based on their assessment we don't really feel they took the time to look at the car and diagnose the true problem either time.

The only issue I had/have is with the Finance Director, Steve Konecko, nice guy, did his job to the max, however, when he was explaining what we ""GOT"", it is my opinion, he lead us to belive the life insurance, and one part of the warranty packages were included because we were financing the vehicle through a company that gave us an additional rebate. In fact I thought how strange there was no charge. Have no issue with both coverages, in fact very happy with them gald we have them. However, I think a better disclosure noting the cost of these options and we the choice to not take them or not, or pay cash for them instead of financing them for 72 months.  The cost of life insurance,($315.76),extended warranty, ($1340.00).  If I misunderstood then I offer my apolgy, however, I don't think that was the case.

We negotiated a price to have an upgraded radio with Navigation system installed the next week.  Got the car home and noticed the window etching and undercoating we paid for wasnâ€™t completed.  I called to schedule both jobs the following week.  Brought the car in the next week for the install and the system was installed with all portions completed according to the service department.  Later in the week my wife noticed the remote IPOD arm rest feature no longer worked.  Called, discussed with service and agreed for an appointment the next week to fix.  Dropped the car off on a Wednesday night and didnâ€™t get it until the next week with absolutely no changes made to the radio configuration.  Throughout the week there were numerous stories about faulty components and parts shipping delays.  NONE of the managers could offer any kind of solutions or compensations for the week without the car or repeat trips to try and find a fault that wasnâ€™t fixable.  No rental was offered or decisions made to facilitate the process.  
The most disturbing thing about the whole experience was the lack of customer service from the managers.  I understand not all service problems can be solved or foreseen, however the Blue Bonnet managers did nothing to help the situation.  The attitude was sorry we are troubleshooting and there is nothing else we can do.  Nothing was changed after two trips to the dealer, multiple stories of faulty equipment, and more than a week without a brand new car.

IT IS A 2007 AND I HAVE 293,000 MILES WITH VERY LITTLE WORK DONE ON IT.  THE SALES MAN WAS OUTSTANDING AND  KNOWS ALL THERE IS TO KNOW ABOUT IT OR ELSE HE WILL FIND OUT AND TELL YOU.  WHEN I TAKE IT IN FOR SERVICE I GO TO KOBIE AND HE ALSO IS THE BEST.  HE TELLS YOU WHAT SERVICE YOU NEED AND WHAT SHOULD BE DONE THE NEXT TIME YOU COME IN.  WHEN IT GET BACK TO THE SERVICE BAY YOU WILL BE IN THE HAND ON TOMMIE WHO IS THE BEST DIESEL MEC THAT I HAVE DELT WITH.  HE WILL TELL YOU THE ANSWER TO ANY QUESTION THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE ABOUT YOUR TRUCK, HE WILL GIVE YOU ADVICE ABOUT HOW TO DRIVE AND MAINTAIN IT.   I FORGOT TO TELL YOU ABOUT STEVE WHO IS THE MAN YOU WILL SEE WHEN YOU ARE CLOSING THE DEAL.  HE IS VERY GOOD AT HIS JOB AND WILL GET YOU THE BEST FINANCE THAT CAN BE HAD.   MY DEALING WITH BLUEBONNET HAS BEEN  VERY GOOD  AND I WOULD RECOMMEND THEM TO ANY ONE THAT IS GOING TO BUY A NEW TRUCK OR A NEW CAR.

This dealership is ranked high for a reason.

125,"July 27, 2010","Setting the scene: I went shopping for a Dodge Challenger a few days after I was released from Neurological ICU care due to brain surgery. With forty staples still in my head, I sought to purchase a car for my daughter's sixteenth Birthday. In San Antonio prime, I went to most Dodge dealers and was treated with typical, game playing car salesmanship; needless to say I had no patience for these dealers. I drove approximately thirty miles to Blue Bonnet and was positively pleased with the professionalism of David and the finance department/manager at the dealership. So, I purchased a new Challenger from David that he designed with her (and my) favorite colors, non standard stripes and removed the flashy chrome to create an eye catching modern classic. Not only did he care about selling the car, but he took time from his personal hours and followed up each week for three weeks to make sure that I was healing and feeling well. His and his dealershipâ€™s behavior towards me was/is frankly, Professional. He will receive return business from me and mine. Signed, D. Newton

126,"July 27, 2010",My family has been using Bluebonnet Chrysler Dodge for many years.  We have purchased many cars and trucks from them and have used the service department exclusively.  I would recommend this dealer for both sales and service to anyone.  Great people.,5.0
127,"July 08, 2010","New car buying is always somewhat traumatic for me, but the experience at Bluebonnet was actually pleasant. Bryan was waiting outside as I drove into the dealership, and his easy going and friendly demeanor immediately put me at ease. He had a thorough knowledge of the vehicles and gave detailed descriptions of features. Bryan and the other staff ensured that the purchase process was swift and fair.  Because I used the dealership website, I was able to receive a reasonable price quote before I arrived and avoid the negotiation drama. Also, I obtained some valuable extras online that I was very happy about. Having done some research ahead of time, I concluded that Bluebonnet offered the best value and customer service and I am glad to say that my experience proved this to be true. ",5.0
128,"June 02, 2010","In our eyes, Robert did an awesome job. Even though the dealership had closed for the night, he stayed there after we purchased our car and showed us what everything did. We went back the next day to sign a couple more papers, and he was interested in seeing what our 9 years old sons thoughts were on the car. Thanks Robert.

129,"May 24, 2010","I rated customer service, Friendliness, and overall experience as great because I was very satisfied with my shopping experience. I rated price as good because I feel there was more bargaining room on their side but I wasnt a good enough negotiator to achieve the lowest price, however it was still a reasonable and acceptable price to me.  I left quality of work unrated because I didnt have any work done, i purchased a new vehicle.",4.8
130,"May 20, 2010","We started out on May 15, 2010 to look at CarMax for a used Chrysler stowngo minivan - having a 2005 same to trade in.  The 2005 was purchased at CarMax.  We looked at CarMax and had one in mind - price was not bad and their trade-in offer was good.  We had bought CarMax numerous times before and liked the straight-forward approach and not the all-day haggling with the ""big bad dog"" in the back office to whom a salesman at a regular car dealership always said he had to take our offer.  Always seemed like if we went the dealership route, we should plan on packing lunch, dinner and a change of clothes to even get a clean cash deal closed.

We decided to check at a dealer on the best deal on a new van.  Turned out buying at Bluebonnet.  Alvin Bailey steered us through the process in an extremely competent manner.  Trade in value was a tad better than CarMax and we figure we're getting a deal that will prove to be 20% less per total expected mileage than the CarMax deal.  
Steve in the Business Office was extremly efficient and pleasant - he knew the warranty options well.  Hopefully all the future service experience will be as great.

Fastsest we've ever bought a car at a dealership - which is important for us.  Didn't need to bring dinner and a change of clothes - but lunch sandwiches would have been great!  Thanks for renewing our options for car buying.  We'll consider a dealership next time as our first stop.",5.0
131,"May 15, 2010","My son and I went to Bluebonnet today to look for a truck for him. He was trading in a 2007 Toyota but wanted something more manly. My husband and I had been to this dealership a year ago and it was a very pleasant experience which is why we wanted to check there first. Our salesman, Scott, was so professional and you had no doubt that he was working for you. He knew his business and was very personable. We got a great deal (better than we expected) and left with smiles on our faces. I highly recommend this dealership if you are in the market for a car or truck.",5.0
132,"April 30, 2010",I am always so happy when i visit Bluebonnet Chrystler Dodge. The employees are so friendly and helpful. I have bought 2 cars from my sales person Lisa Rudd over the years. She is the best! We have developed a long friendship. I can call her about any questions or concerns about my car. I am even considering buying a new car and am currently working with Lisa Rudd. She always gets me a great price and lets me know upfront if a deal wont work for me. I also love working with the GM Steve LaSerrera. Lisa and Steve make a great team and never make you feel like you are asking for too much or wasting their time. Thank you Bluebonnet Chrystler Dodge for years of great customer service....and a big special thank you to Lisa Rudd and Steve LaSerrera. ,5.0
133,"April 29, 2010","My salesperson, Lisa Rudd, came highly recommended by a friend, and she made me feel comfortable right away.  I didn't know what I was looking for, have dismal credit, and was upside-down in my trade-in.  Not only did Lisa point me toward the vehicles with the best incentives, she and Stephan crunched the numbers so my monthly payment on the new car is less than it was for my trade-in.  I would confidently send friends and family members to this friendly, helpful salesperson.",4.5
134,"April 22, 2010","Well after purchasing a new truck 3 weeks ago, my husband and I went back to Bluebonnet Chrysler Dodge, and our salesperson Lisa, and purchased 2008 Chrysler Town & Country Touring Van.

We have never had a more enjoyable time buying a new vehicle. ",5.0
136,"April 18, 2010","I want to say that I shopped around San Antonio and the surrounding areas and I found what I was looking for with Robert Mendez!  If you have a high-standard of service then he is the representative for you! I like the small town and straight up approach BlueBonnet has! I wouldn't recommend anywhere else!

137,"April 17, 2010","My wife and I shopped other Dodge dealers in San Antonio , San Marcos and Seguin but none of them came close to the service, price, friendliness, or knowledge of Robert E. Mendez at Bluebonnet Motors. We also shopped Nissan, Ford, Chevy, Toyota, and Honda. None of the competitors could offer us a vehicle that had all the extras, size and fuel economy that we found in our Charger at an incredible low price.",5.0
138,"April 13, 2010","I had the pleasure or working with Cody Collier & Robert Mendez.  Bothe did their best to work with me and their follow up was wondeful.  I left with the new vehicle and they owed me a spray in bed liner & side steps.  Cody followed up with me, got me my appointmentsn and got me squared away.  Robert Mendez sat with me for like 40 minutes while I waited for the side steps to be mounted. Over all great experince probably why they are # 1 in Texas.",4.8
139,"April 10, 2010",I had been shopping for a truck to fit my towing needs. I thought I needed a truck bigger than a 1 ton. I was getting very frustated with salespoeple at a couple of other dealers that didn't know anything about their trucks capabilities. I am so fortunate to have found Alvin at Bluebonnet Dodge. He was able to ask the right questions and recommend the right truck. I am completely satisfied with my purchase and I can honestly say that I learned everything I needed to know about my new Dodge to make it work for me. GREAT JOB!!!!,5.0
140,"April 08, 2010","Worked with Todd on buying a new 09 1500. Purchased one in Nov of 08, then traded it in on another 09 in April of 09.  Decided I wanted a 1500 w/rambox.  I believe Todd & the dealership did the very best they could to help me not loose too much money on my 6 month old trade in. Blue Book and NADA didn't even have values yet for the 09's. The people there are very friendly.  I also have a had a great experience with the parts guy James Atchison, who helped me look up the parts for a new rear bumper to replace the one my son damaged. I also purchased some accessories and James was really helpful with finding what I wanted.  The guys in the office where the special orders are placed are also great to work with. They listen to you and help you put together an order you will be happy with for a long time.  I love my truck and a lot of that is because of the experience of working with the Bluebonnet team, as well as being welcomed back whenever I'm there just to look or get parts or ask questions.  We will be purchasing a charger for my wife soon and it will be from Bluebonnet.",4.8
141,"March 26, 2010",Great sales department. Extremely satisfied with the purchase and delivery of my Ram 1500.
