2,"February 24, 2020","Had a great buying experience . Bert Ogden had the best prices within a 500 mi radius of Corpus Christi (did my shopping online) . Dealership also gave me the most for my trade in . Staff was very supportive when called upon: Mrs Cerda , Jorge and Jessie Goris. Salesperson Vanessa Ochoa did a great job, she answered all my question and addressed all my concerns . She is truly an asset to your dealership . My only problem was with finance person Gabriel Alvarado . He gave me a lot of false information. I would double check everything he says or better yet deal with different finance person .I will definitely consider Bert Ogden when buying my next Infiniti",4.8

4,"May 30, 2012","I recently leased an Infiniti ex 35 after several flyers mailed to my address offering me a much lower payment I decided to contact the dealership trying to upgrade.  On the first attempt the salesman never got back to me and on the second attempt  when I asked if I should talk to another salesman he texted me back with some outrageous deal.  After contacting another dealership they assured me I was taken advantage of at Bert Ogden Infiniti. I cannot stand dishonest people,",2.0
