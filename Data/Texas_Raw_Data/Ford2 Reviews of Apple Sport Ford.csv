1,"August 03, 2008","I must be quite honest I drove over an hour to get to this dealer but I am sure glad I did. I just wish more dealers could be like them. I first called them and asked if they had a car(Ford Focus Wagon)to look at and they didn't pull the trick of saying they have to go check they honestly said yes and so I went ahead and drove up to see it. From there I thoroughly went through the car(I had already had a wagon previous and I knew what to look for) and they were just fine with it and allowed me to take my time and take tons of pictures for my parents and then I took it for a test drive and explained my situation on it and Guy the sales person was understanding. I got to have time to return home to email my pictures. My parents were able to get a good price based on what I had provided them and hold the car over the phone till they could drive down(they had a longer drive) to pickup the car. Plus it didn't stop there it took a whole 3 days to get the license plates.

This is honestly one of the best dealers I have been to. Guy was easily one of the friendliest car salesman I have seen too. I would say that due to the service we got they are worth every penny plus the drive. Based on what my parents have said is that they also really liked the dealer.",5.0
