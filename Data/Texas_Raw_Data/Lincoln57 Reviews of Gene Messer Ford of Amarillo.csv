1,"December 21, 2018","Have had an ongoing electrical/computer problem with 2012 F150 I bought from messer new. Entire electrical system shuts TOTALLY down!! Started 5-6 months back. Vehicle had to be drug out of garage 3 times as nothing works with out power. Was able to get it started once to get it to them. fourth time took it in 29 Oct 2018 & finally got disgusted with them, picked it up 21 Dec 18. Service mgr can only give LAME excuses like ""Quote"" We can't find out what the problem is. He's a paragon of lame statement's!!!! Never would agree to notifying the factory for guidance with this. Needless to say, I'll NEVER go back to messer for any reason!!!!!! Moving my vehicle's to another dealer. Think I was patient to a big degree but, after 4 times of the brush off, Fresh outta patience!  Neil Purcell. Not the advisors, ser mgr is the pits!!!!!!!!! Give a minus 5 stars!",1.0

38,"August 07, 2017",Gene Messer of Amarillo is helpful in purchasing servicing your vehicle.  When you are purchasing they explain everything to you and don't try to make you purchase they work with you to give you the best deal you are entitled too.  When your car needs to be serviced I wouldn't trust anyone else they take care if you and make you aware of what they are doing.  I would not go anywhere else to purchase or service a vehicle. I highly recommend Gene Messer of Anarillo,5.0

40,"August 01, 2017","We were experiencing engine problems with a F350 6.0L diesel. Showed up on Saturday early afternoon for oil and all filters. That didn't correct the problem; service writer got us setup for first thing Monday morning. Had experienced diesel tech and was completed and out the door the same day. Explained the problem early, and I made the decision to ""over fix"", as I am a pro preventive maintenance type person. Work has a good warranty at any Ford facility. Bad part, as with all dealers nationwide, I feel is the overpricing of both product and services. That's the only negative about the entire experience with this dealer. Great people, very nice facility, clean, accommodating. That's worth a bunch. ",5.0
41,"July 30, 2017","Clean, prompt and friendly. I plan to do my future business here. I've also used their parts department and the friendliness and helpfulness is worth coming back for.",5.0
42,"July 27, 2017",I have brought 2 Lincoln MKX s from the Amarillo location and have them serviced there as well. Usually the service is great but was disappointed this week when I had oil changed and tires rotation I waited 4 hours then had to ask only to find out my car had been ready for some time and my service person did know and hadn't checked on it. He had the keys on his counter. Better luck next time,4.0
43,"July 26, 2017","I took our car to have a key reprogrammed and I less than a hour it was done and I thought about it our other car was totaled over at the body shop and asked if they could switch the tires from one to the other and they went and got my car from the body shop and changed them out for me 
And P.S the donuts where great",5.0

48,"July 16, 2017","Rudy, the Service Manager, was fantastic. Our car was broke down and Ford Roadside Assistance still couldn't get a tow truck to get us for over 3 hours. So Rudy himself drove out to meet us immediately. He figured out the problem and got it so we could drive our car to the dealership and leave it to be fixed the next morning. He personally ensured it was fixed first thing and even met me at the door of the dealership when I came to get it. His service was impeccable. ",5.0

51,"July 11, 2017","Have bought from GMF and have brought all vehicles in for work that needed done. Will not buy from again nor have any work done here again. They mis-diagnosed an issue with my vehicle which was a $400 difference and when I called about this both the service mgn and the GM basically blew it off like it was impossible for them to have been wrong. Glad I got two more professional opinions before I wasted $$$.

53,"February 03, 2017","I know your not suppose to trust salesman in the first place but if you are looking at used cars there, be sure you have them print out the Carfax report so you can see it.  They held back some huge details about the car that should have been mentioned but never did.  Thank god we looked into it ourselves and got the Carfax ourselves and did not make the deal.  ",1.6
54,"January 13, 2016","I had a knocking sound from engine. It's still under warranty so I took it to Gene Messer. I asked for loaner car, they said they couldn't provide one until the 2nd week of working on it. I picked it up after they had it a week and it still has a knock. I spoke to technician he said he tightened some bolts on cam. He said he didn't think it was bad enough to cause further damage ,and he would try to find other car of same year and engine to listen to and compare sound. Sounds like they don't want to do warranty work because they don't make money on those repairs",1.8
55,"October 23, 2015",This is about the worst service department I've ever dealt with in my life. My car broke down on Monday Oct 5th while still under warranty. I had it towed to gene Messer because that is where I purchased it. That day the service advisor Chris Davenport called and told me that it would be a couple days before they knew anything. 2 days later he calls back and says it's the transmission I asked him about a loaner car so I could get back and forth to work.  He then said they (due to how strict ford warranty is)  wouldn't provide a loaner car till they start the actual work on my car and he would let me know as soon as he knew something else. I called again and again left voice-mail after voice-mail and could never talk to him. After over a week with no response from him I called ford warranty direct. They (ford warranty) told me to have the car moved out of gene Messer and over to tri state ford to get the work started faster because gene Messer is backed up 3 weeks. I was also told as soon as it gets to tri state ford they would provide a rental car. So I tried to do that. I sent a tow truck to go get it from gene Messer the tow company calls and said they couldn't get the car because it was in pieces. This is after I called and talked to JC in service and he said that would be fine for them to get it.  So a wasted road side assistance call to the tow company. So after 15 days with no car I get a call out of the blue to say my car is finished. I had somebody go pick it up for me due to the fact I was at work 50 miles away and no way to go get it. My friends bring my car to me and hand me the paperwork showing what work was done. On page 2 of the invoice it says the done a 99 point inspection and all is good except a oil filter leak. And even states the tread on the tires is OK at this time. Last time I had an oil change I was told and shown that the wear was bad on 2 tires all they had to do was look at them to see it. So I guess they BS the whole inspection but marked it as complete. I will never recommend Gene Messer Ford to anyone. And hope this helps someone make a decision on where to take there car for service.  ,1.0
