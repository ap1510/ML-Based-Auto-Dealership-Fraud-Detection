12,"March 12, 2020","I was truly amazed with the dealership.  Everything was clean and not cluttered.  The people were courteous and helpful.  Scott my sales rep, made me very comfortable with his laid back style, and friendliness.  He also knows his product, and sales it, while at the same time he is selling himself and the dealership.  As for the vehicle, it was exactly the vehicle I had been coveting for months.  The color is not the same boring colors that one sees constantly in dealerships.  It is alive and vibrant, and eye catching.  I also like that it was manufactured right here in Texas. I really think that the deal we made was acceptable, at least for now.  In a few months, maybe a year, I will go to my credit union and refinance for a lower rate. Thank you Community Toyota and Scott and Damien for helping me obtain a truly great vehicle; and since I have owned other Toyota's in the past, I look forward to enjoying this Tundra for several years.",5.0

Darren not only provides exceptional customer service along with an incredible knowledge of each vehicle we've looked at or purchased he is also a wonderful human being who we now consider a part of our family. We have brought other family members along with us in the past to Community Toyota to meet Darren Mooney and share the experience, and they too have found Darren to be a professional salesperson, who they will now purchase new vehicles from in the future.

I as not happy with the towing company who was recommended by your staff. He charged me $625 to go 5 miles from an apartment complex and all he had to do was hook and go. 
The car sat after the steering column was repaired for days after I received notice of pymt only for towing before it was sent to the collision department. 
When I called about the car, Robert was out for two days, no one could answer my question about the status and when I spoke with the collision department they said they would call back and did not. Robert called me at 9 am once he returned and located the electronic pymt and by 2 pm had the car transferred to the collision department, he notified me, discounted the bill and I made pymt of the remaining balance. 
Please do not recommend Batton Towing to future clients.  I really did not want that bill sent to my insurance company. Nor did I have the means to pay $625 for towing. I will have this investigated. 
Thank you for allowing me to air my opinion.

Because of circumstances, the car arrived while I was dealing with a lot of repairs to my home because of Harvey and because I volunteer and participate in high school activities with my son. When the car arrived at the dealership, I was told to come see it. I did. I was asked if I wanted to buy the car. I said, ""Yes, but give me a few days to check financimg options.""

This is when I experienced the high-pressure sales tactic.

""Sir, OK, check the rates but keep in mind I am getting a lot of pressure from my manager to sell this car.""

Really!??

Dude. I ordered the car. I came out to look at it. i said I wanted to buy it and now you have to play that card? 

It was not necessary. It was cheap. If I had waivered and said ""I don't know, I am not sure,"" then OK. Using the ""I have to sell this car,"" line is somewhat understandable.

I never waivered. Everything else in the experience was great. The ""hurry up and make up your mind"" message was rookie sales tactics. It tainted the sale and my relationship with the salesman and the dealership. ",4.2

239,"September 08, 2017","Beware when you take your car here.  I just had the worst experience at this location.  Every experience I've had at this location has been bad but today was the absolute worst!  Unfortunately I have a company car and they want me to take the car to Toyota and this is the only location around or I would not have come back after my first bad experience.
There was a chemical spill on I10 today.  When I called someone picked up the phone and then was talking to someone else and then a third  person finally said hello, Toyota service.   He actually provided me with customer service.  I called the service center because I had a 4:15 appointment for an oil change.  At 4:00 I was still stuck in traffic and called the service center to let them know I would be late for my appointment.  He said, oh your stuck on the freeway due to the chemical spill. 
 It's okay just let us know when you get here.  When I arrived I had just driven 30 miles and it took 2 hours in bumper to bumper traffic.  I thought my bladder was going to burst and I was hot and tired.  Robert provided me with terrible customer service.  He did not care about my situation.  I was obviously upset and stressed.  He did go out to talk to the service manager but it took him about 10 minutes to come back and tell me no they wouldn't help me.  
I have two recommendations on how this could have been handled better.  First when I called if they were not going to be able to accommodate me and I had to reschedule then would have been the time to tell me.  I would have just went back to work instead of spending two hours trying to get there.  The other recommendation is Robert obviously knew I was upset when he went to talk to the service manager Chris.  Chris should have come over to talk to me.  Robert did say I could come back tomorrow they would be open at 8:00.  I didn't spend two hours trying to get there to come back tomorrow.  I had plans for tomorrow and needed my oil to be changed.  This was not my first bad experience with this location but it surely is my last. I will have my oil changed tomorrow at 8:00 somewhere else.  ",1.0

Service also didn't return my call and I had to call back after 4 hours :( I know they were busy but Even a call to say they were working on it would have been good.
Once decisions were made, the repairs were done in a timely manner and for a fair price. The service rep was courteous and helped me with the overall cost. I could go elsewhere maybe cheaper but they make me feel as if they want my business and I appreciate that. I will continue to go there.",4.6

I called Community and, being my car is still under warranty, they gave me a phone number of a wrecker service.  I called that number and the wrecker driver was extremely nice and showed up within an hour!  That was nice!!  I called Community a few hours later and they didn't know what was wrong with it yet; however, I spoke to a guy named Robert Taylor and he was just as nice as they come and very understanding and he said he would make sure it was fixed promptly.  Twenty-four hours later, the car was fixed (bad battery cell.)  I was relieved it was just a battery because I bought a Toyota based on durability and their great reputation as very well-built automobiles.  I was dreading that it was something major and, luckily for me, it wasn't.  I had them perform an oil change while it was there and they also washed it as a courtesy.

These two gentlemen are stellar  individuals with only their customers true interests at heart. Purchasing a new vehicle can be a somewhat daunting task, especially for a woman, but these guys were willing to listen to my concerns and  give me honest answers. I look forward to working with these gentlemen again in the future.

I have done business with Community Toyota for over ten years. Never a negative experience. The first Toyota I had was serviced here for that five years. Then I moved to Hunble and had my car serviced once at a closer Toyota dealer After that one experience, I decided a round trip of 50+ miles was a small price to pay for service completed here at Community Toyota.

I had offered to place a deposit on the truck 3 different times. Was told didn't need to. Apparently there's no communication  between any staff. No one claimed to know 
anything of me coming to see the vehicle or to hold it. Complete waste of time, money and effort.  Only given excuses and I'm sorry.  Would not recommend this place.  Incompetence is rampant from Manger to Internet Sales and coordinaters.  Please avoid this dealer. They have offered nothing for this but to sell me an even more expensive vehicle at an over inflated price. Complete idiots that work there.

335,"February 01, 2016","The salesman awesome and had knowledge of the vehice prices without having to go back ang forth inside the dealership. I was less than impressed with the finance manager. After I clearly stated that I was not intrested in any warranty packages he inserted a nearly  $1000 package to cover the interior/exterior features of vehicle. Stating that the ""protector""chemical had already sprayed on the cars inside and outside. I believe when a vehicle is purchased ""as is"" it should not have hidden fees.I believe this falls under deceptive practices and should be made optional.I assume it will not since it is a clever way to earn additional revenue off the backs of consumers. Would have given 4-5 stars if not for this issue.",3.8

This is my story behind our the car purchase well what happen is that I had called and made an appointment with a salesperson  at Community Kia to purchase a vehicle, but upon my arrival a gentlemen met me and asked did I need any help and I said yes I have an appointment to discuss buying a new vehicle and so I gave him the salesperson name he left came back and asked me what kind of car was I looking for and I said Im looking for a Impala limited LTZ and he the responded we sell Kia  my first thought was yes I see the sign, but he proceeded to say they sold the vehicle that I was inquiring about, but the funny thing was the salesperson that I was suppose to meet with never came out to meet me and so I said ok thank you and walked out no one even tried to stop me or help me at all the customer service was very poor I figured that's probably why they didn't have any customers there, so I went sit in my car and made a phone call to Community Toyota which was down the street now mind you the weekend we had stopped here and looked and saw a 2014 Impala, so when I called a Mr. Maverick answered and I explained to him that I already had a auto loan and was looking for a car and that I just received poor customer service his response was Mrs. WILLIAMS come on in and let me see if I can help you..and to make a long story short Mr.Maverick gave me the best experience a customer could have he was very customer service oriented he understood what I wanted and that same day we were approved for our new vehicle..I always say customer service so Important Mr.Maverick was the best salesperson I've ever come across there was no stress he was very honest and upfront and that made all the difference, so if anyone is looking to purchase a  vehicle go see Mr. Maverick at COMMUNITY TOYOTA...Thanks Mr.Maverick see you soon to purchase my next vehicle.....

I was interested in either a new or used car and he was great in directing me in the right direction. He never once tried to up-sell me into something I could not afford.

355,"October 21, 2013","We have came to Community Toyota last Saturday with our mother in law to buy her a used car under $10,000 (she had cash). Both my husband and I bought two cars from Community Honda and our mother in law bought two cars from Community Toyota. If you count the amount of money that we have spent at this dealership it would be good over $100,000. We have always received a great customer service hence we have chosen the same place to bring our mother in law. Everything went great until my husband has noticed that the car that my mother in law wanted to purchase (toyota solara) was missing a fog light. I was not even worried about it because I knew our dealership would take care of a small detail as that. Unfortunatelly, it seemed like it was a deal breaker for this car because the Community Toyota refused to fix it. Community Toyota has not only lost my husband and I as customers but our mother in law and all the people that we would normally reffer to this dealership. Very dissapointed! Especially for the amount of money that we have spent at this place. Very dissapointed for my mother in law because she has purchased two brand new cars from them in the past. Hope to see a change and hope that in the future there should be any car that is being sold that is defected or refused by the dealership to be fixed before it is sold. I do understand ""As Is"" condition but I also understand that satisfied customer will bring 10 more customers for a good business. ",2.8
