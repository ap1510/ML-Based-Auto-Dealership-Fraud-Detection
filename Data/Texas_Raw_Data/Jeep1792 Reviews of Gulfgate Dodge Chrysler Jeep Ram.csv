118,"December 10, 2019","It's probably not recommended to show up at the dealer to buy a car with your kids in tow, but this is one area the Gulfgate team stood out to me.  The bouncy castle, the free food and treats, and the best part is the staff who were really understanding and patient with the kids.  Makes the lengthy process of buying a car a bit easier.  One of the staff had their little boy up there too, and my kids and him became quick friends.  He really stood out as a well raised child, he was courteous and polite and just a real joy.

When it came to negotiating the deal, I was very appreciative of how forthcoming they were with answers to my questions.  As with any deal, make sure you look it over and ask questions about every line, but the take-away here is Gulfgate didn't attempt to hide or lie about anything as I've experienced elsewhere.  

This is the second car I've bought at Gulfgate, and I won't hesitate to return for my third.  I visited 4 dealerships prior, should have just started at Gulfgate despite them being 40 miles from home.",5.0

156,"November 23, 2019","I had a quote from another dealership and I was told by Kenna (online rep) that Gulfgate would match the offer. I came in and told my salesman ( Jennifer) that. Instead of getting to the point, she wanted to play the sales game with me. She disappeared and kept me waiting.. She came back with an offer that was higher then the quote i brought in. I felt disrespected and I thought about walking out.  I should have walked out. After I refused her offer, she was quick to match the offer I brought in. Even though I came in with my own financing, she insisted on getting me to finance through the dealer. That included more waiting. She eventually sent me off to financing when I met a pleasant lady. Within 10 minutes of being in her office, we were interrupted twice to see if I was financing through the dealership. After her failed attempt, I paid my down payment and waited for Jennifer. More waiting. After she became available, she took me to my truck and showed me how to hook up the bluetooth. I asked her if my truck came with a care package ( nitrogen, lifetime tint, etc) and she wasnt sure if I purchased it. Instead of finding out, she left and that was it. My truck wasnt freshly washed nor was it pulled to the front of the building; It was in the parking lot with a bunch of irrelevant papers stuffed in the glove box. This was suppose to be a big moment for me and it was ruined. I didnt feel like she cared at all. On top of that, she never said a word about the features of the truck, warranty, care package, and uconnect.After getting home, and having time to play with my truck, I had a bunch of questions. I emailed her and emailed her and she never responded. Finally, I emailed someone else and she got Jennifer to respond to my emails. Instead of explaining her answers, she responded with a very short response. It clearly didnt answer my questions and I looked online. There was still one question I had so emailed the finance manager and then the sales manager. Nobody responded, and I've given up. I completely regret buying the truck through Gulfgate and I will never reccomend this dealer to anyone. Such a huge disappointment!",1.8

Once I left it I forgot to ask for a loaner car but once the  SD called me to let me know what issues it had I went ahead and asked for one. They use Enterprise and loan just a small car but since Enterprise was out of everything the SD was nice enough to accommodate me into a Truck which was exactly what I needed. I was called about 4 days after I left my vehicle to let me know it was ready.

I could not receive an appointment that day so they scheduled me forService when my parts came in. So November 1st parts come in and i take it back up there they do the work and i pick the car up. Get home the light comes back on. I call they say they don‚Äôt do service on the weekends and I‚Äôll have to bring it back Monday. I bring it back on Monday and they informed me that they ordered and changed the wrong part and that they would have to order the correct part and try again and keep in mind i told them i was due at work in Pennsylvania on November 3rd. They informed me that the parts are going to take couple days to come in and that there‚Äôs nothing that they can do and I just have to be patient. Needless to say i lost my job position. Today is November 8th and i finally finish. On top of that the only way you find out any information about your Vehicle is the call because nobody calls nobody relays messages you have to keep calling calling calling calling so you can speak to someone because the service department does not call back and does not update you on your vehicle at all.

We put $9,500 and a trade in of $1,500.We have not been happy at all!  we have still not been able to be in a vehicle of our choice that does not give us a check engine light after a few days of driving it. After realizing we were stuck, we signed on another truck and here we go again with the SAME PROBLEM! We are very disappointed in our purchase! We were told that we were over exaggerating! Although they have been giving us loaners, which by the way one of them shook when driving at times,  and they have been agreeing to fix the issue, this has still been disappointing! They went as far as to trying to charge us miles and bumper damage on the first truck, thankfully I had pictures proving that the damage was there the day we purchased it!

Anything that the warranty covered was supposed to be fixed (aprox $4500).2 days after getting my vehicle back, my check engine light came back on. My vehicle had also begin running hot. Ironically, this had NEVER happened prior to bringing my vehicle in. I brought it back to service again for these. Discovered a hose needed to be replaced. My warranty company covered another $882 visit. The next day, my check engine is on again. I feel like my initial problem was never properly addressed.  I feel like my warranty company is being milked for money. This is really common when women bring their car to dealerships alot of times. I am livid! I am about to take my car to O'Reilly.  When they let me know the reason for the engine light, I am going to tell the service department what to repair this time. I am really NOT a satisfied customer! Mark's customer service was excellent.

493,"July 10, 2019","In April I received an oil change and I asked the associate to have the mechanic check one of my tires because I was losing air pressure. I was informed by Johnathan that the tire could not be repaired and that I needed to buy a brand new tire that cost $170. I refused and asked for them to put the tire back on. I picked up my car with out any issues, so I thought. Fast forward to Wednesday 6/3, my tire started to lose pressure again and I took it to a tire shop. When they asked me for the key to the rims, I went in the glove compartment where the mechanic left it and there was no key in the container. I went to the dealership immediately and was told by Jonathan that I needed to come back Thursday morning so that the Manager can order new parts. I arrived this morning at 0830. About 20 minutes later. Johnathan gave me a new set and said that they match the ones I have on my car even after I asked him was he sure. I left and went straight to the tire shop and waited 2 hours for them to tell me the key didn‚Äôt match. I went back to the dealership very upset and crying hysterically when I was told I needed to leave my car and it would be a few hours. The only person that came to calm me down was a sales rep that actually sold me my car, Jaron. I received the rental at 1230 and I didn‚Äôt get my car back until 1630. I asked to speak with the manager and when I spoke with him he just looked at me as if I was speaking a different language. I expressed to him everything that happened and that this was the worse customer service I have ever experienced. He just nodded his head and said ok without an apology. My parents referred me to the dealership and I referred my niece but I will no longer do business or refer anyone else to the dealership. This was a big inconvenience and very time consuming.

I wanted to figure out what we could do and I was trying to explain the situation and one of the workers who sit behind Steven Hernandez desk (who I was trying to explain everything to) was very rude and did not want to even try to help me. Finally after all the miscommunication I got the rental. After all that, I finally got my car back a week later and all was well. I believe they just need better communication in the work area so if something like this happened again they could just pull up the information in the computer so we could avoid this problem. ",3.6

627,"May 15, 2019"," I had to drop off my truck for an oil leak diagnosis. It was apparently found but took about a week to fix. I was called to pick it up. Then immediately called again to cancel my pickup. Leak sprung again. Redo. Days later, called to pickup. I picked up my truck, leak sprung a few days later, while I was away for work. Brought it back as soon as I could. Again, leak diagnosed and took about a week to fix. I picked it up and the leak sprung again the next day. I hesitated to bring it back but my advisor Gary convinced me to. Gary was very professional and much help before, so I agreed. This time, he brought in a specialist to diagnose it. They found the real leak. I supposed it was in a harder-to-reach area than the tech would‚Äôve liked to check. Due to it being in that area, I was told it would at least take ten days. Things had to be taken out and whatnot. When I finally picked it up, I checked the summary and inspected my truck as I always do. Things usually line up. This time they did not. The summary stated a 13 mile road test had been done. But 80 miles were put on the odometer, half a tank of fuel had been burned, and the took of my black truck had white paint rubbed on top. Only caused by running through a clearance that is too low. Joyride or whatever you wanna call it. I went back inside before driving at all and confronted the service advisor staff, including the manager at the last desk. They agreed that i was right about what it looked like. Unfortunately, they shrugged it off as an ‚Äúoh well, xxxx happens‚Äù moment. Said nothing could be done for me since neither Gary, the diesel tech, nor the reimbursement guy were there. And that I could go back the next day if I wanted to be reimbursed for the fuel. I told them that I didn‚Äôt care about the $30 fuel reimbursement and that I wondered if that there were anything that could be done to convince me to keep my service here, if they cared about it. Once again I was met with blank stares. I‚Äôve got a 2017 Cummins and a 2014 Charger and I would buy all my parts here and get any service I couldn‚Äôt do myself here. Now i‚Äôll Go out of my way to river oaks or Dickinson. Wherever I can find decent service without my truck being someone‚Äôs toy. I would‚Äôve given 0 stars, but Gary was very helpful. Called at every step of the process and left a detailed message if I didn‚Äôt answer. ",2.2

653,"April 30, 2019",So I got a service with tire rotation done. A day later my tire sensor went out so I called to schedule an appointment.  I went in a week later on a scheduled day. They wanted me to leave my vehicle just to troubleshoot the sensor as if anyone has the luxury of just leaving a vehicle.  After an hour and a half of walking around outside i went in and tried to get an update from Steve. That arrogant jerk ignored me and acted as if i was not in front of him taking a call just pushing me off. But as soon as a young woman walked in the door he was quick to hang up and try to bend over backwards for her. So i asked that someone else help. Got the update from Luis. He came back and said the tech cleared the code and drove my truck 3 miles to see if the sensor would reset. I was worried because I have the progressive snapshot plugged in so I checked it. The logged report said the vehicle was on for about 2 minutes and that was when they moved it to the back. I asked how did they drive it if it was only on 2 minutes and I was outside the whole time never saw the truck leave. They could not answer. They said they fixed the sensor and let me go. A day later the fault code came back on and now they wont return my call so I can schedule another service. I will not recommend gulfgate dodge for any service other than a basic oil change. And not even for that. ,1.4

729,"March 26, 2019","I purchased my previous vehicle (2015 Chrysler 200) from her in 2015 and my salesperson at that time was Tyrone (he is so awesome).¬† I knew I was in need of another car (high mileage) and Juana called me about a special deal that was going on at the dealership so I decided to go in.

Juana was very patient, kind, empathic, and was listened to my every need.¬† I advised her of my budget and she worked hard at trying to get me the deal that I wanted; however she wasn‚Äôt successful.¬† She asked if I could meet with one of her managers about making a deal for me that I would be willing to compromise with and I agreed.

One of the managers, Alexis, approached me and advised me of two options that I had.¬† After I explained to him that neither option would work, he offered some unethical suggestions (i.e. stop paying on my current vehicle and just make payments on the new car) for me to consider so that he could make the deal.¬† He also stated that it really wouldn‚Äôt matter if I stop making payments on my car because my credit wasn‚Äôt the best (my credit is fair).¬† When I refused to follow suite, he returned back to his office to see if there were other options for me to consider.¬† At this point, I was irritated, frustrated, and overall disrespected at the horrible customer service I received from someone who is a manager.¬† I asked Juana for my keys and my id because I was ready to go and she obliged my request.

She walked me to my car and I advised Juana that it wasn‚Äôt her that I had an issue with, it was Alexis and the way he treated me (I did use a few choice words about my feelings and experience with the manager).¬† I explained to her that I didn‚Äôt like how he spoke to me, how he approached me with the deal, and how he attempted to belittle me about the decision that I was making towards the deal.¬† I told her that I did have a positive outlook on this place; however it has changed with me working with him.¬† She acknowledged my feelings and respected my decision.

Once I was getting ready to leave, another sales person approved me, Armando, who overheard some of the conversation that I had with Juana.¬† I explained to him the interaction that I had with Alexis and how I refused to be treated like that from someone who wants my business and that it was best for me to leave.¬† He acknowledged my feelings as well and provided his professional opinion about the deal.¬†

After leaving the dealership and evaluating my decision, I contacted Juana and was able to make a compromise (where I didn‚Äôt have to deal with Alexis) regarding the sale of the vehicle.¬† I was able to make my purchase and not interact with that manager in the process.¬† I was able to leave the dealership with what I wanted, which worked out at the end.

If it wasn‚Äôt for Tyrone, Juana, Armando, and Ms. Denise (in finance), I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this dealership nor would I have purchased my car from here again.¬† My suggestion would be to offer Alexis to attend customer service training, respect customers‚Äô decisions, morals, and ethical beliefs, don‚Äôt approach deals with unethical recommendations, and be cognitive of the words that are being used when he is communicating with customers.¬†

868,"February 04, 2019","My friend and I went in to Gulfgate a few weeks ago to look at a preowned vehicle. I had called ahead to tell them what we saw online and to have the vehicle ready for us to look at and they gave us the name of a salesman to speak with when we arrived. We arrived at the dealership and the salesman was busy so we were then told to speak with Anwar, who never actually introduced himself as I had to ask for his name after we left. We looked at the car and automatically didn‚Äôt like it because it was a smokers vehicle and then looked at another and test drove it. As we got into the car to test drive, the manager saw us in the vehicle with the salesman and said, ‚ÄúThis looks like a crime waiting to happen. A white man, a black man, and two asian girls.‚Äù I could not believe that racist remark came out of the manager‚Äôs mouth but we just ignored it at the time.  The vehicle we test drove was an Infiniti and the salesman knew nothing about the vehicle but the obvious features. We brought up seat warmers and he didn‚Äôt even know if the car had them and brushed it off like nothing. We got back from the test drive and talked about the car and ultimately decided it was not the perfect car so we weren‚Äôt going to try and buy the vehicle and when we said we didn‚Äôt like something about the car, the salesman was very rude with his responses. I did not like the fact that the vehicle was a rental and had many drivers in and out of the vehicle and the salesman gave us strong attitude when I said that and said, ‚ÄúWell what are you expecting with a used car?‚Äù Then the disrespectful salesman thanked us for wasting his time and then asked if we would talk to his manager so he ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt get in trouble‚Äù. We went and talked to the racist manager who was slightly nicer, although he questioned our opinions on the vehicle and that was very disrespectful and uncouth as that just made the situation worse. When we specifically told the manager we wanted seat warmers, he said, ‚ÄúReally? Seat warmers in Texas?‚Äù Ironically is was 40 degrees that morning. So then we left and went on our two hour journey home as we came from out of town. The next day my friend realized she couldn‚Äôt find her license and wondered if the salesman had given it back we he made a copy for the test drive. Well I call and turns out he left the license in the copy machine so we asked if they would mail it back as we live two hours out of town. They said they would and almost two weeks later she still hadn‚Äôt received her license. So I call again a week later after them not answering the phone once and they said they still have the license and will send it out soon. Well she finally got it one and a half weeks later after that phone call with no sort of explanation or apology. Overall, I am absolutely not pleased with the horrendous experience I had at Gulfgate Dodge and would never buy a new or used vehicle from Gulfgate. Unprofessional staff is absolutely unacceptable and I refuse to tolerate it.",1.0

1054,"November 07, 2018","I came to Gulfgate with my debit card out ready to purchase a vehicle.  After the test drive I was even more convinced to buy.  However, the price sheet brought back to me was roughly $3500 more than the price advertised online (which is why I came to your dealership...the advertised price).  Jaron explained the warranty that was added to the car, he also mentioned it was a way for the dealership to recoup some of the labor cost for prepping the vehicle.  After I told him I was not going to pay more than the advertised price, he got his manager.  His manager confirmed that he would not sell the car for less than the elevated warranty price.

After the director's departure, I continued discussions with Jaron, I expressed my displeasure of the bait and switch tactic.  Jaron began to tell me I was a bad consumer because if I didn't pay the elevated price I was preventing him from supporting his daughter.  This was the absolute worst sales tactic I have ever seen.

At this point I walked out of the Used Car building and went straight to NEw Car building asking for the GM.  I met a gentleman named, I believe his name was Carl, whom I explained my entire experience with.  HE left me for a minute, I assume to speak with Jaron and his team.  The GM returned and honored the advertised price.  I left with the vehicle I wanted.

1106,"October 22, 2018","Joe was the salesman that we worked with and he was great! He was very helpful and ultimately got me to a price I was willing to pay. One complaint I have is that every vehicle on the lot has a package of accessories already on the vehicle that can‚Äôt be taken off. It‚Äôs advertised on the vehicle with a sticker price of around $1200, which led me to believe it was an option. During the negotiation the accessories package jumped up to $3300 and when I voiced that I wasn‚Äôt interested and that could be taken off I was told all of the accessories were already on the vehicle and couldn‚Äôt be taken off. And also, what led me to come to Gulfgate Dodge was the online price, which this accessories package was not included in although all of the vehicles on the lot have it. I was ultimately offered a great deal on the vehicle so I was willing to deal with that issue. My second complaint, when I got to financing, I was pushed to finance through Chrysler Capital because the dealership would be ‚Äúlosing too much money if they didn‚Äôt get the incentive money‚Äù from me financing through them. I have good credit and my interest rate is 12.8% which is outrageous because I was preapproved for 3.09%. I only financed through them to avoid losing my rebate but I will be refinancing with my preapproval rate. So like the title says, I‚Äôm grateful I was able to get a good deal on my new truck, but it wasn‚Äôt easy getting there in my opinion. ",3.6

1119,"October 17, 2018","I was immediately greeted at my car when I pulled up by a gentleman in the service area. He directed my inside after I mentioned a scheduled appointment and from there, everything went down hill as far as customer service. I wasn‚Äôt certain where to go from there so stood around for a few minutes. After a few mins of no assistance, I walked up to the gentleman ‚Äòs desk closest to the entrance and as I tried to ask if I needed to sign in he immediately said ‚Äúthere are two other people in front of you‚Äù. No welcome, we‚Äôll be with you shortly, just short direct comment as if he was already overwhelmed in his day. 
I just stood around until a young gentleman took the initiative to ask if I needed assistance, as he probably could see the list look on my face. He apologized for the wait, asked for my name and what assistant was he could help with. I let him know if my scheduled appointment and he looked up who I was assigned to. He took me over to Luis‚Äôs desk, pointed him out, as he was outside helping another customer, and said he would be with me afterwards. 
As I was standing next to his desk, Luis walked right up and immediately jumped on his computer to finish up; no greeting again, even just to acknowledge me that he would be with me shortly. After I asked if he was Luis, give me a minute. 
After the numerous examples of lack of employee customer service, I left my car to be serviced for a 9:30 appt. I received a call about 2:30 that it was done. I got there to pick it up and Luis informed me they did as much as they could. I assumed he wanted me to be ok with that as he seemed to be a little surprised as I asked him what that meant. He went on to explain they did all they could for my wheel alignment but I would need to take my vehicle to a body shop. He then let me know he would not charge me the full price, as if he were doing me a favor. I asked a few additional questions but could see that we weren‚Äôt going anywhere. He didn‚Äôt seem interested in helping me understand my situation and what the issue would do moving forward. I still don‚Äôt fully understand and need to follow up but overall would not recommend anyone to your service department.

Needless to say I didn't buy the car. No trade in, came to dealer with USAA approved financing, and somehow they couldn't honor their own printed/advertised online price!! The salesman was friendly and really easy to talk to, and I don't blame him for this. Prices are obviously generated from higher up the chain, but being told one thing and a dealer doing another, is not ok in my opinion",1.5

1173,"September 30, 2018","My expreience has been Super Pathetic post visiting the Dealership. I was looking for a Resale Car. Searching through Cargurus it directed me to this Website GulfGateDodge for a Nissan Altima 2017 with 11000 Miles for a price of $12995. I saw there was no accident reported. I called the dealer on 29th Sep and the person who picked up the call asked for the Stock Number.829339A. She confirmed , yes the vehcile is available but as the Dealership is Closed on Saturdays , I can only look at the car the next day Sunday. She asked me what time I intend to come. I said around 11.30am on 30 Sep. She said ""Joe"" would be my Contact person. On Sunday the dealership called around 11.30 to check if I am going to visit or not. I said Sorry I am late but I would be there around 12.30-12.45pm. She confirmed sounds good , and my contact person now would be ""Xavian"". I reach the dealership and searched for Xavian where he said he is busy with a Customer and someone else would assist me. I waited for around 10 mins and was greeted by an extremely fine person Mr.Raul. I had to explain and give the stock number specifically which I have come for. He was unable to find the stock and said in that case the car might be in workshop. I was a bit surprised a car which was in Stock for Sale for 43 days is in workshop. I requested him to verify. After 10 mins he came back with a ""Sorry message that the car is Sold the previous day."" I was amazed. I said but your dealership is Closed on Saturdays. Then he said the Sales Person sold the car on Friday and did the Delivery on Saturday. I was Extremely Disappointed with the False Information and sheer headache of travelling 20miles to hear this crap. I said can I meet the Manager. I went with him and the Manager said he will come in sometime. I waited more than 15 mins. Then another person Jimmy informed the Manager again. After 10 mins I was asked to go to his desk. There the fun starts. I told him the list of events and I was shocked to hear his response. Here I quote George Nabbout "" We do not update the inventory so frequently in the Website/Internet. Moreover these inventory may may not be there but once the Customer is here then we try to sell whatever inventory we have. These Internet Inventory & Pricing is to Attract Customers"". I asked why dont you put ""Pending Sale"" , he said since our inventory is too low it does not make to update every minute by minute Inventory status . For him it meant its fine to give incorrect information to Customers as they are to attract Customers. I was Super Upset. I was thinking what crap dealership , what is the difference between roadside Dealerships and these big branded ones. Then I thought to come back to get his name for Review. When I came , obviously I was frustrated , I said "" Your names please"" , he said ""george"" , can you please give me the full name. Then he gave me his Business Card. Then I was leaving & he called ""excuse me"" and said in extremely rude manner "" why are you giving me such a ""f*** o**"" look & some more derogatory words"" I said back. I don't think I ever said those words nor my action prompted those behavior, I requested you to speak outside so that there is no scene amongst your customers & subordinates just in case you are a Manager."" His words"" I have nothing to hide , I have 4 College Degress, and from your appearance it seems you are also educated college degrees & .....( that I have means & resources). I dont know how many years you are in this country but I am here for 30 years & lot of jibber jabber.."" . I said again ""I have not done anything derogatory nor shouted nor raised my voice unlike you are ,  yes I am very upset and angry and I feel cheated because of wrong information which for you was super casual as it is your part of normal business cycle"". Then he said ""Yes that specific deal was a steal , i know $13000, 11k miles Altima , anybody will grab for it. I dont think you will die if you dont get that car today. I am sure this probably is going to be 2nd or 3rd car just because its a steal deal. If you want I can call you once we have such cars and miles & you can come."" I actually was super upset with his way of behaviour , I left my name and number. But inside I was sure never to visit this dealership ever.  And the best part , all time he was sitting in his chair , there was not even a chair for the Customer . Hence I was standing & he was blabbering sitting. Being in a Customer Service industry I really feel pity for him. He is really lucky to have a very good Manager else by now I would have fired him , a very can be very good at his target n numbers but a person with wrong attitude can spoil the name & create a bad atmosphere for other team members & the organization Goals.. I feel extremely sad for this Organization & Leaders .. My advice , DO NOT visit the dealership directly if you have some stock seen over the internet. Speak with a Sales Person & verify if the stock # & price is there. I saw some Google Reviews where few have complained that , they even has bumped up the price & did not honor website pricing. There seems to be an integrity issue with this dealership , hence visit at your own risk & luck. This happened specific to ""Pre Owned Car"" Division.",1.0

Immediately after the repair, my car started acting horribly. After a bad experience at Bayway, I took my car to Gulfgate.

I let them know that Bayway replaced a computer part, and the part was most likely bad because the problem started happening immediately after the part was replaced. Instead of immediately checking the service history on my car to verify what I told them, they took 2 months to verify. They saw that the PCM was replaced, not the TIPM. This is a fact that could have been cleared up on Day 1 with proper communication. 
My car spent over 2 months at the dealership. When I would call, they would promise to give me a call back in 30 minutes, that afternoon, etc. Often it would take several days or over a week to get a call back.

I just think it was very unprofessional to speak in that way and the way he was getting loud to another employee who was not saying anything to him. There were plenty of customers still there and everyone stood silent that‚Äôs how obnoxious this man was. I did not get his name but i will be there this weekend and i can assure i can find that out. Also no one, that worked there said anything to him everyone was just so quick to leave and did not care nor apologized for such obnoxious rude behavior, i would hate to have that guy be of service to me.

1256,"September 03, 2018","This was the worst car buying experience ever. I was even a car salesman myself once, and I have never seen a lower of level of shady than at Gulfgate Dodge. 

They pull the bait and switch with their internet sales prices. beware! then they try and add ""accessories"" to the sales price of the vehicle. 

then, not telling me what you will give me on my trade before knowing the payoff. remember, they are going to give you what they are going to give you, regardless of what you do or do not owe on your trade in. 

then finance is even shadier, adding points to the interest rate of the loan and trying to convince someone with an 850 credit score that 6% is Chryslers best rate. 

do your homework before coming here. do not pay for ""accessories"" and get your own financing if possible. 

also, be prepared to spend countless hours going back and forth on pricing. and pay attention to how they are structuring your deal!

Then be prepared for the new vehicle to not get detailed or washed. We had to wait another day for delivery for a battery to be changed! ",1.0

We workout a price and he seems willing to sell it for that amount. He then proceeds to tell me that for this specific car they are not accepting outside financing.

Of course the not accepting outside financing was not stated then. I then proceed to wait and see what happened. I was not contacted or followed up by any of the three salesman I talked to. I clearly wanted to work out something and drive off the lot with the specific car I was inquiring about. All I got were excuses as to why I could not buy the car.

Very disappointed in Gulf Gate Dodge- the actions of one, ruin our whole view on this business (and that‚Äôs sad, because our sales rep, was great, and they lost out on a sale - plus a waste of several hours today because of Andrew‚Äôs behavior.) if this is how this business operates, the business will not survive; from what I‚Äôve read, several other people have my same viewpoint on their experience there too!

1468,"June 12, 2018","I came in Sunday 6.10.18 to buy my first car from a dealership. I've owned cars before but never one less than 10 years old. And I know my credit is bad, so I didn't get my hopes up. I received a letter from Capitol One pre-approving me so I went in to see what could be done. I was shown 2 cars in my range. I knew I needed something better than the oil leaking no a/c old explorer I had so I picked the 2014 Jeep Patriot. The sales guy helping me was good, wasn't as informative as i feel he could have been when it came to some numbers, but did answer everything I asked. Actually taking the car home is when everything did a complete 180.....I only made it 20 minutes away from the dealership before I was sitting on the side of the road. I called my sales guy only for him to tell me there was anything that could done at the moment I don't think he was understanding that I couldn't drive the car and something was wrong. I was crying. This inst at all how it was supposed to go, and he wasn't helping the situation. By the 3rd or 4th time I had to pull over on the side of the road I called to speak to a manager (Ryan) at the dealership, I explained what was going on, he told me to come back and he would have a loner gassed up and ready for me while they put my car in the shop in the morning, I was so overly grateful for him. I got back and my sales did not come off very nice or friendly when I came back. I was over it at that point and just wanted to go home. The next day by lunch time I had not heard anything about my car so I called and talked to somebody in the service department who told him that they did have my car at but they were still running tests to find out what was wrong and that my sales guy would call me back. I finally got a text 2 hours later for my sales guy saying the car was in the service department and being looked at that he would let me know whenever he knew something. I didn't hear anything for the rest of the night finally this morning he text me and told me that the car was ready for me to pick up when I asked what was wrong with it he told me that he would have the Diagnostics paper ready for whenever I got there. Now for what happened I was driving my Jeep Patriot and my traction control keep turning on and off in my life my throttle control kept turning on every time I like my throat culture and turns on I lose the ability to accelerate which for anybody who lives in Houston knows is not a great thing when you're doing 80 miles an hour down the freeway with you. I ended up having to pull over turn off the car and turn it back on four times before I finally made it back to the dealership to get a loaner. Naturally I looked it up and this is a fairly common problem with these cars it's just something that has to be replaced. I went back to the dealership after work to get my car and talk to Ryan in person. Talking to Ryan about everything helped a lot! I feel so much better about my decision and love my car. Everything was fixed and straightened out. And naturally the first thing I did, just like most girls with a new car, was go to the store and buy stuff to make my car smell good and look pretty. :)",5.0

1508,"May 16, 2018","Finally went in for a test drive. Weren‚Äôt thinking of buying but with a good deal we‚Äôd be interested. We test drove a JGC 25th Sterling Edition in red but I told the Sales Rep Chris that we were interested in white.  Chris showed us several models and then convinced us to go inside and look at inventory and see if he could get us a good deal given it was mother's day and there was an extra $1k rebate. Found a white a 2017 Limited but they didn‚Äôt have it (although site said they had 6). Asked to price a JGC High Altitude. We submitted info to look at numbers. Sales Manager Mike Chapa came and gave us initial numbers with rates possibly less than 5%. At one point we mentioned just looking at numbers and weren‚Äôt thinking of buying...Mike immediately pushed his chair back and was about to stand up to leave when I stopped him and said we were discussing numbers. Obviously our time was not worth his. At that moment I advised them that the info on the sheet was not correct as we were interested in the white JGC and not the red JGC. Mike pulled up the correct information and notated all the rebates and said no worries its about the same so it‚Äôs fine. We had asked for a lower rate so he went back again. When he came back we again discussed rates but also advised him that we could get a better rate with our bank. He said ok and that he would re-verify rebates. He left again. At this time Chris (who has been more than awesome throughout this whole thing) comes and tells us Mike had agreed to the price and since our bank was closed they would let us sign the paper with the agreed amount, take the vehicle and then come back during the week to finalize the transaction. Chris advised that the $1k rebate for Mother‚Äôs Day had not been added and I also advised that I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable signing without the correct vehicle information being listed. He went back to have everything corrected only to have Mike come back and tell us the price was now $3k more because they realized there was a difference. My husband told him we had identified from the beginning which vehicle we were looking at and that he stated it was about the same but he stated he never said such a thing. Needless to say we walked out only to be called later by Mike, who left a voicemail, stating they would do the deal at the price we agreed but yet when we called back Chris tells us Mike told him to tell us they would do it for $4400 more. Tried speaking to Mike the next day; he tried blaming Chris for everything but I corrected him and told him Chris was not at fault; he began to yell and then hung up on me. Spoke to the General Sales Manager Ryan Martin who stated he had heard about the situation and had asked Mike to call to accept the price. He stated he would look further into it, take a look at the numbers and would call back within 45mins...it‚Äôs been 2 days and no call back. Overall Chris was great; invested his time on us even though we weren‚Äôt completely sure we‚Äôd be buying that day. Mike on the other hand obviously didn‚Äôt want to take the time with us, his word is worthless; unprofessional and rude. GSM Ryan phone call was ok but he hasn‚Äôt returned the call...guess he didn‚Äôt want to invest time in us either.

Every time I go to the dealership regarding my vehicle, Jeep can‚Äôt seem to diagnose the problem appropriately. I just took it recently and I was told it wasn‚Äôt the transmission but something else which they are suggesting is the problem. To fix the problem they state is happening to my vehicle is going to be $900 when the parts only cost $300. If this really isn‚Äôt the problem, then I have to go back again and then it might be the transmission? Doesn‚Äôt make sense. Several other mechanics have diagnosed my vehicle and they all say it is the transmission that needs to be repaired. Instead, it seems as though the dealership wants to pay $900 for something they think is the problem when they could have replaced my transmission under warranty from the very beginning. I‚Äôve been at this for several months already and I even called the manufacture to file a complaint. Yet my vehicle, still needs to be repaired. ",3.0

The absolute WORST place to purchase a vehicle. The staff doesn't communicate, managers don't return calls and don't take your concerns seriously, oh and how could I forget DON'T APPRECIATE YOUR BUSINESS. 

Andrew Cordova, GM? Hm, you couldn't get the GM to answer the phone even if your life depended on it.

The Finance guy in Used Cars, Ryan? I don't know which habit it worst, lying or not returning people's calls.

Our Salesman Mike? How could I forget! He forgot us after we purchased our used vehicle. Dodging calls after making excuse after excuse. 

Christian in Used Sales? Pathetic Car Salesman who is dumbfounded at any and all questions.

My husband and I walked into that dealership with a trade in and put our application in with Ryan to drive out with a 17' Dually and a 15' Charger. Well, turns out all we got was the xxxxing run around. We were told approval for both of the vehicles THEN we were told only the charger but that he could FOR SURE get us into the SLT 2500 buuuut the next day told us that we couldn't get into it despite his promise SO he told us we could get into a car as long as it was under $35000 SO we pick a 17' Jeep for 31,9 and even with a co-signer this guy promised he could get me in it and even let me drive it off the lot. 4 days later (mind you, they never called us to update us) we call and call to get a hold of someone and when we do (Christian) he informed us that we were approved and in the single digits. GREAT RIGHT!? No. We called later on the way up there and he informed us that he was misinformed and I wasn't approved. I was pissed. After sitting in that lobby for 5 hours Thursday, which have Salesman running around cussing and not acting professional while I have my toddler with me I was ready to be done. I am waiting for a gift card currently that we were advertised and promise up until signing when everyone decided to not even return our calls, not like they did in the first place. I have been waiting for about 3 weeks now. It is advertised and promised at signing but yet no one will acknowledge our xxxxty customer service, unbeknownst to them, right? Wrong. My husband has reached out to Mr. Cordova and let me tell you that this man can't return a call if your life depended on it. 

The dealership is flawed to say the least but the real crack in the foundation comes down to the staff. 

Don't waste your time. Don't waste the trip because all you'll get is disappointment and empty promises from incompetent Salesman just making a buck.

1727,"July 08, 2017","I did lots of research on the VEHICLE I wanted... but I didn't do enough on the DEALER.



I purchased a 2017 Chevrolet equinox  07/06/2017 and the advertised sale price online was $19,800. When I got home, I realized the sale price on the contract said $22,800 which is $3000 above the Internet price. The next day I called the dealership and let them know why was the sale price change from $19,800 to $22,800 and they stated because there was a mandatory warranty that I had to purchase. I advised them that I didn't want that warranty and they told me it was mandatory or else they weren't going to be able to honor the Internet price. I let them know that they can't force me to purchase a warranty or service contract if I don't want to and they simply stated that it was too late I already agreed and signed the contract. I know it was my fault for not verifying the numbers on the contract but this dealership operates with deceptive practices in order to increase their profits and they hide everything from you and just make you sign really quick. By law warranties are free and service contract should be charged as a separate line item on the contract instead of increasing the sale price of the vehicle. I am in the process of filing a complaint with the OCCC, CFPB, and DMV to expose these illegal practices.",1.0

1748,"December 11, 2016","SCAMMERS, SCAMMERS, and nothing but SCAMMERS!!!! Stay away from them.

They are the biggest cheaters. They advertise lower prices on internet (or even in store) and when you turn up and finalize the figures they throw in additional $3000 for 3 months of warranty....xxx...I can buy a whole new car for that much money! Or buy extended warranty for a car for next 3 years (and not 3 months). And to make it worse, you are not given the option whether you want it or not. YOU MUST PAY IF YOU WANT THE CAR. So, the lower price that was advertised was all BS and this dealership was 15-20% more expensive than other dealerships when you add the extra MANDATORY $3000. 

DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME GOING TO THIS DEALERSHIP. I called the dealership more than 10 times before I drove almost 2 hours to get the car I liked. Not once (and I talked to 2-3 different salesman) did they mention anything about the additional $3000 mandatory certification fee.  I even talked to their manager when we were there why this was not mentioned, he was completely rude and said I am the cheapest that why people like you drive up 2 hours to get the car....yes people drive up 2 hours when you advertise the correct price, but then CHEAT people with additional $3000 and then no one buys it from you!

The salesman kept saying he has no negotiation power, really!

For me personally, it was even worse. I went there week prior to my above interaction as well and at that time the car that I had picked had already sold 2 days prior and the sales man did not even know even though I called and confirmed before I left my house. So, I drove 2 hours to find out the car was never there. 

Very bad experience this dealership and the manager was completely rude with full of bad attitude!

When I took the vehicle in for service I explained the oil leak as well so the service advisor explained that she would have it looked at. They did a dye diagnosis to find out where the leak was and told me to come back in a week and they also had to order a cable for the antenna which would take about a week. I called back to take the vehicle in for the cable and was told unfortunately the cable was on back order it it could take up to a year. The advisor was very nonchalant and I'm here thinking this is the type of thanks I get with my new vehicle purchase. So then I questioned about the leak and the advisor told me to drive it another few miles and then come back. I refused and told her that I would NOT go any further because if it's something major it could make the problem worse. She ended up scheduling an appt and there was an oil leak, which they fixed.

Other small dealerships and even carmax wouldnt give me what i wanted and needed, so to Gulfgate Dodge I go!!! I went in on a tuesday and talked to a few people, gave them some info and they said they would work something out for me. Wednesday Chelsea in finance called me and said here's what we can do for you. I informed Chelsea that I would like a cheaper note than my previous car. She said she would work some numbers and call me back. She did!!! Thursday she called with some of the best news in the world!!! An all black avenger, 2010, $650 down and $460 a month!!! I could have done a back flip if I wasnt at work!!! Juan, John, Chelsea, and ""Jon Jon"" were so helpful and REAL!!! I say real because at first I was asking for a lot and didnt have much to bring to the table and they would tell me straight up that will not work. I loved the honesty because if they would have lied and said sure we can do that then I would have expected it, but they didnt, they were real and they ensured me that I would get what I want for the price I want, with what i can bring. Cool with me. On a side note I appreciate the info and insight Chelsea gave me in regards to my credit and how to build it up a little. I am 26 and still young so anything info that will help me progress in life I soak it up like a sponge. So I got my car, awesome, great and ""genuine"" service, and learned some things about credit. Can't beat that!!! God Bless and thank everybody that helped me at Gulfgate Dodge. Oh I pass up Dodge 2 dealerships form my house to get to Gulfgate Dodge and I will continue to purchase my cars from them simply because of the service. I am in managment at my job, and I know good service when I get it, and the service that I recieved at Gulfgate Dodge will go a long way with me....I will tell everybody I know about the service and standards the employees have at GULFGATE DODGE HOUSTON TEXAS!!!! God Bless you all, and I will see you all again in 18 months!!! :)",5.0
1790,"March 01, 2011",My husband and I purchased a 2010 Jeep Wrangler on 2/28/2011 from GulfGate Dodge. We are extremely pleased with our experience. We live in Conroe and refuse to work with our local Dodge Dealer.  We hate the whole process of purchasing a vehicle. Gulfgate Dodge is the best dealer we have ever worked with. We highly recommend them and will buy from them again.. Thanks to all the wonderful staff for a job well done.  The only complaint we have is our vehicle was not cleaned very well when we picked it up. ,4.8
1791,"January 23, 2011","Felt everything was fair and quick, hate spending all day at dealer ships! This place is locally owned so I chose to go to them for the family feel of the dealership. Saleman was more of a friend helping me out, then a overbearing person forcing me into something I didn't want.",4.6
