0,"August 17, 2016","I bought from Ancira because I thought they would take care of me and I didn't mind paying extra.  I was so wrong!!

They don't service Fiats in San Antonio.  You have to drive to Austin which I agreed to.  The issue is that I bought a 2015 Fiat in 2016 and the car keeps having problems.

My best friend had dealt with the Ancira on Bandera.  I should have done the same.  When I call the location on IH-10, they are terribly unhelpful.  Having car problems is frustrating enough.  Who needs all this frustration?

I should have just bought a used vehicle off Hildebrand Ave or San Pedro Ave.  I would have saved myself the a few thousand and a lot of frustration.

1,"October 16, 2013","I took my car in several times and they kept saying nothing was wrong I finally put my foot down and talked to the mechanic personally who was very nice unlike the advisor. They said they would call me and never did so I called them  for a status to find out my car has been ready for hours and the parts they need are in back order and will take 3 weeks. It's been over a month and still no word on the parts I call and that say ""im sorry someone will call you back"" but no one ever does.  I may be a young female but im not stupid little do they they im a certified aircraft mechanic. ",1.0
