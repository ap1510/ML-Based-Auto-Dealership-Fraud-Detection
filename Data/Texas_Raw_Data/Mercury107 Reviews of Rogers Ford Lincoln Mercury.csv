The Roger's team made it easy to help us understand the details of the vehicles we were looking at, and when it came time for our purchase, the process was quick, hassell free and very professional.

So many times when one thinks about the process of buying a vehicle, we all want to avoid the delays, the hours at the dealership, the pressure of the sale... with Rogers Ford, none of those issues came up, it was a comfortable quick process, and I felt great about making the decision to buy from Rogers.

We love the vehicle, and we expect that for our next vehicle we will be back at Rogers again.",4.8

40,"May 03, 2019","Walked into the dealership after several phone conversations, Randall, our sales guy bent over backwards to get us into the vehicle we had picked out, worked on our trade-in so we'd get a real good deal, he explained everything to us. What made him outstanding as a sales person was that he never pushed us, instead he worked with us, which made the purchasing experience so much better as being lead on a leash, Bo who took care of us in the finance department was also amazing. I told him what I wanted to pay every month, how much I was going to put down and he crunched numbers until we got as close as possible to what we wanted to spend. He was very patient, talked and listened and we ended up with an even better financing solution than my wife and I had hoped for. All in all, if you need a vehicle, give Roger's Ford a shot. You won't regret it.",5.0

44,"March 30, 2019","I have been using the lube department for several years. This was the first time to use the Service Dept. I had a recall notice from ford. I called the day before I wanted to bring the truck in so I would know the procedure. The day I called I spoke to Joseph and he gave me the instructions. The next morning I was met by Joseph who took me through the process of signing up the truck. He then got me a ride home.  He called a short time later to advise the truck was ready. He met me at the door to get my truck back. It was as if I was Joseph's only customer. Rogers Ford has found a fine young man to be working with loyal Ford owners. Terry Youngblood.

I was referred to Rogers Ford and they suggested I speak to Todd Robinson and so I did.
I explained I did not have to greatest experiences trying to get a Special-Order Raptor from other dealers and he asked what options I wanted and explained the order process and how long it would take.
He placed the order that day and 3 months later I am driving the exact truck I wanted.

71,"August 07, 2018","The worst dealership ever. I have 2011 ford escape that needed a fuel pump back in october 2017, i replaced it with an after market part. In January 2018 ford sent me a recall letter for the fuel pump. Took the car to rogers ford midland and had it replaced and they through the after market one away. my car worked fine with the after market one from October till January when they told me we have to put an original part instead. Anyway the fuel pump failed again in February then march, may, june and july. I called the mother ford company (ford headquarter) and a supervisor called me, it was so silly, he tried to tell me that the issue has been handled and they‚Äôve been giving me loaners all this time and the warranty on the recall is 12 months even if they cannot fix it, and he actually said (SIR IF YOUR ARE NOT SATISFIED YOU CAN TAKE YOUR CAR TO ANOTHER DEALERSHIP OR YOUR A MICHANICH) with an angry voice. Anyway the Last time in july when they had my car, they called me to bring the loaner back because they have discovered that they mistakenly replaced the fuel pump five times and the issue is not related to the recall problem and it‚Äôs something called ‚Äúfuel major‚Äù.
The service manager convinced me that this fuel major will fix the issue but i have to pay for it which is fine by me just get it fixed. Today 8/7/2018 i picked up my car and paid $220 for the part. As soon as i parked my car at the apartment it won‚Äôt start again and have the same issue. I will never ever buy ford or fix anytging with ford. ",1.2

I have one work vehicle and I depend on that truck for my livelyhood. no work no pay.

So that night I put it on a charger, the next morning it started and I wen to work, that afternoon we were able to get off a little bit early 4;30 pm,  so I called the Rogers Ford Fast Lube center and asked what time they closed (600 pm), I told the my situation and that I was about 45 mins to 1 hour away and could they change both batteries in my 2015 F350, they told me to bring it in and they would get it done. The traffic in our area to say the least is terrible but anyway I pulled up to the Fast Lune Center it was 5:40 pm, they Fast Lune center was very courteous first of all, and I asked if they had time to change out both batteries on my truck. They asked didn‚Äôt you call earlier of course I said yes and they said ‚Äúwe told you to bring it here and we would change them, that‚Äôs what we will do‚Äù . Thank You Rogers Ford Fast Lube Center, I truly appreciate what you do. Excellent Service Quality ",5.0
98,"December 04, 2017",I was impressed with the service we received at the ford dealership in Midland. We started wanting a used car and was treated the same as we were if buying a new car. We ended up buying a 2018 Ford. I teased the guy about it being my bday and wanted a picture on the wall. I was shocked when he came out with it. We have used the same dealer in NorthDakota for 20 years and we now found one for the next 20 years. Thx Frankie for outstanding service.,5.0
99,"December 01, 2017",My new truck purchase was the best experience I've had yet at a car dealership.  Daniel and Armando did an excellent job helping me get my vehicle.  Highly recommending Rogers Ford to family and friends. ,5.0
100,"November 24, 2017","Sid in sales did an excellent job finding the vehicle I wanted at a good price.  The sales manager was also friendly as excellent to deal with as part of closing.  In addition, the service manager went beyond the call, introducing himself and offering their service when needed.

I have bought a number of cars from Rogers over the last 15 + years, will do so again, and count on their service department too.",4.8

103,"November 07, 2017",Ron was excellent to deal with. Always took what I said towards the deal to heart and didn‚Äôt try to be pushy. Would definitely recommend Ron for any future sales.,4.8
104,"May 15, 2016","I wouldn't buy from this place if they were the last car dealer on Earth! The salesman I was with was very rude, unfriendly and very unprofessional. He kept sighing in what seemed like annoyance when I would ask about a truck or another deal. He got angry when I told him the price they initially brought me was too high and stormed off. When I showed him the Ford rebate that was being offered on the new trucks, he took my phone and went to the floor manager without asking my permission to take my phone. Just yanked it out of my hands and off he went. The floor manager came back and tried to tell me they were not going to offer the rebate and when I tried to get him to explain it to me, he became very irate and very rude. When I finally asked if he was going to help me at all, he stood up and started to say he wasn't going to waste his time but stopped himself and that If I could find the deal I wanted at another dealership to let him know and he'd go buy all their trucks. Very rude, very unprofessional staff that works here. They obviously do not care about their customers, only their bottom line. I am never going back to Rogers Ford.",1.0
105,"April 10, 2010",If you are in the area... you are better off going to Sewell Ford in Odessa. These people think that they are so good that they can sell to anyone! My husband and I have great credit but they could not keep our payments on a brand new mustang to what we wanted so we went to Sewell and they went ABOVE and BEYOND what any other dealership has done for us!,1.6
106,"June 05, 2004","Promised me a car with little or no money down. They used this terminology to get me into the dealership. When I went down there, they lied and said they never said any such thing. When I provided written proof they had said it, they simply cut off all communication with me. One of the most dishonest dealerships I have ever encountered in 30 years of car buying. I recommend going on down the road to Sewell Ford in Odessa, or go to Stanton. I would avoid Rogers Ford like the plague.",1.0
