0,"October 15, 2016","Streater Smith is above and beyond the best Nissan dealership in Texas.I have shopped for Trucks in every Nissan dealership from Fort Worth to Bourne To Beaumont Houston Austin etc. I have owned 3 Nissan Frontier and now a 2017 Titan purchased and maintained by Streater Smith. My service contact Meagan has gone above and beyond for me in every way possible and beyond continuously for the last 2 years. Steven Rowland and Leo Arias went above and beyond in every avenue to make sure we were more than happy in a situation we were completely comfortable in. Baker Nissan ripped us off,damaged our windshield, lied countless times and ignored our phone calls from the original sales person up to the dealership manager and finance man. Baker Nissan is Scandalis and full of liars. The staff at Streater Smith exposed their lies and took every step in their power to ensure us a great deal on an excellent vehicle. Steven Rowland literally gave me the jacket off of his back. Leo Arias treated us like we were family. Jennifer has always be the most polite and accommodating service consult you could ever ask for. These people are true, kind and good hearted people who are truly there to help you find the right vehicle for you and your family. Mr. Traylor in financing is a true man of integrity. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT go anywhere other then Streater Smith.",5.0
1,"October 12, 2016","The purchase process is managed well. Any questions or concerns after the sale, you are going to be ignored.  Their service department is unethical, slow, continuously up sells, and lies about issues that should be addressed but are of no consequence.  I recently spent nearly a day watching them pick customers pockets while they were unable to resolve a simple rattle on my vehicle.

2,"October 12, 2015","I recently experienced a unethical practice with the dealership.  I purchased a new car, after having a flat tire I learned the tire was plugged / patched, my tire was destroyed and the dealership would not replace the tire. The Sales Director was rude and unprofessional, he flat out accused me of lying when I told him I know nothing about the plugged tire. Think about it, if you were sold a car with tires that have been plugged/patched you will never know unless you have a flat, by that time the dealer will just deny they sold you a car with used tires and you have no way of proofing it. Sounds like a snake oil sales trick, yeah you better believe it!",1.0

6,"July 12, 2015","On 07/11/2015 I was told by the Manager Greg to come in even though Capital One pre-approval letter said I had to have an income of 1800 or above. I called to cancel the appointment, but he said he would call Capital One and see if he could get things worked out. He called me back and said they will approve me even though my income was below the 1800. I went in and met with Lawrence and we talked and he said I needed to sign an form to finish processing my application through Capital One and before he walked off I told him I only wanted my credit ran by Capital One and no one else and he agreed.  Lawrence lied about only running my credit through Capital One. I later found out my credit was ran 8 different times. On 07/12/2014 I called Lawrence about my credit being ran 8 different times and he said I did not meet the requirements of income for Capital One and I stated to him, if that was so my credit still should not of been ran by other finance companies. Then he went on to say I will have to speak with Greg Monday morning about this situation.",2.0
7,"June 30, 2015","People always are complaining that when buying a new car you should be ready for a 3-4 hour ordeal. 
Not so, at least not for me at Streater-Smith Nissan.  When I bought my first Pathfinder it was less than an hour and a half, my second one, less than a hour.  Everyone was wonderful and my Sales Person Corey - knew what I was looking for, and delivered.  On top of that, he has done follow ups to be sure everything is going ok with the vehicle.  When I go in to get the oil changed he always makes it a point to say hello and ask if he can do anything for me.  
I would highly recommend them - and do!",5.0
8,"June 01, 2015"," don't think anyone could top the experience I had with Mike Faust! He was the most upfront & honest cars sells man I've ever had the honor of buying with, he made my wife so on top of the world with the car she picked, we went in for one thing and got a different car because he was so honest about what would be better for us, it definitely wasn't like he wanted us to spend money, he gave us the best deal for our budget, no other car dealership we visited made us feel so comfortable!",5.0
9,"May 16, 2015",I purchased my truck in late December 2014 the process was quick and the staff was pleasent. My problems started after I drove off the lot towards the end of January 2015 I called about my tags and plates. Was told they were not in yet I would get a call when they came in. I explained the sales man I was moving and needed them mailed to a differrnt city when they arrived. No problem I was told... Well the next two months I called and left messages with my sales man who never never returned my calls I used the Web page to make a request they tried to sell me another car??? The general manager emailed me to see if my on line reguest was being handled. I responded twice thst it was not and whst my issue was with out any reply. 4 months later I did reach my sales person came to the conclusion they were lost in the mail.. YOU THINK SO ? Was told I should go to the DPS and file for lost plates. Don't know why I was not told that 4 months earlier?,3.0
10,"April 07, 2015","This dealer is a great place to buy a Nissan. Went yesterday and even that didn't bought a car (i have bought 3 cars from them), the service was exceptional! Great people, great service. They tried to help you as long as they can to make a fair and decent deal.

11,"March 20, 2013","This dealership was happy to service my Maxima after an accident. They made the experience as painless as possible and explained in detail the work to be done, as well as the detailed results of the final alignment. The sales and service staff always greet me with a happy hello, and ask me how I've been. It really makes you feel like you belong to a family. I would recommend this dealer to anyone!",5.0

13,"August 04, 2012","This is the second time we have bought from Streater-Smith Nissan. The staff is friendly and easy to work with. Truly have the customer in mind and not the bottom dollar. Corey Taylor has been the greatest salesman to work with. He understands what the consumer wants and doesn't use smoke and mirrors. Straight forward and to the point. A little bit of back and forth, but a great experience.
The service department is a pleasure to work with. The first Nissan we had never seemed to be fixed right from 2 different dealers. We brought it to Streater-Smith, and never had another issue. Do to that experience, we have bought the last two Nissan Altimas from them. Can't give them enough praise. A dealership like this is few and far between.",5.0
14,"July 02, 2012","Recently I received a survey rating the delearship, service and sales personnel. I filled out the survey but upon realizing the mistakes I made in answering this survey, I would like to give my own description and in my own words how I felt about our experience at Streater-Smith Nissan. The dealership was both extremely clean and very friendly. I was treated with kindness and with expertice. My salesman, Corey Taylor went beyond my expectations in helping me with the process of learning my car in its fullest. I even had a problem with the bluetooth and he spent a great deal of time with me explaining the ins and outs of the system. I'm sorry for the misrepresentation I gave because it was not how I felt. So far everyting is GREAT with both my salesman and the dealership. Melissa Mitchell",5.0
