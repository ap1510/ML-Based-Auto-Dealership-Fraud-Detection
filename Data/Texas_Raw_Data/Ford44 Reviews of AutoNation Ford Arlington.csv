0,"May 28, 2020","I am new to the area and called about getting my recall fixed. I was told my recall had expired and would have to pay to get my car fixed. Recalls don't expire.....this is bad business, trying to con people into paying to get their recalls fixed. Will never recommend this place to anyone!",1.0

2,"November 10, 2018",We came in to get a recall done on our mustang we strolled through the used cars and found a Fusion that we liked. Wifes Mustang came from this dealership back in 2006 when it was Texan Ford. So ours was 12 years old 177000 miles. It was time. Our sales person Mike Halasa was awesome. He was not the pushy salesman that we have had in the past at other dealerships. He made it a awesome time. He found some trim pieces broken and is having them replaced along with window tint. Now our finance person Kim Harris was the best. Made signing the papers fun. Very helpful and very good at her job explaining all the warranties and all other questions. She gave me a nickname as serial trader  since I have had the 5 new cars since my wife has had one. She had me laughing and enjoying our time. This is how car buying should be. Got our payments where we wanted. AWESOME DEALERSHIP!!!!!!! As we were about to leave the check engine light came on. No worries they said. Put us in a loaner until it can get fixed. Very impressed how we were treated. Thank you Autonation Ford Arlington,5.0
3,"August 01, 2018","HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!  I just called to schedule an appointment and the guy asked me if I was a customer there.  I said yes and he asked for my phone number.  I then said I wasn't sure if I had been there before and he cut me off and said ""I need your phone number...I need your phone number ma'am!""  I immediately told him that was not a good way to start earning my business and asked to speak with his supervisor!  He hung up on me.  I called back and a guy named Paul Barnum answered and defended him..for all I know it could have been Paul I spoke with the first time...but I won't be going there for service!",1.0
4,"February 01, 2018","I attempted to buy a truck here, the sales guy tried to argue with me and tell me a rear locker was the same as 4x4. Then they offered me an insulting price for my trade well below what other dealers had offered. When I asked for my key so I could leave the salesman left and came back with a manager and no key like they were holding me hostage, Would NOT recommend.",1.0

7,"January 18, 2017",Great experience at the Ford dealership service department in Arlington. Very efficient and thorough with covering our service needs and getting it done within the timeline requested. Everyone there was very professional in their assistance.  This the kind of service at a dealership that you continue with. Great job everyone.,5.0

9,"December 01, 2016",Steve Belcher was very personable. He listened to what I wanted and made did what he could to meet those needs. Robert did a great job securing my loan and getting me a payment I was comfortable with as well as all the add ons for a worry free next few years. My car buying experience here was wonderful. ,5.0
10,"November 22, 2016",Canceled GAP & Tire & Wheel due to totaled 2016 Mustang originally through SafeGuard (which don't buy any of the products...super headache with claims and cancellations) on 09/30/16. It is now approaching 2 months later and almost 11/30/16. My loan funded to pay for these items in 72 hours when I bought the car....but I cant seem to get a refund check after I bought the car approx. two months later....GAP company says canceled out and to pick up at dealer....Dealer claims they have no check....Now wont even respond.,1.0
11,"December 13, 2015","I have previously used this dealership for the maintenance on my 2014 Ford Fusion with no problems. However today's (12/12) service and attitude eradicated all of my previous experiences. From the time I entered the service department, I felt like ""who let you in and why"". I needed an oil change and rotation and a previous check engine light researched. I didn't think that I needed the engine code reviewed as the light had gone off but after speaking to Grand Prairie Ford they said to still have it looked at as the computer system would still retain the code and I am close to my 36K mileage. I knew that the service would take a long time and brought in a book to wait.

I have a maintenance warranty through MPP and was told by the woman working the service desk after being there for over an hour that they were closed and I would have to pay for the oil change. That sounded so strange to me as I brought my car in previously on Saturday's (even later than the current time of 11:45) and never had this issue. The woman became IRATE that I would challenge this assertion of them being closed. I called GPF and asked them and the service rep provided the phone number and stated that she had just gotten off the phone with them 5 minutes previously and that they did not close until 3PM. I took down the number for a live rep and the automated service they could use if this location actually sold MPP warranties.

I returned to the counter and stated that I called GPF and got the number and they had just gotten off the phone with them. She proceeded to get defensive and say ""who is THEY"". I also said that she provided this automated number that can be used if they sold the warranty. Again she huffed ""we dont sell them"" and tried to call them again. As I am watching I am saying to my self ""why is she punching in all these numbers"". At this point, i am finished as I don't stay places where I am treated in such a manner and asked that they just pull my car so I can go. She has someone pull the car around and then I proceed to call MPP myself from my cell phone. I was talking to a live rep within 30 seconds after selecting options #1 and #2.

But it doesn't stop there.... I then proceed to talk to the service manager who also had the demeanor of ""xxx does she want"" written all over his face. He proceeds to call MPP in the same manner that I did and immediately gets a rep on the phone to confirm coverage. Then this *** wants me to wait an additional 1-1.5 hours for an oil change. I just left. I will now take my car back to GPF for service. Their service reps tried to assist me with getting my service completed at ANOTHER Ford place whereas the people at AutoNation treated me like I dared to cross their threshold and expect quality service and respect.",1.0
12,"September 03, 2015","I was able to work quickly and efficiently with Greg on my 2016 Fusion purchase.  He was efficient and thorough (rare combo) and made it possible for me to take advantage of their great prices while passing through for business.  Greg had everything ready to go when I got there and really went above and beyond.  I was referred by a co-worker who has purchased 3 cars from Greg and his son, I can see why he keeps coming back.",5.0
13,"July 30, 2015","I got to this dealer at 6:30 with a dead battery in my new Mustang GT. They replaced free, no hassles and very quickly. I was out by 7pm. Very impressed and appreciative of their fantastic service. ",4.8
14,"May 24, 2015","Where do I begin, from the Management of Used Sales Dept, to the Finance Dept to the Service Dept poor service is what I received. I will never set foot on Autonation Arlington as long as I live nor will any of my family members.  Autonation Arlington aren't trustworthy bottom line. I suggest future customers do your homework and research before buying if not you've been warned",1.0
15,"May 09, 2015",Susan was a great advisor she helped me find out that I had purchased a maintenance package from Grand Praire Ford and they didn't give when I had maintenance done. She is top notch when coming to treating customers well. This is why my next vehicle purchase will be from here. ,5.0
16,"May 08, 2015",I brought my F250 in for service and I was very pleased to see women working on the QuickLane! Susan was very pleasant and I will return. Thanks!,5.0
17,"May 07, 2015",I came in because I needed tires. Susan Ragsdale was my service advisor and treated me like her own family. She helped me to get the best price since they price match their tires. The service was extremely fast and I would defiantly go back just to see Susan!,5.0
18,"May 05, 2015",Took my car in for oil change and routine maintenance and had great service! I was in and out faster than I was told it would take. They even washed my car!! ,5.0
19,"April 07, 2015","I WENT TO TEST DRIVE A FORD FUSION.  I WAS GREETED BY A GENTLMAN NAMED AKIM.  HE WAS VERY NICE AND TOOK ME TO MEET PAUL A, WHO I HAD RECIEVED AN EMAIL FROM FROM MY INTERNET SEARCHES.  PAUL ASKED ME 3 TIMES  IF I WANTED TO LOOK AT THE FORD FUSION ENERGY I KEPT TELLING HIM NO. THEN HE SAID WHY WOULD YOU NOT WANT 100 MGG?  RUDE....(BECAUSE I WANT A FORD FUSION)  AKIM TOOK ME ON THE TEST DRIVE AND WAS VERY NICE. WE CAME BACK AND AT ONE POINT I ASKED PAUL IF THE CAR WENT PAST 80 MPH (I HAD SEEN SOMETHING ON A VIDEO WAS NOT SURE OF) HE RESPONDED WITH WHY DO YOU WANT TO SPEED.  AGAIN RUDE....(I FOUND OUT FROM ANOTHER DEALER THAT YOU CAN CONTROL THE SPEED TO NOT GO PAST 80 AS A FEATURE FOR THE MY KEY).  HE GAVE ME A QUOTE WHICH WAS HIGHER THAN THE INTERNET PRICE.  HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO CALL ME BACK AND HE NEVER DID.  NEEDLESS TO SAY I WENT TO ANOTHER DEALERSHIP AND WAS GIVEN AWESOME CUSTOMER SERVICE AND PRICE.  I BOUGHT SOMEONE ELSE....",1.0
20,"April 06, 2015","Well i bought a new 2014 F150 and they were really nice until they get you to buy

21,"October 21, 2014",For the last 10yrs I have bought over 15 vehicles new and used. Always have had a great car buying experience! Customer service and follow up were perfect.,5.0
22,"October 18, 2014","My salesman was Michael M. He was nice and tried his best to solve situation. I bought an 2012 Ford Fusion SE and I'm happy so far with my purchase. Once I entered the Finance Dept with Chad, I felt I was taken fast. My interest rate went from 3.99 to 8.9% excuse per Ford Motor Credit but when I called them they said dealer could have negotiated.  It was obvious commission was the only thing that mattered.  While I'm signing papers my salesman Michael M. was removing all of my personal items from my 2006 Dodge Durango that I traded in. At the time I was so ready to leave I was a little relieved he did it but still skeptical. 5 days later I noticed I didn't have my GPS out of my truck. I called him because I knew EXACTLY where it was in the compartment. I drove up there, the truck was still there cleaned out but NO GPS. I was furious. Michael then bought 2 Managers, I assume out there and they basically said suck it up we don't have it and that they would check  with clean up people and let me know on Monday. Seriously, they couldn't take care of now while I'm there.  I was in tears. I just bought a car, gave you commission and they could careless that they have a thief working for them. For this experience, I cannot will not recommend their dealership again. I'm still researching legal steps. ",1.8
23,"August 27, 2014","Dropped my Escape off for routine maintenance, a couple of recalls, and a handle had come off on the back hatch door. Requested a quote for a deep scratch as well. Tim took care of everything and more! He walked me through the work that was done, and three options for the scratch. He even washed and detailed the car, inside and out. We are moving out of Arlington but I will continue to bring my Escape back to them!",5.0
24,"July 21, 2014","Finance guy was rude and smug.   Would not give a fair blue book value for my trade even though it was purchased at one of the Autonation chains, had extremely low miles and not a scratch or blemish on it.   Was looking to upgrade to a vehicle found at another AutoNation not available locally but internet price was not honored either after tacking on additional charges , window tint etc. which was not listed under the discounted price.  Payment price he came up with was $41.00 per month higher than I was able to get for the same car at same discounted price at another dealer.  Would have liked to keep my business with AutoNation but will never go back or recommend them to anyone.  ",1.5
25,"March 13, 2014","Our Ford Flex overheated in traffic recently . It was towed to this dealership. The following day they got to it after 4pm..they diagnosed a water pump leak and quoted us $2500 to fix it!!!  We picked up and took it to Bird Kultgen Ford in Waco, TX. They diagnosed the fan and motor assembly. They fixed it for $800. The water pump was fine. Our Flex is back on the road. I strongly encourage you to get a second opinion if this service center has ""diagnosed"" your car. Plus, they are WAY over-priced on their quotes. Even it was a water pump, the highest quote I got out of 3 outside quotes was $1300!  ",1.4
26,"December 29, 2013","No customer service once you drive off the lot.  I purchased a 2013 F150 King Ranch and moved the next day.  It took me 4 phones calls over the course of several weeks to just get me tags---and, my temp tags expired.  Additionally, the dealer installed locking lugs without a KEY!  I had to have the truck serviced for a recall when I discovered the problem.  It cost me $75.00 to have the lugs forcibly removed and new ones installed.  Autonation refused to reimburse me for the cost.  I know it isn't that much, but to me it is a matter of principle.  Autonation made the mistake and wouldn't remedy it. Beware of this dealership and Andy Pham, Internet salesmen. ",3.0
27,"December 07, 2013","We were traveling back to Missouri, the screws in our starter needed to be replaced. (2 screws) cost of 636.00 to get out of their! Charged for things could not have been done, because the vehicle would not start to do such a test!!  I feel that since we had to have service, we we're taken advantage of.  I wrote a letter to the customer service reprehensive, Linda Belota,  have NEVER gotten an answer. (twice contacted) I was warn about this Ford dealership, should have listened.  BEWARE!",1.6
28,"November 21, 2013","This Dealership is Awful.the first day i went there just to test drive a ford focus and they pressured me to buy a car when i said i was just looking for now and needed to decide what kind of car i was going to get... They brought in two different managers to pressure me into getting a car. My boyfriend finally had to say we are going to need her keys back now. I should have stayed away but i thought i would give them the benefit of the doubt. The entire time i dealt with Leon Williams. Stay far away from this guy... He  called me the next day and asked if i had decided on a car. I let him know i was interested in the car i test drove. The Car was 16,500 asking price.I told him I wanted to get the car TTL for 14,000. And 4,000 for my trade in. He called back twice and i didn't answer. So he TEXTED me. Which i found to be unprofessional, but i went with it. He told me he would do 14,089 for the car and 4,000 for my trade in. I then said If you make it 14,000 even and 4,000 for my trade in I will be there in 20 minutes. He said ""I owe him lunch for that"" but it was a deal. I Got my father to drive down so he could be there to make sure everything went as planned. I got there signed so papers (was not shown the breakdown of the price) He took me to the finance office where i filled out paper work THEN was shown my breakdown.. WELL He had the Price HIGHER THAN THE ASKING PRICE  and 4,000 dollars deducted on the CRAZY HIGH price of this car for my trade in. So i would get the car  for 14,000 even. That would make the 16,500 asking price JUMP to 17,500 at least (not including TTL). how is that a deal for me..? and Leon why would i have to buy you lunch for you screwing me over. I told the manger that was not what we discussed and I had Text messaged to prove it. He simply said i'm sorry but I cant do that deal. So I walked out and told Leon to give me my keys and that  he lied to me. All he could say is I dont know what you are talking about. This by far is the WORST car buying experience i have ever encountered. The Finance guy who was nice pretty much  said that Leon knew what he was doing and that was why i had not been shown the papers from the beginning. I will say that i have learned my lesson.  ",1.0

31,"April 13, 2013","My car was totaled out by my husband ,this omen was a sign to return to my Ford roots.
 This experience was all around excellent for my first internet try at buying a new car.
Ms Angel Gibson got the exact style ,color and make and delivered it right to the front door.
 This was the first time I ever bought a new car that I didn't have to sit around 5/6 hrs. where they keep running back and fourth to the sales manager,even though Andy was very helpful with the sale. I had no trade in no money down no nothing!....Andy says ""No Problem"".
 I left a dealership 2 miles from my house because they gave me a bad vibe and did not make me feel happy about the 30,000$ I was spending.
  I hope to bring in my 78 Y.O mom for a new Focus upgrade in the future.
Thanks for staying late for me and my new car needs. ",5.0

34,"January 14, 2013","This is my second auto purchase from Bankston. I was referred to Greg Plechus who I found to be friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. Greg was a good listener and we quickly determined the specs of the vehicle I wanted. Greg stayed focused and we made a deal with a none of the usual BS that usually accompanies a car purchase. Count me as a satisfied Bankston customer.",5.0

36,"November 28, 2012","As I consider what to write in this review, I must first say I am surprised to see any negative comments posted by Bankston Ford of Arlington customers. I purchased a 2013 Explorer XLT on Black Friday. My initial contact with this dealership was earlier the same week, when I submitted an online request. Not only did someone reply immediately by email (my desired method of communication), but I received a friendly phone call as well. Eventually, I made contact with Sales Representative Greg Plechus, who suggested I make a quick visit to see whether he could beat the deal I was making with another Ford dealership.

Upon arriving to Bankston in Arlington, I was greeted immediately by Greg Plechus. Presenting myself as a ""no BS"" kind of person, Mr. Plechus acknowledged he was similar and assured me that he would conduct all of our business in a straightforward and professional manner. He has certainly upheld his promise in every way. Following our introduction, Mr. Plechus invited me to speak directly to the person responsible for appraising my trade-in, which I did, and as a result, the trade-in allowance was significantly more than the ""best possible deal"" offered by the competitor dealership.

I spent a considerable amount of time in Mr. Plechus' office as we looked online at available Explorers and discussed features and options. Never for one moment did I feel pressured or coerced like he was attempting to talk me into accepting something I did not want. In fact, before even visiting the sales lot to check out the Explorers, Mr. Plechus listened to my desires and priorities and worked diligently to find a vehicle that met all of my demands.

Mr. Plechus and everyone on the sales and finance teams at Bankston Arlington are down-to-earth people who truly enjoy working with customers. They delivered exactly what I wanted and did so without any attempts to oversell, deceive, or otherwise mislead me in any way. After the sale, I worked with the aftermarket team to get window tinting. Mr. Plechus has followed up with me on more than one occasion over the past five days to ensure I am satisfied. We have spent additional time inside the Explorer so that he could teach me how to use the new Ford Sync software and assist me in maximizing my driving experience.

In the future, I know that I can depend on Mr. Plechus to assist me in any way. This was a truly enjoyable experience, which I must say, is unexpected and atypical. I am a proud Explorer driver, and I will encourage my friends and family to deal with Bankston Ford of Arlington.",5.0
37,"November 09, 2012","We had not purchased a vehicle in several years and our need was great.  We were given the keys to a wonderful car from a wonderful team. Greg Plechus found us the car we were looking for and made our buying experience the best we have ever had.  Very thankful for Robert, sorry I don't remember his last name, he made  financing the car easy with a good interest rate. We recommended Bankston and Greg to our family and they purchased a vehicle the following day.  Great experience for all.

38,"June 19, 2012","I had told David that I was not a fan of dealerships. He told me he was an easy person to work with and that was no lie! I appreciate all his help and he got us into a car and paid off our old one. He listened to what we needed and worked with us. I may not be totally swayed on all dealerships, but Bankston Ford took care of us!",5.0
39,"May 29, 2012","I was trying to purchase a used vehicle and was working with David Burford.  We agreed on a price and I left to go get the bank financing and sign the papers.  I called back within an hour and Mr. Burford would not take my call.  I called numerous times and had the financing complete with a bank draft in hand.  My wife finally called on another line and Mr. Burford immediately answered the phone.  I was told that while I was in the process of signing papers that they sold the car to someone else.  WHAT A POOR WAY TO RUN A BUSINESS!  i WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS DEALERSHIP TO ANYONE!  Don't turn your back on them and definitely don't trust Mr. Burford!  If they felt that they were doing right they would have at least had the courage to answer my phone calls.  If they had been honest with me, they would have called or taken my calls to let me know. 

Again, WHAT A POOR WAY TO RUN A BUSINESS!!!!!

40,"May 07, 2012","I've bought a Ford Focus and Ford Edge from Scott at this dealership, and he will always be my first stop when shopping for cars (although I'm pretty well set for a while).

I picked my car up the next day, and unknown to me, the mechanic forgot to plug engine fan back in.  I ended up with an overheated engine out in Odessa, TX.  I was charged $104 for the repair, (Sewell Ford Odessa treated me right).  I called my Service Tech and said the mechinic in Odessa said the fan had not been plugged back in.  I said I wanted $104 and I also missed a day of work, but I would take just the $104.  He said they would send a check.  I called several times over the next 3 months and always the same thing, ""The check is on the way"".  Finally, after months of this,, I talked to the accounting dept. and found out the check had never been requested.  I finally received the check.  THEN, four months after I had the repair, I get a charge from Enterprise on my bank account.  I called them and they said Bankston never paid the invoice and now they were charging the rental to me.  I called Banston accounting and have not heard back.  I will NEVER go there again.",2.0

43,"January 07, 2012","I vowed 3 years ago to never step foot in this dealership again.  Thought I'd give it a try to see if new management had taken over.  Stayed 20 minutes which consisted of a guy that had no clue what inventory he had, so we just walked around the parking lot.  He couldn't find the right car - had to go back to the office twice and switch out keys and then blamed it on somebody else.  He gave us a stock quote as I walked out the door.

Left and went to Don Davis down the street and bought a better car for $6000 less!",1.4
