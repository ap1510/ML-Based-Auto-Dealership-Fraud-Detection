0,"June 27, 2020","I stopped by Port Lavaca Ford Service Department this morning to get an appointment and or see if a DEF sensor failure on my F250 could be repaired this morning. I walked in to the service department, the service associate said he’d be right with me. The phone rang and he answered it, talked for about 7 mins or so. About 2/3 of the way thru the first call another call came in. After finishing the first call of which came in after I came into the service department, he answered the 2nd call instead of seeing what I was there for. He talked on the 2nd call for about 5 mins or so and then started setting an appointment for the individual on the phone. It was clear to me that they do not care about their customers. I started to think that if another call was to come in that I’d bet that he’d take that one as well. I turned and walked out. This is the 4th time that I’ve had issues with this service department. Shame on me or the 3rd time and big time for this 4th try. I’ll be taking my truck to Victoria Ford from now on. Daniel",1.0
1,"December 14, 2018",I had a warranty issue with my ford truck. The truck was purchased at another dealer. They had to submit some info to Ford Motor company for review. I waited over 2 months calling them every couple of weeks. Finally found out the service manager was lying the whole time and did not want to help. Now is out of warranty and Ford says too bad for me now. Don`t get screwed over like I did.,1.0
2,"June 02, 2018","Took my 2015 F250 to them, under warranty, had issue with controls on steering wheel. Told them it was clock-spring failing. They troubleshot and said “no, it was the switches. 2 days later they called and said they had the part. I brought the truck in. They replaced the switch. Paid my deductible, drove truck 15 feet. Backed it up 10 feet to check repair. Wasn’t fixed. They didn’t even verify their repair. 5 hours of waiting here and still not repaired. May have to go buy the part and fix it myself.",1.0
3,"July 23, 2015","Bought a 2012 ford fusion back in 2014 from ptlavaca ford had only 25,000 miles on it, about 2 days later we noticed the air conditioner blew hot air when on cold setting we told our salesman kevin henderson, he stated ""oh I have a fusion and what ever was on the last setting thats what it will be on when you turn it back on""! Really, ....well a year later it's doing it more and now that it's summer its miserable checked with the ptlavaca in victoria gave me a 400 plus rate for fixing it found out the fusions have this problem for a while its the sensor that are put on at the factory. My issue is my salesman new that it was not the settings they just didn't want to fix the problem and pass the buck because ford won't pay for their mistakes and that's because I still have warranty!",1.4
4,"July 31, 2014",I went to get my Ford F-150 checked out one morning and then kristen told me that my vehicle would be ready by the next day after i spent the WHOLE DAY waiting for it. I requested a rentar car and was told i couldnt Get one because my vehicle wasnt mechanically broken down. I called the next day and was told my vehicle wouldnt be ready until monday or tuesday. Which means i would not have a vehicle for a WHOLE WEEK. I again asked for a rental car and was told the same thing as the previous day and that if i wanted one that i had to pay out of pocket for it. I gave her the number to MasterTech Warranty so i could Get the rental car then i came to find out she never called them and she said she had and that they did not aprove for a rental car. I had a horrible experience here and i will not be coming again. I much rather drive an extra hour and a half to Get the right kind of Service i need,1.0
5,"June 02, 2011","The internet manager, Tara Gayle, is the whole reason I came to Port Lavaca Ford. She was wonderful and friendly and readily answered all the questions I had. I got to work with both Angel and Kevin, both of whom were wonderful, friendly, helpful, and it was the absolute best car buying experience I have ever had. I HATE buying cars, but this was a completely different experience and I send everyone I know there.",5.0
6,"February 21, 2011","I have owned BMW, Jaguar and Cadillac and none of those dealerships have treated me as well as Port Lavaca Ford. From sales to service I couldn't be happier or treated better. When my SUV had a safety recall, they contacted me before I had even heard about it to get my car fixed. They do care about their customers. ",5.0
7,"December 30, 2010","I will not recommend this dealership to anyone. We went there to buy a brand new vehicle and were told that we were approved,signed papers in financing and drove off in our new car. A week and a half later we get a call that the bank did not finance us after all and that they could not find a bank to finance the amount on the car or us. So we had no choice but to return the car back over. That was the most embarrissing moment I have been through considering we had showed off our new car and now left with nothing. Not to mention that I had to pay twice to my insurance company to add and remove this vehicle. They did everything wrong and will never go back there again much less recomend them. And thats because the company I work for was gonna go and see about buying some company trucks there but there loss I told my company what happened and they went to a different Ford dealership. Big mess up on Port Lavaca.",1.6
