0,"August 15, 2012","Excellent experience buying my new lotus. I ordered the car from the factory so the process was longer than a typical drive out purchase. Throughout the process Jeffrey worked hard to keep me informed of the progress. Once the car arrived, the pick up / purchase experience was excellent. Jeffrey and the dealer worked hard to go the extra mile to make the purchase memorable. Also great follow-up after the sale to make sure we were happy. I would definately look to purchase from Jeffrey and this dealer again.",5.0

2,"April 17, 2011","Very friendly sales person.  He found answers to questions I asked.  Good follow up, but not pushy.  I had technical questions, and got a call back from the staff mechanic who satisfactorily answered all my questions.  

The rest of this sentence is to fill the 250 character minimum.",4.8
