1,"April 14, 2019","Waited two and a half hours for a scheduled oil change (appointment). Technician left the oil cap off the engine, so I now have splattered oil under the hood, and no oil cap. In addition the bottom skid plate was not put back correctly and is  bent. On the bright side I had minimal oil loss, so things could have been much worse. I can't blame the service department for one persons mistake, but at this time cannot give a positive recommendation either. I will follow up with any corrective action the dealership may offer.",3.0

98,"November 01, 2016","In the day and age of computers and desensitized customer service, I feel that credit needs to be given when very much deserved.  Being a loyal Toyota customer for over 30 years there has been one constant. Dave Randall.  Time and time again Dave has gone above and beyond the typical ""Service Managers"" daily duties.  His genuine care for his customers show in his actions, words and ability to hold his personal and Toyotas standards way above par.  His team members and department are a direct reflection of his impeccable leadership skills.  It is a learned behavior and this behavior comes straight from Dave.  
Saying thank you doesn't seem quite enough. He is by far a top notch employee and should be recognized!
Thanks again!

I told Kris exactly what I wanted and needed to be as far as payments. I selected a specific Tacoma. Within a few short hours, Kris contacted me and told me that it was done and all that he needed was for me to approve the deal. It was amazing because I have been turned down by several dealers for various reasons including being upside down in my trade. You guys were able to give me a fair amount for my trade in without even seeing it in person. I was not able to get in until just before closing time. Kris and Justin were willing to stay late to ensure we were taken care of. I have never experienced such awesome customer service before. We will definitely be buying our next vehicle from you guys. Thanks ",5.0

128,"August 06, 2014","We recently purchased two vehicles from Gene Messer Toyota, and we had an excellent experience with the dealership (Teagan especially) on both counts.

The first car purchased was a 2014 Rav4 on a trade-in deal.  I had been contacted by another dealer in another city, but Gene Messer Toyota was able to find me the right vehicle for the right price, all in one day.  I was able to complete the process and negotiate the pricing through a very fair and open negotiation process.  As an added bonus, the car was a present for my husband on his birthday, so they even delivered the car with a big red bow and had everything ready for him to take delivery when I surprised him.

The second car purchased was a 2014 Corolla, also on a trade-in deal.  It was purchased less than a week later.  They had no more Corollas on the lot, so Teagan actually found one at another dealership nearby and brough it back for me to test drive and look into purchasing.  They were very patient with us during the negotiation process and were much more than fair in the pricing and the purchasing process.  It was an exceptional experience.  

The financing on both vehicles was also done through Toyota.  In both cases, we were able to complete the process without any problems.  Jessica Simpson was especially helpful during the first process, and she helped us complete everything quickly, seeing how we were trying to finalize the process before picking up our kids from daycare.  

Overall, it was an incredibly positive experience, and I would recommend Gene Messer Toyota to anyone looking for a new vehicle.",5.0

168,"November 23, 2013","Sales experience, price and trade in value were good. Selection was OK. There was one option we didn't get that we wanted but due to the other good qualities at the dealership, we bought a new 4Runner from them. We arrived knowing what we wanted, what we expected to pay, an approximate value of our trade in and a interest rate quote from our bank. The salesman asked bout financing and we explained our credit score, the rate at our bank and said only if it could be matched would we finance with them. Much conversation back and forth with credit department and we were led to believe and expected the rate would be matched. Jessica came out and led us back to a cubical to finalize the sale. A lot of our time was wasted marketing add-ons we didn't want. We still had a 1 1/2 hour drive home ahead of us. Finally in exasperation I asked; ""Are we wasting time or are waiting for approval?"" Jessica told us she just had to get all sales and add-ons finalized before signing. She then informed us that we had been approved for an interest rate that was almost twice as high as what we expected. We were speechless. I asked her what she thought she was supposed to be doing and she replied, ""We knew you didn't want your credit report needlessly reflecting numerous credit checks, so we went with Toyota Motor Credit because we like to deal with them."" It was then I calmly explained that I knew what Toyota Credit had and she didn't need to waste a credit check for something I already knew. I asked my wife if this is what we were expecting and she reaffirmed that we were expecting a rate of 2.9%. I excused my self and went and called my bank. When I returned Jessica was gone but came back with a rate quote of 2.7%. It appeared to us and we definitely felt like Gene Messer Toyota was trying to manipulate and scam us into accepting a higher rate solely for their financial gain. Things only got worse. We proceeded to document signing. She requested we sign on an electronic signature pad. After the second signature I asked, ""Shouldn't we be going over and seeing these documents?' She assured us she would print them in a minute which she did and with pride announced ""Here is what you signed!' When I confronted her with the fact that the odometer statement was inaccurate and had a bogus mileage figure on it, she replied, ""Oh, that just means we didn't alter it, it doesn't have to be accurate.""

We drove home and for 90miles discussed how we had been treated. The finance department seems to be lacking in integrity. I cannot recommend a business to others if it cannot treat customers respectfully and properly fill out financial documents. We left wishing we had dealt with our local dealer. The finance department shames the whole process.",3.0
169,"August 02, 2004",I bought a used Toyota Corolla and the over all experience was rather pleasant.  I received a fair trade for my Ford Taurus and paid a resonable price for the Toyota.  My only issues are the Finance guy was rather rude and pushy about his extra insurence and extended warranty as I already had financing arranged through the local credit union.  I also became a little frustrated with Luke who was on his cell phone a great deal of the time working on other deals.,3.5
170,"November 14, 2003",I purchased a new Land Cruiser in January 2003.  The truck has been just plain awfull!!  I had it in their shop for problems with creaks and rattles since the first week I owned it.  They kept my car in the shop for over 4 months for the first 8 months I owned the car.  Their service department would repair one problem and then create 4 others.  Eventually they stated they could not fix my rattle in the windsheild and told me I would have to go to arbitration to get anything else done.  I DID THAT!  During the process I chose a different dealer in NM to help me.  During the process my problem was acknowledged and their service manager stated he could fix my problem.  I accepted the offer and it took MY NEW DEALER all of two hours to fix ther problem.  The factory had left a setting tab in the windshield.  They took it out and NO MORE RATTLE.  I was continually lied to at Gene Messer and would not recommend them to anyone.,1.3
