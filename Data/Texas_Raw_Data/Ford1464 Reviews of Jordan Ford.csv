1,"March 13, 2020","I have dealt with Adrian Logan over the years and I will never go to anyone else to service my Explorer. I bought it from Jordan because I trust that they will take care of my car when they have it and not try to sell me things I don't need as well as tell me the stuff that is important. Adrian has been there for years and I think that says a lot about the company. Thank you for always taking care of us.

12,"August 12, 2019",Purchased a 2018 F150. Price was average from what I could find on the internet. After the sale I discovered that the STX versions didn't have the trailer brake fuse installed for some reason. I had to make the service department aware of the issue. I was not contacted about the permanent license plates. I had to call and find out how to get them. Which was for me to drive there and retrieve them./ No offer to mount them. And now the bills for toll road use since they didn't remove the plate from my trade in and used the car. They won't see any more business from me.,2.6
13,"August 07, 2019","Purchased our 2nd Ford Edge and worked with Julian DeLaRosa both times.  We told him exactly what we wanted and he delivered right in our price range.  We love our new Edge!  Julian made both buying experiences very pleasant and Rady Deais was wonderful through all the paperwork.  Thank you Jordan Ford, Julian, & Rady for a great buying experience!",5.0
14,"July 16, 2019","I've been searching for a 2019 Ford Edge in velvet burgundy with dune interior and all the features that I wanted (plus price) for a while now. Jordan Ford in San Antonio had this vehicle so I reached out to them via their website messenger to see if it was still available. I had just sent the message and Wally called me from Jordan Ford to talk about the Edge. He was very informative and explained that I could go to the website and use their Express Shop to get a quote. I was even able to put a deposit to hold it using credit card/debit and my down payment was also using card. 
The Express Shop financing option is amazing! They let you enter your trade in information, run your credit, click all the discounts/rebates you could qualify for and they gave me a broken down quote.
When we got to Jordan Ford we met with Wally who set us up to work with Julian. Julian walked us through the buying process, showed us all the features that came with the Ford Edge. They looked at my trade in and actually quoted us for a little less than the online quote but they honored the online quote. Julian brought us back to financing and we worked with John who was funny and informative. When we finished with financing Julian had my new Ford Edge ready to go. 
Overall I would highly recommend Jordan Ford to anyone looking for straight forward purchasing of a vehicle. The online quote they gave me they stuck too and I even qualified for another rebate so it brought my price down. 
Thanks,
Wally, Julian and John for helping make my first new vehicle purchase the best!!",5.0
15,"July 15, 2019",I have a 2011 Ford Lariat F-150 with custom Tuscany Package. I was about to buy a new custom Ford in the next few months. That has now changed because my battery was bad and was told by Ford service adviser that it would take two or 3 days to change my battery out. This is my work truck and that is really pathetic it should take so long. The reason given was because they were so busy and a lot of people in front of me. I feel they should hire more help if that's the case. I am now shopping for a GMC or Dodge that has better service. I called the General Manager but he has not returned my call.,1.0

20,"May 28, 2019","Took my towncar to be diagnosed for a fuel system issue. After 3 days I was told it had a bad PCM. Falls diagnostic. Cost me $ 420.97 just for the false diagnostic. Overall I spent $ 900.00 to find out the problem was a bad connected at the fuel sending unit. The dealer told me I had a bad pump and computer. It was none of that. I had a young mechanic test out the entire fuel system and in a mater of 30 minutes he found the problem. Your service man Mr. Tom Williams, stated he had 30 years repairing Lincoln's I truly sought it. The dealer also recomended I purchase a computer from Computer exchange.com that it would be all set just to plug and run. Not so, the computer took 7 days to arrive and did not work as stated, the was $ 220.00 down the drain. Used the original computer which they claimed was bad. What a shame from a reputable dealership to perform false diagnostics and stiff the customer's. This warrants my money be returned. I sure hope the service manager contacts me. I want to hear from you.

21,"May 18, 2019","After going to three different dealerships and experiencing subpar service, long wait times, and being force-fed vehicles we weren't interested in, it was a blessing to work with Jordan Ford. Jeff Slaughter is great at his job and is very helpful, knowledgeable, and friendly. He was the only salesman we worked with who contacted me minutes after I inquired online about a vehicle, took as much information over the phone as possible, and stayed transparent through the entire process. The dedicated service my husband and I received from Jordan Ford has created a lifelong commitment to the Ford brand. We will ask for Jeff the next time we are in the market and will be recommending you all to our friends and family. Thank you for your help.",5.0

I could not be more pleased using Lee for the second time in six months. lee really knows his products, made sure I received all available discounts, and in detail went over all the features of my purchase.  As a handicapped veteran various options are essential and Lee carefully went through his inventory to find just what I was looking for at a great price.

26,"April 11, 2019","We were in the market for a new car for our college bound daughter. We told her we were going to see what the dealership could do for us. So of course she went online and started shopping and fell in love with the new Bohai Bay Mint color on the Fiesta. I contacted John and he went to work right away trying to find one in the mint color she wanted. In just a few short days we went from, ""hey can you find this for me"" to here is your daughter's new car. It was so fast we were able to surprise her with it. He made sure the visit at the dealership was flawless and fast. We did not have to wait for the usual 2-3 hours we have experienced with other dealership visits. Definitely sending anyone that asks me to John. ",5.0

28,"April 01, 2019","Recently, I purchased a vehicle from Jordan Ford. I shopped around for the specific car and trim for several weeks.  Looking everywhere from San Antonio to Austin and even beyond.  They had the best prices and when it was time to purchase, I decided to contact Jordan Ford.  Everything from the initial contact through the internet inquiry, to the first phone call was seemless.  I explained to John Castaneda and Julian De La Rosa exactly what I wanted and what I was looking for.  I didn't get pressured into other vehicles or get pressured into unneeded things that I didn't want or need.  They were honest and very thorough.  They explained to me all of the features and demonstrated how everything worked. My reps were awesome and I had a great experience.  When it's time to pick up another vehicle, I will definetly go to Jordan Ford.  Look for John C and Julian D, great team.  ",5.0

We told him our budget and he quickly showed us two great options.  Once we made a decision, Charlie Brown did a great job helping us to work out the deal.  It was also an added treat to see an old friend, Al, who took great care of our financing and extended warranty needs.  We are very pleased with our purchase and will definitely consider the wonderful team at Jordan for future purchases.",5.0
33,"March 20, 2019","Found the exact vehicle my wife and I were looking for online so I called Jordan ford and set up an appointment with John Castaneda. John was great. He worked with me on price, gave me solid amount for my trade in, and was nothing but super helpful, kind, and honest throughout the whole process. Even after we bought the car we notice a couple small things we wanted fixed. Without hesitation, John set up an appointment and gave us a car to drive while they worked on it and did everything we asked thoroughly. 

Highly recommend John Castaneda and Jordan Ford. We will be back for our next vehicle.

38,"March 02, 2019","Took my 2015 Explorer in for a couple of minor repairs and two recalls. Dropped the vehicle off on Wednesdayand to be fair I did not have an appointment. I was told they would try to get to it that day but should be able to fix it the day after no problem. No loaner car so I rented a vehicle. Called the next day but my car wasn’t ready. Called again THREE TIMES the day after and still wasn’t ready. Three days after dropping my car off they NEVER touched it. Was told a part was on back order but I never received a phone call, text, email or correspondence of any kind keeping me informed. They could have sent a letter to me in the amount of time they had my vehicle. In any event, I was in a rent car for three days on my dime. Money totally wasted. I was out my vehicle for three days. Time totally wasted. And at the end of the day they accomplished absolutely NOTHING in my car. Horrible service. Horrible communication. I’ve been doing business with Jordan Ford both personally as well as with my company with regards to service and new vehicle purchases but unfortunately that relationship evaporated this week. I will seek good service and new car purchases for my company elsewhere from now on. ",1.0

40,"February 27, 2019","Most of my experience was taken care of via phone and email. I do not have a lot of time to go sit in a dealership for the entire day, and my salesman (John Castaneda) did all of the leg work before I even went in. I was in the dealership a total of 1.5 hours and it was only this long because of stuff on my end. This is my 4th purchase from Jordan Ford and I plan on giving them my future business. ",5.0
41,"February 27, 2019","On 02/14/2019 I took my 2016 Expedition to Jordan Ford to repair the Rear Mode Actuator and excessive wind noise coming for the doors, this was the second time I had it to them for wind noise fix. Friday I called for status on the car and I was told they were working on it and they would call when done. They never called I called them around 6:00 pm and was told it was not ready yet. I called Saturday at 3:00 pm and was told they were still working on the car and would not be ready until Monday. Monday I called and the said they were still working on the car and would not be ready until Tuesday. Tuesday I called and they said they were working on the car. So I called the sevice manager he said he would check on status and later returned my call and said it was ready. 
We went to pickup the car up and the wife drove it home. Next day I had to fly to Dallas until yesterday Febuary 26, 2019. I got in the Expedition for the first time and the wind noise was louder than my 1965 Frod Mustang Convertible. Jordan Ford has needs to work on their Quality Control and customer service . I bought the Expedition at Jordan Ford and think I should receive respectable service for a $63,000 vehicle. ",2.0

You ask him anything about his products and he can give you real info.  Not speak what comes to mind.  He will show you, demonstrate and point things out.  The dealership understands customer service is important.  I have been going there for a long time because they remember my name and treat us very well.  They treat you like a neighbor not a mark.  I have bought nine vehicles from this dealer and all but 1 from Cody.  The service is great and everyone is approachable for discussion, light or serious.  Even Marc Cross the guy on TV.

75,"December 22, 2018","I will never buy or have have anymore work done by jordan ford. I took my 13 f150 to have it diagnosed and was told it's the lead frame solenoid. First problem was that a lead frame solenoid is non existent. Lead frame yes, but solenoid is a definitive no. It contacts solenoids but isn't one.  Advisor said,""its an electronic so its a solenoid(dont remember service ""advisors""name.  Haha. Other advisor Tracy Keller said it requires a trans drop to perform repair, also bogus information. She also said she couldn't get a parts list for us when she quoted a parts price.  Yeah that's bs too. I made the repair in less than 4 hours without dropping the transmission with a quick parts list pulled up by Ancira Ford parts department in Floresville Texas with nothing but a phone call. Do not ever buy anything from these thiefs as they don't know what they're talking about nor do they know how to advise on a common repair on a transmission that's given them problems since day one of release of the transmission. Furthermore, I drive a Chevrolet Camaro and was asked if I was aware of where I was, indicating thier discomfort in my choice of vehicle. If zero stars was an option I would definitely give it.

92,"December 04, 2018","Coming to Jordan Ford was a very pleasant experience. From the moment we stepped onto the lot, PJ, our sales rep greeted us and took us straight to our future 4Runner with no sales pressure whatsoever. From there he took my wife out on a test drive while I waited with our three year old in the Lobby. After that I took the 4Runner out myself with PJ. Not once was he pushy. He waited till we were done with our test drive. We explained the situation that we were not ready to buy that day and he understood completely. We walked away with a sales purchase order that was good for 5 days after saving us even more money from the asking price. I expressed that the 4Runner had a strange smell in the interior and so they detailed it and shampooed the entire thing. After we got approval on loan he drove 40 minutes to our place of business to deliver paperwork so we wouldn't have to come into the dealership. After that, he advised that the truck was clean but needed to air out for at least a day due to concerns of any leftover fumes from the cleaning treatment. On delivery day, he drove from San Antonio to San Marcos so we wouldn't have to travel all the way down to him. PJ treated us like family and for that we are grateful. We will definitely be buying from them again. Can't say we've had better service anywhere else! Thank you PJ

260,"August 05, 2018","I got a high recommendation from a trusted 
Source to deal with Jerry Daniell . Jerry 
Continually sells to the husband , his wife 
And their kids . That saids something right 
there about the trust between the salesman 
and his Client . The truck I bought was a Ford 
certified preowned .  The truck , I could tell , 
was taken well care of by the previous owner ; 
not a scratch on it , low mileage . I called Jerry
 the night before and told him I was interested in seeing it. He texted me back later that night , I’m sure 
from home , and said he’d take care of it. When 
I got there the next morning , Jerry had it out 
front looking all gourgous as if ready for the Prom. He checked it out himself and told me I was getting a heck of a lot more truck than what they were asking for . They worked with me that same day and I was driving “ Pegasus “ home in no time flat . Thank you 
Jerry and thank you Ford for putting me back in
a Ford truck again . You never know what you got
until you lose one . I , LITERALLY, talk to men EVERY day who say “ man I wish I hadn’t have sold my Ford truck .” Well , there you have , the fairy tale where the man , at the end , gets the truck AND ..... it’s a FORD too . “ Who’s ready to go camping ??? “

I shopped every big dealership in San Antonio and the smaller ones in the surrounding areas. No place treated us like they did at Jordan Ford. Nothing is more frustrating than driving 75 miles from home to look at a vehicle that is advertised at one price only to get there and its not the same vehicle. I had a very specific number in mind for our budget and Lee Efting did his very best to get to that number. He kept in constant touch with us during the process making sure anything he could do to get us in the vehicle was done. I will say this, usually when I get a new vehicle home I remove any of the dealership advertisements right away. I have no problem leaving my Jordan Ford license plate trim in place. They really took care of us.

Jerry was responding to questions before he was at work, then he and Dan Aragon introduced us to Charlie Brown. After learning more about what we needed Dan showed us such great trucks, it was hard to choose! These folks are amazing! They answered tons of questions, negotiated a great price on a certified preowned Ford F350 Super Duty King Ranch that came with factory 5th wheel and towing packages. This truck looked almost new, new tires all around, and they ordered/installed gratis  parts requested. Also, because we're new to pulling a 5th wheel,  they said to take the truck to a 5th wheel hitch expert at a nearby RV Store, to get answers to any/all questions. After we decided to go for it, Cinnamon did s terrific job with the documentation. With a maxed-out credit score, our credit union had given us a very favorable loan and pre approved check. But Jordan Ford somehow found an even lower rate.  Cinnamon was very patient when we read every word of every document, and she did a great, no pressure, job helping us explore maintenance options. Because it was getting dark, we asked if we could come back for a class on the truck, to learn all the options. Dan and Jerry spent a spent a couple of hours with us,  again,  answering a ton of questions. These people love what they are doing, getting folks in their dream vehicle!

I live approximately 150 miles from the dealership and have access to many other dealers near me but never get treated the same. The biggest part of this is my sales professional Lee Efting who I communicate with via telephone as to my needs and price range and when I'm ready to look he always has what I want ready to go. That has been my experience with all of the sales team at Jordan but would highly recommend if you're looking into a new vehicle that you give Lee Efting a call. And he may use my name as a reference any time. I'm a retired military guy and he's always taken care of me. ,5.0

Lee went over the new truck's features in detail so we wouldn't miss a thing.  Turn around in this process was fast and painless.

He knew all about the bells and whistles that we asked about. And, he let us make our own sale.  

One minor complaint. We are both 80.  The sale took too long!  We loved the vet in Finance (I can't find his name) .  He was great, but that process was too long. the man selling us our floor mat....too long. Too long wait in between the different tasks we had to do.  Any way to speed that up?

Genuine, honest, likeable.  He didn’t assume anything, took the time to look for all the 3 vehicles that we came to look at.  In case you’ve never been to Jordan Ford on I-35, the parking lot where the vehicles are staged is MASSIVE!  Even drove us over to an off-site location where the truck we were most interested in was on display.  After having our truck appraised, Scott returned our keys, and let us know where he parked the truck.  The appraisal was a fair starting point for negotiations.  Overall great experience.  Car salesman around the city should be paying attention to the standards that this man has set. Definitely worth being mentored by him.  Scott goes above and beyond to make the buying experience a pleasurable one. 

The dealership was also great to work with.  After the numbers were settled on, the number cruncher actually found an additional $100 or so that we could save, and added it reducing the bottom line.  They were fair and honest with our trade-in.  The showroom, while busy, was clean and presentable.

He was friendly, responsive, and facilitated a mutually agreeable deal without the usual stress and anxiety. Ricardo came to my rescue, despite being very ""under the weather"", when my truck was broken into, damaging the driver-side lock, rendering the truck vulnerable to unlocked access. He introduced me to the right ""guy"" in service who replaced the lock immediately and at a very reasonable cost. I feel Jordan Ford gave me a good deal on my new truck and will stand behind me throughout its, hopefully, long life.

638,"November 14, 2017","We will start will the bad and end with the good couple of things though...
1. It is very upsetting that salesman are quick to judge a person because they look young. Yes I look like I am 18 but I am 25. I might be assuming my self but from a buyers purspective it makes you feel like crap. Multiple salesman saw me the moment I got to the dealer as I walked around and looked at trucks. It took about 10 min and 3 sales man to look at me and not say anything (looking from far away never tried to approach me.)
Until Steve came and acknowledge me. 
2. The second  thing that makes this not be perfect is that after making a choice on the truck I wanted I specifically explained to the salesman that I had gone to the bank  everything was good loan was approved and all they needed to do was fax the purchase order to them. I explained that what ever they did, to not run another loan application for Randolph brooks because I had everything ready to go. Sure enough couple days look at my credit report and show were Jordan Ford ran my credit again once I told the salesman not to. So now I have a extra hard credit inquire when it was not needed. 

The good...
Steve was great showed me couple options and went above and beyond to take care of me. I told Steve what I was looking for and quick found me multiple options. Even took me to a diffrent location were they had the truck I ended up purchasing. Steve the next day got the two trucks I was intrested  looking sharp since I had gone late the day before. We test drove both and made a decision. Steve was never pushy to wanting for me to purchase and was able to answer my questions quick on specs on both trucks. The day I went in to take the truck home with me it got there late and we were not able to submit the purchase order to Randolph so did not end up taking the truck home. To accommodate even tough it was not Steve fault he offered to loan us a new car for the meantime since I had been dropped off, which was awesome no charge no Hassel super easy I took a car and brought it back the next day. Steve made the paper work Part easy except the fact about my credit being run again was the only thing that bugged me. Other staff who help finalize paper work were not friendly and made it feel like they just wanted to get you out, except the young lady who offers the upgrades for your truck she was awesome don't remember her name. Steve also went above and beyond to get me the jack and spare tools the truck was missing 
As quick as possible and even had time to drop them off for me at my work. He made sure if I needed anything to not hesitate and call or text him at any time and he would do his best to take care of it. 

Over all experience was good. 
Would I go back and buy a car from Steve...? yes,  I will because he found me exactly what i wanted and how I asked him for it and acknowledge me from the beginning. Will I reminded him 20 times to make sure and not run my credit when not needed, I will!!!!

I had been searching online for a minivan for a few weeks and kept coming back to this one. I requested to be contacted by email and received a response within a few minutes from Julian De La Rosa. We corresponded for a few days. When I was finally able to go down to the dealership, I asked Julian if he could assure me the vehicle was still there, to which he did. I really appreciated it because I know that some places wont notify you if the vehicle is already sold. They would try to still get you down to the lot. I inform Julian of the date and time I was planning on arriving and he was there as promised. We took a look around the van, inside and out, under the hood, did a test drive, which ran beautifully, and then got down to business. There was a small issue that we brought up, to which he informed his manager Chuck Perry. They looked into the situation and assured us that if anything needed to be done to remedy it, they would take care of it. After we started the paperwork, we were introduced to Al Garcia, finance. He laid everything out on the table for us letting us know all our options. We did a little back and forth trying to compromise. After a few moments of my husband and I talking it over, we knew it was time to sign on the line. With this being our first time purchasing a vehicle, it was so much easier than I thought it would be. All our questions were answered, and we drove off feeling great about it.

790,"July 24, 2017",Great people to work with.  I usually do not like going to car dealerships because of all the high pressure sales people trying to sell you what they have on the lot.  There was none of that at Jordan Ford.  They showed us the car they had advertised and the price and let us make the decision on the purchase.   Steven and Al even stayed late to make sure everything was right with our purchase and we actually took the car home the same evening.  Thanks Jordan Ford for a great car buying experience.,5.0

What keeps me coming back to Jordan year after year? Answer: Mike Davis.
He is unlike anyone you will ever deal with. He will not forget you after the sale! When you deal with Mike, you get the entire package. Have a service issue with your vehicle? He won't just refer you to Service Department, he will make sure you are taken care of. He takes a real interest in you not just as a customer, but as a friend for life! Mike has supported my fundraising efforts each year for the American Diabetes Association with personal donations and ground support for our events. I can ALWAYS count on Mike!

He told Jesse we'd be looking at new Explorers & Escapes for me (Debbie Thompson.). He gave Jesse some specifics about what I wanted; interior type, etc. When we arrived we were told Jesse was off for the day. Another Sales person Alex said he could help but would call Jesse first. Alex reached Jesse and Alex told us Jesse had arranged for John Montfort to assist us. They're manager Mike, came over and introduced John to us and let us know that Jesse had a home emergency and was sorry, but John would take good care of us. John Monfort took excellent care of us!! Jesse had given John all the info on what I wanted. After test drives we were debating between the Explorer and Escape John asked if we had seen the Edge. Saw it, test drove it and bought it!!

803,"July 15, 2017","It took me over 3 months including all the web based research to decide on a new car. I visited 4 different dealers and of them all, Jordan Ford was hands down the best.  Julian De La Rosa had the cars I was considering lined up and ready to go so I didn't even have to wait for him to find them. He was the only one of all the dealers I visited that did that. Everyone at Jordan Ford was friendly, went the extra mile, and truly acted as a team to make sure we were comfortable. Drew McIver in financing made the normally drawn out paperwork process quick and easy. All that, was a huge difference compared to the 3rd dealer I visited. The salesman knew I was coming (I made an appointment), knew which car I wanted to see, and then had me stand outside in the hot Texas sun while he tried to find the car on the back lot and then took it get washed so I didn't have to look at a dirty car. I was very hot (pun intended) by the time he pulled the car up for me to see. What a difference from Jordan Ford. It was the attention to detail that got me to buy from them versus one the other cars I narrowed our search to. Julian also allowed us to drive two different cars home so our aging mother could try getting in an out of them and didn't have to spend the day with us at the dealership. This was extremely important to us since she has a hard time getting into some types of cars at her age. Thanks to Julian we are driving a new car we love and that works well for the entire family!

Chuck has always been very professional and listens to our wants and needs and never tries to oversell beyond our needs.

He has also helped our daughter purchase her first truck and she is extremely happy and recommends Chuck to her friends.

827,"July 07, 2017","I am pretty sure that most people do not really look forward to having to visit an automobile dealership to purchase a new vehicle.  Certainly it is not on my bucket list.  However, on July the 3rd, 2017 we decided that it was time to shop for a replacement for my 2012 F-250 Super Duty KR Powerstroke which had close to 200,000 miles on it.  We did our research online before arriving at Jordan Ford and we were immediately met by Sales Representative Steve Meeker.  He introduced him self and then went about finding the keys to the truck in question and made it available to us for inspection.  He then took the time to show us all of the new items on these trucks.  He worked some numbers for us and then we left the dealership for several hours.  When I returned I decided to have them give me a price for the 2012 F-250 as a trade in.  This is something I never do and that is trade in a vehicle to the dealer.  However, to my surprise, Jordan gave me what I considered a very fair price.  We then went about working the formal deal.  During this process Steve introduced me to the Service Manager, Bud King.  As the deal progressed I was taken to meet a Finance Manager by the name of Ken Kloesel and I found him to be most enjoyable and not pushy at all.  Generally, I abhor meeting the Finance Manager part of any car deal.  While in Ken's office the owner, Marc Cross, came in and it seems we share similar taste in wristwatches.  Along the way we met an Accessory Sales fellow by the name of Charles Culp.  I should point out to get me the pickup that I really wanted they had to search for one and had it delivered all of the way from Anson, Texas.  After several days of getting it prepared we picked it up on 7-7-17 and Steve had it sitting ready and parked right under the canopy by the front doors to the dealership.  At that time I was introduced to the Accessory Manager, Rhonda Saylor.  So, I met plenty of people and they were all attentive to my needs.  Steve Meeker went above and beyond to make things right.  I have appreciated all of that.  This is the second vehicle that I have purchased from Jordan Ford.  I have long been a Service Department customer of theirs.  In summation, I am very please with Steve Meeker and his work with this sale.  ",4.8

1117,"May 31, 2017","I found myself back in the car market when my 06 Mazda 3 Hatch, basically a Focus lost the motor.

Casey explained Certified cars which I knew nothing about.  He sold me on cars in that program.

We test drove a fire engine red '14 bit mileage was higher than I was looking for so I decided to keep looking.

Keeping an eye on Jordon's inventory, I saw the Ruby Red hatch, 22,000 miles, finished out exactly the way I wanted it.

Set an appointment through the website and it assigned Danny as my contact.  I felt bad Casey wasn't included.  I reached out to Casey and Danny and they were very accommodating to that end.

Casey had another issue working so I really worked with Danny on the '16.

As long as there wasn't a vibration or the Focus didn't veir into oncoming trsffic, I was going to buy it.

I had researched hundreds of Focus in a 100 mile radius.  I knew the market as well as anyone.  

I had also test drove 4 additional cars but they didn't have any goodies like yours.  17"" Black wheels, moonroof, leather, blood red.  It popped like the white, black or silver ones would NEVER compete with.

So Jordon, when looking for inventory, don't be afraid to get the baddest car in that segment.  Saying no to white, cloth interior is really easy.

Danny met with me and got to know my ""story"".  

Oh, also, Jordon, if you have sway with Ford engineering, tell them to mate the manual tranny to the non-turbo offerings.  

Danny introduced the Focus and went around, 360, opened all doors, hatch and hood.  Discussed features and appointments.  He was the only sales guy that did that.   

When he started, he drove with the manual shift option and showed me how that worked.

Danny was the only sales guy who did this.  Very interesting now I think of it, because every dealer I met, I asked for a manual transmission as my #1 option in the non-turbo Focus hatch.

But Danny remembered and started the drive demonstrating that feature.  

I was sold.  

Yep, I knew I wanted this one.  So I was probably the easiest close available.  He reiterated what Casey said about Certified vehicles.  DUN...

Assumption close - let's write this up is all he had to use.

I did make one adjustment to the numbers but quick fix and on to accessories and finance.  

I skipped the additions and then waited for Joe Kelly in Finance.

Joe was a class act, too.

I work at a bank so had my own financing.  So Joe didn't have any incentives in my deal.  I felt bad, but my resource at the bank sends a lot of referrals so I was locked into using her, if you know referral business.

Danny stuck with me as I moved thru closing.

The car was out of make-ready and Danny sinqued my phones for me and helped set the radio stations.  You can tell he has done this a couple times.

I will definitely refer Danny to any and everyone I know who is looking for a ride.  

Casey convinced me that certified was the way to go.   Without Casey, I never would have looked twice at Certified offerings.

Danny is a top notch salesman.  You are extremely fortunate to have him on your team.

I do have a concern with make-ready.  When I got home, it ain't yours til you wax it.  The finish on the car was horrible.  

No reflection on Danny.  Danny is a bad-ass.  Danny's an 11.

The water spots were very deep into the paint and cooked in.  There were too many scratches to count,  hundreds all over the car.

A one year old car with low mileage and certified.  That should have been buffed out.

I tried wax and it did nothing.  So I compounded, used a course cleaner wax, then high gloss wax and the finish is almost new again.  But make ready should have done the work I did fixing the finish.  

It looks amazing and I've had two people, strangers, ask what color that is.   Looks bad to the bone and is very mirror-like.

That's the only gripe.  Make-ready turned it out really quickly, but getting it the next day, buffed out, would have been preferred.  

When I buffed it out, the finish didn't pop untIL I applied my three step process.  If the finish needs extra work, then extra work should be taken.  

I got it done so no harm, no foul.  Jordon is a great dealership that I will always recommend.    Ordered my '99 F150 at Jordon and pops used the same salesman, the brother of our favorite neighbor.  So I'm a repeat customer.  10 years and I'll be looking again.  Hahaha.

1165,"May 19, 2017","Personally, it took a while for my family to trade in our truck because of finances and getting a new job, to afford another car payment. But, once we did go back to Mario (the only salesman you should buy from, period) at Jordan Ford to get the process started, someone was willing to pay more for our old beat-up truck than we anticipated. We got such a better deal overall because of the hard work Mario dedicated to giving us the best deal they can offer. We have very good credit scores but usually at dealerships, it doesn't mean they will give you the deal you deserve. Mario made sure to consult all of the Finance Managers to ensure we can get the best interest rate along with the appropriate services needed so we don't overpay on insurance for our car. Patience, compassion, tactfulness, tailored service to our needs, are his best virtues. 
The same week, we decided to trade in our other car because he proved how we were overpaying on our other car and could get a new model with 0% interest rate. Considering how good our credit scores were, it was amazing how we have two car payments now and got better car insurance for less than double the price of what we were paying for our family car. It's worth the time to find out what your options are and how you can get the best deal for the money you work so hard for, if you have a few hours during the week. A lot of salesmen are pushy, don't care about you, and are looking for a quick payday. But Mario wants the best for you and will show you how Ford cars can exceed your driving needs.

1211,"May 10, 2017"," My wife and I had bought a new vehicle from Ted about three years ago. Due to some unforeseen circumstances we had to upgrade to a larger vehicle. Ted went above and beyond for us in the past with our past vehicle purchase so I didn't hesitate in calling him when it came time to purchase our next vehicle. My wife and I went up to the dealership on 5/3/17 around 5:30pm and contacted Ted. We told him exactly what we were looking for and wanted to make sure our two car seats would work with the vehicle we were looking at. Ted ensured us that they would but insisted he bring a similar vehicle down so we could put them in and see for ourselves to take away any doubts we may have had. I should have known but he was right. We asked him if he could locate a Limited and an XLT version with all the opinions we were looking for so we could see the price difference. Ted didn't have either in stock due to the very specific options we were looking for. He told us no problem that he would start trying to locate our specific vehicles and contact us tomorrow. We came back the next day once Ted had located both vehicles with every option we asked for. After going over the prices we made our decision and Ted said it would take one day to get the vehicle in. On Saturday morning Ted contacted me and said ""Your vehicle is in and getting detailed now!!! Congratulations!!!"". Now because of the job I do I was allowed a bonus cash incentive off from Ford but I had to contact my HR department to get a PIN number first. I was unable to do that Friday and had already figured we had to wait until Monday for my HR department to provide the PIN to finish the deal. I called Ted and he said no let me work on this and let me ""Do what I do"". Thirty minutes later Ted said was he able to get that info for me and we were a go. About two hours later we were leaving the dealership in our new vehicle. Ted went the extra mile to get my wife and I the exact vehicle we wanted and into that vehicle on that day. He was very patient and professional and at no time did we feel pressured or hurried into making a decision. I have bought a lot of vehicles in my life and have dealt with a lot of car salesmen but Ted is by far the best one I have ever dealt with. I would even venture to say he was more like dealing with a long time friend instead of a salesman. Ted has my respect and my business for life.  Thanks Ted       ",5.0

And while great work says great things about a company, the personal interaction and communication really emphasizes what a company strives to achieve. While I don't feel the overall dealership is a 5 star dealer (Accessory department was a joke (avoid at all cost), management needs improvement in regards to customer service) Cody Mathes on the other hand provided everything that makes the purchase of a new vehicle a 5 star experience. From consistent communication to structuring the best deal, he provides those key elements the second you walk through the door.",4.2

He went through around 7 vehicles that I liked and tried to get me approved, after several failures I had to leave to take care of my daughter. He made sure to keep in touch with me because I wanted the vehicle and he took me serious even though I'm only 22, he found many vehicles I liked and then one showed up on the lot he knew I'd like. He then send me pics to my phone and asked about how I liked the truck. It had everything I wanted and then some. He worked with me on price and still took the time to help me even though some banks said to give up on me. He got me into a f150 fx4x4 fully loaded at a reasonable price and made sure I was satisfied. People have a hard time getting what they want from a dealership hit Tim literally used his day off to still try and get me my vehicle.

1241,"May 05, 2017","Showed up to Jordan Ford to look at a used F150 and ended up working with Lee Efting.  The truck I showed up to test drive unfortunately didn't do it for me.   Problem was there were no others in the price range I was working with.  Lee offered to see what he could do.  
Initially I was worried since other dealers say that but then just try to get you to keep increasing your budget.  Instead Lee found a truck for me and immediately offered it to me in the price range I was comfortable with.  No running back and forth to a ""manager"" or playing price games etc.

It ended up being on a lot that was about an hour away.  Lee drove it down the next day so I could look at it.   It ended up being the perfect truck for me.  Best thing was when the time came to sit down and work through the numbers, they all matched with what I had been promised.  They also offered me more for my trade-in than two other dealers.

In short, no price games, no bait and switch, no ""oh we forgot about this fee and that"".  All questions were answered immediately and were correct with no last minute ""surprises"".   Great experience and I will absolutely come here first for my next vehicle purchase.

When I called Gus about it, he not only remembered me from our first transaction a year prior, he remembered that I live just five minutes from the Jordan Ford location in Live Oak, TX. Gus offered to go get the truck from San Marcos and bring it down to Live Oak for me. Sure enough, the next day Gus made good on his word and I didn't have to drive 45 minutes to look at the vehicle. Finally, there was some extra paperwork involved in processing my trade; that was totally my fault. Gus even made the phone calls and completed the additional paperwork for me so I didn't have to lift a finger to clean my own mess. He helped me gather my personal items from my trade-in. He even made extra effort to get me into the purchasing office extra fast. If someone from Jordan Ford is reading this, you have a loyal customer now thanks mostly to Gus Ponce. I consider him to be a tremendous asset to your company and I hope to do more business with him in the future. ",5.0

Manny was courteous, informative, understanding when we wanted to compare multiple trucks, and patient. We didn't find what we really wanted and went to another dealership. Manny took the time to search wide and far and sent us a text to say he found exactly what we wanted approximately 250 miles away at another dealership.

1371,"January 27, 2017","Great Dealership and Sales guys- Steve Nichols offered EXCELLENT help through the entire buying process. He listened to what we needed and followed through.

We wanted a certain set of safety features but our budget was not unlimited. We first pursued a listing from edmunds.com at Jordan, but decided to keep looking. Steve took honest note of what we were looking for and sent us a single text the next day with a link to a car he believed fit our needs that they had in stock.

We continued to look around at other dealers and I cannot describe some frustration we had with OTHER dealers either 1) asking us to look at cars that did not have the features we needed 2) lied about features over the phone in order to get our foot in the door for a test drive 3) not knowing their own product they were selling.

We returned a couple of days later to Steve at Jordan Ford who pointed us to a car that fit our needs and budget on the nose. He was genuinely friendly and helpful and helped us get through the buying process without a headache. 

I feel like I have gotten a crash course(oops a pun) in car dealerships in the San Antonio area in the past week. Our experience with Steve and Jordan Ford was by far the most friendly and least pushy. They just listened to what we needed and found the right car, it was great.

1372,"January 09, 2017","I can be a difficult customer. There it is in black and white. Buying a new vehicle is always a stressful process that my wife and I dread. Actually, she dreads it more than I, but keeping her happy is my number one priority, and I didn't miss on that account by coming to Jordan again. This is my second vehicle purchase from Jordan Ford, and this time went even better than the first. To start with, the sales staff is friendly and informative. Not once did I feel that ""Salesman"" vibe from any of these folks.
I started my search on line, and when I found this prospect at Jordan I called and connected with Gabriel Llanas. He was very accommodating to my busy schedule, and we conducted most of the negotiations over the phone and by text. I even did the test drive on my lunch break, Gabe had everything lined up. I'll admit, I shared my wife's skepticism on whether everything could be set up and all we had to do was show up, sign and drive. It just seemed like a tall order, but Gabriel said, ""No problem"", and Gabriel delivered.  In less than 24 hrs., Gabriel and the staff at Jordan worked very hard to make this deal happen, from finding the best price for my trade in, to getting all the t's crossed and i's dotted, and at the end of the process I can honestly say I feel like I got the best deal possible with the least stress imaginable. 
We showed up at the appointed time, and in less than 90 minutes, we were on our way home. Now bear in mind that time was spent on a second test drive by my wife, setting down with Rhonda from accessories and adding a few goodies, and signing the final paperwork. This is the way car buying should be each and every time, and apparently at Jordan Ford it is. 
Just a quick word about Rhonda and Craig. These are the folks many people hate sitting down with. The ""sales pitch"" to add more on, from accessories to warranties, it always seems, pressured, but once again, Jordan set the bar higher. Both Rhonda and Craig laid out our options, discussed the pros and cons and not once, repeat, not once, did well feel that ""push"" to add something we didn't want. Great folks, thanks.
To wrap it up, I can count on one hand the number of times I've left a review for any one on line, much less a car dealership, but today I can say Jordan Ford is my #1 pick for all my car purchases, and Gabriel Llanas will be the salesman I seek out when that time comes. Great job Jordan Ford and thanks Gabriel.     ",4.6

I hated buying new cars because of the high pressure tactics and haggling back and forth.  I heard great things about Jordan Ford and the car buying experience was fantastic.  Cody Robinson was my sales representative and he was very knowledgeable about the vehicle and strait forward with the pricing and accessories and explained any questions I had, to my satisfaction.  The price of the car was substantially lower than the other dealers I checked on line with.  I highly recommend Cody for purchasing your next vehicle at Jordan Ford.  
I purchased some accessories from Rhonda Saylor and she was very knowledgeable about all items for my car, very friendly and explained all items to my satisfaction, with no pressure to buy.  
The final paperwork was put together by Al Garcia and he explained all of the pricing, extras, the extended warranty and was very informative on any questions I had.  
I could not have had a better experience in buying a new car and I love Jordan Ford.
Thanks Cody, Rhonda and Al for your kindness and professionalism. 

P.S.:  Just had service done on the car (oil change, transmission fluid change, the ""works"" package and thought I heard a noise coming from the front end and 2 people checked into this problem), and my advisor was Adrian Logan and he listened to all my concerns, explained work to my satisfaction and when work was done he expedited the final paperwork quickly (the work took an hour longer than estimated, but I've been praying for more patience and I had no problem with this extra time).  The car was clean and looked great when I drove if off the lot.

1387,"October 26, 2016","Daniel Bernat with Jordan Ford is by far the absolute best sales associate I have ever had the pleasure of dealing with. I do not exaggerate. This poor man has worked with me for roughly six months to make certain I got into the exact vehicle I wanted at a price I could afford. I got so discouraged that I began looking for vehicles over 200 miles away just to save a thousand dollars. Even with the possibility of me not purchasing from him, Daniel still gave me his input and advice on the vehicles I was looking at and gave me his opinion as to why they were or were not a good deal. With all the time and effort he has invested in me personally, I really wanted to purchase my vehicle with Jordan Ford (through him). Well today, he made that dream a reality. I never in my lifetime thought I would get into a used top-of-the-line Ford Escape Titanium for anywhere near $250 a month. And that's exactly what Daniel did for me today. It may not seem like a big deal to most,  but when you are on crunch time trying to find a replacement for your emission spewing VW Jetta TDI that is supposed to be bought back by VW in less than 2 weeks,  life becomes a little stressful.  Daniel pulled through for me with flying colors.  Not only did he go above and beyond for little ol me by providing excellent customer service,  but he made me feel like family.  Trust me,  there is a huge difference between treating someone like family and making them feel like family.  Daniel Bernat did just that for me.   A HUGE thank you to Daniel! I sincerely appreciate you from the bottom of my heart.  And wherever you may be working when I'm ready to purchase my next vehicle,  rest assured I will hunt you down and buy from you again lol.  Couldn't ask for anything more from this man.  Thank you again.",5.0

1395,"March 29, 2016","If you are looking for a new or used car or truck, then Jordan Ford is the place to go.  It is also important to talk to Cody Robinson once you get there.

I have bought 12 vehicles over the past 15 years, the last 3 coming from Jordan (2013 Focus SE, 2015 Expedition Limited, 2016 F150 XLT Sport).  Each and every transaction was hassle free and well worth the time it took to drive from New Braunfels down to San Antonio.

Cody understands his customers.  He treats you with utmost respect, and truly is a dedicated car dealer.  He is also a certified master trainer on the F-150 and Expedition (I don't know the official Ford term for this certification).  But, it shows.  He can tell you more about the vehicles than the owner's manual!

From beginning to end of the deal, Cody is there the whole time.  He communicates consistently, and even as I changed my mind about 50 times each purchase, he was never afraid to tell us his opinion on why one option is better than the next, all without trying to sell us something.  He even mentioned that some things I thought we a ""must have"" certainly were not, thus saving me even more money.  If all he cared about was the sale and his commission, he would have never said anything.  He would rather us be happy than him make more money.

I can't forget my fiance guru Jose Rosas either.  He was very informative and even helped us save more money and avoid financing headaches.  I came in with my own financing and never once tried to convince me of dealer add ons or other financing.  He knew i had the best deal around and worked with us to finish it up quickly and easily.

Overall, I could talk about Jordan Ford for a  long time.  I have been to almost every other Ford dealer within a 50 mile radius, and I keep coming back to them.  For someone who changes or adds vehicles as often as I do, Jordan is the place to ensure I am getting what I need at the price I want.

Thanks Cody Robinson and Jordan Ford!

I called first thing when they opened and didn't get an answer from them until I called back at 1pm.  Jordan had not sent the check to pay off my loan (the ""check had been cut"" the same day that I called conveniently). They did not give me a reason as to why and now I have no other choice but to wait for my credit union to get the check from Jordan before I get any kind of reimbursement from anyone.... OH and to top it off I am responsible for the interest that has been incurred these past several days on my trade-in vehicle's loan amount. Interesting enough, my friend purchased a vehicle 2 days before I did and the same thing happened to the pay off on their trade-in but they were originally told that they had lost his paperwork but some to find that it was due to an error on the paperwork causing the delay.

They could have just parked it out back and made me wait 2 hours. He said to bring it back two days later and meet with him, which I did, but he was ""stuck in a meeting"". I figured since they had already wasted 2 hours of my time, he would have at least left instructions to have it done immediately - nope, I was told to wait 1:15 to 1:30. I left, called his office, and told his secretary I can get the oil changed elsewhere in 20 minutes, and the tires rotated elsewhere in 20 minutes. The quality of service is unsatisfactory considering I just bought a $50K truck there. To top it off, I never heard back after that.

The power distribution box was also open by the vandal(s). Now those wires are burned and the power distribution box is fried because the wire that were pulled out vandals got up against the exhaust manifold. How can wires get against the exhaust manifold if the mechanics at Jordan Collision check and secured the wires as stated on my invoice/receipt.

This service per a letter was to take less tham half a day.  When I showed up I was not met by a service advisor but actually had to enter the dealership.  After being told that they wanted to keep the car for several days.  I asked ""Why, since I had scheduled the service"".  I was told by the service advisor that ""it didn't matter, scheduling doesn't give you priority you have to wait you turn in line like everyone else"".  So what is the point of scheduling? I asked. Then I asked if they were going to give us something to drive.  In an accusitory tone he said that ""Since I had not purchased an Extended Service Agreement at the time I bought the car I was not enititled to any rental"".  I told him to skip the recall repair.  The bad attitude did not stop at this.  In leaving the advisor did not go over the paperwork with us even though I needed a new Air Filter thereby Jordan Ford lost out on a sale.  When leaving my husband informed the man that his boss Service Manager MIke Davis was a personal friend we had known for many years.  At THAT time Mr. Vasquez finally starts back pedaling due to his bad behavior.  Too late, I would not recommend Jordan Ford to anyone at this time until they figure out what Customer Service really is. ",1.8
1437,"August 14, 2012","My vehicle was taken in for suspension repair and body repair; it took two months to get my car back. When I did, I was overcharged by $600 and they have yet to ""get paperwork together"" to find where the problem was at. So it's been a month and a half and everyone continues to give me excuses. I have not received a reimbursement until this day. Adrian kept stressing that he was getting the parties together to come to a solution and when I spoke to a different representative, no one was even aware of the situation. Now to the service, they insisted I needed new rotors in the front because they were warped, I got my car back and my rear right rotor is making noises. To add on, the front left wheel is still clicking when I turn, pops when I hit the brakes, and pops when I put the vehicle in reverse. Even further, my air pressure sensor fault light is on; and please keep in mind my car was in the shop specifically for suspension repair. What did they do exactly for 4k that I was charged? Still trying to figure it out. I would love to take my vehicle back so they can fix the issues; why haven't I, I'm afraid I'll have to wait another month and pay more money, perhaps take the risk of being overcharged again. Take your business elsewhere people, they don't value customers how they say they do. ",1.4

Did not intend to shop with Jordan Ford but wanted only to price the auto I intended to purchase from a dealership near Round Rock, TX. Meet sales associate Lee Efting, as I entered the show room, and from that moment I realized that this was the Dealership I would work with. Lee is a great sales professional, John, new car manager, is outstanding and quality staff led me to purchase two Fords from Lee. I recommend that you talk to Lee before you purchase your next Ford!!",5.0
1439,"June 14, 2012","First of all, I'd like to say this was my VERY BEST car buying experience by a long shot.  As a family, we've purchased over 5 cars in the past 3 years and I've never seen customer service the way I have at Jordan Ford! My husband and I were doing some comparison shopping on Memorial Day weekend for hybrids and had already been to two other dealerships (Toyota and Kia) before stopping in at Jordan Ford. We were interested in the Ford Fusion. Ernesto was our sales rep and took us on a very thorough test drive where he explained every feature on the car, the mechanics of the hybrid technology, and he demonstrated the Sync system voice command with our own phone. Afterward, he laid out the numbers for us and there was no pressure to buy or decide.  They loaned us the car to go and have lunch off site while they appraised my trade-in. I loved the Fusion, but they didn't have the color I wanted, so Ernesto personally found one for me at a nearby dealer.  A few days later, it was there detailed and ready for me. He kept me informed the whole way through from the time he found it to the time he was driving back to the dealership with it and even sent me pictures! I could not have asked for a better sales person! I got the feeling that this level of customer service wasn't reserved just for me, but it's something he does for every customer.  The icing on the cake came about a week later when I had an issue with the Bluetooth on the car.  When I spoke to Ernesto about it, he immediately offered to pick my car up from work (I have a super busy schedule) and bring it in for repair.  Who does that, especially now a days? I would recommend Jordan Ford, but especially Ernesto to anyone looking to buy a car.  I am completely satisfied and am extremely grateful for excellent customer service. The finance team also did a superior bank, finding an interest rate for me that beat my banks by half! And the sales supervisor, Mack Dodd, was helpful and very courteous. Way to go to the entire team!",4.6
1440,"January 25, 2012","I purchased a Ford Ranger (2008) from Ted Saldana at Jordan Ford on December 21, 2010. I was involved in an accident on January 14, 2012 and my ""new"" truck was totaled!  Ted was very helpful in walking me through the process at Jordan's Collision Center and even helped me get my tools etc. out of the wrecked vehicle and back to my home.  After I found out that the truck was a total loss, Ted immediately began the serach for a new vehicle for me.  Within one week, Ted found a replacement for me and was instrumental in getting the price right and all flaws taken care of so I could pick the 2010 Ranger up within the week!  If you ever need a car, I would highly recommend buying it from Jordan Ford in San Antonio Texas and ask for ""Ted Saldana"" when you get there.  Ted has a very winning way and is a man of great honesty and integrity.  I'll never buy a car from anyone else!  Gary E. Napper",5.0

1442,"December 12, 2011"," During three separate visits to Jordan Ford Ltd. located at 13010 IH-35 N San Antonio, TX, I purchased services for my 2008 Ford F150 titled ""The Works"". 

 After services were preformed I checked my oil.  On my first two visits the oil levels were about a half court low. During my third, and what I consider being my final visit, I had my front breaks replaced along with ""The Works Service"" which again was not fully completed; the power  steering  fluid  was not topped off sitting at the minimum level and also the oil level was this time at almost a half quart low.   

After my second service I was contacted by a follow-up survey phone call. I explained my issues and was told the information would be passed on and receive a follow-up which I have yet to receive.

I scheduled an appointment and the tech that does it wasn't even scheduled to work. After numerous calls with responses of it will be here tomorrow I finally got my truck a week later. I drove over an hour and a half to get there and realize they only did the backs. The service manager trys to get me out of his hair as soon as he can. He was going to call me the next day and I have left him several messages and still no call back. Problem still not resolved!!!

Left vehicle and then called late that afternoon and they said they  were still checking, so we left the car overnight.  Called about 9 the next morning and was told they were still in the progress of checking the car.  Called around 11 am on Sat. and was told they had not started on the car as of yet, so we went and got the vehicle from Jordan.

Also will call Ford on this Vehicle.",1.3

1449,"July 15, 2011","If you want your oil changed they are ok. Anything beyond that they are incapable of. They can't even fix a window regulator right, let alone a transmission. 5 times under warranty for the trans and they couldn't/wouldn't fix it. Do yourself a favor and check for fords transmission problems. They are more concerned about selling you a hands free telephone/sound system (sync?) than selling you a reliable vehicle. At least you can call for a tow truck with both hands on the steering wheel now. BTW, I've wrenched on aircraft for 25 years so I'm not completely lost when it comes to automotive repairs",1.8

1455,"January 28, 2011","I took a car in for an oil change and asked them to look at the tires.  The car was 7 years old with original tires, and although they still looked like new I was concerned.

When I picked up the car they said the tires were fine but I needed new brakes (hmmm...but ok).

I took the car in two weeks later to get new brakes (I drive that car about 5 miles a week) and when I picked it up guess what the recommendation was?  I should get new tires!

I did get new tires somewhere else.  But when I took the car in for routine maint a few months later guess what the recommendation was - new brakes!

Two months ago I had a problem where the car was just dead, no click, no lights, not nothing.  After pulling the battery and taking it to the place I bought it, they said it was perfect (it was fairly new).  After I put it back in, and I tried the car again it started.

I took it to Jordan for that and I also mentioned it was running rough.

$1,000 later I got my car back.  The part they said I needed for the starting was around $500 but if I got the major tune up they said I needed for the rough running, it would be less.

Last week the car was dead again - same thing.  Opened the hood, checked the battery cables (that were tight) and shut it, and it started.  It's happened the same way twice since then, so I took it in yesterday.

I got a call today saying the problem was the battery cables.  I asked about the $500 part they sold me 2 months ago and they said the sheet just says you brought it in because it was running rough....so I guess a tune up at Jordan costs $1,000 now???

I don't trust them anymore.",2.6
1456,"January 08, 2011","Both times we've taken our 2007 Taraus in for service Richard Witowski has been superb in all aspects of the visit. He made us feel welcome, kept us informed of what was being done to the car from start to finish. He called us with updates, If it was kept over night, ensured my wife and I had transportation available if needed. Once the repairs were completed, Richard went over the invoice explaining each item in detail answering all our questions. 

He is why we take our car to Jordon Ford. Richard is very professional, friendly, warm, shows concern about his customers and knows what he's talking about.

1458,"December 14, 2010","My entire experience with Jordan Ford was very positive. No games, no gimmicks, no hassle.  I actually left Northside Ford after playing the 'monthly payment game' too long with them.  I already knew what car I was looking for, and Cody my sales rep was fantastic.  We went over the specials going on, and strictly negotiated the price of the car. In fact they gave me a very aggressive price out of the gate, almost too aggressive, I was actually bracing myself for a really hard time in finance, but the finance manager didn't try to push anything on us, or make us buy anything. He offered and that was it. 

Overall it was the most painless car buying experience I've had in the 15 years I've been buying new cars.  I would highly recommended going to Jordan Ford if you're in the market for a new Ford car or truck. ",5.0

The following month I had another oil change, and again I was told I needed a fuel filter.

This September 2010, I took my ford back again for repairs, tjis time my air condition was only blowing hot air. I was then told three different parts all broke at the sams time.
