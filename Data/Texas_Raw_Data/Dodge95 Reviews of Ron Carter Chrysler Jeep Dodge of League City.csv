0,"April 15, 2020","I bought 2 used vehicles from the Ron Carter Dealership in League City towards the end of February 2020.. I was sold two LEMONS and feel completely taken advantage of as a woman consumer. For Car A had a broken motor mount and Car B had damage underneath the front end. They fixed the motor mount on Car A. While driving Car B it felt like the power steering went out. I was frustrated, but I thought it would be okay because I bought the extended warranty. So when the service person from Ron Carter LC called to inform there was damage under the front end and asked if I had wrecked it I was baffled! I had never wrecked the car. The CarFax showed it had been in an accident from the back. The sales person reassured me it was minor. Ron Carter League City either intentionally sold a vehicle with damage or did not do an appropriate inspection of the vehicle. I bought from they because I thought they were a reputable company but that is NOT the product or service that was was provided. Please be cautious and think twice before buying from this establishment. ",1.0

If I have to buy another car, the salesman will be David Holman.  He shows concern, he knew my budget, He found me a car I could afford, and it has been a great car. ",5.0

5,"January 28, 2020","I would like to take this time to express my gratitude for the great service my wife and I recently received at your dealership. We had decided that it was time to do a bit of car shopping for a Jeep. I received an email concerning the interest that Ron Carter had in purchasing my 2016 Scat Pack Challenger, so just out of curiosity I submitted my information to test the waters on where I stood. It wasn’t very long before I received an email from your representative ( Ray Pennington ).
From the moment we began discussing my interests in trading In my Challenger, I felt comfortable talking with Ray and somehow knew that he was a straight shooter.
We spoke for a while and told him I’d have to work on my wife coming on board and as soon as I could convince her to make the move we’d come into see him.
The very next day she agreed to go talk with Ray and see where we stood.

As we arrived at the dealership I let a young man know that we were here to speak to Ray, and he took us right to him. He immediately gained our trust and let us know that he would not let us down. We talked and joked around while simultaneously he was informing us of the options that we had available to us. We have bought several vehicles from numerous dealerships, but I’m here to tell you that our experience at Ron Carter Jeep in League City was by far the best car buying experience that we have ever had, and this is because of your sales person Ray Pennington. 

I would highly recommend Ray and your dealership to any of my friends and family looking to purchase a new or used car from. He kept telling us that we were now part of the family and I’m here to tell you that my wife and I truly believe that he strives to insure that customers feel that way.
In closing, thank you for the awesome Jeep and the outstanding service that Ray provided for us, in our view he is top of the line, as I’m sure you already know.
We truly enjoyed Ray, Audrey, and the entire Ron Carter family.

8,"December 14, 2019","I want to recognize the sales consultant that helped me pick out my Dodge 2019 pick up truck and his name is Jose Martinez.
I really appreciate Jose doing his very best to get the right price for my pickup.
I went by the dealership yesterday and as soon as he saw me pull up he came right out and put on my new license tags on the truck.
I give this dealership a five star plus so  come by and see Jose for a good deal.",5.0
9,"November 07, 2019",3 hrs wait for a oil change and tire rotation and the quality of  the job was beyond poor( the quality). they lost one screw of each center cap of the wheels which I did notice it  when went back home and drove back to the dealer to ask for an explanation of the missing screws which Ashley and the the person in charge of the mechanics agree to replace them and it's been 3 weeks later and stop by to ask and they haven't even order the screws for the wheels yet. I ask to talk to the Manager of the Service dept. and he's excuse 3 weeks later he needs the VIN number of the jeep which  they have my info because I did bought the Jeep at the Dealer and change the oil there.Last time I go there and do any business there I thrust them to do a simple job and they fail to do it.  At least contact me to let me know about it.Poor quality of Customer service. ,1.0
10,"October 16, 2019",I was shopping for a new ram 3500 for my company and went to 5 ram dealerships across the houston area and was not getting the deal a wanted. Raul Lora not only got me the deal I wanted I was able to get a better truck with more features. No back and forth like the headache I dealt with other dealers.  I told him what I could afford and got me in my new truck. I totally recommend Ron Carter.  The drive was worth it and I will always come back. ,5.0

12,"August 21, 2019","BEWARE! The price advertised on their website for their vehicles is a scam (shady sales tactic) to get you there and in the door. I went to buy a car and told the salesman of the price listed on their website to which he agreed. We went in to do the paperwork and the back and forth game began from salesman to managers. The manager came over and told me that the internet price was not correct and to read the ""disclaimers."" SHADY business practices. Manager was rude and extremely unprofessional. The price they came up with was $8K MORE than the internet price! Even the salesman apologized and said this practice wasn't right. DO NOT BUY HERE..BEWARE.",1.0
13,"May 15, 2019","I purchased a Jeep SRT here in 2014, and have been a loyal customer since. They recently performed some warranty repair on the front suspension of my vehicle. All of the bolts holding the front fascia of the vehicle are missing, with no damage to any of the holes where they bolt together. So they tell me the reason they are gone is not because they forgot to put them back in, but because the car was hit, Mind you there is no damage to the exterior, no damage to were the bolt holes are, miraculously the only thing that happened was all the retaining bolts just fell straight out. They lost a customer today, and a near future trackhawk sale. Use at your own risk. It's unfortunate that I now have to go find another dealer to frequent.",2.4
14,"April 06, 2019","Transmission falls out of gear, falls from 8th to 1st randomly. Engine rattles (bottom end) on cold start. When driving 65mph on windy day the air travels through front windshield which causes a very loud whistling noise. Truck has been in service 3 different times. We contacted Chrysler and have had 2 different case numbers. We haven't even had it for 6 months! Tried trading out of it. But we find out from Hector (salesman) it's $11,000.00 upside down! We were flat out told ""next time the Transmission falls out of gear to just blow it up"" and we just aren't comfortable with that! We have tried numerous times to speak to management only to be told (Brandy and Robert) that she isn't in. So, we are stuck with a brand new truck which isn't safe to drive!",1.0
15,"March 08, 2019","No aveability of the decired  truck, discounts hide and poor, they try to sell you warranty on  top  of the factory warranty, truck came with 5 years warranty from factory and they sell you 7 years for 2000.00 and more so in reality you are buying 2 years extended warranty , the woman on the finance department is not really kind at all , I ask to fax the papers to my bank and she ask me if I want she pay for my lunch too, very profesional Jordan Madera, impress with his knowledge and kindness , very nice and helpful seller. prices over standing, limited negotiation on process to buy, never buy or recommend this place again",3.3
16,"February 25, 2019","Ive got a 2010 Dodge ram 1500. Bought at Ron Carter in league city. There was a recall on whats called a rear pinion nut.  In 2013 i took the truck in for an AC problem, i didnt even know about the recall previously mentioned. So i was driving about 30 mph when my rear wheels locked up and my drive shaft snapped in two pieces and im stranded on the side of the road. I have the truck towed to ron carter to be fixed under this recall that i learned about, after the truck broke down, by looking it up online. Ron Carter says they fixed the problem in 2013 when i serviced the AC issue. I had no idea they did this for me. Well if they did, the recall repair failed and caused further damage to the rear end of my truck. Ron Carter will not make this repair, and Dodge is putting it off on the dealership, the dealership says its up to dodge. Im fed up. Noone will claim this, noone will help and what happened to my truck is what the recall explicitly describes may happen if this pinion nut comes loose. ... Ron Carter League City",1.0

18,"November 02, 2018","After choosing this dealership to have my large insurance claim done, I received the worst possible treatment from my service person, Danny and the service manager,Robert Jackson.  After taking so long to do the repairs, my insurance would no longer pay for a rental car. They agreed to let me use a loaner car. The first loaner car had a brake issue that was very apparent. After reporting this to Robert, I was told nothing was wrong with it and I was exaggerating. Finally Robert brought me a new loaner. When he arrived at my work, he didn't say a word and jumped into the other vehicle and sped off trying to hear the brake noise. He came back and claimed he didn't hear anything and it was all in my head. He slammed down the loaner papers, told me to sign and slammed the door when he left. That afternoon I got into the loaner for the first time and saw a chip in the top right of the windshield. I immediately called and reported it to Danny and he told me not to worry that they knew about it. My car was finally repaired after 35 days. Today, I get a letter in the mail from my insurance company that they filed a glass claim on me. I called to speak with Robert and see why he would lie and he continuously argued. They wouldn't let me speak to managment and hung up on me. I tried calling back several times to speak with management and they would hang up on me. Plus my brand new engine is now making a rattling noise. ",1.0

29,"September 13, 2018","Ron Carter League City is by far the best Jeep dealership I have been to so far.  Wes, in Service, went out of his way for me every step of the way.  I was concerned about an ETC light on the dashboard of my Jeep that just popped up on my 2016 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited.  I am a single Mom so I have to be extra cautious that my Jeep is always running smoothly.  I cannot risk getting stranded.  Wes got me in the very next day and resolved my issue.  I even met the mechanic who was amazing too.  They explained everything to me.  I feel safe and at peace on the road now.  I will definitely go back to see Wes for all of my Jeep needs.",5.0
30,"August 07, 2018","My car was taken to service department from another body shop to get a factory item calibrated.  Technician was test driving my car and he got rear ended.  No, it wasnt his fault but the vehicle was in their possession and they are not offering any kind of help to me...my cat has depreciated again, I had claim their wreck on my own insurance, they won't assist me w a loaner nor have I even gotten a ""i'm sorry this happened"" from anyone at the dealership. I was told by the service manager to deal w their Insurance company.... that's all I have got from these unprofessional group of people!  I have gotten a lot of legal advice re this situation....so now i'm serving the ball.
I have driven a jeep for over 10 years, I still am...and I know alot of jeepers and I will make this incident well known to the public.",1.0
31,"August 06, 2018",Asked to finance a vehicle through my credit union. Salesperson ran my credit through FIVE different lenders without telling me. Horrible for my credit.

32,"May 29, 2018","I've used Ron Carter for years for both service and new car purchases, but times have changed for the worse.  These days a lot of shopping is done via internet, and then the purchase is completed in person at the dealer.  In my case, the salesperson emailed a window sticker for the car I was looking for, but when I arrived at the dealer to finalize the sale, the car we discussed was ""not available"".  Tony said he had others, but clearly the setup was a deception to trick me into coming to the dealership to sell me on another car.  Trickery and deceit might sell some cars, but it's not a good success strategy.  Beware and triple check to be sure they really have the car you discussed, so you won't be a victim of a bait and switch.",2.0
33,"December 30, 2017",I did not purchase my car here but Chrysler roadside assistance towed it to dealership closest to home.  I have been lucky and have not had to take a car in for service under warranty. I have always heard nightmares about dealerships service. This was a wonderful experience from them. First Alex helped me on the phone and talked me down after a really bad day with a less than two-year-old car that broke down. The next day when they were due to look at it I found out Alex was on holiday vacation and was worried no one would care as much as he seemed to. Wes took over and was incredibly helpful and pleasant. I probably drove him crazy because I was in a big hurry to get it back and he was very patient with me. I have been in hotel management for years and I know what good customer service is. This was 5 star service all the way around!!!,5.0
34,"December 29, 2017","HORRIBLE Service Department. They refused to work with Jeep/Chrysler headquarters after my Instrument Cluster went out. They wanted me to pay for the entire repair on a vehicle with 18,000 miles on it even though Corporate agreed to replace it. I am now taking my business and my entire Jeep Club's business to a different dealer. I am always going to own a Jeep after the response from Corporate Headquarters but Ron Carter just lost at least 16 customers who will not only no longer use their Service Department but all future sales of some very avid Jeep lovers.

35,"June 16, 2017","Just bought a new 2017 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited from this dealership. It was a great experience with everyone involved! The salesman were helpful, and the finance department was quick, and not pushy at all. I was not hassled about anything extra that I did not want to purchase (i.e. Extended Warranty). I will say- go online for better pricing first, before you go to test drive. ",4.8
36,"May 10, 2017","Rate is for the service department. Keep in mind all these issues were later fixed at Gulfgate Dodge Chrysler Jeep and Ram. It was a horrible experience at first the service manager made it seem as he would take care of me and my issues with my car. After I went in to take photos of the issues for submition to Chrysler he told me there would be a wait for them to respond. After about 3 weeks and no follow up of any kind I call myself and the manager tells me to call back in a week. The whole thing goes on for about 2 more weeks so I decide to go in and take them my car and they said they would take care of the issues I felt relief and patiently waited. They keept the car for about three more weeks and I never once received a call from the manager or any service advisor. I had to call every other day to get an update and was always placed on hold or hung up on. To make a long story short after they told me to pick up the car ""it was ready"" only one issue was PARTIALLY fixed with tape. And the other 3 were not. I was fed up with the lies from the manager and other advisors and took my car to Gulfgate. Overall horrible service experience. Stay away. On the other hand Gulfgate Dodge took care of everything in a couple of days.",1.0

51,"June 20, 2016","I recently purchased a new 2016 Jeep Wrangler from Ron Carter League City and I have to share that it was the WORST experience I've ever had in all my years of buying vehicles. The dishonesty, deceptiveness, and untrustworthy manner in which my trade was handled was so bad. I had a deal made on my trade in and the amount was well established. All I had to do was wait for our jeep to arrive and come in and sign the papers. I was asked to put $1000 down until it arrived and had no problem doing it. Once I came to pick up my vehicle I waited for over an hour and noticed the salesman and sales manager going back & forth. I wasn't sure why as the deal was done. Once we got ready to go into finance I was then told my trade would be $1500 less. I was shocked and appalled. I spent the next 45 minutes arguing with the sales manager, Danny, and salesman, Marcos, and finally settle on a trade value (mind you that was already done a week ago with a signed agreement) and was still shorted $700. Why did I buy it...like everything else...way too much time invested to start over. I told them that day that I would ensure I let people know how I was treated and I've done that with well over 30 people that asked me about my new Jeep. Horrible, horrible, horrible experience. Find somewhere else as these guys were very dishonest and if they did it to me then they've done it to others and will do it to you. Beware!!!

I've left a voicemail message for the GM, Patti Pike, and even made a visit and left my name and # since she wasn't there. It's been almost two weeks since my first request to speak with her and nothing has been returned. No luck yet.

52,"June 17, 2016","Patti Pike expects her staff to treat customers with respect and dignity! That's one reason this dealership is selling so many cars, because they care, and glad they have an opportunity to meet your needs! She appreciates her employee's, and they don't mind helping each other with a customer, they all are on the same page! Danny, the U/C manager, will give you what your auto's worth, he don't hold back! The finance dept. will get you the best rate, and take care of all the paperwork, and quickly too. Just ask for ""The Ron Carter Deal"" you wont be disappointed!!! Oh Yeah....Thank you Patti for the fill up!

I was all thumbs. I finally chose to go to Ron Carter in League City. Several of my coworkers have been talking about them over the past 3 months, talking good about them and I wanted to see for myself what all the buzz was about. I ran into David HOLMEN. Just talk to me if you can believe that. He asked me what I was looking for, my price range, I mean he just talked. There was no pressure in buying the truck there was no pressure and we have to do it now let's sit down now and do it. He took the complicatedness out of buying a truck. They treated me like a person and not a sale. Also when I had to deal with the service department to get my running boards on I dealt with  Wes. He was very knowledgeable and help me did get things done. I'm the kind of guy that sticks with a  vehicle for a while I'm not always trading in every two years. But I believe in honesty loyalty and that the money that someone works hard for should be invested without being pressured. If you're looking to invest, to get what you deserve in life, then come see my new family Ron Carter in League City. It's definitely worth the drive.",5.0
56,"February 20, 2016",We originally bought a Jeep Grand Cherokee in December for myself. Austin was extremely patient even when I drove  almost every vehicle on the lot before I decided on the Grand Cherokee! He went above and beyond to make sure our car buying experience was enjoyable.   We went back a couple of weeks ago to purchase a car for my son.  This time we had both Austin and Rex helping us. Both listened carefully to what we and our son were looking for and took the time to locate the perfect car for him.  We will definitely be going back to Ron Carter in the future. ,5.0

68,"October 16, 2015", I'm from San Antonio Texas..I'm just visiting this area for the summer season. I recently received recall notices for my 2014 Dodge ram 3500.. The nearest Dodge Dealership Was Ron Carter Dodge in Dickinson. I called the service center department to make the appointment. Dana… The friendly professional woman I spoke with had me set up for service in no time. I was told it may take a couple of days to do all that needed to be done. Before the end of the day I had received notice that my vehicle was ready for pick up. Fast friendly service is what we all expect.. And is exactly what I received... So this is why I'm writing this review to let the service department at Ron Carter Dodge know how impressed I am with their friendly service and professionalism.. With special thanks to Dana for making the experience so pleasant.,5.0

88,"March 23, 2015","Wow, really surprised at how much of a xxxxx their service writer was with me. Had recall work, a TSB, and a STAR case # for sludging coolant on my 2012 Chrysler product. Had the pleasure of speaking to Wes Shelton in service who sounded like he was enjoying a tasty granola bar when he was talking to me. After hearing what I was bringing the car in for, and after he snacked some more on his granola bar and had a few sips of his refreshing beverage, he told me he could schedule me to come in the next week, although no appointment time or confirmation was given. He then asked ME what I did do the coolant. This issue is beyond common on 2012 Dodge and Chrysler vehicles, so I calmly explained to him the causes that had been found which resulted in the STAR case # being produced. He then asked ME what the repair process was for the TSB and the STAR case # even though surely he already knew after we discussed the symptoms. I told him the repair process, and his exact words...""You gonna pay for all that?""  That was all I needed to hear from him.

I have been driving Dodge / Chrysler products for the last 20 years, and have dealt with some good service departments and some not so much. If this is the kind of person I am going to be dealing with at this dealership, then I will never take any of my vehicles here. Not for service, not for parts, not for any new vehicle purchases. Thanks for showing a genuine interest Wes, you're a real gem. Great find Ron Carter.......",1.0

94,"January 10, 2015",The problem was associated with a recent recall that has no final solution.  Ron Carter and Jeep step up and took full ownership of the problem. Had my car back on the road in 2 days with a commitment to install the full solution as soon as it is released. They took the initiative to also install two other minor recalls and perform full diagnostics to insure my vehicle was performing at peak capability. A top notch service organization supporting a superior vehicle brand.  ,5.0
