1,"February 27, 2019",I took my truck in for my routine service  and open ticket problems.  Nathan Scott called me and stated that this thing Refering to my vehicle is 4000 miles over on oil change and need a filter. I tried to explain that there is an open ticket . He didn’t want to hear it. If anything is wrong with an open ticket Take it back to them. I told him my truck was not over for oil change and that is why is was there... He said oh I did not know that...He never wrote it on the ticket. I was upset that nothing was addressed. My truck was not serviced . That was the main reason it was there. I Told him That was okay do not service and I will pick up my vehicle in a now. I come in he was rude and did not speak.I waited a while on him after I arrived he was very rude and angry. He repeated the statements dropped the pen on the counter. So he didn’t have to touch me.  Told me I was going to listen to him I said I’m not and don’t have to... I asked for his Manager and told him he was being prejudice ... I left out going to my truck and he ran outside got  up in my face screaming after I walked out... The workers had to get him . He was irate . I feel I was being prejudiced against Being a female . And  Bullied . All of this is on video . I will Be filing a formal complaint BBB FCC and General Motors. ,1.0
2,"June 19, 2018","I purchased a GM C Terrain  from 
Carlisle Chevrolet Buick GM C Cadillac in Waxahachie, Tx.  I had a concern about the vehicle I was given and i called to speak to the General Manager Ronald Ferguson. Mr. Ferguson refused to speak to me and yelled the entire time on the phone. He told me he didn't want to hear what I had to say or change his mind. I cant believe Carlisle's allow a person like Ronald Ferguson to be their General Manager and treat customers like he treated me. Carlisle claims customer satisfaction. Well I believe the General Manage Ronald Ferguson didn't get the memo because he sure was very very rude and refused to hear my concern. I must admit the sale person Dustin was very nice very curious and polite. Eddie the fiance person was also polite but I question his interest of the customer. Unfortunately I cant say the same for the General Manager Ronald Ferguson who was very very rude and disrespectful.",1.0
3,"May 08, 2018",Went to look at a truck that I honestly thought I wouldn't be able to get. But I was wrong I had a great salesman told him what I had as a trade worked the numbers and made it happen. I love how the overall experience was worth ever mintue we spent buying the Truck I never imagine having.,5.0
4,"March 06, 2018","This will be as short as the salesman was to me. I live 9 miles from this dealership and had been looking online for a few weeks. I stopped by after work and talked to a salesman for a few minutes describing what I was looking for, he took my trade in information and took pictures and told me he would email me some listings and give a quote for my trade in. Ended up I had to call them the next day and ask where the emails were and the quote. finally got the quote (from a different sales guy) which was 2k less than 2 other dealers I had been talking to, then he was very short on the phone telling me they didn't have what I was looking for when I hadn't even finished telling him what that was. Now I have to drive 65 miles to another dealer to get a truck. I would never recommend anyone that I knew to go to this dealership. For $40,000 I would think they would try and take care of what would have been a customer.",1.3
