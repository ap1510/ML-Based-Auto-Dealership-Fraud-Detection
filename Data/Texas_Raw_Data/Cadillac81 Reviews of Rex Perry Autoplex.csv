77,"May 13, 2014","I received a sales call from Dustin with Rex Perry explaining they had some loyalty incentives for returning customers and asked if i was in the market. I looked at the site and said you have a 2007 corvette listed at 33,995 and asked for the best price he could sell it for.He stated it could be sold for 30,000 out the door with tax,title and all other fees.Then when on to say with the owner loyalty anther 2500 off that price,so i would be looking at 27,500.I told him at that price i would be a buyer,this was on a Friday and had to leave town for the weekend so i called on Saturday and reached another salesman to make the deal.I explained the deal that Dustin had made and he checked with the sales manager and said the manager would not sell the vehicle for that price it would be about 32,500 plus all the fees.The first time Dustin was in the manager office when he called me on the deal.The other salesman said he was sorry that this happened.On Monday Dustin called me back on the deal I told him to fax me the deal on paper and it was the 32,500 plus all the fees,I told him this was not the price we agreed on not even close.When i looked closer at the deal the 2500 loyalty was not even for that vehicle and only for new vehicles from the manufacturer.A week goes by and he calls me back and lowered the price by 1,000 for the vehicle and i told him i purchased a corvette already. So much for the returning customer and the loyalty on their end.",2.3
78,"August 28, 2012","We purchased a new 2012 GMC Texas Edition Sierra truck.  They were great!  They gave us a great deal and took care of us with getting a spray-in bed liner and windows tinted.  We purchased a Hyundai Sonata a couple of years ago and had great service then, too.  We have continued to have our routine maintenance performed there and Billy Dicks and the service advisers are always good to us.

79,"February 27, 2012","Buying a vehicle from this dealership was by far the worst mistake in the 32 years that Ive been alive.   We were told that we were receiving a good running, non-smoking vehicle.  Well this is the complete opposite of what we actually got, but other than that it was a great deal!!!  When we receive it, there were cigarette hole burns all throughout the seats, and it barely drives a block before completely shutting down. haha. After countless hours of trying to get that cigarette smoke smell out of the car, ive just accepted it’s there to stay.  The truck has been in the shop probably a record amount of times in 2 months, which is 5, and as of today it sits in my driveway and isn’t starting again.  I won’t go into all of the repairs done, but I have already spent twice as much in repairs for this hunk of junk on wheels, than what I bought the car for.  There’s no telling what is wrong with it this time, but Im honestly starting to think that the previous owners actually drove this thing off the Grand Canyon at one time, then it sat lying at the bottom of the river for 2 years at which point rex perry auto plex towed it out of there, put it on their lot and sold it to us.  I would love to try and resale this thing, but I would not do that to my worst enemy like this dealership did to me.  So for us trusting someone and trying to save a buck we have absolutely screwed ourselves over.  I honestly believe that this company should have paid us to take this thing off their hands.  On top of everything we received very poor and unprofessional customer service from a couple of the workers....especially some Jared character, LIKE WE DID SOMETHING WRONG!!!  We will now end up trading this hunk of junk in, and spending WAY more than we ever wanted to.  I probably could have just gone in and bought a new vehicle in the first place instead of exhausting our stress levels and bank account with this situation.  I was going to just let the situation go, and not leave any feedback, but now that it wont start AGAIN, ive had it.  Please from me to you, beware of buying a car from this dealership.  I will never in my life trust somebodies word over the phone and by seeing pics on the internet again. ",1.8
80,"December 27, 2011","We purchased our new Hyundai and have loved it ever since!  The entire process was easy and we were able to get everything we wanted, including the price.  They also gave us a lifetime warranty at no additional cost, which we found out later they give to everyone who buys a new Hyundai.  Thanks Clarence and the Perry Hyundai team!",5.0
