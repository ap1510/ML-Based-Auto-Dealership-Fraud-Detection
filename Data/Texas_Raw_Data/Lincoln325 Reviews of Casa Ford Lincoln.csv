3,"October 07, 2019","I had never heard of Casa Kia until Saturday when I went looking for a Telluride.  Fortunately for me there was only 1 left.  My sales person Mr. Juan Rivera was the most courteous and knowledgeable person I have met. In addition, I have to acknowledge the finance adviser that finished my contract.  He was also very friendly and courteous.  I give both of your employees a 100.  Keep up the great work and great personality.",5.0

5,"May 03, 2019","Purchased a 2020 Kia Telluride. The whole process was very professional, low pressure, and very straight forward.  I got what I think was a very fair deal that I feel good about (have definitely had some opposite experiences. All the employees very friendly (and not in a creepy car dealership kind of way) helpful and presently the options clearly and openly. Whole process was easy and straight forward.  Only negative i can present was it took about an hour to get car washed and filled up.",5.0

10,"May 08, 2018","I've been a service customer of Casa Ford for many years but, not real impressed by my last visit.  Took my F-350 because the a/c started blowing hot air.  Told the service writer it was working fine when I shut off the truck but when I started it, it was hot air.  So it was something sudden.  They called and said the Freon was low and they serviced that and some other minor incidental repair.  Cost was going to be a little of $300.  Then later, they called and said when they went for a test drive the a/c was blowing hot air again.  Then they found the problem; a bad switch/contact.  The $300 was for nothing; it wasn't low on Freon because it was working fine when I shut off the truck the night before!  People are very friendly and helpful but, I was a little disappointed.",2.8

13,"July 26, 2017","Mike Rivera:  is awesome he takes care of us every time.  This was our 3rd car from Casa Ford.  When I just got off bankruptcy and had no credit for the last 7 years he was able to get us a truck it wasn't a Ford but it met my demands.  I wanted a crew cab and a bed liner and RWD + a small V-8. and white. Also got the wife a Ford Focus.  We kept it for a while but wanted something different and he found it a 2017 Ford Escape.  Now in truck month 2018.  I plan to trade my truck off for the Ford Truck I always wanted.  Plus I found out since I'm a life member of the DAV I also get a Xplan discount also.  So God Bless Mike is one of the Best.  My Dad said once a salesman almost his whole life.  To sell something with a good result, 1. you have to believe in your product, and 2. treat all customers with the same respect you would give yourself.  So I will see Casa Ford in February 2018",5.0
14,"June 26, 2017",Today we had to have our Electric throttle body replaced on our transit. Well Casa Ford in El Paso tried to pull a fast one on us by saying the job takes 2 hours. Needless to say when we were in California we had taken it to a mechanic and the man there removed it cleaned it off really good and did an oil change in less then 45 mins. My husband told the man at Ford that it only takes at the most 20 mins to replace ( 4 screws and very easy to get to) So he was like ok I'll charge you for only 1 hour of labor... I hate the feeling that a business is trying to screw you. Infact the last time we went to this Ford they forgot to put our oil cap back on. Needless to say never again will I ever go to Casa Ford again.,1.8

18,"October 03, 2016",Alex helped us out with the purchase of a new 2017 Explorer. We originally went in to see the Lincoln MKX and the Edge. Alex was very patient and allowed me to explore many options. He also got me a no hassle deal once I had decided to go with the explorer. He was thorough and explained all details about the vehicle without pushing. I know I got a great deal at Casa!,5.0

Yesterday you reminded me why I have always come back to Casa Ford, Great Service and sales agents willing to go above and beyond to help the customer.

23,"August 29, 2016",Finally a dealership that didn't make me feel uncomfortable about buying a vehicle. Mr. De la Torre is by far one of the best sales reps that I've had the opportunity to encounter. Whatever information I need or test drive he was able to answer every question I had.

25,"August 13, 2016","Our salesman, Michael Brucker, was fantastic. He was very patient and thorough. I never would have considered a Ford, but my husband drives them at work and suggested it. There is a disconnect with what one is promised online and on commercials in regards to monthly payments and the reality of the dealership. All was great except we left after 10:00 pm. Saturday night. The finances were the weakest link. By then, we were exhausted and the explanation of the finances were rushed. Michael Brucker was a 5 in all areas. The manager and finance department were 4s.",4.2
26,"July 31, 2016","I rarely write reviews, but I feel others need to be aware of this business and their unethical business tactics. Me and my wife stopped by Casa Ford on July 9th, 2016. The first salesman that approached me was a guy by the name of Roberto. He was friendly, which we admired, however, I got straight to the point. I told him what specific vehicle I wanted and gave him the VIN number which I got from the website. We haggled with the manager and finally told him I would agree with a higher payment.  In addition, we had a good trade-in and I was giving them a $1,000 down payment. Make a long story short, the deal didn't go through and we walked out without getting a new car. Upon looking at the salesman's paperwork where he started crunching numbers, it turns out they were trying to give us way below what our trade-in vehicle was worth. This was very upsetting, however, I gave them a chance.. The manager would not budge on the specific payment I wanted or the amount I wanted for my trade, even after I agreed to go with a higher payment. Big deal, me and my wife agreed to wait a little bit before looking at another dealership. Here's the main reason for writing this review and the reason I believe, in my opinion, that the dealership screwed up. Less than a week later, guess what? Roberto called my cell phone and asked if I had found a vehicle. I told him no. He said he had good news and to come in the dealership because they had new incentives. He called me my cell phone over the next several days, for a total of 4 times. I finally spoke to him and told him that the manager SHOULD HAVE settled for the specific monthly payment I was asking for. He said, ""I know,"" and said he had new promotions, incentives and discounts. I sounded too good to be true. He continued by saying he was close to closing the deal and getting me into my new car at the right price and payment. In the end, the manager finally contacted me and said he would look into it. I explained to him our current financial situation. He said he would have Roberto call me back. Roberto did not call me back. I figured if he has already harassed me several times, they must be willing to sell me the vehicle on my terms. Instead, Roberto sent me a lame text message which included a high monthly payment I couldn't afford. It was worse than before. First I must say, this is very unprofessional on his part and on the part of Casa Ford. Why not call me back and discuss this matter over the phone? I contacted the dealership and looked at their website and realized that there is NO new incentives or promotions. It was a lie. This dealership should re-train their salesmen and teach them to NOT give customers false hope, empty promises and lie about new incentives and promotions being available and telling customers, ""I have good news"", when in fact they do not. This is misleading and false advertisement. This guy was just desperate to make a sale. The point is, DON'T LIE to customers! Even after I walked out that first day, they called me several times, but never made an effort to get me into the vehicle I wanted. Once a customer walks out, don’t call them back unless you truly have good news and are willing to make a sale on that customer’s terms. If you can't do it, drop it, move on to the next customer. Very disappointing to say the least. Buyer beware.",1.3
27,"July 27, 2016","It was a good experience. Joe Colon is a good guy and it comes across in his dealings. He is the reason I have been doing business with Casa Ford for the past 9 years. While he does use Sales Techniques, I do not feel he is trying to out maneuver me.  Joe and Alex help me accomplish what I needed with the truck deal. Very good and professional TEAM!",5.0
28,"July 27, 2016","This dealership went above and beyond to make sure that I was taken care of. Joe ""Rocky"" Colõn did any and everything that he could to make sure that my wife and I got a truck that would suit our needs. Once my wife and I found the truck we wanted we were turned down for the loan for it by every bank. Mr. Alex Aguirre the F and I manager had to personally call the banks and finally after 5 days got me approved for a loan. Words can not express the hard work of these two individuals. Without them I would have had to get a used truck in mediocre condition and who knows when it would've gave out, but because of them I am now in a brand new Ford F150 with everything under warranty
 I can not thank these gentle man enough. Definitly recommend this dealership with special regards towards Joe and Mr. Alex.",5.0
29,"July 02, 2016","Check engine light came on on my under warranty F250 crew cab 4x4 that I bought at Casa Ford.
Made an appointment and dropped it off Monday morning. Didn't get it back till next Monday afternoon. 8 days. Everyday that I called they said Tomorrow. Then they charged me $100. to reprogram the computer-not covered under warranty-Duhh ? When they brought it out it was filthy dirty from being out in the rain and dust. I didn't even get 1 mile before the check engine light came on again. So I went back and they told me that I had to leave it again- another week ? No Thanks. 
Not the only Ford dealer in town.",1.5
30,"July 02, 2016","Joe ""Rocky"" Colon is everything you would want in a salesman, attentive, knowledgeable, going the extra mile to find solutions, outstanding customer service, was looking for refinancing my daughter's car and bought a new one for my son instead.

39,"April 18, 2016","Was lied to by Alex Aguirre regarding warranty I had when finalizing and signing contract for my car. I was in an accident and it was a total loss. I had been told that if I ever totaled it while paying it off, I would be given $5000 towards a new car at the dealership.

67,"October 01, 2015","I had found some information on your web site and was contacted by one of your reps. I told the person I would be there at 1030. When we arrived we were greeted and introduced to Pedro Rostro. We told him what we were looking for and by checking your inventory, there was five units that met our wishes and we chose one. I had a car to trade in, so while that was being evaluated we test drove the Escape. It fit the bill so we proceeded the purchase process. Pedro gave us his full attention and a satisfactory deal was made. We concluded the purchase later in the day. Fast, efficient, and friendly both by Pedro and the finance person. I have driven only Hondas since 2000, buying several here in El Paso. When I went to a Honda Dealer looking for one of their CRV,s they wouldn't give me a fair trade value for my car. and then the Salesperson blew us off and didn't return any phone calls made to him. As a result we are the proud owner of a Ford Escape. Thank you.

82,"April 06, 2015",Went to get my first car to casa Ford found. I told the salesperson I was a first time buyer and found a car I  liked but still told the salesperson that it was over budget. When I knew it I had it already. It was way overpriced and didn't explain the situation or process. I felt like I had been taken advantage of and wanted to talk to the managers about it. One yelled at me and tried to intimidate me saying I was basically screwed and had no option. I demanded to talk to another manager and he was condescending and passive aggressive towards me. I had to call my lawyer and got me out of there. Such a nightmare. It's the worst I have ever been treated. ,1.0

Not only was he demeaning to wife but he pulled his machismo line on her and treated us like we did not know a thing about anything and tried to sell us on some Smart Pay Plan which was complex at best and when we did not bite - the hard sale came on. 
Needless to say I had to hear about this all the way back to Las Cruces - who needs that right!
Deal was great but the Finance group was nearly a deal buster.  ",3.4

85,"March 02, 2015","They got me the car I wanted and I paid cash for it. Mustang GT. Salesman was OK. But when you get to the credit manager know that this is a Con that all dealers use to get some more money out of you for an extended or preferred warranty above the manufacturers warranty. The warranties may actually do some good for someone eventually but more likely to win the lottery. So decide if you want an additional warranty before you see a credit manager. He is not a credit manager, he is a con man with the sole desire to sell you something he would not buy himself. You will know when he is scamming you when he spends lots of time pushing buttons on the computer ( probably just messing around to kill time to make you wait), prints out long forms, (those are the warranty forms he has not sold you yet), sorts a whole bunch of papers in a file which are just a bunch of copies of the same couple pages. Then he messes with the computer again, then prints another form then sorts the papers again. All intended to waste your time and help his con game. The other part of the con is to tell you how many of the parts can fail. If that is true then buy a more reliable car. 
Suggestion, decide if you really want and additional warranty and tell the ""credit manager"" so he can explain it if you want it or tell him at the beginning you do not want it and if he trys to sell it to you, you will walk out and go somewhere else. Just be prepared and understand what you are getting into. 
This is common to any auto dealer. Good luck.",2.6

88,"October 07, 2014",My wife and I were visiting in El Paso when our car overheated. We just had the car in for service at our local dealer for this issue so we were not to happy. We pulled in on Saturday and were greeted by Sergio. He understood our dilemma and even though the service department was only opened for a few more hours he had his technician pull the car in for diagnosis. He called us a short time later and explained the problem. Another seal that was not previously replaced had failed causing the car to overheat and the overflow tank to crack. Parts were ordered and the car was repaired only to find additional leaks. Sergio and his team understood the distance we had driven from and wanted our car to be fixed right and were very thorough with the repairs. We were able to drive home the following week with no issues and are totally satisfied . Sergio and everyone at Casa Ford were super friendly and when we visit El Paso again I would not hesitate to use them again. ,4.8

They tell me that the truck is missfiring and for another 500 dollars they can fix it. The only problem is that it was running fine before I brought it in.  Also after paying $70 for parts and labor to mount my license plate they still didnt mount the front license plate. The tech mounted the bracket but left the license plate on my dash. After spending a total of $1200 I still had to go to a hardware store to buy bolts for my license plate.  I dont know why this place has such high ratings. My experience was terrible. ,1.2

Having had a truly terrible experience at the other dealerships, we found Casa Ford to be welcoming and professional. Our sales rep was Aaron, and he was so helpful and friendly. We walked in with a few specifications for the used car we wanted to buy (year, mileage, price, etc.) and he did his best to stick to those. As a first time car buyer, we were really nervous, especially after visiting other dealerships who tried to sell us cars way above our price range, or cars that I wouldn't trust to last more than 2 years. But Aaron put us at ease. He answered all our questions and gave us all the information we needed. We could also always reach him for more questions. We found our car almost immediately. We didn't have good credit and didn't know if financing this car was going to work out. However, they worked with us and got us a great deal which we never thought we could get. They were very professional but would also just sit and chat with us while we waited for the financing to go through. I felt truly welcomed in this dealership. The decorations were an added bonus!

There was never a time that we didn't feel like we were taken care of. I can't say enough how professional and friendly the staff is at Casa Ford. Even our finance manager, Alex Aguirre was great with us! We had some things that needed to be taken care of with our vehicle before we could pick it up and Ben made sure that our Explorer was in the best condition and confident that we would have no problems with it.

104,"March 20, 2013","As with others with negative comments about Casa...Everything was going great.  The car was picked out, price agreed on, cleaned and ready for delivery...UNTIL...the Finance manager stepped in.  My daughter and Johnny had agreed on a price for the car and everything was set.  She had her own loan but the finance guy wanted to try and run it through Ford and then added more money to the deal.  An agreed upon price Out The Door means just that.  When the finance guy started running more numbers at her, she asked for me to step in and help.  The agreed upon sales price was to include tax, title, and transfer fees but the finance guy was trying to add it onto the price at the end.  This may work for the young and naive person but not for those with the car buying experience.  Johnny was great at setting everything up and standing by his word until it came time to complete the deal.  After we disagreed on the numbers, he proceeded to tell us we got the wrong car that we agreed on.  We only looked at one car, ran our numbers on one car, and was trying to purchase that same car.  Where it came from was way out in left field and needless to say, we walked out very unsatisfied with his actions as a sales person and the finance guys.

Although I am an El Paso native, I call Manhattan, Kansas home now.  In 2002, I purchased my first Focus from Casa Ford and worked with Mr. Pena then as well. Even though I live in Kansas now and have Ford dealerships near where I live, I could not have imagined doing business with anyone but Ben Pena. 

Coordinating a car sale from almost 900 miles away is no easy feat.  Ben patiently worked with me every single step of the way to make my dream of getting my new car a reality.  I did not want to work with any other dealership or salesperson.  Ben Pena is one of a kind!  He cares and puts his customers first.  As a customer, you want to feel that you can whole-heartedly trust the dealership and the salesperson you are working with on a car purchase.  That is the reason why I wanted to work with Ben Pena again.  I never forgot the wonderful experience I had working with him ten years ago. He is not only trustworthy, but reliable and so incredibly personable. He is always available to answer any questions or concerns and always follows up with you.  That is a true salesperson! 

I truly felt like I had the red carpet laid out for me because Ben Pena did everything he could to get me the best deal and make the process go as smoothly as possible.  I will be forever grateful to Ben Pena and Casa Ford for their incredible patience and willingness to work with this former El Pasoan, now Kansas girl.  I will always work with Ben and Casa Ford on any future purchases.

150,"May 30, 2012","I contacted Casa Ford one night over the Internet with my preferences for a white Ford 150 XLT super crew truck. The following morning, Josh Sizemore called to verify my options. Within 15 minutes, he sent a photo of a white Ford 150 XLT super crew truck, a photo of the truck interior, a photo of the MSRP sticker listing all the options I requested, and a photo of the price quote. I drove to the dealership that afternoon to meet Josh  and the truck in person. I asked  Josh to drive the truck while I listened to him explain its features (truck will be used for business). Back at the dealership, Josh enumerated the discounts/incentives/rebates. I returned to the dealership the next day and bought my first Ford.

The Ford 150 is a great truck--it can practically sell itself. But not all dealers could sell it to me--5 others tried before I found Josh at Casa Ford and completed the purchase  36 hours after my first contact with him. Josh is pleasant and knowledgeable. He understood the truck I wanted and he understood that I was firm about the truck I wanted (think -- those other 5 dealers). I may have done all the research on the options, but Josh did all the ground work to locate the specific truck down to the very last option. In addition to the discounts/incentives/rebates that applied to my purchase, he qualified me for a military discount (my husband, the dealership honored all military for Memorial Day.) Then Josh delivered my new truck to my driveway.

Casa Ford is immaculate and the sales staff is friendly and professional. From the moment I was welcomed by the greeter, met with Josh, and finalized the purchase with the finance manager, I was treated as a knowledgeable and serious buyer. The next truck I buy -- business or otherwise -- will be from Josh Sizemore at Casa Ford.

171,"March 12, 2012","i have purchased 3 vehicles from Casa Ford within the last 6 months. I have refered family to Casa ford, and they also have purchased vehicles. Everyone is really cool there. No pressure like the other places. But,there is a down side on recent experience. 

i purchased a new truck, and a week later realized it was missing a piece of lighting. Went it to service, and waited two hours, just so they could tell me they had to order the part, to return back a week later. my frustration went through the roof. I shouldnt have had to deal with missing parts on a NEW TRUCK, let alone wait two hours, just to be advised that they don't have the part in stock. I work graveyards so sleep is a priveledge i cant pass up. 

Also on the same deal with the truck, finance and I discussed holding the downpayment on a post dated check, to be held 30 days. giving me the time, to come up with cash. Well, over the weekend i recieved a NSF notice from my bank, notifying me of a deposited check from Casa ford, and now have incurred the penalty fees. Real inconvenience!At time of posting this, discussion is still pending to see what happened with the check and the early deposit. 

Overall, i have been pleased with Casa ford. They work really hard to help out their customer. My salesman is highly enthusiastic of helping out his customers. on all of my purchases and my families, he has come through. There to answer any questions, even on his days off. Just these two recent clouds, have not allowed me to give them a full 5 star rating.  ",4.4

175,"February 10, 2012","I'm not one for writing reviews, but my car buying experience with Casa Ford Lincoln was so incredible that I must give credit where credit is due. Initially I contacted the dealership regarding a 2008 Ford Explorer (Eddie Bauer Limited Edition)I had seen on their website. I was in need of a well priced, reliable SUV that can transport my son's wheelchair. Well, not only did the SUV fit ALL of my needs, but my husband also ended up buying a new 2012 Ford Focus for work. Our salesman, Anthony Reyes, went above and beyond the call of duty. All of our questions were answered, we were able to test drive both vehicles at our leisure, features were explained to us in detail and when all was said and done we came in EXACTLY at our budget point. Mr. Reyes even ordered a pizza for us to enjoy while we sat and waited for finance and paperwork...now that's service!!! Within a day both vehicles were detailed, gassed up and delivered straight to our front door. My husband did realize (after the fact) that he had picked a car with no cruise control...how was this handled you ask? Well the dealership true to their motto 'The Nice Guys at Casa Ford' allowed him to pick another car of the lot---no penalty--no hassle...just a bit of additional paperwork and the difference in price.

No pressure whatsoever!!! Once I picked out the truck I wanted, he did everything he could to take care of me as a customer. I truly saw that I wasn't just another sale, I was Vito, and Vito wanted a truck. He even sacrificed a monthly milestonte by telling me to come back the next day to do the paperwork, even though it was the last day of the month, in an industry that is dominated by numbers.

Our appointment was at 6:30 pm and by 9 pm, we were driving away in a brand new car. 
Charlie's leadership and professionalism along with Octavio's patience, professionalism, and knowledge of his products made us feel like we were very important clients and felt comfortable with making the decision of committing to a new car. Alex Aguirre worked his magic in the finace department and did everything in his power to get us approved at an outstanding rate.

235,"July 23, 2011","My name is Melissa, and I would like to share my experience. This being the first vehicle purchase in a long time, I was nervous.  I went to the dealership with some financing in hand, and an idea of what I wanted, and the budget available to me.  Through online sales, I began ""window shopping"" the night before. Upon arrival, Mr. Robert Vitela introduced me to Mr. Raul Bustamante, who began talking to me about what I was looking for.  There wasn't any influence or persuasion of what he wanted to sell me, but more about what I wanted.  Mr. Bustamante showed me several, about five, possibilities as to what fit my wish list.  To be on the safe side, he even brought out the keys to those vehicles, should I wish to test drive any.  

When I saw my red Explorer in its space, I knew!  That test drive was so easy, and smooth.  All the questions I had about safety features for my two toddlers, technologies available to my teenage son, and mechanics of the engine for my husband were answered in a manner I could understand.  Once returning to the main building, Mr. Bustamante was sincere in asking what my thoughts were, not my husbands.  Once I said I had my decision, he mentioned options for financing.  Mr. Vitela, at this point came to check in on the process, and also proposed what Casa Ford could offer.

Needless to say, through their dedication to making the customer happy, the financing I brought to the table was not used, because Casa found me a better option, that was local. My experience with Mr. Bustamante was more than I could have expected.  The excitement of purchasing a vehicle was made pleasant, thanks to Mr. Bustamante.  ",4.8

254,"July 18, 2011","First off the the expierence I had at Casa Ford will be one to remember. Ive never felt as comfortable at a dealership as i did at Casa Ford. Josh Sizemore was our salesman and from first meeting him you couldnt help but like the guy, really down to earth and friendly. I didnt plan to buy anything that day or even that month i went there to just look at how they had changed the Explorer and was planning on buying another vehicle around September. Knowing that i expected the staff to really put me on stand by as I wasnt really a potential customer, not today anyway. But that didnt stop Josh from being the professional that he is, he took as much time as we needed showing us everything we asked. Never once  tried to push us to do anything that day. That was really so much different then what i expect at a dealership. The next day my wife and i decided we didnt have to wait until september we got ahold of Josh and started making plans for our next visit to bring home that Tuxedo Black Explorer he had showed us the day before, he made sure to grab the keys for us. Well we had our car picked out and ussually the next part was the most dreaded haggling with price and trade in and down payments the guys there made this so easy. The whle time  we were dealing with Josh and the rest of the staff there I felt like i was there only customer. Never once did i feel i was getting a bad deal or was being taken advantage of.

We were looking for a truck to fit a family of five, so he showed us a couple of trucks, and we advised him we were looking for something greatly priced and he showed us the trucks he had on sale, he even lent us one to see if that is what we were looking for. so we kept the truck the whole weekend, and were able to test drive the truck to make sure we like the truck. We went back on Monday and decided that we did not like the color, and he then showed us a F150 that was advertised $24950 for a 2011 V6 super crew. We test drove it and he explained the whole vehicle and we decided that this was the trcuk we needed for the family. We recently made a trip to San Antonio and I called Mr Rubio when we came back because the truck did AWESOME on gas. We drove it for 425 miles before we had to fill it up again. I have had many other vehicles and i must say that the Ford F150 that Mr. Rubio sold me was the best deal that I made in a long time and the price was super!!

262,"July 14, 2011","This is the third car I've bought from Joe and I'll keep buying from him as long as he's selling. From my very first visit, he did an excellent job of not acting like the typical sales person and actually made you feel like you've been friends for the longest time. That is exactly what's made it so easy to keep returning and buying more cars from him.

Joe goes out of his way to make sure you have the best experience possible when shopping for a car, and when you finally found the car of your dreams he works even more magic by getting you the price you need. I don't know how he does it but if you are just upfront with him, and don't play the haggle game, he will -- somehow -- get you the price you're most comfortable with.

Just because you've bought your car doesn't mean your time with Joe is over. He bakes you a chocolate cake! How awesome is that! If it wasn't cool enough that you just bought a nice car, he sweetens the deal (pun intended) with cake. 

Joe is a solid guy. You can't go wrong if you head over to Casa Ford to ask for his help specifically. 

Oh, and I almost forgot; the finance lady was also a huge help. I'm so sorry I forgot her name but I think it was Patsy. She helped me by finding money that I didn't know I had.

My dad and I intended to just start looking for a nice used car for my son who is graduating from high school and will start college in the fall.  We had stopped at 3 other dealers and were disappointed in what they had to offer.  We decided to try one last dealer and that was at Casa.  I am so glad we did.  We were greeted promptly by Vidal Casares.  He was friendly and took the time to find out exactly what we were looking for.  He showed us a couple of vehicles that fit our description and then we took a test drive and decided on the Ford Escape.  Everyone at Casa was friendly and made us feel welcomed.  Vidal and everyone else involved took the time to explain everything to me.  After I surprised my son with his car,  Vidal invited him back to explain all of the controls, etc. with my son.  I really appreciated that he took the time to do this.  It made my son feel like the car was actually his.  I highly recommend Vidal and Casa Ford to anyone looking to buy a car.  ",5.0

He showed me a few of the trucks, mentioned prices and options to think about.  He gave my friend and I time to look around to compare and see what I would be interested in without pressure on him to ""sell me the expensive one"".  Other than price only, he gave me lots of information about each truck so that I could make a good decision on my own.  My friend who is a mechanic, was impressed with his knowledge about the trucks and told me just about any truck would be a great choice.  I finally chose an awesome Ford F-150 and his help with the paperwork was great.  He was also able to get me a great trade-in price for my old truck that I had bought there 15 years ago!  Like they say, build Ford tough!  Ben was great and even called back later on to see how I was doing with my truck, twice!

We were uncomfortable not supporting our local dealerships in El Paso, TX and we called Casa Ford.  We spoke to Mr. Ventura ""Ben"" Pena.

Mr. Pena stayed in contact with us and within an hour we had purchased a 2010 Ford Fusion, sight unseen.  Upon returning to El Paso, on Monday, my wife and I closed the deal on the car. 

I use this experience as an example to teach my students the concept of relationship marketing.  Mr. Ben Pena went above and beyond what I perceive to be required of a salesperson.

We were looking at the new 2011 Ford Explorer and they had a few selections in stock although not a great selection since the vehicle is pretty much new to the market. Octavio did offer to find whatever color and combo we needed and did offer to work with us on whatever we wanted. We saw a black XLT and a Pearl Limited and we took it for a test drive.

AT THE PRESENT, I DRIVE A 2001 EXPLORER AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT, IT RIDES LIKE A NEW EXPLORER, THATS WHY I WOULD NEVER CHANGE MY MIND ABOUT DRIVING A FORD. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR HAVING SUCH HIGHLY EXPIRIENCED STAFF AND MANAGEMENT LIKE MR. ROBERT VITELA THAT MAKES YOU WANT TO BUY A FORD. ",5.0

I could not have been more impressed with the kindness and the professionalism that I encountered. Not to mention the price was spectacular!! I received such a great deal and I love CASA FORD. I only recommend them! They are the best!! Best SERVICE, best PRICES, best PEOPLE!!! Don't go anywhere else you'll be disappointed!! CASA FORD is the only place to buy. ",5.0
