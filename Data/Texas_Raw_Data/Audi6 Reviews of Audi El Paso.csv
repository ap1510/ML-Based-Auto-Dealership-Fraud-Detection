2,"September 05, 2018","""Worst Car Buying Experience Ever!"" 

Agreed to terms at 11 am sat in waiting room until 7 still didn’t finalize the paperwork. Had to go back 3 days later to sign. Gave a deposit and still haven’t received it back and it’s been a month. Do not buy here! Still can’t get a hold of the manager. Shady business. Will never buy a vehicle here again.
It's now been 3 months and my bank never recieved the title. I called to find out where it is and they informed me I need a vin inspection, either incompetent or don't care. I can't believe Audi Corporate would allow this type of business to be conducted under there name! Will never buy an Audi!

4,"January 21, 2018",I purchased a brand new Audi from Garcia Audi. since I've had that Audi every time I go in they have terrible service a lot of waiting and no information. Everyone there is very rude at Garcia Audi but the wife wanted an Audi. So disappointed with their performance. $1400 for 3 oil changes big rip off.,1.0
5,"February 08, 2012","Adrian was really helpful during my purchasing process, he was attentive and returned calls promptly. I didn't end up buying a car from this dealership as I chose a BMW over Audi, but I would definitely recommend Adrian if you're looking to buy a Audi in El Paso.",4.8
