0,"August 22, 2019","talk about low balling a trade in...
they gave me 5,000... 2 weeks later they sold it for 10,000

THEY SAID, truck is long bed ( market not wanted ).. gas engine  ( bad for local market ). 2 wheel drive ( bad for local market ).. high mileage is bad for a buyer to get a loan..

they added a $2,000 extra warranty without informing me.. till I questioned it.

oh 3 hours to receive a quote on trade in.. I asked for my keys 3 times.... 

in a few weeks.... 600 people in the gated park I live in, will return ( Winter Texans )..I will be talking

2,"April 16, 2017","Bought a 2017 Pilot for the wife's Christmas present.  First offer was for me to pay list price. Next offer was almost as bad,  Sales manager came out and insulted my offer.  We left.  E mailed General Manager, he accepted my offer.  Went back and picked up car.  F&I guy was trying hard, but was overwhelmed by paperwork.  We required handicap plates from a county in Texas, which we had on our trade in.  The Monday after Christmas we get a call saying they do not know how to do handicap plates.  OK, return the check we gave you for TTL and we will handle it.  No, we can not do that, we have to wait for it to clear the bank.  Took 15 days for our check to clear their bank???  Asked for MSO, title clerk is in the Chevy Dealership 15 miles away and she has not gotten deal yet.  Finally wife calls her, gets the paper work sorted out, they are going to bring the MSO and check to us, only they are wanting to keep $300+ for ""handling"".  Nope, I want all the money I gave you for TTL.  They issue a second check and the salesman brings it to our house.   What a cluster.  This is my 4th Honda vehicle, my first and only time with Gillman Honda.    Kinda bad when a couple of 70 year old folks know how to get a H/C plate and the title clerk does not.",1.6
3,"January 24, 2017","Our car broke down on vacation, but they worked us in, rushed our parts, shuttled us around, and bent over backwards to get us back on our way!  One word:  FANTASTIC!!!!",4.8
4,"December 21, 2015",Getting a car here was a mistake. I bought a Honda CRV and it shakes and their solution was to only put gas in the same location. They pushed all the warranties on us and they can't find the issue on my CRV. Can't wait for my income to get rid of the vehicle and find a better dealer.,1.6
5,"August 11, 2015",I had tried over 5 times to contact Finance Manager Javier Lozano for the past month.  I have left messages and no call backs.  Very very bad expirience.,1.4
6,"July 22, 2015","i had a sales named Richard smith, and mary de leon who pushes the extened warranty. they said they would send me a 50. referral fee for my son bought a 2015 Honda there and I had bought one in 2012. just that they lied to me. I will try clark knapp for my next Honda. love the Honda cars, just not this dealer. I am not impressed at all with these people.",1.4
7,"October 13, 2013","My wife and I went to look for a used car for her, I had already been speaking to Mr. Morado through email about going by. When we arrived my wife and I test drove multiple cars and she finally decided on the ford we purchased. When we got down to details mr Morado asked us to write down references, he then stated they don't have to be real people it's not like we're going to call them. Then he stated I had your car appraised while you were out on a test drive but I need you to sign this paper stating it's okay for me to appraise it. He then stated  I should have  had you sign this first but I do it at the end. That automatically raised concerns, but my wife wanted the car so I kept going with the process. Then Mr. Morado brought paperwork to show us the amount we were going to pay for the vehicle and the monthly payments. When he showed us the paper he circled an amount at the bottom and stated this monthly payment will be your worst case scenario. Then he stated now we are working on getting the interest rate lowered because of your car payoff history. When we saw the amount we were fine with it. Then we get to the finance manager Mrs. Deleon who by the way is the only reason we went through with the purchase. When we start talking terms the APR was 5% higher then our worst case scenario and the monthly payment was $50.00 higher then our WORST CASE SCENARIO!!!! Then before we finalized the whole deal I asked Mrs Deleon if our car was being washed and gased up like we were promised, she then called someone with the last named Romo and he said it was being taken care of. Well we get to our car and GUESS WHAT!!!!! NO FULL TANK OF GAS CAR HAD NOT BEEN WASHED!!! ALL THE xxxxxxxx WE HEAR ON COMMERCIALS ABOUT THE GILLMAN RULE AND YOUR EMPLOYEES CANT EVEN FOLLOW THROUGH WITH THERE PROMISES. OH AND ONE MORE THING WHEN I TEST DROVE THE FORD THE ENGINE LIGHT WAS ON AND I ASKED MR. MORADO TO FIX IT, AND GUESS WHAT!!!! IT WAS NOT TAKEN CARE OF!!!!",1.0
8,"March 31, 2013","I gave a rating of very bad on customer service because ultimately Gillman Honda chose to loose a customer for life.  I purchased a used vehicle, and an extended warranty.  My original contact Steve (sales rep) was awesome! Great guy, great customer service.  Within minutes of driving my vehicle off the lot, it started making a grinding noise in the front end. I got home inspected noise. The dust cover on right front brake was bent rubbing on disk brake. (I bent dust cover back, problem solved, no harm no foul).  That very evening the vehicle started making a whole new noise under the front end, embarrising Loud squeak under front end going over bombs and turns. I took back to Gillman, service manager was nice. The noise disappeared, they couldn't find anything wrong. I was perplexed as they were.  That night noise came back with a vengeance, I took back to Gillman.  They heard it this time.  Long story short, I brought it back three times with same problem. I was told by the service manager it would be to expensive to take apart to find the problem. They just kept spraying it with lube in hopes it would go away. Warranty doesn't cover nuesence squeaks I was told many times.  My problem made it to General manager, great guy, great customer service, he gave me rent car until they figured out the problem.  I thought finally we are going to get it fixed.  Nope!  He was singing same tune as service manager, there is no safety issue with the truck and warranty does not cover my problem, (except no one really knows what the problem is and it is to exspensive to figure it out). I'm done with Gillman!  I took my vehicle to a specialty shop, they found problem within minutes, dried out lower ball joint.  They cleaned it up with WD40 and some penetrating oil.  $97.00 easy!!!!!  I am going to replace both upper and Lowe ball joints for good measure. About $1,000.00 for pease of mind easy money.  Gillman, clearly doesn't understand the importance of customer loyalty, my wife needs a new car and my three boys will be needing cars in the future. Life time customer lost for a measly $97.00 repair.",3.0
9,"March 03, 2012","San Benito Honda dealer personnel treated us with absolute respect, while in the parking lot by Mr. Alvarado and in the lobby by Mr. Jeff Peters. Ms Vasques helped us by  accommodating our payment obligations. 
After given the opportunity to test our selected  vehicles; Sergio Alvarado presented, and displayed himself as a professional salesman.  Mr. Alvarado assisted us throughout the selection, demonstration, test drive and financial process. Mrs. Noelia Vasques possesses an outstanding knowledge, experience, and financial skills to provide us with the best financial opportunity we deserved from financial lenders. Mr Peters gave us his personal attention while waiting. 
We respectfully recommend Gillman Honda dealership of San Benito Texas to whomever wishes to experience excellent service and their preferred Honda automobile.
We thank everyone involved in acquiring our new 2012 Honda Accord!

10,"January 24, 2012",Great sales staff! They were very patient and search high and low for my perfect vehicle. They were always available. My family has bought from them several times in the past. This was my first purchase with Gillman (San Benito). It won't be my last. Thank you!,4.8
11,"November 10, 2011","Great Customer Service! Great Deals! The salesman was excellent didn't rush me, or push me, into anything I didn't want. He gave me the opportunity to test drive other vehicles and was patient with me as I decided. ",5.0
12,"October 18, 2011",Mr. Juarez took care of us in a professional and caring manner. He has expertise in his product sales pitch yet he did not come on to strong or pushy. Nice young man and an asset to the Gillman Honda dealership. My wife Lucila is looking forward to a long and happy experience with her new CRV.,5.0
13,"October 16, 2011","Very, very nice sales manager and salesman.........did their best to get me the deal I needed.  Joe went over the entire car features with me.  I enjoy my vehicle immensely.  I would definitely recommend this dealership.  They were fast with the paperwork, no waiting.  I like the lease program, 3 years only.  Also, want to thank Hershel Zinn of Gillman Chevrolet as he has been my sales rep for years.  Wonderful staff.",5.0
14,"October 09, 2011","This dealership was very honest, friendly, clean, professional, and well stocked with inventory. I would recommend this place to everyone! I'm glad to say I'm a Gillman Girl!!!",5.0
15,"September 12, 2011","We had a pleasant experience with our sales man and felt no pressure during the entire sales process. Even when the color that we wanted was not available Sergio went out of his way to find out what exactly was coming in. We ordered a car, and received it faster than the projected time it was to arrive. I bought my first Honda at this dealership 11 years ago and I was pleasantly surprised the helpful and courteous salesman haven't changed one bit. We will recommend  our family and friends to Sergio and look forward to the purchase of another Honda for our growing family.",5.0
16,"September 04, 2011",My husband and I were looking to purchase a 2011 Honda Pilot we went to Gillman hoping to be taken care of locally being that we are from San Benito and left very unsatisfied.  Jeff Peters the floor manager was very RUDE and RACIST towards us we left feeling extremely uncomfortable and violated. I would NEVER recommend this dealership to anyone!!!  We ended up buying our Pilot In Laredo where they know about customer service.,1.4
17,"August 24, 2011","The whole buying experience was excellent!  Jeff Peters and Joe Kolniak went above and beyond to make my wife and I as comfortable as possible and the deal was very smooth!
