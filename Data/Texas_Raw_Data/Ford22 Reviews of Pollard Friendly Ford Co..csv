1,"June 22, 2019","Brought my car. Two days later and still sitting. The said they don’t work on Saturday but when we came to get it, they were open and working. Man on the phone was a little rude. I won’t go back.",1.2
2,"June 21, 2019","I purchased a vehicle from Pollard Friendly Ford in February of 2019 and in April there was a hail storm that cause damage to where this vehicle was considered a total loss from my insurance company. While dealing with this I spoke with the bank (Amarillo National Bank in Lubbock) and was informed that I would need to cancel my ""extended warranty"" which I knew nothing about and was not informed of at the time of purchasing this vehicle. I immediately called the dealership and spoke with Richard McDaniel- he told me that I needed to email him a statement of total loss from the insurance company and my address to forward the check from the warranty company. Richard did inform me that it would take 4-6 weeks before I got my check and didn't seem thrilled that it would be getting cancelled. I spoke with him on 05/18/2019 at which time I immediately sent the required documents, so over the next 3 weeks I called Richard several times and left 2 voicemails. 1 month passes and I decide to call to the warranty company to check if the policy had been cancelled. No they inform me that it is still ACTIVE and there have been no attempts to cancel it at that time. I call Pollard Friendly Ford and leave a message for the dealerships General Manager Tyler Terry, he called me back the same day (which seemed at the time promising) Tyler told me that he was sorry that he would speak with Richard and that due to the situation that he would see about expediting the refund of the warranty. Today 06/21/2019 (2 months after the car was deemed a total loss) I myself spoke with the warranty company and had to go back and forth with emailing documents and submitting forms I FINALLY got the policy cancelled and they are now issuing a refund check to the dealership. The people at this dealership all the way up to the General Manager are a joke and a nightmare to deal with, they lie and do not follow through with what they say if it is going to cost them their commission. They should call them ""Pollard UN-Friendly Ford"" because of the lack of care and lack of customer service that they offer- they only care about the almighty dollar and if you are no longer a profit for them they discount you completely and toss you aside because they need to focus on their next victim! DON'T BUY FROM THIS DEALERSHIP, you will regret it and also in the long run pay $$ ",1.0

4,"January 26, 2019","Brought in 2011 ford fusion for airbag recall, when I picked up the vehicle. A/C and heater not working, bring car back to svc dept. No hot air for heater and air only works from defrost mode...very frustrating. When asked what the problem was with no a/c od heater, was told something came disconnected....very informative......very frustrated! Just got the fusion back....again, the technicia named Bryan explained the problem as folliws..""I guess the car just got mad, cause when I plugged the controls back in, it was working...i guess the car got mad""....really, I asked how does a car get mad...he utters I dont know, cause it was working, it's ok now.....if you bring your vehicle to pollard good luck with these unprofessional idiots.",1.0
5,"December 27, 2018","Purchased a $50,000 vehicle from the lot @ Indiana & the loop, the sales staff was absolutely terrible. Would definitely recommend not dealing with this dealership. The sales manager, finance manager along with the parts department had zero clue about dealing with people other than making the sale & pushing the warranty & scare tactics that eventually raises the price of their vehicles. BUYER BEWARE !! ",1.0
6,"December 13, 2018"," I have a 2016 f150 that I have bought here at pollard and it’s had a problem with the power steering since the truck had 30,000 miles the problem is that the power steering system is  very weak causing it to pull to the sides very bad, I have brought it to the dealer to get repaired  since it was under factory warranty and the dealer made pay for an alignment out of my pocket so I did but that didn’t fix the problem they also left my steering wheel crooked and i told them about it and I brought the truck again but they didn’t fix it they didn’t even fix the crooked steering wheel they left it the same I also told them about the weak power steering system but they refuse to fix it they said there was nothing wrong with it, I told them to let me know whe were going to test drive it so I can go with the tech and shown him what the truck was doing  but every time they test drive it they never let me know. The truck already has over 36,000miles and I’m out of warranty they won’t even look at it now, i took the truck to Sewell Chevrolet in Andrews Texas and they charge me 180 dollars but the straightened my steering wheel. I have all my invoices in case anyone from pollard ford reads this I’m writing this because I’m very sad at what y’all do to people, this trucks aren’t cheap, that steering system should of gotten replaced by the ford warranty and now it’s gonna have to come out of my pocket I don’t know how y’all can sleep at night I was a ford guy all my life until now I hate ford and I will never come back to this dealer and I will never buy another ford in my life",1.0
7,"October 30, 2018","I wouldjust recommend this dealership or their partners to anyone. After a year of having a vehicle purchased from this dealership, I have spent well over $8000 in repairs. This price does not include what the extended warrantyhas covered. Go literally anywhere else. ",1.0
8,"October 06, 2018",Took my explorer in due to mechanical issues.  Was told warranty would cover the repairs but that the part needed to be ordered.  Guy told me that he would call me as soon as the part arrived.  It has been over 6 months and I still haven't heard anything.  I called and asked what the status was.  This guy told me he would check into it and call me.  7 hours later and I still haven't heard anything.,1.4
9,"August 14, 2018","We will NEVER do business with Pollard Friendly Ford in Lubbock, TX again!! After having a Ford remanufactured engine installed BY FORD, they are refusing to honor the 3 year warranty that was purched with it. Not only are they not honoring the warranty but are charging us $300+ for the diagnostics that was run for NOTHING! As you can see, we run A LOT of Ford vehicles and this has put a VERY BAD taste in my mouth for them. I cant stand to run a bowtie on the front of my trucks either so I guess Toyota will be getting more business from us. This really upsets me because I have always been a big Ford supporter. I called Ford customer service and they said that they couldn't intervene because the dealerships are privately owned. Needless to say, I am absolutely disgusted and feel the need to inform others of their poor service standards.

10,"March 04, 2018","I bought a car from Pollard off of Q 7 years ago! I needed a gas saver to commute back and forth to work in. I was pleased to run into Lawson and get all things I requested without the ""fluff"" and the going back and forth. I was able to get a car I have always wanted, an amazing payment, and a warranty also!! Pollard is just as good as they were 7 years ago!!",5.0

12,"December 15, 2017","Ashley was great! He was so helpful and patient with me and I truly appreciate it. He did a wonderful job helping me look and go over all of the different options. Also he was sweet enough to deliver my car to me! The is Ash, you are great! I love that it's fully loaded with great features! My car buying experience, at Pollard was amazing, the Pollard family went above and beyond to meet all my needs!.",5.0
13,"September 17, 2017","Kept my car 3 days to run a diagnostic, change the battery and oil change---unacceptable.  Price $311---unacceptable. Left vacuum hose off (either careless or hoped I would have to bring back so they could gouge me again)---unacceptable!!  If this is what Ford has to offer, you can bet my next new car won't be a Ford!!",1.0
14,"April 16, 2015","Salesman Garcia told me he couldn't get me financed within 5 minutes.  I went to another dealer in Dallas and they got me financed within an hour.  The difference of two dealerships 'one they didn't work for me"" and ""one that went out of their way to get me financed""",2.2
15,"October 18, 2014","Well the first salesman was nice and friendly. I found a truck I wanted and he told me he thought he could do something to make it work. I told him it was ok if he couldn't get it in my price range. I wasn't expecting him to be able to do that. He told me my 08 Tundra would be a nice trade in and he really thought he could do something. He told me to take the truck for a good test drive so I did.  When I got back an other salesman came out and said the first salesman was working on an other deal and he would take over. We went in his office and I was told (not exactly in these words) my truck wasn't worth what I owed on it and if I couldn't pay at least 500 a month I couldn't afford that truck...how can I argue with him, I do owe around 9 grand but every where else I have looked as offered me a descent  trade in. Now I really wasn't expecting to be able to afford it. It was how I was handled and the attitude. .. check other dealerships most have good and not so good salesmen but find a good one to deal with. Vehicles cost alot of money to have to put up with that. ",1.3
16,"March 09, 2013",Ran into car problems returning home from CO - service was great - earlier than expected and less than quoted. Friendly helpful staff including driver Kevin ODonald.,4.6
17,"November 12, 2012",I will never buy a Ford after my experience here. The people were all great until it came to questions on why my car was making noises with in 1 day of me driving it off the lot the car had damage on the inside that they had said they would fix and I look under the steering wheel its duct taped and electrical tape its a shame ,1.0
18,"August 12, 2012","when I first arrived at the dealership everything was great I was looking at a 2013 new mustang the sales man was very knowledgeable about the car and was very nice i bought the car that night. 
the next day I went in to have it detailed (washed and interior cleaned)there was not much to do as it was a new car.
the sales guy gave me a ride to my house and about 3 hrs later came back to give me my new mustang the outside was spotless tires were wiped down it looked really nice. he gave me the keys and went on his way.
 after about 30 I remembered he had not shown me any thing about how the car worked I.E. the radio the sync system how to set the clock how to make a phone call while in the car?
I drove back to the dealership and ask him how this stuff worked he was nice enough to show me.
I then ask him why was there dust every where on the inside of the car if they just had it cleaned &quot;HE SAY'S SORRY FOR YOU BAD LUCK ITS WAS NOT MY JOB!!&quot; FOR A NEW CAR YA I JUST DON'T THINK SO.. 
I just bought a new $28,000 from your dealership and u delivered it done half done if I was him I would have detail do it over an apologized. I did not even get that...",2.6
19,"October 17, 2011",I recommend you go elsewhere for service.  The parts and price are less priced at comprisable ford dealers.  The dealer wasn't honest with the pricing and service.  I suggest spending your money at other dealers.  Don't waste your time at 'Friendly' ford dealer. ,1.2
20,"April 05, 2010","I took my truck into Pollard Ford because a previous repair done by another Ford dealer left the transmission over-filled.
Pollard Ford service department had my truck all day to drain the transmission down to the proper level.
The service advisor called me and told me the transmission tail-shaft seal was leaking and it would be about $150 (over one hour labor) to replace it. I declined.
I got my truck home and found that the transmission was still overfilled! Pollard Ford charged the previous Ford dealer to drain the transmission which they didnt do!
To add insult to injury I replaced the seal myself, working without a lift and air tools, in 35 minutes!
