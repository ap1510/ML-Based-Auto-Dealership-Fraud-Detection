5,"May 13, 2020","I have NEVER had a better experience with a dealership! I work for a financial institution and deal with countless dealerships on a daily basis. Most dealerships are sly and dishonest, but not these guys. I worked with Beto, who was an awesome salesmen. My husband and I were driving in from Houston, TX for a particular vehicle, and I was able to make the deal via text/email. Him and his manager, Tom, made everything as seamless as possible. Even their financing department was a pleasure to work with! We had good vibes all the way around. I highly recommend this dealership. ",5.0

54,"February 15, 2015","The worst experience I've ever had and I've purchased over 20 new vehicles in the last 40 years.  I just brought a new 2015 F-150 Platinum Edition and am having some problems with the 4x4 and a front end collision warning system.  I called my salesman as usual (lots of problems with the dealership prior to this latest problem) and was basically told, ""I don't really know what to tell you because we don't provide a loaner and our shop is small and unprepared - maybe we will be better when we move across the expressway.""  My 2015 F-150 is being repaired at Boggus Ford in McAllen.  This place can best be described as ""disgusting.""
