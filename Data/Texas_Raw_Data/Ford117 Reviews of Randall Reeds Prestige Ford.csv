1,"June 19, 2020","Dealership allowed people to make appointments to buy a car after driving a model to my home to help me make my decision.  Safety during the pandemic was considered with masks and limited interaction with others,  Allowed me to make the best decision on what car I wanted, what would be the best financing decision and whether it would be better through my credit union or Ford credit.  Greg Lusk was very helpful and open throughout the whole process and made sure I would be happy with not only the car but also the price.",5.0

3,"June 16, 2020","We made the drive to Dallas from Wichita for a particular car 2019 Taurus as we had a 2014 and really liked it and knew that 2019 was the last year for it to be made. All the staff we talked with were knowledgeable and friendly. Our sales contact was Joe and he communicated with me by email, text, and phone during the week long process. The only thing i was slightly disappointed with was the amount given to me for my trade. I think it was off by about $1000. Also, when I tried to use my Farm Bureau $500 credit, they said it could not be used because of the ""credit"" Ford had given them to mark down the Taurus. I still think this is wrong. But, as far as the overall experience, I would count it as very good, and would not have a problem visiting them again. I have had numerous questions after the purchase and they have been quick to try and get me the answers and to satisfy me. ",5.0

5,"June 15, 2020","The absolute worst experience i’ve ever had with any dealership. They don’t do anything to work with you or fix anything you need. I will never go back to Prestige. They had my car for TWO months and never fixed it. Fixed it long enough to finally get it home and as soon as I got home it stopped running again. Also, when you reach out to the managers they flip blame on you instead of working with you to fix the issue and take responsibility for what they did. My car ended up in worse condition than when I took it to them to begin with. I’m disgusted with the way they conduct business. ",1.0

8,"June 08, 2020","I have been taking my F-250 to prestigue ford since it was new in 2012 - and always had excellent service.

About 6 months ago - had an issue, and the end results were not very favorable in both the service and how the situation was handled... this was a one off situation out of probably 20-30 trips for regular service. 

Seemed like there was a stint of some turnover in the service department. 

Anyway - a bit reluctant to use them for this job... - however, I took the chance - and Lee T. (service advisor) did a good job on communication, handled himself very professionally, and so far just a few days after getting the truck back I have zero issues. 

Truck was cleaned, which was a plus.

Note - I gave a five start on the price - as it was about the average for the type of work... although more than I would have wanted to pay - we did work through the needed service and walked away feeling ok.

Anyway, I feel that if Lee is around for my future service visits - I will once again put some trust into the service department. 

Good Job Lee! Thank You!",5.0
9,"June 08, 2020","I had a problem that could have been, in my mind, serious and expensive. I took it to  old reliable  Rick  Ziulek.  He and  guys back in the cave looked at it and determined that it was not serious and would work it self out with some driving. A great opportunity presented itself  to take advantage of me  but  honesty and integrity prevailed. This is why I go to Randall Reed.  ",5.0

Everything so far has been handled efficiently and with attention to detail.  He was outside when we pulled up and addressed us by name (we had never met him before).  Customer service is sadly lacking in many industries lately, but not so with Sean.  Purchasing a vehicle is one thing, what keeps you coming back is the care afterwards.

I replied my credit is bad I’m 10 gs upside down and don’t have a down payment and want to pay around 400 for a truck. They said they can work with me. Lie! after saying they won’t run my credit until they can get me where I need to be B.S! They ran both my wife’s credit and mine. Then come at me with a 6 to 700 dollar payment.

I have been a Ford customer for over 9 years since 2012 and have never experienced  anything like I did today!! I dropped my car off at 06:35 this morning with a problem with my battery,  my car was hesitating on yesterday and would not starting this morning after sitting overnight.  I filled out the envelope and left the key for my car to be checked out. 

Well I got my first call on or around 07:18 this morning regarding what was going with my car! I explained what was happening and he stated he would have it checked out and give me a call. Well after several calls and no call back. I finally got a call back at after I left a message for him to call me. He called me at 1:36 PM stating It may be a connection problem he was not sure but they would to do a clean-up for 29.95, which it ended up costing me $39.95 and he stated  I also needed a new battery for $179.00 which was what all of Ford battery cost, which is not true, not on line anyway. Well at this point I told him just don’t do anything I was going to pick up my car, well he stated they had already did the oil change that I had requested and rotated my tires which was not listed on the invoice, so I am not sure if he rotated the tires or not. Well after picking up my car I took it somewhere and they tested the battery and stated it was not a problem. (How) could this be? Your person quoted me a price of $215.00 for the battery and the clean up!!!! Which I had had the same problem with a Ford battery leaking and that corroded and they replaced the battery,  but he would not even offer any type of credit. It is not my fault the batteries both were faulty.  I have always loved the service provided at Ford it was 100% great customer service but after today I am not sure if it was because I was a female or black!! Not sure!! And I was in the market for a new car but FORD, now not sure anymore. One bad customer service person can cause you to loss a customer. 

This was the worst service experience I have ever had!! Service so without any customer service training!!! Still having the same problem with my car!!

advisor, Jeff Hoening! His professionalism and knowledge are at the top of the charts but its his one-on-one when I walk into the service area. Friendly, always has a smile of his face. And the fact that he doesn't take me to the bank. I never feel pressured about getting things done to my car. 

I will continue to come back because of Jeff!!!!!

Greg Lusk and Terrance Harkey were great. While Greg worked hard to find the best deal available for us, Terrance walked us through every bell and whistle on our new Expedition Limited Max. We left the dealership confident that we had gotten the best deal possible and the best service program that fit our needs. A NO-PRESSURE approach made it a pleasant experience. In addition to the sales team, the service department is outstanding as well. It's hard to find an honest car sales and service business (I have had experience with the worst) but when you do, you'll keep going back. Thanks again Greg & Terrance. You're the BEST.

59,"July 26, 2019","My car has a brake issue but it is not consistent.  It was due for an oil change which they have been doing since I moved to Dallas 4 years ago on this car (a Ford dealer has ALWAYS worked on my car).  My husband also told me I needed 2 new tires. They first told me I needed 4 in which we had to tell them to go back and re-check.  Turns out we were right.  On the brake side they couldn't find it at first and then said they think they found it and saw fluid leaking.  They quoted me $1300.  My husband is mechanically inclined and said he would change out the master cylinder and brake booster at home.  He did so with a Formula 1 racecar mechanic.  Both confirmed that neither the master cylinder OR brake booster were leaking and had no issues. Essentially, I would have paid $1300 for something that does not exist and would still have the issue I did.  Since I am a regular customer, including my F350 that goes in, and have been loyal to them for almost 5 years, this, in my opinion, was inexcusable.  And no apology or willingness to make it right has occured.",2.4

87,"June 10, 2018","I scheduled an appointment online. I was never contacted to confirm the appointment.
I scheduled an appointment for a first oil change from a vehicle I purchased from this dealership, which was paid in full. I also scheduled for a windshield replacement. 
Service providers had no idea why I was there, who was scheduled to help me, and could not help replace the windshield.
I work at night, which means getting an appointment during a time I am awake is challenging. 
Having arrived at a prearranged time, where workers are not aware I am arriving, cannot help me with an issue, and did not let me know that they couldn't help me fix and issue is incredibly upsetting. 
I accepted the oil change without the windshield replacement. This service took about an hour, which is what i would expect from a dealership. The service person was nice and apologetic about not being able to help with the windshield. 
I was later called by phone the same day, unsolicited, to rate the service I was provided a previous day. I had no service the previous day. The caller seemed unaware that the service was provided the same day. This call interrupted my sleep as I work at night. 

I cannot express how deeply, incredibly deeply, disappointed in the service I've received at this dealership. I attempted service in person before the date I scheduled service and was told there would be a 3 hour wait minimum.  This is the second vehicle I have purchased. I will not be purchasing another from this dealership. I will be actively discouraging those that I know, and come across from making any vehicle purchases or service from this location. Any aftermarket alterations that I need or other that I know may desire, I will directing to any other location. This experience has been wholly unacceptable. ",3.0

89,"October 13, 2017","This dealer's service center is the worst, most awful service.  We took our F350 in for repairs FIVE WEEKS AGO and they STILL do not have it put back together or running.  Mr. Sheldon Mabry is completely evasive and unhelpful.  The has NO sense of DEPENDABILITY, reliability, or trustworthiness at all.  He says he will check and call you back and in 5 weeks, he's NEVER called back.  Whenever we finally talk to someone, they say 'we fixed the first problem, but now you need to fix this.'  They tell us, 'It will certainly be drivable after you replace this one more part.'  How many times has this happened?  The price keeps going up past the value of the truck and it still is not drivable. 

We believe that this is not a service center, but a rip-off center.  We feel this way because they have been unreasonable, untruthful, and unwilling to work with us concerning options.  They do not really care about the customers.  This is the WORST dealership service center we've ever seen anywhere.  We can say this because we have also had service at Rusty Wallis Volkswagen, Town East Ford, and Don Davis Ford as a comparison.",1.0

The service is just horrible! I would call and leave messages with people as well as voicemails and I would never get a call back, their excuse would always be ""our phone don't always work"" which is funny because if you are a place of business then why would you not have phones that work! The advisor I was assigned could not be more rude! She would never call me back despite multiple calls and messages and never knew the status of my car properly. I would always get ""let me check I'm not sure when it will be ready, I don't know the status, etc"". I requested to speak to the manager/director and I left messages with him as well and I never received a phone call. I had to pull strings and get in contact with old friends to finally lite a fire under their xxxxx. I took my car to Ford thinking they would be more professional and prompt and I was clearly mistaken! If you have the choice to take your car elsewhere, please do!!! I'm sure service king would've had my car ready within a couple of weeks not over a month. WORST PLACE EVER!

I have since received my car and it could not have been worse. My cars rim was missing the ""Ford"" cap in the middle, my drivers door was missing the key cap, and I had a HUGE BLACK STAIN on my drivers seat and the worst part is that my interior is beige. The most unbelievable part about the whole thing as we is that the advisor accused me of losing the key cap and did not even mention the missing rim cap or the stain in hopes that I would not notice I assume, and she blamed me about losing the caps saying that ""that was the way we received the car"" etc making me feel as though it was my fault they were missing instead of saying ""I'm not sure let me get the techs to investigate, etc"" because guess what, 10 minutes later they magically found it in my car. Which there was no way I could've put it there since they have had my car for over a month. The battery was also not working and they had to switch it and I just pray that the ""new"" battery does not go bad on me as well. 

I have attached photos of how I was returned my car. I cannot express how disappointed I am. I have been calling to speak to ""the director"" many times and the only thing I received back was another phone call from the advisor not the manager I requested and she said ""Ryan asked me to give you a call back he is currently unavailable"" WOW just great customer service. I asked to speak to the person above him and there was no answer I left another message but at this point I honesty do not think anybody there cares.

92,"August 22, 2017","I found the truck online the day it was posted and contacted the sales team that I was very interested. They sent me photographs of the truck invited me to see the truck so I took time from work and skipped lunch to go buy it, pen in hand.  Something was fishy because I drove all over the lot and the truck was MIA. Joe Ritmo sat me down at his desk and casually strolled to the back of house area for some time. When he finally returned he told me the truck actually wasn't at the dealer or even in their possession.  I was very upset and humiliated so all I asked was for the expectation to be set as to when I could buy the truck. Joe then disappeared to the back again. After another fifteen minutes I got up and went looking for him because they are either going to get me in the truck or they aren't. When I finally found him he sat me down with what i was told was his manager, Omar, and they apologized and promised they would get the truck very soon and bring it to me for a test drive at my work. A week went by and nobody bothered to contact me. I call Joe the following week at 9am and he said they had a meeting and he could update me on the status shortly after. He never called me back. I left numerous voicemails for Omar and he never contacted me. I was calling Omar to tell him that Joe was not communicating what was happening and I wanted a new salesperson to help me. So now the sales team and the management team have provide to be poor communicators. Joe always said (texted) he would get back with me shortly and days would go by. At this point it was almost 2 weeks into me trying to buy it. The daily updates never came, detailed voicemails were never returned, and I was severely disappointed in their communication disability. How can you leave someone hanging who is proactively trying to buy a $30k vehicle. Every other dealership in the area I inquired with worked super hard to earn my business and these lazy sales guys can't pick up the phone like an adult and handle their business.

102,"July 31, 2013","This dealership Prestige Ford, had an F-150 that was the exact truck that I had been looking for. It had every option and was equipped as if I had ordered it myself. My only problem was the price which was being advertised as $35,132.00 with a Ford Customer Cash Rebate thru July 31,2013 of $3500.00. I just thought it might be more than I should spend even with the discounts, but without the advertised incentives and rebates it was certainly a no. So I continued to struggle with the decision for three weeks. Looking at the truck nearly every day on the dealership's website. After carefully weighing out all the factors I came to a decision.
I decided to buy the truck and called the dealership only to learn from the sales person that the pricing on that truck was incorrect (bear in mind, I had been looking at this truck on the internet for three weeks at this price)  an the truck would be $3000.00 more due to the fact that the dealership had installed ""add ons""  and I think mentioned something about wheels but had somehow not adjusted the price to reflect these extras. Bottom line, the price went from $35,132.00 to $ 38,132.00 while I was on the phone, with the sales person. The next day I called the General Manager of the dealership to tell him that I thought that they should honor the price they had been advertising for weeks! He told me he would check into it and call me back and he didn't. 
I addition, did I mention that I have already bought one truck from this dealership and was a returning customer? 
Not only is it bad business to have your customer feel like he's been the victim of some type of bait and switch scam, I do believe it is illegal. One other thing about the situation, I have spoken to a salesman, the assistant GM and the GM and not one of these people has said to me ""I am sorry for this mess and we will do everything we can to make it right for you"". Seems to me that is what ""customer service"" should be all about.

105,"September 26, 2012","After a rear end collision, I took my Ford Focus into the service center to have it fixed. The car was running fine before getting it fixed. The collision just caused the rear end bumper to be damaged as well as the reverse lights. I took my car to the dealership because I felt that it was the safest and most reliable place to get my car fixed. 

Within 24 hours of getting my car back, the battery died. I thought nothing of it and had it replaced for free since it was under a warranty. But the car had been a little slow to start since I got it back. I honestly thought nothing of it until today when it didn't want to start. I took it to the Auto Zone down the street and had a system check done on the car. The starter was bad. The mechanic who looked at the car said that the starter looked old. Well, I had to have my car running and paid to get the car fixed, the starter replaced.  But, when the mechanic replaced the part, they showed me that the starter was not the original factory part, but was from a junkyard.  It was clear that the part was from the junkyard because it was marked with the junkyard marking system, was much older than the car itself, and did not have the Ford logo on it like all of the other factory parts. 

I bought the car NEW from Ford. I am the first and original owner. No one has owned the car except me. I have NEVER EVER had the starter replaced before. The original factory starter should have been in the car. Obviously, one of the mechanics working at the dealership in the service department switched out my starter with one from the junkyard. I have never ever heard of this happening before and am shocked and outraged that such an event would even occur. I am also concerned for everyone else who has gone there and who might in the future who may unknowingly encounter this mechanic.

109,"November 02, 2011","When searching Edmunds for used cars, I saw an advertisement for a 2001 Audi TT coupe that I was very interested in. I sent the contact sheet in, and received a reply from Monty Melton. I responded that I would be in that evening, as soon as I got off of work to look at and possibly purchase the vehicle. 
By the time my wife and I made it from our jobs in Fort Worth over to the dealership in Garland (a trip of over 40 miles) it was 7 P M, and the dealership was a ghost town. The lady behind the desk in the new car showroom attempted to call Mr Melton, but he had already left for the day. She managed to find Joe Ritmo to help us. Mr Ritmo dug up the paperwork from my contacts with Mr Melton, and came up to tell me that he was not able to get the keys, as the person who kept custody of them had left for the day, but he was more than happy to let me take a look at the exterior.
He then went to get a vehicle so that we could drive back to where the car was parked. When he eventually returned (20-30 minutes later), he said that he had not been able to find the car, but would drive me around the lot to look for it, just in case he had missed it. We drove the entire lot. Both sides of the front and the back, around the detailing building, over to the fleet area, and around the back of the buildings of the fleet side. After we had been around the entire property, Mr Ritmo dropped my wife and I off at the front of the New Car. He stated that he would be in the next morning by nine, would speak to Mr Melton, and track down the vehicle, then call me.  The only options that he could think of that might explain the disappearance were: (1) it was in service for something, (2)it was taken to auction, ""but that was not likely since cars are taken Wednesday morning"", or (3) a salesperson had demoed it home, contrary to company policy. 
The next morning (today), when I got into the office, I sent an email to Mr Melton stated what had occurred the previous evening, and that I was still interested in the car, to please let me know what was going on.  When I had not gotten a response by 11:15, I went to the website and used the chat feature to see if I could get one of the internet sales people (Mr Melton and Mr Ritmo are both internet sales) to find the status.  The lady who I chatted with said that she spoke to Mr Melton, and he would find out, and call me ""very soon"".
The call from Mr Melton came at 1:30 P M. He stated that the car had been sent to auction, but that they had called to have it brought back, and it should be back on the lot between 5:30 and 6:00, but that he would call me to confirm.
That call never came in.  
My major issue is that I contacted the dealership early on Tuesday expressing interest.  Instead letting me know that the vehicle was scheduled to go to auction, or letting whoever takes them to auction know that it needed to stay on the lot, no appropriate action was taken.  The fact that none of the sales people seemed to have any clue what was going on, especially since it was the first of the month, and it had been very slow.  I was allowed to drive almost 100 miles (round trip) to look at a vehicle that was no longer available for sale. Very sloppy, and very poor customer service.  I will never do business with Randall Reed Prestige Ford, and will be sure to let everyone that I know how I was treated.

So I went in, figuring worst case scenario, I would let them make me an offer and if I didn't like it, I would get a $25 gas certificate for my time.  They showed me some vehicles and we talked money, but we couldn't reach a deal, so I thanked the salesman and asked for my gas certificate, and he gave me some tri-fold pamphlet on how to request a gas certificate, which instructs you fill out a form, then send it registered mail to an address then wait 4-8 weeks for a certificate, fill it out and attach a gas receipt, then send it in and wait another 4-8 weeks for reimbursement.  But wait, there's more!  You are only allowed to submit one reimbursement and it has a maximum of $10.  So if you get $50 in gas and try to get your $25 reimbursement, they will only send you $10.
