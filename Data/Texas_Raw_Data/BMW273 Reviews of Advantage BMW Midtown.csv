1,"September 06, 2019","Car Dealerships do not have the best reputation, but Sergio made the whole experience flawless and earned my trust as well. My experience:

Car was ready for me to view when I drove 3hrs to see it. 
Sergio was there as he said he would be and the car was in the exact condition he said (maybe bettter).
I requested touch up paint for a rock chip the size of a pepper flake like any black vehicle has with more than 1000 miles these days. Financing was preapproved and went without a hitch as well. Total time at the dealership was 2.5hrs. 

When I arrived home in my haste (my wife realized the cargo cover) was missing. Sergio said, ""No problem I will get one to you!"" and sure enough he did the touch up pain he promised and the cargo cover arrived at no charge.

Great dealership, great experience with Sergio!

2,"September 04, 2019","As having purchased several BMW's I must give Kudos for customer service to your salesman Chris Mieles and yesterday Denny Holiday. The most negative factor in the sale process I received fell completely short of anything remotely close to a pleasant experience was with your business manager Sean Lotice who originally cost me to leave and only the follow up by Chris savedthe deal. This negativebusiness experience was by far the worst experience that I have had at any of the BMW dealership business staff from whom I purchased from in Denver, Dallas and your sister store in Clear Lake Texas, which has been the most pleasant, maybe you should sent Sean Loftice to that store for training. To think, your store prides itself in ""total"" customer service.with Sean being the last person to kill deals is beyond belief.",4.0
3,"September 02, 2019","Do not buy from here

I wanted to write this review, to in short tell you why you shouldn’t buy a pre-owned car from this dealer. I purchased an Audi s4 from them for 27,500 out the door including what my salesman called a bumper to bumper warranty that was 4600 of those dollars. 
It turns out the warranty was barely worth the paper it was printed on and I’ve been forced to cover the majority of the repairs listed below. 
In my first few months of ownership I have had to repair or replace the following, the expense of those repairs are listed below. 

Rock Chip – 70.00
Transmission flush and oil change 340.00
CEL check – 355.41
Air temp sensor and throttle body plate – 571.41
Harmonic balancer (warranty) – 869.53
Drive belt – 291.5
Battery – 333.27
Driver side headlight running light – 386.02
Front pads, rotors, and sensors – 370.30
Front brushing/control arms/ motor mounts/ thermostat etc (partial warranty over 1900 out of pocket)- 4576.65

All in the car has cost 8164.09 cents with a fraction of it covered by the paper thin warranty they sold me.  
They do not adequately inspect cars before selling them and the warranty’s they sell are janky at best, don’t buy from them.",1.0
4,"March 16, 2019","Purchased a 2013 650i last month, not my daily driver, got a drivetrain malfunction warning & took it to the service dept.My service advisor Matt Phillips informed me that there were at least 5 things they found WRONG with the  car,totalling around  $5600.00.Needless to say I was NOT a happy camper. I purchased an extended warranty when I bought the car however they only want to cover$146 of a $476 ignition coil issue,stating that these are all pre-existing conditions.UNBELIEVABLE!!! It's been about 9 days since I took the car back & STILL haven't heard anything from them as to any kind of resolution. Now I'm beginning to wonder what else is wrong with the car that should have been discovered during pre-inspection & make-ready.",1.0
5,"December 11, 2018","When my car was under warranty, I had to use the dealership to get serviced.  After a couple of times, I noticed that when I took my car in for a routine service or recall, something else always went wrong, i.e., the brakes, air conditioning, sensors, oil leaks, even the bottom fell off after an oil change which costs me $500!  After my car was no longer under warranty, I found my own mechanic who is honest, fair and has kept my car running perfectly for over a year.  In September, 2018, after being pressured from phone calls, emails and letters, I hesitantly took my car into the dealership for recalls because they said the parts may not be available if I waited.  I told my service advisor about my previous experiences and begged her to only do the recalls and do not touch ANYTHING else as my car was running perfectly.  After getting the recalls done, I noticed my car was very sluggish and in exactly one week, it would not start!  I called the service advisors several times asking for information on exactly what was done to make my car not start after the recalls, and no one returned my call.  I decided to take it to my mechanic who extensively checked all the wires and battery cables and all were good and determined it had to be the starter.  After replacing the starter, my car started right up!  After a week, it died.  After replacing the starter two more times and $1,000 in parts and labor trying to figure out what was wrong, I called Advantage BMW demanding that the mechanic who did the recalls needed to fix the problem because he knew the reason why my car would not start.  After five days of ""investigating the problem"" BMW charged me $350 to tighten a loose wire -- a loose wire with no description of where it was or anything other than from ""previous repairs"".  I believe the service technician intentionally loosened a wire during the recalls so that I could bring it back for service.  It has happened to me too many times, and I am sick and tired of these scams.  I have asked for a full investigation of my case in writing and no one has contacted me from Advantage BMW regarding it.  I am writing this review so customer are informed about them and hopefully I can make a difference.        ",1.4
6,"November 08, 2018","DO NOT TAKE YOUR VEHICLE HERE FOR SERVICE. 

Unfortunately, the warranty provider of my car recommended that I take it to this location (being that I live less than 2 miles from the service department) as the vehicle had an error code for a solenoid (drive train malfunction). Upon arriving at the dealership, On October October 25, 2018, the young lady that checked me in indicated that they would immediately take it to the service department and finish having the diagnostics completed and then they would relay the results to the warranty provider and see what they approved. 

This was on a Thursday afternoon. On Monday, I got a little curious as to the status (as I had not heard anything from the service folks). I decided to contact them directly. 

Upon contacting the service department, I was notified that my ""advisor"" had been released from service and that my car had not been addressed yet and that the warranty provider had not been contacted. This now starts the 14 day fiasco at Midtown BMW. Fiasco, is to say it politely. 

I then contacted my warranty provider who indicated they had not been contacted of the vehicles status to date. After being directed to a second service advisor,  of which did a good job , indicated it would be 2 days for the warranty inspector to arrive to evaluate the claims that NOW the oil pan was leaking at the seal, the timeline chain cover was seeping, the solenoid needed replaced to the tube of $3200. Rightfully so , the warranty provider wanted to perform an inspection. This would push the issue too Wednesday. 

Once approved by the warranty provider, the Advantage Service team began to work. which was 1 calendar week (7 days) after I dropped the vehicle off.

Finally, on the following Monday I received a call regarding the vehicle. I was informed that the hub bolts were stripped and that "" it wasn't them"" (where I was asked if I had taken the wheels off the car for any reason. Yes - if I had removed them). Obviously, they indicated that they were stripped before they touched the wheel. 

After arguing with the service advisor for a few minutes, he said he would talk with the service manager and get back to me. The service manager called back an indicated they would replace the hub but it would take a day or so for the part to come in. 

Then, on Wednesday at 09:57 I was notified that they vehicle was put back together and that they were contacting the warranty provider for payment. At 1:03pm on November 7, 2018, I was delivered my car back. From October 25 thru November 7, 2018, the vehicle was in Advantage BMW Midtown's possession. 

As I left the service area, I drove immediately home which is 16 blocks from the service department. I then parked my car, when into my residence to change clothes for a meeting. When I returned ~2 hr's later, the car would not start. 

I immediately called Advantage BMW Midtown where they sent a loaner car and made arrangements for a tow truck to bring the vehicle back to the service department. Later in the afternoon, the verdict was that a radar detector , that was professionally installed 2 month prior, was causing the car not to start. Obviously, I was surprised to hear that. I was escorted to one of the ""service department managers"" who stated the same thing. 

I left with the vehicle, when low and behold, there was an error code displayed on the dash and the radar detector was not operating as they unplugged it from the fuse box. When I returned, they took the car again, to clear the code, indicated that the battery was bad and they then went to change the battery ( which I don't think they did as they did not provide me with a receipt and there is not evidence that the bolts had been removed in the truck area cover/housing for the battery). 

With all this said, I now have new scratches on the bumper of my car from an unknown origin, and am apprehensive to whether any of the service that was performed was as there is no evidence that the passenger side hub is in new condition. 

Based off of this fiasco, I can only come to the conclusion that this service department is one of those that scams it's customers and attempts to leverage their ""reputation"" being a certified BMW service centers and prey's on customers that may not be mechanically inclined or say to these deceptive practices. As a consumer, I feel obligated to warn other potential customers of the possible fraudulent activities that occur at this service center. 

STAY AWAY - DRIVE A LITTLE FURTHER TO ANOTHER BMW SERVICE CENTER. 

The initial concern of the solenoid was a ~$300-$400 service. I was billed $3242.52. Absolute deceptive in practice.

7,"September 01, 2018","Gave them a $1k deposit and signed a buyers order on Wednesday to buy a car bc I live in Fort Worth and I said I would be there Friday to get it. Negotiated my trade in and everything. Get a call Thursday night that they sold the car, and they were ""changing"" their deposit guidelines, obviously to their advantage. Then the general manager Philip wouldn't answer my calls. DO NOT do business with them, they are shady!!!",1.0
8,"May 03, 2018",Basically had a dealer lie about having an available allocation for new model M.  Waited a couple months and never got an update or production number.  Decided to find another dealer with an actual allocation production number.  Very disappointed with the customer service.,1.0
9,"April 11, 2018","About 4 days ago I found a car I was interested in Truecar and was listed to this Dealership. I called and they assure me that with a down-payment and the credit application the car could be in my possession this week. I went to their website to apply practically sent in the rudest way to do it online by Robert Brand, the car sales man. My wife and I filled the application and sent the reference number to move forward with the process. Thats the last time we heard from him, Our credit was Hit more than once, we never got any response whatsoever of our application. I decided to call him and find out what has happened to our application and he did not even remember our names, I asked to speak with his manager and pretty much got the same treatment, discourteous, unprofessional, disrespectful,, bragging about selling the car we have been applying for about a week. 

Please do not support this type of business, Do not encourage mistreatment, lack of professionalism and disregard for a person...

Today you demonstrated a gap between what the service shop can handle workload wise versus what you commit.  Worse, the customer service aspect was pathetic to have to initiate interaction on a service that was not staying on schedule.  Make me feel like a relevant customer and you can earn my business.  Treat me like another sales receipt and why should I come back.

I must say that Harry Fernandez at Advantage BMW Midtown Service is by far the best. I never have problems or issues when dealing with him. This past time I had to have work done requiring them to Lee my car for 5 days. The service department lost a good number of their loaners due to Hurricane Harvey but Harry was able to secure him a loaner car from Hertz and got it paid for by my extended warranty company. He called me daily giving me feedback on the status of the parts coming in and whatever else was going on with my car. He got all the service paid for by my warranty company and made sure that I didn’t have to return the rental car to Hertz. I simply dropped the car off at BMW and Harry had it picked up.

The service department technicians are not as eager to help or problem solve they make you feel like you are a problem some of them and you get treated differently than most other people like you are somehow less important because of race and the loaner department also has its ratio of favorites of who gets loaners and who doesn't and when some people have to wait others have privilege s even the new Hispanic manager was rude to me     And I was switched from Robert to a technician that never gets anything.

They apologized and got it fixed however my bill was mysteriously $250 more than my first attempt to pick up my car.   If you are going to do business with these guys you have to have them quote the work ahead of time and you have to analyze in detail before you pay.   They of course rectified the issue and reduced the cost more as an apology for the inconvenience for making me return a second time to retrieve my car.   I trust that they are honest when they say that something should be fixed.  I met the technicians and they walked me through the work they did and gave me some pointers on what I should be looking for in the next 20,000 miles.

203,"January 13, 2017","My husband (who is active duty military) and I went to this dealership on New Years Eve looking to buy a used car. We had been stopping to dealerships all day searching for something roomy for our daughter who attends UTSA. She had been driving a 1995 BMW 525i so we were very confident in the BMW brand. We've only been stationed in Texas 2 years so this was our first trip into the midtown area since we live so far north and don't have a need to travel into downtown Houston.  Anyhow, we test drove a 2006 BMW X3 that appeared to be in great condition. Our salesman was Boris. When we test drive the vehicle we noticed tire pressure warning light was on and the check engine soon light as well. So we asked about it and we were assured that it would be taken care of. After looking at vehicles for 2 days all around Houston we settled on that one. We drove it home 12/31 and about half way back up to Spring the same light for tire pressure that we were assured would be taken care of was back on. We immediately called the dealership. We understand vehicles are bought AS-IS but to have engine lights and such coming on as you're driving it home? No bueno! We had it looked at in Jan 3 and Discount Tire. So turns out a sensor on the rear passenger side needed to be fixed. We paid discount tire to take care of it. The truck sat in the driveway until the weekend where our daughter could come home and drive it back to San Antonio. So as she was driving it back to San Antonio, the engine light that we were told was fixed was on again. My daughter took it to Auto Zone in Dan Antonio to have them hook up the computer to read the codes. Turns out there is an engine coil in cylinder 4 that needs to be replaced. We've had this vehicle a whopping 11 days. I totally get ""used"" and ""as-is"" but damn at least be honest with us about the codes it is pulling. I don't mind fixing things that are wrong, but I HATE being misled and being told that you fixed something when you clearly did not! Lesson learned? Don't shop at this dealership. As a military family we pride ourselves on working with good people since we have to move around so much. But this vehicle was for our daughter and they knew that because we told them!!!! To put her in ANY kind of danger or concern whatsoever is what truly bothers me as a parent. When my husband contacted Boris he kept saying ""well I told you it was as-is"" my husband said yeah I got that but you basically lied to us because those codes were not addressed like you reassured us they would be! If you want return customers the least you could do is tell the whole truth. That's all a customer wants. I'll make sure to never patron this dealership and will let our friends know our experience so that other military personnel don't make the mistake we made. If a vehicle is As-Is ask them specifically to hook it up to the computer to ensure you are not buying a problem. Don't be like us which is trusting that they did what they said they would. Don't be trusting of the ""sales guy"". ",2.2

216,"October 15, 2016","The worst service ever 
Slightly long review but the truth and I don't like to be played 

I was a potential buyer from out of state and called into the dealership for a specific car and spoke to Ricardo Quiroz on a Friday morning and while speaking to him I already told him that I was from out of state and would have to conduct the business over phone and or email.  By friday evening I had decided to buy the car and requested him to send me all the written literature about the car and also the financing application. I provided him two email addresses - a gmail address and one a work address. Ricardo never sent anything and when I was finally able to get a communication back from me he told me that he had left for home and that he had already emailed the papers ( which was a lie) and that he would email again on Saturday. On saturday he did email me the papers after I gave him two reminders.

After I filled in the financing application I called and texted Ricardo multiple times to which he did not reply at all. Then he finally texted me back and told me that he could not talk to me because he had customers that he was tending too. I think that he forgot that an internet customer is a customer too. Finding out that Ricardo will not tend to me I called other sales agents and two of them told me that they could not access my file/ application since Ricardo had locked me in the system so that nobody else could access my file either. So basically neither would he assist me, nor would he let anybody else assist me.

So the whole of Saturday I tried calling him and texting him asking for assistance and finally at around 6:00 PM he told me the car was sold. He played me the whole of the Saturday while he was making a deal with somebody else and probably holding me as a back up offer just in case the first one did not go through.

The pre-owned office has the worst service I have have experienced, to back it up I was an out of state customer and then Ricardo takes the cake. 

I don't know how a dealership allows a sales associate to lock out a prospective buyer so that nobody else can help him or her if he is tending to some other customer/s

223,"May 11, 2016","After multiple attempts to resolve through with BMW directly to no avail, I'm hoping I can warn someone about the deceptive practices at this location to perhaps save someone from going through a similar experience. 

My husband purchased a brand new 2015 435i Gran Coupe in the Summer of 2015. A few days ago we noticed a knocking noise in the rear left of the car. He took it in to Advantage Midtown since it's still under warranty and is far too new to be having any major issues. They informed us that a control arm in the suspension snapped and that they wouldn't cover it under the warranty because it was considered driver fault. When we tried to ask what type of driver fault scenario could cause this, no one could explain and they kept reiterating that they had never seen anything like it before. So considering the car is barely driven and my husband only drives it to work in the Galleria and back home, this made no sense and sounds like a clear mechanical defect. Then they attempted to say well maybe you hit a pothole or drove too fast out of a driveway.

A few things are wrong with this but the greatest being that my husband is a certified Professional Engineer (PE) with a specialty in Mechanical Engineering. I don't say that to sound haughty but to emphasize how you can't pull a fast one on him in this area. The pothole and driveway scenarios are baseless and would never result in a break to a control arm. So that scenario is unfounded. Once my husband started talking stress fractures etc (terms going completely over my head), the mechanic was clearly clueless and just deferred to his manager who repeated the same thing like a robot (warranties don't cover driver fault). My husband knows that the only impact that would've resulted in a clean break to this internal piece would have to be so profound that undeniably there would be other damage to other pieces yet all pieces of our car's underbody and outside of the vehicle were in impeccable condition. Control arms don't just ""break"" spontaneously unless the component is defective. 

They said they would have a field engineer come out to do an assessment and my husband requested that he be present, and they agreed to call him. I was there to see two representative make this promise. The next day, the ""assessment"" was completed, and not surprisingly it reaffirmed the service dept's assessment but no one had contacted my husband. Convenient right? Of course they didn't want the intelligent owner who knows mechanical engineering to be present.

Ok I'm rambling but after much back and forth, and even our insurance company saying that they consider this a mechanical defect and it should be BMW's responsibility, BMW is still refusing to repair this under the warranty. So we resorted to filing a complaint with the BBB. 

In the BBB response from Juan Galvez, the Service Director, concocts a story about external impact to the vehicle. What impact?! The car is impeccable. We have requested for evidence and pictures to prove his claim that there was outside impact but he has yet to provide anything. So basically when backed into a corner, BMW has chosen to just fabricate scenarios and point fingers at everyone else instead of accept responsibility and cover a repair under the warranty. 

We will NEVER be customers of this dealership again and more than likely never purchase another BMW. We never had these types of problems with Infiniti and Audi.",1.8
224,"April 19, 2016","My car was in the shop for a total of 25 days. My wife initially took the car in because it was shaking. We thought that it could possibly be a motor mount. Advantage BMW replaced a motor mount the year before and the symptoms were similar.
Advantage BMW diagnosed the problem initially as being another motor mount and after 10 days, they replaced it and we picked up the car. The problem was not fixed correctly and we had to return the car to the shop. This second trip saw the car being in the shop for 15 days. The problem was diagnosed correctly for our second trip as being a faulty ignition coil. I also asked them to look into the fuel sensor, which they did and ultimately fixed. We do not feel that it should have taken 25 days to fix a motor mount, ignition coil and fuel sensor. 
If the service manager knew that a motor mount would not cause a “service engine soon” light to appear, why would a highly skilled & trained BMW technician not know that? Was the motor mount fixed in error? Does my extended warranty company need to be made aware of an unnecessary repair that was charged to them?
My wife received a rental vehicle for our first appointment. Her credit card was charged twice by Enterprise in error. The second service appointment found me in front of an Enterprise employee who attempted to collect $750 from me that Advantage BMW still owed from the 1st appointment. 
Our first service advisor claimed not to be able to reach our extended warranty company for four days when my wife, on the other hand, was able to make one telephone call and get them on the phone. 
In summary, I will never return to any Advantage BMW location and will share my story of poor customer service as others have a right to know how they will be treated when they entrust Advantage BMW with their vehicle

233,"February 05, 2016","I would highly discourage anyone needing to service a BMW from using Midtown BMW. They are not the only dealership with a service center in the Houston area (thank goodness for that) and I can assure you that the service you receive from Midtown BMW would be a frustrating disappointment. My most recent experience at the service center servicing a car I purchased from this dealership, was such an absolute joke it's hard to even paint a clear picture of just how terrible the customer service at this location is. After bringing my car in for an issue and being charged thousands of dollars worth of unnecessary parts and labor to ""fix"" the issue, I was told the car was repaired. On my way home from picking up my car at the service center the issue I brought the car in for was still very present and had not been fixed, and to make matters much worse the car completely died (which it has never done before). So the car was towed back to the service center and they claimed they looked at the car again and the issue was repaired because they couldn't find any problems with the car. So I picked the car up from the service center for a second time in one week, and again, on the way home it was clear the cars issues had not been fixed. So I took the car back to the service center for a third time, and asked to speak with a mechanic and he was able to diagnose the cars issues right away and said he could fix it in a couple hours. 4 days later the car was ready (I'm still not sure how something that I was told would take a couple hours took 4 days). On the way home from the service center for the 3rd time, the ""check engine"" light came on. The service agent refused to refund us any of the money for all of the parts we purchased the first time we brought the car in, which just blows my mind considering all of those parts didn't fix the problem and were completely unnecessary. So in a nutshell, the Midtown BMW service center is a complete and total rip off, with customer service agents who care nothing about customer service, and mechanics who apparently have a very difficult time repairing BMW's even though that is what the specialize in. I strongly suggested you save yourself time and money by having you BMW serviced anywhere but Midtown BMW.",1.0

I purchased the car took the dealer to check the purpose of the check engine light and here is the surprise. they told me this car wont ever pass emission which by the way expire next month and it has a major problem with the engine that requires the whole engine to be out. asking how much would be they told it's going to be $7800 to get fixed. I almost got a heart attack. I called them and mentioned this to the sales man he said he is going to talk to the manager and I got a phone call from the manger telling me ""we are really sorry for the inconvenience but it's an as is kind of a sale we cant really help much"" then he mentioned if I need to go and trade in the car towards another car they'd try to help. give them the benefit of the doubt went over there and guess what they offered me way less than what I originally paid on the car and i didn't even have the car more than 2 weeks. My $3000 down payment is lost and I have to start from scratch. I almost agreed on it but i didn't feel comfortable doing the deal as I requested talking to the general manager and guess what again ""OH he just..."" Oh he came back after i left "" oh he is out of town and won't be able to come today"" ...... I didn't expect that way from a reputable dealer but this is what I got as far as my own experience. I wanted to share it with everybody just to make sure they don't fall in my mistake. I have all the documents to support my case and if anybody wants to have look let me know and I'll be more than happy to share this... Be careful and don't ever by any vehicle from them unless it has warranty and I won't be surprised if they would find a reason not to help even with their own warranty as I read before over here.",1.0
244,"June 28, 2014","I am a picky buyer and I read all the review prior to visiting Advantage BMW, and by far I have to say, this experience has been the best I had while purchasing my vehicle. The staff was caring about my needs, Yasmin did everything possible to ensure I found the perfect BMW, with professionalism, and you can tell they have been doing this for quite some time, an example is Mike Powell, whom I learned a life time, he is very devoted on what he does, and wants to make sure you have a great experience.

My salesperson, Yasmin Guerrero, was probably the most pleasant salesperson I have ever deal with, definitely when it comes to the new car buying experience.  She nailed down exactly what i was looking for and saved me a lot of time and she has done an outstanding job of making sure I am taken care of in 9 months since purchase.  Have not required much from Service Department to this point, but so far so good.  Definitely convenient to have dealership less than 5 minutes from work and the shuttle service has come in rather handy.   Love the car and glad to be in the BMW family.",5.0

257,"April 10, 2013",We leased a 535i 10 days ago; at time of purchase we we wavering between it and the X5. We were told to drive it and if you don't like it you can always switch. On day 7 we decided that was to small and out daughters booster seat just wouldn't fasten into it securely so we would like to exchange for X5. Of course once we went back to exchange it Advantage BMW told us that because the vehicle was already titled to us they could not take the vehicle back but we could exchange it by taking a $8700 loss since the new 535i had 499 miles on it. Every other Houston BMW dealership we called said they would have exchanged it had we of purchased it from them- we will never use Advantage BMW Midtown Houston again- I think they pushed the title work to be completed in 3 days just so we couldn't change our mind!,1.0
258,"April 20, 2012","I have purchased three BMWs from Advantage over the past 10 years and each year the level of service, quality and customer service has deminished. My most recent experience has been with getting my actual registration for my car. I purchased it the first week of February, had to go back into the dealership to fill out some ""forgotten"" paperwork a week later and then two weeks later only when I called in to see if they had received my registration was I told I needed to come back to dealership yet again so they could fill out and file yet another ""forgotten"" piece of paperwork required to get the car registered. Now, after 2 months and 3 weeks I went in and spoke with the General Manager, Pat Goldwait, who told me a week ago he would ""get on it and get it taken care of immediately"". I called yesterday, no return call and still no registration. Communication is a BIG issue with the sales team now. They don't understand how to do it! The first mistake made by them was selling me a ""certified pre-owned"" BMW only to call and tell me two weeks later it was actually not certified, the first oil change was performed late. Because it was no longer certificed the finance interest rate was increased and the warranty was no longer active. The finance team did correct the issue so that at least by reducing the financed amount of the vehicle even with the higher interest rate my payments remained the same and they added in a free extended warranty. Still, had they done their due diligence on the vehicle before placing it on the lot, they would have known it wasn't a certified car.

Good luck to anyone that stops in this location to by a new/used car. I don't see any hope in service improvements any time soon.",2.8
259,"April 02, 2012","Best experience I've ever had with purchasing a vehicle.  They have very high integrity in holding their end of the deal, even after the sale.

260,"March 16, 2012","2.5 months of getting my engine repaired after a bolt failure, ridiculously bad experience thanks to Advantage/Gustavo.  First review when it broke they wanted $24k to repair replace, didn't even mention the goodwill request option, when I learned about it from a friend who owns a body shop back north where I'm from they begrudgingly went along with the request.  They took me for a ride on diagnostics though, $1,700 and no loaner for 3 weeks.  After the several week of actual engine work (BMW NA did goodwill everything but diagnostics) I got it back with scratches on my car, the a/c not working for heat or cooling and my window buttons unresponsive.  All these were not problems when I gave them the car.

Took another week to get them to fix the scratches and A/C, they said the window wasn't their fault and it would cost me $1,200 to repair it.  I went to Metro because they were very helpful on the body work in this ordeal, the owner ordered a replacement window button, popped it in and got the contacts working all in under 10 min.  Didn't even charge me a cent because the original part worked after re-fitting it, was a loose connection.

Overall these guys are looking at every customer as a wallet and BMW Advantage is only here to take ADVANTAGE of the customer.  I love my car and take immaculate care of it but will not work with them again and certainly would never recommend them to anyone for their ridiculously overpriced and shoddy work.  Anyone who can't stand by their mistakes or fix simple problems like that 10 min free repair and say ""give me $1,200"" is not reputable and puts profits over clients.",1.0

If you are a busy professional, save yourself time, aggravations and money and go to other friendly BMW dealers in town that will appreciate your business.  We will never return to this dealership for anything, even if they pay us…!!!  And would not even recommend them to our enemy…  !!!!

264,"July 11, 2011","I went to this dealership, today, on my lunch break. I went to the showroom floor and there were at least 8 sales reps at their desk, none were busy.... After about 3 minutes, I asked a guy wearing a red shirt (service rep), if any sales reps worked at this location.  He looked around and saw the same 8 reps, who had not acknowledged him nor I (at this point).  He approached the desk of one, told them what I needed and he STILL did not come to assist, ask questions, tell me he was busy and would be right with me....NOTHING!  I went out to the lot, looked at the cars, came but in, stood within his view and he never approached me.  Horrible client customer service skills were exhibited, today, by the entire staff (with the exception of the service rep (who does not work on the sales side).  I was disappointed with this level of service or lack thereof.  I will write a letter to express this to the General Manager, Pat Goldwait!

He said one of the windows will not roll up but I never had this problem.  Then he keeps telling me about other car issues.  

I have talked to another mechanic and reviewed the issues with him and he said they are not critical.

Brian and the rest of the Service Dept. were able to resolve the issue the first time in a timely manner without giving me the runaround like the other dealership.  Since then, my experiences have been nothing but stellar.  I had my fuel pump go bad on me a week before a vacation, but the earliest appointment was Friday, the day before I was supposed to leave.  At first, Brian told me the car wouldn't be touched until Monday, but when I explained the situation to Brian, he was able to have the car fixed by noon the next day!

268,"December 18, 2009","This is my second BMW that I have owned and there are several short fallings compared to other vehicles in its class.  The biggest and most import is the road noise.  When I first purchased this car the road noise was minimal, but after 15k miles the road noise became so bad that I could not conduct business calls while driving.  I travel quite a bit and rental mid-class cars road noise was much less than the BMW.  Second, is the options are overpriced.  I spent an additional 12K on options that many other luxury cars have standard.  And the free maintenance is not so free.  These cars sit low to the ground and if you knock your alignment out it will cost you 250 each time, and the dealership I used couldn't ever get it right.  Additionally, from a technology perspective they are lacking and seem to be a couple years behind.  Overall I would NOT purchase a BMW and I would recommend checking with the other luxury auto makers first.  I have two years left on my lease and I have purchased another vehicle to use for my daily use and the BMW sits in the garage collecting dust.",2.8
269,"May 29, 2009","I purchased a 550i last Saturday, whcih had to be shipped from Austin.  Picked it up this afternoon.  This had to be one of the simplest car purchasing experiences I have had.  No back and forth.  I did my research.  Made an offer.  They accepted.  And unlike Momentum BMW, where I bought my last car, there were no surprises when it came to closing the deal, i.e. no dealer prep.  At the closing, the Finance Manager does try to get you buy the extended warranty and other stuff but it was not pushy.  She explained the various options but once I said no, she moved on.  The bulk of the time was spent going over the various gadgets - navigation, voice activation, smartphone and iPod integration, etc.  Things I did not have on my previous car.  So, so far Advantage has been good.  I'll be back to report how they handle any issues if they come up.  Also, when I take it in for service.",4.4

They had my car there for over two weeks and didn't do some of the work they had listed in writting and didn't provide a rental till after 4 days of having the car in the shop for warrenty work after they said one would be available.  They replaced the headlights and said they verified the work that was done, but when I got my car the driver side light was facing the ground and the passenger light was hitting the trees.  They were also suppose to turn off the driving lights and it even said that on the work order.  The tech stated that the driving lights were activated and working and the job was verified.  How do you activate something that is already on even when you were told to turn it off.  On top of other service issues (workmanship) my plates were not received in over 1 month.  The reason the sales team gave me was that there was an error on their end of the paper work and they had to re-submit the paperwork a few times till they got it right.  I will finally receive my plates today.  I will never buy another car from Advantage BMW and will refer everyone I know to other BMW delaerships.

I will never go to these guys again and receommend that if you care about your car, you do the same.",1.2
