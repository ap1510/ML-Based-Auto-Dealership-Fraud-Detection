0,"March 01, 2018",We had a great experience at Hicks Family Nissan. The sales staff were friendly and didn't put pressure on us. They made us feel welcome. The price they gave us is exactly what we wanted to spend. There was no pressure to buy extra items that we didn't want. They were able to get us good financing without problems. I highly reccomend them.,5.0

9,"January 11, 2018",I asked Joel to keep me in mind when a good cash car deal was available and he did exactly that. A few months pasted by and sure enough I was the first he called about a good deal on a cash pickup truck. Joel got a me a good deal and I was in and out without much a fuss in negotiating. Joel did most of the work before I even got to the dealership which saved a lot time. In the end Joel did a great job customer service and has earned my future business.,5.0
10,"January 11, 2018","Joel Vasquez is an outstanding person/salesman.  Easy to know and very trustworthy.  His interest was in finding what I wanted and not what he wanted to sell.  He took ample time and never seemed in a hurry.  I appreciate all of his efforts, and I am sure this young man has a bright future with Hicks.",5.0
11,"January 08, 2018","Really impressed and enjoyed superb customer service from Dee Sanders! He greeted us while we were still in our vehicle, was honest with every aspect of the process and found the answers from his supervisor, Mike Andruzzi, when uncertain. Very professional, friendly and prompt answers and over all service! I will recommend Dee Sanders, Mike Andruzzi and this specific dealership to all my friends and family!

Thank you Dee Sanders with helping my family find an excellent deal and car for our family!",5.0
