0,"December 27, 2017","Purchased A 2500 hd truck in April.  First trip transmission cooler was plugged by Mayflies (love bugs) Complained to the Owner in Law (Darrel) and he promised the problem would be brought to a quick resolution with GM .  Never heard from him again.  November the steering became very loose .  Took it to Laroche and they fixed the problem .  Turns out GM had issued a bulletin to correct the problem.  The dealer Laroche and General motors did not notify me or anyone of the safety issue.
Today my battery went dead  and  I charged the battery to take the truck into Laroche to save them from having to two me in.  They tested the battery and said it was rechargeable so no replacement.
No more GM Chevrolet and laroche for me.  I am so upset with them I am moving my church Membership to another congregation.  (The Pews are full of Laroch people)",1.0
1,"May 23, 2008","I had a very easy time buying a car.  There was no back and forth.  I called Robert, he gave me a pretty good price that was within a few 100 dollars of a couple of other dealerships but he answered all my questions in a non carsaleman kind of way.  Just a friendly guy.  I showed up and he sold me the car for the price he quoted.  I had no haggle.  I paid cahs and they showed me warranty info and other finance things and when I declined them they were okay.  They didn't threaten me or take my car away.  Just a stand up guy.  ",5.0
