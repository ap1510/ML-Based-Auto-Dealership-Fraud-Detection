0,"March 28, 2020","I bought a 2007 Jeep grand Cherokee in August for my 17-year-old daughter. Rishi  was my salesman, after warranty the price of the vehicle was $7200 which after speaking with multiple car dealers is about 3000 over the value of the vehicle. Within four months I had complete engine failure( The vehicle died with my daughter driving it on the middle of Highway 290 and started going backwards) and after the Engine went out I had the car picked up in the same day brought in because the transmission went out as well. Kia of South Austin in no way offered me a vehicle for the time that my car spent in the shop or any help with fixing the vehicle. I asked them if I could please trade the car back in to get my money back and they said no. It was only after about three weeks of yelling and calling the general managers that they decided to help with the transmission. These are untrustworthy people who do not care about your safety, DO NOT purchase a vehicle from Kia of South Austin.",1.0

2,"November 21, 2019","Stay away! Very much like some other reviewers on this site. Drove car in the AM and did'nt buy because they didn't want to discount. However I agreed on the asking price the car in the afternoon. Said I would be at dealership when it opened the following morning. When I arrived, they told me it was sold the night prior. Funny thing, vehicle was parked in a back corner of the dealership as though it was being hidden. Extremely dishonest people. I've tried to do deals on cars at this dealership for 15+ years hoping a mangement change would make it better. Naw, still the same unprofessional lie to the customer experience as before.",2.2
3,"October 10, 2019","In the defense of the the dealership, my experience with the sales team was more helpful than my experience with service department. But, didn't buy a car! My car was being serviced and dealing with the service team was nonnegotiable. In fact the only reason I spoke with the salesman was, the service manager hung the phone up on me... 

I recieved a recall for the vehicle in the mail, a recall for the steering column and I also needed some electrical work done. Being I had bought the car used I purchased an extended warranty (having that didnt make me popular to the service team) I dropped the car off on a Monday and was told it would be ready by Wednesday....

Long story short, Kia of south Austin had my car for 8 days, they insisted I pay for the rental due to them not ordering the right parts and then, when I speak to the service manager not only did he hang up on me, he yelled at me in the process. Today I get the car back, and the vehicle wasn't cleaned, (even Walmart will give a courtesy vacuum with a oil change) and yes, I saw the sign in the waiting area saying, due to water restrictions they'll not be doing the ""car ready wash"", but a courtesy vacuum, and with the experience I had...The steering column is now offset, so I'm guessing I'll need to take it else where to get that fixed. I'm sure the excuses will pile on if I attempt to take it back to Kia of South Austin .

Needless to say I will not be a returning customer.

Very poor customer service.....

Update: Brian, if the customer is your #1 you'd call me to make things right, not make public justification over a upset customers review...",1.0
4,"August 21, 2019",Avoid this dealership for pre-owned cars. They list prices online and don't honor them in store. They list cars at higher trim levels than they are. The sales manager won't get out of his chair to try and make a deal. They did not want to pay for the (Kia) windshield that did not show as broken in their listing pictures but has a crack so large it will not pass inspection as is. ,1.2
5,"July 31, 2019",Within the first week of haveing my new car I had a main oil leak KIA refused to even look at it at first. After having to argue with them they took it in to look at it and told me it was bought as is. The dealer came back with over $5000 worth of repairs. Now I can get anyone there to return my calls. Insane customer service. Seems like the sale is all that matters there. No matter what it takes to get it. Stay away very dishonest ,1.0
6,"July 09, 2019",This dealership is willing to work with anyone buying a new cart but after they have sold you the vehicle you will be unable to reach them or get any kind of help. Please avoid this dealership if you wish to get any kind of customer service after the purchase of your new vehicle.,2.4
7,"June 17, 2019","Alternator issue. Just bought new battery from O'reilly. South Austin Kia said they could do no diagnostic work until I buy a new battery from them. Also, they could not assure me that they would honor my warranty if I bought a battery somewhere else. Total BS.",1.0
8,"April 05, 2019","DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THE FINANCE PEOPLE OF THIS PLACE.

If I could give zero stars to the finance section of this establishment, I absolutely would.  My story started back on February 23, 2019 and I am still battling with them to this day.  I've tried to be patient but with BILL LITTLE completely disregarding me yesterday and the Finance Manager just happening to be out that day and I have not gotten any message back from the GM, I thought I would take it to the internet because people need to know how to not get screwed.

I purchased a Kia Niro from these guys on Feb. 23.  Walked in with financing already in place for X amount.  Found a car, purchased it with said X check from the bank and used my own CREDIT CARD for the remainder of the car balance, which was roughly $1800 or so.  We then speak with BILL, who scammed us so hard I can't even believe he's still there.  He talked to us about the extended warranty and why we should get it, prices, etc and when he saw I didn't want to pay that much (or really any at all) he was all like ""Oh well here let me give you my employee discount rate.""  In retrospect, that was probably the ACTUAL amount of the warranty and he was just screwing with us, as most dealership people do.  But for whatever reason, I decided to go ahead and purchase it with the guarantee that I could cancel it within 30 days and get a full refund.  THIS IS WHERE THE BATTLE BEGINS.

I asked this man, BILL LITTLE, that since I was paying for this warranty SEPARATELY (ie, I was putting the full $2691 on my CREDIT CARD) that if I did cancel it, if it would be refunded via credit card or paper check since this is the method of payment.  HE. SAID. YES.

Two days later, I walk in and cancel the warranty.  I signed the paperwork he provided and said the refund would credit back to my card within 3-5 weeks.  Good, easy enough, right?  Wrong.  So, so wrong.

I started calling Kia to reach Bill starting on 03/21/19 to speak with Bill and see where the refund status is at since my credit card cycle was closing on 04/03/19 and I needed to know when the $2691 would be hitting.  He did not respond.  He did not call, did not answer messages, anything.  Finally, after calling for days, on 03/30 I got ahold of another lady, (Jenn?) and told her what was going on, she said she'd talk to Bill but since it was the last day of the month (NOT MY FAULT) he might be busy.  I even had a friend go in in person later to stress the urgency of this issue.  Nothing.

Come Monday 04/01, I finally get a call from Bill saying he'd look into it and get back to me by the end of the day.  And of course, he didn't.  I emailed him with my number stating this is really urgent as the cycle closes in mere days.  Nothing on Tuesday 04/02.

I go into the dealership on Wednesday 04/03 to speak with him in person and OF COURSE he is out for the day and NOBODY there has any idea what he's doing.  I am basically told 'sucks to be you, come back tomorrow' even though I stressed how important this is.   Thanks guys, super helpful.

Yesterday, 04/04, Bill finally contacts me (at 12:20pm--so much for ""first thing in the morning"") and said in almost these exact words, ""Due to an error on my part I essentially attached the warranty information to your contract so the refund is going to be processed to your lien-holder and will reduce the amount you owe on the loan with them.""  WHAT. THE. ACTUAL. xxxx.   No Bill, NO.  This is NOT what we discussed.  The lien-holder has NOTHING to do with this.  I made a deal with them for X amount and paid the rest via credit card and did the warranty SEPARATELY.  I was told, on the original DAY that we even did this, that it would be refunded via credit card SINCE THAT IS HOW I PAID FOR THE xxxx THING IN THE FIRST PLACE.  The fact that it was an error on YOUR part, YOURS, has nothing to do with me.  I tried explaining to Bill that this was not acceptable and his basic response was ""you wanted an answer, this is what I got"" with ZERO inclination to actually help solve the issue. No apology, no offer to come in and figure it out, nothing.  I finally said well let me talk to the accounting people then and he mumbled something about them calling me or something then promptly hung up.  Ridiculous.

Hours pass, no call from accounting.  I call Kia AGAIN, this time asking for a finance manager or the GM as I now would A) like to file a formal complaint against Bill and B) I still need to get this $2691 back onto my card and not to the bank, whom has nothing to do with this whatsoever.  I was told the GM was out to lunch and the finance manager, of course, was conveniently out that day.   I left my name and number with the receptionist and was told she'd give it to the GM.   

This brings us to today.  I never got a call from the GM or anybody since 12:20pm yesterday when Bill basically said to suck it.  I now have a $2691 credit card bill due with interest because he could not give me an answer in time, nor do I have the means to actually pay for it WHICH IS WHY I CANCELLED IT IN THE FIRST PLACE.   

I am so fed up.  Nobody is willing to simply hit the ""refund to credit card"" button or take responsibility for messing up. I should not be penalized for BILL'S mistake when he explicitly told me time and time again that getting it on the card was correct.  So here I am.  Waiting to hear from the GM to file a complaint but really all I need is for this $2691 to be given back to ME somehow, not my lien-holder. 

The lack of communication (never heard from Bill or anyone in the 5 weeks that had already passed before he contacted me finally) and blatant disrespect is what has made me reach out to other outlets.  

I would appreciate it if ANYONE from the higher up chain would contact me and get this problem fixed (Bill absolutely has my name and number at this point, as does the GM of this location).  YOUR employee has messed up and he is refusing to take responsibility for it or try to amend it and I cannot believe this would be acceptable in a business setting.",1.0
9,"February 11, 2019","After coming to an arrangement on pricing I arrived at the dealership to find the car we'd made a deal on was ""sold"" (it wasn't) and that they would honor the pricing on a lesser car. 

Anthony was who I had a deal with, Derek was the smug manager who was quick to dismiss a well qualified buyer with money to burn .

He gave me a completion time that would get me to my appointment on time.  While I was in the waiting room he came in to update me on progress which I appreciated.

Salesman Robert Juarez made excellent suggestions based on my needs and limits – helping me find the perfect vehicle at the right price. He also helped us understand the dealer's commitment to service and followup. From vehicle surveys to polite query from the dealer – it's obvious this dealership cares about total customer experience. My first vehicle checkup was painless.

18,"January 28, 2019","After researching several cars online, I made the decision to check out the Kia Soul.   I submitted an online inquiry and received a prompt response from Thomas James.  He was very courteous and helpful. He made me an appointment for the time I needed.  Thomas was fantastic.  He was not at all ""salesmany""...I cannot stand that!  He seemed to genuinely want to help and got me what I wanted and needed.  He was very informed and straight forward while being personable. I left with what I really wanted to and am thrilled with my new Kia Soul! I would refer any of my friends or family to Thomas James and Kia of South Austin in a heartbeat.

Let me start off by saying Bertha was amazing!!!! She was so kind, and kept me in the loop the whole time they were working on my car.

He got me one we went for a test drive and that’s when I fell in love with the car and decided to get with out even trying the other brands, sometimes a smiley face and good experience is all what you need, and that’s what I got from that dealership, they are all professional and super nice. I would definitely recommend that dealership to anyone especially family and friends. 
If you are coming from a Luxury brand like myself you should keep in mind that when it comes to service they don’t offer loaners like Infinity Lexus BMW.... even on a $50.000 car, wish is they only thing I don’t like, but hopefully they will start that at least on their very expensive cars that they consider luxury cars.

78,"June 27, 2018","If I could score this dealership lower I would.  The service garage employees are sexist and practice scamming customers.  I called prior to showing up and spoke to a service manager who told me one thing (your service will be covered under warranty) after he looked up my vehicle's info and I explained the issue to him that I had diagnosed at 2 other garages.  I made an appointment and when I dropped my car off and a  salesman and a porter made sexually harassing jokes in Spanish because they thought I didn't speak the language when I was working with another  rep to give them my info for vehicle drop off.  I then had another man interrupt my conversation to explain to me that I didn't know what I was talking about regarding the check engine light code and issues that I brought with me from 2 other garages and the car needed to have a full diagnostic review and it would be $130 an hour.  I approved 1 hour only as I already had 2 other tests run from other garages and knew exactly what the p200a code was after my own research and it would not take more than an hour to run a code through a computer to get results.  I was called later and told that even though I only approved 1 hour they decided to go ahead and move forward with an additional 2 hours and that it would be $390 just for diagnosing my car and to top it off their diagnostic report WAS THE EXACT SAME INFORMATION THAT I CAME IN WITH.  I asked why it took so long to run a code and the service manager had only this to say well you dropped the car off at 12 and it's 3 now so that is three hours.  After I explained to him that just because I dropped my car off was not a reason to start charging me and I should only be charged for when a technician starts working on my car and because I brought all the information in to them it really shouldn't have taken more than an 1 hour.  Also, the service manager who was the same man I spoke to that told me the service was under warranty told me that it wasn't under warranty.  Needless to say I did not have my service done here and WILL NEVER RETURN TO THIS DEALERSHIP EVER AGAIN.  If you want to be sexually harassed, made to feel like an incompetent fool, completely scammed, and screwed over feel free to visit this dealership as they have those attributes in spades.  ",1.0
79,"June 19, 2018","My experience with this Kia dealership was disappointing, to say the least. Our salesman, Devin, had little knowledge about the vehicles, financing, and title. While test driving cars, Devin couldn't answer most questions we asked him, and a couple of the times he did answer he was wrong. After sitting down and agreeing on a price for the Forte, I decided I wanted a larger vehicle.  Devin did not hide his disappointment. He made comments like, ""come on, I've never seen us go this low on a price"", ""we've been here hours, just take it"", ""i live off commission. Just buy it."" I ended up deciding to go with the soul. While signing  the paper work Devin asked me to make sure to leave 5 star reviews and coached me on how to answer questions on a survey (which explains most of their reviews!).  Despite his lack of knowledge, he was friendly so i agreed. About a month later I go to pick up my plates and notice an issue with the title.  One that would have been avoided if Devin knew anything about sales. I tried to get help fixing the problem, but they made their sale. They didn't care anymore.  Ted, the extremely friendly gentleman from finance was no longer friendly, and Steve refused to even come talk to me. I ended up leaving with plates in hand (apparently theyre incapable of putting them on) and no resolution to my problem.

She called and they made the appointment the same day yesterday.  They told her that her oil needed to be changed and she should have came in before then.  They said they were going to change it and hopefully that would fix the problem and she did not come in too late.  So they changed the oil and told her to come back in 2 months so they could make sure they got out all the sludge from the oil.  The car worked great after the oil change.  They could have taken advantage of her because she knows nothing about cars but they did not.  She left paying only $15.00 dollars.  I appreciate the customer service she received! ,4.8

87,"June 01, 2018","**UPDATE:  Kia of South Austin has rectified the outstanding lease turn-in situation...albeit six months after the transaction should have been completed.  I appreciate Vu Le (Sales Manager) accepting responsibility on behalf of the dealership and making good on what what discussed in December 2017.  I'm giving the single star because of Mr. Le, otherwise I would give zero stars.
**UPDATE: Six months later and the lease transaction is STILL NOT COMPLETE!  As an update to my initial review below - used sales manager of dealership told me general manager agreed to pay outstanding amount in Jan. 2018.  Apparently they never sent payment and I was just NOW contacted by Kia Finance that payment is still due. This is an absolute joke that this is still happening. 
 **UPDATE:  Used car manager has finally reached out to discuss.  Salesperson has now gotten involved as well (still never heard a peep from finance director).  Issue is not completely resolved...but this is a start.  Note to dealer employees - acknowledge and communicate with your clients.  Will update once entire transaction is complete.Lease transaction still not complete...a month after signing lease docs!  This should have been a relatively painless turn-in of my leased Kia Sportage, and roll into a new Kia lease. I have top-tier credit and my Sportage was in excellent condition and under miles. Salesperson was a positive and helpful guy.  Negotiation and even the dreaded finance signing was pretty smooth and was happy leaving the dealership with my new 2017 Kia Optima Hybrid. That's when it all went downhill. Got a call from the finance director the following day to ask me to come back in to resign part of my lease documents. IMPORTANT: they had failed to include  payment of my outstanding lease balance on the documents, which was part of the car negotiation. Had no issue going back in to resign. Just happy it was caught. Finance director was clearly aware that they were to make the remaining payment (even have an email chain between us confirming the same)...and 30 days later do you think that payment has been made? Nope.  It was supposed to have been paid within 20 days of transaction. We are past 20 business days. I have left voicemails and sent emails to the finance director without any contact. This is unacceptable that it has even gotten to this point. I went back to Kia because I had such an amazing experience leasing my Sportage from another dealer (in another state), another early-lease turn in with ZERO issues. I am disheartened this time around.  ",1.0

200,"August 15, 2017","About three weeks ago, I took my 2011 Sorento to the Kia of South Austin dealership to get two recalls fixed and to figure out why the check engine light is on. Turns out the check engine light issue is something that is covered under two other recalls for Sorentos. One covers Sorentos from 2012-2014 and the other covers a different type of 2011 Sorentos. So this is a well known issue but unfortunately it could not be covered under recall. 

Lucky for me, I have two different warranties and one of those warranties should have covered the issue. I made 30+ phone calls between the Austin dealership and the Chicago dealership (where I purchased it). Austin assured me that they called the warranty company and I did not have any warranty. But no worries, they offered to do the repair work for 15% off. Chicago assured me they called the warranty company and I do have a valid warranty. One of these dealerships was clearly lying.

I left negative reviews for both dealerships and within a few hours I figured out which dealership was lying. It was the Austin dealership. The GM from the Chicago dealership had to call the Austin dealership and explain to them that I do, in fact, have a warranty and this issue is covered under warranty. 

Finally, Austin agreed to do the repair work. I had to wait 4-5 days for them to order a part. I dropped my car off on Monday night. My car was supposed to be ready Tuesday. Nobody even bothered to call on Tuesday. At 5pm, I called and was on hold for 25 minutes before I was informed no one in the service department could take my call. I relayed this to the Chicago GM, who was able to contact the Austin dealership within 10 minutes. Odd that he could get someone to pick up the phone but I couldn’t. Anyway, of course my car was not ready.

I still don’t have a car. Who knows when it will be ready and if they will actually fix the problem? 

But here’s what I do know. Because of this experience, I will never buy a Kia again. If you would have told me that it would take over 20 hours of work (and counting!) just to try to convince Kia to honor a contract, I never would have bought one in the first place.",1.0

I found my truck had been moved, they took it to the back to clean, and wouldn't you know all of my stuff inside my truck was gone, truck sitting their unlocked!

I drove to Kia of South Austin to look at some upgrade vans for my large family - they had ample stock and were in an area teeming with dealerships. We arrived just after the dealership opened on Saturday morning.

Esteban Alanis greeted us outside very warmly - literally. The heat was BLISTERING that day, but Esteban never showed that it affected him. He waited patiently for us outside while to transferred three car seats for a test drive (before we signed the paperwork) and while we transferred our belongings to our new vehicle from the old one (after we signed the lease). Esteban took the time to go over all of the amazing features in my new vehicle; he listened intently and was responsive to our questions. While we sat in his office, he was pleasant and always kept us updated on where we were in the car-leasing process (which was completely new to us). 

Another salesperson brought balloons to our young children while we waited - THANK YOU to whoever that was! You are a life saver. There is obviously a family-friendly culture being developed here.

We settled on leasing a brand new Sedona - something I was certain I'd never be able to afford - after talking to Director James, who is upbeat, relatable, and obviously knowledgeable. The staff really came together and worked some amazing deals for us; we are under our previous car payment and have a MUCH nicer van than before. Make-ready on my new vehicle was perfect.

Tara in finance did a great job explaining the paperwork. I went into her office first while my husband stayed in the waiting area with our children, and then I waited while he signed the lease. Tara had no problem explaining the terms twice and was very accommodating and friendly. She thoroughly explained the details of our warranties and dent/ding/interior repair ""insurance"". This is an excellent investment, especially for those planning to lease.

I was very impressed with my experience at Kia of South Austin, and will definitely be back when it's time to trade in another vehicle. Thank you Esteban, James, and Tara!",5.0
217,"December 15, 2015","I am foreigner person, so i did not know how 'scamy' process of buying car could be in US.

So this dealership take advantage of it completely.
In details
1) When you speak with sales person/sales manager they discussed with you one terms/payments. When you come to sign papers its completely different terms, with different financing, with additional options. In my case what i end up paying was 30% more per month than what we discuss with sales person (1900$ package, with market value around 700$ as previous reviewer say it's only one trick, they have more of that)
2) They give me terrible price on trade in, saying that they give me a discount on new car, which turned out to be not discount, but lowering warranty terms. 
3) They give me trade in paper to sign, before i see real terms on new car. So when i realize how bad deal is, i basically out of options (they already own my old car, so only option was go home on my legs)
4)They are not interested in giving your optimal financing terms, because of affiliation with banks. When i start to be angry, finance guy spend like 2 min with bank representative in online chat and lower my interest a bit. I bet he can do even more, but dealership seems to have some sort of commission, so they are interested in give you high possible interest rate you will agreed on.

Why 2 star's? Because staff is generally friendly and positive. Answer your questions e.t.c.
So if you plan to go here, it will be positive experience if you do your home work

1)You should know fair price of vehicle you want to buy
2)You should know fair price of traded in vehicle (your old car)
3)You should know fair financing terms applicable to you(better to look like as cash buyer)
4)You should know fair pricing of different car options (car maintenance over year e.t.c)
5)Dont ever sign anything before you got full package of documents and you see all terms clearly
(it happens in place they called 'finance', where person hand you over loan terms on bank paper)
6)Always be ready to just stand up and leave if you dont like something

If you will follow this rules you will have good experience with them, otherwise you will end up paying extra on every step of the process.

219,"August 11, 2014","I have been looking to purchase a used van for a few weeks and have done a lot of research. I used the USAA Car Buying service to find my next ride.... this place was listed, and after several back and forth emails and being told by JD to come in and let's make a deal, I drove the 2 hours to see what we could do.... What a MISTAKE!!

When I arrived, JD was (conveniently) making a delivery, so after waiting about 10 minutes, Anthony came to help. He informed me that he would ""Take good care of me"" and that he was their ""Top Salesman"" (he did have several plaques on the wall in his cubicle to back that claim.)

We went for a test drive -- No problem. 
It wasn't until we returned that the REAL problems began....
I'd asked about seeing another vehicle -- we never got to that, because things got ugly quick! After my vehicle was appraised with an extremely low offer, I presented Anthony with my documentation showing it's book value. He then brought that upstairs to their (OPEN) area where I guess employees do their ""negotiations"" for potential customers.... that's when it ALL fell apart! I kept hearing things like ""She xxxxxx"" this and ""xxxxxx"" that. I even heard a female employee, unrelated to my transaction, who was clearly wearing shoes not appropriate for her line of work, say loudly, ""I xxxxxx hate these stairs!"" as she stumbled down them.

I told Anthony that we were finished and that I'd like my keys back. He went back upstairs for MORE cursing, ( ""She just wants her xxxxxx keys back"" and ""She xxxxxx"" this.) Next thing I know, a guy who claims to be the manager, (I didn't catch his name because at this point, I didn't care,) comes downstairs asking how he can help. I told him that was the most unprofessional dealership I'd ever been to and that I'd like my keys back. He didn't want to hand them over , and instead wanted to have a conversation,  but I was FINISHED, so I grabbed my keys and began walking out. When I told him I could hear their conversations upstairs along with all of the cursing,  he claimed that he wasn't a part of it and didn't know anything... even though he'd just walked downstairs! 
Regardless, as the ""Manager"" he's responsible for the behavior and conduct of his employees, and I doubt very seriously that he's ""unaware"" of their behavior and use of profanity. 

I drove 2 hours (ONE WAY!) because they had a vehicle I was interested in and I was assured that I'd be taken care of.... NOT the case!!
Those people are representing a large car maker who has a good reputation. I expected MUCH better.
I will NEVER set foot there again, and I will be SURE to let USAA know how a business they are referring their customers to treats people.

What if I am in the middle of the desert or in the Idaho mountains?  I would be waiting for hours!  This is a safety issue that any buyer can't put a spare tire on and continue on their way.

Other objections are that of course Ben Boyle didn't tell me there isn't a spare tire - leaving me totally vulnerable.  And, I can only buy a spare tire and jack for $250!!!!  Ben didn't care.  Both said this is now a ""trend"" with automobile sales to save money and for weight of the veheicle.  Something as important as a spare tire and jack?  We are phoning other dealerships.  So far, Nissan and Mazda both provide spare tires in ALL of their cars.

Because they didn't notify us when we purchased the car (which is called honesty and safety) and because we have to spend another $250 for something that should have been included and as much as we like Shawn Hamze, we will not buy a vehicle at Southpoint Kia again.  And we will stop recommending them to other people.",2.0
223,"March 03, 2014","Worked with them to get my daughter into a new car. First they tried to sell it to her for $3000 over the fair market value. I had to get on the phone to negotiate it down to where it should be. Both the sales rep, Chuy, and the Financial Department were very deceitful in their dealings with us. I was to co-sign for my daughter on this car. Although they never told us this, they knew my daughter's credit was not as good as mine, so they put me as as primary applicant instead of co-applicant to get the loan. Even though I questioned how the paperwork seemed to have me as primary, they assured me it was just an oversight when their girl typed it up for them and that it would be fine to sign as is. So I did. Turns out - it was NOT an oversight - it was their deceitful bait & switch tactics to get the car sold. We didn't find out until the loan payments came in. I just talked to the bank and they did indeed pull a fast one. I suggest that no one EVER deal with this Kia dealership. Kia won't do anything about it because they claim their dealerships are independently owned. Horrible customer service on the part of Kia as a whole. STAY AWAY FROM SOUTH POINT KIA IN SAN MARCOS",1.4
224,"December 21, 2013","Today was my third Saturday in a row being at the service department trying to resolve one issue. My first visit, I waited for 90 minutes just to find out 'oh, we forgot about your car'. When I finally got the diagnosis, I didn't have time to fix the issue and said I would come back the following Saturday. It then took an additional 30 minutes to get paperwork ready for me to pay the $50 diagnostic fee. Second visit, I dropped the car off for the repairs and a few hours later got a call that I could come get my car. When I picked up my car, the tire pressure light was on and my Blu tooth was not working. They put some air in my tires and the receptionist fixed my Blu tooth (I thought it was odd that the receptionist did this and not a technician, but it got fixed). When I got home, I looked under the hood to check the repairs and surprisingly found I had just wasted another Saturday and money on electrical tape. They tried to cover up the wires I needed fixed with electrical tape (which has now melted and made a mess because it was not even clipped back into place) Third Saturday, I go in to complain and was told they repaired the wires correctly but should not have put tape over it. So, I waited another two hours for them to put conduit over these wires and put it back into place. When I questioned the manager regarding the customer service I received I was told 'Ya, I know. It sucks' 'Sorry you had to come back' Really? That's the best you can say/do for me? For me, to exemplify great customer service, like they say they do, he could have offered something simple like a free oil change or car wash (at the very least) for my trouble. I shouldn't have to check the repair work I'm paying you to do. This makes me wonder, what other things they have they half fixed and gotten away with?   I dread the next time I have to take my car here.",1.8
225,"October 12, 2013",This is our third Kia we have purchased from South Point Kia.  The three times I have always done my research and look for the best deals possible.  The three times I have ended buying from South Point Kia and always from Shawn.  Technology helps in the research and it has become easy to find great deals when purchasing a car in the recent years.  I believe it has become more important now for dealerships to provide not only good deals but also a personal touch that will bring buyers to their place.  The three times I have visited and purchased from South Pointy Kia I have felt comfortable and relaxed which has helped me during my decision.  Shawn is very genuine and a humble man who reminds us of another family man who is honestly trying to do his best.  It is a pleasure ding business with Shawn.     ,5.0
226,"October 09, 2013","Buying our new car at South Point Kia was a very positive experience.  Shawn Hamze was exceptional and made buying
a new car a fun experience.

He had all the paperwork ready for us and made us feel like an important customer instead of a number.

Not only was the car ready for us, we drove over from Houston, it even had a full tank of gas.  What a class act as most dealers
would not do this.

Shawn even took the time to explain the features, and even programed my wife's cell into the Blue Tooth.

Then when we left for our ride back to Houston, we were supplied with a cold bottle of water for the trip.

I would highly recommend South Point Kia to my friends.

He was so efficient, and I am still in shock that the entire purchase was done so quickly and easily! It was the best car buying experience ever! We are more than happy and satisfied with our new Soul, and he was able to put us in the exact vehicle we wanted. Very awesome experience altogether.

We test drove a 2013 Sorento in our area and fell in love, but it was way over priced and had 14,000 miles already on it. I  contacted Shawn late on a sunday night and he got back to me monday morning! I told him our situation, what we found already and that we wanted to find a better deal. He looked up the car that the dealer around here was trying to sell us and assured us that he'd get us a better deal. He kept in contact with me that whole day and updated me with what he had in stock and patiently waited for our response as to whether we wanted to move forward or not. My husband wound up getting off of work late and by the time we got to the dealership it was closing in 1 hour. Shawn waited there for us and made sure we got what we wanted, and worked an hour past closing time. Our monthly payments are a few dollars more than what we were expecting, but we got a BRAND NEW Sorento with 0 miles on it with a great interest rate! I couldn't be happier with our new car!",4.8

It was about 6:30 when we left with us at a stalemate.  Shawn stated that he was going to work for us and we would close the deal the next day.  He called Tuesday morning to remind us to return; that he had a deal.  My mother and I returned that night and Shawn once again stayed past 6pm.  He told us the final purchase price plus the payments.  It was an amount that we could work with and we closed the deal.

Also, Kia was running a special if you financed through them at 2.9% anyway. When I told them the numbers didn't look right, they played with the price on the vehicle, the APR percent, and loan term trying to convince me they could &amp;quot;fight to reduce my APR,&amp;quot; that a 63 month loan term existed, and that they could get my monthly payments down to a number that was &amp;quot;within my budget.&amp;quot; It's a shame they tried to take advantage of me and were so dishonest.

265,"April 06, 2012","I came here after a horrible experience with Capitol Kia. I had gotten my own financing approved through my credit union (UFCU). Capitol could do absolutely nothing to meet my needs and even bad mouthed South Point as I told them that is where I was headed. Well I pulled up to South Point and parked directly in front of my sales man (Jason Morris). As I got out of my car, HE WAITED FOR ME TO APPROACH HIM! Once I did, I told him that I had been pre-approved through my bank, I told him the terms I needed, the car I wanted and how much I needed for trade in on my current vehicle. Without any kind of dispute or haggling, Jason's reply was &quot;lets go pick out your car.&quot; I already knew exactly which car I wanted so I picked it out and told him if he can meet MY TERMS then we have a deal. We went to his office where I filled out minimal paper work. In a little less than 10 minutes, Jason returned with an approval of MY TERMS. No going back and forth between me and his manager. He didn't come back 5 times with a different amount that was still not what I needed. Jason came back one time and one time only with the approval that I NEEDED and was able to get what I needed on my trade in, which was $2000 more than Capitol Kia said was their &quot;absolute highest&quot; offer was. After signing all the paper work and agreements (finalizing the sale) I was literally about to drive off the lot in my new car, when all of the sudden the finance manager (Jamie Morris) comes running up to me. He told me that he needed me to resign the paperwork because he had made some changes... Instantly I thought I was about to get Jerked around. As I was going over the new purchase agreement, I realized the only thing that had changed was the total price, it had gone down by $1,005. I asked for further explanation and Jamie's response was, &quot;I was about to put the deal through when I realized that I could do better.&quot; The sale was completely final and I was about to pull off the lot when he stopped me, just to save me an extra $1,005 on the total price of the car. Something that he did not have to do and I never would of known otherwise, but he did it anyways. I can't say enough good things about my overall experience, salesman (Jason Morris), finance manager (Jamie Morris) or South Point Kia in general. I really wish I would have gone here first instead of wasting my time at Capitol. South Point really made me feel comfortable, as well as did Jason. I didn't feel pressured at all and it was the best overall experience I've ever had buying or shopping for a new car! I highly recommend this dealership to anyone in need of a new or used car. Especially if you are trying to trade in and get out from under something. They are straight shooters that aren't going to sell you something you don't want just for a sale. They want the sale, but it is evident that they want you to be satisfied more. GREAT JOB SOUTH POINT KIA AND THANK YOU FOR MY NEW CAR, I LOVE IT!!!",5.0

In November Taylor Brannen, Internet Marketing Coordinator, South Point Hyundai & KIA
responded to me about that previous review above and reached out to me to give them another chance. I took Taylor up on this offer and did return. I am happy to say they exceeded my expectations and wanted to make it known that I am a satisfied customer now because of the attention put forth by the South Point Kia management team and staff to make sure my customer issues were resolved.

I appreciated SP Kia reaching out to me after reading my review on my previous customer service experience at SP Kia. I can joyfully say my second experience was a 180 turnaround and cannot express more how delighted I was this time. It was a great customer experience overall and I want to send my gratitude to the Service Manager Jim Raney and his staff for an excellent job and service provided to me and my 2011 Kia Optima. Outstanding is how I would rate my satisfaction.  I want to thank you again for the effort put forth on this issue to make it right is very commendable and it shows me that the management team DOES listen to their customers. It gives me the confidence now to come back and do business with SP Kia knowing that the current staff and management team is making sure customer service is a top priority as it should be. Job well done. Thanks again!",5.0
289,"January 15, 2012","Wow!!! I'd like to say that this was my greatest experience in a dealership since we came from Puerto Rico to Texas. I was kind of septic about visiting another dealership due to all the negative ways we have been treated in the past.  My husband convinced me that we go to South Point Kia in Austin since we are living in San Antonio, he had spoken to a Spanish speaking rep named Eric and explained what he wanted.  When we got there, Eric greeted us politely and directed us specifically to what we asked for respecting the fact we had a budget limit and worked with us giving us a satisfactory result. Enrique was the Sales Consultant who took us through the process, a very nice person who made us feel welcome.  Ali Fawaz is the Finance Director a very professional person who helped us with payment options and worked around to meet our budget...I am definitely going to recommend South Point Kia to others.

294,"January 03, 2012","5 years ago I bought a Kia Spectra from Shawn Hamze.  He listened to what I wanted, got me a car at a fair price and I drove away feeling I had been treated fairly and professionally.  I never had a problem with the car and it was up to 106,000.  My son's 10 year old car finally died beyond repair last week.  He had been driving it since high school and had not had the experience of buying a car himself so we went to the dealership and asked for Shawn Hamze.  He welcomed me back like an old family friend and made my son feel at ease going through the process of buying a car for the first time.  My son gave him a price range for the car and monthly payments so he went online and found 3 vehicles that fit the requirements for the used car he wanted to buy.  He showed all 3 of them to us and described the warrantees the did or didn't still have, the features and the milage.  He did mention new cars in the same price range but once my son said he was not interested in a new car he focused on the used cars and didn't mention it again.  We took 2 of the cars for a test drive and made the decision and the paper work started.  The finance person did ask within a date range what date he wanted to make his monthly payment.  THey got the payment at a range he could afford.  We were in and out in about 2 hours.  As we were looking around at cars I got interested in looking at one to replace my car that has 106,000 miles on it.  I went back 2 days later and worked with Shawn again to find a car for me.  I wanted a new car with no frills and that's what he found for me.  I had a bit of a balance on my old car and they paid it off and did the paper work to take care of all the rest of it to get everything paid off and transferred.  All the staff I dealt with were friendly, knowledgable and happy to help you in any way they could.  I did not feel high pressure from any of them.  I would definitely recommend them again.",5.0

300,"December 08, 2011","I was on my way to Truck City in Buda as I know the father of the General Manager there. I had an appt with them and I always take my Dad with me on major purchases as I value his opinion. I called my father to let him know I was on my way to Truck City but he said to call Kia and get you a new car!? before you go and call me back. I called Kia and was connected with Mr. Fernandez. Over the phone, I gave him a brief scenrio about what I had to work with regarding my credit and what I had been approved from my credit union. He encouraged me to come down to Kia and that he knew he could help me get a better deal that the one Truck City was giving me for a pre-owned vehicle. I told him I would be there within the hour but if I didn't like what I was hearing or seeing I was headed to Truck City. I called my Dad back and told me to meet me at Kia.

As I pulled into SouthPoint and saw the cars I was beginning to feel somewhat hopeful. A young man walked up to my rental car and asked if he could assist me...I told him I was here to see Jose Fernandez which he was standing fairly close to where I was parked. He came over and was very polite and asked me what type of car was I looking for? I told a sedan mainly but something I could afford but with a better APR that my bank and Truck City had given me. I also said my Dad seems to believe I could get a new car from you guys. But remember I have an appt with Truck City and he told me ""you're not going to need that appt with Truck City"" then he asked me if I was familiar with the Kia Rio and there just happened to be one of two 2012 on the lot...I told him I thought they might be to small but let me see. He showed me the Rio 5door. He was very knowledgeable about the specifics of the car. But I didn't want to get into details as I was waiting on my Dad to arrive. He didn't push me but coaxed me into sitting in the Rio the front seat area was good. He gave me to key to start it up. I was telling him my granddaughter's carseat may take up too much room and anyone with height may not be comfortable in the back. Mr. Fernandez said he was 6ft and got in the back seat to make his point that the back seat was indeed roomy. Making sure his knees were not in the driverside back with the driver side seat pushed all the way back. Finally my Dad arrived and then asked if I wanted to test drive it. I said sure..He said I could get on I35...I liked the way it fit and it was handling on the road. He talked about more of the bells and whistles that the car was equipted to do. He showed me how the back seat would lay down to give greater trunk space if needed. He told me he owned a Kia and that he and his family were please with their car. No major problems. He explained how to get greater benefit from maintaining the keep of the car at Kia. He introduced me to one Jim Raney from the maintainence department. He too was extremely nice warm and friendly to us.

I was pretty much sold on the Rio. I really like the way it felt. We started paperwork and we sat down with Peggy. She too was extremely nice and very knowledgeable and easy to understand regarding the warranties. I was excited to know that I could get financing for the Rio. I didn't feel as though I was being smoozed just to make a sale but Mr. Fernandez,Ms. Peggy and Jim Raney were genuinely nice people. After the signage of paperwork, Mr. Fernandez had the car already for me. He helped me take my things from the rental car to ""my"" Rio. I drove off the lot extremely satisfied with my new purchase. The first brand new car for me ever...I've always had pre-owned cars and that all changed for me.

Mr. Fernandez gave me a follow up call earlier today actual left me a very nice message as I missed his call. But I am happy to share my wonderful experience of  NON-hard/hassle sale but of a passionate knowledgeable information with facts that I believe helped me make a great informed decision on a major purchase.

With my low credit score, I knew I shouldn’t be so picky or difficult but these guys help steer you in the right direction, not just ‘sell a car’. He will ask you to write a review for him, and that’s a small thing to ask for after all that he’s done. Even if he you don’t buy a vehicle from him, he’ll help you in getting financed for one.

First issue I had is that I found out there is a known issue on the model car I purchased with the alignment pulling to left over 60mph. Kia even has a Technical Bulletin on the issue TSB032. South Point Kia had my car on the lot for 4 months prior to me purchasing it and did not resolve the known issue while on the lot and let me drive off after purchase with this potential safety issue. When I approached the dealer about it they even refused to provide a loaner while the repair they failed to make is resolved. Second issue is instead of mailing my Registration Tags, they sent me a post card to pick them up.  So I made the extra trip up there thinking I will just have them install the tags. No such luck!. The receptionist handed me the tags and I asked for the Salesperson to install them and was informed he was busy and to drive to service lane. I went to the service lane and was informed they would get to me in the next hour. An hour to install tags on a car! That's inexcusable. I do not recommend this dealer as they are only sales driven and have no idea what a good customer experience is. They just don't care.",1.3
316,"April 12, 2011","After a terrible experience at Capitol Kia on 183, I was without a car for 4 days. I was really stressed about having to start the whole process over again. I took some time to read the reviews about the other Kia dealership in Austin, South Point Kia. I saw that Shawn Hamze had great reviews overall and decided to email him before wasting any time on the lot. I told him exactly what car I wanted and exactly what I wanted to pay per month for ""x"" amount of months. The price per month that I requested was the same price I had asked the finance guy at Capitol Kia for…at Capitol Kia the finance guy told us that he would “loose his job if he offered that price”. Somehow magically, Shawn was able to offer us that price and he was able to do it without any haggling or “stepping out to talk to the manager” and he still has his job. Wow…it’s a miracle. Shawn responded to my email within 30 minutes, assured me he could meet our needs and started the financing paperwork over the phone so that we wouldn’t waste time at the dealership. Shawn never tried to sale me on a different car or different product. He never tried to sale me a lease instead of a finance contract. He quickly made my wishes into a reality and was very laid back the entire time we were meeting with him. He gave me a brand new car that had just been unwrapped from the factory with 4 miles on it. He had it detailed and filled it up with gas. It’s a black 2011 Kia Sorento LX and it is beautiful. While waiting for the financing guy to be freed up he took the time to walk through all of the warranty info and car info. The financing guy did not pull any tricks during our time with him. He filled out the contract exactly as Shawn had said it would be filled out which was a new experience for us. At capitol Kia the salesperson would promise things would go down one way in financing and the financing guy would come up with paperwork that was nothing like the salesperson promised so you would have to start all over again. We were so relieved when everything went easily in financing. South Point Kia was not pushy, the transaction went smoothly and they showed us how buying a new car is supposed to go. My husband and I were very happy with our entire experience at South Point Kia and specifically with Shawn Hamze as our salesperson. I highly recommend that you give Shawn a try, especially if you are walking away from a bad Capitol Kia 183 experience. If you want a no-haggling, drama free, mistake free, stress free car buying experience make the drive to South Point Kia or just email Shawn at sh102070@yahoo.com to see what he can do for you. ",5.0
317,"January 03, 2011","My husband and I had the BEST experience ever with Shawn Hamze and Jose. I had found a vehicle that I liked online and immediately called Shawn. We made an appt., I test drove the car and I was able to take my new car home for Christmas! It was EASY!
I had done my homework before and went in with lots of questions, but before I could even ask, Shawn was already giving me more information than what I had needed. The communication was easy and very thoughtful. I appreciate everyone that helped us out and all the wonderful customer service that we received. I have already told me friends and family to go to Shawn and the team at South Point Kia. I seriously do not want to deal with any other dealership here in town for the rest of my days. My next car will be a brand new one from there and I cannot wait!
Thanks for the wonderful experience!",5.0
318,"August 12, 2010","This dealership is ,BY FAR, THE most dishonest, scam artist dealership my husband and I have EVER come in contact with!  They tried to bait and switch us twice!  Promised us a deal that we were happy with and then tried to give us a Dealer Owned vehicle with 5000 miles on it without telling us.  Then, when we didn't want it, they increased the price on the same vehicle and came back to us like we were getting the deal of the century.  They promised us their showroom DVD package (witnessed by 3 of us) and installed a $300 DVD that was such low quality that they would not begin to suit our needs! They took my husband into their finance office that had ""no working cameras"" at the time, said what ever sounded good, had my husband sign and upon finding out several lies and overcharges, none of what the finance person said could be proven! They charged us in total $7,000.00 OVER sticker and, upon asking for an itemization of the charges, the finance person, Jose admitted that it was pure profit after trying to convince us it was for the ""after-market tint"" which ALL Sorento's and most SUV's come with darkened windows straight from the factory!  We witnessed two of the Sales Persons Travis and Jarrod tell us that we would be getting the showroom DVD players and now Travis does not recall saying that and Jarrod told my husband he remembered saying it but has to ""confer"" with the rest of the team which basically means that they will come back and say they never said that!

BUYER BEWARE!!!  I'm a wife and a mother of a four year old.  We live paycheck to paycheck like a lot of other people!  This dealership took advantage in the biggest way!",1.0
319,"April 18, 2010","I can't speak as to the service, having purchased the car this past week, but the sales experience was the most agreeable I've ever had with a dealership. After visiting the north side Kia dealership and getting the old ""If you buy it today here's what I can do for you . . ."" spiel, we found the low pressure atmosphere at Southpoint a welcome relief. Steven explained the features and answered our questions without any hyperbole and sat quietly as we took the car out and discussed its features. We always felt he was being honest with us. We took a friend with us who wanted to finance her car and Kia gave her what appears to be an excellent loan at a competitive rate of interest. We left with two Kia Souls. Will continue to document our experience, but so far so good!",4.8
320,"December 14, 2009","Rude, pushy liars. Unbelievable. We purchased from them, and then were obligated to go to them for warranty issues.  They tricked and lied to us. Took in day after buying it b/c the breaks were squeaking. They said ""breaks squeak"". Several weeks later, took it back  ""oh you need new breaks"" and that's just routine maintenance, so you will have to pay for it.  Then, we were going to take it elsewhere, but they fixed them anyways, lied to my husband, and on and on and on. THEN had the nerve to call me to ask me how the service had been. I told him everything, he in so many words call me a liar, and told me ""too bad"" he can't control other people if they don't follow through, etc... WTF? Several problems with the kia already, new breaks, new battery and something about the gas tank.  Don't buy from these people. I regret it big time!",1.8
321,"July 24, 2009","These people, especially the manager are rude and condescending. If I ran this service station ever person there would be fired. We will never bring our KIA to this dealership ever again. Everyone giving 5's above, wait until you have an issue. You will see the true nature of this piece of crap dealership. We regret the purchase of this car from this dealership. I have never dealt with worse customer service. The manager of this station should be ashamed. The Owner/GM of this dealership should be even more ashamed. WE had a piece fall off our car, and happened to be in the area. Our car was still under warranty and they wouldn't so much as step outside to take a look at it. It was our only means of transportation and they wanted us to leave the car there for at least a week. Turns out it was just a plastic part on the air intake which was lodged down in the engine. We asked if they had something we could fidh it out with and were promptly met with more rude comments and actions. Luckily we found something in the car we could use but it took much longer. We were finally able to fix it our self. Heaven forbid this piece of crap manager leave his AC'ed office. This place is joke and should be shut down. Do not purchase a car, let alone bring one here for service.

Always refused warranty work. Always asked ""who is going to pay for this"" when items were part of the contract. I can go on forever.   ",1.0
322,"June 10, 2009",After dealing with the complete waste of time at the competitor capitol kia.  I came to south point kia expecting the same type of treatment.  However I was supprised upon arrival when the sales person was very curtious and excited about the product.  I was looking for a new kia soul.  They had 5 to choose from but I did not like any of the colors they had.  So JD told me to find one that is equiped like I wanted for us to test drive and that he would go get the car for me.  I drove the one I liked and went in to work the deal.  There was no BS $2200 fee for tint or tire protection either.  I agree to a fair price and asked how much it was going to cost to go get from another dealer.  He said that they would not charge me for it.  WOW I was supprised that I got a good deal on the exact car I was wanting.  I signed my paperwork and they gave me a car to drive overnight while mine came in.  The next day the car arrived and was clean and full of gas when I came to pick it up.  This is the first time I have ever had a good experiance with a car dealer.,5.0

324,"April 19, 2007","when i went to this dealership thay lied to me over the phone and told me that thay could help me get out of the car that i was in, thay could not do no such thing, what thay did do was jack the price up on me from the msrp and thay tried to tell me that my apr was going to be 10.95 when i have great credit when i went to capitol kia they did not just get me out of the car but they got me a much better apr then the one i was given here",1.0
