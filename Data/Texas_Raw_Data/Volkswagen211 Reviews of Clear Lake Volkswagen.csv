2,"June 17, 2020",My husband had initially gone into the dealership to browse vehicles back in March 2020. Riley Craddock was his sales associate. He explained to her that he was looking and pricing and wasn't ready at the moment but would be around June or July 2020. She proceeded to give him outstanding customer service even though he was browsing. Needless to say when we came back this past weekend and we sought her out. Again we initially were not intending to purchase at this time but Riley was exceptional and proceeded to answer all of our questions and went above and beyond to see if she could find the vehicle we were looking for. Everything fell into place and we found a vehicle and a deal we just could not pass up. Thank you Riley for making this a positive car buying experience. ,4.8

6,"February 11, 2020","Brevin, the Sales person that handled selling me the 2019 Jetta SEL was outstanding, but the business mgr, (forgot his name and that is OK ), but they know who I speak of at the dearlership is NOT a friendly person of sorts.  Maybe it was because I took care of my own financing with my credit union back in Louisiana (even my credit union rep) also commented to me about the vibe she was getting from him. Friendliness rating below is a result of dealing with him.",3.6

32,"October 25, 2019","If the owner would have returned my call perhaps I might have made a different decision not to write this negative review.  Sir, it only took 2 days to be declined from the tire and wheel plan. The rest of the 14 days was waiting on service to replace 2 tires,  so get your story straight!  Your team needs replacing or more training. ",1.8

Plus, my vehicle was washed after servicing!",5.0
35,"October 17, 2019","the service department sucks even more then clear lake Honda and I thought they were the worst I took my 2013 vw beetle turbo s 2.o to get the recall for the computer I got home all the warning lights came on call and they said to leave it to the next day long story short this is what a vw mechanic said to me......As long as they don’t clear them, it will still be there. Make sure you tell them that a P0606 is a processor fault which means the ECU needs to be replaced. They should even be able to pull a freeze frame to see when it popped up in relation to when they did the recall. 

If I had to guess, I’d say that when they flashed your ECU, it fried the processor. Which happens, even to me. But they should be responsible for replacing it.my turbo is not working properly or at all the service Alejandro say that never happened to them that's is bull my car wend from 1 code to 12 codes dont take ur cat there they will most it up and my car was running fine before it there we got a lease there for a tiguan wend its done we are donewhit them",1.0

39,"October 05, 2019",The entire sales team that we dealt with was professional and kind.  They tailored the sales experience to our needs and were patient throughout.   I hate buying new cars because to often the sales team are pushing and live up to the stereotype.

43,"September 18, 2019","I had the worst experience I have ever had in a dealership last night. I have purchased more than 8 VW's/Audi's from Momentum (Sonic Automotive) and one from Demontrond in the past, all with great experiences. Under new ownership, Clear Lake now appears to be a terrible bait and switch dealership. They advertise a price and discount (comparable to other dealerships in town) on their website and other sites with no disclaimers, but then will not honor it in store. I even requested confirmation of pricing twice before coming out to the dealership. Brandon, the sales manager, even questioned my ability to do math when they were showing me a price that is more than $5k over their advertised discounted price. I have never had a dealership not offer their online advertised price before - with the obvious exceptions of the college and military credits. Do not believe Clear Lake VW's website. Do not get scammed. Do not take your business here. VW's are still great cars, just go to any other dealership to purchase or service.",1.0

The same tint that was on the car when I bought it and that they had inspected and PASSED.  Yes you heard that right the same tint that they passed the previous year.

66,"December 07, 2018",Worst experience I have ever had. Took the car in for a timing issue. Paid 500$ for them to say “yes. The timing is off” and that it would be $5800 to repair. Looking at the price list they marked THEIR OWN parts up 25% and told me I needed a entire new head when they never took anything but one timing chain cover off. They lied to me and told me they inspected the tensioner but never took the lower cover off. Just quoted me an entire new engine because they didn’t want to deal with it.

Bought an Atlas SEL premium today from McCracken VW (they were awesome! Buying another Monday) in Longview, and are so glad we are in Katy and do not have to bring our Atlas here for service. 1 Star for friendliest because the guy who appraised our car was condescending.

70,"September 29, 2017","Decided to buy a car on September 13 2017 ... that was the first mistake. After haggling a little bit with my trade in and asking about price difference on same exact vehicle from different dealers, they kept changing numbers on the new Tiguan and their figures of everything. Mind you this same vehicle is on their site for $33, 911 while Other dealers and VW website have it for $32,544. We signed papers but did not receive our copy that night.   The next day we tried to just return the vehicle as we didn't put any money down and thought they'd work with us on that...NOPE. so when we finally got our contract in hand, I noticed the base price of the vehicle is now  $34,949!!!!! what the heck! So BUYER BEWARE check your papers because they are out to take as much money from you as possible....OH and did I mention the base price for the 2018 Tiguan SEL for the specific one I got was $33,955....yes alityle over a 1000 less than what they put on our contract.

First ball face tail he told ..and the car was listed at $13,900...he's a very poor sales manager if he got the car at $12,950 and it's gonna spend $700 on recon and sale it for few hundred dollars over... not good business sense ..And I can honestly admit that the car was extremely clean and drove well..... in addition he told me he knew I was trying to get a deal but Houston is flooded with over 750,000 cars...he wasn't budging on the price one penny SOOOOO.....good luck !!!!!!!!!!!  Now believe me he didn't say any of the statements what a general smile he was extremely rude obnoxious actually Now as a consumer I can appreciate the business wanting to make a profit but when a manager is that rude then I have a problem with that I would never buy another car from sonic automotive and I would never refer anyone to a sonic automotive store... the sad part about the whole thing is you could've negotiated the sale in addition the sales person stood there and dismay.....apparently there's no secret that his behavior happens on a regular basis.....and I am a sales manager 
I could never treat a customer that way...the car was not for me it was a referral the young lady was preapproved at her credit union...earlier today I spoke to a DAVID Fulwiler.....followed up with me and asked me to come in and then I met Matt which was very nice sales person.... very bad experience ......",1.0

73,"May 15, 2017","First off, this is one of the most unprofessional dealership I have ever dealt with in my entire life. From conversations using profanity to empty/false promises, this dealership do not stand by their words. 

I'm surprised Momentum have not dropped this branch from their branding. This branch is defaming the Momentum name (which the other Momentum dealerships are more courtesy, friendly, knowledgeable and professional). The way this branch operates is like a mama-papa shop. 

The manager himself is unforgivably classless and cannot comprehend simple mathematics if his life depends on it. I will spare this dealership the little dignity it has left and not mentioned any specific names involved. 

Despite of reading previous bad reviews, I still attempted to give this dealership a benefit of the doubt. Going against my gut instinct, this is one of my biggest mistake. If you value your time and do not want to deal with ""stereotypical"" salesman tactic, please avoid this dealership. 

I hope corporate reads this comment and re-evaluate this dealership's current business practices. I bet this is one of the poor performing branch of Momentum. ",1.0

She gave me a rundown of the services they would perform and the approximate cost.  She also told me it could take up to three hours.  I brought work with me and was able to enjoy a quiet, well-lit environment to do my computer work.  The dealership is very well-appointed.  Service completed in two hours even with two extra items needed to be replaced and the washing of my car.  Very happy and satisfied with Gloria and this dealership.",4.6
77,"March 31, 2016","I currently own my second Volkswagen Beetle and live in Galveston. Clear Lake Volkswagen is of course the closest to my home. However, I recommend everyone do your self a favor and keep driving into Houston. The communication at this dealership is incredibly poor and everyone seems to have a different answer concerning service questions. My personal opinion is that this could be the result of a high turn over rate being as every time I come into the dealership for routine maintenance each service desk has a new nameplate. They unfortunately do not contact you or return calls in a timely fashion. As I said in the title - if you have life commitments (career, children, etc.) continue driving north into Houston where you can be informed correctly (first time) of the processes you may experience and most importantly just receive overall updates concerning your affairs. Throughout my experience owning a Volkswagen, I have received services from Volkswagen located off of 59 and Kirby and they exceeded my expectations. 

I am sitting at the dealership as I write this review and I checked the nameplates on their desk and not a single name in the service department is listed on this sites employee list. This supports my thought of poor communication and high turn over. ",3.2
78,"February 17, 2016",I could have easily gone to another dealer..and I should have. I am disgusted with the leadership at this location and with VW corporate. Went in to get my car serviced... Decided to purchase a new vehicle instead..had been a loyal customer at this location since 2003.. Traded in my vehicle but couldn't retrieve any of my items that night because the service dept was closed..and my car was on a lift. After calling numerous times to verify my items were still there.. How to transfer the title following up etc.. Was told I wouldn't have an issues getting my personal items. I returned a few weeks later.. Everything was stolen from my vehicle.. Including a firearm.. Save a few items. Basically the only thing they could tell me was they have signs up everywhere stating they aren't responsible.

79,"February 10, 2016","we drop the car off on a friday, for check engine light on, the service advisor did not call me back till the following thursday stating that they need to replace two sensors $419.00 and hopping that, it will fix ""my problem"". vehicle was running rough and the check engine light was on, for low fuel pressure.. i okay the repairs. after several days i call them to find out the status of the car and they said the vehicle still has a rough idle, the need 1 more hour check out time. i approve the check out time, after several days i call them back, they could not give any inf. of the vehicle, they gave me the run around. after many calls  the finally had an answer that they need to replace all the injectors that they were shorted internally , est. around $1800.00, and hoping that would fix my problem. W T F and they call them self master certified technicians?. after i made up my mind, i declined the repairs because now i'm dealing with ""mechanics not technicians, drop off car on 12/18/15 pick up 01/26/16. previous approval was 419, plus an hour check out time, when i pick up car my bill was 974 dls? really? the guy name liars said because they did extra things to it, w t f?.  i been driving the car for several days with a slight rough idle, the check engine light came back on for the low fuel pressure again. so my advise to every one to find a reliable mechanic not scammers as the stealer.
been trying to contact the advisor and the receptionist say ""he is on a meeting"" or ""he is with a customer"".

80,"December 31, 2015","Do NOT buy from these guys. They are not ethical salesman. I put a cash downpayment on a car on 10/29 at 641 pm, since it was so late...we did all the paperwork, title, registration, loan, they took my downpayment and told me the car would be cleaned, vacuumed and full of gas by 1100 the next morning. My college age kid was home for the holidays when a lady hit her and totaled her beloved bug that she has had since 2006.  Well this was the most horrible experience of our life!
This was her replacement car to get her back to college. When she arrived to pick the car up at 1100 on 12/30, she was told the car was sold this am to a man. How can you buy a car on 11/29, put a cash downpayment and do all the paperwork with a delivery the next am to find that a man walked in and bought the car after the 1100 deliver time.  This is how car salesmen treat single mothers.  How can you sale a car on 11/30 when is was already sold on 11/29?

I came into this dealership with a very urgent and complicated request. I originally needed to get my co-signer's name off of the title, and be the sole owner of my Jetta. I was very much ignorant to the whole process of re-financing, but Debbie gave me all the information I needed. She was very understanding when I asked if I could think it over and discuss with my family. My co-signer is a commercial fisherman, so his presence was sporadic. There was a lot of rescheduling and all sorts of complications on my part. 

Nonetheless, Debbie was patient and extremely helpful every step of the way. I returned with a completely different request. I ended up trading in my Jetta for a brand new car. There was nothing wrong with the Jetta; I loved it! I just decided to take a different route that was more financially beneficial. Debbie was knowledgeable, personable, and she didn't treat me like a number. She related to me on a personal level. Debbie not only thoroughly educated me, but she also allowed me the freedom and space to consider every option I had in front of me. It also helped that she has a great sense of humor. :)

Keith in Finance made the most confusing part of the car buying experience very clear to me. He also sat through a conference call with my brother, who advises me on financial matters. [Again: Patience and friendliness from Keith] I got a few good laughs from him, too.

Justin walked me through the Connectivity feature of my new car, and his enthusiasm about his job and service to customers added the final touches to my amazing experience!

I drove away with a brand new 2014 Passat, which I absolutely love!! 

My family has been through over ten cars & countless dealerships--Clear Lake Volkswagen has by far the friendliest, most respectful, competent, knowledgeable people.

108,"January 12, 2014","To Whom It May Concern, 

I bought a 2009 Certified Pre-Owned VW Tiguan. I have had several services done to my car and have had to pay for several services for my car. It seems that every time I bring my car in to the Clear Lake VW Service Dept. even for a little service like an oil and filter change that they find at least something wrong with my car that is very expensive. I apparently have excessive carbon build up for the SECOND time in the past year and I have coughed up hundreds of dollars yet again for this service. And yesterday when we picked up my Tiguan from the dealership I had yet again another issue with my car. My navigation system won't turn off when I turn off the car. The last time this happened on the same day that I picked up my Tiguan it ran the battery dead and I had to cough up the money for a new one. So now this is the second this has happened both the same day that I pick up my car from the dealership. It had to have been on for at least 5 hours before we noticed it. 
Not to mention now we have another problem with my car on top of the 10 apparently already that need to be fixed - My power steering light came on. 

I understand the occasional car fixings but almost every couple of months since I have bought this car something expensive needs to be fixed just seems a little odd to me, especially since all of the problems occur at the service dept. or right after picking up my car. 

I am extremely frustrated with this situation and just want a working car. I do feel like the service dept. is to blame and probably causing these problems them selves. 

Please help because at this point I do not know what to do but get hire some one to help me further investigate all of these issues. I would rather pay some one to help me prove how the Clear Lake VW Service Dept is the sole cause of my problems with my car then give Clear Lake any more of my hundreds of dollars.

Of all the dealerships (about nine that I looked at online and contacted by email and phone) Momentum at Clear Lake was the only one that combined competence, intelligence, assertiveness and a willingness to work with me (and accept my own ability to pursue my interests) that really made me feel like I was dealing with people who knew what they were about and what they were doing. Primarily I worked with Justin, and he was far and away the best salesman I talked to during the days I devoted to shopping for a lease.

By comparison a few other VW salesman (at other dealerships in Houston and Austin) came across as churlish, semi-aware roughnecks who brought a hostile, cartel-like attitude to the car shopping experience (they really disliked that I refused to believe that they were the only dealership in the world; since they're pretty much the same machines wherever you go the right attitude for the customer is ""auction,"" not ""cartel""). One even palled our exchange with the prospect of his own starvation if I didn't buy from him!

But Justin and the Clear Lake team provided an almost boutique experience that was courteous, respectful, and... decidedly less creepy than what I was fast becoming used to. What a relief!

If you are shopping for a VW in Houston, please contact Justin and make the drive out to Clear Lake. It is definitely worth it. If you live in the Texas triangle, consider giving them a call if you can afford the time to make the drive. They're an excellent team and I recommend them.",5.0

Was informed that my concerns would be addressed by service with no issues and that service is top notch. My appointment was with Brian Lemmons @ 745AM but he was tied up with another client. I was approached by Eric Langstaff who is one of the Service Writers. To say the least I have never in all my years’ experience in the Aviation and Automotive sectors dealt with a more unprofessional, lazy, terrible attitude individual. ",1.0

Throughout the entire process Justin and finance manager (Janine) worked diligently in order to make our trade-in and prices within our budget.

Throughout the entire process, common courtesies were adhered to.  They were respectful of our time in the buying process, without feeling rushed or forced into the purchase.  They  were willing to take their extra time in order to complete the sale.",5.0

182,"July 30, 2012","Here is a direct quote from CarBuyingTips.com, “Any place charging MSRP doesn't deserve your money.” Houston has a competitive market and there are dealers who want your business and will add value to the purchase of your new car. Momentum VW of Clear Lake will convince you to spend so much money, telling you they have the best deal, they are the largest, blah, blah, blah and if you decide to purchase from them, just know the only thing taken for a ride will be your wallet. Momentum VW of Clear Lake will tell you they are a “no haggle” dealership which to you the buyer ""No Haggle"" to them means ""No Bargain"" to you. Ask them to add value to your purchase and make it more than just buying a car from them, and you will be laughed at - literally. This dealership is merely a VW “Vending Machine” with no value added to your purchase. We ordered a new car from this dealership, prior to any pricing being released by the manufacturer. We were told upon ordering the car that they would work with us on pricing, once the car arrived, just the same as if the car was on their lot. However, once the car was delivered, Momentum VW of Clear Lake told us there was no way they would take less than the MSRP and that they could sell it to the next person that walked in the door – full MSRP. Momentum VW of Clear Lake didn’t want our business; they just wanted to bank their inflated profit.  I loved it when they challenged us to shop around using the old “they are the biggest, best, having more buying power” and that with these cars just now being built, we would not find the one like what we ordered. So it took merely 4 hours shopping around to find a dealership that not only had the exact car we wanted but also valued and wanted our business. Upon returning to Momentum VW of Clear Lake to get our “deposit” back (since we ordered the car) with another dealership’s offer, only then did they decide to want our business.  Momentum VW of Clear Lake goal is to wear customers down, until eventually they give up and give in. Lesson for Clear Lake VW: don’t treat your customers as opponents to be beat. If you do, they’ll eventually think of you that way, too, and eventually move on to someone who’ll work with them instead of against them. During negotiations, they'll pull every trick in the book as part of their negotiations, even trying to use more than one salesperson on you (hence why I have mentioned all three unprofessional associates in this review). They also lie about factory holdback. Momentum VW of Clear Lake
dealers rely on the ignorance of shoppers to scam them. Few people know that holdback is a check equal to 2-3% MSRP, paid to the dealer by the factory once the vehicle has been sold.

183,"May 24, 2012","Bought a certified per owned Vw from them and the vehicle wasn't what it should have been. They offered to take care of everything on my list so I wen't there on my day off. After a 2 hour drive to get there and 5 hour waiting after handing the vehicle over they got nothing done and told me I needed to come back a different day. I talked to the general manager there about what happened...he said to give him a few minutes. After that they offered me a loaner car and a full tank of gas when I bring my vehicle back in a few days later. 
So I dropped of my vehicle the following Tuesday and left it there for a full 7 or 8 days. When I got it back they only fixed 2 things on my list. At this point I was tired of dealing with them so I just took my vehicle left. 
Fast forward 2 weeks; the other day I parked in the parking garage at work when one of my lug bolts fell off. Luckily a co-worker saw it fall off and told me about it.

I asked her at least three times on separate phone calls, if it would be $7300 or less, because I didn't want to waste my time or the time of a salesman and she assured me that it would be.  

  After working outside in freezing temperatures for eight hours, I drove with my wife and three kids in rush hour traffic to your dealership.  I test drove the vehicle and really liked it. Then, we set down with Keith Brown and he proceeded to tell us why we couldn't get it for the price that was quoted to us and wanted to finance it.  I told him that I repeatedly asked if it would be $7300 or less and he blamed it on Margaret, not knowing what she was doing and the vehicle going through service before I got there the next day.

   I left the dealership feeling very angry that I was misled and two hours of my families day had been wasted after I worked all day.  I had the feeling that I was dealing with a shady used car lot instead of a reputable Volkswagen dealership.  I will never buy a new or used car from this dealership. ",1.8
198,"December 13, 2010","All I can say is that I LOVE CLEARLAKE VOLKSWAGON!  When I had my 2007 Volkswagon GLI I had to get the oil change, I was in a time pinch because I was going out of town however, I wanted to make sure I didn't go over the miles for the next oil change.  I explained that I was leaving as well as what time I needed to be on the road and they completley understood.  They rotated my tires and changed my oil before the hour I was planning on being on the road!  I was so grateful and thought they couldn't top the fast service but then they went even further! As I drove off, I just hit the highway when the the warning sign came on that one of my lights where out, I turned around and went right back to the dealership and showed them the problem, they gave me a new light and installed it....FOR FREE!  I was floored and speechless and I thanked them.  After that I knew if I ever wanted to buy a car it would be from only them.  I just went this Saturday to pick out my new 2011 Volkswagon Jetta SEL and Adam was the best!  He made sure this time I got the car in the color I wanted, he even went across town to pick it up while I was in a loaner.  I had a bad experience with Archer VW and will NEVER GO BACK.  I am and will always be a faithful customer to Volkswagon Clear Lake dealership for their great customer service.  ",5.0

200,"August 20, 2010","Service manager quoted me $350 for a transmission flush, when I arrived he said I have a 1.9 liter engine, even though this 
model only came with the 2.0 engine, he then told me the flush would be $500 because I had a different transmission, again this 
model only came with one type of transmission,  He offered a ""discounted flush"" at lower price, which did not include pulling
pan and changing filter, a waste of money.
Was hoping to find a honest dealer with fair prices, I guess that they are few, and far between.",1.8

Maintenance service - brought my own oil, but they still atempted to charge me for the oil.
In the maintenance service they should rotate the tires on the car, but they forgot to do so and took me 2 days to make them do it....
I'll not go back there!",2.5
202,"May 20, 2010","We were so taken for a ride at this place. From the general mgr. on down this place is so rotten you can smell it a mile away. We bought a car cash there but were promised some really expensive but needed repairs. They kept the car just long enough for our postdated check to clear then informed us that no repairs would be forthcoming. Never in my life. 
We stupidly put down all our available cash for the car so we are pretty much stuck with a dud. Stay away from these guys. Karma will take care of them and soon I think.",1.0
203,"February 20, 2010",I bought my 2009 CC from Clear Lake Volkswagen and I love it!!! It's by far the best car I've ever owned. They gave me a great deal and worked with me on financing because most of this was over the phone. When I went to pick it up the car was ready to pick up everything was perfect. Clear lake volkswagen was a great car buying experience.,5.0
204,"February 03, 2010","As always, Alex and the entire team at CLVW took excellent care of my car. Because of them, I actually look forward to service appointments. With their buy 4, get 1 free oil change program I can have the oil changed at the dealer for less than I can do it myself. Matt and Alf in sales are always happy to show me the latest offerings from VW and take me on test drives. If I'm too busy to wait for my car, their quick and courteous shuttle driver gets me to work and back. Alex thoroughly explains the services and any recommendations to keep my car running perfectly. Booking my appointment is easy thanks to the online service scheduler. Alternatively, I can just give Alex a call with the peace of mind knowing that he'll always answer. I bought my first VW at a dealership inside the loop where I live and quickly learned that their service department was inferior. When it came time to buy a new car, I immediately contacted Clear Lake Volkswagen. 12,000 miles later, my 2008 GTI is still running perfectly thanks to their efforts.",5.0
205,"January 03, 2010","AVOID THIS DEALERSHIP! I can't go into how much trouble this dealership has caused me in the past few months. They disassembled our car, the quote was too high, we had the car towed elsewhere. They did not reassemble correctly, left pieces off completely, never returned phone calls, lied to me when they did. My car suffered damage due to the missing pieces. I am currently disputing the charges with my credit card company. They said I lied about the missing pieces. HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE experience. How VW allows a dealership like this to remain open is way beyond me. They have horrible reviews on Better Business Bureau website too. My only hope is that anyone reading this never uses them.",1.4
206,"July 17, 2009","I am a gruff person that speaks very directly (clearly). I told, yes told, the Service Writer that I had had a bad experience with the dealership previously and was apprehensive about getting service there. I wanted to make sure there were no misunderstandings about what service I was to receive. I also stated that I had always gone to one of their competitors, DeMontrond VW, for service and had bought the car from that dealership. Apparently the man didn’t like my directness and stated that I should probably go back to DeMontrond. I closed my hood and got in my car to leave. Then I got out and went in to ask for the Service Mgr to state my case. He sent me to DeMontrond too, because I talked to him wrong as well (no cursing at anytime). They’re a sensitive bunch. I wonder how many other cars DeMontrond sells and services at the advice of their service group. After reading the other reviews on this site, I'm lucky I didn't leave my car there today.",1.0
207,"June 24, 2009","I brought my VW Phaeton fro maintainence at 38000 miles. I paid over $700 and took car home. Next day would not start or even jump start. I have towed to Clear Lake VW. It took 2 months and $6000 to ""fix it"". Now the cruise control is not working and thay declined to repair it. PLEASE PLEASE AVOID THIS DEALER AT ALL COSTS",1.2
208,"April 17, 2009","I originally brought my car into Clear Lake for a steering wheel noise.  They told me it my tires making the noise and that the car needed new tires and alignment.  The noise that I described was when the car was sitting still, nonetheless I changed all four tires and returned to Clear Lake VW for alignment and to have them check the steering noise that I described.  The car was completed that day and returned with no resolution on the noise and the aligmnent was worse than when I brought it in.  Took it back a third time to correct the alignment.  Car was return to me again a day later no change, they told my Wife that the reason it was pulling to the right was the wind and the road.  I took it in a fourth time and had a mechanic ride with me and finally confirm that there was a noise, and the alignment was still off.  Got the car back after four days and the alignment is still off.  The noise issue is fixed after 5 times, so I guess they will not get the alignment correct until the fifth time as well.  Avoid this dealership at all cost, drive across town for service, service staff can be rude at times.  I will not ever use this dealership again",1.4
209,"October 23, 2008","He was rude, he was not particularly helpful and  he had no idea what was going on.  When I expressed my problem with my car he basically said that if they couldn't recreate the exact thing that I was wrong and my car was fine.  Needless to say last time I had brought it to them with the exact same problem they ""fixed it"" and less than 6 months later the same thing is happening.  
I had spoken to him the day before about a loaner/rental and he let me know that I would have to pay for it myself b/c it wasn't their fault my car wasn't working, even though it was their crappy work to begin with.  
PLUS at the end of the day, they didn't fix it again.  
I will never buy another VW, nor will I ever deal with Clear Lake VW again.",1.0
210,"March 16, 2007","My 2005 Jetta TDI simply stopped running while entering a freeway.
It would not start.
I used VW's roadside assistance to get a tow to the nearest dealer, in this case Clear Lake Volkswagen and arrived just before closing time.
They took the vehicle to check it out the next day.
They diagnosed the problem as ""bad fuel"", and that ""we see this all the time"".
A call that evening said that the car was ready to be picked up.
We arrived (25 mile trip) and the cashier had the ticket and we paid close to $700.
But the car was not ready yet.
The back seat was still removed, the cover off the fuel tank and a hose dangling from it.
It took about another hour for them to get it put back together and send someone out to get fresh diesel for it.
Dee Dee had already gone home for the evening.

The charge for the repair was five hours of labor, the maximum in the book for this task.  A friend who services TDIs said that there is really no reason for it to take five hours.  He also says that he NEVER sees fuel quality problems.

This past week, same problem.
Bad fuel?

This time I had AAA tow it to my friend's dealership.
No fault codes in the computer and replacing the o-rings on the fuel filter (the quick fix) didn't work.  He later tested the fuel pumps and found that the pump in the tank no longer worked.  After replacing it (ironically, with a pump that came from Clear Lake VW's supply) it worked fine, with the same tank of fuel.

My belief is that the fault the first time was an intermittent problem with the fuel pump, not bad fuel.  Clear Lake's did not test the fuel pump - they told me that they put a container of ""good"" fuel over the engine and gravity-fed it into the engine and it ran.  They simply assumed that this was a fuel quality problem and not a fuel starvation problem.

The combination of misdiagnosis, overcharging and false reporting of task completion leads me to NOT recommend this dealership for service.",2.0
