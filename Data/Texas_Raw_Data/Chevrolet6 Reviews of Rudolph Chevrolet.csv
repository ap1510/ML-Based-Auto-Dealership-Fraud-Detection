1,"September 27, 2015","If you don't throw open your billfold for anything the service reps want to do to your truck, they get mad and won't return your calls. They are always ""out to lunch"" when they want to avoid you. Not everyone has endless funds. As a retired,disabled veteran I, as well as many others, live on a limited income.  Service manager ""Steve"" sides with his reps and won't listen to you. After buying several factory ordered Silverados from them, I WON'T be going back. My 05 and 07 Silverados STILL have ""clanking"" sounds from the power train and they still haven't been able to fix them or tell me why they do that. They replace a heating coil in my 05 and insinuated that I must have let water out of the system after I returned  it for overheating. They couldn't comprehend that maybe THEIR personnel didn't put enough water in it. I took it in for an AC problem and was given the ""run around."" I asked to speak to the owner, and after several calls, was called by the manager (Mike Miles.) He asked if I was coming back to Rudolph, and I said no.  He said any further conversation was pointless. How rude and flip... I guess the owner of the dealership lets the ""inmates run the prison."" It's a shame as the parts dept runs perfectly. Maybe the service dept should be trained by the parts dept...",1.0
2,"November 18, 2013","I took my son's Chevrolet Cobalt to Rudolph Chevrolet on Friday, November 15, 2013.  I took it in because the key was suck in the ingnition and I felt an unusual vibration in the engine when starting.  I the service advisor to have the mechanics to inspect the motor mounts and to repair the stuck key in the ignition.  On Saturday, November 16, 2013, I picked my son's car up.  There was a large dent in the drivers side front fender that was not there when I dropped the vehicle off the day before.  I spoke with the service advisor after I noticed the damage to the car. He told me that the damage was there when I dropped the car off the day before. He even provided the inspection sheet that he filled out when I dropped the car off. The only problem with this is that I know it is standard procedure that the service advisor walk around the vehicle and point out any damage to the customer when the vehicle is dropped off. That did not happen. The service advisor then took to speak with his manager and he pretty much told me that it was written of the inpection and there was nothing they were willing to do to help resolve my issues wtih the damage.  The vehicle did not have any body damage when I dropped it off on Friday, Novermber 15, 2013.  Not only that, when I got the vehicle home the key was still stuck in the ignition.  I paid quite a bit of money to have my car repaired and it appears that they are just changing parts by process of elimination and are going to charge me for additional work to get the problem fixed.",2.2
3,"December 01, 2011",Rick Armijo happens to be a Corvette Specialist but he sure knows his way around every other car on their lot.  He treated us with respect and took lots of time to answer our many questions.  We browsed new and used cars and ended up with a used vehicle in order to save some money.  Rick never once pressured us into buying something we weren't happy with buying just to sell a car at a higher cost.  He new our situation and even helped us get a lower price on my car than was already listed.  We had a great experience with everyone there and were so happy with our purchase.  We've also been in touch a few times afterward so that they could make sure everything was running correctly.  This is how you get repeat business and good word of mouth!,5.0
4,"November 19, 2010","Jerry Chavez was an excellent salesman!  He was very freindly, he allowed my wife and I to test drive multiple vehicles, he was extemely knowledgable about the product, and always did what he said he was going to do.  I would recommend to all my friends and family to go see Jerry at Rudolph Chevrolet for first class service and attention.  Don Finley made the whole financing process a cinch.  He treated us with the friendly and warm professionalism that capped off a great experience.  Mr. Miles was great in seeing that all of the above (the price, attention, financing, etc.) came together.",5.0
5,"July 31, 2010","Well, I went to Rudolph to try and purchase a truck but nobody came outside to help me.  My family and I were just left out by ourselves.  So I went to Viva and got my truck from them.  Maybe if they have more salespeople or something that might help.",2.0
