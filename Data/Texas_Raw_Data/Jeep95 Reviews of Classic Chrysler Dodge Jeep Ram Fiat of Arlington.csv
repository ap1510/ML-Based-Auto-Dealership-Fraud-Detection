0,"June 01, 2020","This dealer had a great price on a new car that I was wanting. I emailed my interest to them, filled out the vehicle appraisal form, and filled out the credit application. After a few hours of not hearing back from them I called and was told me information ""would be relayed"" to someone in sales. Friday afternoon went by with no return phone call and then all day Saturday. Sunday rolls around and the car shows as sold. Never in my life have a worked with a dealership so uninterested in selling a car. ",1.8
1,"March 30, 2020","DO NOT take your vehicle to this place. I dropped my vehicle off to get a new PCM and a week later when it was ready and I went and picked it up, not only was the service guy , Chris ,the rudest and most disrespectful smartass possible , but now my radio don't work, they tried to tell me that they had no reason to touch the radio , but it was working when I dropped the truck off at their shop, now the radio will not come on at all and it's been pushed back in the dash and a screw has been taken out that holds the dash in , but they try to tell me they didn't touch it. The service guy , Chris ,was the most disrespectful smart mouth little punk that I have ever dealt with, the worst business choice for dealing with customers. If I could give it a negative three stars I would. This was buy for my worst experience with a business and a mechanic, I have already called the corporate headquarters and am also contacting the BBB and file a complaint tomorrow. ",1.0
2,"March 25, 2020",Junior was my service rep. After 3 hours of waiting. He comes in and tells no part can be ordered for my truck. Also there is no recall on the part. My option would to trade truck in.It might go 60 miles before it dies again. I drove it over a 100 miles and the light has not come back on.,1.0
3,"February 23, 2020","Thinking of doing business with Classic CDJR Fiat of Arlington?  On February 22nd, 2020 Classic CDJR Fiat of Arlington had a Better Business Bureau rating of “F”.
Classic CDJR Fiat of Arlington is located on the I-20 west bound service road and Collins.   The dealership changed from Ewing to Classic CDJR Fiat of Arlington around November 2017.  I currently have a dispute with Classic CDJR Fiat of Arlington and just added a new complaint with the BBB.   I purchased a 2018 Pacifica Hybrid back in December 2017 from Classic.  I have had pretty good service with them until November 2019.   I had the Pacifica in the shop for some warranty work on the surround/backup camera system.   The Pacifica came out of the shop on November 27th with some small dents around the plugin charging port and also had some tire/rim damage.   I brought the plugin charging port damage to the attention of the service advisor and he took some pictures of the charging port dents.   Laura Lee Pirtle is the dealership owner’s wife and she fills the role of the Director of Customer Service.   She sends out follow-up letters to customers to make sure everything went well with maintenance visits and auto purchases.   So I wrote Laura Lee on November 30th and explained what happened to my Pacifica.   She wrote back that Carmine Bianco is the Service Director and he makes the maintenance decisions.   So I write Carmine Bianco.   He doesn’t respond.   Okay, so back to Laura Lee.   On December 18th I share with Laura Lee that Carmine is not communicating with me.   I soon get an email from Paul Sears, Service Manager, he wants me to bring the Pacifica back in.   So I go in the next day, although I did not meet Paul, Classic took some more pictures of the damage.   After several unanswered emails to Service Manager Paul Sears I email Laura Lee on Jan 2nd , Paul Sears is not responding to my email.    On Jan 15th Laura Lee writes me back.   Laura Lee tells me Service Director Carmine Bianco forwarded a few emails Service Manager Paul Sears had sent to me as recently as Jan 13th and they say they haven’t heard from me.   I asked Laura Lee if she could forward Paul Sears recent emails to me.   Laura Lee never forwarded any emails that Carmine claimed Paul had sent me.   On Jan 21st I wrote Laura Lee back and pointed out she had not forwarded the emails Carmine claimed Paul had sent me I also pointed out the dealership has my home address, my cell and home phone numbers and my email address and yet the dealership cannot contact me?   So I am in the process of getting estimates to repair the damage and have shared with Classic CDJR Fiat of Arlington that I expect them to pay for the repairs.   We are a long way from resolving this issue.   I would not recommend doing business with Classic CDJR Fiat of Arlington until the dealership can build a track record of good customer service.   When I bought my 2018 Pacifica Hybrid I might have given the dealership a five star rating, today the dealership has earned a less than one star rating.

One thing I would like to leave with everyone is that no matter how good your relationship is with your vehicle maintenance provider, when you pull in to the shop walk around your vehicle and take pictures of your vehicle and when the maintenance is over do another walk around and take pictures again.

4,"December 23, 2019",I’m sitting here missing my family over the holidays because this dealership couldn’t be bothered to tell me they would be closed Monday through Wednesday this week. They have had my car for a week. That’s not the issue. I told them on Friday if my car wouldn’t be ready on Monday let me know so I could make arrangements for the holidays. I heard nothing today so I called and was informed they are closed. Thanks for ruining my vacation and holiday. Thanks for treating me like yesterday’s newspaper. Can’t believe I chose you over the dealership in Weatherford which is right out my back door.  Guess whose in my permanent naughty list. ,1.0

So I wait patiently 3 pm comes around and I haven""t seen my service rep at all.So I go look for him and called got answering service. I find him and ask about status of my vehicle, he said he didn't know. the guy never brought the battery and it'll be there in another hour. I didn't leave the place till 4:30.. Crazy 7hrs wait for a new battery and an oil change. On top of a hefty bill..

6,"August 20, 2019","I was attempting to buy a Ram 2500 truck at the Classic Arlington site.  I requested info from the website.  I received an email from yhaley@classiccdjrf.com that provided a link to the Classic web site.  On Monday I received a call from two different gentlemen (Brad Fuller & Matt).  I made an appointment to see Chad Vanoven on Tuesday evening 8/13/19 at 6:30 to view a specific 2018 Ram 2500 diesel crew Lariat (vin 3C6UR5FL3JG237074).  I was told that Classic valued the customer's time and wanted to ensure that the vehicle would be prepped and ready for viewing.  I was provided a meeting ID code of R 6812.  On Tuesday morning I received a call to confirm the meeting.  During that conversation, I requested to be informed of any changes, such as the specific truck being sold, prior to me driving to Arlington.  I drove 1.5 hrs. in heavy traffic from Greenville, TX to meet with Mr. Vanoven.  When I arrived I found out that Mr. Vanoven was not there and that I should talk to anyone of the sales staff.  (seemed disrespectful to have a specific appointment that was not honored).  Even worse, I was told that the truck I had driven to Arlington to see was not available because one of the employees had been driving it for the last several days to see if he wanted to buy it.  At this point I'm sure you can understand my disappointment with the dealership.  I am wondering if this is a bait and switch tactic or just a total lack of appreciation for a potential customer.   I posted my issue on Classic's ""problem resolution"" page and expressed my concern with two individuals that called to follow-up on the appointment.  I have not been contacted by any member of management from the dealership to explain their failure.  I am left to assume that this must be an acceptable and common practice with Classic Dodge Jeep Ram Fiat of Arlington.

8,"June 17, 2019","Appreciated interactions with Dan at that time Service Manager.

Jimmy Carey is exceptional And very knowledgeable Service  Advisor as it relates to my 500 POP.

My concerns weren’t addressed as well from the Owners, thus I have little to no confidence I recommending purchasing a vehicle from this dealership.  Bought vehicle in March 2017; Tim was a dishonest, dishonorable former Parts Manager, so glad he’s no longer there. I’m very suspect of a vehicle that’s has rotor issues within the first 30days and the dealership does NOTHING to amicably resolve the issue.

The OIL CHANGES prices without coupons were extremely pricey and it would take an act of Congress just to get the $59.95 + tax/fees consistently.",3.0

11,"May 03, 2019","I will not ever be returning to this service center. Pacifica was in shop last week for 2 warranty issues and scheduled oil change while we were there. Carmine tried to sell me 4 new tires within minutes of me walking in and acted like it was necessary due to tires being different. Point blank told me 4 were needed. Long story short, didnt have tire or price we wanted so told them no. Went to pick up car expecting to look at tires and see Carmine was right only to find out tires were the same brand, size, and rating, only difference was one was newer model (not ""lemons"" or 3 different tires like he stated). And the main warranty issue we were there to address still wasn't fixed. Chris the service agent never came to explain to us or called to explain the tire issue or be transparent. If once they got the tires off in the back had called and explained their findings and gave us the option of 2 or 4 tires with all the facts, we probably would have bought tires. 

 Left a review the next day and suddenly the owner and Dan in the service center are very concerned and want to look at my car to figure out where the problem/misunderstanding was. Pretty much got the feeling Dan wanted to prove me wrong. Suddenly wanted to look at tread, turn wheels, even took pictures of model and brand and basically, I think, to be able say my initial review was a lie. By that point I had already removed review and was willing to give him a chance to rectify the situation and hear him out. But Dan's answer pretty much was it was sound advice by Carmine, just not well explained. Yet Dan also admitted he couldn't think of a scenario where having 2 different model tires on a FWD vehicle in the front that are both A/S in Texas this time of year could cause an issue if they were wearing the same and had good tread left.
I had already gone to a different company before going in to talk to Dan and asked point blank twice if I needed 4 new tires or only 2 (2 did have lower tread and needed replacing soon but all 4 were wearing evenly and 2 in front had 9/11 tread rating still.) Even when the other placed priced 2 and explained the 2 good ones I still had didnt have a milage warranty on them and I again asked if I should replace 4, assistant manager of other company again said ""no reason to replace good tires, just the 2 with lower tread and more wear need to be replaced."" 

Never once did Dan come out and admit Carmine's mistake just basically danced around the facts and spent 30 minutes of my day trying to trip me up or prove me wrong. Did nothing to earn my trust back. While I appreciated him listening to my side of things and taking the time, if you cant admit your guy messed up, I wont be returning and you aren't to be trusted in my opinion. I will be finding another dealership to deal with the warranty issue. ",1.0

Ever single dealerships talk to you like you stupid and play these dumb games. This dealership said they wasn't going to play them games they was going to give me a good deal. La'porsha came out and she was friendly knowledgeable and willing to make this my last dealership. She gave me a trade in price that was so good I didn't have to negotiate, it was more than what I wanted. The car I bought had low miles and was the cheapest within 50 miles. If you want to get a new or used car and you tired of the games, you tired of the salesman's thinking they'll Einstein and you some brainless person. Well go to this dealership if you want to trade in your car they going to give you a good prices, if you want to buy a pre-own car they going to have good prices.

Thanks for your feedback, please reach out to Marc Kraus at _________ to discuss your complaint, thank you. 


This was just left to me and he is the Sales manager. He has no idea why I would be calling him. Another wasted phone call. He was very nice but it in no way helped me out. 

Prior to that message, I got an email from Laura Lee Pirtle,
Director of Customer Relations. She asked me how my experience was and if i had any problems. I sent her an email back with all my concerns.
The following day- someone from service department called me and was not friendly to me AT ALL. She had called him about the email and someone didn't understand what I had said. It was a miscommunication but that is all he cared about. Not addressing any other problems that happened.

44,"August 01, 2018","I cant speak to the sales side but the service side was a horrible experience.  They either a) were intentionally dishonest about what was wrong or b) were dishonest about the expertise of their technicians - as well as dishonest on a variety of other levels throughout my experience.

First, they claim you can make appointments online. I made an appointment two weeks in advance and was called back a couple days before the scheduled date and told the appointment had to be rescheduled because of the type of service I requested. This stipulation is not clear on their website.

Next, they implicitly claim to honor appointments. However, this is not the case. I arrived early for my appointment and was told it would be ""about an hour"" to diagnose the car. After two and a half hours, I called them and was told I would recieve a return call in 15 minutes. No one called me back and when I called again, yet another hour later, I was told again that someone would call me back in 15 minutes. No one called back; the second call was an opportunity for them to be honest about workload if they couldn't honor my appointment but this never happened. While some deviation in time is to be expected (and is even noted on their website), this was a huge and unacceptable gap.

After about 4 hours, I just returned to the shop to get the car and was told the diagnostic was in fact, suddenly complete. They quoted $950 for a repair another shop fixed for $100. The other shop said it was a common problem and they recognized it right away. They fixed it in under an hour.

On a general customer service note, no one seemed to know how to handle my complaints and service guys were hanging out in the lobby.",1.0
45,"July 20, 2018",I took my car in for a recall and decided to get an oil change and tire rotation. Little did I know it was under new ownership. When I first bought my car from the previous ownership I was given free oil changes for the life of the car. Well that was a lie. When the next dealership bought them out they didnt honor the life time oil changes and said they would give me 5 free. I should have had 4 left. Then Classic bought the Dealership and wouldn't honor any free oil changes. This location from the day I bought my car has been nothing but disappointments. So when will it change owners next. My advise is go to a different Dealership it is well worth the few extra miles. I will never go to Classic for anything. I will just go to another Dealership for all my car needs. The service manager basically called me a Liar when I had gotten a free oil change from the other Dealership  He said the other Dealership doesnt give free oil changes because he knows people over there. Then he changed his mind and said well the do have there own free oil change packages.,2.2

50,"October 16, 2017","Aside from the smoke smell I do feel like I got a good deal on the vehicle,  they beat Navy Feds finance rate and truck is in good working order.  Typically I wouldn't knock a dealer for trying to cover up or ""clean up"" the smoke smell in a car.  The only complaint I have is I specifically asked the manager if the truck was smoked in and the office manager told me ""no,  I only have 1 truck that was smoked in and pointed in the lot somewhere at another truck"".  They did a good job of covering it up and about 4-5 days later the smell started to become apparent.  After looking closer I could see where they tried to shampoo the head liner ect. to cover it up. LaPorsche was really nice and professional and treated me well. I think the loss is more for her as the dealership will not be affected by me not returning but my wife and I do typically buy new cars every 6 months to a year, so really the injustice is to LaPorsche.  So $350 out of pocket later hiring a specialist the truck is smoke free, all and all I was happy with my visit but due to being lied to I would not do business at this dealer again. ",2.6

Ryan was very friendly and helpful. Showed me all of the night editions on the lot and took one for a drive. When we went inside and I decided on the color that interested me, Mark went ahead and went to the service center where my 2016 was in line for service and got all the info needed for appraisal. I worked with Ryan, Dhruv, and Mark crunching numnbers to make sure they fit my budget. I was not planning on buying, just came in for an oil change. When they were able to meet my expectations on price, payment, trade in value, and extra added features in the truck i wanted, it was a no brainer. Ryan has demonstrated excellent communication and customer service. He has been in  constant communication with me every day since I left the lot. He coordinated everything with service to make sure everything was in stock that will be added to my new truck. When I dropped it off this morning, Aaron from service greeted me and when I told him my name, he immediately knew what I was there for and was prepared to help. He said he was working with Ryan the day before and is up to speed, all parts to be installed are waiting in his office. Ryan also coordinated a loaner for me, so that was also ready. Great experience overall with Sales and Service teams! I will be recommending Ewing to friends and family - I will send them to Ryan and team!",5.0
61,"May 21, 2017","We bought a Jeep from Joe Delmar at Ewing Jeep in Arlington, this  was a smooth and easy purchase.  We were hesitant to go there because of previous reviews but were pleasantly surprised to find out that they were under new management  and employees were happy to be there now.  Joe was respectful, honest, personable and educated on the vehicles. If you are in the market give Joe a chance, you will not regret it.",5.0

So happy with my new jeep! ",5.0
65,"May 02, 2017","My fiance and I were in a bad situation with a previous vehicle that we no longer wanted just after 5 short days.  This vehicle was purchased at another dealership and the other dealership would not allow us to return.  We knew that we would now be UPSIDE DOWN.  We went to Ewing searching for a dodge pickup and Joe Delmar was assisting us.  I have never met an amazing salesman such as Joe.  He was straight forward, not pushy and seeing us as a dollar sign.  He was personal and eager to help our upside down situation and make sure that we were saving as much as possible with rebates.  We could've not had a better experience with Ewing.  Make sure you schedule an appointment with Joe to make sure he is your salesman.",5.0
66,"April 27, 2017","We recently got a Cadillac ATS from Juana here, and we were really very pleased with the service we receive from Juana and the management there. We REALLY did our research and shopped around, and we felt that we got a very fair price for a beautiful car in wonderful condition. Not only that, but we were having an absolutely horrible day between working, commuting and trying to return a rental car to a nonexistent Hertz location, and it was chaotic. Finally we were in a bind and Juana returned the rental car for us, and it really saved the day. I can't believe how much she went above and beyond. We love the car, we felt like we were treated like royalty during a very stressful time, and we felt like we got an excellent car at a fair price. But most of all, Juana REALLY went above and beyond! We have already recommended this dealer to several of our friends. Thank you!",5.0

69,"March 21, 2017","I'm only giving one star because I can't give a negative. 
I purchased a 2015 Ram 2500 6.7 Cummins. Purchased march 3rd 2017 at classic Chevrolet. On 3/13/17 I brought it in for some warranty work. After it took a week to even get back to me on what was gonna be done, the tech was not responsible enough to verify that the Vehicle hoist was capable of lifting the truck he decided to lift it anyways. Well he ended dropping the truck off the rack... 9,000 lb truck falling 8 feet to the ground. The damage includes front bumper, side steps bent to the cab, dpf filter and cats, tailgate, passenger bed corner and most importantly bent the driveshaft. The reason of concern for this. Is there could be hairline fractures that won't expose themselves until I'm driving down the roam at 70mph, they wanted to put a insurance claim against my truck. I wasn't ok with this for two reasons, 1... the drive shaft issues and the long term affect. 2.... I paid for a clean 1 owner low mile truck..... now I loose my xxx on it! After arguing with them for 2 days they agreed to pay the truck off in full $37,361.36 (I only had the truck two weeks) told them I have no problem going into business with them to find another truck and use my truck as the tax benifit towards a new truck and no down payment.  After their lack of commitment to customer satisfaction their search for a truck diminished. They only looked when I took work off (loosing money) to come down for 3-4 hours until he looked I did this several times. My lost earnings through work and fees I had to pay for, for me not having my truck accumulates appx $4,000. Now as I sit here at the dealership they refuse to find a truck that works. They are insistent on finding a $32-$34,000 truck so they can make some money on it! It's not their time to make money on a truck it's their time to make it right! I have found several trucks at local dealers they can buy and sell to me... they refuse to cooperate. I have been extremely patient and respectful through out this whole process! I haven't been greedy on asking for a better truck or more expensive truck...just want them to do right! I have wasted so much time and money on getting this corrected! For those that don't know Ewing still employes about 75% of the holy staff! It's no wonder that they have the lowest rating in the metroplex!!! I write this as I sit at the dealership... for the last time 3/21/17  before I take legal matters... I'll leave this up until they get this corrected!!!!",1.8
70,"March 21, 2017",Very friendly sales group. Very professional. I went in looking for a new pickup and drove one out a couple hours later at a great price. I will definitely recommend to my friends and others to shop here first. I know I will be back.,5.0
71,"March 15, 2017","The salesperson, finance department and others in the dealership were all very nice.  Only negative was the car detailing, it did not meet the standards that Don Davis has for their used vehicles. I went to the service department today to get a quote for adding Navigation to the vehicle and It was like I was asking the service writer to do the work himself. 

Front end of the dealership is great.  Need work in Service. ",4.4

Thanks JJ!!!!!!!.....,5.0

80,"February 28, 2017",Jeff McDonald was very knowledgeable and answered my questions directly. He was available to me by phone and when I went to the dealership he was prompt in keeping his appointments. When I needed him he was there and if I needed space he allowed me that space. Overall it was a very enjoyable experience.,5.0
81,"February 28, 2017","After promises and promises that things would improve under new ownership I continue to experience the same experience over and over. I wait 30+ minutes to be acknowledged by anyone in the service Dept, 4 hour oil changes constantly after being promissed hour or less. This last time on a recall repair which had been explained by 3 different service advisors as a 4 hour job turned in to a 10 hour experience where the service advisor told me if I was unhappy to just start going to another dealer. I think I will take his advice as nothing seems to be getting better, it is a shame because I have had a 5 year relationship with the dealership across 3 different vehicles now",1.4

83,"February 27, 2017","I learned there is a reason Ewing has been around so long, the people you hire. You should be proud to have Chad representing your company. He is honest. I left a $1100.00 watch in the car and when I went back for my garage door opener he handed me my watch. I forgot it was in the car. That says a lot about him as a person. In forty years of buying cars he is at the top of the list. My daughter is buying a jeep next month she is buying from him.
Also your finance department. What do you say about Daryl.......I could see a day watching the cowboys and having a beer with him. Prepared, organized and professional. Chad and Daryl are a great team and an asset to Ewing.
My only complaint is you wanted $800.00 to activate my navigation system and Huffines is charging $695.00. And I didn't buy the car from them. That's on you.
With that said I will be referring friends and family to go see Chad and Daryl.

86,"February 24, 2017","I owned a 2014 Dodge Durango. I had been to other dealerships who wouldn't accept it as a trade in due to me being $12k upside, mostly high mileage. I went into the dealership at 7pm not knowing they closed at 8pm. Mr. Jim helped me after I told him my situation. He gave me options, but I had to return the next day. Before I left the car lot, I picked out the Jeep I wanted. The next day, Mr. Jim told me my car was ready. Unfortunately they were backed up in finance so I had to wait a little longer than expected, but they took my trade and now I am driving a brand new 2017 Jeep Latitude. Mr. Jim took his time to explain features and has kept in contact the whole week following up.",5.0

88,"February 22, 2017","The reason you get a five, there is nothing like feeling important. I was treated with respected, details I was looking for in a car I were met. I went to two other major dealerships, which I will not name. One did not offer me a good deal but held me and my keys hostage I felt for 3 hrs longer than what I cared to be there for. After I asked to have some time to think about the deal I could not get my keys to leave. That to me was awful, The other dealership, did not ask me for what I was looking for in a car. They ran my credit, came straight out and said you need a co signer, I said no, I don't, I make more than enough money and can make a down payment to secure my loan. They said well we can not help us and basically talked down to me and showed me the door. I went to Ewing, I was greeting by salesman, told him what I was interested in, what my problems were concerning safety in my current vehicle, He listened, showed me a vehicle he thought I would love. He was right. The deal was not immediate. He was honest. told me what I needed. From there I took it into my own hands went a little further called him back with what I decided to do. He took that and ran with it. In a matter of 2 hours. I was driving home in my New Cherokee Sport. My whole experience was a 10 including the time I spent with the finance department.

94,"January 30, 2017","Beware  of this dealership! I just bought a new jeep from a leasing company and unfortunately my windshield wiper was broken. I took it up there to get it replaced. when i pulled up into the bay a man came to me i told him what i was there for he said let me find someone to help you?? why couldnt he help me? so another guy comes over i explain again  what happen and then he goes well how do you know its broken.... well its popping and you can see it..? he then says yes it is in fact broken and they explains how they arent that expensive. I said now wait this car is a week old and im not paying for new wipers. He said well let me see if its covered under warranty and infact it was.  I got out signed my stuff and went into the waiting area. He pulled my car out of the bay , next to the wood fence and parked it. I then noticed someone drove it off to somewhere. 15 mins or so pass and then they finally come get me my  car was ready and it was parked around front. When I got there my husbands $219 motorcycle helmet, face shield, and gloves were in the back seat DRIVER side floor board.  I didnt pay no attention to it not being there as i mean who would steal it out of my car at a dealership??? I went home after that. My car stays locked! later on i went to the store before i did i went to throw out the trash in my back seat and saw his helmet was not in there. I thought he took it out. But infact DID NOT! I called the dealership and spoke to Dustin in the service department who was pretty dumb. he said he asked his staff if they stole it... like who is going to admit to stealing from a customers vehicle.??? He said he was look around and get back to me. NEVER DID!!! next day i went up there and spoke to a Johnny who seems pretty nice. Said GM wasnt there and would talk to him and Dustin. Never HEARD BACK! i called again and was told by Johnny i would get a call back from him in 10 mins... NEVER DID! Obviously they were giving me an run around and didnt care one bit about this! Today 1/30 I went up there again I spoke to johnny who took me to Dustin which is extremely rude. He  said that they dont have a theft problem and no tech was in my car. Someone was in my car as yall drove it around the building and had it out of my sight for 15 mins. I asked if there were cameras he said no. Well thats stupid dont yall have expensive tools in there??? I said so you dont know that your staff didnt take it. He then says we dont know if it was in there..... LIKE WOW! He didnt seem to care and I advised him i would post this everywhere! He didnt care about that either. This dealership is horrible they care if there staff steals from your car! I know im partially to blame as i should have known better to have left it in the back but i didnt know someone would be going through my stuff. BE WARE and check your car before you leave. Im now out of a brand new week old Bilt Helmet, face shield and gloves that wasnt cheap. OH and not to mention it was my Husbands Anniversary present and Get out of the Military gift for his hard work.... So thanks Dustin for not caring nor fixing the issue.",1.0
