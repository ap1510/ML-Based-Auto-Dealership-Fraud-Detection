2,"October 30, 2018","My husband and I drove 1 hour to meet up with a salesman in hopes of trading in and purchasing a vehicle from the used sales department. The salesman who we had was new and a bit clueless to majority of the questions we had. We had to search around for ourselves to find answers or search them online. Ultimately we decided we did want to trade in my vehicle and attempt to purchase the used vehicle. After going back and forth with the trade in numbers we decided to make the switch. We purchased on 9/15 and a little over a month later on 10/24 my truck was showing minimum oil, yet the MMI screen was showing that I was 8100 miles away from needing an oil change. After reaching out to my salesman on 10/24 I was  told that if I felt that it needed oil to just buy some and put it in ourselves. There was no way that I was going to drive 2 hours back and forth especially after I messaged my salesman pictures of what I was seeing. I asked if a record was kept that I would like to see that an oil change was completed. The salesman assured me that it had been completed as it is to all vehicles that are sold. He eventually sent a copy of my vehicle record showing an oil change was completed on 9/8. Today 10/30 my truck says to add oil,  since I was falling below minimum. I contacted the dealership and was transferred so many times that my salesman ended up calling me back. I explained to him what my truck was showing and what it was saying and he insisted that my vehicle had been serviced and that VW Woodlands would never reset the oil meter and not complete a job. After hanging up I decided to take me truck to a local service shop and to my surprise the oil that came out was old and black. No oil change was ever completed and someone in the service department was paid labor charges of $200 to reset the meter and not complete the job. Never again will I ever purchase a new or used vehicle from this location, nor will I refer anyone to them.  If this was done to my vehicle, how many others vehicles have gone unserviced just to rack up labor fees? ",2.0

4,"September 04, 2018","Went to dealership to purchase a new car.  Found a car and negotiated a fair price.  Then when the time came to sign the paperwork the salesman tried to sneak in ETCHING ($299 rip-off), DEALER INVENTORY TAX ($50 rip-off), and DOCUMENT FEE ($150 rip-off).  In total $500 in bogus charges to the customer.  BUYER BEWARE!  The salesman and sales manager are crooks out for your money!  ",1.0
5,"August 18, 2018","My wife and I were prepared to buy a new car today.  My wife decided she wanted a VW, so we went to VW of the Woodlands.  We walked around looking at different colors of the model she had already decided she wanted for about 25 minutes.  No one ever approached us while we were looking, no big deal, maybe they have a ""no pressure"" policy.  So we went inside to talk to a salesman.  Waited over 30 minutes after the receptionist called for a salesman.  2 salesmen approached the customer standing near us to have his license plates installed, but no one ever said a word to us.  Couldn't ask the receptionist to call again because she was showing the caterer where to put the food.  VW of the Woodlands lost a sale today.  Very disappointed. ",1.0

17,"October 19, 2017",Avoid this Dealership if possible.  Bought a used car for my daughter here and noticed the windshield had a chip before finalizing the paperwork.  Added into the contract was the agreement that the windshield would be corrected by the dealership.  Their repair contractor was busy so they told us to have it repaired and they would pay the invoice.  Our repair shop said the chip was not able to be repaired and he could not warranty a repair if he tried.  Contacted the dealership and the boss of the salesman who basically said they were not honoring the agreement.  He said they would look at it and if the vehicle was legal to drive it was not their problem.  I noted that no one had done anything to repair the window as agreed and when I asked to just return the vehicle and void the transaction we were told that we could trade it in.  Not sure how these people sleep at night.,1.0

19,"September 27, 2017","Took Passat in because of check engine light. Car still under full warranty. Car was left overnight, went to pick it up today and they said “GREAT NEWS!” “There’s nothing wrong with your car. The oil cap just needed to be tightened, it was allowing pressure issues and caused check engine light to come on.”

I said “GREAT”! 

I was then given a bill for $125 for diagnostics. I confirmed that there was no work done on the car, other then them turning the oil cap securely. They replied “YES”. 

I was charge $125 to have someone lift the hood and turn the oil cap, because that isn’t covered under warranty. Wouldn’t that be covered under “BASIC CUSTOMER SERVICE”? ",1.0

23,"June 26, 2017",My experience was great. Car was in great shape and price was fair and required little to no negotiation to get to an agreeable price. Further their financing department was able to find me a great rate on my loan. Jeanna Goldberg was easy to work with and honest about the car. She was also more than happy to deliver the car to my house since it wasn't convenient for me to pick it up. Car required a minor fix to the door that was taken care of free of charge after the sale with no problem. I highly recommend this dealership and Jeanna Goldberg as a sales person. Thanks!,5.0

26,"March 26, 2017","I've been looking for a vehicle for 2 months and have been dealing with horrible dealerships. I've been nothing but lied to and harassed since I began my search. And the salesman all have been nothing but liars and crooked just looking to seal a deal. Looking for a vehicle was honestly one of the most frustrating experiences I can recall. 

That is until I found Volkswagen Of The Woodlands. Laurel and Ms Teresa were very professional and from my perspective gave perfect customer service. They were upfront from the beginning about everything. They did not harass me, and gave me space and time to come to a decision by myself. It took me a week to actually decide to make the deal and they never pressured me at all. Laurel and Teresa deffinaty will get my recommendation for anyone I know searching for a vehicle. And if I ever am looking for another I will be going to them 1st. ",5.0

I am the type to be suspicious of sales people of any kind, but Laurel Williams and Chuck Bell were very friendly, helpful, and honest!

28,"February 28, 2017","Service Experience Only- 

I brought my car in about 3 weeks ago because the check engine light was illuminated.  Great news was that the problem had to do with the intake valve and was covered under warranty.  The service employee recommended I have the intake valve cleaned while everything was being taken apart already under factory time.  Also great!  Took advantage of that. Now what wasn't so great - I asked them to check on the brake pads because I couldn't remember when I last had them replaced.  They recommended I replace all four pads AND rotors.  I got a bit wary here (because I didn't think they were THAT bad) and forwent this even tough they told me it was pretty dire as there was only 3mm of pad left.  To make sure, I took my car into a local body shop and had them check.  They were appalled at VWs recommendation, as my front pads looked almost new and my back were about 50% worn.  ABSOLUTELY NO NEED FOR ANY REPLACEMENTS.  Are you kidding!?

Long story short,  I was completely lied to and almost paid about $500 for no good reason.  My trust for service at this location is lost, which I am so bummed about because I was so excited to go here based on all of their good reviews. 

Better luck to everyone else!",2.6
29,"January 29, 2017","She did a good job selling me 2013 beetle, it only had 20,000 miles on it, and I bought it for 13,000 and a car is in good shape and I had no problem with it.",5.0
30,"December 27, 2016","I own a 2010 Volkswagen Jetta TDI. When the buy back first hit the news I was very disheartened because I was in love with my car. I considered myself a Volkswagen customer for life. My intention was to was to let Volkswagen correct their mistake until finding out they would no longer produce diesels in the USA. So at that point we started the paper process for a monetary buy back. A little ways into the process my check engine light came on and the car would not start. Part of the requirements for vw to repay my loan on car is for the car to be running. So I complied and towed the car to the service department at vw of the woodlands. I was told that the EGR Valve was the problem keeping the car from starting. I paid 1040.00 and still the car did not start. I was then told that the valve was masking the real problem (which was suspected to be the real issue to begin with) was the ECM the main brain of the car. vw said it would be another 1498.00 needing to be ordered from Germany and paid for up front. it took 7 weeks to come up with the money for that after being donated by a member of my church, otherwise I still would be saving. I asked why they fixed a part that didn't need to be fixed for the car to start and was told they had to fix it to properly diagnose the ECM. Which turns out to be a lie. the EGR is not needed on the car at all to run or start it is only there for the emissions to run properly.   They ordered the part said it would be 10 business days. upon the 10th day I was told the part was faulty, that a new one would be here in 3 days on the 3rd day no phone call. I called them and was told that vw COULD NOT sell the ECM in the USA because it contained the illegal software that vw was being sued over the emissions to begin with.  I asked for a full refund and was told no. I ended up speaking with Ryan the head of service he issued a refund for the ECM 1498.00 but not for the egr stating he spoke to a vw rep and that was how he got them to give me my exemption on the can needing to be running for buy back. When I told him I wanted to speak to this rep he said if he was me he wouldn't open up that can of worms it was to hard to get the exemption and vw might take it back if I continue to insist on the refund matter. My husband has signed a leagal contract saying the car runs and they have provided nothing stating we are exempt in writing. I still have to make my car loan and I have no car at all to drive. I then contacted vw customer care was assigned an advocated that only called ryan at vw of the woodlands and ryan stated he stood by their work the advocate in turns calls me and says there is nothing they can do to make them repay the money. That we was exempt though I asked when I would receive this in writing and he was under the impression we already had this. When I told him we do not he said he would get this for us, 1 week later still nothing. I then started calling the General Manger of vw of the woodlands Michael Riggs, he investigated the issue never called me back I had to call him, he said vw corp. states that tech followed proper procedure by fixing the egr because the law states it has to be running properly, that his dealership is only accountable to Volkswagen NOT THE CONSUMER. That it would be poor business for him to refund the 1040.00 just to make a customer happy. I then told him there was 2 other was to diagnose the ECM.  Told to me by other tech in in other severice dept. in vw. 1 tech he would have started by making sure that the wires had good economic for sending and receiving before fixing any part, second he would have used a DCI break out box to bypass the ECM to see if the issue went away. If this was done before fixing the egr then they would have none they couldn't get the ECM and this would not be happening to me. Both Volkswagen corp. and the vw of the woodland is pushing the blame back and forth. I was told by Michael Riggs to call customer service back and escalate the complaint maybe corp. would take care of it because they was just a tiny dealership and could not afford to take that kind of hit. I responded to him TINY I AM ONE INDIVIDUAL WHO HAS BEEN WRONGED BY YOUR EMPLOYEES AND Volkswagen. So I have done what he said called and complained got told the same thing no refund is going to be given by vw corp. have to take that up with the dealership and that someone would be contacting me about me not being able to be apart of the buy back because the car no longer runs. So I have called attorneys and most want nothing to do with it because I am technically still in the buy back as of now. One said if they kicked us out then we could start with a demand letter costing 250.00 a piece and then 2500.00 up front retainer if having to go to court he would not say an hourly rate. So I want people who have Volkswagen to BEWARE first of of this dealership because of their trickery and dishonesty. That is not just contained to the service department apparently otherwise the GM would make the situation right. So I wouldn't buy a car from them if they was the only dealership available. I also would drive as far as I had to avoid their service department Ryan the service head and Ben who no longer is with the company he is at Hyundai Huntsville so I am told. Carlton the service writer is all cons and fix to make a profit. ",1.0
31,"December 13, 2016","BUYER BEWARE……
My husband bought a used Lexus is250 from VW of the Woodlands and while the sales person was nice and did her job up to the point of the sale, there was no service after the sale for the item that still needed to be repaired as part of the sale.  It’s not like it was a little thing as the headlights are needed in order to actually drive your car at night.  It took over 2 months and several trips back and forth for the service department to finally get the headlight problem fixed.  While some issues are understandable this one was not.  How did the car pass inspection with one headlight out?  How can you sell a car knowing it is a danger and there is a headlight out and not get it in to fix right away?  How can you put the car through your service department and not change the oil but, tell your customer that it was changed?  The service department continually delayed getting the part to fix my husband’s headlight for whatever reason that was just one excuse after another as we called Northside Lexus directly and they had the part in stock and available.  It could have been bought directly from them and fixed immediately.  After numerous calls to the general manager that were never returned because he was just too busy.  Unfortunately this was not the only bad experience with this dealership.  During financing the finance manager put my husband in an extended warranty that was not what he told her he wanted.  He told her that he wanted the warranty that covered the electrical but, did not want to pay the high dollar amount that was being asked and if they could come down on the price but, still have the same coverage.  She agreed and then quickly put all his paperwork in an envelope.  After we got home we realized what she had done.  She gave him the least coverage for a lower amount which was not what had been agreed upon.  These people are very sneaky and deceitful!  Check your paperwork before you leave while there at the dealership even if you signed and think you know what you signed for!!   Don’t accept a used car from them if there is any items that need to be fixed!!  Make sure that you get it fixed before signing for anything and taking delivery of the car!!

32,"December 09, 2016","Please do yourself a huge favor and skip this  dealership if your in the market for a USED vehicle. I purchased a used Lexus IS 250 on Oct 15th this year. First I noticed the oil change sticker on the front windshield was out of date, I asked my sales person about it, and she informed me that they just forgot to replace the sticker, This was NOT true. In fact they did not change the oil or replace the air filer like she had claimed. I had to take my car to another place to get these basic things done. The day I took delivery the left front headlight was out, so they gave me a ""WE OWE"" form, which states they owed me a headlight. Not real sure how this car passed an inspection in order for them to deliver the car to me??? Yes, you guessed it right, they falsified my state inspection report in order to sell a car. The sales person never followed up with me about my headlight, so I had to call and text her every time I wanted an update on why it was taking them 3 weeks to get my headlight fixed. The first time I drove my car at night, not only did the left front headlight go out, but I lost both of my headlights. I requested that she have her GM call me, and he never did. I called their GM Michael Ricks 4 times and left 4 messages for him to call me, and he NEVER returned my call. I was told by my sales person and her used car manager Morgan that the GM was just to busy with them adding Volvo to their dealership. So, in other words he IS TO BUSY for his customers!!! EXCUSES, EXCUSES, EXCUSES....That's all I got after the sale from this place. I purchased the car on Oct the 15th and finally on December the 5th I got my car fixed.... There are plenty of dealerships in this area, so please save yourself sometime and a lot of headache, trust me, this place SUCKS!!!!!!!",1.0

Stephen was very professional, and was really knowledgeable about the vehicle we were interested in. We did not buy on our initial visit because we still wanted to consider other vehicles.

36,"September 01, 2016","Bought my VW TDI Passat two years ago at VW of the Woodlands and I can honestly say the level of customer services has severally gone downhill (BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE) at this dealer since then. I would highly recommend that you find another VW Dealer
Service: If you want to book an oil change, then it will be about a week wait (FYI they cost about $160 to $800 depending on the service interval of your TDI). They either are understaffed or don’t care (based on the attitude on the phone when booking an appointment, I would say they don’t care). My last service they spilled DEF in my Trunk making a mess and I now have white crystals growing. 

Referred Customer: I referred my brother to this dealer based on my good sales experience over a couple of years ago. The sales staff seemed less than helpful and were not interested in showing him the car he wanted. Needless to say, he went down to DeMontrond VW on 45 North, and they provided great server and bought a new 2016 SEL Passat. I can say that I won’t make the same mistake recommending anyone to visit VW of The Woodlands again. 
So to sum it up, IF SERVICE MATTERS TO YOU FIND ANOTHER DEALER!

37,"August 20, 2016","""Hi welcome to VW of the woodlands, where customer service satisfaction is our least concert and wasting your TIME and MONEY is our number one priority!"" Long story short...My husband and I bought a VW Jetta 2013 model with 14,000 miles  and we bought it Jan of 2016...factory warrant apparently went out in the middle of Feb...we took the car in one last time while it was still in warranty and told them to let us know if anything is needs to be fixed. Told us the car was fine...took it in this week for an oil change..our check engine light was on but my husband new it was the spark plugs and all he wanted was to know how much it would cost. Well Carlton in service thought it would be a good idea to exploit my husband and slip a $118 charge to our oil change because he thought that the check engine light should be diagnosed WITHOUT our permission and without the charge being said aloud to my husband. So we had to pay this in order to get our car. Called Lance who I believe is kinda like the GM of Volvo and still has some control with VW ...really nice guy but passed me along to someone at VW...I think this guy's name was Frank..he didn't really help other than tell me that Bill (head of service) would contact me...he did two hours later to basically tell me that they said the charge out loud to my husband and that ""weather he understood it or not is not there fault"" and proceeded to bicker back and fourth with me weather this amount was discussed or not...sorry but why would I go through so much trouble to get my money back if it wasn't true... he then proceeded to tell me he will discuss it with Carlton and that he would call me back....NEVER DID. 

As someone who also works with customers day in and day out this was handled very unprofessionally and when you burn bridges with a customer it is like a domino affect...you aren't loosing just me you are also loosing my friends and family. I have owned my other VW for almost ten years now and I loved it up until this incident. I will never buy VW anymore because of this and I truly hope that this location gets some serious karma for screwing people over. DONT GO HERE OR YOU WILL PAY...LITERALLY.

38,"August 05, 2016","Well if your shopping for a new or used car and you want to eliminate the stress of dealing with lengthy sales processes I suggest you give a shout out to AJ Woods at Volkswagen of the Woodlands. 

AJ assisted me in buying a 2016 VW Golf SportWagen, the unique nature of the deal was I was shopping from Dallas looking for the best deal in Texas. AJ made it a breeze to make the deal via email and a couple phone calls. When my flight arrived at Houston ITL airport AJ was there waiting to pick me up. How awesome is that? When we got to the dealership the car was detailed, the paper work was done all we needed to do was drive and sign and learn some of the features which AJ went above and beyond to make sure I knew how to operate this fine German machine.

AJ, I appreciate your great attitude and hard work, you made it a pleasure to buy a car. I will come back to buy another one when the opportunity arises.

Many thanks,

We just leased our second car from this dealership. They were so professional and efficient. We love doing business with them and we have recommended them to some of our friends and family. AJ Woods was the salesperson who helped us. Based on a telephone conversation prior to our visit, he had selected the perfect car for me. The service that he provided exceeded our expectations and made the process so easy and relaxed. He is a tremendous asset to this dealership. Also, we were in and out of the finance manager's office in less than half and hour. The entiere experience was just great.",5.0

55,"March 06, 2016","AJ and the rest of the staff from Volkswagen of the Woodlands were very attentive and extremely helpful throughout my buying process.  The fact that this dealership was roughly 5 hours away from where I live speaks to the kind of service they provide.  I was willing to drive up to this dealership because of the way AJ approached my car buying experience.  AJ was willing to listen to my needs and find the right vehicle for me and at a price that was within my budget.  Throughout the time I spent a the dealership everyone was courteous.  I plan to continue to buy from VW of the Woodlands for my upcoming vehicle purchases.

Thanks!!",5.0

60,"January 12, 2016","I had a great car buying experience with Jorge Maysonet and I would strongly recommend him for all your car buying needs. He is professional, bilingual, and knowledgeable. I was looking for a safe vehicle within a tight budget and he quickly came up with the perfect solution. He gave me several options, both new and used and was patient throughout the entire process. He found the car I wanted for the price I wanted all in the same day. I bought a 2016 Tiguan! What a car! What great features!

I will definitely return to Volkswagen Woodlands to purchase my next car from Jorge Maysonet.",5.0
61,"January 12, 2016","Tim redefined my idea of car buying. He was honest, personable and knowledgeable... but never pushy!  We drove several hours to buy from TIM. He actually made the process enjoyable. Tim Trawick will be the first person we call for our next car.",5.0
62,"December 19, 2015","We loved our sales guy AJ Woods who deserves a better place to work.  The first time we experienced bad service was when the mechanic department left off a bolt from under the car and I dragged the cover until I pulled over and rigged it til I could get to a safe place.
The second was when the mechanic shop again left off a bolt from the tire when rotating the tires. We decided not to go back to VW the Woodlands and instead bought elsewhere.
The third is when we got a gift card because of the fraudulent diesel issue and traded in the diesel, put down money to do and didn't get a good trade.  Then the sales department flat out would not allow us to activate the gift card because we didn't have possession of the fraudulent vehicle.  Glad we got rid of it and can't wait to get rid of the second VW and the new one we had to purchase to get out of the rotten diesel issue.  Truly disappointed in the mechanic shop and the sales department.",1.4

66,"December 13, 2015","I wanted a VW Beetle convertible in a hard to get color.  AJ was our salesman and he was the best!  He worked really hard at getting the car that I wanted at a fair price.  He also was great at communicating with us and letting us know where we were in the process.  I really appreciate how much he made sure that the car was spotless when we picked it up.  One of his other great qualities was that he listened to the questions that my husband asked and got the answers.  He was very professional at demonstrating the car features to me.  This was the best car buying experience that I have had in over 50 years of buying cars.  Thank you, A.J.!",5.0

68,"November 16, 2015","I interviewed all the VW dealers in Houston before settling on VW of the Woodlands.  My decision was based on the incredible quick, informative response that I initially received from AJ Woods.  My soon subsequent meeting with AJ wend extremely well: i.e., I gave him specifications for a 2016 Tourag ... he did a quick & found my car (which had just departed Germany on a boat) ... we did the deal in less than 10 min. ... he kept me apprized of the whereabouts of the ship ... he called me when the car arrived at the Port of Houston ... and then called me to ""Come and Inspect"" your selection.  A couple days later I inspected the new vehicle ... and we confirmed the original deal.  Deal Done!  I picked up the car a few days later ... and within a day or two - true to AJ's style - received a call and E-M from AJ to insure that I was happy with my purchase.  The car was for my daughter - She is Ecstatic with the car ... Soooo ... I am happy!!

As a result of the above incredible experience and confidence in AJ ... we are now working with AJ to trade in our 2014 MB E350 on a 2016 Passat (... literally returning all of my vehicles to my VW roots!).",5.0

John on the service drive was prompt, efficient, and friendly. Roni in the showroom was sooooo helpful to me in getting some critical work done to the point of allowing me to print some documents at her workstation when th visitor system would not. Above and beyond for sure. 

The work was done well. Her car was cleaned, and John kept me fully aware of the progress of the service.

I told the finance person Lupe Hernandez that we were there to buy a car not lease. At that time Mr. Hernandez lead us to believe that we were buying the vehicle after a 48 month lease with an additional 7 payments and the car was ours. We trusted the guy and he burned us put us into a 39 month lease with an option to buy for another 10,600. He basic lied to us about paymenta and terms. BEWARE PEOPLE OF THIS DEALERS SHADY PRACTICES.
