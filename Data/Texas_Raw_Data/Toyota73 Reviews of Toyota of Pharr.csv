I sat in the waiting room from 7:30 am to 11:18am and I had to go and ask about my truck which had been half way and they said it was finished.  Well after sitting for 20 more minutes they came said it was done finally. They get one star because itâ€™s as low as it can go. ,1.0

11,"November 22, 2019","As a woman I often get ignored, patronized, or just plain ripped off at car dealerships. 

Today, with the help of  Eric Cortez (salesman) and Herman Aguirre (finance consultant) I was able to purchase a 2016 Chevrolet Equinox. 

Eric was able to look out for my best interest and listened to what I was looking for. Unlike other salesmen, Eric asked what the needs of my family were and then presented the options available based on those needs.

Eric was attentive, professional, polite and went  above and beyond to make sure I had a positive experience making this purchase.

I didn't feel like I had to arm myself and try to be hard in order to be taken seriously.

Eric's main focus was not on insignificant things like the color of the  fabrics or the cupholders, but rather on the vehicle reliability, horsepower, gas efficiency, tire thread, tire age, etc.

So when you drop by Toyota of Pharr, do yourself a favor and look for Eric Cortez, he will be your salesman and your advocate. He's a godly man and will do right by you, your family and your wallet. 

God bless, 

Elida S.

18,"July 29, 2018",I was having issues with my ac took it in on Saturday 7/21/18  to get it checked out just so they can tell me thereâ€™s free on around the compressor bring it back on Monday so we can check where itâ€™s coming from. I take back on Monday I get told itâ€™s the o Rings so they would have to order them so they should be in by Wednesday and they will call me when they come in. I didnâ€™t  receive the call till Thursday so I had to go drop off my vehicle once again on Friday I was told it should be ready by 12:30 pm and around that time I receive a call that they ordered the wrong parts and I would have to take it back on Monday and be without a vehicle once again because of their careless mistake. Once I asked for management they so called found a similar part to the one they had ordered wrong and they were going to test it out to see if it worked. So they so called fixed it on Friday and not even a day and a half later itâ€™s starting to do the same thing again. Itâ€™s always the same this with this place I always have The same issues with this place trying to fix the messed up car they sold me. If I didnâ€™t have to go back to this place I would never go back anymore. Itâ€™s very disappointing having to be without a vehicle just because they canâ€™t do their job right the first time.,1.0

22,"December 23, 2016","This place has very bad service.I took my car in for an oil change and to get it checked out from the power steering so i dropped it off at 7am cuz it takes them 4 to 5 hours to do an oil change on my car cuz they don't carry the oil filter for my car.  I go back after 5 hours cuz I didn't get any calls that my vehicle was worked on so i get there wait 30 more minutes I go ask to see the status on my car just to find out the car was already checked on for the power steering and the oil change wasn't done because according to the guy I didn't mention it even though that was the first thing i mentioned. To top that off I had to wait again  another what was suppose to be a 45 minute wait that turned out to be an hour and a half. It then turns out that I went to ask if my vehicle was ready just to find out the guy was out to lunch and my car was already out from the oil change. I had to ask another asociate for my keys so I can finally go home if not I would've been there another long while, and like always they never find anything wrong with the vehicle and it makes me wonder how my usual 4 or 5 hour oil change wait  turned into an hour and a half  l highly doubt the oil filter was changed since they don't carry the oil filter for my car and they have send someone for it or atleast that's the excuse I get as to why they take so long to do my oil change. I will never purchase any vehicles from this place ever again. This happened at the Toyota service center.",1.0

25,"August 06, 2015","I came in not knowing that my credit and my circumstances were going to be a challenge. I had been in a bad car accident July 6, 2015 that totaled my trailblazer. I wasn't planning on buying a new vehicle this for the same reason credit challenge and I wanted to save up for a good down payment. Any how, when I doing some on line searching I asked for more information on a vehicle right away a very nice sales person by the name of Roland Trejo called, I explained my situation and he said he could find a way to help me. I walked in there a little hesitant because I honestly didn't think it was possible. He showed me some  cars and trucks but nothing caught my attention not even the one I had seen online. Mr. Trejo went above and beyond even on the weekend looking for vehicles that had all my wants and needs. He finally was able to find me the truck I fell in love with over a text picture. He did all he could to get me to a payment I could afford, offered me a great deal and now I am a happy owner of a GMC Terrain Denali. The paper work went so smooth that you didn't even feel the wait. Mr. Frank Enriquez made it all easy breezy. I can say I had a great experience and I know they will follow through. I highly recommend Mr. Trejo he is very knowledgeable in what he does. ",5.0

27,"July 12, 2015",I am very disappointed with this dealership. When they're trying to make a sale they are very  helpful but once your vehicle needs  service repairs you have to wait for them to have an opening in order to have you car checked and most of the time their answer is there's nothing wrong with the car. Never again will I purchase a vehicle from there.,1.4
28,"May 04, 2015","I'm very upset with deal and their practice of customer service. I'm very positive that I will never buy from Frank Smith Toyota or any Toyota dealer. When I went in, to purchase my car I made sure I told finance; I wanted to be covered in case anything happened to my car. This was so parts and labor would not cost an arm and a leg, b/c it's foreign. To my knowledge, I purchased an insurance that would help with that. Today my car went in with a problem and just to take off the tire and hubcap it would cost me $110 then parts would be extra. The insurance I purchased does nothing and the guarantee I was told about are empty words. When I asked to speak to a manager, I was denied, I was told I had to go look for one. I didn't get paper work nor a name. I will never go with such a dealer nor go with foreign vehicles.

29,"October 11, 2014","Bad experience with Internet sales manager Raul Luna. I don't know if he is just too busy or what. 

First time I went, gave him heads up that I would be there and well the power went out and he couldn't show me vehicle. 4 days later, give him heads up that I will be there, car was sold. OK, please show me other Avalons and 4 runners. He states, ""I'll be right back!"", 20 minutes later he is no where to be found?! They just leave you waiting....

I think I am just going to find myself a nice Honda, I really wanted to find a good Toyota, but the Customer Service is just not there. I just don't know what the problem with this dealership is, there were 20-30 employees sitting there doing nothing and the front store secretary was snoring as she was falling to sleep. Poor service, poorly run business. 

Quite distasteful and sours the whole experience.

33,"September 11, 2013","I purchased a vehicle here last week, and after I left with the vehicle I have received no contact as to what my next steps are. I was given no copies of any paperwork, or informed of when I could expect to get them. I had to go in and try and figure things out myself after calls to the dealership left me with unanswered questions. I left the dealership with still unanswered questions and haven't been contacted from my salesperson or the financial representative I worked with. Apparently, customers aren't number 1 at Frank Smith.",3.0
34,"February 06, 2013",I would have to say that did good job and Mario(sales) did a great job of attending to me.  Overall they are quick and friendly and Mario was honest. I would recommend Frank Smith again to friends and family.  Also the fiance department was good to me as well. ,4.8
35,"November 16, 2012","The customer service is awesome!! The environment is friendly, Genaro Davila is not a aggresive salesman worried about making a sale, he is intrested in the customers (my) intrest, he is not the type of salesman that nodes and smiles when being talked to and pertends to listen when he's not, Mr. Davila listens to what is expected from a purchase. Making the purchase of my 2013 Hyundai Sonota was a smooth & stress free descision, thanks to Mr. Davila. When explained about the APR% & monthly payments Julio Martinez couldn't have done better job, he broke it down to be clearly understood.  Usually dealing with the finance department with the signing of papers for the purchase on a vehicle is the most uncomfortable and time consuming, not with Mr. Ruiz, it wasn't just here's a paper sign, all was explained & done quickly.  The purchase of My 2013 Hyundai Sonota was a very pleasant experince.  Both Toyota & Hyundai are under the Frank Smith Dealership BUT I WOULDN'T Change My Hyundai Family for nothing in the world.

36,"November 06, 2012","This dealership is HORRIBLE.  I WILL NEVER TAKE MY CAR HERE EVER AGAIN.  Yes, I will admit that the staff may be friendly and the facility may be nice and Toyota may TRY as hard as their determined little hearts might, but none of that even BEGINS to take the edge off of the RIDICULOUS price repairs for my car and the lack of decent service I experienced while working with this dealership.
I had taken my toyota in and it was diagnosed with two leaking breaks on the backwheels, a leak in the engine, and a leak in the water coolant which added up to a whopping  $2,700.00.  I thought for certain that they were joking!  Was the sealant they were using on my car taken from the Hubble Space telescope and I had to pay for the rocket fuel they needed to get there?  Or was it from Tony Stark's Iron Man suit?  Was I on Candid Camera?
Even worse was that I didn't even get my car on the projected day and I did not even receive any form of notification. Does this dealership think I can put my life on pause?  Do they believe that just because I don't have my car I magically don't have to run errands of my daily life or go to work?  Because let me tell you that it certainly, definitely, absolutely, positively, unconditionally, unequivocally, irrefutably, undoubtedly DOESN'T.  
I AM SEVERELY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS DEALERSHIP, especially since it tries so hard to project a professional, customer-friendly front.  I was tragically misleaded!  ",1.8

They never mark up the prices of their cars to where I feel like I need to gear up for a negotiation battle; when I go in for service, I've never felt pressured or hassled to buy more than what I initially went in for; and I get freshly baked cookies and a manicure while I wait - shut the hell up it's AWESOME! Plus, they have quality vehicles that I never have problems with and never worry about high maintenance fees like other luxury vehicles. They're dependable, cost effective, and I get compliments on my car all the time. I'd like to think it's because I make my Toyota look good, but deep down I know the truth :) and that's okay.",5.0

63,"October 30, 2011","Our experience with Frank Smith Toyota was really exceptional.  David, the sales representative, really dedicated lots of time with us and did not pressure us at all to make a purchase.  He was very knowledgeable, patient and had a great sense of humor. 

We were looking for a good, safe car for our daughter that is attending college away from home and comes home to visit.  She had been involved in a car accident and needed to replace her car.  We had been looking for three weeks and had been through lots of dealerships, high pressure sales reps. and even a very rude and unprofessional sales person at Berg Ogden BMW.  Our experience with David was very good and he listened to our needs and made every effort to get us a car that met our needs.  It took several trips to the dealership but we finally got the car that not only met our needs but exceeded our expectations!  Our daughter can't believe the great car that she got to replace her other one. We are all very happy with the purchase and feel really good about.

Everyone at Frank Smith Toyota was great!  David Rodriguez, Genardo Davila and Ivan all worked together to find us the perfect car, at the right price to meet our needs and our daughters'.

We know that she will be traveling in a safe, cost efficient vehicle that will last her throughout her college years and beyond. I would recommend this dealership and David, Genardo and Ivan to anyone looking for a vehicle.  This has been our second purchase there and I'm more than sure that my next vehicle will be from there.  As soon as our kids are all out of school it will be my turn for a new car and that's where I will go for it.

64,"September 21, 2011","Gus De Leon at Frank Smith Toyota made me a believer that the ideal dealership experience does exist, every one should go buy from him and his sales team, don't waste your time elsewhere, let me tell you why!

For my first new vehicle purchase, my journey took me to several other dealerships throughout the Rio Grande Valley, and nobody else treated me like Gus. It all began by giving me a friendly, no-pressure phone call to setup an appointment to help me out during my visit after requesting an internet quote, and you could tell he knew his stuff because he handled my questions right there on the spot before agreeing to come in. After wasting my time at other dealers where people were pushy, rude, inexperienced, and one even seemed uninterested in my business, decided to take my final test drive with Gus, and wow did his service impress me!

Right off the bat this guy has a zen-like calmness about him, totally confident about his product knowledge and never ever trying to push a sale, I'd say his approach is more like trying to match your needs with their products and he does it very well, I walked in interested in a base model and walked out with a fully loaded model. Gus actually took the time to ask, learn, and understand my plans for this new vehicle, rather than applying some corny cookie-cutter pitch like others did, and truly matched my personal and professional needs perfectly because not a single day goes by that I'm not extremely happy about driving it.

Have you ever made a payment with a smile? Gus certainly made sure by helping me figure out all the qualifying discounts available at my time of purchase, that's something you rarely see, you can really tell the guy cares about his customers and makes it a no-brainer to recommend him to the point that I'm not interested in talking with anybody else for my next vehicle purchases.

If you want to make the best and last dealership relation you'll ever need, please go by and ask for Gus De Leon, you won't regret it and you'll see what you've been missing, tell him Luis Gutierrez sent you!",5.0

The follow-up was incrediable also, making it seem as if ""big brother"" was making sure I did the right thing. I look forward to being a lifetime customer and friend to each person I come in contact with at the dealership, and will be back for another purchase and will recommend Frank Smith to everyone.  Thanks.",5.0

This time it was suggested that my Scion xB, with 22,000 miles have its fuel injectors cleaned and have a throttle body service. I was in for service due to second failed ignition coil.",2.2

I originally was treated like royalty by Rick Escobar , then Luis and Genaro showed me the details of the car and I can only say good things about them. You got a great team! In addtion they worked out  a great price and kept their word in every  detail. Integrity is key when you are buying a car and these guys have it in spades. ",5.0
