7,"May 11, 2020","Worst experience buying a new vehicle.  I was sold a car and told I would be able to start it remotely.  Not true, the car did not have floor mats when I picked it up either and there was cat hair in the back seats.  New car?  When I called back I was treated like I was not reasonable for wanting what I was told I would get with the vehicle.  I do admit I was angry, but you would too if you upgraded for $5k more only to find out that’s not what you bought.  I have to meet with them to see how we can correct this but I feel my trust was broken and I am very anxious about the purchase I made.  I do not like to feel this way.  Go buy somewhere else, these people are not trustworthy.  That is funny that I get this apology comment on my review, but when I call the dealership I was told, ""we cannot help you and this is not Walmart, it is your word against our sales man word and he would never do that!""  Newsflash, he did lie to me to make the sale and the dealership does not take responsibility for the lies of their Employees.  I want to take the little frame off my plate as soon as I get the plates, because I never want to be associated with Tejas Toyota; they have no regards for their Customers.  While they are trying to take your money they will treat you very kind but treat you like a peasant afterwards. RUN AWAY FROM THIS PLACE",1.0

21,"February 06, 2020","Without a doubt the best experience I have had with service at a dealership. They beat BMW, Lexus Dealers, and Cadillac that I have dealt with, in the past. True excellence in communication, workmanship and the best attitude of all, by far. When I make an appointment, my car is taken in quickly, and I am ushered to a comfortable seating area complete with coffee,donuts, tv, wifi and nice seating. It never takes long to get things done here, as the shop is well managed.

22,"February 05, 2020","Vehicle is a 2019 Tacoma with 12k miles. Had a problem with the iphone charger. The rubber cover was bubbling up preventing the phone from laying flat and charging. I went to Fred Haas who wanted to charge me $150 ""diagnostic fee"".  Nope, not happening.
Went to Tejas and met with service advisor Don Waters. He took it back to the techs and determined they had to order a part and it would be covered under warranty. Two days later the part came in and he called me to schedule the repair. When I got there he offered a shuttle ride home, but I decided to wait on it. About an hour later it was done. Seems to be fixed properly and covered under warranty without any ""diagnostic fee"" nonsense. Don seems to be really a straight up guy. I will go back to Tejas for service. I have had no experience with the sales department.",5.0

46,"November 01, 2019","The service rep was great, as they always are, but the actual service is waaaaay too slow. 3.5 hours for Scheduled oil change tire balance is insane. This needs to change or I am forced to elsewhere. Just do not have time to hang out at the dealer for routine items. Sad",3.0
47,"October 30, 2019","I have 3 years with my car and I Keats have done service in  Toyota Don Mcgill... but today I went to Tejas Toyota because it was near there ... it took 3 hours to make a simple oil change but before that they told me that the Oil drain screw was broken and I they recommended to change it by buying a kit or changing the carter. It is the most ridiculous and illogical thing I've heard and all for going to that dealer that apparently the mechanics are trained to say that nothing works and the customer decides whether or not to change the part😡

54,"October 11, 2019","Tejas Toyota has an inexperienced, untrustworthy service department. I would highly recommend bringing your car elsewhere. We’ve been bringing both our vehicles here for years and haven’t been very impressed, but it was always the closest. After our last visit, we will never be back and will be filing complaints through every means necessary. We brought our car in for it’s dead battery and also mentioned that the radio keeps rebooting, which has been happening for over a year, and we had already brought it in for this issue and it was never resolved. They said they would charge a diagnostic fee that could be applied to any work done. They called us later that evening to tell us that they performed a software update on the stereo, but unfortunately, the battery for my Highlander was back ordered until Thanksgiving at the earliest. (1.5 months away) They gave us the option of leaving the vehicle there until then or having them install an Interstate battery that isn’t right for our vehicle and we would need to disable the start/stop feature every time we turn on the vehicle. Then we can order the back ordered battery. We said this was not an acceptable solution to pay for two batteries, install one that isn’t correct for the car and have to disable settings every time the car is started. They also quoted $450 for the second battery install. We spoke with two other Toyota dealerships who said that there was not a back order on the Toyota battery and they had plenty. One of the dealerships, where my vehicle was purchased, looked and verified that it was the appropriate battery for my specific vehicle. both dealerships quoted $170 to have this battery installed. In the morning, we went back to the dealership. We relayed the information we had received. He spoke to the manager and told us there was a misunderstanding and their Toyota rep said this other battery would be fine and work fine for our car, and we didn’t need the $450 back ordered battery. We went ahead and let them install the new battery that they quoted $190 for. When we went to check out, they tried to charge us the $190 plus $130 for the stereo software update. We never provided authorization for a software update or was told about the $130 charge until check out. We were obviously very upset and the manager came out. He told us that the $130 software update shouldn’t matter because we were going to have to pay the $130 diagnostic charge anyways... funny that they were the same price. We would not have agreed to pay $130 for the software update and would have chosen to apply the diagnostic fee to the battery cost. The advisor lied in front of me to the manager, that I had authorized. Come to find out after reviewing the paperwork, they ended up not installing a Toyota battery and installed the Interstate one that they said wouldn’t properly work with the start/stop feature. Then, the manager went into another explanation about how it “should” work. We did not realize they were installing this battery on our car. We wish would have just taken our car to one of the other dealerships we spoke to. At the end of the day, he removed the $130 software update charge in order to get us out of there, but could never provide an explanation that made any sense as to why there was all this confusion regarding the battery and essentially told me that both of the other dealerships lied to us and they knew what they were talking about. We are not sure if Tejas is sorry incompetent or lied, but something is not right. At the end of the day, we have a battery in our car that we aren’t sure is correct and we would not have chosen to install, the problems with our stereo still exist (software update did nothing) and here’s the kicker... we get home and put the paperwork in the glove compartment and they had BROKEN the glove compartment on my car. (Was opening and closing just fine before we dropped off) We are now going to have to still try to get our stereo problems figured out, figure out if the battery is correct and get the glove compartment repaired. My car is only 3 years old.",1.0

99,"November 29, 2018","Made an appointment the day before to get 70K service done on 2013 Highlander. Not much to do on this interval - oil change, tire rotation, fluids, and inspections. Cost was reasonable and one special request was done. I would have given an excellent rating had it not been for two items. One, the tires were over inflated - 36 psi instead of the recommended 30 psi. I will often overinflate the tires in the fall to compensate for cooling temperatures. Never by 6 psi, usually 1 psi is enough. I have had the same issue with previous Toyota service at a different dealership. Second, the service was completed in 75 minutes , which is very reasonable. But the vehicle was parked and ready to pick up 20 minutes before I was called review the service and pay the bill. I did not see the service advisor during that time. Slightly annoying, could be better.",4.4

I was slow to move and could not get motivated very quickly due to the accident I was in and everyone showed me so much respect. Brian definately goes out of his way to treat a customer as they should be treated. He is an amazing person. Not like the persona that most car salesman give to the public.

My wife loves the new Scion xB that we just purchased. I would recommend any and everyone I know to go and shop for a new car here. My next purchase is definitely going to be from these guys.",5.0

190,"June 19, 2011","Today (06/18/11) I went to Tejas Toyota car shopping with my 18 y/o daughter.  We walked into Tejas Toyota and they were obviously busy so we stood and waited for someone to come assist us.  While standing there waiting, a large man (salesman?) sat at his desk and more than twice looked up at me only to ignore me.  After standing there about 5 minutes a male customer enters the store (I am a female and mind you we are standing right inside that door) and the large car salesman runs right over to him to ask if he could assist him.  I just stood there as my jaw dropped in disbelief!  I said in a raised voice, ""REALLY???""  I explained that I had been standing there only to be ignored and a male customer walks in and he runs right to him.  This less than a man car salesman tells me that they obviously are not going to be able to help me and that I could leave!  We did just that.  We left and went to ROBBINS CHEVROLET where we were treated very nicely and my daughter bought a 2010 Toyota Corolla.  Way to go Tejas Toyota!!  I'm sure Robbins Chevrolet appreciates that and the fact that it gives them more business.  This was not racial discrimination as I am 42 y/o, upper middle class and white.  It was very much sexual discrimination by that particular weasle.  There was one car salesman who was much older who came over profusely apologizing for they way the weasle acted.  The older gentleman was a sweetheart, but I want nothing to do with a business that employs people like the large weasle working for them!",1.0
191,"May 15, 2011","When a dealer charges you an up charge for the privilege of buying a car form them, it says alot about how they do business. If they charge $5000.00 extra on a car it means they don't do much business and have to make it up somewhere. Do your self a favor and check their dealer rating in Houston and shop somewhere else. You will be glad you did ",1.8
192,"April 13, 2011","This was one of the best experiences I've ever had with a dealership.  I dropped my truck off as a result of a noise I was hearing somewhere in the dashboard area.  It turns out it was a loose bracket on the firewall in the engine compartment.  It came loose when a local car wash place detailed my engine.  I had tried furiously to figure out what the cause was to no avail.  Mike, Floyd and Russell at Tejas went well beyond their normal process to troubleshoot, identify, and solve this issue.  This is why I would recommend this dealership very highly to anyone needing their services.  Our family has bought 6-8 cars and trucks from them over the years - they are our ""Go-To"" dealer because they are always fair, willing to go the extra mile with anything we need.  I would recommend them to anyone in a heartbeat.

Thank you Tejas",5.0
193,"April 09, 2011","I purchased a Rav4 from this dealership in 2007 with a typical new-car, high-pressure, low-customer-service experience. Trying to get it serviced at the dealership was a nightmare - hours of waiting each time. Once after being dropped off at the nearby mall for several hours while awaiting service, I was stranded there with children for over an hour after I phoned in (nobody ever called me) to find that my car was ""ready."" Upon finally being picked up and returned to the dealership, I was informed that the service I had requested HAD NOT EVEN BEEN PERFORMED because it wasn't yet time for that scheduled maintenance! I was happy to not spend money I didn't need to, but they couldn't have told me that before wasting half my Saturday and dealing with all the frustration and inconvenience? Also, I had purchased the fabric protection and ended up with a stain on the driver's seat I couldn't get out. They made a half-hearted attempt to remove it, then informed me I had to schedule a weekday appointment for that service; rather than lose time from work, I lived with the large unsightly spot for several years.

All that being said about the dealership, I really loved my car. I recently returned to see about replacing it with a newer Rav4, and had a terrible experience in sales. The salesman was pushy and obnoxious and kept trying to get me interested in a more expensive vehicle. Toyota has become very proud of their Rav4 despite all the recalls; there was no wiggle room on pricing, plus I was flat-out insulted at the financing and the offer made for my trade-in. They seemed very uninterested in selling us a car, so we obliged them by walking out. I just bought a Mitsubishi from Gillman - it was a night and day difference, and I love my new Outlander, my new service department, and my 100K warranty! Don't waste your time with Tejas.",2.0
194,"February 17, 2011","Great service, no hassels. Buying a new vehicle can be stressful, they were able to take the stress out of the experience. Sales personnel were very knowledgable and did everything possible to make sure we received the specific vehicle we were looking for. They will be highly recommended.",5.0
195,"November 06, 2007","I used to visit Tejas Toyota's parts counter when I worked out at the airport in Houston.  The parts counter and service departments were open until midnight on weekdays and it was just really convienient for me to stop by after work at 11 pm for misc parts and the usual oil filter.  

Any time after 10pm was usually dead in there so there was absolutely no wait time.  You walked in the door and were greeted by the part counter man and great service followed.  All of the people I dealt with at this dealer were friendly and nice.  One of the guys even showed me what dealer cost for the parts was and what price I would pay since I was paying retail.  My knowing this information did not change the price for me but was interesting to see.  Of course, all dealers mark up wholesale prices 10-20% but I found Tejas to mark up less than other Houston area Toyota dealers.  

The cashier on duty at night was also friendly and would make small talk with me instead of keeping it all business and cold.  I would point anyone to Tejas Toyota for parts.  Be sure to go late at night to avoid the crowds and deal with the best people at this dealership.",4.8
196,"October 11, 2003",I paid for a replacement of transmission pan gasket along with fluid change.  After picking up car I notice an oil leak and lhe dealer asked that I return the car.  He put it on the lift and said I had an engine oil pan gasket leak and wanted to repair it.   He pointed out the leak while it was on the lift and at the same time I looked at the transmission pan gasket and noticed it was not even touched.  I showed the service advisor and he said OOPS! Sorry we  did not do the work and will jump right on it.  The service advisor would not give me a receipt of the REDO.,1.3
