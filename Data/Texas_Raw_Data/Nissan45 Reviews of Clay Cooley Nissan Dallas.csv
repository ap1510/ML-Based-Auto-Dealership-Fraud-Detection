1,"December 29, 2017","These guys will lie and lie to you again and again!  They are selling hail damaged vehicles as new.  They won't even tell you unless you ask for a report stating there has not been any damage to the vehicle.

We are talking about NEW vehicles with 25 miles on them.  But they have had extensive glass breakage and hail dent repairs.

They will not tell you unless you ask for a printed statement stating whether there has been damage.

I highly encourage you to buy elsewhere!  BEWARE!!!!!!",1.6
2,"April 24, 2017","I just had a very dissatisfying experience with this dealership.  I was interested in a certified used car they listed on their website.  So going from experience with other dealers,  I contacted the dealership to verify the car was still in stock and available.  I received an email response at 11:45 am letting me know that they indeed had the car and asked when I would be in to look at it.  Since I live about one hour away, I told them I could be there by 1:30 pm.

I then got ready and actually made good time, arriving at 1:15 pm.  Mind you only 1-1/2 hours after getting the assurance the car was available.  Guess What!  I get there and they ""can't find"" they keys.  After about 30 min., they tell me that the car was sold this morning... Funny how they had someone look at and buy the car in the 15 min. remaining in the morning after they told me it was available.

Of course they were more than willing to show and sell me other cars they did have.  Of course more expensive than the one I was interested in.

Bottom line....  I have had this happen before and will not be making any return trips to this dealership.  Regardless of how good of a deal they advertise.  They obviously do not value their Customer's time.  Be educated ave your money and avoid them.",1.7
3,"August 26, 2016","We had the WORST experience with AutoNation Nissan. I would not recommend this dealership to anyone. Beware of inaccurately represented cars here. After countless hours, 6 visits to the dealership, and going through 4 different cars we finally and unhappily walked out with a vehicle. My fiancé and I were shopping for a 2016 Nissan Maxima and had found one at AutoNation Nissan Dallas. After getting a good quote that said the car had 15 miles on it, my fiancé went to purchase the car—I’ll call it Car #1. While waiting on finance, he test drove Car #1 and it turned out it had close to 4000 miles on it instead of the 15 miles on the quote. That’s clearly not a new car. The salesman promised to get another car for us from a different dealership in the color of our choice. There was a lot of back and forth, and the salesman got another 2016 Maxima in to the dealership (in the wrong color, but we decided to look at it anyways) and we went to test drive and hopefully buy this car—Car #2. Everything seemed good about Car #2, but the back seatbelt didn’t buckle. So they took it to maintenance to replace the back seat and when they pulled the seat out, they found a bunch of broken glass in the back and in the trunk. Car #2 had hail damage, presumably, that was undisclosed. They apologized and said they would get another car for us and that they would look it over thoroughly before we got it. We went back to the dealership to check out Car #3 which they had brought in from another AutoNation dealership. The salesman had apparently looked over it and the miles were accurate, there was no glass in the back seat, and things were supposed to be good. I took a quick look at this Car #3 and there was clear hail damage on the roof of the car, the hood of the car, and the trunk of the car—probably at least 5 noticeable dents and once I started looking harder, there were at least 15-20 dents all over Car #3 that were deemed to be irreparable. Again, undisclosed hail damage. Clearly the salesman either didn’t look over Car #3 or he was incompetent to tell if a car was in selling shape. This was our 5th visit to the dealership and we left without a car AGAIN. The salesman and sales manager were apologetic and said they would have another car for us and that they would make it right. We went back later that week, our 6th time to the dealership, to look at Car #4. We finally walked out with this car, after haggling more over the prices. I am extremely unhappy with the entire experience. I feel that the whole situation was completely dishonest as 3 out of 4 cars were inaccurately represented to us, and I hope that people read this review and take their business elsewhere so they don’t end up with cars that have hidden issues that AutoNation Nissan hasn’t disclosed. Our Salesman Charles Thrower and his Sales Manager Garrett Polanco were nice, but for them to try and sell us 3 flawed cars before finally getting one right is completely unacceptable. ",1.2
4,"August 20, 2016","For apx. 3 months a salesperson Charles had been contacting me sometimes three times a week.  He proceeded each time to explain they desperately needed to buy my Altima since they were in High Demand.  I was in the market for the 2016 Frontier, and decided to come in (even though his persistence was annoying, and previous bad experiences from them).

Seeing that I lived over an hour and a half away, and work a great deal of hours I asked if all of my paperwork besides the vehicle appraisal could be completed previous to coming in.  I sent appropriate information, and was told that my vehicle would be written off to a zero balance as well as the new vehicle start over fresh with payments.  Stipulations for me coming in were to have a lower payment, lower interest rate, and not owe anything on my trade in.  I was told all of this was ALREADY approved.

LIES LIES LIES LIES....

No paperwork completed, no credit check completed, no recollection as to my trade in of the Altima being involved, and to top it all off they were not even going to offer fair market trade in value. Also, no actual knowledge about the 2016 Frontier SV which I was going to purchase.

After wasting about an hour and a half of my time, and continuing to play the ""Sales Game"" (of which I am NOT intimidated by anyone) he left the ""Cubicle"" twice, came back each time telling me, ""You're ok with this"", which was a significantly higher payment, and I would owe a signficant amount on the Altima. 
No, I am NOT ok with someone who lacks understanding of what they are trying to sell.  I am NOT ok with someone wasting my time, and spitting lies every other phrase.

The third time anyone came back with an offer, he sent in the finance person.  He wouldn't even come back himself.  WIMP!
Charles Thrower from AutoNation Dallas Lies, and knows NOTHING about the vehicles in which he is ""trying"" to sell.

I will not be back to buy my Mom an Armada, and anyone who sparks the conversation will learn of the incompetent employees of AutoNation.  (This is not the first bad experience, just the newest)",1.4
5,"May 23, 2016","We were working with them on a lease and they do not honor schedule appointment. Instead of apologizing for the lateness of his salesmen, or find someone else to help us; the Manager, whom I can only assume had his customer service training at the DMV, told us ""If you don't want to wait there are other Nissan dealerships out there."" They don't want your business here! If their Manager have that mentality, imagine what their sales and service staff must be like! ",1.0
6,"March 20, 2015","This dealership has a flawed process to handle warranty work. Less than a week after buying a vehicle, it went back for a warranty repair. They made us wait three days to get warranty approval to perform the repair. In the mean time we were told that they had to order a replacement part. 
The real reason why the repair was delayed is because they needed approval from the warranty although the vehicle was purchased less than a week.

This is totally unacceptable. They were prompt to cash the check the same day they receive it but they can't process a warranty repair in three days?

The sale process was very efficient. Kimberly handled it in a very professional and friendly manner.

If these reviews are read by someone at the dealership, they need to know there is room for improvement in the way warranty repairs are handled. Please do not make your customers wait when you have all the information at your fingertips.

7,"April 16, 2014","Great Dealership.  Not only did they have the lowest Internet Price BY FAR....but they were the friendliest.  The first time I visited, they were not able to get where I wanted to be.  I wanted a deal since it was the end of the fiscal year.  However, I called 5 days later and upped my offer and was able to negotiate completely by email.

It was a great experience, did not have the typical sales negotiation in the dealership, which could easily waste over an hour.  ",5.0
8,"March 19, 2014","So to start this was my first dealership to work with me alone.   I have had help with my dad in the past so i was pretty on nerves when i first went in.  No one helped us when we were looking on the lot.  we went into the dealership to get help.  This is when we first encountered Gina.  She was very nice and advised that she wasnt a sales man but would help us get into a car.  We drove what i was looking for then she said why dont you look at the step above, as we did i feel in love with something that was out of my league.  We got credit info and i said we would talk about it.  We went back up there 3 days later, due to an emergency in the hospital.  They sold all the vehicles except 2 that we were looking for.  they both were black.  I was not a fan but i was ok with the decision and decided to keep my loyalty with them since they were so nice at first.  Gina was no longer around due to her own personal reasons so i had to deal with 3 men.  They first were not going to give me the internet price and then finally broke down.  The car was in the repair shop due to a sticker not coming off correctly and had to fix it so i did not see it until friday.  so this is going on a week.  My dad was going to cosign for me and we were going to go through my bank, since that is who i have done business with on my previous car.  They advise they would need to have him show up in person due to a special pad he would need to sign.  My dads time is not something to work with since he works 7 days a week, so after they told us multiple times he would have to come up here my dad made plans with his work.  I signed the paper work on Friday after about a few hrs of waiting for someone to finally help me.  my dad comes up here and signs without even an explanation to what he is signing, which hes purchased alot of cars and they way they were acting was a little standoffish.  They were pushing their financing down my throat the day before, but when i found my bank was going to finance me at a completely lower rate there was no way i could pass it up.  The paper work did not get to my bank until Monday afternoon, after my bank called and then had to call me to see what was going on.  no one was calling her back or even wanting to speak with her.  After she got the information she advised they were charging me over price and the warranty they added was too much and she could get one at a lower rate.  I emailed over the information to gary and said we need to take off the warranty and be at a price point or we would go somewhere else.  He again pushes his financing and i said no i will not do that with the lower rate from my bank.  I drove up there and asked if he can fedex the paper work to my dad this time because he can not come up here. he now said that would be no problem.  He sends the paper work fedex and my dad takes it up to the bank to make sure its where we need to be at.  they added tinting on to the price, i did not ask to have it on but was listed as what we were owning.  we were 600 dollars difference to what was asked by my bank and myself when we stated we can go to this price and that price is what the value of the car was so after ttl were noted we needed to be on point.  He again forced his financing down my throat and at this point i was done.  I stated if you can not give us this at the price we need to be i will bring the car back up there after i get off work.  This was a total of 2 weeks 1 week of actually driving and being in limbo with paperwork and such.  I did not enjoy the car because of the stress it was causing and was done with it.  No way did they try to work with me on taking off the tinting, they were being rude towards myself, my family and the bank that has helped me out when i needed it.  I am a loyal customer and i felt like i was being used.  My partner called as spoke with gina who had no clue as to the issues that were going on.  she called her back and said well she said she was done if i even try to get 300 knocked off i would have to go over my bosses head to do that.  She wasnt even willing to help me after she stated she was going to get me into the car period, because she didn't do that before calling back and said sorry.  I drove the car, after 400 miles of my own driving and 200 they lied about what was posted on the internet, apparently they do not update the internet for days so good luck on when u get into a vehicle there.  i took that car back refused to walk into the dealership, as i was hurt by these people i trusted, and they walked the car 2 times and we left.  They then tried to bash my dad and my bank to my partner like they wanted to get a rouse out of them but she ended with i dont know the conversation i was not there.  None of these people spoke with my dad and only 1 person spoke with my bank lady, these people had no right to take judgement on someone they never spoke with.  After we left there we went to Don Davis and got into a vehicle the same as we drove for a week, and it was the color i wanted.   There was more options there because they are number 1 selling in texas and maybe nationwide.  I would never ever recommend anyone to go to auto nation they will take you for all you have take the time and do the research, it was a great learning experience for me but would not recommend anyone to go through that.  One stop shop is Don Davis not AutoNation/Bankston.  

Research when you go car shopping and do not go with what they have there are options out there they may not have because they are not number 1.  
Oh and they will tell you this special pad will need to be signed, which is total crap i signed on no special pad and their lies will not end there....  do not trust what the manager states because clearly other dealerships, which i called, are able to work with anyone out of town by fedex/ups.  total crap.  they will waste more time out of you and anyone who is helping you to get into a vehicle......  NO SPECIAL PADS AT DON DAVIS ",1.6
9,"September 27, 2013","Poor customer service overall.  

All the staff works here is very very SLOW and Un-Friendly.  

Very Expensive Parts and Labor... 

I DO NOT Recommend anyone to do service here unless you want to waste 3 hours for your oil change.

10,"August 10, 2013","I negotiated a price for a 2013 Altima over the phone with Robert Edwards and Daniel Brown. On the way from Plano I called the dealership and spoke with Robert Edwards telling him I was on the way to buy the Altima. He said he would pull the car up front.
 When I arrived I was passed off to Les Hopkins who informed me that the car I thought I was buying wasn't at the dealership. We walked out and drove to Don Davis Nissan in Arlington and bought the car. Don Davis is really good, by the way.

11,"July 17, 2013","On first visit, they were very busy but James made sure to take care of me when I was there.  The following day, Richard called me to see if there was anything they could do to win my business.  I told him the deal I wanted and he worked to make it happen.  I returned to the dealership and he held to his word.  I am a buyer by profession, so I am not an easy person to sell anything to, and I am highly critical on retail experiences.  I wouldn't be writing this if I hadn't been given a high level of service.  The day after I took delivery, I took it back to have the tire pressure adjusted, and you would have thought I had been a VIP-I called James ahead of time and he had a guy waiting to take care of me.  I will say their follow up was as good as when they sold me the car, which is unusual these days.  Kudos to James and Richard for making my experience a pleasant one that left me with a car I love.",5.0
12,"July 15, 2013","I was very disappointed when I was scheduled to meet Daniel Brown at the dealership on Saturday July 13th, 2013 and discovered that he was not available. I was told by sales manager Les Hopkins that he was not even a sales person, but, rather an appointment maker. I was also disappointed to discover that the car we spoke of was not on the lot for a test drive. It gives me the distinct impression that this  dealership has deceptive practices designed to lure people in under false pretenses. needless to say I will not be purchasing a vehicle from Auto Nation Nissan Dallas.

14,"May 10, 2013","My experience with Auto Nation, especially Mark and Scott, was the best experience I have every had purchasing a vehicle.  I was treated with such respect and friendliness...it was unbelievable.  They went out of their way to make my purchase of a new vehicle (something that I thought was impossible) happen.  Mark and Scott are the type of salesmen that make people want to purchase a vehicle from the dealership.  Also, the finance department is the best.  I was treated like a real  person by them and they went above and beyond to make my purchase happen.  My whole experience was the best and I will never buy my car from anywhere but Auto Nation....They are the best in the business!",5.0
15,"May 09, 2013","Robert was very knowledgible of the Nissan Leaf and did a great job meeting my pricing requests.
No pressure and hard working. The Leaf is a great product but requires many questions to be 
answered due to the differences between electric and gas cars.  It is hard to go into a change 
in the car you drive without having someone with expertise in these cars to be there when checking them out.
Robert has that level of expertise on these.  Thanks!!",5.0
16,"April 09, 2013",After the sale is the issue!  After numerous years of supporting this dealership I have finally realized that I do not matter.  My money can be spent elsewhere.  If you go for service be careful and stay on top of what is going on.  ,2.3
17,"March 26, 2013","I had a great experience at AutoNation Nissan.  In fact, the salesman (Anthony) knew before I did which vehicle would be a better fit for me because he listened to what I needed.  This is my fifth Nissan vehicle and this was the best experience I have ever had buying a car - I will definitely use this dealership in the future and I highly recommend them.",5.0
18,"October 27, 2012","I have purchased cars in the past but hated to go to dealerships. I decided to stop by the Dallas location I worked with Dean Aikins. And wow I was very pleased with the hole experience. Before you decide to buy a car somewhere else stop by and see Den Aikins. He will help you find exactly what you are looking for , work hard to get you the best deal and best of all NO pressure. Check him out you will not regret it. ",5.0
19,"October 14, 2012","My husband and I had a great experience at Bankston Dallas!  This is my second vehicle purchased from Bankston Dallas, and we would recommend this dealership to anyone looking for a new car.
I began my car search online looking at their inventory..  Mr.Aikins responded very quickly with helpful information, and setting up a time to come in.  Even though I literally rescheduled my appt. 2 or 3 times, he continued to have a positive attitude, and went the extra mile as a sales associate.  

When finally arriving at Bankston, Dean helped us locate vehicles that we wanted in the price range we could afford.  He made the experience extremely pressure free, and easy.

We liked our first car buying experience at Bankston, and this one was even better.  A big thanks to Bankston and Mr. Aikins for their dedication to customer satisfaction.  Finding a car salesman with an easy going attitude who was able to create a stress free environment was wonderful.  Looking forward to continuing working with Bankston in the future.",4.8
20,"October 10, 2012","Purchased this car through USAA Buying Service.  USAA sent my request to three dealers.  Within minutes of entering request to USAA, I received a phone call from Dan Brown.  Dan did the initial work to find the exact car I was looking for (2013 Nissan Altima SL).  I specifically wanted an Altima with the Tech Package (Navigation, XM-Sirius Radio, and some other things), mainly to get the larger console display.  Of course I also had a couple of desirable colors in mind. After Dan located the car I was looking for, Kimberly Lawrence worked with me to get a deal closed.  At no time did I feel pressured.  They met all my requirements and needs at a great price.  I've been driving the car for just over two weeks and have about 1,200 miles on it.  It's a great car, and Bankstan Nissan was a great car buying experience.  I would recommend them to anyone.",5.0
21,"July 31, 2012",I really liked the environment. The people was very nice.  The salesman I worked with name is Tony Gadsona. He was great to work with. What I loved about him most is he took the time to work with my negative factors and made sure I walked out with a vehical at a reasonable price. it was a pleasure doing buisness there.,4.8
22,"July 05, 2012","We purchased a new Nissan Xterra from Bankston and it had a couple of minor factory flaws.  We live in Houston so the dealership assured us that Mossy Nissan in Houston would take care of us.  Bankston gave us a contact person and said Mossy was informed and we were ready to go.

I made an appointment with Mossy Nissan in Houston, took the vehicle in and they had no idea what I was talking about.  Bankston had not contacted them, ordered the part; NOTHING!  Then, they wouldn't return my email or calls.  They were happy to sell me the vehicle but the after service was awful.

23,"July 01, 2012","This is the most honest and geniune car dealership I have ever been to... They take their time and get to know you, what you like, and are willing to work with any situation and are very humble. After I filled out the application, Dean called me back and told me I was approved. I was shocked because I didn't have the best credit in the world but he promised me that I would be fine and that he would take care of me.. 2 hours later, the General Manager called me and personally thanked me and was very humble.. I was shocked not many GM's do that. I get there and Dean couldn't assist me so Anthony(Tony) assisted and he couldn't be more honest. The car we actually saw was online a trade in lemon and he would never sell that car, which let me know he was honest. There was no sales pressure and I was confident they had my best interest! I drove off in a Altima for my exact budget. If you tell them your budget they find it! They didn't try to talk me into paying anything extra or getting something better. BRAVO GUYS!!

35,"March 10, 2011","I wanted to thank all of you @ Bankston Nissan especially Mr.Les Hopkins for how easy it was to buy a car from your dealership. He made sure that I walked away thinking it couldn't have been any easier than this. Everything was sorted out, explained and made clear enough for anyone to understand. I love my car and couldn't ask for anything more. Purchasing my vehicle was a wonderful experience!! The vehicle's price, quality and especially the customer service by Les was top of the line. The car is fantastic as I am extremely impressed at the overall quality of the car and I take pride in showing it off to my friends who actually just love the car!!!! 

I have to give you guys a triple plus rating for your service as I came in a couple of times and Les took perfect care of the situation and addressed all my concerns. Infact he also made sure to send me follow up emails after the purchase of my vehicle to make sure everything was ok. This made me even more comfortable about choosing your dealership for doing business. I am pleased that the spirit of service is so strong with your dealership. Good job guys. Very satisfied!!!!!!
The commitment to taking care of your customers is a RARITY these days, and this is so greatly appreciated at your dealership. Your care in dealing with me has really made an impression, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend you to my friends or family.

Thanks again for all your hard work in making my purchase easy and stress free as now you have an appreciated and valued customer added to your list!!

37,"March 07, 2011","I wanted to tell everyone about my experience with Bankston Nissan in Dallas.  Sales - They have the most knowledgeable & friendly sales team that I have ever seen.  They answered all my questions and listened to what I said. We picked the right vehicle the first time around and I didn't have to haggle for hours over the price.  Finance - Their financial team was top notch!  Finance for me has always been the scary part of buying a vehicle.  It's a lot of mumbo jumbo that most people try to rush you through and you feel violated at the end of it.  Not with Bankston, they took the time and made sure I knew everything I was signing, I felt like they were working for me and not the dealership.  I would recommend Bankston Nissan to anyone who is looking for not only a new vehicle but a partner.  Thank guys!",5.0

The first at around 3-4,000 miles when extreme tire wear was noticed. Had it in again for the same problem... asked about help with replacing tires. They thought that was out of the question. Did say we must hit alot of curbs, etc.
Took car to McKinney Nissan at 15,000 miles and again had it aligned which we paid for. At that time, so we could safely take our new car on vacation, bought 2 new Continental tires. $300 to prepare a new car???
This dealership also said once wear starts, aligning and rotating will not stop the uneven wear.
So, both remaining tires need replaced at 26,000 miles. I've never had a car that couldn't easily go 50,000 miles on a set of tires and even wear.
QUESTION.....is there anyway to determine if the car had damage in the 165 miles it was driven before we purchased it???
We think it is very possible.",2.3
41,"January 05, 2007","Unlike the others, my buying experience was excellent. I got a very good price on a Versa. They worked long and hard to get me a good financing rate. I rolled over some negative equity so that typically is a financing nightmare. All and all I would buy from them again. We will see how the service goes later.",5.0
42,"January 03, 2007","I bought an '02 Altima after having a bad experience at a competing dealership the day before.  The salesmen I had was excellent.  He was super friendly and very low pressure.  When they gave me the price I wanted ($1k under asking price) I immediately thought it was too easy and that I should have asked for a lower price.  But I stuck with my offer and away I went.  The car was well worth that price.

My only knock on this dealership was watching the sales manager yell, scream, and act like a horses #@$ to my salesguy.  He was upset because my guy was having my car washed and while he was doing that he lost another potential sale that was wating on him.  I'm not here to say whether or not it was warranted but it was uncalled for to do it in front of a customer who was buying a car solely because of the salesman.   The finance guy was a little 'rough' around the edges too.

This review may be a bit nit-picky but I felt bad for the guy because he had done such a tremendous job with me.  I would go back though.",4.3
43,"September 15, 2006","One week after the purchase of a new 2006 Titan, I call to have a steering pull adjusted. First the service advisor told me wheel alignments were not warranty. I informed him that I just taken delivery on the truck. After getting the sales manager involved, they agreed to fix it. When I picked up the Titan the service advisor advised me that steering pull to the right was normal. (WRONG). 

Also during this visit the dealership scratched the driver’s side window tent supplied with the truck. I then had to schedule and bring the truck in for that repair. I also had to rent a car at MY EXPENSE. 

I have contacted the dealer’s customer relations rep (Carolyn Finley) and after the first conversation, she informed me I would get the rental fee reimbursed and check into the original problem. Days later I have faxed her and called her. NO RESPONCE

44,"June 22, 2006","Went to Bankston in search of a good used car because I thought highly of the location in Irving. I see this 02 Altima that I like and saw the price of $10995. I was kind of curious of the miles because it looked real good. I looked every where on the windshield for it and the only place I saw it was on a teeny-tiny stock sticker. Turns out it had 117,000 Miles. It just dosen't add up in my book. I would stay away!",1.5
