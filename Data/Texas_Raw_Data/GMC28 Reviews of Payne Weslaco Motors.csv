0,"February 29, 2020",I toook both of my vehicles to do service my 2019 Silverado and my 2019 Atlas. We noticed the check engine light on on my Atlas right away they stated it was because they couldn’t reset it. I took it about six weeks later because we noticed our truck still having issues they were rude to my wife and finally they discovered they had let the air sensor disconnected ,1.0

21,"January 18, 2017",I recently had an issue with my ball bearing on my vehicle. My girlfriend's brother had borrowed it one night  and then it came back with that issue. Weslaco Motors service center took care of us and had it done before the end of the day. Price was about $180 so I was okay with that considering that they took care of it so quickly. no issues here! Very polite! ,5.0
22,"December 17, 2016",Have a 2011 Buick Enclave and the air conditioning was not working.  They quoted $1900 plus taxes in parts and $900 in labour to replace AC pump and front and rear evaporators.  We couldn't understand why everything needed changed.  When questioned they knocked the price down about $1000 and said only one evaporator needed changed.  Strange.  We took the vehicle to Beardon AC in Harlingen.  They found one quick coupler leaking and changed two of them.  Added freon with dye to check the system and found nothing else wrong.  Total bill was $84. AC now working fine.,1.0

25,"May 30, 2014",I bought a truck from Ignacio one month with my truck i stared having issues I try  to reaching him never could he help me. Pablo in service got involve.. that he would try to fix the truck every time they would fix the truck it would be the same I would take it in again Pablo wouldn't show up o answer anything!! Finally I decide to turn in the truck as we updated  the carfax It was showing the first owner had an accident and the air bags were deployed.. The value for the truck was low.. We had signed a carfax that was no accident reported and as we updated the new one it was showing the air bags were deployed I spoke to rick carter and it results he didn't know anything and their was nothing he could do..   ,1.0
26,"December 16, 2013","overall service, finance and lack of follow up is what I came across in this dealership. To begin with I had to track a salesman down first off, then after finding the vehicle I liked the finance department sold me an extended warranty that they assured me I needed if my vehicle ever broke down  after only having it for one month it broke down and the service department tells me that the warranty I bought would not cover a loaner vehicle while the person in finance guaranteed I would never be without a vehicle. so I was left without a vehicle not only once twice but three times without no resolve of the same issue that I had to show the mechanics of what they needed to fix. The vehicle I bought was a 2014 jeep grand Cherokee vin#1c4rjeag2ec157788 ",1.6
27,"June 24, 2013",Good group of people there and always great trade in value and sale prices. I would highly recommend this dealership and have recommended this dealership to friends and family,5.0
