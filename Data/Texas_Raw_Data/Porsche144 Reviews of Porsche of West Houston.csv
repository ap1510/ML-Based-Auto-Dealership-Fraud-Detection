2,"June 17, 2020","My 20-something daughter took my new Macan out to run an errand and came in contact with a construction barrel in The Heights. It was a low speed impact but there was scratching on the front bumper. She took the car to Momentum for an estimate - $4000 for repair! She went back to West Houston Porsche, and after assessing that there was no structural damage they were able to restore the car to its former pristine condition - for a fraction of what Momentum estimated. My car looks like new - no signs there was ever any damage. Service was amazing - two day turnaround and wonderful service advisor. Thanks for helping us achieve a complete ""recovery!""",5.0
3,"June 12, 2020","I sent an email through AutoTrader on a used vehicle.  I questioned if the pricing was correct as it was $5K over AutoTrader's KBB's CPO high range for this vehicle.   Internet Sales Mgr Daniel Krol assured me that the pricing is very aggressive and wondered where I got my data from.  I sent him a screen shot of the KBB CPO pricing ($5,312 over the high end of the KBB Fair Market Range(CPO)).  24 hours later, I still haven't heard back from him.
A quick review of West Houston's used Cayenne inventory shows that all of their Cayenne's (as that's all I sampled) were priced at the top end of the KBB CPO high range or well over.  
When they list their vehicles on AutoTrader, they don't designate them as CPO in the system (which doesn't help the look of their pricing); therefore, the KBB on their page show the non-CPO pricing ---- you have to build your own KBB page to see the CPO pricing.  
Anyway, was hopeful to do business with them, but not with their list price being overpriced for the area.  Alas.",1.5

I took the audi r8 it to audi dealership only to find out the car was basically never maintained, oil was black, needed new belts and tensioners, air filters were black, needed a new battery and new key, needed brake pads/rotors, paddle shifter was broken, brake fluid bad, and list goes on!

Never again! Spent over 5k out of my pocket getting all the maintenance and service that shouldve been done when you're a spending 70k on a car from a Porsche dealership.

15,"April 25, 2020","We've not used this dealership previously since we usually get our cars services at Central Porsche Austin and our 996 to a top-line after-market shop in Houston - took the Macan in for a factory re-call.  When I was called to let me know the service was complete, it was accompanied by a list of repair items that were either not yet due or not needed.  I certainly know my car better than the service writer / service tech that's only seen this car for the first time.  I would suggest having your service writer / tech review the specific car's on-line Porsche service records prior to making calls like this one.  In the future, I'll take my Macan along with my 996 to the after-market shop in Houston.",4.2

This is my fourth car purchased through Khalil. He has always advised me well re: cars that suited me well in terms of the kind of driving experience I want and resale value.

It was a fantastic experience with the team at West Houston, who were very responsive and helpful with the trade.

39,"November 22, 2019","I purchased a 2019 Porsche Macan on July 1st. I was denied financing from two banks even though I put 80% down payment and have 800+ credit score. On July 4th, I realized on the copy of the credit application that my income was typed 1/10 of what I wrote on the handwritten credit application. Leah, finance manager, affrimed to me that she submitted the information correctly and sent me a screenshot of the credit application that she sent to the banks. I contacted the banks to verify the income on the credit application that they received and was told it was in fact 1/10th of what it should have been. At this point, I decide to pay off the loan on July 5th. On July 6th, I met with Leah in person to get clarification as to why the banks did not match what she had told me. She finally admits that she did indeed submitted the income incorrectly.

On July 9th, I requested a copy of the handwritten credit application and was told it would be sent. On July 19th, I decide to meet with Leah in person since I have not received what I requested even though she told me it would be sent to me. I also asked why I received another hard credit pull on July 6th even though the deal had already been finalized and the vehicle has been completely paid off before it. No further help to resolve the issues was provided after this.

I have been in contact with Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), Texas Office of Consumer Credit Commissioner (OCCC) and Porsche Cars North America to resolve the issues caused by the finance manager of the dealership. I have successfully removed the credit inquiries as a courtesy to me by the bank and in light of the clerical error by the dealer. I still however have not received the title of my vehicle even though it has been paid off over three months ago.

Due to the lack of commucation and their assistance for a speedy resolution, I recommend everyone to take their business to a different Porsche dealership

42,"November 06, 2019","For the 2nd time I had my 2013 Cayenne Diesel in for what feels like shift slippage between 2nd and 4th gears.  Was welcomed congenially by Ivan and provided a loaner car.  Service kept and drove my car for several days, said they did experience the problem intermittently. but were unable to identify the cause or repair it.  For the 2nd time they sent it home to me and said to bring it in when it happens again.  This could well be a safety issue with shift slip when needing acceleration.

52,"September 16, 2019","I've been a BMW customer for many many years (six cars with them so well over 10 years).  However, I've been eyeing the Porsche Cayenne for a while now but was a little timid of taking that step away from BMW.  For me, BMW's service was my main reason for being so loyal to them these many years.  Fast forward, my husband and I decided one Saturday afternoon to go look and test drive the Porsche Cayenne.  From the minute we parked our car to the end of the transaction, it was absolutely a fantastic experience. Chris was the sales professional that came out and greeted us.  Chris was professional, friendly, extremely patient with all of our questions, and was never pushy at all.  Chris took it a step further by introducing both his sales manager (Mark) and GM (Mariana) to us.  Absolutely down to earth people!  All three individuals made my husband and me feel like they truly want our business (from start to finish).  It didn't feel like ""just a sale"" to us.  With this wonderful first-time experience, Porsche West Houston won us over as their brand new client.  If this is what it's going to be like from here on out (including service), I can see us being a customer of Porsche West Houston for many years to come! ",5.0

56,"August 06, 2019","I'm having an issue with West Houston Porsche. On July 31st I placed a $2,500 down payment over the phone for a 2005 Boxster. 6 hours later, that same day I canceled the car with my Porsche representative. 

The dealership is telling me that they're keeping my down payment claiming that the car was ""taken off the market"". I have proof that over the 6 hours in question the car was not taken off the market both on the West Houston Porsche website or the various alternative auto websites. 

Today I sent a second note to the dealership's GM Marianna Brasel and the GSM Daniel Posey, a note reiterating the timing of my cancellation. I even offered to allow the dealership to keep $600 of the $2,500 ($100 for ea. hour in question). That said, this seems crazy to squabble with an authorized Porsche dealership like its some sort of shady used car outlet. I'm confident Porsche Corporate's intent is not to treat long-time loyal customers in this manner. 

I've purchased two 911s from Porsche, the last one was just five months ago at Porsche Nashua, NH. The experience was terrific, just as I expect from Porsche. 

Please assist.

Service personnel were very helpful and professional, only bad experience was with bad work by painter himself. It was eventually corrected after multiple times visiting dealer and sending car back and forth to painter. This is unexceptable when dealing with a dealer of this caliber. Having to answer the question of recommending this service overall is unfair and a ""Maybe"" selection should be available because I haven't experienced the center for other services.

84,"May 23, 2018","I purchased my used vehicle in March 2018.  I encountered no problems with the vehicle when I took it for a test drive before purchasing.  Less than two weeks after purchasing the vehicle, it had transmission problems and after taking it to a repair shop to have it looked at, I was told it needed a new transmission along with new valve gasket covers.  Total repairs were $8,000 of which the dealership only offered to pay $1,000 in repairs for the valve gasket covers.  I find it hard to believe that these issues were not known before they sold me the vehicle.  I purchased the vehicle ""as-is"" so I suppose that's my fault for not having it looked at before I purchased the vehicle, but I shouldn't have had to do that in the first place.

I was so impressed with the Macan Turbo, that I asked Marisol if she had the color combination I wanted (knowing it was a bit difficult to find).  She happened to have one at a sister property, so I purchased immediately.  The negotiation for the vehicle was seamless and utterly painless, and Marisol and the team even went above and beyond to ensure I had all the features and services I truly needed (and no more).  I was preparing for a surgery in two days time, and while Marisol (and we) thought it would be impossible to achieve, she was able to turnaround the vehicle for pick up the next evening.  

In my visit since (a quick service appointment to set up PCM), Marisol took the time to stop by and ensure my service visit was going well.  Clearly she cares about her customers past the initial sale, and she's proved that by answering any questions I have and following up quickly if needed.

Porsche of West Houston exceeded expectations, and I will certainly go back and see Marisol when I'm in the market for another car.",5.0

1.0 star rating9/20/2017
I want to make it clear that this review applies only to the service dept and the actual work performed on my car. Interactions with all the employees has always been friendly/accomodating. I bought my car at PWest and don't have any complaints about that process. My problem with the service dept is that my car has been returned to me several times with visually obvious errors in work (e.g. missing engine brace bolt, hose clamp dangling on hose, alignment report showing the alignment out of spec, etc) and/or original issue not resolved and/or new issue created. 

I recognize that part of this is due to the fact that dealer wants to make money on service and doesnt get paid the same hours for a job if its warranty vs if customer is paying. On the other hand, the items mentioned above were OBVIOUS errors that reflect either haste, inexperience, incompetence, or combination of all three.

I recently got PCNA involved because the problems continued even after talking to service manager and general manager, but even with all that, my car was returned to me on my most recent visit after having front suspension work done and the side that was worked on started ""popping"". I took the car to Porsche NORTH who fixed it the next day and said ""something was loose"". 

Shame on me for returning to PWest so often (they are closer than PNorth). I wont be going back to PWest again. I want my very expensive, very well engineered, very high performance car to be fixed right the first time (within reason) without having to personally review the work myself OR worry that something wasnt done right.",2.6

Don't get me wrong. The car is beautiful.  It's the people at this dealership that don't deserve to represent it.  The car came 2 days late and was delivered at my home at 11:15 PM in an open trailer.  It was filthy with bird droppings and smudges all over it.  It took me hours to detail it the next day just to make it acceptable to drive.  Car also came with absolutely no paperwork, no title, no purchase agreement, no owners manual no window sticker.  I've contacted the dealership multiple times in an attempt to get the necessary documentation so that I can register the car.  No response from my salesman ""Khalil"" and lip service from their manager Phil Sotolongo.  I've been a gentleman up to this point but enough is enough.  I will be contacting the CEO of Porsche NA so he is aware of the way Porsche of West Houston treats their customers.  If your thinking Porsche look to another dealership.",1.0

Another lie bc all my tires have the same wear and the DOT on both rear tires are same from manufacture date with right rear still have the hole from the nail.

I did some research & it seemed around $40000 was the trade in value for my 2012.
I took my 2012 to the dealer & they offered me $36000 & were charging $300 for a frivolous protection on the new car.
The salesman told me I was way off at $40000 they could best sell it at $42000.
I agreed to $37500 for the 2012 & remove the $300 protection.
I now see my 2012 listed at $45000.
During the last 6 months I have replaced the tires & in August spent $2100 in Porsche West Houston service department having the 4 year service completed.
They will have minimum reconditioning costs on the car.
I realize they are only asking $45000 & may sell it for less but a $7500 mark up makes me feel they undervalued my trade.
I will buying a new Porsche in about 2 years & have the 2014 serviced but it will not be at Porsche West Houston.

130,"March 06, 2015","I purchased a used BMW here at Porsche. The vehicle had a decent price, low miles, looked good and I was promised that it was in perfect condition as any repairs were completed prior to my purchase. After reaching an agreement over phone and email, I flew to Houston from Colorado, completed the deal and drove home. Half way to Colorado, I got a warning message that the coolant level was low. I added a half a gallon of expensive BMW coolant to the tank and continued home. After arriving, I checked the level and saw it was very low again. I contacted my salesman and was told the cooling system was serviced by BMW before I took delivery and the work was warrantied in case there was a problem. That repair order was in my car and after viewing it, saw only 3 hoses running to the tank were replaced.

I took the car to my local BMW shop for service and was told the coolant tank needed to be replaced (not covered by previous repair). In addition, the battery needed to be replaced. The original repair order also suggested the battery be replaced, but apparently Porsche West declined to do so. In total, I had to spend over $1000 2 days after purchasing a car that was supposed to be in perfect condition. My emails to the salesman have gone unanswered. Based on my experience and interactions I viewed with other customers while waiting in the dealership, I would not recommend this dealership. I feel deceived and cheated.

After agreeing with them in the price, I made the deposit and they never contact me back to let me know that they could not have the car that they had sold me. After two weeks, I went back to their shop to understand what was going on and spoke with their sale's manager, Carlos Villaquiran. This man told me that there was not much that he could do and that he had not committed anything to me. The commitment was a problem of his sales person, Errol Hughes, with whom I was dealing with. These guys are so bad in what they do that the car that they tried and could not get it to sell it to me was available in Walter's Porsche in California. I called Walter's and I bought the car through the phone in less than 15 minute conversation. The car was delivered to my house and I am currently driving it.

If you are considering buying a Porsche in the Houston area, I would recommend you to be careful with this guys. They did not honor their words and commitment that they made to me.
