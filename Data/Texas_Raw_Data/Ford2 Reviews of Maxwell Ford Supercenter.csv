0,"August 21, 2017","This dealership is the reason my new car is a Toyota. I have never received more disappointing service. I previously owned a Ford Focus which I took to this dealership to fix a broken door latch. This was a full year before the official recall of the door latches on The Ford Focus so I had to pay over $600 to fix it. It took several days to get my car back. After I received my car which had supposedly been fixed, the door that they had replaced the door latch on was not locking electronically. I called the dealership in hopes that they would look at it for free since this problem had only occurred after they ""fixed"" my door latch and they refused. I spent a whole year driving around with a door that would not lock electronically and because of this my car would make the ""lock"" honk while I was driving. It was so frustrating. Finally, I received a notice from Ford that there was a recall on the door latches so I took my car in to A DIFFERENT FORD DEALERSHIP and scheduled an appointment to have the rest of the door latches replaced. I was so nervous and even explained my previous situation at Maxwell to the people at this new dealership before handing them my car. Well my goodness what a pleasant change. I received my car the next day AND I was told that whoever had replaced my door latch at Maxwell had PUT AN INCORRECT DOOR LATCH ON. So not only did I pay over $600, receive my car several days later, have the door latch for a different vehicle installed that ultimately resulted in my door locking mechanism not to work, but Maxwell refused to ever accept responsibility for their mistake. DO NOT VISIT THIS DEALERSHIP. ",1.0
