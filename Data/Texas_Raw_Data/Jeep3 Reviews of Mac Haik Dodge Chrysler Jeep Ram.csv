0,"November 20, 2018","I took my 2015 Jeep Patriot in to sell.  They offered me $15,500 and told me the offer would be good through the end of the month (so 2 weeks).  I had to organize a few things at home, so told them I would be back in the next day.  Apparently someone talked to someone and realized that they (the dealership or used car folks) entered the incorrect information.  They called me today and reduced the offer to $7k!  I think it is absurd and very shady that they did not honor the written offer that they gave me and told me would be guaranteed till the end of the month.  I wouldn't trust anything they say... I'm so glad I was just trying to sell my car to them and not buying one from them!",1.0
1,"April 14, 2018","Tatianna DeRamus at Mac Haik Temple was a huge help when I was in the market for a used minivan a couple of weeks ago. I ended up buying a certified pre-owned Grand Caravan from her at a great price, and Tatianna made the entire process easy. She was friendly and patient while I throughly checked out the vehicle, and was a great resource for all of my questions and concerns. She really went above and beyond to provide exceptional customer service and make me feel like a valued customer. The management and finance employees I interacted with were great as well, and I’m impressed with the overall experience of buying a vehicle from Mac Haik Temple. It was definitely worth the drive up from the Austin area. If you’re in the market for a vehicle, check out their inventory. It’s not that long of a drive from the Austin area, and Tatianna and her team will likely make it worth your time. ",5.0
2,"October 09, 2016",After I had posted some comments on twitter about the outrageous tactics that Mc Haik Dodge in temple Teaxs was using. CW a salesperson from that dealership asked me to take down the post because his manager was not happy about it and to write a new review about the dealership in exchange for a new and better deal. I agree to it and wrote a new one where I praise the dealership and CW for his outstanding help. A couple days later I called navy Federal to inquire about the actual price of Durango that I purchase only to find out that I was the victim from CW and Mc Haik bad dealership practices and that I was scam into buying the vehicle at a much higher price than we (me and CW aka the salesperson) earlier agreed on. ,1.2
