Jimmy Allen and Ryan went above and beyond to help me and get me into the truck that my business was needing.  Very professional, very polite and attentive towards me.

5,"November 14, 2016","I am very pleased with AutoNation Chevrolet's service department. I was in a bind and really needed my vehicle fixed and back to me in a hurry. They provided me with a loaner vehicle to drive while they were working on mine so I didn't have to miss any work and had my vehicle back to me a lot faster than I anticipated they would. Serena is so friendly, she really cares about other people. ",5.0
6,"October 19, 2016","I wanted a lower priced car for my 16yr old daughter. I had searched for a month with no luck. I had a friend purchase from them and highly recommended them. So I got on line and saw several vehicles in my price range. I went by and talked to Tim, he was very polite and helpful. We drove several cars and found the perfect one for my daughter. Tim helped me get all the paperwork done in about an hour. I am very pleased with my purchase and the free warrenty they gave me for a couple months...who does that on a 137k vehicle anymore. I will be recommending everyone I know and will be choosing them when it's time for us parents to finally upgrade ours.",5.0
7,"July 27, 2016","My husband and I went to AutoNation to find a used vehicle, with a tight budget. I called ahead interested in a vehicle they had and made an appointment. When we showed up, we had to wait around for Tim to finish eating and then joke around with co workers. I should've known then, to just leave. When he met up with us he Didn't even show us the car or even try to give any suggestions to good cars for our family of 4. We talked about our budget, and I said our # was the MOST we could do....it was a very strict budget. I reminded him several times. After running our credit check, etc, he said we were approved and he said it was in our budget. Tim asked if we would like to look at this vehicle. We agreed to look, and test drive. The vehicle was in poor condition in my opinion. Outside damage, as well as very worn on the inside. with high miles. AND the check engine light was on-which I mentioned and he laughed at. After test driving it, I had a bad feeling,when we back to his office he said "" I got it approved for ***"" which was $100 WELL over our budget. I asked him if he had heard me about what I said our budget was and he got an attitude. I assume when someone goes in there with a HARD budget they would get the idea not to go to far over. if it would of been $20 or so I would of been fine. I was not okay with paying that much monthly on a almost 10 year old vehicle with HIGH miles. 

we said we weren't interested anymore and he continued to go down on his payment price- I said I wasn't interested, and he continued to get upset with us. In front of my 2 year old twins. Very disrespectful. he was making rude comments ""surely you could scrounge up the money"" NO we cant. that's why we have budget. 
I will never go back to AutoNation. I will never recommend them to ANYONE. Thankfully the guys next door at tristate ford got us an AMAZING deal. in our budget-low miles-newer suv.

10,"March 11, 2016","My experience at Auto Nation Chevy was very pleasing. The process of landing in a brand new Chevy Cruze was really simple and hassle-free. My brother Craig did a fantastic job in all aspects of taking care of me. It was really awesome. The entire process took no time at all and I was on my way. I love the new Chevy and would recommend friends and family to visit this fine dealership. I was upside down about four thousand on my 2002 Ford F-150 that had 215,000 miles. I got a great interest rate on my car that came with bumper to bumper 10 year , 100,000 mile warranty. This all for a low payment of 460.00$/ mo.

11,"February 27, 2016","John was such an awesome sales consultant for us. He was such a friendly person and connected with us instantly. He showed excellent customer service skills and made sure we were more than happy with our choice of vehicle. We couldn't have asked for a more friendly, down to earth person to work with today. I would recommend any family or friend looking for a new vehicle to come see him specifically as soon as possible. ",5.0

18,"December 31, 2015","My salesman Thomas Sondergaard did a great job explaining the benefits of an electric car. He actually knew a lot about the Volt. Every aspect of my buying experience was above my expectations.

Was  2  1/2 qt low on trans fluid when I brought the car back 4 days later because of irratic shifting .  Service manager Messer could not be reached by phone, would not return phone calls and when I took the car back to get the problem resolved, Mr Messer never introduced himself to me, never shook my hand, never offered any apology for any inconvenience this may have caused and the man was standing two feet away from me.

43,"December 11, 2013","This being the first time in my life I have ever purchased a new car. I find myself lucky to have had Mr. Ellis Hill (sales associate) help me with that decision.  He treated me like family and followed through with exceptional performance.  That is why I rated Customer Service as great.

Not being sure what the ""quality of work"" category stands for?  Is that the work of the sales associate? If so, I can tell you that Mr. Hill never gave me the impression that he was there to collect a paycheck.  He gave me the impression that he truley cared that I was matched up with the right vehicle that met my needs and wants.  That being said the Quality of Work for Mr. Ellis is also rated a 5.

Friendliness.  If you have read the above two paragraphs, then you know why I rated Mr. Ellis a 5!

Overall Experience makes me want to buy a new Chevy everyday!  It was outstanding and I hope when the time comes that the service department is identical to the qualities I witnessed in Mr. Ellis.

Price:  I researched alot of small to small cars on the market today.  I believe for the price range I was looking at this vehicle stands out in the safety market and price arena.  Thank you for making a vehicle of quality and safety.  That being said, I also rate the price a solid 5.

Thank you, 
Jody Kramme

P.S. I just found out that I have to create an account to give this review.  That I do not like.  Had it been for anyone else but Mr. Hill, you probably would not be receiving this review.

49,"December 07, 2013","I have had nothing but wonderful service at Auto Nation Chevrolet, even before when it was Plains.  There are other dealerships close by, but dealing with them in the past, I have been lie to and even had some try to cheat me out of money as a ""Preferred or Family Member"".  From the time you walk in the door, until all the paperwork and you drive away with you vehicle, the folks at Auto Nation Chevrolet are 1st class.  I will and have told people I know looking for a vehicle or service to go see Auto Nation Chevrolet.

When I got to financing my new truck, Scott really did a good job in working with me. I have had my new truck in for service twice since my purchase and both times i have been very satisfied. I would definatley recoomend this dealership to anyone.

57,"March 05, 2013","My husband and I have been trading cars with Plains Chevrolet for several years.  It does not matter wether we are looking for a good used car or if we are buying a new car the sales people have always been very kind to us.  The service department is always friendly no matter if we just having the oil changed or other work done, they are always very prompt and the work is done close to the time we were told it would be.

61,"January 14, 2013","It had been 15 years since I had bought a new truck, so I knew I needed to be sure to get exactly what I wanted, a new Avalanche.  When I buy a new vehicle, I take care of it the best I am able to and keep it a long time.  I had test driven an Avalanche at another dealer, but they did not have the color of Avalanche that I wanted, and they said they preferred not to trade with another dealer just to get the color that I wanted.  That dealer went through no effort to call me back with information that they would look for and find me just what I wanted.  At Plains Chevrolet, Jack Pierce and Scott Morris were very friendly and helpful to me.  They listened to what I had to say, and they were willing to work with me, and even give me more suggestions on what I might like.  They both went the extra mile to find the color of Avalanche, the bright blue color.  I was very impressed that Plains Chevrolet found the blue color that I wanted, but what is even better, they found an upgraded model with the Bose Radio, which is my favorite in sound systems, and the beautiful black leather and wood grain style interior.  Plains Chevrolet was also helpful in finding me the best interest rate from one of the best banks, since I had excellent credit.  Plains also gave me a very good trade in price on the vehicle I traded in, a 2006 Mustang GT.  Overall, I am very pleased with Plains Chevrolet, and buying a new vehicle there became a friendly and personal experience, as well as knowing that they will be good to work with in the future on routine or other maitenance.  Jack Pierce deserves an extra thanks for contacting me about my interest in a new Avalanche.  I had never been to Plains Chevrolet before, and if he had not initially contacted me with a phone call, I may not have known how great Plains Chevrolet is.  Plains was also helpful in showing me around the service department and getting to know the employees there, and the best maintenance program for my new Avalanche.  Above all, they went the extra miles, or many extra miles, to find and transport back the new Avalanche for me from the original dealer that had my Avalanche.  And the new Avalanche was delivered just two days later, and I was able to take possession that day.  Jack was also helpful showing me how the electronics and OnStar worked int the vehicle.  I am pleased to have bought my new Avalanche from Plains, and will certainly recommend them to all my friends in the future.  Sincerely, Judy Haley",5.0
62,"July 15, 2012","After researching the three different cars that I was interested in, I then shoped from Amarillo to Dallas for the best deal. The above mentioned sales representives at Plains were very nice and made the best deal of anyone that I had tryed to buy from. You have to do your research before you go to any dealer and get many prices in writing. I learned that a lot of these out of town super dealers will tell you anything and change the deal when you arrive. The team at Plains Chevrolet bent over backward to be honest...very honest on pricing and the extended warranty. They worked as a team to make my purchase as smooth as it could be. ",4.5
63,"June 25, 2012","My wife and I bought a car from Plains Chevrolet and was told that it had been in a wreck but they assured us that it had been fixed and restored back ""the way it was supposed to be"" to quote the sales manager. They told us that they would not have put it on the lot to sell if they were not sure that it was a certified used vehicle. They also told us it would still be under the manufacturers warranty with a 36,000 bumper to bumper and a 100,000 mile drive train warranty. They assured us we could buy with confidence. Well, after we bought the car we ended up having to take it back several times for several problems. Believe me, it has been nothing but trouble. Finally when the vehicle only had 23,000 miles and less than 3 years old the paint started popping off the front bumper and they refused to fix it. All I can say is if you buy any vehicle from Plains Chevrolet, you had better get every detail you can think of in writing and be prepared to endure the worst customer service experience I have ever had from any dealership in the Amarillo, Texas area. Good luck!!!!!!!!!",2.0
64,"September 23, 2011","When I first bought my truck in 2009, these folks were great.  They paid for my first service at 3000 miles, they constantly called to make sure things were going Ok.  At about 8500 miles, I started noticing noises, several different ones.  One was fixed after waiting 2 weeks for a new door panel. One was blown off, telling me that ""its normal"".  Its not freaking normal dude, if a clunk comes from the rear end when you put it in reverse, thats not normal. And the other, a belt squeal, is still on going after 3 trips to the shop for repair on this particular issue. Atleast they had the decency to put me in a loaner while they had mine, but that was in my factory warranty period, now I'm at 50k, and I doubt they would do it now. Now, no matter when or where I call from, I can't get a single person to answer the phone. I just finished letting the phone ring for about 5 minutes before it went to voicemail.  I called the numbers I had from when I first started doing business with them, and then I called the numbers currently on their website.  I'll be going to a different dealership when I'm ready to trade in, possibly a different brand all together, though it goes agains everything I stand for. This place is just after your money, like most, but once they have it, they're done with you until the next time you want to trade up.",2.6
65,"October 31, 2007","I purchased a truck, they wrote up a service order for a hitch. It took several weeks to get it put on, then they put on a used old hitch without any type of electrical hookup, not the hitch they took off the truck to sell on another truck, like they said they would. Because the service letter just said ""Hitch"" they would not make it right. I went as far up the totum pole as I could get. I guess what little it would have cost them to do us right, was worth us telling others about the poor service. There is a right and a wrong way to take care of things and they give ""used car salesman"" a bad name.

Beware of any promised repairs, be spacific in the order, that they use new parts!!!!
