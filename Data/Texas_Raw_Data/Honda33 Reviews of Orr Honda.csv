8,"May 31, 2018","This is the 2nd vehicle I have purchased from Orr Honda in Texarkana.  I traded in my 2013 Honda Pilot for a 2018 Honda Accord. Based on my research,  I felt I recieved a really good deal, below MSRP and a very good trade on price. The dealer was Brad Morgason. He was very knowledgeable af the Accord and answered all the questions I had. The sales manager, Steve Lucas, was very helpful in closing the deal.  I had mentioned that I had lost my wedding ring a couple weeks back and to keep an eye out for it in my Pilot.  Even though I had looked several times, 3 of the Orr employees searched it again. Although they didnt find it, they tried. I've only had my accord for a day, but so far, I love it. ",5.0
